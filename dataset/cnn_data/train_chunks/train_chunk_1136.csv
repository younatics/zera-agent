"Heather Barnes, 20, a marine biologist student at the New College of Florida was swept out to sea Friday off the coast of Honduras. Barnes was on a school trip and decided to do some early-morning coral collecting when her leg cramped and the tide pulled her away from the reef, starting a 16-hour nightmare that would leave Barnes hallucinating from dehydration with severe sunburns, jellyfish stings and blisters. Miraculously, she made it back to shore alive - by herself. Scroll down for video... Survivor: Barnes endured severe sunburns, jellyfish stings, blisters and hallucinations from dehydration during her 16 hours in open water . On Friday, the last day of the trip, Barnes couldn't sleep so she decided to do a little pre-dawn snorkeling to collect coral samples - as she had done every morning of the trip. But while she was swimming alone in the . coral reefs around Cayo Grande, she started cramping in her stomach and . leg and was pushed out to sea by the ocean currents. At first Barnes thought it would be safer to try and stay in the same place, thinking that her group would soon notice her missing and send search and rescue crews after her. After two hours of idling and no sign of other life, she decided she would have to swim back herself. Just keep swimming: The red line shows Barnes' path out to sea, while the green line charts her swim back. The short blue line is the route locals took to kayak her back to her resort . 'It's kind of strange because even when I didn't feel like I was strong enough, there was enough of me that still wanted to keep going. It didn't seem like a choice. I just - I had to keep going,' Barnes told ABC News. And kept going she did. Sixteen hours after she first went out to snorkel, she made it back to land where locals found her and kayaked her back to the resort she was staying at. It turns out that her group had noticed she was missing when she didn't turn up to breakfast at 7:30am. Sandra Gilchrist, the professor supervising the trip, notified authorities and rescue boats were out in the water searching for Barnes twenty minutes later. 'I was furious with her when we realized she had gone out with herself. She knows better,' Gilchrist said. 'The search was immediately on.' The rescue team grew to include 100 people by noon, including officials from two governments, coast guards, scuba divers, kayakers and locals on all the islands. But when no one spotted Barnes everyone grew to fear the worst. When the locals brought back Barnes, her professor still couldn't believe her student was alive. 'My first reaction was I thought they were bringing back her body, because it was so long and it was dark. Then, one of my students came out and said, ""She's alive! She's alive!""' Gilchrist said. 'Everyone broke out in tears and grabbed her.' Gilchrist is going to make sure that an event like that never happens again under her watch. Next year she plans to make it mandatory for students to wear bright orange life vests when out snorkeling, and is even thinking about GPS devices that track the students in the water. 'Bottom line, though, don't go out by yourself,' she said. It had been a long sixteen hours for Barnes. She endured severe sunburns, jellyfish stings, blisters, and hallucinations from dehydration, but is alive and recovering at her grandmother's house in Florida. 'I'm safe, well loved, and ready to take a break from the beach for a while,' Barnes wrote on Facebook.

"A Delta flight from New York to Florida was rerouted Monday due to passenger disruption - the third incident of its kind in less than a week. Flight 2370 left New York at about 7pm, en route to West Palm Beach, but was forced to land in Jacksonville after a row broke out over reclining seats. A spokesman for the airline said: 'Out of an abundance of caution, the captain elected to divert to the closest airport. Local law enforcement met the flight and removed the passenger.' Scroll down for video . Flight 2370 was forced to land in Jacksonville due to an undisclosed passenger disturbance (file picture) Don't lean back: A lack of space on planes has led to heated arguments among passengers (file picture) According to the airline, the diversion was 'due to safety reasons in regard to a passenger issue' but Florida television station WPTV reported that the plane rerouted due to a dispute over a reclining seat. Passenger Aaron Klipin told the station a woman sitting next to him got into an argument with a passenger behind her. The woman reclined her seat so she could knit while the other passenger was trying to sleep on the tray table. Klipin said the woman who was trying to take a nap started screaming and swearing, drawing the attention of the flight crew. According to the passenger, when a flight attendant came over, the dispute between the two women became even more heated, and the woman with her head on the tray table demanded that the plane be diverted. Klipin recalled hearing the woman say: 'I don't care about the consequences; put this plane down.' Another traveler who spoke to ABC's Good Morning America described the woman as 'nuts,' saying that she launched into a tirade about her dead pets. 'She said, ""I lost two dogs in the last month. I want her [the reclining passenger] off of here, or I'm going to leave; or I want you to stop the plane.' The stewardess went to talk to the pilot, who made the decision to land the plane 'out of an abundance of caution,' according to a Delta spokesman. A few minutes later, the flight touched down in Jacksonville, where it was met by local law enforcement officials who removed the unruly woman from the plane. The flight later continued on to West Palm Beach, arriving after 11pm. The Knee defender, pictured, consists of two small plastic clips which prevent the seat in front reclining . This is the third similar incident, after diminishing leg room contributed to two clashes just last week. On Wednesday August 27, a American Airlines Miami-to-Paris flight was rerouted to Boston after air marshals had to restrain a man as two passengers came to blows when one of them attempted to recline their seat. The male passenger, Edmund Alexandre, of France, continued to be disruptive when a  crew member tried to calm him, following him down the aisle and grabbing his arm. Two undercover federal air marshals on the flight then subdued  and handcuffed the 61-year-old traveler. Cosy: A file picture of passengers on a Delta airlines flight. Rows over limited leg room have caused disruption . And on August 24, a fight started on a United Airlines flight when a male passenger resorted to using a Knee Defender, a $21 gadget designed to prevent the person in front  from reclining. A female passenger, sitting in the middle of Row 11 tried to recline, but found she couldn’t. When it emerged that the man in the seat behind had attached a Knee Defender, she asked a member of cabin crew  to remove it. He refused, saying that he would no longer be able to work on his laptop, and the situation escalated, with the woman hurling a glass of water in the man’s face. The New Jersey-to-Denver flight was diverted to Chicago, and both of the passengers were booted off. Reclining has long been a contentious issue, with surveys finding that as many as nine out of ten passengers believing that reclining seats should be banned on shorter flights. There is even a campaign on business networking site LinkedIn to make airlines remove reclinable seats on short-haul journeys.","Plane bound for Florida was forced to land in Jacksonville after disturbance .

"Taking a moral stand: Prime Minister David Cameron said it was time to teach right from wrong . David Cameron last night called on the Archbishop of Canterbury to lead a return to the ‘moral code’ of the Bible. In a highly personal speech about faith, . the Prime Minister accused Dr Rowan Williams of failing to speak ‘to . the whole nation’ when he criticised Government austerity policies and . expressed sympathy with the summer rioters. Mr Cameron declared Britain ‘a Christian country’ and said politicians and churchmen should not be afraid to say so. He warned that a failure to ‘stand up . and defend’ the values and morals taught by the Bible helped spark the . riots and fuelled terrorism. At Christ Church Cathedral in Oxford, . where Dr Williams used to teach, Mr Cameron said the time has come for . public figures to teach ‘right from wrong’, and questioned whether the . Church of England has done enough to defend those values in the face of . the ‘moral neutrality’ that pervades modern life. And taking aim at the Archbishop, Mr Cameron tackled head-on his public criticisms of the Government over the last 12 months. The speech was a bold Christmas gamble . by Mr Cameron. In making a speech about religion, he did something that . Tony Blair always longed to do but was talked out of by spin doctor . Alastair Campbell, who flatly told him: ‘We don’t do God.’ The clash between the Government and . Church is at its most acute since former Archbishop of Canterbury Dr . Robert Runcie clashed with Margaret Thatcher’s government in the 1980s. The Prime Minister appeared emboldened . by his opinion poll bounce since his decision to wield the veto during . the Eurozone crisis summit in Brussels last week. Admitting that he had ‘entered the . lion’s den’ by addressing an audience of churchmen, Mr Cameron said: ‘I . certainly don’t object to the Archbishop of Canterbury expressing his . views on politics. Challenged: The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, should take the lead in promoting Christian teachings, according to the Prime Minister . ‘But just as it is legitimate for religious leaders to make political comments, he shouldn’t be surprised when I respond. ‘I believe the Church of England has a . unique opportunity to help shape the future of our communities. But to . do so it must keep on the agenda that speaks to the whole country.’ At . an event to mark the 400th anniversary of the publication of the King . James Bible, he said: ‘We are a Christian country and we should not be . afraid to say so. 'The Bible has helped to give Britain a set of values . and morals which make Britain what it is today. Values and morals we . should actively stand up and defend. ‘Whether . you look at the riots last summer, the financial crash and the expenses . scandal or the on-going terrorist threat from Islamist extremists . around the world, one thing is clear, moral neutrality or passive . tolerance just isn’t going to cut it any more. David Cameron said it was 'easier for people to practise other faiths when Britain had confidence in its Christian identity' ‘Put simply, for too long we have been unwilling to distinguish right from wrong. “Live and let live” has too often become “do what you please”. ‘Bad choices have too often been defended as just different lifestyles. To be confident in saying something is wrong is not a sign of weakness, it’s a strength.’ Mr Cameron’s demands for a ‘moral code’ were directed at human rights apologists and Left-wing politicians who recoil from promoting Britain’s Christian heritage. But they also covered the hand-wringing pronouncements of many senior churchmen, who refuse to condemn lawbreaking by rioters and show unwillingness to take on militant Islam for fear of offending Muslims. The PM said an ‘almost fearful, passive tolerance of religious extremism’ had let Islamic extremism grow unchallenged and called for the promotion of ‘Christian values’ saying it was ‘profoundly wrong’ to believe that promoting Christianity would ‘do down other faiths’.","PM said it's easier to be Jewish or Muslim in Britain than in a secular country like France .

"Gannaro Gattuso has admitted he wants to be the next manager of Rangers after the Ibrox club finally confirmed Ally McCoist is working a 12-month notice period. The Italian World Cup winner spent a short spell in Glasgow in the late 1990s as a teenager before moving on to Salernitana then AC Milan. The 36-year-old revealed: ‘My wife is from Glasgow but the main reason to want to go there is because Rangers is a big team with big stories. VIDEO Scroll down to see Gattuso lose the plot during OFI Crete press conference . Former AC Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso has revealed he would like to be Rangers' next manager .

It would be the job and the chance to work for a big club which is in my heart. There are many reasons, not just my family.’ Currently in charge of OFI Crete, Gattuso claims he tried to quit the Greek side in October because he felt his players didn’t believe in him but changed his mind 24 hours later after talks with fans. The Heraklion-based side currently lies a lowly 15th in the Super League after a 2-0 defeat at Panionios on Sunday. ‘Two years ago I started as a manager at Sion and now I am carrying on my time in football in Heraklion,’ he continued. Rangers confirmed on Monday that manager Ally McCoist had resigned from the club . The former combative midfielder, who previously managed Palermo, is currently in charge of OFI Crete . ‘My situation at Crete is not simple. I wanted to leave but the fans would not let me go and that is okay. ‘I only played for a year and a half at Rangers but it was a big pleasure to do that so, of course, I would be interested in the job there.’ Gattuso is thought to be one of a few options the Ibrox board is considering. McCoist tendered his resignation on Thursday, although the news was leaked just a few hours before a 2-0 defeat to Queen of the South on Friday night. After three days of silence in Govan, the club confirmed the move in a statement to the London Stock Exchange on Monday morning.","Gennaro Gattuso is currently in charge of Greek side OFI Crete .

"This image show attendees at a conference in Saudi Arabia on the topic ‘women in society’ – and not a single one is female. The conference, reportedly held at the University of Qassim last year, was attended by representatives from 15 nations, apparently all men. The seats in the hall are filled with men in traditional Arab dress apart from one wearing a blue chequered shirt. No girls allowed: A 'Women in Society' conference in Saudi Arabia which judging by this picture had an all-male attendance . The photograph was published in a Saudi newspaper last year, and has since been making the rounds on social networks. Twitter users have branded the image ‘absurd’, ‘the height of misogyny’ and ‘astonishing’ as the internet responded to what is only the latest proof of the gender gap in the Middle-Eastern nation. Segregation between men and women in the oil rich country is widespread due to the ultra-conservative Wahhabi sharia law. Restrictions mean they are not allowed to drive, they must use separate entrances at banks and offices, and a plan to build a city for female workers only has been announced. Restricted: Although they are now allowed to ride bikes and motorcycles, women in Saudi Arabia are still very much controlled by their fathers, brothers and husbands . They also need permission from a male relative or their husband to work, travel, study or marry and a woman's testimony counts for less than that of a man in a court of law. Small steps towards gender equality has been made in the past year. Earlier this year, King Abdullah appointed women to 20 per cent of the 150-member Shura Council, an unelected body which advises the Government. In April, Saudi Arabia lifted the ban preventing women from riding motorbikes and bicycles, but only if they are accompanied by a male relative and dressed in full veil.","Conference on 'women in society' held at Saudi Arabian university .

"The Polar Vortex Part II is getting ready to roll back into town. Leading meteorologists are warning the Mid-Atlantic is in for a repeat of last winter, which was noted as the 34th coldest such period for the contiguous 48 states as a whole since modern records began in 1895, according to weather.com. Now, with a month-and-a-half left of fall, the forecasts are in, and another polar vortex looks set to hit the Northeast from January and not let up for months. Accuweather are reporting that New York will again experience above-average snow and freezing temperatures, however neither is expect to hold out as long as the brutal winter of 2013/14. 'I think, primarily, we’ll see that happening in mid-January into February but again, it’s not going to be the same type of situation as we saw last year, not as persistent,' AccuWeather.com Expert Long-Range Forecaster Paul Pastelok said. Scroll down for video . Get ready: Winter will arrive without delay, according to Accuweather.com, with frigid air from another polar vortex seeping down into the country's midsection and Northeast as early as November . Here comes the snow: Meteorologists are predicting higher-than-normal snow totals for cities west of the I-95 corridor. Washington, D.C., Boston and New York will also be affected, and Philadelphia will be hit hard . Reprieve: In some good news for the Midwest, the area is expected to experience temperatures seven to nine degrees warmer than last year, with noticeably lighter snow forecast for Chicago and Minneapolis . 'The cold of last season was extreme because it was so persistent. 'We saw readings that we haven't seen in a long time: 15- to 20-below-zero readings.' People in more than two dozen states from the Southeast to the Northeast felt last year's polar vortex - a weather phenomenon where frigid air breaks free from the North Pole and plunges south, according to News Mic. This year higher-than-normal snow is predicted for cities west of the I-95 corridor, including Baltimore and Harrisburg. Around 70 inches of snow is also expected to slam Philadelphia. Washington, D.C., Boston and New York will also be affected. Bitter: Ice floes fill the Hudson River as the Lower Manhattan skyline is seen during sunset on January 9, 2014.

For the rest of the country, Accuweather expressed concern for the area between Tennessee Valley and the Gulf Coast. Warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, which have not been cooled this year by a tropical cyclone, could provide extra fuel for winter storms in the south, according to MSN. The region will experience a predominantly wet winter. In some good news for the Midwest, the area is expected to experience temperatures seven to nine degrees warmer than last year.

There are also predictions of below-normal snowfall. Chicago and Minneapolis are especially not expected to get as much snow as previous years. The northern and central Plains will endure roller-coaster temperatures, Accuweather said. For the west coast, there is no suggestion the record-drought in California will worsen.

"'Extremely dangerous': Mark Lazarus has been jailed indefinitely . An 'extremely dangerous' cross-dressing sex attacker with an obsession for skirts tried to rape an elderly women while wearing one of the garments. Mark Lazarus waited outside a public toilet in Teignmouth, south Devon, for more than hour until someone wearing a skirt went in. He followed a 71-year-old into the toilets and went into a cubicle to change into skirt and tights himself, before pouncing on the woman as she washed her hands. The terrified pensioner needed medical treatment for shock after heavily-built Lazarus dragged her into a cubicle where he tried to have sex with her. She was only saved from the ordeal because she screamed for help and Lazarus fled - still wearing his skirt - and was seized by a brave passer-by who made a citizen’s arrest. Lazarus, 39, was jailed indefinitely at Exeter Crown Court for the attack. The court was obsessed with skirts and carried out two previous attacks while dressed as a woman, in one of which he walked behind a group of schoolgirls muttering ‘skirt, skirt’. He was rated as extremely dangerous in risk assessments carried out by a psychiatrist and probation officer and highly likely to commit further attacks. Lazarus, who is from Tiverton, but was living in a hostel in Howell Road, Exeter, admitted attempted rape and was jailed indefinitely. Judge Phillip Wassall told him he could not apply for parole for at least four years. The judge told him: 'If this lady of 71 had not resisted, you would have carried on and raped her. She received sever psychological trauma and now needs counselling. Lazarus, 39, was given a custodial sentence by a judge at Exeter Crown Court (pictured) 'You have a predilection for dressing in skirts and that is exactly what you did when you went out looking for sexual stimulation and intending to commit a sexual offence. 'You saw this lady entering the toilet and you were attracted to her because she was wearing a skirt. You thought ‘skirt’ to yourself and that triggered this violent sexual attack. 'She was a vulnerable lady in a public situation and you attacked her for your sexual gratification. It was only because she fought you off and made so much noise and commotion that you stopped and fled. 'The public minded citizen who grabbed and tackled you and held on to you deserves commendation. This attack was cunning and conceived and but for her perseverance you would have completed the offence. 'There was an element of stealth and cunning. It was predatory behaviour with a chilling echo of your previous offending. 'The reports say that you acknowledge you are a high risk to women and you told the probation officer you don’t think you will ever change. 'You are in my view extremely dangerous. You are likely to re-offend with potentially incalculable consequences for the public. 'You victims are likely to be confronted by someone wearing a skirt and tights and that is likely to impact on them even more than a stranger rape in other circumstances. 'It was predatory behaviour with a chilling echo of your previous offending' 'Your risk of reoffending increases . when you cross dress. This offence highlights your fascination with . skirts. It seems that anyone of any age, from schoolgirls right up to . ladies of this age, are at risk.' Mr . Sean Brunton, prosecuting, said the attack took place in February when . Lazarus took a train to Teignmouth with a skirt and tights on under his . clothing and waited outside the toilet block until a suitable victim . entered. He followed her in, stripped off to his skirt and tights, and attacked her as she washed her hands. Mr Brunton said: 'He got her to the floor and she pulled back from him and screamed. He later told police that if it had not been for her screams he would have raped her. 'The victim said she was pushed to the ground and Lazarus lay on her and simulated sex. She was bruised and suffered psychological effects. She said she was devastated and was petrified by her ordeal.' Lazarus was held by passer-by Sean Pope, who saw him fleeing the toilets in a skirt and tights and seized him, holding him until police arrived. While being held on the ground Lazarus himself dialled 999 and made a full confession. Mr Brunton said Lazarus is originally from Tiverton and his previous sexual offences took place on the banks of the River Exe in the town in July 1999. On both occasions he dressed as a schoolgirl and followed young girls along the towpath, assaulting an 11-year-old and exposing himself to others. Mr William Parkhill, defending, said Lazarus deserved credit for being totally candid to both the police and probation about the extent of his sexual obsessions. He said that while reports currently rate him as extremely dangerous, it is possible he could benefit from many years of psychiatric treatment in prison.","Mark Lazarus waited outside a public toilet for more than an hour before someone wearing a skirt walked in .

"Not only does billionaire Donald Trump not 'regret' questioning President Barack Obama's birth place, Trump now says there's 'a very good chance' president Obama pretended to be Kenyan in order to attract financial aid money in college. 'Because if you say you were born in Kenya, you got aid, and you got . into colleges,' Trump said, 'People were doing that.' The Apprentice star told Washington-based reporters on Tuesday that he still doesn't understand why president Obama would turn down a $50 million gift to charity if he's telling the truth about his past. Donald Trump, chairman and president of the Trump Organization, said today it's possible that president Obama was born in the U.S. but lied on college applications and said he was from Kenya. 'Because if you say you were born in Kenya, you got aid, and you got into colleges,' Trump said . Trump's disbelief that Obama is indeed an American citizen, as required by law to hold the presidency, stems from a typo in a book agency's 1991 biography of Barack Obama, in which Obama was listed as being from Kenya. After the bio surfaced in 2012 a former editor at the book company said it was 'a fact checking error.' Trump isn't as sure the line itself was a mistake as he is that then-Illinois state senator Barack Obama made a mistake in having it put in his promotional materials. Even after Obama released documentation of his birth, Trump said he remained unconvinced. Several days before the 2012 presidential election, Trump announced that he was offering President Obama $5 million to put toward a charity in his home town, Chicago, Illinois, if he turned over his birth certificate, passport and college records. Trump says he later increased that amount to $50 million, a number that was not reported in the media at the time, but Obama still wouldn't play ball. ' I never heard from him,' Trump said on Tuesday, adding that he would take the money if it were the other way around. 'The Donald' got on the subject of Obama's background today after he was asked during the Q and A portion of a National Press Club luncheon if he regretted his past statements about the president's birthplace. 'Not even a little bit,' Trump said. 'I don't regret it.' 'Why would I regret it?' he asked amid applause from the audience. Trump said there were three scenarios to explain Obama's past: 'Either it's fine, or he was born in Kenya, or in my opinion there's a . very good chance he was born here, and said he was born in Kenya. Because if you were born in Kenya, you got into colleges, and you got . aid,' Trump said. 'Very simple.' Though many Americans have tired of Trump's quest to see Obama's personal records, Trump claims people on the street are still asking him to pursue the issue. 'Now I hope that it's 100 percent fine,' Trump said, but later mentioned 'I'd love to see what's put down.' Believe it or not, Donald Trump's hair is real . 'They attack my hair. It's mine,' Trump said during his speech while yanking on his head. 'Would anybody like to inspect?' Unlike Obama, Trump says he's all facts and no fiction. His hair? Totally real, Trump said on Tuesday. 'They attack my hair. It's mine,' Trump said during his speech while yanking on his head. 'Would anybody like to inspect?' 'They say you wear the worst hairpiece I've ever seen, what a horrible wig,' he continued, explaining that he's made it clear on Twitter that his hair is real, yet people keep claiming it's fake for some reason he said. 'You know it's funny, but when people wanna keep going, they keep going,' Trump noted. The billionaire was less forthcoming about whether or not he has any big political plans for 2016. 'We’re going to see what happens in ‘16,' he said. ' If I don’t see the . right person, I will do something in ’16.  I will do it sure as you’re . sitting here.'","Donald Trump still doesn't understand why president Obama wouldn't accept his offer to put $50 million toward a charity of the president's choice if he's telling the truth about his background .

"Sunderland and Leicester are interested in signing out-of-favour Hull City defender Curtis Davies. The 29-year-old has played 13 times for the Tigers this season, but has lost his place to James Chester for their last two Premier League matches. Nigel Pearson's Leicester were in for the 29-year-old before his move to Hull last year, but were unable to secure a deal for the City captain. Curtis Davies is the subject of potential January bids from both Leicester City and Sunderland . The Hull City captain was a mainstay in Hull's team last season, but has lost his place in the last fortnight . Davies signed for Steve Bruce's side in June 2013 for £2.25 million, and Hull will not want to sell without making a significant profit on the former England Under 21 international. It has been suggested that Bruce's supposed willingness to sell Davies is to enable him to free up funds for incoming transfers in the January window. Hull face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, where Hull are expected to stick with the centre-back partnership of Michael Dawson and Chester. Davies (right) is pictured vying for the ball with Liverpool striker Rickie Lambert on October 25 . Davies scored to put Hull 2-0 up against Arsenal in the FA Cup final in May, but Arsenal came back to win 3-2 .","Curtis Davies signed for Hull for £2.25 million in June 2013 .

"A drunken secretary has admitted hurling racist abuse at fellow passengers on the London Underground after a video of her appeared on the internet. Jacqueline Woodhouse, 42, directed a drunken, expletive-ridden rant at passengers on the Central Line between St Paul’s and Mile End stations on January 23. The court was told that Woodhouse had . drunk an 'unknown' quantity of champagne at a retirement party before . getting on the Tube at 11pm. She now faces jail, after police launched an investigation into a seven-minute long video of the verbal assault that was uploaded to YouTube. Scroll down for video . Vile: A child in the Central Line carriage looks on as Jacqueline Woodhouse hurls abuse at other passengers . Foul-mouthed: Woodhouse was caught on camera making racist remarks as she travelled on the Underground . It has since been viewed more than 200,000 times. Today . at Westminster Magistrates’ Court, Woodhouse, of Romford in Essex, . admitted causing harassment alarm and distress to the Sikh man who filmed her . - Galbant Singh Juttla. The video clip begins with Woodhouse shouting in a thick Essex accent about 'foreign s*** heads'. She turns to her passengers and asks: 'Where do you come from? Where do you come from? Where do you come from? 'I would like to know if any of you are illegal? I am sure like 30 per cent of you are.' She then turns on the Pakistani man sitting next to her, who is singing his national anthem, and threatens to 'punch him in the face.' 'I wouldn’t mind if you loved our country,' she adds. She then turns to Mr Juttla's camera, as he assures her he would rather be listening to his music than to her. Woodhouse pleaded guilty to one count of causing racially aggravated 'harassment, alarm or distress' by using 'threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour' after she was filmed by Galbant Juttla, right . 'Oh look he’s filming, hello,' she says. 'Hello government.' She goes on: 'Why don’t you tell me where you’re from?' He replies: 'I am British.' She gets her phone out of her black handbag and looks as if she is filming him too. Mr Juttla warns her: 'Watch what you are saying.' She replies: 'I used to live in England and now I live in the United Nations.' As he tells her to keep her mouth shut, informing her that she has had too much to drink, she becomes extremely agitated and starts screaming. 'It’s not your country anyway so what’s your problem?' she yells. 'It’s been overtaken by people like you.' The court heard that Mr Juttla decided to film Woodhouse after she started berating an unidentified black female. She then sat down between two men and began another barrage of abuse. Woodhouse ignores the anger of other passengers as she continues her aggressive seven-minute tirade . Prosecutor Claire Campbell told the court: 'She then leaned towards the gentleman sitting next to her and said ‘I will have you arrested because you do not live here’. 'The male pushed her away and she fell on to the adjacent seat. 'She stated: ""I hope you are not claiming benefits and I hope you pay your taxes"". 'Mr Juttla responded: ""I pay more taxes than you, love"". 'Mr Juttla pulled the emergency alarm fearing an escalation of events and to enable her to be removed from the train.' Single father of two Mr Juttla, from Ilford, Essex, had been attending a funeral of a close family friend that day. Ms Campbell said Woodhouse went to Mile End police station following a media campaign.Woodhouse told police she could not remember the rant but recognised it was her in the video. She attended court today wearing a black suit and white shirt. She sat in the court with her brow furrowed and her head bowed as the magistrate was shown the video clip. Appalling behaviour: The court was told that Woodhouse had drunk an 'unknown' quantity of champagne at a retirement party before getting on the Tube at 11pm . Ms Campbell told the court that Woodhouse was fined following a similar offence on the Docklands Light Railway in December 2008. Ms Campbell said Woodhouse verbally abused a male passenger while on a train to Stratford. She asked whether he had paid taxes, adding: 'I have had enough of it, why don’t they go back to where they come from?' Outside court Mr Juttla, who runs a print company, said: 'I found it very distressing. 'I uploaded it to YouTube because I thought that was the fast-track process to catching this person. 'I also needed to show the public that kind of person is out there and not to put up with this kind of behaviour. 'My kids have seen the video and they are disgusted by it. They don’t expect for someone to shout abuse at their dad.' Before officers asked him to take the video down, it had been watched 21,000 times. Since duplicates have been made, it has been watched by hundreds of thousands of people. Spate of incidents: Police took Emma West into custody in December after a video . (pictured) appeared on the internet showing a woman apparently abusing . tram passengers . Mr Juttla added: 'She needs to be set an example of. People should look at what happens to her and say ""we can’t behaviour like this in the public domain"".' Woodhouse pleaded guilty to one count of causing racially aggravated 'harassment, alarm or distress' by using 'threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour'. The prosecution offered no evidence on one charge of racially aggravated common assault. Adjourning sentence, District Judge Elizabeth Roscoe said: ‘Bearing in mind the level of abuse, the persistence of the abuse, the number of people on the train unable to leave without aborting their journey, and the children present, means that I think the court has to have a pre-sentence report. ‘I make it clear that all options are open to the sentencing court, including committal or immediate custody.’ The judge imposed stringent conditions banning her from the Tube network and she was ordered to keep to a daily curfew between 10pm and 6am, which will be monitored by electronic tag. She will be sentenced at the same court on May 29. The video emerged after a spate of similar clips were uploaded on to the internet. Emma West was charged with a racially aggravated public order offence in connection with an incident on a tram in December.

Her Majesty wore an elegant light blue coat and matching hat for the ceremony, which took place at St George's Chapel in the grounds of the Berkshire-based royal residence. Also at the service were the Duke of Edinburgh, Sophie, Countess of Wessex, Princess Anne and Princess Eugenie. A portrait of the Queen by the renowned British photographer David Bailey was released today to mark her 88th birthday tomorrow. Scroll down for video .

'In Rwanda tears are still shed each day as the horror of genocide is remembered.

"Careering down a hillside in pursuit of a rolling wheel of cheese, the daredevils of Cooper’s Hill are used to flying in the face of the health and safety brigade. But this year they have been stopped in their tracks after police stepped in and threatened the 86-year-old woman who provides the showpiece cheese for the centuries-old event. For 25 years, Diana Smart has provided hand-made 7lb rounds of Double Gloucester to be chased by enthusiastic participants in the annual cheese rolling. Scroll down for video . Big cheese: Diana Smart, 86, from Gloucester makes the cheese that is chased down Coopers Hill in Gloucestershire by thrill-seekers. Police have told her not to do it this year . But yesterday it emerged the octogenarian received a ‘heavy-handed’ visit from three police officers, who advised her to cease her involvement. They visited her farm in Churcham, Gloucestershire, and told her she could be personally liable for any injuries suffered by those taking part. The unique event has been held for over 200 years on the Whitsun Bank Holiday in May and has been known to attract thousands of ‘chasers’ and onlookers. It involves competitors speeding after the 12-inch cheese down a hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. The first to the bottom wins the cheese. Mrs Smart, who sells her wares to luxury grocers Fortnum and Mason, has been providing the cheese since 1988, but says she has been forbidden from doing so for this year’s roll on Monday. She said: ‘We are not allowed to give . them cheese this year. The police came to my farm and said it could . cause us an enormous amount of damages. ‘I just have to take it as they have . said. We cannot do anything about it. It’s crackers the fact that the . police came round and warned me not to give the event some cheese.’ She continued: ‘I like doing it. It’s always brought me such joy and a smile. The police were so heavy-handed. ‘They threatened me, saying I would . be wholly responsible if anyone got injured. I’m 86, I don’t have the . will or the cash to fight any lawsuits. It’s crazy. Cheese charge: Daredevils chase the cheese at Coopers Hill, Gloucestershire as part of the historic event . Mrs Smart with one of her cheese wheels. Every year the massive cheese has been rolled down the hill - followed by brave competitors . ‘It’s such a shame – the police are using scare tactics on businesses because they can’t break the will of the locals.’ The annual cheese rolling consists of . five races – three for men, one for women, and a safer uphill chase for . children. Injuries suffered at the event have included broken arms, . legs and backs. Following health and safety fears . 2009 was the last official cheese rolling event – but it is still put on . unofficially by a group of ‘rebel rollers’ from Brockworth, who hold . informal races without proper medical cover or insurance. Slip and slide: The event started in the early 1800s and sees daredevils chasing cheese down the 200-yard Cooper's Hill near Brockworth . Dazed: A rescue worker helps a competitor injured during the 2006 event. Broken bones and other injuries have been reported at previous events . And organisers say they will continue to defy any bid to stop the race happening. One said yesterday: ‘It’s outrageous. Completely unbelievable. You cannot . stop someone selling cheese. If they try to stop us, we will use . something else or get some cheese elsewhere.’ A Gloucestershire police spokesman . confirmed: ‘Advice has been given to all those who have participated in . any planning of an unofficial cheese rolling event this coming bank . holiday.’","Diana Smart, 86, has made the wheel for 25 years .

"A wartime bomber hero was today celebrating 70 years of marriage to the radio operator whose voice he fell in love with as she guided him home from a bombing mission over Germany. Flt Lt Steve Stevens, 91, first heard Maureen's calming voice as she guided him back to RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire following the mission in 1943. The 21-year-old Lancaster pilot was so intrigued by hearing a female's voice from the tower, he went to have a look after landing. Steve and Maureen Stevens were today celebrating 70 years of marriage (left) after they first met as she guided the former RAF pilot home from a bombing mission over Germany. The couple were married (right) eight months after he plucked up the courage to ask her out . But he 'crept away' again after seeing 'this glamorous girl sitting in the middle of a crowd of people, the centre of attention'. However, the Bomber Command airman, who went on to win the prestigious Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC), eventually plucked up the courage to ask WAAF girl Maureen Miller out. They got married in her home city of Norwich eight months later at the height of the Second World War. Mrs Stevens said: 'Steve first fell in love with my voice. They loved to hear my voice, and I loved to hear theirs. Flt Lt Stevens (left) went on to win the prestigious Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) while his wife Maureen (right) played a pivotal part in the Dambuster raid, talking the returning crews back to land after their mission in Germany . The couple point to Mr Steven's flying logbook entry which shows the flight he was on when they very first talked over the radio, an official transmission that led to their long marriage . 'The first time I went into a control tower I was petrified. I had never been near an aircraft before. 'Then, . my first night on duty, a plane took off and went up in flames. I went . racing down the stairs, I just wanted to get out, but the man in charge . pointed to my seat and said, ""Miller! Your place is there"". 'So I came back and sat down.' By the time the couple tied the knot Mrs Stevens had played a pivotal part in the Dambuster raid, talking the returning crews back to land after their mission in Germany. Mrs Stevens (left) had been working as a proofreader when she volunteered for war work while Mr Stevens (right) became a pilot after his family home was bombed . Led by Wing Commander Guy Gibson, the . 617 Squadron shattered the Moehne and Eder dams with Barnes Wallis's . bouncing bombs - sending floodwater raging through the Ruhr Valley. The story of Steve and Maureen Stevens bears a resemblance, in part, to the 1946 film A Matter Of Life And Death. The film, set in England during the Second World War, sees Squadron Leader Peter Carter, played by David Niven, as a British Air Force pilot who orders the crew of his burning Lancaster bomber to bail without telling them his parachute has been shot up. He manages to speak to English-based American radio operator June, played by Kim Hunter, for a few minutes before jumping, without a parachute. After miraculously surviving the fall he ends up meeting June and they fall in love. But a celestial court is set up to determine the afterlife's claim on him. Through . the dawn of May 17, 1943, and for hours afterwards, Mrs Stevens sat . listening in the desperate hope that more men would make it home. Eight . of the 19 Lancasters which took off from RAF Scampton that night did . not return and 53 of the 133 aircrew involved were killed, a casualty . rate of almost 40 per cent. Mr Stevens, who was in 57 Squadron, had to wait in his bomber on the airfield before taking off on his own test sortie that night as the elite Dambuster boys soared up into the black sky. Today the couple still live in the Norwich semi-detached house they moved into more than 60 years ago. Mr Stevens, who will be 92 later this month while his wife will be 94, failed to turn up to their first date after he was scrambled to go on another raid - and had forgotten to ask for her name. It was only when he heard her voice on his radio a second time, from a different base, that he persuaded her to give him another chance. Within weeks he had proposed. Mr Stevens waves from the cockpit of a restored Lancaster bomber . Mrs Stevens said: 'I think it went something like, ""If I'm alive at the end of the year, we'll get married"". 'I wasn't the marrying kind. I didn't want to get married. I was the youngest of seven and had four older sisters and I used to say I didn't want to be like them and spend my life with one person. 'But I remember thinking, very early on, that he'd make someone a good husband.' Soon afterwards she was always listening out for one voice in particular while on duty in the control tower. Mr Stevens, pictured stood beside a Wellington bomber during the war, flew 30 raids and said he did not expect to survive the war . She said: 'I still remember the time his plane came in late. 'The control tower officer was worried, but I said, ""He'll be all right"". And he was.' Mrs Stevens had been working as a proofreader when she volunteered for war work. She said: 'I thought I would be doing some sort of clerical work. 'But in the interview they kept me talking for a long time and then said they had something different for me.' She was trained as a radio telephone operator and her voice welcomed pilots home after countless raids. Mr Stevens, who grew up in Devon, became a pilot after his family home, after they had relocated to London, was bombed. On the night of May 23, 1943, he flew his first trip as a Lancaster captain. In November 1943, just days before his wedding, Flt Lt Stevens shook hands with King George VI as the monarch awarded him the coveted DFC. He flew 30 raids and said he did not expect to survive the war. But he carried on flying for the RAF after the war and took part in the Berlin Airlift in 1948 as Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin tried to cut off the German city. He also trained as a teacher and taught maths at schools across Norwich, including the Norman, Avenue and Earlham schools. After her war service Mrs Stevens worked as a secretary for Colman's for 30 years and Mr Stevens was president of the Lakenham branch of the British Legion for 25 years. Their son Adrian studied at Cambridge and became a university lecturer, specialising in medieval French and German. He and his wife Janey returned to Norwich this week to help celebrate his parents' platinum anniversary.","Flt Lt Steve Stevens fell in love with her voice as she guided him home .

"Lawmakers in Gambia have passed a bill imposing life sentences for some homosexual acts, officials have said this week. The bill amending the criminal code was passed last month and brings life imprisonment for 'aggravated homosexuality', a charge which includes people living with HIV/AIDS, minority leader Samba Jallow told The Associated Press. Under Gambian law, amended in 2005 to apply to women as well as men, homosexual acts were already punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The bill now awaits approval by President Yahya Jammeh (pictured), one of Africa's most vocal anti-homosexual leaders who in 2008 instructed gay men and women to leave the country or risk having their heads cut off . Jallow said that while his National Reconciliation Party did not condone homosexuality, he voted against the latest bill along with one other lawmaker. 'In our view, (homosexuals) did not commit a crime worthy of life imprisonment or any treasonable offense,' he said. The bill now awaits approval by autocractic President Yahya Jammeh, one of Africa's most vocal anti-homosexual leaders who in 2008 instructed gay men and women to leave the country or risk having their heads cut off. Speaking on state television in February, Jammeh said, 'We will fight these vermins called homosexuals or gays the same way we are fighting malaria-causing mosquitoes, if not more aggressively.' Jammeh, who came to power in a 1994 coup and is famous for speeches condemning Western powers, has not addressed the new bill publicly. National Assembly Speaker Abdoulie Bojang confirmed the new bill was passed last month but would not provide further details. Uganda's Anti-Homosexuality Act, which drew widespread international condemnation, was overturned last month by the country's Constitutional Court. Pictured is Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni as he signs the anti-gay legislation in Kampala, Uganda . A draft seen by The Associated Press contains language identical to a controversial anti-gay bill signed into law in Uganda earlier this year. In addition to 'serial offenders' and people living with HIV/AIDS, both pieces of legislation say examples of 'aggravated homosexuality' include when the suspect engages in homosexual acts with someone who is under 18, disabled or has been drugged. The term also applies when the suspect is the parent or guardian of the other person or is 'in authority over' him or her. It was not immediately clear whether there were changes to the draft prior to the National Assembly vote. Uganda's Anti-Homosexuality Act, which drew widespread international condemnation, was overturned last month by the country's Constitutional Court, which declared the law illegal because it was passed during a parliamentary session that lacked a quorum. Human Rights Watch reported in May that the legislation had triggered 'a surge in human rights violations,' including arrests, police abuse and evictions. Gambia has previously launched occasional crackdowns on gay people in the country. A 2012 raid at a poolside birthday party in the capital, Banjul, led to the arrests of 18 men, some of whom said they were interrogated and beaten before undergoing a very public trial that destroyed their reputations. The new bill could make life even worse for gay people in Gambia, said Francois Patuel, West Africa campaigner for Amnesty International. 'It only adds to the discrimination and to the climate of fear that gays and lesbians ... are living under,' Patuel said.","Bill amending criminal code was passed last month and includes life sentences for some homosexual acts .

"Dr Mehmet Oz today offered to help 'drain the swamp' of unscrupulous marketers using his name to peddle so-called miracle pills and cure-alls to millions of Americans desperate to lose weight. Appearing before the Senate's consumer protection panel, Oz was scolded by Chairman Claire McCaskill for claims he made about weight-loss aids on his TV show, 'The Dr. Oz Show'. Oz, a cardiothoracic surgeon, acknowledged that his language about green coffee and other supplements has been 'flowery' and promised to publish a list of specific products he thinks can help America shed pounds and get healthy - beyond eating less and moving more. On his show, he never endorsed specific companies or brands but more generally praised some supplements as fat busters, including green coffee extract, raspberry ketone and garcinia cambogia. 'Exaggerations': Celebrity doctor, Dr Mehmet Oz, testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington on Tuesday, where he was scolded for claims he made about weight-loss aids on his TV show, 'The Dr. Oz Show' Not impressed: Senator Claire McCaskill scolded Dr Oz for claims he made about weight-loss aids on his show . McCaskill took Oz to task for a 2012 show in which he proclaimed that green coffee extract was a 'magic weight loss cure for every body type'. 'I get that you do a lot of good on your show,' McCaskill told Oz, 'but I don't get why you need to say this stuff because you know it's not true.' Oz, who made his TV debut on the Oprah show, insisted he believes in the supplements he talks about on his show as short-term crutches, and even has his family try them. But there's no long-term miracle pill out there without diet and exercise, he said. 'I recognize they don't have the . scientific muster to present as fact but nevertheless I would give my . audience the advice I give my family all the time,' he said. 'I have . given my family these products.' Scam: After Dr Oz praises products on his show, companies then use his image to sell them, he said . Claire McCaskill, the senator who attacked Dr Oz for supporting weight-loss supplements, showed people just how it should be done - by losing weight with healthy eating and exercise. 'I'm tired of looking and feeling fat. Maybe talking about it publicly will keep me on track,' she wrote on Twitter in 2011. She went on to share updates of her fitness goals and eating habits on her profile. 'It's official. I have divorced bread and pasta,' she wrote in one tweet to her thousands of followers. 'I'm hoping someday we can be friends again.' After just five months, she reached her goal of losing 50 pounds. But McCaskill responded: 'The . scientific community is almost monolithically against you in terms of . the efficacy of the three products you called miracles.' Within . weeks of Oz's comments about green coffee - which refers to the . unroasted seeds or beans of coffee - a Florida-based operation began . marketing a dietary supplement called Pure Green Coffee. It claimed that the chlorogenic acid found in the coffee beans could help people lose 17 pounds and cut body fat by 16 per cent in 22 weeks, and charged $50 for a one-month supply. The company, according to federal regulators, featured footage from 'The Dr. Oz Show,' to sell its supplement. Oz has no association with the company and received no money from sales. Last month, the Federal Trade Commission sued the sellers behind Pure Green Coffee and accused them of making bogus claims and deceiving consumers. The weight-loss industry is an area where consumers are particularly vulnerable to fraud, Mary Koelbel Engle, an associate director at the FTC, testified at the Senate hearing. Advice: Dr Oz, pictured on his show, agreed that his language about supplements has been 'flowery' She said the agency conducted a . consumer survey in 2011 and found that more consumers were victims of . fraudulent weight-loss products than of any of the other specific frauds . covered in the survey. Oz . stressed during the hearing that he has never endorsed specific . supplements or received money from the sale of supplements. Nor has he . allowed his image to be used in ads for supplements, he said. 'If . you see my name, face or show in any type of ad, email, or other . circumstance,' Oz testified, 'it's illegal' - and not anything he has . endorsed.","Celebrity doctor, Dr Mehmet Oz, was slammed by Claire McCaskill for praising weight-loss aids on his show, The Dr Oz Show .

"The FBI is apparently closer to answering how a groom fell overboard on his honeymoon cruise seven years ago after discovering new footage from on board the ship. George Smith, 26, vanished from the Royal Caribbean ship, Brilliance of the Seas, in the middle of the night on July 5, 2005. He had been partying into the early hours with his 25-year-old wife Jennifer Hagel-Smith and new friends. The investigation into the death of Mr Smith, from Connecticut, has remained open and authorities have an incriminating video tape in their possession which may lead to an arrest. Scroll down for video . Unsolved: George Smith, 26, vanished from a Royal Caribbean ship in the middle of the night on July 5, 2005 after partying into the small hours with his wife Jennifer Hagel-Smith . According to Cristin Marandino from Greenwich Magazine: 'On that videotape there are certain individuals that make very self-incriminating statements following the death of George Smith. 'This is a videotape that the gentlemen made of themselves. And in their room, sort of passing around a flip phone.' On the evening of July 4, 2005, the newlyweds had been drinking at a disco on board. Exact details have remained unclear but it was believed that during the night, the couple became separated. After Mrs Smith went to bed, her husband was believed to have fallen into the Aegean sea, near the Turkish port of Kusadasi. The couple had been together for three years when they married in 2005 in a clifftop ceremony in Newport, Rhode Island. Mystery: George Smith's family and wife Jennifer (pictured right) have never had closure since his disappearance in the middle of the night on the Aegean Sea near the Turkish port of Kasidasi . Mrs Smith, an elementary school teacher, and George, who had taken over his family's successful liquor store business, embarked on a romantic honeymoon cruise through the Mediterranean. However after the Fourth of July, Mrs Hagel-Smith awoke to find that her husband was not in the couple's cabin. Lost hope: A photograph taken by a passenger showed blood on the edge of a lifeboat canopy . She was not immediately worried, believing he may have fallen asleep in the care of new friends. According to a report by Greenwich Magazine this month, Mrs Smith had forgotten fighting with her husband at the disco, passing out in a hallway and being returned to her room by security guards. Later that morning, after a search for her husband on board, the ship's captain broke the news to the newlywed that he had probably fallen overboard. The 26-year-old's body has never been found. At the time, a large stain which appeared to be bloody fingerprints on a railing was photographed by a 16-year-old guest. The mark on the metal lifeboat canopy was reportedly then washed away by staff. Another passenger, 21-year-old Josh Askin, who had spent the night drinking and gambling with the couple, was interviewed by Turkish police along with a distraught Mrs Smith. Nightmare: George Smith went missing from Royal Caribbean's Brilliance of the Seas in 2005 while on his honeymoon . Never found: Mr Smith, 26, fell from the boat during a Mediterranean cruise close to the port of Kusadasi in Turkey . Mr Askin's father, Dr Jerry Askin, managed to videotape the interview of his son and several other young men, including two Russian brothers Greg and Zach Rozenberg, according to CBS in 2006. The group of men, who had been among the last to see George Smith, explained that they had been drinking then escorted an inebriated Mr Smith to his room. Mrs Hagel-Smith was under suspicion for a time by the FBI along with several others on the cruise ship. No one has ever been charged with a crime. Back in the news: The case of the missing 26-year-old Mr Smith captivated the American public in 2005 and the story was back on a billboard in Times Square this week . Mr Smith's family continue to believe that he was murdered. The Greenwich Magazine reported that  his relatives were relieved new developments had come to light in his disappearance. Mrs Hagel-Smith remarried to financial analyst Jeff Agne in 2009 at the age of 29. The Smith family and their former daughter-in-law grew apart after she reached a $1.1 million settlement with Royal Caribbean Cruises in 2007. She has said that while George may have been murdered, he also could have fallen to his death. The FBI were looking into transferring the case from Connecticut to New York, where it is believed potential suspects live.","Body of George Smith, 26, has never been found after he went missing on Royal Caribbean ship in Aegean Sea in July 2005 .

"More than half of families receive more in benefits than they pay in taxes, new figures showed today. New research reveals how the welfare system dramatically narrows the gap between the richest and poorest. However, income inequality has risen sharply after falling to its lowest level for more than 25 years. Overall 13.8million households, 52 per cent of the total, received more in benefits and services than they paid in taxes in 2012-13, the Office for National Statistics said. As well as state benefits paid direct to claimants, it includes services such as education and healthcare. The figure is unchanged year-on-year and is down 1.8 per cent since 2011 but is still 8.2 percentage points higher than in 2000. Tim Knox, director of the Centre for Policy Studies, said: ‘This small fall in the proportion of households who receive more in benefits than they pay in tax is welcome. ‘But the fact that over half of all households receive more in benefits than they pay in taxes should be deeply shocking. ‘There is still so much more to do to get us back to the long term average of around 45 per cent.’ Analysis of the effects of tax and benefits shows how the state redistributes wealth each year. The wealthiest households earn 15 times more than those on the lowest incomes, but after paying tax and receiving benefits the difference is reduced to just four times. Before taxes and benefits the richest fifth of households had an average income of £81,300 compared to just £5,500 for the poorest fifth of families. ‘Overall, taxes and benefits lead to income being shared more equally between households,’ the ONS said. ‘After all taxes and benefits are taken into account the ratio between the average incomes of the top and the bottom fifth of households (£59,900 and £15,600 per year respectively) is reduced to four-to-one.’ On average, families paid £7,400 per year in direct taxes, equivalent to 19 per of their gross income. The richest fifth of families paid on average £20,300 per year in direct taxes, the vast majority of which was Income Tax. ‘This corresponds to 24 per cent of their gross income, broadly unchanged from other recent years,’ the ONS added. Cash benefits made up 56.4 per cent of the income of the poorest fifth of households (£7,200), compared with 3.2 per cent (£2,700) of the income of richest fifth . However, the figures also showed disposable income increased by £940 for the richest fifth of households while it fell for all other families, including a £381 drop for the poorest. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘The gap between rich and poor is growing again after a brief post-crash pause. Last year the richest households got richer, while everyone else got poorer. ‘This is further proof that most people are failing to have a fair share in the benefits of recovery. ‘The return of rising inequality should worry everyone as it suggests that nothing has been learned from the financial crisis despite the huge fall in living standards that so many people are still experiencing.’ As a result there was a slight increase in income inequality between 2011/12 and 2012/13, based on the Gini coefficient measure. The number can vary between 0 and 100 and the lower the value, the more equally household income is distributed. The Gini coefficient for the disposable income of all families was 33.2 per cent, up from 32.3 per cent in 2011-12 - the lowest figure since 1987.","52% receive more in benefits and services than they pay for, ONS says .

"Carlos 'Halfy' Rodriguez lost a large portion of his brain and skull after flying through his car's windscreen and landing on his head . Speaking out for the first time, many thought that his appearance was fake - until now . 'That is why it is not good drinking and driving, or drugs and driving. It is no good kids,' he warns. But despite his anti-drugs stance it appears he still continues to smoke cannabis every day . A bad boy who was left with half a head following a dramatic accident has spoken out for the first time - blaming his astonishing appearance on a drink and drugs binge. Carlos 'Halfy' Rodriguez, who also goes by the name Sosa, lost a large portion of his brain and skull in a crash after flying through his car's windscreen and landing head-first on the road. In a new video he has used his appearance and story to warn others not to drink and take drugs. Doctors were forced to cut away large amounts of flesh and bone to help him survive and he has since been able to continue his life in Miami, Florida. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Incredible: From side on the damage caused by his crash is obvious . Both sides: 'Halfy' as he is now known, shows his skull to camera in this new video . Warning: Carlos admits that he was on drink and drugs while driving and warns others not to do the same . From the front: Carlos speaks to camera for the first time and from this angle the damage to his head is not clear . 'I was barred out on drugs. I was driving and I hit a pole and flew out the front window and landed on my head,' he said in a new warning message on You Tube. Showing his head to camera he added: 'And this is how the old boy has come out. That is why it is not good drinking and driving or drugness (sic) and driving. It is no good kids.' According to the German tabloid Bild he had the accident aged 14. 'I was with a cousin and a friend stole the car, there was a near-fatal car accident. As the speed was too fast we lost control of the car and crashed,' he said. Mr Rodriguez shot to fame two years ago after he was was arrested for allegedly soliciting prostitution. Miami Police had problems with their paperwork and his forms contained no name and simply the description 'half a head'. Infamous: Police released these mind-bending mugshots 18 months ago, and many believed them fake . His mugshots, showing his missing forehead and battered skull, spread across the world online but many thought that it was a hoax. However this new video has proved that he and his extreme injuries exist. Bad boy: 'Halfy' still smokes drugs, despite his warning to others . But despite his serious message to stay . away from narcotics, it appears that he is yet to change his ways after . admitting he still smokes a lot of drugs. Survivor: British teenager Ben Maycock was lucky to be alive after a brutal hammer attack left him a huge dent in his skull . In a bizarre tirade he also accuses American President Barrack Obama of doing the same. 'This is what I do daily: burn a stake,' which is slang for a joint. 'Obama is the President of ya'll United States and he smokes. (Expletive) has the whole White House growing. 'Then why can't I smoke me a blunt?'. 'Halfy' is not the only person to survive with half a head, as several other Britons have done the same. Teenager Ben Maycock was lucky to be alive after a brutal hammer attack left him a huge dent in his skull in 2010. The vicious assault left Ben's head shattered - and doctors had to hack away huge chunks in a battle to save his life. Medics at Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, doubted Ben would survive his horrific injuries, and told his grief-stricken mum to prepare for the worst, but incredibly, he survived.","Carlos 'Halfy' Rodriguez lost a large portion of his brain and skull after flying through his car's windscreen and landing on his head .

"Determined to fight again: Matador Juan Jose Padilla bears the scars from the goring he suffered during a bullfight as he faces the public for the first time . A Spanish matador blinded in one eye after being gored during a bullfight today vowed to do the 'unspeakable' and return to the ring as he made his first public appearance since the horrific incident. Juan Jose Padilla was speaking at a press conference just six days after undergoing a crucial operation to repair nerve damage in the left side of his face, which was left paralysed in the attack. Bearing scars next to his jaw and left eye where he was pierced by the bull's horn, he said it was his dream to don the famous uniform once again and insisted he did not want pity. 'I do not want the fans to feel sorry . for (me),' he told media at Virgen del Rocio hospital in southern . Seville before returning home. 'I . will fight again dressed as a bullfighter because this is my dream to . meet the fans,' he added before referring to the motto 'Strength . Padilla' which have flooded social networks in recent weeks. The crowds at . the Zaragoza's Fiestas Del Pilar bullfight at the Misericordia ring were . left stunned when the bull's horn pierced his jaw and emerged through . his left eye socket in October. With blood gushing from his head, he was helped out of the ring screaming 'I can't see, I can't see'. He . then underwent a life-saving five-hour operation to repair severe . damage to his eye, bone, muscle and skin. He said he was feeling better than . three weeks ago and was 'very excited' about his recovery following his . treatment under the direction of maxillofacial surgeon Alberto Garcia . Perla. Gored: The bull's horn pierced Padilla's jaw and emerged through his left eye socket after his fight went horribly wrong in the northeastern city of Zaragoza's Fiestas Del Pilar . The operation Mr . Padilla underwent last Tuesday aims to rebuild the facial nerve severed . in the goring which left him with difficulties swallowing and talking. Mr Padilla will face a long rehabilitation process that will begin in a couple of weeks at a recovery centre. It is hoped the operation will recover around 80per cent mobility in his face. Mr . Padilla said: 'I want to thank the Hospital Virgen del Rocio and the . entire medical team for giving me the opportunity to return to normal . life and giving me the hope of returning to the arena.' Mr Padilla in his heyday (left) after killing a bull in Nimes, France, in 2009 and (right) speaking to the media at a press conference at the Virgen del Rocio Hospital yesterday where he vowed to wear the iconic uniform again .

Hope: Mr Padilla is confident he will recover enough to go back into the ring to face bulls again . Accompanied by his wife, Lidia, his . parents and his attorney, Taurine Sanlúcar Diego Robles, Padilla was . given a standing ovation before moving to his home in Sanlucar de . Barrameda in Cadiz.

"Trayvon Martin's girlfriend - the state's star witness -  testified today about the last phone call he made before he was shot dead in which he described George Zimmerman following him. Rachel Jeantel, 19, told the court she asked the teen what the man looked like and he said he looked creepy, 'a creepy-a** cracker'. She said Trayvon told her he was going to go home but the man was still following him, saying 'Oh sh**, the n**** is still behind me'. 'I just told him to run,' Rachel told the court, adding that she heard a 'hard-breathing man' in the background. The pair then got cut off and when she called him back he told her he was back at his father's fiancee's house and he thought he had lost the man. Scroll down for video . Girlfriend: The government's star witness in the George Zimmerman prosecution is 19-year-old Miami woman Rachel Jeantel . Testimony: Rachel said Trayvon told her he was going to try to lose the man and go home, but Zimmerman kept following him . When asked about why she lied about not going to the funeral, she said: 'I felt guilty...I was the last person that talked to their son', before breaking down in tears . One friend told MailOnline that Rachel was absent often from school after getting mixed up with a wrong crowd she had met through her older brothers . Manicure: Rachel tweeted a picture of her 'court nails' on Sunday and later deleted it, though it is still on her Facebook . Day three: George Zimmerman enters the courtroom for the third day of his trial in Seminole circuit court on June 26 . 'It was about to rain when he was going . to 7-Eleven', said Jeantel. They talked about the All-Star game which Trayvon left at halftime to go to the store. It was . raining, so Trayvon took a shortcut on his way back home, she said. That's when he revealed 'a man was watching him'. Jeantel said she told Trayvon she was worried the man was a rapist. Trayvon said to 'stop playing with him like that'. She then told the jury - made up of five white women and one Hispanic - she heard Trayvon ask the man, 'Why are you following me?' and that he said, 'What are you doing around here?' She then said she heard Trayvon’s phone headset fall and him saying: 'Get off!' When asked about why she lied about not going to the funeral, she said: 'I felt guilty...I was the last person that talked to their son', before breaking down in tears. Jeantel also said the screaming voice on 911 calls, which she heard through media outlets after her friend's death, 'sounded like Trayvon'. After Martin's death, Jeantel said she found out about the incident from a friend's text message and decided not to go to his wake because she didn't want to see his body. At times during her testimony she dabbed away tears, as did the father of Trayvon Martin. The defense is expected to call her credibility into account after she tweeted about the case and discussed 'getting high' and 'driving drunk' He would come to her neighborhood to ride bikes and play games, she said. They met in second grade but lost touch until 2006. She denied being his girlfriend as she has frequently been described as up to this point. Earlier today a neighbor of Zimmerman cried . as she testified about hearing a boy's cry for help shortly before . she heard a gun go off. But Jayne Surdyka also testified on . the third day of testimony in Zimmerman's murder trial that she heard . multiple gunshots, 'pop, pop, pop'. Only one shot was fired in the fatal encounter between Zimmerman and 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. 'I . truly believe the second yell for help was a yelp,' said Surdyka, who . later dabbed away tears as prosecutors played her frantic 911 call. 'It . was excruciating. I really felt it was a boy's voice.' Hard to hear: Trayvon Martin's parents listen as Rachel Jeantel talks about the last phone call Trayvon made before he was shot dead .

Diagram: Witness Jane Surdyka, left, points to a map of The Retreat at Twin Lakes being held by Assistant state attorney Bernie de la Rionda . Surdyka told the court that before the shooting, she heard an aggressive voice and a softer voice exchanging words for several minutes. 'It was someone being very aggressive and angry at someone,' she said. During the struggle, she said, she saw a person in dark clothes on top of the other person. Martin was wearing a dark sweatshirt and Zimmerman wore red clothing. Surdyka said she saw the person who was on top get off the body after the shot was fired. During cross-examination, defense attorney Don West tried to show there was a lapse in what Surdyka saw. Defense attorneys contend Martin was on top of Zimmerman during the struggle, but after the neighborhood watch volunteer fired a shot, Zimmerman got on top of Martin. West also challenged Surdyka about her belief that the cry for help was a boy's voice, saying she was making an assumption about whose voice it was. Another neighbor, Jeannee Manalo, testified after Surdyka that she believed Zimmerman was on top of Martin. Manalo also described hearing howling, but she couldn't tell who it was coming from. Neighbor: Witness Jeannee Manalo testified that she believed Zimmerman was on top of Martin and also described hearing howling, but she couldn't tell who it was coming from . Accused: Zimmerman, 29, could get life in prison if convicted of second-degree murder for gunning down Martin as the young man walked from a convenience store . Cross examination: Defense attorney Don West questions witness Jane Surdyka during George Zimmerman's second-degree murder trial . George Zimmerman speaks with attorney Lorna Truett: He has claimed self-defense, saying he opened fire after the teenager jumped him and began slamming his head against the concrete sidewalk . Under cross-examination, defense . attorney Mark O'Mara asked why she had never mentioned her belief that . Zimmerman was on top in previous police interviews. He made her read back a transcript of an interview in which she described only seeing shadows. Other neighbors also have described hearing cries for help that were captured on their calls to 911. Martin's parents have said they came from their son, while Zimmerman's father has said he believes the cries belong to his son. Both prosecutors and defense . attorneys believe they could show whether Zimmerman or Martin was the . aggressor in the encounter at the Retreat at Twin Lakes townhome complex . on February 26, 2012. Defense attorneys successfully argued against allowing prosecution experts who claimed the cries belonged to Martin. Also today, Judge Debra Nelson . announced that an alternate juror — a young, Hispanic man — had been . dismissed for reasons unrelated to the case. The juror, a maintenance technician, . said during jury selection that he also competed in arm wrestling . competitions and could do a one-armed pull-up. His dismissal leaves only a middle-aged white man on the jury panel along with eight women. He is currently an alternate . Graphic: The State of Florida shows photos of .

Candy: Diana Smith, crime scene technician for . the Sanford Police Department, shows a bag of Skittles, which was . collected as evidence, to the jury during Zimmerman's trial today . The judge also ruled this morning that she would allow at trial five police dispatch calls Zimmerman made in the months before his encounter with Martin. Prosecutors want to use the calls to bolster their argument that Zimmerman was increasingly frustrated with repeated burglaries and had reached a breaking point the night he shot the unarmed teenager. Prosecutors played the calls for the judge Tuesday with the jurors out of the courtroom. The recordings show Zimmerman's 'ill will', prosecutor Richard Mantei said. 'It shows the context in which the defendant sought out his encounter with Trayvon Martin,' he said.Zimmerman, whose father is white and whose mother is Hispanic, has denied the confrontation with the black teenager had anything to do with race, as Martin's family and its supporters have charged. There were emotional scenes in the Sanford courtroom yesterday as jurors were shown graphic pictures of Trayvon's body - including close-ups of the gunshot wound - after he was killed. His parents Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton left the room shortly after the harrowing images were projected onto a large screen. Sanford Sgt Anthony Raimondo was called to the stand yesterday afternoon - the same sergeant who was described in opening statements as the one who tried to 'breathe life' into Trayvon. Under cross examination he explained what he found after arriving on the crime scene 'within five minutes' of when the 911 call was made. He described in detail how he found Trayvon's body lying face down on the grass with his hands underneath him. He checked for a pulse twice and turned him over to perform CPR. As he tried to revive the teen, he told the court he could hear bubbling sounds coming out of Trayvon's chest as he attempted to resuscitate him. He asked people who had come from their homes after the shooting for Saran wrap and Vaseline to plug the wound. One of the bystanders brought him a plastic bag. Later, jurors were shown pictures of the Arizona fruit juice can and pack of skittles the 17-year-old had just bought in the 7/11. Crime scene technician Diana Smith presented several pieces of evidence to the court room as well as describing the area where she put yellow markers down. Prosecutor John Guy asks Smith to point out and describe each item at the scene - which included a flashlight, cell phone and plastic bag as well as the skittles and juice can.","Rachel Jeantel said she told Trayvon to run after he said: 'The n**** is still behind me'

"A crew member of long-running reality TV show 'Cops' has died after getting shot during filming last night. The as-yet unidentified crew member was holding a microphone during the filming of a gun-fight with an armed robber in Omaha, Nebraska. The robber also died in the incident, in which officers fired an estimated 30 shots. It was later revealed that the suspect, a parolee from Kansas, was actually carrying an Airsoft rifle which only looks like a firearm. Police are expected to speak more about the deadly incident in a press conference at 2:30pm. Scroll down for video . Scene of the shoot-out: Wendy's restaurant at the corner of 43rd and Dodge Street, Omaha, Nebraska - where a 'Cops' cameraman was shot and an armed robber was killed during a gun-fight last night . The shoot-out unfolded after police patrol cars responded to a back-up call in relation to a raid taking place at a Wendy's restaurant in Omaha, Nebraska, just after 9pm. In an audio of the police radio call posted by @MeanStreetsOMA on Soundcloud, an officer can be heard describing a suspect in a 'black hoodie and a white bandana' and additional patrol cars are dispatched to the location. At one point a male voice reports: 'We have one of the 'Cops' guys has been hit by gunfire; we need a squad here now.' Another male voice then urges 'we need multiple squads, two squads'. A short time later, a man says: 'We've got a 'Cops' cameraman hit, white male, he's not conscious, he's slightly breathing.' Speaking about the injured cameraman, Deputy Police Chief David Baker said: 'We will have more on his condition, as well as any other details on this tomorrow. Suspect killed: The armed raider, said to be wearing a  black hoodie and white bandana was shot in the incident and later pronounced dead by police . 'We have a lot of ground to cover here tonight and officers will continue the investigation throughout the night.' Cops, created by US film and TV director John Langley, was first aired in 1989 and follows police officers and federal agents on patrols as well as on special operations such as vice and narcotics stings. It describes itself as 'one of the first and only true and unscripted reality shows.' 43rd and Dodge Street: The cameraman from the long-running TV show was shot after accompanying officers on a call to Wendy's restaurant (above) The program, which has been filming in Omaha since July, was broadcast on Fox for 25 years before moving to Spike TV last year. In June Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer explained that he wanted Cops to film his department in action to put 'the professionalism of our officers on display for the city and the world to see', according to the World Herald. Langley Productions has so far been unavailable for comment. It is not the first time that Spike TV has been been caught up in controversy. In June, Carlos Enrique Barron, 43, was jailed for 90 days for firing two shots into the air outside his Las Vegas home in an apparent attempt to scare off a TV crew from reality show 'Repo Games' - also produced by Spike TV. The program involves offering a vehicle owner the chance to prevent their car from being repossessed by answering five general knowledge questions correctly - at which point the show pays off their debts.","TV crew accompanies patrol car as it responds to back-up call in Omaha .

"A stonemason has 'repossessed' a headstone worth nearly £10,000 after the bill remained unpaid for more than three years. Self-employed stonemason Andy Manuell, 54, went to the extreme lengths of tearing down the memorial when he was left out of pocket after chasing the family for payment for the ‘star memorial’ in Durrington Cemetery, West Sussex. He was forced to pay debt collectors from his own savings and so has partially removed the 4ft high ornate grave for Francesco and Immacolata Isolda to try and ‘cause a reaction’ to motivate the family to pay up. Extreme lengths: A stonemason has been forced to repossess this ornate gravestone, worth £10,000, after the family refused to pay . Mr Manuell of Worthing, Sussex said: 'I have been forced to pay out of my own savings to try and keep my business afloat. 'This was one of the biggest and most ornate graves I have ever made. '£10,000 is a lot of money to be left out of pocket with when you're a small business. 'It would have been the star memorial in my brochure and it is easily the biggest in the cemetery.

"Burger King has agreed to buy Canadian coffee-and-doughnut chain Tim Hortons to create the world's third-largest quick service restaurant group, with sales of about $23billion. The corporate headquarters of the new company will be in Canada, which may also help Burger King lower its taxes. Such tax inversions have been criticized by President Barack Obama and Congress because they mean a loss of tax revenue for the U.S. government. Scroll down for video . Unfair? Some Burger King customers are finding it hard to swallow that the home of the Whopper will move to Canada, where they would see their taxes lowered . Burger King and Tim Hortons said the chains will continue to be run independently and that Burger King will still operate out of Miami. Investors seemed to welcome the announcement by Burger King late Sunday that it was in talks to buy Tim Hortons. The news pushed shares of both companies up more than 20 percent. However, some Burger King customers are finding it hard to swallow that the home of the Whopper will move. Customers have been voicing their discontent with the 60-year-old hamburger chain because of the implications for its tax bill. By Monday afternoon, Burger King's Facebook page had more than 1,000 mostly negative comments about the deal. Shawn Simpson, who hadn't heard of the talks until approached by a reporter while he was at a Burger King in New York City on Monday afternoon, said he didn't like the idea of the company paying its taxes to another country. 'For them to take their headquarters and move it across the border is a negative for me,' said Simpson, 44, who was ordering a Double Whopper and onion rings. 'It's an American brand.' Customer Gabe Givens wrote on Burger King's Facebook page: 'If you attempt to buy Tim Hortons for the purposes of evading US taxes, I will NEVER step foot in another Burger King again. Don't do it.' A message from Mike Gee carried a similar sentiment. He said: 'Move to Canada to avoid paying taxes and I will never darken the door of a Burger King again. Does corporate greed in this country ever end? Shame!' Zach Bernstein added his disapproving voice to the debate. He wrote: 'I don't patronize corporations that engage in tax inversions, so if you do take that route, count me among the many Americans who will never enter one of your stores again.' A representative for Burger King, Miguel Piedra, said while the headquarters of the new company would be in Canada, Burger King would still continue to be run out of Miami. Piedra also said the comments on Burger King's Facebook page represent a small fraction of the company's more than 7 million followers on the social media site. Big U.S. companies, including pharmaceutical AbbiVie and Valeant Pharmaceuticals, recently have pursued tax inversions to cut their costs. Earlier this month, Walgreen abandoned plans to pursue a tax inversion after negative publicity about the planned move. White House spokesman Josh Earnest wouldn't comment on Burger King's announcement on Monday, but said the president generally believes it's unfair for companies to pursue a tax inversion merely to pay less in taxes. The Obama administration is considering executive steps it could take to de-incentivize inversions. Tax purposes: The move will be a tax inversion, where one company buys another based in another country in order to lower its taxes . Unlike many other companies, Burger King's move has the potential to turn off customers since it's a brand people are so familiar with. It's difficult to gauge whether such fallout would hurt the fast-food chain's business in the U.S. Some analysts say even if some Burger King customers are initially angered by the move, the feelings could quickly fade since there wouldn't be any significant changes in restaurants as a result of the deal. Besides, many Burger King customers who go to the chain for convenience may not care enough about the move to change their eating habits, said Jonathan Maze, editor of Restaurant Finance Monitor, which tracks the industry. 'It's going to irritate people, but basically it's a paper move,' he said. It's not clear exactly how much a combination with Tim Hortons would reduce Burger King's tax costs. A recent report by KPMG found that total tax costs in Canada are 46.4 percent lower than in the United States. The deal will create a new holding company with 18,000 restaurants in 100 countries and about $22 billion in sales. The tie-up could help each Burger King and Tim Hortons chains pose a greater challenge to market leaders such as McDonald's and Starbucks. It also reflects a desire by both companies to expand internationally. Burger King, which has about 14,000 locations, has been striking deals to open more locations in developing markets. The company sees plenty of room for growth internationally, given the more than 35,000 locations McDonald's has around the world. Tim Hortons has more than 4,500 locations, mostly in Canada. Back in the U.S., breakfast and coffee have been hot growth areas in the fast-food industry. Between 2007 and 2012, breakfast grew faster than other segments in the restaurant industry at about 5 per cent a year, according to market researcher Technomic. But it has long remained a weak spot for Burger King. McDonald's led the category with 31 per cent of the market in 2012, while Burger King had just 3 percent to 4 percent, according to Technomic. Burger King's stock surged $5.78, or 21 percent, to $32.89 on Monday, while Tim Hortons' stock also rose 21 percent to $76. 33. It wouldn't be the first time Tim Horton has paired with a U.S. fast-food chain. Tim Hortons was purchased by Wendy's International Inc. in 1995. In 2006 it completed an initial public offering and was spun off as a separate company.","Negative comments left on Burger King's Facebook page about the deal .

"On the shore of Lake Jackson in Manassas, Virginia, stands an imposing villa built by a high-ranking government official, which played a mysterious role during the Cold War as a secret refuge for defecting Russian spies. The luxury mansion called Alvictus is currently on the market for $749,000. It was built in the late 50s by Victor Purse, a well-connected and cunning State Department official who counted among his friends presidents and kings. After moving to Florida in the 1970s, Purse rented his secluded, plush home to the Central Intelligence Service to be used as a safe house where so-called ‘illegals’ from the Soviet Union were tucked away. Scroll down for video . Mystery mansion: This lavish lakefront estate named Alvictus in Manassas, Virginia, housed defecting Russian spies in the 1970s . Dignitaries: The palatial home was built by U.S. Deputy Chief of Protocol Victor Purse (far right), pictured here with Liberia Vice President William R. Tolbert, Chief of Staff of Liberian Armed Forces, General A.R. Harper, and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State William Rountree . Friends in high places: In his capacity as a protocol official, Purse, then 39 years old, befriended both Saudi King Saud (left) and Queen Elizabeth II (right) during official visits to Washington DC in 1957 . VIP guest: Robert F. Kennedy (left), pictured with John F. Kennedy (right) in 1957, stayed at Alvictus on one occasion . The waterfront home at 11625 Purse Drive has three bedrooms and three bathrooms, 4,654 square feet, a swimming pool, an outdoor bar and a large patio for entertainment. The sale is being handled by realtors Dwayne and Maryanne Moyers, who thoroughly researched the property's history. The most impressive part of the high-end home is its shadowy past. Alvitcus is every inch the brainchild of its first owners, Victor Purse, who served as State Department Deputy Chief of Protocol between 1954 and 1957, and his first wife, Alice. The name of the mansion is an acronym combining the first few letters of the Purses’ given names with 'US' tacked on. During his years in the State Department, Purse, who by nature was charismatic, became known for his impressive connections that included foreign dignitaries and heads of state. The protocol official, then in his late 30s, came to know Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip while arranging their departure home after an official visit. He was even invited to stay in Buckingham Palace in England. Fit for a king: Alvictus was originally a small lakeside log cabin called Happy House, but Mr Purse and his wife transformed it into a luxury lakefront retreat suitable for hosting foreign dignitaries . 'P' for perfect: The koi fish pond on the landscaped property in the shape of the letter 'P' High and mighty: The luxury home was the setting for glamorous parties, one of which was attended by  Attorney General and later Senator Bobby Kennedy . Out of sight: Purse, who had connections in the government after his retirement, decided that his home was perfect to be used as a CIA safe house because it was secluded . Decades later, Queen Elizabeth would send Purse a china set as a wedding gift and even embrace him in public during a reception. Purse also became good friends with Saudi Arabia's King Saud, who invited him to go back with him to the Middle East and stay in his palace. The deputy protocol chief’s propensity for rubbing elbows with the high and mighty was irritating to his superior, Protocol Chief Wiley T. Buchanan, who grumbled about his deputy's glamorous friends. The final straw for Buchanan came in 1957, when then-39-year-old Purse, who considered President Dwight Eisenhower a father figure of sorts, was invited to fly from New York City to Washington DC on the presidential plane. After a public confrontation in the airport between Purse and his boss, who was forced to fly commercial, the deputy was ousted from the protocol office and transferred to an administrative position within the State Department. Two years later, Purse and his then-wife, Alice, were on the market for a lakefront home. The couple became interested in Manassas, Virginia, after hearing of a local real estate developer who was charged with murder. Impressive setting: The formal dining room sitting six with a crystal chandelier over the dining table is overlooking Lake Jackson . Plenty of space: The 4,654-square-foot Alvictus features a two-story great room with 18-foot ceilings . Plush setting: The sun room is in the in-law suite accessible through the living room of the great house . Warm and toasty: The massive family room comes with heated blue slate stone floor perfect for cold Virginia winters . The opportunistic Purse learned which properties the realtor, Luther Alpaugh, owned, and chose the best location, which at the time featured a one-room log cabin dubbed Happy House. The Purses went to work expanding the small bungalow and turning it into a lavish mansion with 18-foot ceilings where they could entertain their guests, among them U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy. The couple also added a patio, a pool, observation decks and a fountain with a large water wheel in the middle. After retiring from the State Department in the mid-70s, Mr Purse was living part time in Florida and decided to rent the secluded mansion hidden from view by high fences and neighboring homes to the CIA. Long-time residents of Manassas still remember seeing Purse's shady tenants speaking a foreign language in the local country store. Purse was kept in the dark about much of what was going on at Alvictus while it was being rented out by the U.S. government. But he did reveal to Katherine Peters, who bought the mansion from him in 1983, that he knew the identity of one of the Russian secret agents who called the lakefront estate home for a while. When asked if any other noteworthy house guests Purse stated: ‘Robert Kennedy was out here once. That’s all I can say about it.’ Alvictus changed hands twice since the 80s. It is currently owned by John Rutledge and Jerry Lamp, who had bought the house in 2002 from Larry Lomax, an international antiques dealer to celebrities, congressional members, movie stars, and millionaires.","State Department official Victor Purse turned a log cabin called Happy House in Manassas, Virginia, into luxury mansion Alvictus in 1959 .

"Asif Ghanbari, 19, of Stoke-on-Trent, was sentenced to 32 months in a young offenders' institution after grooming and having regular sex with the schoolgirl . An illegal immigrant who was hired as an interpreter for the British Army after fleeing war-torn Afghanistan groomed a schoolgirl on Facebook and got her pregnant, a court heard. Asif Ghanbari, 19, started a new life in the UK after he was dumped at a service station on the M6 after fleeing to Britain on the back of a lorry in 2008. However, Ghanbari, of Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in a young offenders’ institution today after pleading guilty to sexual activity with a child. Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard how Ghanbari fled the war-torn Helmand Province six years ago and forged a new life after being dumped at Stafford Services on the M6. He set up home in Stoke-on-Trent and began training with the British Army to work as an interpreter for future visits back to Afghanistan. However, in his desperation to find a girlfriend, he posed under a false name of Jack Nelson on Facebook and lured the teenage girl, who was 13 at the time, into meeting him. He took the youngster - who cannot be named - on a string of dates before their relationship blossomed. They started to have sex regularly and by the age of 14, the girl got pregnant and had an abortion. Prosecutor Rupert Jones said: ‘He used the name Jack Nelson. A couple of weeks after making contact he suggested they meet. ‘They met in Hanley Forest Park and he arrived in his car. She told the defendant her age. ‘The defendant arranged to meet her again. He kissed her. Eventually he took her to his home and into his bedroom. ‘They had sexual intercourse without contraception. They had intercourse on a number of other occasions.’ Ghanbari was arrested following the abortion and said in police questioning that he had engaged in consensual sex with the girl about 17 times. Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard how Ghanbari (pictured) fled the war-torn Helmand Province six years ago and forged a new life for himself in the UK after being dumped at Stafford Services on the M6 . Appearing in court today, the former asylum seeker pleaded guilty to an offence of meeting a child following sexual grooming and another of sexual activity with a child. Catherine O’Reilly, mitigating, said: ‘He was reaching out for some comfort, a relationship, some kind of family life. He adopted the name because it was a western name. He wanted a girlfriend. ‘He has made a massive mistake, a massive error of judgement.’ Miss O’Reilly said Ghanbari is intelligent and has been recruited as an Army interpreter. She asked Judge David Fletcher to step back from passing an immediate custodial sentence. But the judge sentenced Ghanbari to 32 months in a young offenders’ institution and placed him on the sex offenders’ register for life. In his desperation to find a girlfriend, Ghanbari posed under a false name of Jack Nelson on Facebook and lured the teenage girl, who was 13 at the time, into meeting him at Hanley Forest Park (pictured) Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard how Ghanbari fled the war-torn Helmand Province six years ago on the back of a lorry and forged a new life after being dumped at Stafford Services on the M6 (pictured) Judge Fletcher said: ‘It could not be said that you were under any misconception about the age of that woman. Her details were on the Facebook site. ‘On the first occasion she made clear to you she was the age she was. She was between 13 and 14. You admitted you had unprotected sexual intercourse with her, you say on 17 occasions.’ A children’s charity today condemned Ghanbari’s actions and highlighted the dangers the internet poses to youngsters. NSPCC official Sandra McNair said: ‘This sad case highlights, once again, the urgent need to educate young people on how to keep safe online, so they can be protected from grooming and exploitation. ‘Peer-to-peer abuse is a growing concern and highlights the vital need to educate young people about healthy and respectful relationships.'","Asif Ghanbari started a new life in the UK after fleeing Afghanistan in 2008 .

"President Barack Obama has ruled out an immediate campaign of air strikes against a militant Islamist terror group that is running roughshod over Iraq, senior administration officials told reporters on Wednesday. When he meets at 3:00 p.m. with congressional leaders from both parties, he will reportedly explain his preference for continued diplomacy and intelligence gathering for Iraq's army over bombing and guided-missile campaigns. Although the president hasn't made a final decision – that will likely come by week's end – plugged-in officials are talking quietly about a 'comprehensive' approach that would include deploying limited numbers of Special Forces and applying pressure to Iraq's Shia government to be more inclusive of the country's Sunni minority. A 5:10 p.m. meeting with Secretary of State John Kerry will follow the president' sit-down with key members of Congress, according to his schedule. Scroll down for videos . They need help: Iraqi Shiite tribal fighters are pushing back against ISIS, but Iraq's leaders are still asking the Obama White House for air strikes to slow them down . Getting closer: As ISIS moves toward Baghdad, its militants are detonating car bombs in the city, like this lethal blast on Wednesday in Baghdad's Shia-dominated Sadr City region . A Sunni al-Qaeda offshoot called the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has swept its insurgency across eastern Syria and northern and central Iraq, capturing cities and executing hundreds if not thousands of Iraqi army soldiers. Obama's military commanders, according to multiple news accounts, have been unable to pinpoint the locations of key ISIS targets, making precision bombing unlikely to succeed. And carpet bombing of the 'shock and awe' brand that Americans saw in the 1989, they say, would inflict mass civilian casualties while doing little to slow down ISIS as it tries to capture Baghdad and depose the government. Instead, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, Obama is leaning toward a strategy that puts U.S. Special Forces on the ground to help the Iraqi army gather intelligence while diplomats pressure Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to be more inclusive of his countrymen on the opposite side of Iraq's political divide. According to Fox News, a deployment of 100 special operators from among the U.S. armed forces is being considered. In advance of Wednesday's White House confab, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he wouldn't support any deployment of military personnel to Iraq to intervene in what amounts to a civil war. 'It's time for the Iraqis to resolve it themselves,' said Reid, adding that 'those who attack President Obama for bringing our troops home from Iraq are wrong and out of step with the American people.' Obama has said he will not put 'boots on the ground' in Iraq but told Congress on Monday that as many as 275 U.S. forces, 'armed for combat,' are being sent to Baghdad to protect American interests as embassy staff and assets are moved to safer places. Sunnis on the march: Al-Qaeda sympathizers in Iraq openly demonstrate in favor of the terror group ISIS as it takes over more and more of northern and central Iraq . While Iraq descended further into chaos, Obama returned to the White House Tuesday night following a fundraising trip to New York City that also included a speech at a gay rights gala . According to the Associated Press, Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said Wednesday that the Iraqi government has asked the U.S. for air strikes against ISIS's militants. But with Iraq in bloody chaos, it may be impossible for U.S. intelligence agencies to confirm the locations of the group's top leaders including Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. ISIS is the same group that came to power with the name Al-Qaeda In Iraq. An ABC News report cites an unnamed Obama administration official saying that if the president chooses to launch air strikes, the result would be a limited campaign of surgical drone strikes similar to U.S. intervention in Yemen and Pakistan. That possibility has The New York Times speculating about the political fallout if Obama announces any kind of offensive. 'The limited scale of any military action may make it easier for Mr. Obama to sell to Congress and the public,' the Times reports.","Administration officials are whispering about plans for Special Forces to gather intelligence on ISIS leaders while the U.S. presses Iraq for a more 'inclusive' government .

"A mission to Mars is something that many have been hoping for ever since the last explorers left the surface of the moon. And now Nasa has stated that they intend to land humans on the red planet in 2035. Chief scientist Dr Ellen Stofan, in a series of talks across the UK, outlined the plans of the agency to undertake such a mission in the next two decades. Scroll down for video of Dr Stofan's talk . Nasa's chief scientist Dr Ellen Stofan has revealed the agency plans to land humans on Mars in the next 20 years. To get there she says there are a number of technological milestones that must be reached, including sending astronauts to an asteroid, to ensure the crew's survival . Nasa’s developments in recent years have revolved around ultimately sending people to Mars. These include the creation of the Space Launch System heavy-lift rocket and the Orion capsule. Both will be components of any future attempt to land humans on the surface of Mars before returning to Earth. ‘To unambiguously settle the questions of whether there was life on Mars it will take scientists down on the surface,’ Dr Stofan said at the Natural History Museum in London. She added that getting humans to Mars is Nasa’s ‘primary mission’ but there is a long way to go before all the technologies are ready – although she did say 2035 was ultimately the target. Prior to the Mars attempt will be a mission to move an asteroid into position between the moon and Earth that will later be visited by astronauts. This is seen as a vital stepping stone for testing the technologies that will eventually make a Mars mission possible. Nasa's Orion capsule will be one of the key components of any future attempt to land on Mars. The capsule will be responsible for launching astronauts into space and ultimately returning them to Earth. It is pictured here at the Operations and Checkout Building at Nasa's Kennedy Space Center. Its first flight will occur in December . And, in a separate talk at the Royal Institution in London according to the Houston Chronicle, Dr Stofan said Mars ‘remains our primary focus’ in the near term. But, she says, it is not an undertaking Nasa plans to attempt alone – it will require cooperation on an international scale with other nations. Dr Stofan also adds that the first mission, which would be a return trip of about three years, will be a precursor to humanity ultimately settling and colonising the surface of Mars. ‘I don't think that first group will necessarily stay there, but we need to think of this as establishing an outpost,’ she said. ‘We want it to be possible for those people to come back if they want to, but it's the beginning of sustained human presence on Mars.’ Dr Stofan, however, as keen to stress the importance of being cautious when undertaking what would arguably be makind’s greatest accomplishment. Other organisations such as the privately funded Mars One have claimed they will land humans on Mars by 2025, but have yet to reveal much research and development that indicates such a goal is achievable. Nasa, meanwhile, is taking the careful approach. ‘We want to make sure we get living astronauts to the surface of Mars,’ Dr Stofan said according to the Guardian. ‘For us, that is a non-negotiable position. There is a lot of work to do, that’s why we need all of the space agencies around the world working together.’ NASA would find an asteroid which is between seven and 10m wide. They would then tow or push it towards Earth so that it ends up in a stable orbit near the moon. In . 2021 astronauts would then use an Orion capsule - a manned spacecraft - . to land on the asteroid and bring back soil and rock samples for . analysis. This asteroid would also, probably in the 2030s, be used as a stop-off point for astronauts on their way to Mars. Exact . details on how Nasa plans to pluck an asteroid out of its trajectory . are not yet known, but the most recent rendering rendering shows it is . captured and held inside what looks like a giant plastic bag. The mission involves astronauts . making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the . next-generation Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. After the Orion and the asteroid are attached, the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object. Once . the Orion docks with the remote-operated asteroid capture device, the . crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the . conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take . photos of and scoop samples from, the video shows. After . the mission is complete, Orion returns to Earth on the same path it . journeyed out on, loops around the moon included, and splashes down in . an ocean – likely the Pacific – 10 days later, as seen in the video.","Nasa's chief scientist Dr Ellen Stofan has outlined their plans for Mars .

"Hillary Clinton has distanced herself from Barack Obama over the situation in Syria - saying she pushed to arm moderate Syrians, but was overruled by the President. Mrs Clinton - a potential presidential candidate for 2016 - made her differences with Mr Obama clear. But, though the suggestion was made, she did not go so far as to say whether different foreign policy could have prevented the rise of jihadist militants now causing chaos in Syria and Iraq. In a TV interview she said: 'We pushed very hard. But as I say in my book, I believe that Harry Truman was right, the buck stops with the president'. Scroll down for video . Not our fault; Clinton said the decision to yank American troops out of Iraq, taken while she was secretary of state, belonged to Iraq itself, not to the U.S. Clinton, who is on the fence about running for president in 2016, fielded questions moderated by CNN's Christiane Amanpour while wearing a Ralph Lauren suit . Mrs Clinton, a former secretary of state, said she joined forces with Pentagon and CIA chiefs to persuade Obama to arm rebels opposing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but that the White House resisted. Speaking on CNN, she said: 'It's very difficult, in retrospect, to say that would have prevented this.' The former secretary of state, senator and first lady has been offering views that differ from Obama's on foreign policy in recent months, including on issues such as Iran's nuclear program and dealings with Russian president Vladimir Putin. However, she stood by the President in another segment of the interviewing, suggesting that Mr Obama bears no responsibility for his decision to pull American troops out of . Iraq at the end of 2011. That decision, which created a power vacuum in the country, has also contributed to the rise of ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) militants. 'In retrospect, that was a mistake by the Iraqi government,' she said. Mrs Clinton was referring to the two governments' failure to . sign a mutual Status of Forces Agreement, a document that would have kept . American servicemen and women in Iraq as a stabilizing force after 2011. Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki reportedly balked on a . U.S. proposal because it would have included legal immunity for American troops . who broke local laws. ISIS has seized American-made tanks and weapons along its push toward Baghdad -- materiel transferred to the Iraqi army before Obama ordered a troop pullout in 2011 . Iraq has descended into chaos in recent weeks, with ISIS seizing cities and presiding over mass executions of Iraqi soldiers. The group aims to institute an Islamic 'caliphate' – a nation that transcends the borders of existing countries – held together by strict Shariah law. The United States has sent warships and aircraft carriers into the Persian Gulf in the last week while Mr Obama decides whether to engage ISIS with airstrikes. The White House said Monday that Mr Obama had sent 275 troops into Baghdad to protect the evacuation of embassy personnel and assets while they are moved far away from the fighting. On Tuesday ISIS reached within 60 miles of Iraq's capital city. Much of their advance has come with the help of American arms, tanks, rockets and other war materiel, seized as Iraqi army regulars and reserves fled. Pushback: Iraqi Shiite volunteers are now fighting against jihadi militants near Baghdad, hoping to stop ISIS from capturing more of their country . The quick march: ISIS has already captured the red-shaded areas in this map of Iraq and surrounding countries . Mrs Clinton entered the stage for the event, moderated by CNN's . Christiane Amanpour, to wild applause and an extended . ovation. Commenting on Monday's capture of Abu Khattalah, an accused . ringleader of the 2012 attack on America's diplomatic station in . Benghazi, Libya, she said she was 'very pleased.' 'This is another indication ... that the United States has . an unwavering commitment to bring to justice those who are responsible for . attacks on Americans,' Mrs Clinton said. And commenting on the nearly two years that have passed, in . which Khattalah openly operated in Libya and gave media interviews while . wipping strawberry frappes in cafes, she insisted that no one in the federal . government slow-walked the Benghazi investigation. 'It took more than ten years to being Osama Bin Laden to . Justice,' Mrs Clinton said. Mrs Clinton gave prominent mention to a State Department . Accountability Review Board report which seemed to clear her of wrongdoing . related to the Benghazi facilities' lack of security on the eleventh . anniversary of the first 9/11 terror attacks. That investigation, however, has come under fire for failing . to interview Mrs Clinton. She said she feels the pain of the mothers and family . members of the four Americans who died in the Benghazi conflagration, caused by . the Islamist terror group Ansar al-Shariah. 'I can see why she and others are inconsolable,' Mrs Clinton . said. But 'we need to be in dangerous places ... We're doing the . best we can to find out what happened. There's a lot we don’t know'. 'Now that we have Khattalah in custody, hopefully we will . learn more from his perspective.' The U.S. government, she assured viewers, wants to know . 'what the motivations of the leaders, of the attackers, happened to be.' Mrs Clinton has been widely criticized for claiming in the early . days after the attack that a spontaneous mob angered by an anti-Islam video . attacked the Benghazi compound, and not a premeditated terrorist group.

"The Sunni extremists running roughshod across Iraq could produce 'a thousand' global terrorists like Osama bin Laden bent on widespread death and destruction, Iraq's ambassador to the United States warned on Monday. Lukman Faily said that if the United States and other nations focus too much on Iraq's internal politics and ignore the 'immediate threat' of a terrorist movement that's gathering steam, the results will be catastrophic. 'This is a global tumor in Iraq taking place now and in Syria,' he said, referring to the Sunni militant group calling itself the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). 'We've seen it before.' The White House has scolded Nouri al-Maliki's government in Baghdad for provoking ISIS by alienating the country's Sunni minority. Barack Obama said on Friday that U.S. military intervention would be conditioned on reconciliation efforts from Maliki's Shia majority. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Lukman Faily, the Iraqi ambassador to the United States, warned CNN's Christiane Amanpour that 'a thousand' Osama bin Ladens could emerge from among the Sunni extremists pushing to take over Baghdad . Pushing back: Iraqi Shiite tribesmen are joining state-run security forces in the fight against Jihadist militants who have taken over several northern Iraqi cities; Iraq's US ambassador says his country needs America's help to prevent 'a thousand' Bin Ladens from turning the globe into a terrorist shooting gallery . 'Any action that we may take to provide assistance to Iraqi security forces has to be joined by a serious and sincere effort by Iraq’s leaders to set aside sectarian differences, to promote stability, and account for the legitimate interests of all of Iraq’s communities,' Obama said in public remarks. 'So this should be a wake-up call.  Iraq’s leaders have to demonstrate a willingness to make hard decisions and compromises on behalf of the Iraqi people in order to bring the country together.' But Faily suggested during an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour that Obama is naively fiddling while Baghdad burns. 'These are all ""nice to have"" discussions,' he said, but 'what we have in Iraq now, to -- is an immediate threat.' 'But do you not feel this is an immediate threat?' Amanpour interrupted, 'that practically half the country feels disenfranchised? The Sunnis?' 'We're not saying we're not happy to [have a] discussion,' he responded. 'We want to have that discussion. But we're saying conditioning that discussion is not wise. Making clear that we all stand together against a threat in global terrorism is the question.' 'Let me give you an example. What you have in Afghanistan, with one Bin Laden – you will have a thousand of them.' 'No POWs,' he warned. 'Nothing, none of that. No rules of engagement but destruction.' 'That's the situation in Iraq.' Obama told Congress on Monday that he is sending 275 armed military men and women into Baghdad to protect American embassy personnel and assets as they are moved elsewhere in Iraq and to Jordan. They will be 'armed for combat,' the White House said, while insisting that the ground troops won't be the first drop in an ocean of military entanglements of the sort that Obama campaigned against in 2008 and 2012. An administration official also said Monday that the president is considering the deployment of a small contingent of Special Forces to Iraq, specifically to help the al-Maliki government slow the advance of ISIS. Obama is also mulling unilateral air strikes to hamper ISIS, but administration sources told MailOnline on Tuesday that the primary objection to that strategy is political, not tactical. The National Security Staff, one source said, is concerned that forcing ISIS off the battlefield now that neighboring Iran has sent 2,000 of its elite Quds forces to stabilize the region could effectively clear the way for Iran to seize oil fields and other lands in eastern Iraq. Amanpour pushed back against Faily, arguing that the more 'immediate threat' to Iraq was political inequality enforced by Shiites against Sunnis . ISIS aims to establish a caliphate -- an Islamic state that transcends national borders -- in areas of Syria and Iraq, and it has captured at least nine cities in the two countries . 'A thousand of them': Faily says the late Osama bin Laden (pictured), who masterminded al-Qaeda's 9/11 terror attacks in the United States, could just be the beginning is ISIS is allowed to press forward . Obama is stuck between a rock and a hard place, needing to keep a U.S.-friendly government in place in Baghdad while also avoiding a newly strengthened and further leveraged Iran at a time when that Islamic republic is moving toward nuclear weapons capability. Faily said Monday that whether or not the White House decides on a path of limited cooperation with Tehran, Iraq needs help urgently. 'We have been saying that we need to strengthen our army with having fighter planes, Apache helicopters and others. ... The administration now understands that urgency.' he said. They have been willing to say, ""We are willing to help."" What we are saying is we cannot wait until tomorrow. A decision has to be made. It should have been made yesterday. 'From our perspective,' Faily said, 'the urgency of the ground are giving us less options and more radical options.'","Lukan Faily said Monday that while Obama frets about Iraq's internal politics, ISIS is gathering strength .

"A surgery addict who was left disabled and disfigured after almost 100 unregulated cosmetic procedures now wants to speak out about the dangers facing unsuspecting women desperate for a quick fix. Monique Allen, who has had more than 200 hundred plastic surgeries, became obsessed with pumping liquid plastic into her body and estimates she has injected almost 12 litres during 75 backstreet ops.

Silicon fan: The retired government worker estimates she has had up to 12 litres of dangerous silicon pumped into her body since she was in her early twenties . The retired government worker said: 'I went in at the deep end with cosmetic surgery and I've ruined the natural good looks I had - I wish I had never done it. 'I've probably had around 200 operations over the years, many of which I can't remember. 'More and more people are dying from illegal silicon injections - many of them young women. I want them to look at me and see the dangers. 'Now I struggle to walk and am registered disabled. I ignored the risks and now I have to live with the results.

Numerous operations: Over the years Monique, 58, has had a staggering 23 nose jobs and nine breast augmentations . Speaking out: After decades of reckless operations Monique wants to speak out about the dangers facing unsuspecting women desperate for a quick fix . Back in the day: Monique at 28 years old after her gender reassignment in 1982 in Los Angeles, California and (R) aged 37 in 1992 . Transgender Monique had gender reassignment surgery aged 22 and soon after achieved the D-cup breasts she desired through surgery. She next turned her sights on her nose, which has been an obsession over the years. But after turning to silicon to enhance her curves, Monique became hooked and began seeking out treatment with unregulated doctors. Twice-married Monique, who is now single, said: 'In my twenties and thirties as soon as I had a couple of hundred dollars I would head to Tijuana to have illegal silicon injections. 'The doctor would numb you then attach a funnel to whichever part of your body you wanted, then screw a vial of silicon on and pump it in. 'I was so reckless but I was obsessed with having more.

Splashing the cash: She says that when she had a couple of hundred dollars she would head to Tijuana to have illegal silicon injections . 'Once I saw a dark cloud appear under the skin where the silicon was going in - but even that didn't phase me'. Over the years Monique also had treatment from accredited celebrity doctors including Liberace's plastic surgeon's Dr Jack Startz. And she was once operated on by infamous doctor John Reginald Brown aka Butcher Brown who was later jailed for manslaughter after one of his patients bled to death. She said: 'I was completely addicted and unwilling to think of the risks. My family begged me to stop but all I cared about was having more. 'I've destroyed the good looks I had when I was younger. Even now I would like anther nose job but doctors turn me away, but I understand why. 'I've come to the realisation that I have a problem and I'm taking steps to address it.'

Monique, who holds the record for the longest serving transgender state employee in US history, said: 'I love to party and everyone knows who I am. I write and perform my own songs at clubs in Los Angeles and have a huge fan base. 'People know me as Glamorous Monique all over the world.' Over the last few years Monique has spent more than £100,000 having silicon removed from her legs, bottom, cheeks and chin. She said: 'Silicon was never meant to be put in the body in such large doses as is common now. 'I've heard of ""pumping parties"" where people go to have vast amounts of silicon injected into their bodies. 'I want young women to look at me before they think about getting unnecessary and dangerous cosmetic work done.

"CNN staff have been accused of making light of the deadly Ebola outbreak by posing for a photo while larking around with two men dressed in Hazmat suits. Twitter users accused the three New Day anchors of mocking the Ebola crisis after CNN senior producer John Griffin posted the picture on social media. In the photo, Chris Cuomo, Michaela Pereira and Alisyn Camerota pretend to be scared, with exaggerated shocked expressions, while two men in protective gear stand over them. New Day hosts Chris Cuomo, Michaela Pereira, and Alisyn Camerota are shown pretending to be scared, with exaggerated shocked expressions, while two men in protective gear stand over them in the offending photo . The photograph appeared on Griffin's Twitter account yesterday morning and it was deleted just over an hour later. But not before Inside Cable News picked up on it and shared the image online. One Twitter user accused Griffin of acting in 'poor taste', before adding, 'pretty sad statement from a news ""leader""'. Another commentator accused CNN of turning issues into 'CSI BS'. According to the latest statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), the worst-ever Ebola epidemic has already claimed nearly 4,500 lives. The vast majority of the fatalities have been in West Africa, but America has been on high alert since Ebola claimed its first victim on U.S. soil, when Thomas Duncan succumbed to the deadly disease on October 8. Twitter users accused the anchors of mocking the issue after CNN producer John Griffin posted the photo . Some Twitter commentators felt that the CNN news anchors were making light of the deadly Ebola outbreak . Two nurses who were treating Mr Duncan also contracted the disease. But both Nina Pham and Amber Vinson are thought to be in stable condition after treatment for the deadly virus. The distinctive full-body Hazmat (hazardous materials and items) suits with their protective masks have become a symbol of the epidemic, and have been seen on flights, at hospitals and anywhere an Ebola scare has erupted. Although the virus has been contained in the United States, authorities have been making efforts to control the growing sense of panic among Americans. The distinctive full body Hazmat  suits with their protective masks have become a symbol of the epidemic . In New York, firefighters have been banned from using the word 'Ebola' on their radios in because it could trigger panic in the city. A New York Fire Department  memo instructs all personnel to use vaguer terms when referring to the deadly virus. Instead, they should use the code letters 'F/T', as in Fever/Travel, over the radio to indicate a 911 caller has a fever and a history of travel to West Africa. 'Just like you can’t say bomb on an airplane, we can’t say ""Ebola"", a source told the New York Post. 'Back in the ’80s and ’90s, taking universal precautions meant someone has AIDS. And we weren’t allowed to say AIDS either.'","Anchors feigned fear in a posed shot with men in Hazmat suits .

"Warning: Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne has been told he could face having to increase tax and impose more cuts to meet pledges to cut the deficit . The era of austerity could last until 2018 and VAT may have to rise to as high as 25 per cent to help plug the hole in the public finances, the Chancellor was warned last night. Economists said that if George Osborne wants to meet his pledge to cut the deficit, he could be forced to announce dramatic tax increases, or impose further cuts. The influential Institute for Fiscal Studies said the continued sluggishness of the economy means the current squeeze on public spending may have to last until 2018. And it said the Chancellor will be forced to announce even more bad news for taxpayers if he is to meet his debt and deficit targets. Under an even more pessimistic scenario, he would be forced to raise an extra £23billion by 2015/16, which he would have to fund by either imposing further cuts or putting up taxes. If he decides to put up taxes, the amount needed would be the equivalent of putting up VAT from the current 20 per cent to 25 per cent, the report says. The grim prospects are contained in new assessment by the IFS ahead of Mr Osborne’s Autumn statement on December 5. It concludes that if the economy fails to grow as projected, then the squeeze on public spending would have to be extended and will have lasted for an unprecedented eight years. Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS, said: ‘Since the budget the outlook for the UK economy has deteriorated and government receipts [taxes] have disappointed by even more than this year’s weak growth would normally suggest. ‘In that case the planned era of austerity could run for eight years, from 2010-11 to 2017-2018.’ The IFS’s predictions will not make happy reading for ministers hoping that the return of Britain to growth in the third quarter of this year would kickstart the Conservatives into office at the end of the current parliament. Even if the economy does improve the . Chancellor may be forced to announce that he has to abandon a crucial . fiscal target – one of the keystones of the Coalition policy. Osborne promised the country that by the time this parliament is over in 2015/16 the overall levels of debt – the accumulation of years  of borrowing – would be on a downward path. It now looks as if that may be impossible in the face of falling tax receipts and rising welfare payments. The IFS estimates that if current trends continue, borrowing in the current financial year will hit £133billion – £13billion higher than forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility for the March budget. Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS, says austerity measures could run for eight years in total taking it to 2018 . The IFS does offer the Chancellor a glimmer of hope. It says that under an ‘optimistic’ scenario no further cuts would be required to meet his budget goals. But even in this case he would need to press ahead with a further £8billion of cuts in the welfare budget, before the end of this Parliament, to keep the public finances on an even keel. Much will depend on the state of the economy. After a run of bad surveys there are concerns that the growth may have slipped back into negative territory in the final months of this year after the one per cent bounce in the three months to the end of September. The IFS says that debt is on course to rise as a share of the nation’s total output. This would almost certainly mean that his promise to start bringing debt down as a proportion of UK output by 2016 would be missed. Forecasts by the International Monetary Fund show that debt will be still be rising beyond the current parliament, reaching 96 per cent of gross domestic product in 2016 . Defence giant BAE has confirmed it is thinking of closing one of its three major shipyards in a move that could threaten more than 1,000 jobs. It is believed Portsmouth is most at risk. BAE, which launched a review of its maritime operations earlier this year, has two yards in Glasgow, at Govan and Scotstoun. A decision is expected by the end of the year.","Institute for Fiscal Studies delivers alarming assessment of the Chancellor's economic plan .

"Carlo Dellaverson, 30, allegedly made a sex tape of his former girlfriend without her knowing . An NBC producer was charged today after he allegedly made a sex tape with his unsuspecting girlfriend and then posted the video on a porn website. Carlo Dellaverson, 30, who is an NBC News digital producer, allegedly filmed the couple having sex on Valentine's Day on a hidden camera in their shared New York City apartment. He then later posted the clip of his girlfriend on XTube, a police source told the New York Post. The 30-year-old's deception was only discovered when his girlfriend found the sex tape on September 4 on his computer. She promptly moved out of the apartment after ending their relationship. The woman, who is not identified, emailed Dellaverson to ask why he would have done this and he reportedly admitted that he had put the tape online, police told the Post. The 29-year-old victim filed a police report and her ex was charged today with disseminating unlawful surveillance and harassment. Dellaverson, originally from Hastings-on-Hudson, is the son of a former top boss at the New York transit authority, Gary Dellaverson. MailOnline was awaiting a comment today from NBC. The 30-year-old was a news editor for Rock Center with Brian Williams but it is unclear if he remains in this role. In 2012, the University of Richmond graduate featured in a house-hunting profile piece with The New York Times in which he described moving from 'three frat-pad apartments with three guys' to owning his $425,000 bachelor pad in Greenwich Village. The studio has good flow and a separate sleeping area, and was a short subway ride to work. He lived his parents to save money for the apartment. He bragged that they didn't charge him rent and his mom would do his laundry and cook him dinner. Calls to Dellaverson went unanswered today.

"Hillary Clinton suggested Tuesday that President Barack . Obama bears no responsibility for his decision to pull American troops out of . Iraq at the end of 2011, a decision that created a power vacuum now filled by a . vicious Islamist terror group. 'In retrospect, that was a mistake by the Iraqi government,' she said during a town hall on CNN. Clinton was referring to the two governments' failure to . sign a mutual Status of Forces Agreement, a document that would have kept . American servicemen and women in Iraq as a stabilizing force after 2011. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki reportedly balked on a . U.S. proposal because it would have included legal immunity for American troops . who broke local laws. Scroll down for video . Not our fault; Clinton said the decision to yank American troops out of Iraq, taken while she was secretary of state, belonged to Iraq itself, not to the U.S. Clinton, who is on the fence about running for president in 2016, fielded questions moderated by CNN's Christiane Amanpour while wearing a Ralph Lauren suit . ISIS has seized American-made tanks and weapons along its push toward Baghdad -- materiel transferred to the Iraqi army before Obama ordered a troop pullout in 2011 . Iraq has descended into chaos in recent weeks, with an al-Qaeda-related Islamist terror group calling itself the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) seizing cities and presiding over mass executions of Iraqi soldiers. The group, formerly called Al-Qaeda in Iraq, aims to institute an Islamic 'caliphate' – a nation that transcends the borders of existing countries – held together by strict Shariah law. The United States has sent warships and aircraft carriers into the Persian Gulf in the last week while Obama decides whether to engage ISIS with airstrikes. The White House said Monday that Obama had sent 275 troops into Baghdad to protect the evacuation of embassy personnel and assets while they are moved far away from the fighting. On Tuesday ISIS reached within 60 miles of Iraq's capital city. Much of their advance has come with the help of American arms, tanks, rockets and other war materiel, seized as Iraqi army regulars and reserves fled. Clinton left the Obama administration in early 2013, but . spoke like a policymaker who is still in charge of American foreign policy during Tuesday's live event. The maybe-presidential-candidate assured her audience of . nearly 200 hand-picked people at the Newseum in Washington, D.C. that 'we are . certainly not putting American soldiers at risk. No boots on the ground.' Clinton entered the stage for the event, moderated by CNN's . Christiane Amanpour, to wild applause, hoots and hollers and an extended . ovation. She quickly acknowledged the carnival-like atomsphere of . her cable-TV coming out event, boasting that her friends in the Middle East . were having a 'watch party.' Commenting on Monday's capture of Abu Khattalah, an accused . ringleader of the September 11, 2012 attack on America's diplomatic station in . Benghazi, Libya, she said she was 'very pleased.' 'This is another indication ... that the United States has . an unwavering commitment to bring to justice those who are responsible for . attacks on Americans,' Clinton said. And commenting on the nearly two years that have passed, in . which Khattalah openly operated in Libya and gave media interviews while . wipping strawberry frappes in cafes, she insisted that no one in the federal . government slow-walked the Benghazi investigation. 'It took more than ten years to being Osama Bin Laden to . Justice,' Clinton said. Pushback: Iraqi Shiite volunteers are now fighting against jihadi militants near Baghdad, hoping to stop ISIS from capturing more of their country . The quick march: ISIS has already captured the red-shaded areas in this map of Iraq and surrounding countries . Clinton gave prominent mention to a State Department . Accountability Review Board report which seemed to clear her of wrongdoing . related to the Benghazi facilities' lack of security on the eleventh . anniversary of the first 9/11 terror attacks. That investigation, however, has come under fire for failing . to interview Clinton. She said she feels the pain of the mothers and family . members of the four Americans who died in the Benghazi conflagration, caused by . the Islamist terror group Ansar al-Shariah. 'I can see why she and others are inconsolable,' Clinton . said. But 'we need to be in dangerous places ... We're doing the . best we can to find out what happened.' 'There's a lot we don’t know,' she said. 'Now that we have Khattalah in custody, hopefully we will . learn more from his perspective.' The U.S. government, she assured viewers, wants to know . 'what the motivations of the leaders, of the attackers, happened to be.' Clinton has been widely criticized for claiming in the early . days after the attack that a spontaneous mob angered by an anti-Islam video . attacked the Benghazi compound, and not a premeditated terrorist group. No one asked her about that awkward chapter.","During a CNN broadcast, former Sec. of State Hillary Clinton said President Obama isn't to blame for the lack of a US military presence in Iraq .

"An alleged 'maternity hotel' in Southern California where pregnant women from China stayed so they could give birth there and make their babies American citizens in the process has been closed. Neighbors of the property in the quiet neighborhood of Chino Hills, set up a protest group and repeatedly complained that women - at one point up to 30 - were being put up in the home in a 'birth tourism' scheme, according to the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin. Officials filed a restraining order on the grounds that the business was in violation of city building codes and it has since been vacated. 'Maternity hotel': This gated property in Chino Hills, California, was allegedly operating as a hotel where Chinese women could give birth and earn their babies American citizenship . 'To the best of our knowledge, it is unoccupied right now,' Chino Hills city spokeswoman Denise Cattern told the newspaper. 'This is the first step in a legal process that we feel will permanently shut down the home as a hotel,' Chino Hills Mayor Peter Rogers said. 'From the moment the city had confirmation this home was being occupied as a hotel, it was just a matter of following the code enforcement process to its ultimate conclusion. We are hopeful this matter will be legally concluding soon.' So called 'maternity hotels' don't . violate federal law - a woman is permitted to travel to the U.S. on a . tourist visa and give birth. If a baby is born in the U.S it is . automatically granted citizenship, they can then live in the country . as an adult and apply for a full green card. Citizenship: Mothers from China who want to earn their children American citizenship are increasingly taking part in 'birth tourism' where they fly to the U.S. to have their babies on American soil . Maternity hotel packages are priced at up to $20,000. The mother usually stays in the U.S. for around a month after the baby is born. City laws tend to be the way neighbors get such properties closed down. In this case building work was allegedly . carried out on the home without a permit and their was no license to . operate it as a hotel. Court documents listed the owner of the Chino Hills property as Los Angeles Hermas Inc under the names Hai Yong Wu and Yi Wang. Protest: Residents in Chino Hills demonstrated against the alleged maternity hotel last month . Residents from surrounding properties took part in a 'Not in Chino Hills' protest against the business last month. Dozens of protesters held up placards saying 'No More Anchor Babies'. Wu and Wang are expected in court again on January 17. It is alleged that the pair turned the six bedroom house into a 17-bedroom hotel with monogrammed towels and bathrobe, according to the report. There have been several similar cases in the area in the past few years. Local residents previously told the Press Enterprise why they were so opposed to the property. Rossana Mitchell told the Press: 'Apparently this is an epidemic happening nationwide. We're outraged, we think it is unethical and un-american.

On Monday, Mr Boyd's mother Lori was waiting beside her son's car with a flat tire in front of her home when McClain drove up, according to the Austin-American Statesman. The mother called the police but as Lori Boyd tried to tell the operator the license number of the vehicle, McClain allegedly put the car in reverse and slammed on the gas pedal, striking her. McClain then drove forward and ran over the right side of her body, including her foot and arm. Seconds after leaving his mother in the driveway, she texted Mr Boyd, saying: 'How's life LOL.' He was not home at the time, and didn't know what the text was about until he heard from his mother's boyfriend, who said that she had been mother had been run over by McClain. It was the latest in a string of . trouble that Mr Boyd had been experiencing with his jilted girlfriend since their . break-up. McClain was also charged with stalking after cops said she called Mr Boyd 750 times in one day. KXAN-TV reported that on November 11, McClain called Mr Boyd and threatened to drive her car into his living room, and implied that she was watching him. He called the police, but McClain was not in the area. Three days later, as Mr Boyd was driving, she texted him, asking: 'How's your car?' Reaching out: McClain was also charged with stalking after cops said she called Mr Boyd 750 times in one day and sent him threatening text messages . He stopped to inspect the vehicle and found that someone had dumped sugar in his gas tank. Mr Boyd said he would change his phone number, but she would somehow find out what he had changed it to and the texts would continue. Lori Boyd was hospitalized with broken bones, including her right clavicle, wrist, ankle and ribs, and had the skin scraped off the right side of her body. KXAN reported that a magistrate ordered McClain to wear an ankle monitoring bracelet and adhere to a 10pm curfew. She must also stay at least 200 yards away from Mr Boyd at all times.

"From formal state dinners to a visit to the royal stables, the Queen has clearly enjoyed entertaining President Michael D. Higgins of Ireland and his wife Sabina. But while the convivial state visit might over, the beaming monarch had a consolation prize to look forward to - a runner at Newbury this afternoon. After bidding the Irish president goodbye, the Queen travelled to the Newbury racecourse in Berkshire, to see her horse Enliven, a bay filly, ran in the Coln Valley Stud Bridget Maiden Fillies Stakes. Not amused: The Queen looked less than impressed after Enliven failed to come up with the goods at Newbury . Cross: Enliven's less than stellar seventh place performance failed to meet with royal approval . Unfortunately for the Queen, the filly didn't quite live up to her regal owner, managing a less-than-impressive seventh place finish - well behind the eventual winner, Evita Peron. Perhaps the filly was exhausted after the excitement of getting a pat from President Higgins during his visit to the Kingsclere Park House Stables in Berkshire yesterday. After meeting Enliven and her stablemate Micras, President Higgins was shown the stable's facilities and met animals belonging to other notable owners - including former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. The Queen's glum countenance following Enliven's poor finish was in stark contrast to the smiles of this morning as she said a warm goodbye to the Irish president ahead of his flight back to Dublin. Deep in conversation: The Queen chats with trainer Andrew Balding, brother of Clare, before the race . Good luck! The Queen chats to jockey David Probert ahead of the Coln Valley Stud Bridget Maiden Fillies' Stakes . Enjoying herself: Despite his failure to win the race, the Queen appeared to enjoy her chat with Probert . Meet and greet: Enliven (right) was among the horses to be introduced to racing fan President Higgins . Warm: The Queen clearly enjoyed the visit from the racing mad Irish President Michael D. Higgins . Pleased: The Queen bid the Irish President a fond farewell following a hugely successful state visit . Resplendent in an elegant oxblood coat, which she also wore for her trip to the races, the monarch was on top form as she and the Duke of Edinburgh gave the presidential couple a suitably regal send off. Looking equally lovely was Ireland's First Lady Sabina Higgins, who was elegant in a soft oatmeal wool coat and a delicate pale pink fascinator. President Higgins also seemed to have enjoyed the trip, beaming broadly as he shook hands with the monarch before being whisked off to the airport. The Queen's career as a racehorse owner spans more than 60 years and began with the handful she inherited on the death of her father George VI. Elegant: The Queen appeared equally enamoured of Sabina Higgins, the chic Irish First Lady . All smiles: The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh chuckle at a quip made by Ireland's President Higgins . Shared interests: The Queen and President Higgins share a love of horse racing . Like her father and grandfather before her, the Queen's horses race in purple and scarlet silks enlivened with gold braiding. During her long association with racing, the Queen has triumphed in more than 1600 races and has won every one of the British Classics, with the exception of the Epsom Derby. Last year, Estimate, a filly owned by the Queen, romped home to take the prestigious Gold Cup at Royal Ascot - much to the delight of the monarch. Despite her love of racing, the Queen no longer rides her mettlesome thoroughbreds herself, instead pottering around the Windsor Great Park on the back of her faithful Fell pony, Carltonlima Emma. On their way: The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh and the Irish presidential couple exchange farewells . Ready to go: The Queen lent President Higgins her Rolls Royce for the journey to the airport .

"Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and GOP vice presidential candidate, blasted President Barack Obama on Saturday and demanded his removal from office. The tea party speaking-circuit darling said at the Western Conservative Summit in Denver, Colorado that talk of impeachment 'has got him nervous.' Condemning the White House's response to a swarm of illegal immigrants cascading across the U.S.-Mexico border, she accused Obama of 'not . defending [America's] borders and called it a 'dereliction of duty, violating the oath of office.' 'If that's not impeachable, then nothing is,' she said to generous applause. 'And if he's not . impeachable, no one is.'

Mini-vacay: Obama and his family took the Marine One helicopter to Camp David for a weekend retreat on Friday . Mama grizzly: Artist Benjamin Hummel produced cartoon caricatures as official gifts for speakers, including Palin, at the Western Conservative Summit in Denver . 'Unaccompanied Alien Children': The Obama administration is straining under the weight of tens of thousands of uninvited border crossers, most of them children traveling without adults. The White House has asked Congress for $3.7 billion in new funding to handle the humanitarian crisis, but has drawn the ire of Republicans by doing little to suggest a plan to secure the border . 'No . serious person can deny that team Obama has abused and violated the . public trust and the Constitution,' Palin charged. 'The list of abuses, it goes on . and on.' In addition to immigration – 'amnesty' in conservative parlance – she rattled off a list of scandals including the mistreatment of veterans by VA health centers; a cover-up about the 2012 terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya; Justice Department spying on journalists, the IRS's alleged pattern of targeting conservative nonprofits for undue scrutiny; and the president's unilateral changes to his medical insurance overhaul law. Obama, she said, is 'spinning from one scandal to another scandal. He has vertigo.' 'Even when crystal clear evidence stares him in the face, he lies and says there's no corruption at all.' Palin showed her comfort with hyperbole, comparing his administration to an organized crime syndicate whose capo is insulated from responsibility by staying at arm's length from murder and mayhem. Obama, she said, can't 'feign ignorance of all . of this, any more than a mob boss can claim innocence because, well, ""he . didn't personally do the hit."" The buck stops with the guy at the top.' Saying Obama has fashioned himself more as 'a ruler, not a president,' she brought some to their feet by declaring that American colonists 'had a revolution in 1776 because we don't do kings.' And playing to an event sponsored by the evangelical Colorado Christian University, she charged that 'it's an affront to God to let this go on, because He gave us [our] freedoms..' 'We're not going to let someone, a person, a party, take them . from us,' she said. 'We're not going to dethrone God and substitute Him with someone . who wants to play God.'

Throughout, she referred back to the need for conservatives to have 'the guts to talk about impeachment.' And time and again she pushed the immigration hot-button. 'The Obama doctrine,' she said, 'is ""break the law, get a reward."" His incentives are invitations, and it's gonna get worse.' Palin also alleged that the growing problem on America's southwest border isn't limited to the tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors who have shown up and taxed federal government programs to their breaking point. 'It's not just the innocent children, she said. 'Open borders? Nothing is there to sift out the bad guys. The gang-bangers and terrorists, they will be mixed in there and we're offering to take care of them.' 'I think it's insane.' 'We're offering to strengthen them and we're going to be overrun,' she predicted. 'If Obama won't obey the law and secure the borders, then it's not immigration.

"Read MARTIN SAMUEL's expert view on what the future holds for Hatem Ben Arfa . French Ligue 1 side Nice want to sign Hatem Ben Arfa from Newcastle. Hull City are cutting short the France international's loan and he is surplus to requirements at St James' Park. Greek champions Olympiakos have also shown an interest in the 27-year-old. Ben Arfa joined Hull on a season-long loan after being criticised for a lack of professionalism by Newcastle boss Alan Pardew. French international Hatem Ben Arfa has emerged as a target for Ligue 1 side Nice . The 27-year-old's loan spell is being cut short by Hull having played just nine games for the club . The Frenchman played just nine games for Hull and Bruce told BBC last week: 'Sometimes transfers don't work, especially with a loan deal. 'I'm disappointed. We brought him in on a wave of publicity and there has been no fallout or slanging match. 'His views of the game are different to mine. At any club you need to have a certain work ethic to get in the team, that's the frustrating thing. Ben Arfa scored 14 goals in 86 appearances for Newcastle but is surplus to requirements at St James' Park . 'I hope Hatem takes in what I've had to say to him because his talent is there for all to see. But talent without hard work means you won't live up to your potential,"" said Bruce. 'To play for me you have to know you are playing for the team. To be a great you have to be a team player.'

"A British citizen whose family believe he is being tortured by American secret agents has suddenly had all his rights as a UK national removed by the Home Secretary. Mahdi Hashi – who MI5 once tried to recruit as a spy – has been deprived of his British passport, denied access to consular assistance and may never return to Britain. He is thought to be being held in an African prison. Mohamed and Kaltun Hashi, the parents of the 23-year-old care worker from Camden, North London, became concerned for his safety after being tipped off that in the summer he had been taken to a prison in the African state of Djibouti while visiting neighbouring Somalia. Prisoner: Mahdi Hashi (pictured left) is believed to be held at a US camp in Djibouti after he had his rights as a UK national removed by the Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured left) The information was passed on by another prisoner who said Mr Hashi claimed he had been ‘mistreated’ and was being interrogated by men working for America. The Mail on Sunday has established that while Mr Hashi was out of Britain, Home Secretary Theresa May used a little-known power – which does not require a court order – to deprive him of all his rights as a British national. It can also be revealed that Mrs May has issued at least another nine orders against British nationals. The majority have been served on Muslim men, although the most public case is that of Russian spy Anna Chapman, who had been married to a UK national. Mr Hashi and his family moved to the UK from Somalia when he was five. In late 2009 he returned to the capital Mogadishu where he had met his wife, whom he married last year and with whom he has a child. His parents found out about his detention only after the other prisoner had been released and returned to Somalia where he made contact with Mr Hashi’s relatives. In a desperate attempt to find Mr Hashi, his mother-in-law travelled from Mogadishu to Djibouti, but despite repeated requests prison staff refused to say if he was there. The family has also approached the Djibouti and US authorities but have been given no information about Mr Hashi. The deprivation of citizenship order signed by Mrs May says Mr Hashi has lost his rights to live in the UK because of the ‘public good’. The Americans have built a large base to combat terrorist groups across the continent at Camp Lemmonier in Djibouti . A letter adds: ‘The Security Service assess that you have been involved in Islamicist extremism and present a risk to the national security of the United Kingdom due to your extremist activities.’ Mr Hashi has not been told of  what he is accused, nor is it clear whether he knows he is no longer a British citizen. Human rights lawyers said he may be the victim of a new Government policy in which Britain is denying British nationals citizenship when they find themselves in serious trouble in foreign countries. Geoffrey Robertson, QC, prominent human rights barrister, said: ‘The increase in orders under this Government of depriving British people of their citizenship on non-conducive grounds is a matter of concern because it is always very difficult to challenge fairly. It means people are being deprived of their rights as a British citizen on the say-so of security officials who can’t be challenged in court.’ Cageprisoners, the human rights group that campaigns against secret detentions, believes Mr Hashi may  be the victim of an American rendition programme in which suspects are unlawfully taken to third-party states where they are illegally detained and tortured. The order issued by Mrs May can be used only against a UK national who has dual citizenship. It is not clear if Mr Hashi can still claim Somali nationality because he left Somalia for the UK when he was so young. In 2009, Mr Hashi complained to his MP Frank Dobson (pictured) Human rights group are concerned that he may now be held at Camp Lemmonier in Djibouti where the Americans have built a large base to combat terrorist groups across the continent. It is also where many of the US drone attacks in Africa are co-ordinated. But in a legal Catch 22 the US Ambassador in London has written to the family, denying any involvement in Mr Hashi’s detention, stating that if Mr Hashi is a British citizen then he must contact the Foreign Office. Last night his mother said: ‘We are very worried about him and just want to know what has happened.’ The only justification Mrs May has given for removing Mr Hashi’s citizenship is his alleged involvement in Islamic extremism. But his family say he has never been interested in any kind of extremist behaviour. In 2009 Mr Hashi complained to his MP Frank Dobson and the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, the body which oversees MI5, that he was being harassed by security officers because he had refused to work as a spy in his North London Muslim community. In April that year, when he was working as a care worker for a very ill man in North London, Mr Hashi had gone to Gatwick to take a plane to visit his sick grandmother in Djibouti. But as he was checking in he was stopped by two plainclothes officers. One identified himself as ‘Richard’ and said he was working for MI5,  Mr Hashi said in his complaint to the tribunal. Mr Hashi said: ‘He warned me not to get on the flight. He said, “Whatever happens to you outside the UK is not our responsibility.” I was shocked.’ Mr Hashi continued with his flight but at Djibouti airport he was stopped at passport control, held for 16 hours and then deported back to the UK. He claims Djibouti security officers told him their orders came from London. After landing at Heathrow he was detained again and visited by ‘Richard’. ‘He said it was them who sent me back because I was a terror suspect.’ Mr Hashi alleged the officer made it clear his ‘suspect’ status and travel restrictions would be lifted only if he agreed to co-operate with MI5. ‘He said, “By co-operating with us we know you’re not guilty”' Mr Hashi refused and complained to the tribunal and Mr Dobson. His lawyers, solicitor Saghir Hussain and barrister Faisal Saifee, say Mr Hashi left for Somalia in December 2009 to visit his family and intended to return to the UK in the near future to study engineering. Mr Hussain said: ‘It seems his imprisonment in Djibouti is the execution of a threat made in 2009 by MI5. What sort of country is this when you are spirited away to another state and your own Government’s response is to take away your citizenship?’ In a letter to the Home Office the Hashi family lawyers have asked for information that will help them provide legal representation to Mr Hashi during his detention. The Home Office responded: ‘It has been the policy of successive governments neither to confirm or deny speculation, allegations or assertion in respect of intelligence matters. This policy is maintained, and accordingly the Secretary of State can neither confirm nor deny the allegations made on behalf of your client.’","Mahdi Hashi is thought to be in prison in the African state of Djibouti .

"A photograph widely circulating on social media last night purported to show a Russian separatist fighter stealing a ring from a victim of the MH17 crash.

The image appears to show a rebel fighter handling a gold ring amid the wreckage . Hunt for clues? A rebel fighter is filmed rifling through the bag of one of the 298 MH17 crash victims . The suggestion is that it could have been found amid a victim’s belongings or even taken from a body. The image, which appears to have been first tweeted in Russian by the user ‘stabilizec’, was shared thousands of times on Twitter. There was a furious backlash online with many users voicing their distaste at the picture despite any confirmation of what it showed. Sean Callaghan from Cheshire called it ‘an appalling act of inhumanity’. Others, however, said rebels may have been looking for an inscription to identify a body. The image came as a video given to the BBC showed other pro-Russia fighters emptying out the luggage of victims of the tragedy.

Dutch Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans told Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko that his country was 'angry' and 'furious' by reports of bodies being dragged around the site in Grabovo, Donetsk. 'We are already shocked by the news we got today of bodies being dragged around, of the site not being treated properly,' he said.

"Illinois representative Keith Farnham has been charged with using state and personal computers to trade child pornography. The 66-year-old allegedly boasted about molesting a six-year-old girl and used online chat rooms to discuss his fantasies. When he resigned on March 19, one week after his Elgin office and home were raided, he claimed he was standing down because of health concerns. Scroll down for video . Investigation: Illinois state representative Keith Farnham, pictured when he announced his resignation on March 19, is facing child porn charges . On Monday the Democrat, who twice sponsored Bills to impose stricter sentences on pedophiles, was accused of using online chat rooms to trade images and videos of child abuse. Authorities linked a Yahoo! email . account used by the married father-of-one to an online trading forum, . the Chicago Tribune reported. Allegations: Farnham, 66, is accused of trading graphic images and videos . In one online conversation in November, Farnham allegedly described molesting a six-year-old girl and having sexual intercourse with the child's mother while the girl watched. The retired Navy veteran is not currently facing charges over the alleged encounter. In other online chats linked to his email address, the state representative allegedly discussed videos that were being shared. According to the affidavit, in one message he allegedly said: '12 is about as old as I can handle. I love them at 6 7 8.' The affidavit claims that between August 2013 and January of this year, hundreds of images and video, including one of a six-month-old baby being abused, were shared from the email address. Several attachments, showing young girls being forced to perform sex acts on adult men, were allegedly sent from Farnham's state office computer. One piece of equipment seized was marked 'Property of the State of Illinois House of Representatives'. Raid: On March 13, one week before he resigned, Farnham's Elgin home and office were investiagted . Farnham was investigated after an anonymous tip to homeland security agents. A search of the email address allegedly used by the state represenative revealed the files and graphic chats with at least three other individuals. The internet activity was traced to an account at Farnham's home. According to My Fox Chicago, some of the conversations Farnham allegedly had were with an undercover agent posing as a chat room user. The agent was also the person to whom sick videos of child abuse were later emailed. When Farnham resigned last month he said: 'I have been battling serious health issues for a number of years, and the coming months will require my full attention.' He had represented Illinois since 2009 and was chair of the Government Relations Committee, according to his candidate biography. The state representative had championed two Bills for tougher sentencing on child pornography in recent years, including one calling for harsher penalties when the victims are under 13.

"Gerard Depardieu, the titan of French cinema and renowned bon vivant, claims he sometimes drinks up to 14 bottles of wine a day. Even a quintuple heart bypass operation 14 years ago does not seem to have tempered the actor's drinking, nor a serious motorcycle crash while over the legal limit. The 65-year-old Frenchman’s fondness for wine is such that he runs his own award-winning vineyard in the Medoc. He told French magazine So Film: 'I can’t drink like a normal person. I can absorb 12, 13, 14 bottles per day. Scroll down for video . Mon Dieu! Gerard Depardieu recently told a French film magazine: 'I can’t drink like a normal person. I can absorb 12, 13, 14 bottles per day' 'In the morning, it starts at home with champagne or red wine before 10am, then again champagne.' Gerard said he breaks up the wine intake with a little aniseed liqueur pastis. He added: 'Then food, accompanied by two bottles of wine. 'In the afternoon, champagne, beer and more pastis at around 5pm, to finish off the bottle. 'Later on, vodka and/or whisky. But I’m never totally drunk, just a little p*****d. 'All you need is a 10-minute nap and voila, a slurp of rose wine and I feel as fresh as a daisy. 'Anyway, I’m not going to die. Not now. I still have energy.' Wine lover: Gerard Depardieu during a visit to the 'Vinexpo' international wine fair in Bordeaux, south-western France in 2005. He runs his own award-winning vineyard in the Medoc . However, his behaviour was condemned by French mental health expert Professor Michel Lejoyeux, who blasted French attitudes to the heavy consumption of alcohol, and the media's admiration of his alcohol intake. He said: 'We smile about heavy users, calling them ""bon vivants"", while non-consumption is not allowed. In society, it is the one who does not drink who will feel guilty. 'A consumption of 14 bottles a day is beyond all data, all thresholds and health references of the World Health Organization. 'This is proof of the positive vision we have of alcohol poisoning.' Comrades: Depardieu, seen her with Vladimir Putin, took Russian citizenship in January 2013 as a protest against France's 75 per cent tax on the rich . Previously Depardieu made headlines after he was banned from an Air France flight for urinating in the aisle as it prepared to take off, forcing the plane to turn back to its parking spot. A passenger on the flight said Depardieu appeared to be drunk and insisted he be allowed to use the bathroom during takeoff, when passengers must remain seated. Depardieu, who took Russian citizenship in January 2013 as a protest against France's 75 per cent tax on the rich, recently came under fire for suggesting Ukraine was part of Russia. He was asked in an interview at the Baltic Pearl film festival in Latvia about the Ukraine situation and declared he 'loves both Russia, and Ukraine, which is part of Russia'. The actor was presented with his Russian passport by President Vladimir Putin himself and he launched a luxury watch line under the banner 'Proud To Be Russian'.","Actor told a French film magazine: 'I can't drink like a normal person'

"The Pope last night backed military action in Iraq to stop the bloody persecution of thousands of Christians by Islamist fanatics. In a dramatic intervention, Pope Francis said military force could be justified against the murderous extremists of Islamic State in order to counter their ‘unjust aggression’. He also revealed he is considering making an extraordinary visit to northern Iraq to show solidarity with Christians who are being murdered, raped and driven from their homes by the terrorists who have seized control of large swathes of Iraq. Pope Francis has stated military intervention in Iraq is justified to prevent extremists' 'unjust aggression' His intervention came at the end of another day of fast-moving developments in which: . Church leaders have criticised the slow response of the West to the persecution of Christians in Iraq and other parts of the Middle East. But the Pope last night went much further, giving conditional backing to the use of military force to halt the march of Islamic State. Speaking to journalists while returning from a trip to South Korea, Pope Francis indicated he would prefer military action to be backed by the United Nations. Asked if he approved of the unilateral American action on militants he said: ‘In these cases, where there is an unjust aggression, I can only say that it is licit to stop the unjust aggressor. ‘I underscore the verb “stop”. I’m not saying “bomb” or “make war”, just stop. And the means that can be used to stop them must be evaluated.’ He has also claimed he could take a trip to northern Iraq himself to show solidarity with persecuted Christians . A Peshmerga fighter pictured in battle with Islamic State forces 20km east of Mosul, Iraq . Kurdish forces driving near the town of Makhmur, south of Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan . The Pope also said he and his advisers were considering whether he might go to northern Iraq himself to show solidarity with persecuted Christians. His comments represent a remarkable about-turn for the Vatican, which has vehemently opposed any military intervention in recent years. Only last year Pope Francis staged a global prayer and fast for peace when the West was threatening air strikes against Syria. But the ferocity of the attacks against Christians in recent weeks has raised the issue of whether intervention in Iraq could be considered a ‘just war’. Mr Cameron yesterday risked charges of complacency after quietly departing for a second summer holiday. The Prime Minister insisted he would remain in charge of Britain’s response to the Iraq crisis during a week-long break to Cornwall. Mr Cameron said he would remain ‘within a few feet’ of his BlackBerry mobile phone even while on the beach. ‘I always make sure there are senior ministers on duty in Westminster,’ he said after delivering a speech in central London. ‘But I don’t hand over the Government to a deputy. Wherever I am, wherever I am in the world, I am always within a few feet of a BlackBerry and an ability to manage things should they need to be managed. ‘For the next few days I shall not be terribly far away, so if that’s necessary you will find me at my desk.’ Cameron has been criticised for going on holiday while the atrocities and humanitarian crisis in Iraq intensifies . David Cameron and his wife Samantha at a market on the southwestern coast of Portugal earlier this month . But Labour MP Ann Clwyd, Britain’s former special envoy to Iraq, said it was extraordinary that Mr Cameron was pressing ahead with his holiday at a time of crisis. She told the Daily Mail: ‘The Prime Minister should not be going on holiday at such a volatile time. He’s been sounding off, saying Islamic State is a threat to the West. He is right to do that but it just not acceptable to then push off on holiday.’ Miss Clwyd said Parliament should be recalled to debate the crisis. She said she would back some form of military intervention, including the rescue of an estimated 3,000 women and girls of the Yazidi sect captured by fanatics. Some Tory MPs also added to pressure for a recall of Parliament. Conor Burns said: ‘Parliament should be recalled ... so MPs can debate what is going on in Iraq, and we are very naive if we think that what is unfolding on the streets of Iraq has nothing to do with us.’ Earlier, Mr Cameron insisted the Government has a ‘fully worked through’ strategy to deal with the threat of Islamic State, including police action to tackle supporters in this country. He said Britain was ‘not going to get involved in another war in Iraq’. ‘We are not going to be putting boots on the ground,’ he said. ‘Yes, we should use all the assets that we have – our diplomacy, our political relationships, our aid, the military prowess, the expertise that we have to help others ... to put pressure on Islamic State and make sure ... it cannot cause mayhem on our own streets.’ Number 10 said a recall of Parliament was ‘not on the cards’ unless the situation changes.

"Pink petunias nestle with rhododendron. Ivy tumbles down from potted red geraniums. Foxgloves peek their heads through a herb bed of mint, rosemary and sage. It could be any English country garden in bloom... yet this glorious display isn’t quite what it seems. It was constructed entirely of fake flowers and greenery. Artificial flowers and leaves, once condemned as ‘tacky’, have reached new heights of realism and are proving ever more popular. Scroll down for video . Blooming lovely: The MoS has created a garden composed entirely of fake blooms. Above, Annabel Grossman toasts the artificial plot... with a real glass of Bucks Fizz .

So The Mail on Sunday set about creating a garden composed entirely of ‘fake’ plants and blooms. For our quintessentially English garden, we chose a driveway outside a home in rural Somerset. The space was covered with gravel and featured barely any plant life. Our transformation started with 20ft by 13ft of artificial turf, which was laid, secured to the ground and brushed.

After that, the fake lawn was laid using a large brush (left) Fixed into beds: The garden contained typical summer flowers, which were bought flat-packed and just needed to be gently re-shaped before being fixed into the beds . Then a backdrop of ‘evergreens’ was set in the flowerbeds. This mostly consisted of topiary, including lollipop bay ‘trees’ in fake lead pots and a 5ft ‘bamboo tree’. Around this base we spread a woodchip mulch for the smaller flowers. Aside from the garden furniture, the mulch is the only non-fake material in the display. Our garden contained typical summer flowers, such as foxgloves, dahlias, geraniums and magnolia. The plastic flowers are bought flat-packed and just need to be gently re-shaped before being fixed into the beds.

"It's one of the the sexiest nights on television and its stunning models and superstar singing acts draw in millions of viewers every year. But what really goes on behind the scenes of the iconic annual Victoria's Secret show? Two of the lingerie giant's most famous Angels have revealed that the show, which saw the likes of Rihanna and Justin Bieber perform this year, is 'pure madness'. The annual Victoria's Secret show is one of the sexiest nights on TV and now two Angels have revealed that it is 'madness' behind the scenes . Speaking to Vogue.co.uk, Erin Heatherton said it's all: 'Big personalities, big hair. 'It's a lot of fun - I think there's something special and timeless about girls getting ready together. This is the ultimate display - head-to-toe.' Behati Prinsloo added: 'It's a girls club! It's kind of manic back there, but also fun and exciting.' The lavish event, which has seen the likes of Miranda Kerr, Cara Delevingne and Jourdan Dunn strut down the catwalk in elaborately embellished lingerie, attracts hundreds of celebrities and entertainers and each year has a different theme. The models don giant angel and butterfly wings, as well as peacock and ostrich feathers, which have all become emblematic of the Victoria's Secret lingerie brand.

Behati Prinsloo, 24, was discovered by Sarah Doukas of Storm models - who also spotted Cara Delevingne and Kate Moss - and was signed as the face of Pink, the brand's younger line, in 2008. She has since walked for numerous high-end designers and just announced her engagement to Maroon 5 singer Adam Levine. Erin Heatherton, 24, who is currently the face of the XOXO Spring/Summer 2013 line, says her favourite thing about Victoria's Secret is 'having the opportunity to play with my femininity'. 'It's a kind of creativity I never tapped into growing up. 'I love to learn and Victoria's . Secret has given me more opportunities than I ever thought possible. I . like doing things that scare me - I've learned never to doubt myself.' And it seems that being a part of the brand is literally paying off: five out of the top 10 highest-earning models for 2012 were long-serving Angels, according to Forbes.

"Change: Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, pictured Friday addressing the Boy Scouts of America's annual meeting, says he would have allowed openly gay Scoutmasters in the youth organization . Robert Gates, the new president of the Boy Scouts of America, said Friday that he would have moved last year to allow openly gay adults in the organization but said he opposes any further attempts to address the policy now. Gates took over an organization this week that serves about 2.5million youth but faces continued membership declines and fights over its inclusion of openly gay boys, but not adults. Gates, the former secretary of defense who oversaw the end of the military's 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy, addressed those issues Friday, a day after Scouting's national leadership elected him president. 'I was prepared to go further than the decision that was made,' Gates told The Associated Press in an interview in advance of a speech before the group's national leaders at its annual meeting in Nashville, Tennessee. 'I would have supported having gay Scoutmasters, but at the same time, I fully accept the decision that was democratically arrived at by 1,500 volunteers from across the entire country.' The BSA's National Council voted at last year's annual meeting to accept openly gay youth, after a monthslong process with protests on both sides. Gates planned to tell Scouting's leaders Friday that a continued fight over the issue threatens BSA's future. 'Given the strong feelings — the passion — involved on both sides of this matter, I believe strongly that to re-open the membership issue or try to take last year's decision to the next step would irreparably fracture and perhaps even provoke a formal, permanent split in this movement — with the high likelihood neither side would subsequently survive on its own,' Gates said in prepared remarks. Gates, 70, who also served as director of the CIA, is a visible advocate for Scouting as it faces a storm of bad publicity. Gates, who took over an organization this week that serves about 2.5million youth, said he opposes any further attempts to address the policy pertaining to gay adults in Boy Scouts . Words of caution: Gates has warned that re-opening the membership issue could cause an irreparable schism within the movement . The Scouts reached out to Gates as he was retiring from the Defense Department and asked him to join their leadership, said Wayne Perry, the departing BSA president. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, who was expected to become president this year, agreed to wait another two years to allow Gates to serve now, Perry said. 'We need America to know what the Boy Scouts can do for the youth of America,' Perry said, adding that Gates 'immediately can reach an audience that we wouldn't otherwise reach.' Gates earned his Eagle Scout award as a 15-year-old growing up in Wichita, Kansas. He has long credited that achievement for giving him the confidence to excel in nearly five decades of public service, and he stayed involved in Scouting during his career. He has recalled skeet-shooting with young Scouts while he was director of the CIA. Along the way, Gates became known as someone willing to speak frankly about problems in the institutions he led, often at the risk of offending others. Gates warned BSA's leaders Friday that 'maybe it's time for blunt talk.' Bleeding money: The Boy Scouts of America has been losing sponsors and corporate donors over the group's exclusion of openly gay adults . Over the last decade, the Scouts have faced small, but consistent declines in membership. Also, high-profile sponsors and corporate donors, including Disney and Lockheed Martin, have cut funding over the exclusion of openly gay adults. Meanwhile, a handful of conservatives who opposed the inclusion of openly gay boys started their own organization, Trail Life USA. Key difference: Gates, 70, said unlike with in the CIA or Defense Department, he cannot give a direct order to embrace openly gay adults to a group made up of volunteers . Gates told the AP that he wanted to move the Scouts past that debate and focus on what unites the membership. He said he would push for a heavier focus on local marketing and sharing positive stories about Scouting efforts that are sometimes drowned out by debates over gay rights or child abuse lawsuits filed against the Scouts in several states. He said he would emphasize to sponsors that 'welcoming gay youth is an important step forward.' Gates led the Defense Department when it phased out the ban on openly gay soldiers known as 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell,' something gay-rights groups have cited as a hopeful sign for them. But Gates said Friday that the Scouts were different from the CIA or the military, where 'I could give an order and people would follow it, at least most of the time.' In an organization driven almost entirely by volunteers, officials have to respect differences in opinion, he said. 'The key at this point is to keep focus, again, on the top priority, which is, how do we develop the best possible program for kids, and how do we keep their interests at the forefront?' Gates said.","Former CIA director Robert Gates took over 2.5million-strong youth organization this week .

"It's impossible not to stare at Kim Dillenbeck's dog, Pig. Born in Atlanta with severe deformities and adopted by the Alabama woman, the eight-month-old mutt has gangly legs, a body that appears to have been chopped in half and no neck. Pig looks like one of those fake animals created with Photoshop to draw clicks on websites, yet she's real. 'The whole clinic loves her. She comes in and she's a rock star here,' said Dr. Rachael Hudson-Breland, a veterinarian who treats Pig. Scroll down for video . Rock star: Found in woods near Atlanta, Pig was born with severe deformities, but was adopted and nursed by a woman in Alabama, and has gone on to win the hearts people's all over the world . Pig has multiple health issues, including missing ribs, incorrectly rotated joints, and damaged vertebrae, but has learned to live with her impairments . The friendly little animal hops like a frog to stand up and walks with a high-shouldered gait that resembles a gorilla. Unable to swing her head side to side, Pig spins her whole body to see what's beside her. None of the vets who care for the dog have ever seen another animal with the same condition, said Hudson-Breland, but Dillenbeck has seen a few similar-looking dogs on the Internet. Found as a puppy with three littermates in a wooded area in metro Atlanta, Pig is smaller than her surviving siblings at only 15 or so pounds. Her spine is about 7 inches shorter than normal and wavy, with many bones fused together. Dillenbeck, who first saw the dog during a Christmas visit and later brought her home, said coming up with a name wasn't difficult. 'When she was really, really little she looked like a little fuzzy piglet,' said Dillenbeck, who lives in nearby Helena. Vets advised to have Pig put down. She was not expected to live because of her deformities, but has defied the odds and gone on to lead a fairly ordinary animal life. However, most household dogs aren't famous. Adorable! Now eight-months-old, the happy pooch is seen going for a walk here when she was younger . Howling with delight? Pig is seen here looking upwards . Looking on: Owner Kim Dillenbeck keeps an eye on Pig . Woman's best friend: Owner Kim Dillenbeck is seen here with Pig . The dog that could: Pig is seen going for treat from Dillenbeck . Tens of thousands of people have watched Internet videos of Pig since she had a coming-out party during a community event in Birmingham last month, and Pig has her own Facebook page with more than 3,400 followers. Many have tried to pinpoint what breed she is, seemingly having some Akita and German Shepherd in her. Dillenback lovingly says, however: 'She's a mutt.' Pig first made her debut in a story published by AOL.com . Last week, dog owners at a suburban park lost track of their own animals as they stopped to watch Pig play in water and run around surprisingly quickly. Dillenbeck said it's the same anytime Pig ventures out in public. 'She always draws a crowd,' she said. Visiting the park with her boyfriend and two dogs, ballet dancer Tricia Bianco didn't know quite what to make of Pig. 'She is like a little pig. She's cute,' Bianco said. Take a moment and paws: Pig is ready for her close-up . Little Pig! The pup was rescued after she was heard barking in the woods . Unique: Pig's shape can be better seen in these X-rays .

Pig is seen curling up . Pig plays and runs with other animals, and Hudson-Breland said the dog doesn't have any major health problems. But Pig does tire easily, and she sometimes loses her balance and topples over like a toddler. Overall, though, Pig is in great shape for the shape she's in. 'I don't think Pig really knows that she looks different,' Hudson-Breland said.","Pig, a half-dog with significant impairments, was born in the wild and found abandoned in woods outside of Atlanta .

"We've gone batty for these cute pictures, which show tiny abandoned baby bats wrapped up in blankets, being fed from bottles.

About 300 bat pups are orphaned every year because their mother is ill and can't feed them or has died from tick paralysis. These cute pictures show tiny abandoned baby bats wrapped up in blankets, being fed from bottles . Normally we associate bats with being blood-thirsty, but all these cute critters want to drink is some bottled milk.

Volunteers Ashleigh Johnson and Amy Green care for the baby bats like newborn babies, making sure they are well tucked in to their blackets . Gripping on for dear life, the baby bats have been stricken by the deadly tick paralysis disease . During the 1990s, flying foxes were mysteriously dying on the Atherton Tableland.

"The Premier League is often described as the most exciting division in world football, and it certainly matches Spain’s La Liga for goal action. But as Sportsmail's wide-ranging study of the world’s football leagues reveals, both are outstripped by Germany’s Bundesliga among their 'Big Five’ rivals, and fans of nine other major divisions around the world see more goals per game. Using numbers for the most recently complete seasons in 34 leagues around the world, the Austrian league has more goals per game than anywhere (3.31 per game) followed by the Dutch top division (3.20) and then Bundesliga (3.16). Those are the only three averaging more than three goals a game. The Premier League saw 1,052 goals scored last season, including this by Sergio Aguero against Tottenham . Alexis Sanchez has already scored 12 goals for Arsenal since his summer move from Barcelona . Luis Suarez was the Premier League's top scorer last season, his 31 included this beauty against Norwich . The Premier League is 10th on the list of 34 leagues around the world, with 2.77 goals per game to La Liga's 2.75 per game in 11th place. Italy’s Serie A is 15th (2.72 goals a game) and France's Ligue 1 down in 28th, with 2.45 goals per game. One quirky feature of the goal-scoring findings - for the seasons considered at least - is that the more northerly the league, the likelier a high-scoring tally of goals per game. The six top divisions in goals per game were all in the northern-most group of countries in the study (Austria, Holland, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland) while the six lowest-scoring leagues were all in the southern-most group of nations (Nigeria, Algeria, Argentina, South Africa, Portugal and Colombia). There were an average of 2.75 goals per game in La Liga last season, Lionel Messi scored quite a few of them . Serie A had the second lowest goal-to-game ratio of Europe's top five leagues, despite Carlos Tevez's efforts . Whether this is because climatic differences tend to mean northern football is faster and more error-prone in cold places but slower and lower-scoring when it’s hot is far from clear. But France was the only 'northerly' country among the dozen lowest-scoring leagues, with 2.45 goals per game last season. Scotland’s Premiership is a middle-ranking league in goals terms, with 2.75 scored per game last season putting it in 13th place, fractionally behind La Liga and Australia’s A-League.

"With a harpist greeting guests, catering by an award-winning chef, a free bar and a personalised fireworks display, it was a wedding designed to impress.

All the directors were invited to her . wedding to Graham Lane – who works for an alarm firm – in January, with . other colleagues joining for the reception. The event at the mock-Tudor . Great Hall at Mains, near Blackpool, cost up to £40,000. Guests were . serenaded by harpist Maxine Molin-Rose and were served canapés with . buck’s fizz while being entertained by a saxophonist and magician. The wedding breakfast was provided by . celebrity chef Paul Heathcote’s firm and was accompanied by a swing . singer, followed by a free bar and music from a Motown-style band plus a . DJ. Children were entertained by . face-painting and balloon-modelling while all guests were given feather . masks to get them in the spirit of the occasion. Such was the attention to detail that . the new Mrs Lane and her bridesmaids all had black Ugg boots matching . their outfits  to protect them from the cold when photographs were taken . outside. All the bridesmaids were given jewel-encrusted iPods to take home with them. My big fraudulent wedding: Kirsty Lane and her bridesmaids show off some bizarre matching Uggs at the ceremony in Lancashire . Sealed with a kiss: The couple's lavish wedding took place at Mains venue in Little Singleton, near Blackpool . The evening ended with a fireworks display featuring the couple’s initials illuminated as the centrepiece. They left in a white limousine for a . ‘minimoon’ in the Lake District before their main honeymoon in Mexico. ‘It was really over the top from the moment we arrived to the time we . left,’ said a colleague who was there. ‘They had absolutely everything you . could wish for, and it must have cost tens of thousands. We even joked . with Kirsty that we were going to go back to the office and check the . accounts. ‘She certainly wasn’t well off, and . the story we were given was that her mother had been made redundant and . the money she received was paying for it.’ Days after the wedding, while  Mrs . Lane was still in the Lake District, managing director Mr Sutton was . alerted to a problem with an invoice. Rolling in it: The bride's dream wedding was funded by false invoices that she paid into her bank account . A day to remember... for all the wrong reasons: Kirsty Lane and her fiance Graham at their lavish wedding bash, which treated guests to an extravagant party . Ordinarily he would have dismissed it . as a genuine mistake but, having seen how spectacular her wedding had . been, he decided to dig deeper, company sources said. There was enough evidence to suspend . her on her return from the Lake District. A full investigation was . launched and she was arrested shortly before the pair were due to jet . out to Mexico. ‘If she had been in work when the problem surfaced, she . would have been able to hide it like she had for so long,’ Mr  Sutton . said. ‘But because I was already getting suspicious, it all started to come out. It was a very clever, incredibly devious operation.’ Two people lost their jobs as a . result of the firm’s struggles following Lane’s fiddling. She had been . using real invoices to existing suppliers to create extra payments into . her own bank account for more than two years. It took two months to uncover the full extent of the deception. No expense spared: Canapes were served at the reception, along with Buck's Fizz amid ornate flower displays . Mr Sutton said the firm had even loaned Lane £7,000 and increased her wages after she complained of struggling financially. ‘We are not a large company,’ he . added. ‘How it didn’t sink us I don’t know. It is only through the sheer . determination of the rest of the team that we are still here.’ The firm, which has 18 employees and specialises in audiovisual equipment for offices, is now recovering. Lane, from Adlington, near Chorley, . had allegedly stolen about £168,000, also using the money to buy . luxuries including a £1,500 jewel-encrusted case for her iPad. She admitted ten counts of fraud . worth a total of £38,000 at Leyland Magistrates’ Court and asked for a . further 112 to be considered. She will be sentenced later  while her husband will face court next month.","She hired a harpist to greet guests and food from an award-winning chef .

"Scorned: Mercy Ogbedo, 45, outside London's High Court, who has been told to pay her billionaire ex-husband's £100,000 legal costs even though he was already married when they wed . A woman who claims she was duped into a wedding with a billionaire who was already married has been ordered to pay him £100,000, a court heard yesterday. Mercy Ogbedo believed she married shipping magnate Moses Taiga in an elaborate ceremony in Nigeria where her feet were washed by village elders and a dowry was paid for her as a ‘bride price’. The couple had twins together, but Mrs Ogbedo then spent a decade pursuing the tycoon for financial support through the British courts – only to be told she would not get a penny because their wedding ceremony was invalid. Instead, the 45-year-old of Finchley, North London, was ordered to pay 80 per cent of Mr Taiga’s legal costs for a series of complex court hearings, leaving her with an estimated £100,000 bill for lawyers’ fees. Mrs Ogbedo went to the Court of Appeal yesterday in a bid to get the order overturned. The court heard she had ‘limited means’ while her ‘husband’ owned a string of London properties. The pair ‘married’ in 2002 and had twins, but Mrs Ogbedo discovered soon afterwards that Mr Taiga had already married a woman in Benin, West Africa. The court heard that having more than one wife is allowed under Nigerian law, but Mrs Ogbedo applied to the British courts in 2003 to have her marriage dissolved because of her husband’s behaviour, and to force Mr Taiga to pay maintenance for their children. The High Court ordered she should be given £300,000 a year – but Mr Taiga went to the Nigerian courts and successfully argued that their wedding was invalid, because of his church marriage in Benin. The court ruled that Mrs Ogbedo’s was a ‘non-marriage’, which meant precisely nothing in the eyes of the law. The High Court then ruled it could not hand over any of Mr Taiga’s fortune because he was never legally married to Mrs Ogbedo, and that she should pay most of his legal costs. Her lawyers branded that decision ‘incomprehensible’ and said she should be entitled to a payout. New life: Mr Taiga, left, has now married a third woman, Yinka Taiga, right, with whom he has quadruplets . Barrister Timothy Scott QC, for Mrs Ogbedo, said: ‘The wife says she was duped. She should be permitted to apply for financial relief in England by virtue of that marriage ceremony.’ Since his split from Mrs Ogbedo, Mr Taiga has ended his 1974 Benin marriage and wed another woman, Yinka, with whom he has quadruplets. Ruling on Mrs Ogbedo’s case, Appeal Court judge Lord Justice McFarlane said he had ‘real sympathy’ for her position, adding: ‘All the time the wife considered that she was married to her husband he was in fact married to another lady.’ However, he said he could not allow her to appeal over a divorce payout because ‘there was no marriage on which English law could bite’. He said he would allow her to appeal against the order that she should pay Mr Taiga’s costs. Lord Justice McFarlane said it was arguable that the sum was unfair, adding: ‘She has the sole care of the parties’ children and is a lady of limited means.’","Mercy Ogbedo claims she was 'duped' into marrying magnate Moses Taiga .

"Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Matthews Burwell met privately with dozens of governors Sunday as the Obama administration tried to get support from the leaders of states that will host thousands of the Central American children who have crossed the Mexican border on their own since Oct. 1. Governors of both parties expressed concerns about the cost to states, including providing public education for the children, according to those who attended the meeting. Burwell left the meeting through a side door without talking to reporters. 'Our citizens already feel burdened by all kinds of challenges. They don't want to see another burden come into their state,' said Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat. 'However we deal with the humanitarian aspects of this, we've got to do it in the most cost-effective way possible.' Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad were among the most vocal Republican critics. They seized on the administration's plans to place the children with friends or family members without checking on their immigration status. Scroll down for video . Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (L), joked with President Joe Biden at the National Governors Association convention on Friday, but was starkly critical two days later of the Obama administration's request to house illegal immigrant children in hist state . Drink but don't dump: Obama and Hickenlooper shared a beer-and-billiards afternoon on July 8, but the Democratic governor was cold to the idea of opening up the Rocky Mountain state to an influx of kids streaming across the southwest U.S. border . Under current law, immigrant children from countries that don't border the United States and who cross into this country by themselves are turned over to HHS within 72 hours. From there, they often are reunited with parents or placed with other relatives already living in the country, while they wait for an immigration court to decide their future. The court process can take years. Neither Burwell's agency nor immigration officials check the immigration status of relatives who take custody of the immigrant children. Since Oct. 1 more than 57,000 children have crossed the border alone. Most are from Honduras, El Salvador or Guatemala. 'We want to make sure they're placed in a safe and supportive home or placement, but also, it should be somebody that is legal and somebody that will be responsible to see that they show up for the hearing,' Branstad said. According to data from the Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review, about a quarter of immigrants facing deportations hearings don't show up as ordered. The no-show rate for the juvenile immigration court docket is about 46 percent. Amid the debate of what is causing the ongoing crush of child immigrants and how the government can stem the flow, two key lawmakers said President Barack Obama can take administrative action to relieve much of the crisis without waiting for what is likely to be a contentious and lengthy Congressional battle. At issue is a provision in a 2008 human trafficking law that puts the fate of these immigrants in the hands of immigration judges. The Obama administration has expressed some interest in asking Congress to change the law to give the administration more leeway in dealing with the crisis. Four hundred child immigrants now enter the U.S. illegally every day as authorities liken growing humanitarian crises in makeshift centers to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina . But Rep. Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday that wholesale changes by Congress may not be necessary and that Obama has the authority to return the children to their native countries. Obama 'has tools in his toolbox' to deal with humanitarian issues and deter more children from coming to the U.S., Rogers said. 'We can safely get them home,' Rogers said on NBC's 'Meet the Press.' He said, 'And that's where the president needs to start. So he needs to re-engage, get folks who are doing administrative work on the border. They need to make sure they send a very clear signal.' Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the author of the provision in the human trafficking law, said a change in regulations, not the law, could speed the children's return. The law already allows HHS and the Homeland Security Department to write regulations to deal with 'exceptional circumstances' that would allow officials to return the children more quickly to their home countries, Feinstein said Thursday at a hearing on a $3.7 billion emergency budget request from the White House to deal with the growing crisis on the border. Some of the money would go to help fund about 40 additional immigration judge teams. Federal immigration courts have a backlog of more than 375,000 cases.","HHS secretary met with dozens of governors on Sunday to pitch them on relocating thousands of illegal immigrant kids to their states .

"A school has banned triangular flapjacks on health and safety grounds after a pupil was hit in the eye by one during a lunch-time food fight. Dinner ladies at the comprehensive school were told to cut flapjacks into squares or rectangles only from now on after the Year 7 boy was sent home complaining of a sore eye. This morning a spokesman for Essex County Council confirmed the ban on triangular treats at Castle View School on Canvey Island was true. Danger: Castle View School in Essex has deemed the pointy corners of triangular flapjacks a health hazard . The new ruling on flapjacks, which have been served at the school for 15 years, was imposed by head Gill Thomas soon after the incident in the canteen last Wednesday. The boy complained to staff that his eye hurt after he was struck in the eye by the corner of a flying flapjack, and was sent home for the afternoon, although his injuries did not merit hospital treatment. The incident was reported to the head, and within 24 hours, school manager Keith Evans held a meeting for catering staff at the school, deemed 'satisfactory' by Ofsted, and told them to serve only four-sided flapjacks in future. A source said: 'Catering staff were told the pointy, triangular flapjacks were dangerous after the boy hurt his eye. 'This doesn't address the fact that the children can cut them into pointy shapes if they wish, or the issue of behaviour in the canteen.'

"A woman who admitted to kidnapping two Amish girls with her boyfriend says they were on a 'shopping trip' for slaves. The details of the girls', aged 7 and 12, abduction was further revealed in a hearing Thursday for Nicole Vaisey in St Lawrence County, NY court. Vaisey turned herself into police last week after she and boyfriend Stephen Howells Jr kidnapped the two Amish girls from their family farm near Oswegatchie, New York - luring them to a parked car with a puppy. Scroll down for video . Behind bars: Nicole Vaisey was denied bail in court today after being her arrest in connection to the kidnapping of two Amish sisters from their farm in Upstate New York with her boyfriend Stephen Howells Jr. Above, Vaisey is escorted into court on Thursday . Under orders: Vaisey's defense attorney says she was her boyfriend's 'slave' and therefore 'not as culpable' in the kidnapping . The 25-year-old's attorney says she was in a 'master-slave relationship' with her boyfriend, and therefore not as culpable for the crime. The girls were held against their will for 24 hours, but eventually released after the couple became frightened by broadcasts about the massive search. After coming forward to police, Vaisey detailed her dominant/submissive relationship with Howells and how they went about searching for slaves. The couple faces charges of kidnapping with intent to sexually abuse or physically hard the girls. Scared: Vaisey (left) and boyfriend Stephen Howells Jr (right) were arrested last week for the kidnapping of from their farm in Upstate New York. The two girls reappeared 24 hours after their disappearance when they were let go because the couple feared arrest . She says the couple had been looking for  slaves, and she decided on the two Amish girls after previously buying produce from their farm stand. She described the search as a 'shopping trip'. On August 13, Howells dropped off his three children with his ex around 6:30pm and then the couple went to the farm stand, where Vaisey parked their white car out of sight, underneath a tree. Her boyfriend then got out and greeted the two girls, asking if they wanted to see a puppy he had in the back seat of the car. The couple tied the golden retriever/Doberman mix to the driver's side in the back seat, so that the girls would have to lean in, in order to pet. The girls agreed, but on the way to the car, one of them got scared and started to scream. That's when Howells forced the girls into the back of the vehicle and Vaisey sped off back to their home in Hermon. Relief: Amish community members gather at the home of the two kidnapped girls, after their return Thursday . Vaisey says the girls spent most of their time as captives shackled to the couple's bed. But after about 24 hours, the couple became frightened by the news broadcasts about the girls' disappearance, and decided to drop them off in an isolated area near Bigelow, New York. Authorities previously said the girls were sexually abused before the couple let them go. The girls ran to the first house they found, and the couple who answered the door then drove them home. While Ms Vaisey did not testify at her hearing on Thursday, her attorney said that the nature of her relationship with Howells should factor into the trial. 'She was in a master-slave relationship,' her attorney Bradford Riendeau said Thursday. 'I believe she's not as culpable as he is.' 'She was the submissive one,' he said last week. 'I am currently researching on what happens when prisoners of war go through enhanced interrogation. What torture has done to her personality to determine just how compliant she was? Was it really voluntary? Can you really give consent to be tortured?' Howells waived his right to a hearing, so that his case may go straight to a grand jury. Home: The girls' disappearance launched a major search in the area. The couple was arrested on Friday at their home in Richville, New York (investigators pictures searching the home above) Horrifying: Howells Jr has three children of his own, and dropped them off with an ex before kidnapping the two Amish sisters, his girlfriend Vaisey revealed . The girls' kidnappings touched off a massive search in the Amish family's remote farming community. Searchers scoured the community of about 4,000 people but were hampered by a lack of photos of the girls. The Amish typically avoid modern technology, and the family had to work with an artist who spoke their language, a German dialect known as Pennsylvania Dutch, to produce a sketch of the older girl. The parents, who have 14 children, did not express anger toward the suspects.","Nicole Vaisey and boyfriend Stephen Howells Jr were arrested last week in connection to the kidnapping of two Amish sisters, aged 7 and 12 .

"Norwegian agents tried to stop a suspected Nairobi mall gunman from leaving the country for a life of terror three years ago. Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, a 23-year-old Somalian whom Kenyan authorities believe was one of the terrorists in the Westgate mall seige, was 'well-known' to the PST domestic intelligence service, its chief said yesterday. PST agents tried several times to persuade him to abandon plans to move to Somalia in 2010 - and join jihadist group al-Shabaab - but failed to stop the young man. Scroll down for video . Atrocity: This CCTV image shows a man suspected to be Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow taking aim in a shop inside Nairobi's Westgate mall . The Kenyan government has said that Dhuhulow is one of the men who can be seen in CCTV footage pointing a rifle at cowering victims in the attack last month. On Sunday it announced that it had recovered the remains of four of the gunmen, who were filmed coldly gunning down fleeing shoppers in the upscale mall. Though PST have not yet confirmed that he was one of the attackers, Marie Benedicte Bjoernland, the head of the agency, revealed the dealings with Dhuhulow, who spent his youth in Norway after his family moved there in 1999. She said: 'We had several talks with him... before he left Norway more than three years ago. Obviously we didn't succeed, but there was quite an effort put into the preventive side of this.' Ms Bjoernland did not give any greater detail on the conversations, and admitted that he 'most likely' was killed in the seige. On Sunday the Kenyan government said it believes it has recovered the remains of four gunmen caught carrying out the attack in CCTV footage. Youth: This photo shows Dhuhulow in Larvik, Norway, in 2007 wearing a Chelsea football shirt . The Somali extremist group al-Shabaab claimed responsibility, saying the attack was in retribution for Kenya's military involvement in Somalia. Dhuhulow's sister confirmed last week that her brother went to the Somali capital of Mogadishu for a three-month visit in 2009, then moved to Somalia permanently in March 2010. But she said she didn't believe he was among the gunmen seen in the footage. Just days after Dhuhulow's identity became known, Norwegian police issued international alerts for two Norwegian-Somali sisters, aged 16 and 19, who told their family they were traveling to Syria to join the civil war. They were last spotted on the Turkish-Syrian border. 'We see a growing problem when it comes to people traveling to war zones, and specifically in the last year we've seen a growing number of persons traveling to Syria,' Ms Bjoernland said. She estimated that between 30 and 40 people have left Norway to join the Syrian civil war, but said the number is uncertain and could be even larger. That conflict has attracted hundreds of foreign fighters from European countries, including many members of Islamic militant groups. Many intelligence services are worried at the damage these fighters could do when they return home with combat experience and terrorist training - and possibly combat trauma. Ms Bjoerland said: 'When they are . radicalised and when they are determined to go, for instance to Syria or . other conflict areas, we don't have many legal measures to stop them'. It is now illegal in Norway . to receive training from terror groups - but police and intelligence services struggle to prove whether would-be militants are leaving the country for legitimate reasons - or to join jihadist groups. Brainwashed: According to one of his relatives who watched CCTV footage of shooting he may 'have been brainwashed' Ms Bjoerland said her agency tries to engage with potential terrorists and dissuade them from leaving, but that it often doesn't work. She said: 'We do preventive work. We talk to them. We try to persuade them not to go, because it's a dangerous journey. 'I wish we were more successful. We have succeeded in turning some around from traveling. But quite a few have actually left.' She called on parents, child protective services, police and Muslim leaders to intervene when young Muslims seem at risk of becoming radicalised.","Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow is believed to be one of the Westgate gunmen .

"A top Marine general has warned that President Obama must use the might of the U.S. military to ‘eradicate’ ISIS now – or risk paying the price later with more attacks on the West. General John Allen, who led international forces in Afghanistan, warned that if ISIS is allowed to build a stable base of power in Iraq and Syria it will be able mount more attacks on Americans and American interests. He spoke out in DefenseOne, days after the brutal execution of James Foley – and on the day Chuck Hagel admitted that the threat from ISIS could surpass even that posed by Al Qaeda. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . General John Allen has warned that if ISIS is allowed to build a stable base of power in Iraq and Syria it will be able mount more attacks on Americans and American interests . ‘They are an imminent threat to every interest we have, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else,’ said Hagel on Thursday. ‘They are beyond just a terrorist group. They marry ideology, a sophistication of ...military prowess. They are tremendously well-funded. This is beyond anything we've seen.’ Writing for the DefenseOne website, Allen was quick to praise President Obama for the airstrikes he had already ordered on ISIS camps in northern Iraq, but he went on to urge the President to ‘move quickly to pressure the organisations entire “nervous system”, break it up, and destroy its pieces.’ ‘The U.S. is now firmly in the game and remains the only nation on the planet capable of exerting the kind of strategic leadership, influence and strike capacity to deal with IS,’ he wrote. ‘It is also the only power capable of organizing a coalition’s reaction to this regional and international threat.’ ‘This group is not a flash in the pan that will go away of its own accord or if we don’t poke at it.’ Allen did not propose a return to ground combat, but urged a ‘focused advise and assist’ mission to bolster Iraqi and Kurdish soldiers and non-jihadist Syrian rebels, a commitment that would require a reintroduction of significantly more US military advisers. General Allen praised Obama for recent airstrikes, but urged him to 'move quickly to pressure the organisations entire ""nervous system""' He also warned that the threat from ISIS was not something that was simply limited to the countries in the in Middle East,  but provided a very real treat in the western world too. ISIS foot soldiers with U.K., European, and American passports pose a serious threat to all our safety, he warned - and the organization was clearly more advanced than al-Qaeda. 'It’s worth remembering the Taliban provided the perfect platform from which al-Qaeda attacked the U.S., and the Taliban were and remain as cavemen in comparison to ISIS,' he wrote. General Allen denied that the U.S. military was war weary and was fully capable of attacking and reducing ISIS. ‘We should do it now, but supported substantially by our traditional allies and partners, especially by those in the region who have the most to give – and the most to lose – if the Islamic State’s march continues.' Allen wrote that James Foley’s killing ‘embodies’ the threat from Isis, which he called ‘an entity beyond the pale of humanity’. ‘If we delay now, we will pay later,’ he warned. General Allen's comments came hours after Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel dramatically upgraded the U.S. government's estimation of the threats America faces from the terrorist organization. ISIS is 'as sophisticated and well-funded as any group that we have seen,' Hagel told a group of reporters during a joint press conference he held with Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey. 'They're beyond just a terrorist group.They marry ideology and a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess. They are tremendously well funded. ...This is beyond anything we've seen, so we must prepare for everything.' 'And the only way you do that is that you take a cold, steely, hard look at it and – and – and get ready.' Grave threat: Secretary of Defense Chuck hagel and Chairman of the joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey at the press conference where they delivered the dire warning . Not just airstrikes: Hagel and Dempsey said that much of America's long-term involvement in Iraq will continue to consist of assistance to Iraq's nascent government as it trains volunteers like these Shi'ites, who have joined the battle against ISIS . Battling ISIS 'is going to be a very long contest,' Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey warned on Thursday . 'It's a long-term threat,' he conceded under questioning from reporters, adding moments later that 'the president has been very clear on mission creep. And he's made it very clear that he will not allow that.' Gen. Dempsey warned that America's involvement in Iraq will continue for years to come, citing the intensity of hatred among ethnic, religious and tribal groups there. 'The conflict against those groups – most of which are local, some of which are regional, and some of which are global in nature – that's going to be a very long contest,' he said. 'It's ideological. It's not political. It's religious in many cases. So, yes, it's going to be a very long contest.' At the same time the decorated general cautioned that the 'required participation' of the U.S. would remain one of coalition leadership 'to provide the unique capabilities that we provide, but not necessarily all the capabilities' – a suggestion that an unlimited release of military might to crush ISIS is off the table. Dempsey added later in the briefing that ISIS can't practically be contained in Iraq, since it also has deep roots and tremendous resources across the Syrian border. Forget about Bowe Bergdahl: State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said Thursday that the US does not 'make concessions to terrorists' – including the payment of ransom for the safe return of kidnapped hostages . The terror group 'has an apocalyptic end-of-days strategic vision that will eventually have to be defeated,' the general explained. 'Can they be defeated without addressing that part of the organization that resides in Syria? The answer is no. That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border.' Hagel fielded a question about whether future U.S. military action could include a direct focus on Syria, answering: 'We continue to explore all options.' As American military action expands in Iraq, he said, much of that help is in the form of 'a tremendous amount of military assistance to the Peshmerga through the Iraqi security forces.' 'There's no question that we have been accelerated – as a matter of fact, all year long, we have been accelerated – [through] all the requests made by the Iraqi government for lethal assistance and equipment, and we continue to do that. He downplayed the long-term strategic value of the limited airstrikes that President Barack Obama has authorized, saying that in the long term they could be just a table-setter. Defeating ISIS 'isn't going to just come as a result of airstrikes,' Hagel said. 'Strategically, there are limits to how much you can accomplish with airstrikes. Tactically, you can accomplish a significant amount. I think we've seen that. 'ISIS will only truly be defeated when it's rejected by the 20 million disenfranchised Sunni that happen to reside between Damascus and Baghdad,' he explained. 'It requires a variety of instruments, only one small part of which is airstrikes. I'm not predicting those will occur in Syria, at least not by the United States of America. But it requires the application of all of the tools of national power – diplomatic, economic, information, military.' Hagel and Dempsey also discussed a failed mission to rescue American photojournalist James Foley and other ISIS hostages this summer. An ISIS militant with a British accent beheaded Foley this week in a shocking video that rocketed across the Internet, blaming Obama for airstrikes against ISIS positions in northern Iraq. Earlier on Thursday, State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters that winning Foley's return by paying off ISIS was never an option, and that 'the U.S. Government did not have contact with' ISIS after a warning came that Foley would be killed if airstrikes continued. 'We do not make concessions to terrorists,' she said. 'That includes – we do not pay ransoms.' 'One of the main ways ISI[S] has been funded throughout this conflict has been from ransom payments that others have paid. We believe just in 2014 that that’s in the millions of dollars.' End of the world: The terror group 'has an apocalyptic end-of-days strategic vision that will eventually have to be defeated,' Dempsey explained . R.I.P James Foley: The journalist, dressed in Guantanamo-style orange clothing, was killed on-camera by a masked Islamist belonging to ISIS, who beheaded him with a short knife . 'So we believe that paying ransoms or making concessions,' Harf said, 'would both put our – all Americans overseas – at greater risk for kidnapping and in harm’s way, but that ransoms would also fund and finance exactly the groups we are trying to degrade their capabilities.' Harf did not address the recent return of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from Taliban forces, which was achieved through a prison swap that required the release of five high-value Taliban Islamists from the American military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The Obama administration seems to be treating ISIS as a completely different animal. 'This is not about ISI[S] versus the United States,' Harf said Thursday. 'They are killing anyone who gets in their way – Sunni, Shia Muslims, Christians, Yazidis, Iraqis, Syrians – anyone who gets in their way, and now an American. So this is not about what the United States is or isn’t doing. This is about ISIL’s stated commitment to murder, rape, enslave people who don’t agree with their ideology.'","General John Allen is the latest military leader to speak out against the growing threat of ISIS .
Allen, who led international forces in Afghanistan, said the U.S. had to 'eradicate' the terrorism organization now - or risk attacks in the future .
He praised Obama for recent airstrikes, but urged him to 'move quickly to pressure the organisations entire ""nervous system""'

Police say they were investigating whether Thompson's attack on the cops was linked to Islamic terrorism. ISIS has urged fighters to launch lone wolf attacks in the United States. Thompson's Facebook page features a photograph of a man dressed in Middle Eastern garb and a cover photo displaying Arabic writing. Two attacks in Canada this week by radicalized converts to Islam have killed two Canadian soldiers. In one, a man ran down two soldiers in his car in Quebec, killing one, before being shot dead. On Wednesday a convicted felon ambushed a soldier outside Canadian Parliament, fatally wounding him, before running the Parliament building and opening fire. DNA Info reports that on Thursday afternoon a freelance photographer approached the group of rookie cops and asked to take their photograph.

Another 25-year-old officer was slashed in the back of head and taken to Jamaica Hospital where he is being treated in critical condition, reports CBS. The two remaining police shot at Thompson who dropped his hatchet then died at the scene. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said he's not ruling out terrorism especially in the wake of recent terror attacks in Canada, reports CNN. 'There is nothing we know as of this time that would indicate that were the case. I think certainly the heightened concern is relative to that type of assault based on what just happened in Canada,' said Bratton. CNN reports that Thompson has a criminal record in California and that he was discharged from the U.S. Navy for misconduct. Details of his criminal record and his misconduct are not known at this time. His Facebook page says that Thompson graduated from Columbia Teacher's College and that he resides in Queens. CNN reports that New York police were alerted to be on the lookout for random attacks following Thursday's incident. DNA Info spoke with witnesses on the scene.

"They are desperate, defiant – and determined to get to England. Many had scaled mountains, crossed deserts and sailed across an ocean to get here. Some of their companions had drowned, perished from starvation or been arrested before they made it. Scroll down for video . Huddled in the sun: Africans from the Jungle 2 camp in Calais, France wait for food handouts . Little wonder that on Friday, above a shoreline from which they could see the White Cliffs of Dover, these refugees, homeless chancers and would-be migrants, mainly from Eritrea, Sudan and Ethiopia, were so confident that a new life in Britain would be the next stop. This is the latest illegal encampment to spring up in Calais – and hundreds are currently waiting for the first chance to escape. They have nicknamed it Jungle 2 – a squalid, tented squat on the outskirts of the French port. The previous one in the town was bulldozed two months ago. That followed the clearance in 2009 of the original Jungle area on the outskirts, and the razing of the notorious Sangatte refugee centre in 2002. All of that was meant to have put an end to the constant, ever-growing flow of hopefuls waiting to cross the Channel by any means possible. All it did was to drive them to other parts of Calais. Desperate: Two migrants try to break into a container lorry . And so, Jungle 2 is currently a miserable but convenient stepping-stone to the UK for more than 500 itinerants, a population rapidly swelling with families fleeing Eritrea, Sudan and Ethiopia. So it is not surprising that on Friday – despite threats of eviction, alleged beatings from police and an international outcry by homeless charities and migrant help groups – so many insisted they would stay for as long as it takes to get to England. As one teenage Eritrean put it: ‘We will get there eventually.’ The new Jungle is situated on the seaward side of a road used by lorries heading to the port. It is a swathe of wasteland and sand dunes, owned and used by a chemical factory to bury supposedly non-toxic waste. Many of the migrants are men in their twenties, sometimes accompanied by women and children. They spend nights under canvas with no drinking water or sanitary facilities – then attempt to leap on UK bound trucks about to board ferries. Others attempt to cut their way into trailers at truckers’ cafés, where drivers rest before crossing to the UK. Large numbers of Africans started to arrive after being evicted from squats in Calais and random camps on the outskirts of town, joining Afghans, Iraqis and Pakistanis evicted from previous camps. They were among thousands of migrants who have risked their lives crossing the Mediterranean to reach Europe and a better life. Many have perished either from drowning or suffocation on overcrowded fishing boats they sailed in. Luckier ones were rescued by the Italian navy after their boats got into difficulties near the island of Lampedusa, 100 miles from Sicily. Six suspected illegal migrants were caught by police after smuggling themselves into Britain in a shipment of new Maseratis. Officers were involved in a dramatic chase at a motorway service station after the men climbed out of the sports cars and tried to run. The would-be migrants from Sudan had hidden themselves inside the Maseratis, which can cost as much as £110,000, on the back of a transporter. Six suspected illegal migrants were caught by police after smuggling themselves into Britain in a shipment of new Maseratis . They escaped detection because the Italian-made cars were covered in protective fabric sleeves which can be unzipped. But when the lorry driver parked up at Cobham Services on the M25 in Surrey yesterday the men tried to make a run for it. It is not known when the men hid themselves in the sports cars. They were handed over to immigration officials, who will assess whether they have a right to remain here. Yesterday, a water pipe to a factory sports hall, tapped into by migrants for their water supply, was cut off. They now have to rely on bottles of mineral water brought by aid workers to drink and wash themselves. Sixteen-year-old Eritrean girls Almas and Halan told the Daily Mail they had taken months to reach Calais from their homeland. ‘We both want to learn, to study commercial sciences in England,’ said Almas. Sixteen-year-old Eritrean girls Almas (left) and Halan (right) said they had taken months to reach Calais from their Eritrea . Eritreans and Ethiopean migrants camp in the grounds of a chemical factory in Calais. The encampment has been dubbed Jungle 2 . ‘We just want a life. We left Eritrea because there was no life for us there. We will eventually reach England but we have no money to pay people smugglers to get us on to lorries so we will just carry on trying to stow away.’ There are numbers of Sudanese at the camp, as well as some Afghans whose tents are pitched away from the Africans. Arrested migrants are usually released after several hours. Ed Balls has admitted Labour can’t win the next election unless it becomes tougher on immigration. The Shadow Chancellor said Europe’s freedom of movement rules needed to be reformed. His intervention comes amid growing concern among senior Labour figures that the party could lose votes to Ukip in May’s election. Mr Balls said Labour would seek to toughen up laws which allow EU citizens to enter Britain with few restrictions. He said the party could not afford to look ‘out of touch’ on immigration if it was to have a chance of victory. In an interview with the Telegraph, he also refused to rule out new taxes to fund social care or the NHS, saying people ‘rightly feel they pay too much tax already’. He added: ‘If we are going to win the next election, which I think we can, on jobs and the NHS and standing up for people on low and middle incomes against an out-of-touch government, then we cannot look out of touch on an issue that people really care about.’ In some cases they are deported, usually to Belgium as migrants claim that their point of entry into the EU was in that country. The migrants then return the few miles from Belgium to resume attempts to stow away to Britain. Calais authorities insisted migrants would be evicted from the camp ‘imminently’. A police spokesman likened the job of controlling increasingly angry and frustrated migrants to ‘trying to empty an ocean with a teaspoon’. Meanwhile, another night of opportunity beckoned for those trying to smuggle themselves to Britain.

"Derya Sert from Anamur in Southern Turke was the first person to have a womb transplant. She is looking forward to having IVF . Britain’s first womb transplant could be carried out in just two years. Surgeons in London are on the verge of perfecting the procedure that will allow childless women to carry their own babies. Richard Smith, who plans to carry out the pioneering op, says it could provide a ‘ray of light’ for the 15,000 young British women of childbearing age who were born without a womb or had it removed due to illness. However, critics question whether giving a woman the chance to experience the joy of pregnancy is worth ‘experimenting’ on an unborn child. Mr Smith, a consultant gynaecological surgeon at the Lister Hospital in west London, has spent almost 15 years researching the subject and today launches the charity Uterine Transplant UK to raise the £500,000 needed for the first five ops. A womb has only been transplanted successfully once before, in Turkey last August. But the recipient has not yet become pregnant. Derya Sert, who is due to start IVF in September in the hope of conceiving a much longed-for child, recently told the Daily Mail: ‘If I had a magic wand, I would want to be pregnant now. I just want to hold my baby in my arms, to be a mother.’ Mr Smith, of charity Uterine Transplant UK, is using a similar technique to the Turkish surgeons but says his work has been delayed by lack of funding. He has already ploughed significant amounts of his own money into the quest and hopes the appeal will attract donations from medical charities and members of the public. He has already done successful womb transplants in rabbits and one became pregnant, although it later miscarried. More work on rabbits and then on sheep is planned. If successful, the operation could be carried out on a British woman in as little as two years. Danger: Fertility expert Lord Winston says the risks are not worth taking. Surrogacy is an alternative option . Mr Smith has already been approached by more than 50 women. The candidate for surgery would be between 20 and 40 and born without a womb or had it removed due to illness. The woman would have ovaries and so be able to produce eggs, will be given a womb from a dead donor in a four-hour operation. Powerful immunosuppressant drugs will prevent the new womb from being rejected and six months to a year later, the woman will be given IVF to become pregnant. Any baby will have to delivered by caesarean section because the new tissue will not stand up to a natural birth. The woman is likely to be at extra risk of a host of complications of pregnancy, as well as miscarrying or having a premature birth. The process does not end there. Long-term risks of disease and side effects from the anti-rejection drugs mean the new womb will need to be taken out again after one or two pregnancies. Currently, such women have their options limited to remaining childless, adoption or surrogacy. Eleanor Findlater, who had a hysterectomy due to cancer said she would have had a womb transplant 'in a second' if it had been available . Eleanor Findlater had a hysterectomy within months of being . married - and would have had a womb transplant in a second. Mrs Findlater was just 32 when she was diagnosed with a rare . form of cancer of the womb and had the lifesaving hysterectomy. She said: ‘I had just been married for six months, I’d . always wanted children and I was absolutely devastated.’ After deciding against adoption because of the length of . time it would take, the Findlaters settled on surrogacy. They now have two boys, aged four and five, who are . genetically their own and were carried by the same surrogate mother. Mrs Findlater, who is now 40 and lives in London where she . is setting up a business, says that she has no regrets about the route she . chose – but would have opted for a womb transplant had it . been available. She said: ‘Surrogacy was the most fantastic experience but I . would have had a womb transplant in a second. ‘I would have done what it took to carry a baby, if the . option had been there.’ Although surrogacy would allow them to have a child that is genetically their own, it is banned in some countries and legally and ethically fraught in others. Mr Smith said: ‘In many women, there is a deep yearning to carry children and this is not fulfilled by surrogacy. ‘I’ve had my own crisis with this project over the years, are we doing the right thing? ‘But when you meet women in this position, I know in my heart of hearts that if we do it safely, it is the right thing.’ He added that by 2020, the procedure could be routine enough and inexpensive enough for use on the NHS. Not everyone agrees. Fertility expert Lord Winston says the risks are not worth taking and some women have to accept they won’t become mothers. And the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has reservations about the welfare of the mother and of the child. Professor Charles Kingsland, a consultant gynaecologist and RCOG spokesman, said: ‘Significant concerns need to be addressed to everybody’s satisfaction before we go ahead and offer this as a viable option.’",Consultant Richard Smith says procedure could be routine enough and inexpensive enough for use on the NHS by 2020 .
"Suing: Christopher Dietz says his construction business has lost $300,000 over the negative review on Yelp . A judge in Virginia has ordered a woman to change her negative Yelp review about a building contractor after the business won a key legal battle. Jane Perez was slapped with a $750,000 . lawsuit by Dietz Development after she publicly logged complaints about . construction work the company performed on her home. In her write-ups on the popular business . review sites Yelp and Angie's List, Perez accused the company of . damaging her house, trespassing and stealing jewelry. On Wednesday, Judge Thomas FortKort granted a temporary injunction in favor of Dietz Development and ordered Perez to change parts of her online review to remove the reference to the stolen jewelry. 'I found my jewelry missing and Dietz was the only one with a key,' Perez wrote in the review. A police investigation found no connection between the missing jewelry and Dietz or his company. Perez was also ordered to change a reference to a previous lawsuit filed by Dietz because it included incorrect legal terminology. James T Bacon, Perez's attorney, told MailOnline that ruling amounted to the judge 'copy editing' Perez's online review. 'Obviously this is very chilling to free speech because folks are going to be very concerned and afraid to voice their opinions about businesses,' he said. 'We believe that these sites are the forum where we should be encouraged to write about our experiences with businesses.' Review: Perez posted a negative review on the popular site Yelp, as well as Angie's List, another business review site . Dietz lawyer, though, said the ruling aims to correct ongoing harm to Dietz's reputation that he has suffered from from false accusations. 'A bad review is one thing. But, it was a bad review that accused him of theft. And in this residential construction, commercial construction business - that’s a devastating accusation,' attorney Milton Johns said. Christopher Dietz, the owner of Dietz . Development, said he had no choice but to file the lawsuit after he lost . $300,00 when customers fled his business over the review, reports The Washington Post. 'The impact has been awful,' Dietz said. 'There is no one to protect businesses when people slam their name.' Johns said the case is not about free speech, it's about taking a stand about using lies to defame a local business. Allegations: Perez claims her townhouse in Falls Church, Virginia, (pictured) was damaged by the work Dietz did . 'Defamation has never been protected by the First Amendment,' he said. Perez's lawyer, Mr Bacon, maintains that everything in the review is demonstrably true and that the judge took issue with only a tiny portion of what she posted online. Perez is only the latest online critic to find herself in court over negative comments post online. Jane Perez isn't the only Yelp reviewer to be sued after writing bad things about a business online. Free speech advocates say such cases are on the rise. In . 2009, a San Francisco man was sued by a chiropractor after he posted a . Yelp review accusing the business of over-charging him. That suit was settled out of court. A . Chicago plastic surgeon sued three women in 2010 after they wrote . online accusations that he gave them disfigured and misshapen breasts . after surgery. In September, a Pilates studio in . Virginia sued two Yelp reviewers who complained that the business . smelled like mildew and that the staff was unfriendly. Perez, a retired captain in the military, said she never thought she could be sued over something as common as a Yelp review. 'I don’t want to see what happened to me happen to anyone else,' Perez said. The stakes in the world of online reviews are increasingly high. Yelp . is primarily known for restaurant reviews, but it has branched out to . include listings and customer evaluations for businesses of all kinds. It has become a review powerhouse, with 84million visitors a month and 33million reviews. A . 2011 Harvard University study suggested that for each star a restaurant . received on from reviewers on the site, the restaurant owners could . expect a 5 to 7percent jump in revenue. This is the text of Perez's original review posted on Angie's List in August 2012. The bolded portions must be removed from the review after a judge granted a temporary injunction. Overall: F . Price: F . Quality: F . Responsiveness: F . Punctuality: F . Professionalism: F . Description Of Work: Dietz Development was to perform: painting, refinish floors, electrical, plumbing and handyman work. I was instead left with damage to my home and work that had to be reaccomplished for thousands more than originally estimated. Member comments: My home was damaged' the ""work"" had to be re-accomplished; and Dietz tried to sue me for ""monies due for his ""work."" I won in summary judgement (meaning that his case had no merit). Despite his claims, Dietz was/is not licensed to perform work in the state of VA. Further, he invoiced me for work not even performed and also sued me for work not even performed. Today (six months later) he just showed up at my door and '""wanted to talk to me."" I said that I ""didn't want to talk to him,"" closed the door , and called the police. (The police said his reason was that he had a ""lien on my house""; however this ""lien"" was made null and void the day I won the case according to the court.) This is after filing my first ever police report when I found my jewelry missing and Dietz was the only one with a key.

"Convicted: Lisa Biron (pictured) faces at least 25 years in jail after being found guilty of abducting a teenage girl to Canada and forcing her to have sex on camera . A jury took less than an hour to convict a female lawyer who worked with an anti-gay Christian group for abducting a teenage girl and forcing her to have sex on camera while on bail for child pornography charges. Lisa Biron, 43, did not display any emotion as the verdict was read during the January court appearance in New Hampshire. She faces a minimum 25 year sentenced when she is sentenced later this month. 'It was just very difficult, and I don't think I should say much more than that,' juror Peter Evans told a local television station. 'The evidence was pretty overwhelming, and the decision, I'm sure, was accurate.' Biron was arrested by FBI agents in a Manchester courtroom while awaiting a hearing on district-level charges of possessing pornographic material on her computer. A few hours later, she was taken into a court in Concord, New Hampshire, accused of taking the teenage girl to Canada, making her engage in sexual activity and convincing her to let it be filmed. Biron, who is associated with the anti-gay group Alliance Defending Freedom, was initially arrested after a man walked into the Manchester Police Department claiming he had seen pornography on her computer. After a search of her computer, police found five videos and two pictures of a teenage girl on her computer. Biron was released on bail on seven charges of possessing child pornography earlier this month. After her arrest by the FBI, she allegedly told agents they would find a loaded pistol under her mattress. They didn't find a weapon, but they did discover 200 rounds of ammunition in her Manchester home. At the hearing on federal-level charges, the prosecutor also alleged that: . Charged: Biron was arrested by FBI agents at a Manchester court (above) while awaiting a hearing on district-level charges of possessing pornographic material on her computer . Biron's lawyer, Jim Moir, asked the judge to consider his clients lack of criminal history and that she had attended all of her court appearances, according to the Concord Monitor. But Judge Landya McCafferty remanded her in custody after saying she was 'not at all comfortable' that she would comply with any new bail conditions. She is due to stand trial in January on the federal charges of transportation with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, possession of child pornography and five counts of sexual exploitation of children. She faces up to life in prison if convicted. Biron, who was briefly associated with the Donais Law Offices in Manchester before her arrest, has been suspended indefinitely.

"'Carying and funny': Joy Williams, 23, died on october 23 after travelling to Bangkok for buttock augmentation surgery . The family of a British girl who died while having cut-price plastic surgery in Thailand have revealed that they didn't know she had gone abroad. Joy Williams, 23, from Thamesmead, was described as a 'caring and funny' girl who was 'loved by everybody. She died on October 23 after travelling to Bangkok to have £2,000 buttock augmentation surgery. Speaking yesterday from his home in Lagos, Nigeria, Miss Williams's older brother Anietie, 28, said he had been looking forward to her visiting him in Nigeria this Christmas. He said: 'We don't really know what went wrong, we only know what is in reports in the media. 'She was a very nice and caring person. 'She brought joy to people's lives. 'She was a beautiful girl, loved by everybody. We will miss her so much.' He added that the family were still making preparations to bring Miss Williams's body home and that his brother was planning to fly to Thailand and return to London with it. Miss Williams, who was born in Lagos, settled in Thamesmead with her mother Christie in 2007 and had been to Thailand twice before choosing to visit for surgery. She initially visitied to the SP clinic, which she found on the internet, on October 14 to have the operation which she hoped would give her a bigger, fuller bottom. A few days later her wounds became infected and she returned to have corrective surgery to remove the silicon implants. But she was found dead on the operating table with a three inch-long stitched incision on her tail bone after medical staff found they were unable to resuscitate her. Thai officials investigating her death believe her operation had been delayed to ensure Miss Williams had not eaten anything beforehand and that as a result the operation began after the clinic's legal closing time of 7pm. It is believed Miss Williams had long struggled with her self-esteem and been bullied at school before choosing to undergo an operation on her nose to improve her looks. Scroll down for video . Doctor Sompob Sansiri claimed to have trained in the U.S. and been practicing since 1998, but he is now facing ten years behind bars . Doctor Sompob Sansiri, 51, is lead away by police after Miss Williams died at his clinic . While in Bangkok she had been staying at the £11-a-night Vabua Asotel hotel which is used by the clinic as accommodation for its patients.

Solange Magnano (right), 38, was rushed to hospital with severe breathing problems after the cosmetic operation. The mother of eight-year-old twins died from a blocked lung artery after spending three days in a critical condition in intensive care. Denise Hendry, wife of former football star Colin Hendry, also died as the result of a liposuction operation in which the surgeon punctured her bowel nine times. She suffered a heart attack, multiple organ failure and blood poisoning, and spent five weeks in a coma. She survived the initial operation, but was forced to undergo 18 operations to fix her bowel. She died seven years later, aged just 42. The doctor who carried out the procedure, Sompob Sansiri, 51, was later arrested and accused of negligence after it was found that he had been carrying out night-time surgery without a licence. He has now been charged with recklessness causing death and could face 10 years in jail if found guilty. The clinic has been closed for 60 days while investigations are carried out.

"The Brooklyn District Attorney has released a list of the 45 men and a woman convicted since a clampdown on sex abuse within its ultra-Orthodox Jewish community was launched four years ago. DA Charles Hynes, who is running for re-election in the New York district, released their identities in an apparent U-turn on his previous policy of not naming perverts for fear victims might suffer intimidation or that others may be deterred from coming forward. The most high-profile case saw religious counsellor Nechemya Weberman, 54, sentenced to 103-years in prison for molesting a girl, beginning when she was 12-years old. Predator: The most high-profile case saw religious counsellor Nechemya Weberman, 54, sentenced to 103-years in prison for molesting a girl, beginning when she was 12-years old . 'We feel now it’s good for the community to know those who have been convicted,' Hynes' spokesman told the New York Post. There were originally 118 cases viewed by NYPD detectives under operation Kol Tzedek, Hebrew for 'voice of justice'. Of those, 25 sex offenders were jailed. Victory: DA Charles Hynes released their identities in an apparent U-turn on his previous policy of not naming perverts for fear victims might suffer intimidation or that others may be deterred from coming forward . Others included 33 felonies, 13 misdemeanors while the only convicted woman was sentenced to 3 and a half years in prison for sexually abusing her son. The sentences are a major victory for Hynes and the city of New York where securing convictions in Orthodox Jewish communities can be difficult because many fear being ostracized if speak out about abuse. At least 10 cases were dismissed and seven downgraded because victims backed out or parents refused to let their children testify. But prosecutors believe victims have gained courage since predators like Weberman - whose supporters allegedly tried to bribe the victim and threaten her boyfriend’s business - have been jailed. Weberman, 54, who worked as an unlicensed therapist in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, was sentenced in January following an emotional testimony by his victim, now aged 18. ‘I clearly remember how I would look in the mirror. I saw a girl who didn’t want to live in her own skin, a girl whose innocence was shattered, a girl who couldn’t sleep at night because of the gruesome invasion that had been done to her body,’ the accuser told the court. She said she was ‘a sad girl who . wanted to live a normal life but instead was being victimized by a . 50-year-old man who forced her to perform sickening acts again and . again.’ She had testified that . Weberman abused her repeatedly behind his locked office door from the . time she was 12 until she was 15. Weberman was convicted last month on all . 59 counts, including sustained sexual abuse of a child, endangering the . welfare of a child and sexual abuse. The trial put a spotlight on the ultra-orthodox community in Brooklyn and its strict rules that govern clothing, social customs and interaction with the outside world. Both Weberman, 54, and the accuser belonged to the Satmar Hasidic sect. Locked away: The victim testified that from the time she was 12-years-old until she was 15 Weberman abused her behind his locked office door . Reaction: Like Weberman, his wife Chaya Golda Weberman, seen arriving at the Brooklyn Supreme Court on Tuesday, showed no emotion to his sentencing . The teen and her family have been . harassed and ostracized, reflecting long-held beliefs that any conflict . must be dealt with from within. During the trial, men were arrested on charges they tried to bribe the accuser and her now-husband to drop the case. Others were accused of snapping photos of her on the witness stand and posting them online. She expressed hope that by coming forward, she could give strength to other victims of sexual abuse. Her school had ordered her to see . Weberman because she had been asking questions about her religion and . was dressing immodestly in violation of the sect’s customs, and it was . believed she needed to be helped back on the right path. Weberman wasn’t a licensed counselor but spent decades working with couples and families in his community. There was no physical evidence of abuse. The court received dozens of letters from supporters of the defendant who described his life in the community as a counselor and a father. Community support: Seen last May among other members of Williamsburg's community, the court received dozens of letters from his supporters who described his life in the community as a wholesome counselor and a father . ‘Nechemya Weberman is innocent of the crimes charged,’ defense attorney George Farkas insisted at the sentencing. On Tuesday Weberman said ‘no thank . you’ when asked if he wished to speak. He and his wife had no visible . reaction to the sentence. The top charge carried a sentence of 25 years; . he got consecutive terms for some of the other charges. The . defense argued that the girl was angry that Weberman had told her . parents she had a boyfriend at the age of 15 which is forbidden in her . community. They claimed the girl went to police . only after Weberman and her parents set up hidden cameras to secretly . record the girl having sex with her boyfriend when she was still . underage. Weberman turned the tapes over to police in the hopes that the boyfriend would be prosecuted. The charges against the boyfriend were later dropped.","Nechemya Weberman, 54, sentenced to 103-years for molesting a girl, 12 .

"Stand: Crown chief prosecutor for the north west Nazir Afzal, pictured, has admitted the exploitation of white girls is an 'Asian problem' The sexual exploitation and grooming of young vulnerable white girls is a 'particular problem in Asian communities', one of Britain's top prosecutors admitted for the first time today. In a year when several paedophile gangs were convicted of raping and prostituting victims in north west England, Nazir Afzal says it is impossible not to notice 'that the perpetrators were Asian and the victims were not.' The Chief Crown Prosecutor for the region added that 'cultural baggage and the status of women among some men in these communities contributes to their disrespect for the rights of women.' It was claimed last month that fears they would be branded racist meant that police and social services left one group free to rape up to 50 white girls, and Mr Afzal said today he would not 'turn a blind eye.' It came as the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee announced yesterday a day of evidence next week because its members and  chairman Keith Vaz are 'very concerned by the recent cases of child exploitation.' The Labour MP for Leicester East has previously said: 'I do not think it is a race issue.' In these disturbing recent cases most victims were white, aged between 13 and 16, many were from vulnerable backgrounds or the care system, and the majority were plied with booze and drugs before being systematically abused. Speaking to The Times today Mr Afzal said: 'Exploitation happens in every community but these cases demonstrate that group grooming is a particular problem in Asian community. I will not turn a blind eye to crimes in any community.' He spoke out as two Asian men, Mahfuzur Rahman and Abdul Hannan, were convicted of raping or sexually assaulting four young white women in their area after they picked them up and got them drunk. In an originally botched prosecution in 2009, victims gave detailed evidence about being violently raped by Rahman before charges were dropped because evidence was said to lack credibility. Once the case was abandoned, Rahman was free to target a 17-year-old from a nearby children's home, plying her with vodka before sexually assaulting her at his flat. His other victims were also violently raped or assaulted while very drunk. Disgusting In the Rochdale case the abuse began at two takeaways in the Heywood . area, including the Balti House (pictured), which is under . new ownership . And when he was finally arrested and charged with rape again last year individuals close to the case said Rahman told officers: 'Rape? Which one?' While last month a sex grooming gang of nine were all jailed, and two set to be deported, after they plied teenagers . with alcohol before abusing them in Rochdale, . Greater Manchester. The men - who are all from Pakistan, apart from one who is from Afghanistan - groomed and 'shared' the young white girls because they were vulnerable, and abused them above takeaways and shops. But during the trial it came out that the authorities could have stopped them two years . before their sickening crimes were finally uncovered. In an interview with MailOnline last month Former Labour MP for Keighley Ann Cryer, who has campaigned on the issue of Asian sex gangs and also preventing forced marriage, . said that the authorities did ignore complaints in this case because they . were 'petrified of being called racist'. 'Forces have been accused of being institutionally racist. That sort of thing sticks,' she added. 'If . you do say things like that about any police force then they will be . majorly careful to avoid being being put in line for criticism like . that. It may well be that they then steer clear of the tragic events . that we are talking about. All because they want to be politically correct.' Trophy: Victim Toni-Marie Redfern was initially flattered by the attention she received from Abid Mohammed Saddique but was then kept prisoner by them . Pretty teenager Toni-Marie Redfern . thought she’d found the perfect boyfriend. Polite, handsome, and seven . years her senior, he drove a silver BMW, wore designer suits and bought . her dinner at her favourite pizza café. No wonder her schoolfriends were envious. And when he asked her to marry him, she started to make plans for their future. Yet Toni-Marie eventually learned the truth about Abid Mohammed Saddique. While . they were going out, the British-born man of Pakistani origin was . orchestrating what is believed to be the biggest sex-abuse ring ever . discovered in Britain, involving up to 100 young girls. Last year, Saddique and his accomplice, Mohammed Liaqat, whose Derby-based . gang groomed girls (most of whom were white and aged between 12 and 18) for sex, were jailed for bringing a ‘reign of terror’ to the North . Midlands city. A court . heard how the pair — who had undergone arranged marriages in Pakistan — . cruised the streets in a BMW or a Range Rover, which Saddique referred . to as the ‘Rape Rover’. Girls . were ‘chatted up’ on the street and invited for drives, during which . they were plied with vodka or cocaine before being taken to hotel rooms, . parks or houses to be abused. Key to the men’s conviction was . Toni-Marie, now 20, who bravely gave evidence against her ex-lover. ‘When I discovered what he . had done to those girls, I felt physically sick. He was the puppet . master and all his mates were his puppets. Everyone did whatever he told . them to do,' she said. ‘I was a white girl who he wanted to . control and prove that he could convert to Islam. I saw him and the gang . tell non-Muslim girls they were “slags”. I believe it was the religion . and culture of these men that made them act like that. ‘In one of the last conversations I had . with him, he referred to his Land Rover as the “Rape Rover”. That is . when I knew I had to escape. I’d had enough.’","After a spate of cases Nazir Afzal says it is impossible not to notice 'that the perpetrators were Asian and the victims were not'

"If you thought you had to cut out pizza when it comes to a diet, think again. This one claims to be better for you than a salad. Created by a professor of human nutrition, it is billed as the world’s healthiest pizza – and the only ready meal that is nutritionally balanced. The Eat Balanced pizza, which comes in three flavours, incorporates vitamin and mineral-rich ingredients such as ground seaweed and red pepper into its flour base and tomato sauce. Scroll down for video . Dieting alternative: The Eat Balanced pizza claims to be healthier than a salad . Hidden ingredients: The pizzas are so to contain all 47 nutrients that human body needs in the right amounts . The range was dreamt up by obesity expert Professor Mike Lean amid concerns that supermarket ready meals and pizzas fail to meet our body’s demands. For instance, many pizzas are high in salt and fat but lack vital vitamins and minerals. Vitamin C, in particular, is likely to be low. In contrast the frozen Eat Balanced pizzas, which went on sale in England and Wales this week, have been carefully created to contain each of the 47 nutrients essential for health – and in the right amounts. Professor Lean, who spoke at the European Congress on Obesity in Liverpool, this week, said: ‘This is the only nutritionally-balanced ready meal anywhere. ‘Nobody has previously designed a meal which has got everything in the right proportions.  I’m pretty proud of it.’ Analysis shows the pizzas, which cost around £3.50, to be healthier than shop-bought salads. Variety: The pizzas come in three flavours and were designed as an alternative to unhealthy ready meals . Shop-bought salads tend to be low in . protein and high in carbohydrates and fat, while a range of key vitamins . and minerals are missing all together. Professor . Lean, of Glasgow University, said: ‘Find me a salad that matches up to . the Eat Balanced pizza.  I haven’t  been able to find one yet.’ To . turn a pizza into a perfect meal, the professor brainstormed with . Donnie Maclean, an entrepreneur looking for new business ventures. Mr Maclean came up with the idea of using seaweed, collected from Hebridean beaches, to provide the vitamins and minerals missing from the average pizza. The seaweed, which is ground up and added to the part-wholemeal flour base, is rich in iron, zinc, vitamin B 12 and iodine. Its gritty taste also means that only a tiny amount of salt need be added to the mix. To make a pizza with vitamin C, the pair added a tiny amount of ground red pepper to the tomato sauce. Tomatoes are low in the vitamin but it is plentiful in red peppers. The cheese used is simply normal mozzarella and the calorie count is 600 – roughly a third of a person’s daily intake. Each pizza also contains roughly a third of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient needed for health and tests have had positive results. Professor Lean said: ‘You are not sitting on the seats of Sorrento eating it. It is a frozen pizza but it tastes, smells and looks as good as any other frozen pizza.’ At around £3.50 it is, however, slightly more expensive than some other 9-inch pizzas. The Eat Balanced range has been on sale in Scotland for several months and has just become available to English and Welsh shoppers, through Ocado. Those who are tempted will be glad to know that they can eat three of the pizzas a day and be perfectly nutritionally balanced. Dieters, however should limit themselves to two pizzas. Dr Maria Bryant, of the UK Association for the Study of Obesity, warned that seaweed is an acquired taste. She added: ‘I support the move towards improving existing foods that are very popular but I am not sure that eating two or three pizzas a day would be the best approach.’","Eat Balanced pizzas designed by professor of nutrition .

"The U.S. Army's last Vietnam-era draftee has retired after 42 years of active service. New York native Chief Warrant Officer 5 Ralph Rigby received a standing ovation at his retirement ceremony on October 28 at Camp Red Cloud in South Korea. The special occasion also coincided with his 62nd birthday. The machinery maintenance expert now plans to move back to America and settle in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Fond farewell: New York native Chief Warrant Officer 5 Ralph Rigby received a standing ovation at his retirement ceremony on October 28 at Camp Red Cloud in South Korea . Rigby was drafted into the Army in 1972 when he was 19 years old during the Vietnam era. However, he was fortunate to not have to deploy there. Instead, after training at Fort Dix, New Jersey, Rigby was sent to the Army’s engineer school at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. His first assignment then took him to Kwachon, South Korea. He enjoyed his time there so much that he extended his tour. Over the years he has served at various levels, from power generator equipment repairman to platoon sergeant to ground support maintenance technician. Double celebration: The special occasion also coincided with his 62nd birthday . Final touches: Rigby carefully places his ribbon together one last time on his uniform the night before his retirement ceremony . In his final role, he served as the senior ordnance logistics officer for the 2nd Infantry at Camp Red Cloud, South Korea. Commenting on his lengthy military career, Rigby told Staff Sgt. Reshema Sherlock: 'I love what I do. 'The Army has allowed me to travel and see things that I would have never seen otherwise.' Maj. Gen. Thomas Vandal, the 2nd Infantry’s commanding general, thanked Rigby for his service at his retirement service. Dedicated: Rigby mans a mounted M60 during a patrol in Afghanistan's Paptika province in July 2004 - No other individual in the unit had been trained on the legacy weapon, so Rigby volunteered for the mission . 'Chief, you have truly been a bargain for the American people and our Army, a giver who has sacrificed much for the sake of our nation,' Vandal said. In July 2011, the Army announced that Command Sgt. Maj. Jeff Mellinger was retiring as the service's last Vietnam-era draftee. But Army officials later had to issue a correction when they learned Rigby and another soldier also were drafted and remained on active duty. The other soldier, Chief Warrant Officer 4 Franklin Ernst, retired in 2012.

"Jason Festerman faces jail for spraying the foul smelling liquid stink bomb at his son's school. He claims he was testing the pump .

"A fanatical terrorist has escaped being thrown out of the UK because it would breach his human rights. Hate-filled Siraj Yassin Abdullah . Ali, graded the highest possible risk to the public, was released after . serving just half of his nine-year sentence for helping the July 21 . bombers. He now mingles freely among the Londoners his co-plotters tried to kill six years ago. Threat: Siraj Yassin Abdullah Ali has been using public transport . Government officials are desperate to . deport the Islamic fundamentalist back to his native Eritrea but have . been told they cannot because he could face ‘inhumane treatment or . punishment’. Ali was convicted of helping a gang . of five Al Qaeda suicide bombers in their bid to repeat the carnage of . the attacks of July 7, 2005, two weeks later. Graham Foulkes, whose 22-year-old son David was killed on July 7, said he was ‘filled with despair’. He said: ‘These people were plotting to commit mass murder - what about the human rights of victims and families? ‘These people had no consideration . for the women and children they were trying to kill. How can they claim . we should look after and support them?’ Accomplice: Siraj Yassin Abdullah Ali knew about the terrorist plot and failed to tell the authorities . The case is the latest to highlight . how human rights laws have left the authorities powerless to remove some . terrorists and convicted criminals. Imposed human rights laws have left . the authorities powerless to remove some terrorists and convicted . criminals. Imposed by unaccountable European judges, they place the . rights of the most dangerous wrongdoers above the risks faced by . ordinary people. The five would-be suicide bombers . were jailed for life after trying to detonate bombs at Shepherd’s Bush, . Warren Street and Oval Tube stations and on a bus in Shoreditch. Thwarted: Terrorist Ramzi Mohammed is chased by passengers at Oval Station after he had attempted to detonate a bomb during the failed attack on July 21, 2005 . Ali, 35, knew about the potentially murderous July 21 conspiracy and helped the fanatics clear up their explosives factory. He was jailed for 12 years in  February 2008 for aiding and  abetting the Al Qaeda cell. Judge Paul Worsley QC said he must have ‘harboured the hope’ the bombers would ‘destroy society as we know it’. The sentence was reduced to nine years on appeal and after time Ali spent in jail while awaiting trial was taken into account, he was automatically released on licence several weeks ago. He is now living at a bail hostel on a leafy residential street in north-west London. He has been seen travelling on the Tube and catching buses. With music headphones plugged into his ears and a bag slung casually across his shoulder, he appeared to be caught on camera chatting on a mobile phone. It is understood that Ali is being monitored around the clock and must obey a curfew and other conditions, including a ban on using the internet. He is the second high-risk terrorist linked to the July 21 attacks to win the right to remain in the UK on human rights grounds in recent weeks. Still here: Ismail Abdurahman  also helped the July 21 plotters and has since escaped deportation . Ismail Abdurahman, 28, who hid would-be bomber Hussain Osman for three days, escaped being deported to his native Somalia after judges feared for his safety. Abdurahman is also living at a bail hostel in London despite the protests of police and Home Office officials. The release of Ali and Abdurahman underlines the challenges faced by police, probation and MI5.  There are fears that they will be stretched to the limit as they try to monitor dozens of freed fanatics in the run-up to the Olympics next year. Research by one think-tank found that more than 230 people have been convicted of terrorist offences since 2001, but only around 100 remain in prison. Under Article 3 of both the European Convention on Human Rights, and Labour’s Human Rights Act, individuals are protected against torture, inhuman or degrading treatment. The clause allows foreign terror suspects to fight deportation on the grounds that they would be tortured in their home countries if returned. In February, Lord Carlile warned that European judges have turned Britain into a ‘safe haven’ for foreign terrorists. Appalling legislation: Tory MP Pritti Patel says the law needs to be changed . Tory MP Priti Patel said: ‘This is yet another example of how we have got to abolish this appalling human rights legislation that allows terrorists and violent criminals to waltz out of prison and stay in our country. ‘They should be deported instantly back to where they came from.’ Solicitor Cliff Tibber, who represents the families of several July 7 victims, said: ‘There is no doubt it is uncomfortable for the families to see someone like this back on the streets after what feels like an extremely short period of time.’ A UK Border Agency spokesman said: ‘We will do everything we can to remove this individual from the UK and are extremely disappointed by the court’s decision to grant bail, which we vigorously opposed. ‘In the meantime, we are working closely with public protection agencies to ensure that appropriate monitoring is in place.’ A Ministry of Justice spokesman insisted that public protection remains ‘top priority’ and that serious offenders face ‘strict’ controls and conditions. ANALYSIS by JAMES SLACK . Such is the perversity of human rights law that the worse the crime, the easier it is for the culprit to dodge deportation. This is particularly true when countries with a history of ill-treatment and torture, such as Eritrea and Somalia, are involved. The British government will at least try to persuade the courts to send the convict back home. Flashback: A London double-decker bus targeted by bombers during the 7/7 attack. A judge said the failed 21/7 bomb plot could have caused even more carnage . But, when the foreign prisoner appeals, he will say that the gravity of his offence means he now has notoriety back home, and that he therefore will be a marked man to his homeland’s security services. Routinely, prisoners claim they will be met from the plane and immediately tortured. The British courts normally agree not to deport them – creating the bizarre situation where a terrorist or a killer has more chance of being allowed to stay in the UK than a foreign shoplifter or a simple failed asylum seeker. Siraj Yassin Abdullah Ali certainly falls into the category of being an evil man, given that he knew of the July 21 bomb plot, but did nothing to alert the authorities. Chilling evidence: A handwritten note detailing the make-up of devices used during the 21/7 bomb attack found in Siraj Yassin Abdullah Ali's flat . He was brought up in the same foster family as July 21 conspirator Yassin Omar, and lived in the flat directly above Omar’s eighth-floor bomb factory. He was also a close friend of  ringleader Muktar Said Ibrahim,  who had a key to his flat and often stayed there. Ali housed the members of the plot when the fumes in Omar’s bomb factory became overwhelming, and helped with the clear-up afterwards. At Ali’s home, police found handwritten documents relating to the construction of the bombs ripped up in his waste paper bin. On one piece of paper were the words ‘detonator, charge and Allah’ in Arabic. The second man linked to July 21 who is using human rights law to dodge deportation, Ismail Abdurahman, showed a similar hatred for the British public. The Somalian provided a safe house for Shepherd’s Bush bomber Hussain Osman before he fled the country on July 26, 2005. He also acted as a ‘runner’, retrieving a video camera and passport for Osman. The camera was apparently used to record suicide messages. The judge who jailed five men convicted of helping the bombers, including Ali and Abdurahman, said they had shown no remorse. Paul Worsley, QC, said: ‘You concealed your knowledge of the would-be bombers who were set to inflict even greater devastation than that of 7/7 which claimed the lives of 52 innocents. ‘You then helped them escape justice, leaving them free to strike again.’ It is a bitter irony that human rights judges have now decided that – regardless of the enormity of their crimes – they should be free to stay in Britain for good.","Eritrean-born Ali will not face deportation because judges rule he could face 'inhumane treatment'

Rooney's wife Coleen, pictured left, and son Kai, pictured right, had travelled to South America to watch the star and saw him score his first ever World Cup goal . Hundreds of supporters went to Newcastle Airport in the early hours of the morning to cheer the England players when they flew in after beating Germany 5-1 in 2001. The big four north-west clubs Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City and Everton supplied more than half of England's squad and among those also disembarking at Manchester after the long flight from Rio were  James Milner, Chris Smalling, Ricky Lambert, Glen Johnson, Danny Welbeck. Ross Barkley, Jordan Henderson, Danny Welbeck and Raheem Sterling. England’s already-sealed fate appears to have led to a slump in viewing for their last match of the World Cup, with less than half the audience of the previous game tuning in. Maybe Qatar eh Joe?

Harsh, but funny: Bookmaker Paddypower's banner quips: 'At least try and maker it through baggage reclaim' Yesterday’s 0-0 draw with Costa Rica managed to pull in an audience which at its height was more than 9 million, with an average of 5.8 million watching throughout ITV’s coverage. But it was a sharp drop on the numbers who saw the clash with Uruguay last week - which left England with little chance of progressing beyond the group stage - which had a 13.1 million average. The peak for the Uruguay game of 20.3 million - said to be the highest on British TV since the London 2012 closing ceremony - was well up on yesterday’s peak of 9.5 million. Yesterday’s match in Belo Horizonte was still the most watched programme of the evening, and the peak as the match neared its conclusion represented almost half the TV audience at that time. ITV4’s coverage of the Uruguay v Italy match yesterday - which included the moment in which Luis Suarez appeared to bite defender Giorgio Chiellini - had an average of 700,000 viewers with a 2.9 million peak.

A fan with '66' written on the back - a reference to the World Cup-winning England team of that year, watches the plane touch down . Now THAT's dedication: Fans waiting on the roof of the car park at Manchester Airport for the England Football squad to disembark . A social club changed the name of its speciality England beer from Lion’s Roar to Lion’s Whimper and dropped the price so they could cheer up their punters. Steward at the Knowl Club Paul Moon, 37, created a new label for the guest beer after a paltry 12 people turned out for the England v Costa Rica game on Tuesday night. The father-of-one, from Mirfield, West Yorkshire, said: 'I made a label and stuck it over the name. I think whimper was a more appropriate name for this campaign.' He also reduced the price of the beer, described by brewery Banks’s as a 'rip-roaring brew', from £2.50 to £1.50 and decided to donate all proceeds of sales to the local kids’ football teams at Battyeford Sporting Club. Paul, who has been steward at the club for 18 months, said: 'The place was rammed for the last couple of games with well over 100 people coming in to watch the game. It’s almost as if people forgot that they were playing. We’d brought in guest beers for the qualifying stages and took on extra staff in preparation, but of course it wasn’t needed on Tuesday night. 'I think at least we ended on a high because the beer went down a storm with the lads that turned up and we had a laugh and a joke about it. 'I’m hoping that by donating the money to youth football we might be investing in England’s future prospects.' Drinker Maurice Hirst, an 80-year-old retired boat builder, said: 'I’ve seen a few England games over the years and calling it Whimper seems to sum up this tournament. 'I’m pleased my drinking could help future England stars.' Market trader David Butterworth, 64, said: 'Whimper is a great beer. I just wish the official sponsors, Budweiser, would follow suit and reduce the cost of their beer too.' Banks’s guest beer Lion’s Roar was created for England’s efforts in the World Cup tournament. Their website says: 'Banks’s has produced a rip-roaring beer for every English football fan to enjoy. 'This easy drinking, ‘belter’ of a beer with malty, hoppy flavours and a refreshing clean, bitter ""finish"" is a winner every time.

"Israel has launched a series of military strikes against Gaza in retaliation to rocket attacks by Palestinian militants. The country's defence minister Moshe Yaalon said Israel will not sit back and take cross border raids on its territory after its military took out a number of targets. The strikes were the first military action by Israel since an eight-day exchange of attacks in November. It comes after militants - thought to belong to Hamas - fired rockets and mortars into southern Israel. Attacks: Hamas militants protest the death of Palestinian prisoner Maysara Abu Hamdiyeh in Hebron, in the northern Gaza Strip. He had been serving a life sentence in an Israeli jail . Fighting: Some protesters carried guns and even rocket propelled grenades during the march. Hamas militants have been accused of firing rockets into southern Israel in recent weeks as tensions have risen . Mr Yaalon's remarks came as two rockets fired from the coastal territory exploded at an Israeli border town, according to police. Code Red sirens wailed in Sderot at about 7:30 a.m. local time warning of incoming rockets and forcing the town residents who were on their way to work or school to take cover. No injuries were sustained in the attack. Hours earlier, Israel struck targets in Gaza in response to Palestinian rocket attacks. It was the first time Israel retaliated for Gaza rocket fire since an informal cease-fire ended eight days of cross-border strikes between Israel and the Hamas-ruled territory in November. That round of fighting was triggered in part by almost daily Palestinian rocket and mortar attacks on southern Israel. Defiant: Israeli defence minister Moshe Yaalon said his country will not tolerate cross border attacks on its territory . Palestinians in Gaza have fired . several rockets since an informal cease-fire took hold after the . fighting. Two rockets were fired during President Barack Obama's visit . to Israel two weeks ago. The . Israeli military says that, of the five rockets fired in the past day, . three hit Israel while another two exploded prematurely inside Gaza. 'We will not allow shooting of any sort towards our citizens and our . forces,' Mr Yaalon said in a statement. He said he holds the Islamic . militant group Hamas responsible for all rocket attacks from Gaza, which . it has ruled since 2007. Israel's . chief military spokesman, Brig Gen. Yoav Mordechai, echoed his . sentiments to Israel Radio. He said Israel 'will not tolerate' returning . to the days before the fighting in November where Palestinian rocket . attacks were common. 'Our goal is to keep southern Israel quiet,' he said. During eight days of violence in . November, the Israeli military said 1,500 rockets were fired at Israel, . including the first from Gaza to strike the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem . areas. The rocket attacks killed six Israelis and wounded dozens. Israeli airstrikes killed 169 Palestinians, many of them militants, and . caused considerable damage. The spokesman meanwhile said the military is on alert for 'riots' in Palestinian areas over an autopsy planned for later in the day for a Palestinian prisoner who died of cancer in an Israeli jail the day before. Palestinian officials said Israel was responsible for the death of Maysara Abu Hamdiyeh, charging medical negligence. Battle: Israeli prison guards fired tear gas to quell disturbances by Palestinian inmates on Tuesday after Mr Hamdeya's death. Many Palestinians view their jailed compatriots as heroes in a fight for statehood . The 64-year-old was serving a life sentence for his role in a foiled attempt to bomb a busy cafe in Jerusalem in 2002. Spokesman Mordechai however said the Palestinian Authority was exploiting his death to 'resume popular protests.' Prisons Authority spokeswoman Sivan . Weizman said Abu Hamdiyeh was treated well by Israeli specialists and . died in a hospital in Beersheba. Fears: The protest was one of several by Palestinians in Gaza in recent weeks . She said the prison service asked the . parole board for the prisoner's early release after his cancer was . diagnosed as terminal last week, but the appeal was still being . processed at the time of his death. Ms Weizman said almost all of the 4,600 Palestinian prisoners detained by Israel refused their breakfasts Wednesday morning in a symbolic act of protest. As news of Abu Hamdiyeh's death spread Tuesday, Palestinian prisoners in several jails began banging on their cell doors and hurling objects. Later, protests spread to Jerusalem and parts of the West Bank where protestors hurled fire bombs and rocks at soldiers. Tensions are high in Israeli jails, where thousands of Palestinian security prisoners are being held. Some have held hunger strikes and Palestinians have held large protests demanding their release. After decades of conflict with Israel, the issue of prisoners is emotionally charged in Palestinian society. Inmates are widely esteemed by Palestinians regardless of the reasons for their incarceration, which range from mass murder to throwing rocks.

"A flight to California turned to horror yesterday when a passenger tried to open the door at 30,000 feet in the air, forcing the pilot into an emergency landing. Travellers on board the Southwest Airlines flight 722, from Chicago to Sacramento, began screaming in terror when the man approached the back of the plane and attempted to unlock the hatch-door. He had minutes earlier emerged form the bathroom after soaking himself in water.

"San Francisco 49ers player Aldon Smith was arrested on Sunday at Los Angeles Airport after allegedly telling security officers he had a bomb while being uncooperative during a bag search. In footage posted online the 6ft 4in linebacker can be seen speaking with officers before being lead away, telling them he'd done nothing wrong and saying they would be 'embarrassed'. Smith was arrested around 2pm and booked on one count of 'false report of a bomb', a charge which carries a penalty of up to one year behind bars. He has been released after posting $20,000 bail. Scroll down for video . San Fransisco 49ers linebacker Aldon Smith has been arrested at Los Angeles airport after apparently telling security officers that he had a bomb in his luggage . According to police he became 'agitated' and 'belligerent' after being selected for a random search. A witness said he told officers he had done nothing wrong as he was lead away . Arrested: 49ers player Aldon Smith, pictured, was arrested on Sunday at LAX after reportedly indicating to a TSA agent he had a bomb . According to a police statement Smith became 'belligerent' while waiting on a Terminal 1 security line and was randomly picked for a . second screening. Sgt. Karla Ortiz said: 'At . approximately 1400 hrs, a 25-year-old male resident of San Jose, . California, was going through Terminal 1 screening and was randomly . selected for a secondary screening. 'The suspect then became belligerent and uncooperative with the process and with the TSA agent, making a comment indicating that he was in possession of a bomb before proceeding towards the gate area. 'Los Angeles Airport Police made contact with him at the gate and he was positively identified as the person in question. 'Once again the male subject became uncooperative and he was detained and taken into custody by Airport Police and is currently being transported to LAPD for booking.' Eyewitness John Egan told the San Jose Mercury News that Smith was just agitated. 'I heard him say, ""I did nothing wrong,""' Egan said. 'The whole thing ratcheted up from there. The cops were trying to calm him down. He wasn't out of control; just agitated.' Legal troubles: Smith is seen in this September 2013 booking photo, when he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence and marijuana possession . 49ers general manager Trent Baalke also released a statement, expressing his disappointment. 'We are disappointed to learn of the incident today involving Aldon Smith,' Baalke said. 'As this is a pending legal matter and we are still gathering the pertinent facts, we will have no further comment.' Sports fans have taken to Twitter to criticise Smith, calling him 'stupid', 'dumb' and calling for him to leave the team. One user,  Mike S, said: 'I'm a diehard Niners fan, and he's a great player. But Aldon Smith has got to go,' while cesinha added: 'Aldon Smith is plain stupid.' While most of the comments were crtical of Smith, or poked fun at 49ers fans, there was some support for the controversial player.

"The supercars parading through London's streets reached a whole new level of extravagance this week when a wealthy Arab rolled his gold Range Rover into town. The 'Mystere' is a £150,000 version of the famous British vehicle which has been given an overhaul by German tuning house Hamann. The car's normal design has been replaced with a customised body-kit which includes oversized bumpers and a bonnet vent. Scroll down for video . The £150,000 'Hamann Mystere' is one of the most flamboyant vehicles yet to be seen in the capital . It is thought the Range Rover's Saudi owner brought the car over with him for his summer stay in London . Its Saudi owner has also opted for the luxury off-roader, which is fitted with 23-inch alloy wheels, to be kitted out with a black and gold wrap. The car, with the registration plate '666', has been flown over to the UK by its Saudi owner and is parked outside the expensive Wellesley Hotel in Knightsbridge. A top-spec Range Rover costs £100,000 - with Hamann charging around £50,000 for the 'Mystere' conversion. It is one of a number of flamboyant cars which have arrived in London for the summer season, when Middle-Eastern millionaires escape the desert temperatures for a holiday in the UK. One local resident said: 'Range Rovers don't normally stand out because there are so many of them in London, but this one is different.' 'You can't miss it. It is . amazing that the owner, who must be quite rich, decided to have it . wrapped gold coloured. It is so eye-catching, but I don't think it will . be winning any style awards. The luxury off-roader was spotted in the car park of the Wellesley Hotel in Knightbridge, opposite Hyde Park . It comes after this ornately-painted Lamborghini Aventador was spotted in the area last summer . The 4x4's gold finish is similar to this Bugati Veyron which was parked outside the Dorchester last year . He added: 'It was parked next to a Rolls-Royce Ghost, and you hardly noticed the Roller. It is not often that a Rolls-Royce looks like the understated car.' Last year, residents of West London complained the capital was being inundated with supercars, which they claimed were leading to unruly driving. Petrol-heads were seen driving round wealthy areas of the city in Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Bugattis and attracting bands of camera-carrying youngsters, known as the Carparrazzi. Channel 4 made a documentary about the drivers, called Millionaire Boy Racers, after local residents called for a clampdown. In 2010, a £1.2 million Koenigsegg CCXR . and £350,000 Lamborghini Murcielago were clamped outside famous . department store Harrods. The supercars, like this Lamborghini, are regularly seized by police for over suspicions about their insurance . This bright pink Rolls Royce was among the expensive cars spotted in London last summer . Local residents say their lives have been made a misery by the supercars like these driving around the district . Crowds of tourists watched in disbelief as a traffic warden first ticketed then clamped both vehicles, which were believed to have belonged to the oil-rich Qatari royal family. It was the first summer in which the so-called 'invasion of Arab supercars' was noticed on London's streets, with a £1 million-plus Bugatti Veyron and a £500,000 Mercedes Benz McLaren SLR, both chrome-finished and with Middle Eastern plates, spotted outside the Berkeley Hotel in Knightsbridge. It is believed wealthy Arabs from Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia relocate to the capital in the Middle East's hottest summer months and compete over who can show off the most expensive vehicle. Experts said insuring some the supercars on London's roads can cost more than £50,000-a-year, with a £15,000 excess. Last summer, a £350,000 purple and orange Lamborghini was seized by the police after the driver was pulled over, again outside Harrods, because of police concerns about his insurance. Weeks later the same car was seen back on the streets, but was given a parking ticket just days after police handed it back to the owner. A policeman talks to the owner of a blue Maserati on a double red line route during the Channel 4 show . This gold and white Bugatti put two Porsches in the shade when it parked outside Harrods last summer .

"The UN is about to go to war for the first time in its history after the Security Council voted unanimously to intervene to fight rebels in the Congo. Around 3,000 UN troops wearing the blue insignia, are being deployed to the central African nation which has been wracked by years of civil war and lawlessness. The UN has led a 14-year-long peacekeeping in a bid to end the ethic conflict which was sparked by the genocide in neighbouring Rwanda when thousands of Hutus fled into the Congo to evade justice. Commander: Brazilian General Carlos Alberto Dos Santos Cruz (centre) arrives in the eastern Congolese city of Goma on Tuesday this week. He will lead a UN  force against rebel fighters . Much of the fighting is now over the country's natural resources which include large quantities of gold, copper, diamonds, and coltan (a mineral used in cell phones). According to the organisation World Without Genocide, the violence has killed as many as 5.4 million people making it the world's bloodiest conflict since World War II. The use of child soldiers in the conflict is also said to be common and in many areas armed gangs are free to roam at will terrorising local populations. But until now the conflict has been largely ignored by the outside world. It will be the first time that the UN itself will be in direct control of a fighting force, responsible for the tactics on the ground, troop deployments and air strikes. UN peacekeepers in pictured in  Bunia, Congo, in 2003. It will be the first time a UN force has gone to war in the history of the organisation . The force will be made up of soldiers from South Africa, Tanzania and Malawi and is under the command of Brazilian general Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz, who  is credited with dismantling criminal gangs in Haiti in 2007. It will be deployed against M23 (March 23) rebels in the east of the country. Speaking to the BBC last month General Santos Cruz said: 'The most critical area is nowadays the eastern part of the country. The United Nation has expressed grave concern over the recruitment of child soldiers by rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). In a statement, the UN strongly condemned 'the recruitment and use of children and all forms of human rights violations that are committed by the March 23 movement (M23) and other armed groups against children.' The statement also called on the M23 rebels fighting in the African country to stop the violence and abuse against children, adding that 'They will be held personally responsible for violations committed against children who are recruited in their ranks.' Last year, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) revealed that a Congolese rebel general, wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) on war crime charges, had forcefully recruited some 150 children. According to the report, rebel leader General Jean Bosco Ntaganda, known by the nom-de-guerre 'Terminator' due to his brutal methods, kidnapped children and teens from their homes, schools, fields and the roadsides in the volatile east of the DRC. Once joined the rebels, several of the boys were forced to walk ahead of the column of rebel soldiers to be the first to be shot in attacks, the report said. 'I am ready to face the most difficult of scenarios. The main objective is to relieve the suffering of the people.' The Security Council has gone to considerable lengths to ensure unanimous approval for the action. Even Russia and China, normally reluctant to back such endeavours, voted in favour. But it is not without risk with some fearing that allowing a UN force to intervene on one side in a civil war could do irreparable damage to the reputation of a supposedly impartial organisation. The M23 rebellion began in 2012 but has already led to around 800,000 people being forced to flee their homes. Until recently neighbouring countries Rwanda and Uganda have been supporting the M23 rebels but have recently abandoned them following reports of atrocities and international condemnation of the movement. Much of the Congo is rich in mineral wealth and has vast agricultural potential. But the years of conflict has meant it has fallen behind the rest of Africa in terms of economic development. Early signs have been encouraging, with representatives of the M23 movement this week announcing that they want to resume peace talks with the government. Rene Abandi, who heads the M23 delegation, said on Tuesday that they are 'committed' to the Uganda-mediated talks despite plans to deploy U.N. peacekeepers mandated to attack the rebels. The rebels had earlier insisted the talks were hopeless amid such plans. The change of tune illustrates the success of international military pressure on rebels who recently spoke of war if offensive peacekeepers were deployed in eastern Congo. Rene Abandi, who heads the M23 delegation said the group was committed to peace talks. He said: 'We are still committed to the dialogue, the ceasefire, and to solving the root cause of the conflict'. The UN forces is to be deployed against M23 rebels in the east of the country . M23 rebel fighters rest as they withdraw near the town of Sake, some 42 km (26 miles) west of Goma. The rebellion, began in 2012 but has already led to around 800,000 people being forced to flee their homes . Representatives of the M23 movement this week announcing that they want to resume peace talks with the government . Congo's government and M23 have been negotiating in Uganda since December under the banner of a regional bloc called the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, or ICGLR, of which Congo is a member and Uganda's president is the chair. The talks have often been set back by accusations and counter-accusations about who is responsible for rampant violence in Congo's North Kivu province. Last year regional leaders under the ICGLR framework asked the Congolese government to listen to the 'legitimate grievances' of rebels who now control huge chunks of territory in eastern Congo. The leaders also urged M23 to stop seizing more territory. The Security Council has gone to considerable lengths to ensure unanimous approval for the action. Even Russia and China, normally reluctant to back such endeavours, voted in favour . Jason Stearns, a Congo expert who runs the Usalama Project, a think tank that researches Congo's armed groups, said: 'The M23 is worried about the arrival of the intervention brigade - not so much by their military prowess, which remains relatively unknown, but by the political clout that Tanzania and South Africa, who are providing most of the soldiers, have. 'Still, they hope that (U.N. envoy) Mary Robinson's insistence on negotiations will make the government more flexible.'","3,000 UN troops are being deployed to the central African nation .

"Investigators hunting kidnapped British tourist Judith Tebbutt were last night checking claims Islamist fanatics are threatening to use her as a ‘human shield’. An Al Qaeda-linked group in Somalia claimed she was being held to deter further attacks after a U.S. drone bombed their base 11 days ago, killing dozens of suspected terrorists. The Islamists, styling themselves as terror group Ras Kamboni, also threatened to parade their terrified hostage as a trophy at a press conference, it was reported. Desperate hunt: The officers pace the beach as an armed guard sits in the background . War-torn: A gunman in the streets of Kismayo, the southern Somali city where Islamist insurgents are believed to be holding Judith Tebbutt . Mrs Tebbutt, 56, has been missing since Saturday night when a gang raided the beach hut in exclusive Kenyan resort Kiwayu Safari Village, where she was staying with her publisher husband David, 58. He was shot dead before they whisked her by speedboat towards Somalia, just 18 miles away. David Cameron said yesterday the Government was ‘doing everything we possibly can on this desperately tragic case’. Scotland Yard and British intelligence officers were assessing the claims of Ras Kamboni, a faction of the Al Shabaab group controlling southern Somalia. Help with the search: British officials, believed to be from Scotland Yard, on the beach at the Kiwayu Resort, in Kenya . Executed: British holidaymaker David Tebbutt, left, was killed by a . single gunshot to the chest. His son, Oliver, right, is said to be . devastated and concerned that his mother's hearing difficulty will . compound her suffering . The gang offered no proof as to whether they were truly holding the mother-of-one. But Shielk Abdul Rahman Dehere, one of its leaders, claimed she was  seized in answer to an attack from an U.S. drone on one of its weapons stores in Kismayo, 328 miles south-west of Somali capital Mogadishu. Luxury: Rooms at the Kiwayu resort cost up to £900 a night in high season . He said: ‘We do not wish to harm her, we would not kill an innocent woman… but any further attack of force, we will kill the lady.’ Dehere spoke in a telephone call to a . Somali Nairobi-based journalist who built links with Al Shabaab during . the kidnapping of Britons Paul and Rachel Chandler. He added: ‘The lady . is not feeling well. She is not talking. She is finding it hard to speak. Her health is good but she is traumatised.’ Separately, . an Al Shabaab radio broadcast claimed that it was the group holding Mrs . Tebbutt, and that her husband had been killed because he refused to . obey their orders. No . ransom demand has been received, and no trace found in Kenya of Mrs . Tebbutt. The social worker, who wears a hearing aid, was reportedly . taken to Marka, an Al Shabaab heartland 45 miles south west of . Mogadishu. She is said to have been moved at . least twice since then. The Somalia Report news agency claimed she would . be paraded at a ‘press conference’, an ordeal suffered several times by . the Chandlers. Yesterday Al Shabaab denied having . anything to do with the murder and kidnapping, but made no mention of . its shadowy faction Ras Kamboni. Experts say no pirate could operate in . southern Somalia without Al Shabaab’ s authority. Remote: The beachside cabin at the Kiwayu Safari Village where the Tebbutts were staying . Islamist militants are believed to be holding Judith Tebbutt in Kismayo, along the coast from the resort of Kiwayu where she was seized . Ali Shebwana, leader of the village where the couple, from Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire had been staying, said: ‘They will not harm her as she has value only if she is alive.’ Last night Kenyan police arrested a second man over the kidnapping. He is suspected of being an associate of the first suspect, handyman Ali Babitu, who used to work at the resort. Both men are being questioned in custody and have apparently admitted helping the raiders under duress, after themselves being held at gunpoint.

"President Barack Obama is 'the most racist president' in U.S. history, according to Ferris Bueller's Day Off actor Ben Stein. The actor and economist, famous for his scene in the 1986 movie in which he monotonously repeats the name 'Bueller' during a painfully dull economics class, said President Obama was 'racist' because of White House attempts to 'racialize' voting. His attack on President Obama was launched during a discussion on the importance of the issue of the U.S. economy for midterm voters. Stein's claims were made during a discussion on Fox News about the importance of the economy in the midterm elections . Ben Stein pictured in the 1986 movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off, in which he plays a dull economics teacher . He told Fox News: 'This president is the most racist president there has ever been in America, he is purposely trying to use race to divide Americans. 'What the White House is doing is trying to racialize class politics. 'And they're especially trying to tell the African American voter that the GOP is against letting them have a chance at a good life in this economy, and that is just a complete lie.' Meanwhile, results show the Democrats received a shellacking in the midterms, with Republicans consolidating their power on Capitol Hill by picking up more seats than needed to gain control of the U.S. Senate. Their victories included key wins in Arkansas, West Virginia, Montana, South Dakota, Colorado, North Carolina and Iowa - all seats controlled by Democrats when the day began. The Republican National Committee (RNC) took a massive victory lap after the North Carolina race's outcome was no longer in doubt. 'The American people have put their trust in the Republican Party, sending a GOP majority to the U.S. Senate,' said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. Actor Ben Stein (pictured left) launched a scathing attack on President Obama, claiming the White House was 'using race to divide Americans' 'Our party's principles and message resonated with voters across the country. This was a rejection of President Obama's failed polices and Harry Reid's dysfunctional Senate.' 'Republicans have been given the opportunity to lead the country in a better direction, and the Republican House and Senate are ready to listen to the American people. We hope President Obama will too.' 'It's time to get to work on creating jobs, expanding American energy development, pursuing real healthcare reform, reducing spending, reining in the federal government, and keeping America safe.'","Democrats and White House attempted to 'racialize' the mid term elections .

"The Winter Olympics have hit their toughest obstacle yet - a big burning ball of gas. Sunny weather in the Russian resort of Sochi has melted ski and snowboard runs, leaving huge patches of grass exposed and making the athletes' intricately-prepared runs treacherous. For those with time on their hands, however, the heat is good news - with Britain's first ever medallist on the snow Jenny Jones catching some well-deserved rays. Scroll down for video . Paradise: Today was a beautiful day in Sochi - but not for athletes, who struggled to cope with the warm weather as it melted ski and snowboard runs.

Ski jumpers . face injury in softened landing areas while many of the sliding events . like curling have been held at night to stop the ice being melted as . fast. Meanwhile those who rely on extravagant tricks for their sport, like snowboarders, are floundering as they struggle on their courses. One Alpine skiing race track had training suspended in a bid to preserve as much snow as possible for today's event. Olympics authorities in Russia have reservoirs of snow packed away near the mountain venues yet dismissed calls for it to be used, claiming it was not needed. Dmitry . Chernyshenko, head of the local organising committee, told journalists: 'It's not a big surprise for us. We're a subtropical city'. The top temperature in Sochi today was 15 degrees celsius, warmer than all 10 of the last Winter Olympics host cities and six of the last 10 Summer Olympics cities. It has led the Games at the Russian resort - famously warmer and more humid than most of the country - to be nicknamed the Warmer or subtropical Olympics, with some people questioning why the Games were held there in the first place. The hastag #ColderThanSochi has begun . trending on Twitter as armchair athletes from around the world compare . conditions on their TV sets to what they can see out the window. The . coldest of the last 20 host cities today was Montreal at a top . temperature of minus 10 - with only Barcelona, Los Angeles, Athens and . Sydney warmer than Sochi.

London, . which enjoyed a heat wave as it hosted the Summer Olympics in 2012, was . five degrees colder than Sochi today while 1980 Summer Olympics city . Moscow was a full 12 degrees colder. Austrian ski jumper Wilhelm Denifl said: 'Holes and ruts . form if the snow on the landing zone is not hard enough... The snow becomes unstable, . and if we are landing consistently in the same area, and at a high . speed, the pressure associated with landing can make it unstable. And . dangerous.' U.S. Alpine ski racer Bode . Miller went from being a pre-race favourite during training runs down an icy hill . to an eighth-place finisher when the downhill course got slushier on Sunday. He said: 'It would be a . tough call to be like, ""The weather is changing, we're just going to go . completely throw a dart in the dark and hope it hits."" We had to stick . with what we knew. 'In hindsight, it was a mistake, . because on training day, it was boilerplate ice and you needed a lot of . edge.

Poor timing: London, which enjoyed a heat wave as it hosted the Summer Olympics in 2012, was five degrees colder than Sochi today while 1980 Summer Olympics city Moscow was a full 12 degrees colder . Hardy: Perhaps Russians are more accustomed to cold weather, but athletes have also complained . Outdoor . sports have always been at the mercy of the weather. Training for a pre-Olympic World Cup weekend in St. Moritz, Switzerland, had to be cancelled while fog forced . the cancellation of the last men's downhill race before Sochi. That race had already . moved from Germany because of a lack of snow. Women's races, meanwhile, shifted from . one resort in Slovenia to another because there wasn't enough snow - . only to have rain and fog wipe out a giant slalom at the new spot. And it may have been warmer than every other Winter Olympics host city today in Sochi, but they have not been without there problems either. Four years ago races were delayed by warm weather in Whistler, British Columbia, while at Turin, Italy, in 2006 the women's super-G was postponed 24 hours. Skiing in Nagano, Japan, had to wait for two days in . 1998 and at Sarajevo in 1984, . both downhill races were postponed. Heat: The sun's appearance has made conditions treacherous in events like the snowboard halfpipe, pictured . The show must go on: Athletes are in the last throes of training for their winter events despite the weather . Idyll: The beach next to Sochi's Olympic stadium today. The Winter Games in Whistler, Turin, Nagano and Sarajevo were all affected by warmer-than-expected weather. The February average for Sochi is 10 degrees . ALPINE SKIING: Cold keeps the snow . along the course icier and therefore more compact and slick. Softer snow means it's easier to make turns, but also slows down the skiers, tempting them to take more risks and be more aggressive otherwise they can't build up enough speed. HALFPIPE: . Riders call the slush 'mashed potatoes' and it slows them . down, making it harder to get enough air to pull off flips and . twists. Conditions must be as perfect as possible and start slipping when the temperature gets anywhere above freezing. SLOPESTYLE: . The firmer the snow surface, the better it is for slopestyle skiers and . snowboarders, because it gives the athletes a firmer takeoff and more time in the air. SNOWBOARDCROSS: . Soft snow can slow down the cars and turn races into more strategy as speed, which could make things more interesting for the viewers if not the athletes. SKI . JUMPING: Athletes risk injury when the artificial snow in the landing area is heated by the sun. Their landings . become bumpy, which can throw competitors off-balance and make them . fall. Also, their skis could dig too far into the snow. The ramp itself . is kept cool by a refrigeration . unit. CROSS COUNTRY . AND BIATHLON: Courses become treacherous in the downhill . curves, where it's easy to lose one's balance at high speed on thin . skis. Skiers adjust the amount of wax on their skis and can change the setup several times a day. SLIDING . SPORTS: Many of the sliding competitions are being held at night for lower temperatures. Miles of pipe installed in tracks pump temperature-controlled ammonia . through the concrete, keeping the surface cold enough during the day. Shades installed on the track's roof also . shield the ice from the sun, and workers spray dry ice and water.Source: AP .","Resort is hotter today than last 10 Winter Games cities - and 6 summer ones .

"The locals swear it is the good sea air that keeps them healthy. But whatever the reason, the picturesque town of Christchurch in Dorset is today named as the pensioner capital of Britain. Nearly one in three of those living in the coastal town is retired, double the national average. The town of 47,750 has nearly 14,200 pensioners – 29.7 per cent – a report published today shows. Suits you: Picturesque Christchurch is home to 14,200 pensioners . Scenic: Christchurch has the highest percentage of pensioners of any town in Britain . And, according to separate data from the Office of National Statistics, this figure will rise to nearly 37.9 per cent by 2031. Residents say the town, with its mild climate, 11th century castle and large natural harbour,  is driven by an army of active  over-65s who keep a vibrant cultural community running. The report, compiled by the Prudential and based on analysis of 2011 census figures, show Tower Hamlets in London has the lowest proportiTon of retirees in the UK, with just one in 16 (6 per cent). The South West, with its beaches and countryside, was found to be the most popular region for retirees generally, with a fifth of the population of pension age. Other areas listed as grey hotspots include West Somerset, in second place, North Norfolk in third, and Rother in East Sussex in fourth. The Prudential report showed London is the least popular region for retirees. Only around one in nine (11 per cent) of those living in the capital are pensioners. Vince Smith-Hughes, retirement expert at Prudential, said: ‘Perhaps unsurprisingly, there’s a tendency for people to move out to the country when they stop working, where property prices can be lower and the quality of life is often thought to be higher. ‘However, people planning to stop working shouldn’t assume that a move to the country is the simple answer to a comfortable retirement, as the cost of living in these hot spots can be surprisingly high.’ Almost half of homes currently listed for sale in Christchurch have a price tag of at least £300,000. Last year, a beach hut in the area sold for £170,000 two days after going on the market. Overall, over 65s now make up nearly a sixth of the British population. There are 900,000 more over 65s than there were a decade ago, highlighting just how big the challenge Britain faces in caring for our elderly. An estimated 16.4 per cent of the population, or 9,223,000 people, are over 65 as the post-war baby boomers reach their twilight years and life expectancy continues to rise. Despite concerns over the rising cost of care, research suggests pensioners are richer than at any time in the past 15 years. The Institute for Fiscal Studies found last year that pensioner incomes have risen by 29.4 per cent since 1999 compared with just 26 per cent for working people.","The town of 47,750 has nearly 14,200 pensioners .

"As they splash around in their tanks, they look like any other healthy Atlantic salmon. Their eyes are bright, their skin is gloriously silvery and their fully grown bodies exude power. It’s only when you look closely at their hatching dates that the alarm bells start to ring. A normal Atlantic salmon takes 30 months to grow to maturity . . . this variety took just 16. The majestic specimens are ‘frankenfish’ — genetically modified salmon created in a secretive research base in the Panama rainforest. 'Frankenfish' are genetically modified salmon created by company AquaBounty which grow at twice the rate of wild Atlantic Salmon, and are constantly hungry (file picture) The salmon have been given genes from two other species of fish to make them grow twice as fast as normal. And while most people would baulk at the prospect, GM fish could soon be coming to a dinner table near you. Last week, Canadian authorities gave approval for the commercial production of GM salmon eggs for the first time, while U.S. food regulators are in the final stages of approving the fish for sale in supermarkets and restaurants. And where GM salmon lead, other animals will follow. Plans are in place to genetically modify up to 50 other species, including trout and the tropical white fish tilapia, for human consumption. GM chickens, cattle, sheep and pigs won’t be far behind. The prospect of the first commercially produced GM livestock has, not surprisingly, raised concerns. Even those who support GM crop production believe the risks involved in GM animals are simply too great. So what is so dangerous about these innocuous-looking fish? And could they be served in the UK soon? GM salmon are the creation of AquaBounty, a biotechnology company based in Massachusetts and listed on the London Stock Market. The firm has owned the rights to produce GM salmon since 1996. It also produces feeds to speed up the growth and boost the immunity of farmed shrimp. The fish have been given two genes from other species — a growth hormone gene from the Chinook salmon, the largest of the Pacific salmon species, and a gene from the eel-like ocean pout which ‘switches on’ the growth hormone. The combination of these two genes allows the GM salmon to keep producing a growth factor hormone — the substance that triggers their metabolism to eat more and put on weight — all the year round. The farmed fish have been given the growth hormone from the Chinook salmon and a gene from the ocean pout which switches the growth gene on . Normal young salmon, in contrast, go through growth spurts only in the spring and summer. The rest of the year — when food is less scarce — their growth slows dramatically. With growth hormone coursing through their bodies, the GM salmon can reach market size of around 13lb in 16 to 18 months, making them cheaper to produce. AquaBounty is spreading the production and marketing of the GM fish over three countries. Around 100,000 salmon eggs will be created every year in its factory at Prince Edward Island, Canada, before being shipped to Panama. There they will be grown into adults in landlocked ‘sealed tanks’ for 18 months, killed and sold in the U.S. Pro-GM scientists insist there is no reason why GM food should be any more dangerous to humans than ordinary food. After all, mankind has been tampering with the genetic make-up of animals and plants since the dawn of farming through selective natural breeding. Genetic modification, they say, is simply a more precise addition or subtraction of genes. But there are two major differences with GM. Changes in animals and plants that once took centuries can now take place within just one generation. And genes from one species can be added to another. Tomatoes can be given anti-freeze genes from Arctic fish to make them withstand frosts. Rice can be given genes from daffodils to make it a rich source of Vitamin A. Critics say the combination of genes from different species could have unforeseen consequences. While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found no worrying differences between the meat of GM and ordinary fish, no one has yet been able to show whether the fish are safe over many years of consumption. While the salmon are meant to be farmed if they do escape they could breed and wipe out wild fish . And according to U.S. charity Ocean Conservancy, there are significant differences between GM and conventional farmed salmon. GM salmon appears to have less omega 3 — the fatty acid that can protect against heart disease. It also appears to have higher levels of a growth hormone called IGF-1. Studies of a small number of salmon suggest that six nutrients are present at values that differ by more than 10 per cent. The GM variety had less folic acid, less zinc, less magnesium and less phosphorus — but more niacin and vitamin B6. The findings suggest ‘potential food quality differences’, according to the charity Ocean Conservancy. There are also concerns that GM salmon could have more allergy-triggering chemicals. The FDA concluded that was not the case — but its findings were based on a study of only six fish. This is not enough evidence to conclude that GM salmon is harmful. But it raises questions which have not been fully answered. There are more concerns about the threat to the environment they pose. Wild Atlantic salmon are already threatened by over-fishing and the accidental release of farmed salmon. Introducing a population of bigger, tougher and faster-growing salmon could finish them off. Dr Robert Devlin, who has grown his own variant of GM salmon at the Centre of Aquaculture and Environmental Research in Vancouver, says they are more aggressive than conventional fish. ‘They’re hungry all the time,’ he told CBC News. A study at McGill University in Quebec this summer found that GM salmon can breed with wild brown trout, creating a hybrid that grows even faster than the GM salmon. In a simulation, the hybrid ate far more food than wild fish sharing the same waters, and led to wild fish being far smaller than they should have been. US food regulators are about to approve the fish for sale, while Canada has given the go-ahead for the production of GM eggs for the first time (file picture) AquaBounty insists that won’t happen because it processes the eggs in its factory to make the fish sterile and so unable to breed. However, data from the company suggests the process is not 100 per cent effective. And, according to regulators, it needs to make only 95 per cent of eggs sterile. AquaBounty also says the risks of escape are minuscule because the fish will be stored in secure tanks miles from the sea. But the experience in Scotland —where at least two million farmed salmon have escaped into the wild in the past decade — shows that keeping salmon secure is difficult. Just last month, thousands escaped from a ‘secure’ Norwegian farm and could now mate with wild salmon. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs says no company has yet applied to the European Commission to farm commercially or import GM fish into Europe. Approval from the commission would need a rigorous environmental risk assessment from the European Food Safety Authority. But European firms are watching closely. And the technology has supporters at the heart of Government. The previous chief scientist Sir John Beddington warned three years ago that the world faced a ‘perfect storm’ of a growing human population, food shortages and climate change. He argued it was hard to justify not using GM to feed the world. It is possible that canned imported GM salmon could arrive in the UK within the next few years (file picture) GM fish farms are unlikely in the UK for the foreseeable future. But, as pressure from scientists and biotech companies grows, it is possible imported canned GM salmon could arrive within the next few years. Fish experts are deeply concerned. Sir Michael Wigan, author of The Salmon, believes GM salmon almost certainly will get into the wild. ‘Salmon are incredible survivors’, he says. ‘They survived the industrial revolution in England where water wheels went up every five miles of river. They survived in the Tyne when it was an industrial sewer. ‘With the aid of its GM boost, who knows what this fish will be capable of doing.’ And once in the wild these super-charged, aggressive salmon — with their year-round appetite — could be devastating for the endangered natural wild salmon beloved by anglers and conservationists. Nature finds a way. And that way could be into the Atlantic, into British waters and ultimately onto our dinner plates.","GM salmon which grow twice as fast as wild fish have been developed .

"Microsoft is set to cut thousands of jobs in its biggest ever restructuring. The firm is believed to be planning the reorganisation as it integrates the mobile phone make Nokia it recently bought. The reductions, expected to be announced as soon as this week, could be in the Nokia unit and the parts of Microsoft that overlap with that business, as well as in marketing and engineering, Bloomberg reported. The restructuring may end up being the biggest in Microsoft history, topping the 5,800 jobs cut in 2009, the report said. Since absorbing the handset business of Nokia this spring, Microsoft has 127,000 employees, far more than rivals Apple and Google. Wall Street is expecting Chief Executive Satya Nadella to make major cuts, which would represent Microsoft's first major layoffs since 2009. The restructuring may end up being the biggest in Microsoft history, topping the 5,800 jobs cut in 2009, the report said. Some of the job cuts will be in marketing departments for businesses such as the global Xbox team, and among software testers, while other job cuts may result from changes Nadella is making to the engineering organization, Bloomberg reported. Despite the problems, Microsoft shares have climbed 13 percent so far this year. Last week, Nadella circulated a memo to employees promising to 'flatten the organization and develop leaner business processes' but deferred any comment on widely expected job cuts at the software company. Nadella said he would address detailed organizational and financial issues for the company's new financial year, which started at the beginning of this month, when Microsoft reports quarterly results on July 22. Microsoft could not be immediately reached for comment outside regular business hours. A two-year slump in personal computer sales ended in the second quarter, helped by improving demand in developed markets like North America and Europe. PC sales have fallen in recent years, hurt by surging demand for tablets and other mobile devices. Tough economic conditions around the world have also disrupted sales. But quarterly figures released Wednesday by the research firms Gartner Inc. and International Data Corp. show the global slump is easing. During the April to June quarter, Gartner said PC shipments edged up 0.1 percent to 75.8 million units. IDC, which also tracks PC shipments, had slightly different figures. Better sales in developed markets and interest in lower-priced PC models like the Chromebook, which uses Google's operating system and starts at $199, helped boost results. IDC vice president Loren Loverde said the better-than-expected results are partly due to a rebound from weaker demand last year, and potentially short-term replacement activity. 'We can look for some recovery in emerging regions going forward, but it may coincide with slower growth in mature regions, and we do not see the recent gains as a motive to raise the long-term outlook,' he said in a statement. Sales were strongest in Europe, the U.S. and Canada. Emerging markets continued to see declines, however, hurt by weak economies and competition from low-cost tablets. In the U.S., shipments rose 6.9 percent, spurred by businesses replacing office PCs and consumers updating Windows XP systems. Microsoft retired the Windows XP operating system earlier this year. 'One encouraging factor was a good intake of lower-end systems, including Chromebooks, which coincides with the recent slowing in tablet growth and perhaps signals the beginning of some stabilization on the consumer side,' said IDC Senior Research Analyst Jay Chou. IDC analyst Rajani Singh added that strong back-to-school and holiday seasons could help the U.S. PC market stay in positive territory for the rest of the year.","Chief Executive Satya Nadella set to announce cuts this week .

"A man from Superior, Wisconsin, who gained international notoriety after being convicted in 2006 of molesting the carcass of a dead deer was arrested this week for allegedly assaulting a female police officer. Bryan James Hathaway, 25, was arraigned Wednesday on four charges stemming from an incident that took place at the Hermantown Walmart on Monday night. Hathaway is accused of assaulting Officer Kody Vedder, obstructing legal process, fleeing on foot and receiving stolen property. He is being held in the St. Louis County Jail on $20,000 bail. Confrontation: Bryan James Hathaway, right, has been charged with assaulting off-duty police officer Kody Vedder, left, when she tried to detain him after spotting the 25-year-old acting suspiciously . According to the criminal complaint, . Vedder was off duty and shopping at Walmart with her 11-year-old . daughter after getting off work Monday evening, Duluth News Tribune reported. The . officer was wearing a black T-shirt with the word POLICE emblazoned . across the front and back of the shirt in bold white letters. With . her shopping done, Vedder was walking back to her car when she spotted . Hathaway in the backseat of a Lincoln Town Car parked next to her. The . complaint states that the officer thought that the man appeared . suspicious by the way he was repeatedly ducking down and watching out . for passersby. Vedder . got out of her car, knocked on the window of the vehicle where Hathaway . was sitting and pointed to the lettering on her shirt. She then told . the 25-year-old that she is a cop and instructed him not to move. Crime scene: The incident happened in the parking lot of the Hermantown Walmart in Wisconsin . The officer called 911 and asked for police response, but before the reinforcement had a chance to arrive, Hathaway tried to make a run for it, according to the complaint. Vedder grabbed the suspect by the back of his shirt and attempted to drag him down to the ground, but the complaint states that Hathaway wrenched himself out of her grasp and pushed her to the pavement. Vedder suffered scratches and bruises to her tail bone in the confrontation that required an X-ray. By that point, officers from three nearby police departments arrived on the scene and apprehended Hathaway near a Volkswagen dealership. When police searched the car where Vedder first spotted Hathaway, they recovered a backpack containing two Android cell phones in boxes, one of which still had the security device from Walmart around it. Bizarre case: In 2006, Hathaway, then 18, was convicted of having sex with the carcass of a deer he found in a ditch while biking . Officers also seized a Virgin Mobile LG cell phone and a new power cord in a plastic bag from the same store. This incident comes less than six years after Hathaway was arrested for having sex with a dead deer. On October 11, 2006, then-18-year-old Hathaway stumbled upon the animal’s carcass while biking along Stinson Avenue, Chicago Sun-Time reported. Repeat offender: In 2005, Hathaway pleaded no contest to shooting an Arabian horse for the purpose of having sex with the animal . Hathaway told detectives that he was aroused by the sight of the deer in the ditch. He admitted moving the carcass into the woods and assaulting it. ‘When I was done, I was upset with myself,’ Hathaway said in a statement to police at the time. ‘I know having sex with animals is wrong. But I can't help myself and I need help.’ He pleaded no contest to a charge of sexual gratification with an animal and was ordered to undergo psychological treatment after receiving a probationary sentence. In April of 2005, Hathaway pleaded no contest to a felony animal mistreatment charge in connection with the shooting of an Arabian horse in Douglas County. According to the criminal complaint in that case, Hathaway told investigators that he gunned down the animal, a 26-year-old gelding named Bambrick, for the purpose of having sex with it. However, Hathaway never got a chance to carry out his plan because he was scared off by a neighbor who heard the gunshot and walked in that direction. ‘I've never run across a personality like this,’ said Detective Sgt. Ed Anderson of the Douglas County, who investigated the crime. ‘I've never seen this type of behavior before.’ According to the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, Hathaway remains under probation supervision until August of next year. He also has a pending probation violation hearing in Chisago County for a 2008 theft conviction.","Bryan James Hathaway, 25, was charged with assaulting off-duty policewoman .

"A teenager is on the verge of becoming the youngest lawmaker in West Virginia’s history just a week before graduating high school after running on pro-life, pro-gun platform. Saira Blair, 17, was barely old enough to vote when she unseated a West Virginia lawmaker almost four times her age. After Tuesday's GOP primary, she is now one election away from becoming the youngest state lawmaker in West Virginia history - Larry Swan, sworn in as a 20-year-old delegate in 1972, set the current record. Saira Blair, 17, was barely old enough to vote when she unseated a West Virginia lawmaker almost four times her age . Blair's birthday is in July, so she would just meet the 18-year-old minimum age for West Virginia House of Delegates members. Seventeen-year-olds who will turn 18 by the November election can vote in West Virginia's primary. Soft-spoken and on-message, Blair is a churchgoer who says she is pro-life, pro-family, pro-gun rights and pro-business. Saira and mother. After Tuesday's GOP primary, she is now one election away from becoming the youngest state lawmaker in West Virginia history - Larry Swan, sworn in as a 20-year-old delegate in 1972, set the current record . She can rattle off a laundry list of businesses taxes she wants abolished or lowered. 'People saw that you don't need to wait until you are 40, 50 or 60 to realize our conservative principles are beneficial to everyone,' the Martinsburg teen said of her primary win. Blair also has family experience on her side. Her electrician father, Craig Blair, is a state senator who once held the House seat she is seeking. The teenager has more on her mind than stump speeches. She graduates from Hedgesville High School next Wednesday. Then she'll head to West Virginia University in the fall to pursue economics and Spanish degrees. She says finance is her field of choice. Soft-spoken and on-message, Blair is a churchgoer who says she is pro-life, pro-family, pro-gun rights and pro-business . Blair will skip spring classes if she clinches the Eastern Panhandle seat, since lawmakers convene for business in Charleston from January to March. The two-year House gig pays a $20,000 annual salary, plus per diem. Only about 150 votes separated Blair from Republican Del. Larry Kump in the Eastern Panhandle primary, according to unofficial results. But midterm turnout was dismal: Only about 1,600 votes were cast in the 59th House District. Friends in her high school class of 400 helped wave signs at polling places. She rallied some to register to vote. Blair also spent $4,900 and had a $2,300 loan, compared to Kump's $1,840 in spending. Saira's pledge - only about 150 votes separated Blair from Republican Del. Larry Kump in the Eastern Panhandle primary, according to unofficial results . 'Quite frankly, she out-campaigned me,' said Kump, 67, finishing his second House term. 'It was a low voter turnout election and she won.' Blair's conservative platform meshes with her Eastern Panhandle community, a GOP stronghold filled with Washington, D.C., commuters. Kump espoused his own brand of quirky conservatism. He sat in the Democratic House's back row with a yellow 'Don't tread on me' flag on his desk. He occasionally tapped into his inner Dr. Seuss and delivered rhymes in opposition to bills he considered government intrusion. He also wanted the Eastern Panhandle to return to Virginia, which Blair opposed. Blair has attended GOP meetings with her dad since the sixth grade and volunteers with various groups. She skipped senior prom to participate in a Youth in Government meeting in Charleston. 'She has never had a curfew or anything like that,' Craig Blair said. 'As long as you're performing to the best of your ability, I don't make rules for her.' Blair's Democratic opponent, 44-year-old lawyer Layne Diehl, said that it's positive that the teen won the primary, despite their differing views. 'She certainly has taken on this challenge and I think that she's up to it,' Diehl said.

"Tuesday night's victory for the Republicans wasn't just a blow to President Barack Obama - it was also a knock on Hillary Clinton, who campaigned for almost all of the candidates who lost Democratic US Senate seats on Tuesday. And Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, a likely challenger to Clinton in the 2016 presidential race, isn't letting her forget that she backed the wrong horses in 2014. The Republican lawmaker posted several pictures on Wednesday of Clinton with losing Senate candidates and the message #HillarysLosers. Paul is already trying to score points for the next election cycle by painting Tuesday night's losses as a reflection on Clinton's brand - even though she wasn't on the ballot in any state. Stepping up the pressure: Republican Senator Rand Paul is trying to paint Tuesday night's drubbing of the Democrats as a loss for Hillary Clinton, who campaigned for all the losers. Here, she is pictured with North Carolina Senator Kay Hagan, who lost by 1.7 percentage points . Hillary is seen here with Colorado Senator Mark Udall, who lost by a stunning four points on Tuesday night, despite early polls that gave him an enormous lead . Iowa Democrat Bruce Braley got trounced by eight and a half percentage points - despite Clinton's support during the election . 'Today, voters sent a message to President Obama and Hillary Clinton, rejecting their policies and many of their candidates,' he said on social media. In Kentucky, where self-proclaimed 'Clinton Democrat' Alison Lundergan Grimes unsuccessfully took on Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the election was a 'referendum not only on the president, but on Hillary Clinton,' Paul told Fox News on Tuesday night. The GOP seized control of the US Senate Tuesday night, picking up seven seats. Races in Alaska, Louisiana and Virginia, which have not been called, could give the Republicans a majority of up to 55. After presiding over the loss of the US House in a wave election in 2010 and the loss of the Senate on Tuesday night, President Barack Obama is now a lame duck for the final two years of his presidency. Republicans ran on Obama's unpopularity and the dysfunction that has taken over Washington since he was elected. Democrats, meanwhile, largely ran away from the president and did everything they could to distance themselves from him. Unlike Obama, though, candidates in tight races across the country asked Clinton to campaign for them in an attempt to energize voters. It didn't seem to work. Contender: Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul, seen here celebrating fellow-Kentcky Senator Mitch McConnell's victory, is already gearing up for a likely 2016 presidential run . Lost and lost big: Despite enormous national resources, Alison Lundergan Grimes was thrashed by Senator Mitch McConnell in Kentucky - losing by more than 15percentage points . Paul told Breitbart News: 'Somebody should ask Hillary Democrats why they got wiped out tonight. Clearly, Hillary is yesterday's news.' Clinton has not formally announced that she will run for president again in 2016, but it has been widely reported that she still harbors ambitions for the White House. She leads any other potential 2016 candidates in polls. Politico has claimed today the Clinton will now be under increasing pressure from Democrats to declare whether she is running for president. She has previously said she would not talk about running for president until after January. The results from Tuesday election have already hurt one of Clinton's key 2016 pitches, Politico reports. Clinton had been planning to campaign for the early Iowa primary by declaring that Iowans had never voted for a woman in a statewide election. Iowa state Senator Joni Ernst won the US Senate seat by eight and a half percentage points on Tuesday - becoming the first woman elected statewide. She defeated Democratic US Congressman Bruce Braley - whom Clinton campaigned for. Not everyone Hillary backed lost. New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen defeated former Senator Scott Brown. Mary Landrieu, the Senator from Louisiana, came out barely ahead of her Republican challenger and now faces a runoff. She also campaigned with Wisconsin Senator Al Franken and Michigan Senator Gary Peters, who both won. Clinton also campaigned for Senator Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire (left), who won her race, and Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu (right) - who faces a runoff after a tight campaign . In Georgia, Michelle Nunn, daughter of the former Democratic Senator, lost by by nearly eight percentage points - despite support from national Democrats . Clinton is pictured here in the US Senate in 2008 with Arkansas Senator Mark Pryor, who lost by a stunning margin of more than 17percentage points in the state where Clinton was once First Lady .","Hillary Clinton campaigned with nearly every  candidate who lost a Democratic seat in the US Senate on Tuesday .

"These magical images look like intricate works of art. But they are in fact a series of different kinds of moss which smothers trees - transforming branches into a thick spongy green layer. A nature photographer has taken the close-up photographs, showing the vast differences in pattern, colour and texture in moss around the world. Their tiny, simple leaves appear in different shapes and sizes and some are even a rustic, golden brown colour. These extreme close up photographs show the intricate detail of moss that smothers trees - transforming branches into a thick spongy green layer . A nature photographer has taken close-up photographs of the moss, showing its vast differences in pattern, colour and texture . Their tiny, simple leaves appear in different shapes and sizes and some are even a rustic, golden brown colour . Warren Krupsaw, from northern Virginia, US, has been a nature photographer for more than 50 years and took the beautiful pictures . The miniature leaves group together, and from a distance, they transform the colour of a tree from brown to green. A 100-metre tall Sitka spruce tree in the Hoh Rainforest, Washington, U.S., can be seen fully coated with the moss. Warren Krupsaw, from northern Virginia, US, has been a nature photographer for more than 50 years. The 70-year-old said: 'Moss pictures are taken whenever and wherever interesting specimens are encountered. 'From the vast moss-covered lava beds in Iceland, to mossy landscapes in Norway, to Kauai, Hawaii, to my own garden in Virginia.' The photographer said that he does not go looking specifically for moss. He added: But if encountered, I'll certainly check it out. The photographer said most people ignore it and pass it by, but 'after closer examination, unusual colours, patterns, shapes and forms reveal themselves' A 100-metre tall Sitka spruce tree in the Hoh Rainforest, Washington, US, can be seen fully coated with the moss . Mr Krupsaw, a father-of-two, said he finds moss fascinating and travels around the world capturing it in its finest light . Here the moss can be seen breaking through the slats of a roof . 'By its nature, moss requires a certain modicum of moisture so it's less likely to occur in drier environments, while also favouring warmer conditions. 'In the Hoh Rainforest, Washington, for example, the predominant Sitka Spruce that grow 100 metres tall are adorned with epiphytic moss. 'In other moist environments, moss can occur on just about any surface from concrete to roofing.' Mr Krupsaw, a father-of-two, finds moss fascinating and travels around the world capturing it in its finest light. The resulting pictures are almost unrecognisable from their subject matter, as they erupt in colour and texture . The close up of this textured moss looks almost like a forest of towering trees, swaying in the breeze . By its nature, moss requires a modicum of moisture so it is less likely to occur in drier environments, while also favouring warmer conditions . There are approximately 12,000 species of moss. While it is considered a weed in many cultures, in Japan, it is actively encouraged to grow . Mr Krupsaw said what he liked about the pictures, is that they don't look like moss at all. The incredibly detailed images make the plant appear like trees in their own right . Moss does not have flowers or seeds. Instead their simple leaves cover thin stems. It can also produce spore capsules. These appear as beak-like capsules borne aloft on thin stalks . He continued: 'It can be a fascinating subject matter due to a couple of reasons. 'Most people ignore it and pass it by, and after closer examination, unusual colours, patterns, shapes and forms reveal themselves. 'What I like about the pictures is that they don't look like moss at all.'","The close-up photographs show the vast differences in pattern, colour and texture in moss around the world .

"Investigators have confirmed that a man who burned to death at a Los Angeles Halloween party accidentally set himself on fire while light a cigarette. Video of the tragic event shows Gilbert Estrada engulfed in flames and flailing around helplessly as other party-goers continue to dance around him. Estrada had gone to the West Hollywood Carnaval dressed as a sniper in camouflage. According to the Los Angeles Times, the costume was made from burlap sacks and straw. Engulfed in flames: Gilbert Estrada is in the middle of a crowd engulfed in flames . 'It's really thin and flammable,' Los Angeles County Sheriff's Detective Richard Biddle told the Los Angeles Times. 'That stuff could ignite pretty fast.' Biddle told the Times that an bystander told investigators he saw Estrada accidentally ignite the hood of his Halloween costume while he was trying to light a cigarette. When he pulled the hood off his head, the flames spread to his back, eventually engulfing his whole body. Derek Easley was at the festival and saw the event. 'So many people were drunk and partying,' he told the Los Angeles Times. 'People were chanting, clapping, filming and taking pictures like it was some kind of cool, funny thing and not realizing it was a guy who was suffering in a really bad condition.' Sudden death: Mr Estrada's sudden death has left his family at a loss for words . Writhing in agony: Mr Estrada flails violently around in front of the crowd in a shocking video of the accident . Estrada, 51, was pronounced dead . Friday 1 November after catching fire the night before during a dance . music performance at the West . Hollywood Halloween Carnival.

But . towards the end of the one minute 41 second-long video, several people . are seen barreling through the crowd to help Mr Estrada. After . the fire is mostly stomped out, the badly ailing man attempts to crawl . forward, but collapses as many of the 500,000 attendees mock him. Finally put out: A plume of smoke rises after the flames were finally put out . ‘What the f**k are you doing?’ one person shouts. Wearing no shirt, his jeans are covered in embers, Mr Estrada is in very obvious pain, but the mocking continues. People cheer after the video taker's friends ask if he got it on camera. ‘Yeah I got that s**t on camera!’ Mr Estrada’s devastated family has set up a page for people to donate for a funeral after his sudden death. ‘On October 31st, my brother Gilbert Estrada passed away from a tragic accident he sustained while celebrating halloween at West Hollywood's Halloween Carnaval,’ the page says. ‘His costume went up in flames for reasons unknown and he suffered severe burns to his upper torso including his face.’","Gilbert Estrada's costume caught fire at the West Hollywood Halloween Carnival .

"It seems anyone who claims something is 'better than sex' are in a minority, after a study found making love is the most enjoyable human activity. Researchers  used text messaging to build up a map of what activities people routinely rated as bringing the most and least happiness to their daily lives. They found that sex ranked first in all three categories measured in the . survey: Pleasure, meaning and engagement. Sex tops the survey: Making love was found to provide the most pleasure and meaning of all daily activities . Drinking alcohol or partying came second in terms of pleasure but only 10th in terms of meaning. Feeling sick was lowest rated in terms of pleasure, while surprisingly using Facebook rated last in meaning. The study was compiled by Carsten Grimm from the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. With depression levels hitting all-time highs in western societies everyone from academics to governments have become interested in ways to measure and track happiness. He said: 'So . far governments around the world and media have focused mainly on life . satisfaction in the discussion about well-being; it turns out happiness . is a far more complicated topic. 'One . of the areas I’m researching - orientations to happiness - looks at . whether there are different ways of going about seeking happiness. 'Psychologists . have proposed that individuals may seek to increase their well-being . through three main behavioural orientations; via pleasure, via . engagement, and via meaning. 'Endorsing pleasure as a way to happiness means you enjoy 'eating dessert first' or you focus on feeling good and enjoying sensory pleasures. 'Engagement is what you experience when you’re totally absorbed in what you’re doing; either skiing down a hill or being immersed in your work. People call this experience a state of flow and this may be a dominant orientation to happiness for some people. 'Having meaning in a person’s life was a way to pursue happiness; being part of something bigger and contributing to the greater good.' Mr Grimm used mobile-phone text-messaging to collect data on what people did during the day and how they felt about it, a technique called 'experience sampling'. 'I texted people three times a day over a week and the response rate was really high,' he said. 'People are never far from their cellphones these days. People replied to on average 97 percent of all text-messages, and texts were sent at random times, so there is a really rich sample of everyday life to look at. 'From my research I can see what activities are routinely rated as highest and lowest in people's daily lives. Having sex is (no surprise) highest on all measures of happiness. 'Being sick is again, no surprise, relatively low on all  measures. Going to lectures, or studying, is low on pleasure and happiness, but ranks relatively high on meaning. 'The results have implications for what psychologists have called `the full life’. 'Those who tend to be high on all three orientations to happiness not only score high on life satisfaction, they also tend to have higher experiences of pleasure, meaning, engagement and happiness in their daily lives. 'This means that being able to seek happiness in different ways may enrich your everyday experience and increase your overall well-being. 'This is a fascinating area of study and one I am really excited to be a part of. Hopefully as we learn more about what contributes to a full life we can help people increase their happiness in their daily lives.'","Sex ranked first in the three happiness categories of pleasure, meaning and engagement .

"This is the mother who murdered her young son then set him on fire when he struggled to learn the Koran off by heart. Pictured for the first time, Sara Ege, 32, leaves court today preparing to face life imprisonment after being found guilty of murder. Ege, 32, used a stick to beat her seven-year-old son Yaseen 'like a dog' when he couldn’t recite passages from the Islamic holy book. Murderer: Sara Ege, pictured for the first time, beat her son Yaseen to death with a stick before burning down the house . A . court heard the beatings were so brutal he died from his injuries and . his mother tried to burn the body to destroy the evidence. Fun-loving Yaseen was originally thought to have died in a tragic accident in the house fire. But a post mortem examination showed Ege had been beating and abusing her little boy in the months leading up to his murder. Prosecutor Ian Murphy said: 'When the smoke had cleared it emerged that Yaseen was dead before the fire had started. 'He had suffered significant abdominal injuries that were the cause of his death. 'There were multiple injuries including fractures which were non-accidental. 'Sara Ege made no attempt to seek the medical attention he so obviously needed. 'He clearly suffered terribly. She started the fire to hide what she had done.' In a police interview Ege told officers she was trying to teach her son the Koran but he was not very good. Beaten: Yaseen Ali, seven, was beaten by his mother for failing to learn parts of the Koran by heart . University graduate Ege said: 'I was getting more and more frustrated, if he didn’t read it properly I would be very angry - I would hit him. 'We had a high target, I wanted him to learn 35 pages in three months. I promised him a new bike if he could do it. 'But Yaseen wasn’t very good - after a year of practice he had only learned a chapter.' Cardiff Crown Court heard Ege and her taxi driver husband Yousef, 38, had enrolled Yaseen in advanced classes at their local mosque. They wanted him to become Hafiz - an Islamic term for someone who memorises the Koran. Ege told the court: 'Memorising the whole of Koran is a great reward for the whole family. 'It brings honour and increases the standing of the whole family in the local community.' But mischievous Yaseen preferred to play with his friends and got behind with his studies. The schoolboy was coming to the end of a three-month trial period at the mosque and Ege was keen for him to impress his Imam. The court heard Ege become more and more frustrated with her son’s inability to learn the passages he needed to. She told officers: 'I was getting all this bad stuff in my head, like I couldn’t concentrate, I was getting angry too much, I would shout at Yaseen all the time. A sketch shows Sara Ege sitting in the dock at Cardiff Crown Court. She has been found guilty of her son's murder today . 'I was getting very wild and I hit Yaseen with a stick on his back like a dog. 'He would be doing his work and wouldn’t complain and I would hit and hit him more and more. 'He was a good boy but I used to get angry and he wouldn’t even stop me or say anything to anyone.' The court was told how Ege would hit Yaseen with a stick, a hammer, a rolling pin and a slipper as well as repeatedly punching him. In the months after Yaseen’s death Ege told her GP she had been told to kill him by Shaitan - an Islamic name for the devil. She said: 'It is Shaitan - it is the devil which is telling me to do all these bad things. 'I have become so harsh, I even killed my own son.' Ege told her doctor she felt '100 per cent better' after her seven-year-old son died. Notes . kept by her GP record her as saying: 'It is like something has been . released. For three or four months I have not been normal. 'Voices told me to hit Yaseen and then hit him more and more.' Police . and the fire service were called to the family’s home in Pontcanna, . Cardiff, in July 2010 after a blaze ripped through the top floor. Yaseen was pulled from the blaze by firefighters who fought to revive the schoolboy. At first Yaseen’s death in the fire was treated as a tragic accident. But a post mortem examination discovered Yaseen was dead before the blaze began. Pathologists found multiple injuries on Yaseen’s body including broken ribs, a fractured arm and a fractured finger. Funeral: Cardiff Crown Court has heard Ege grew increasingly frustrated with her seven-year-old son . Tragedy: Ege hit her child with a hammer, a rolling pin and a slipper as well as punching him repeatedly . Barbecue lighter fuel was found on Ege’s clothing when she was arrested after the post mortem examination. Ege initially denied murdering Yaseen and burning his body to hide what she had done. Later she said she burned her son’s body after discovering he had died in the house and panicked. Her story changed again when she admitted beating little Yaseen in the months leading up to his death and burning his body to hide the injuries. Ege's husband Yousef Ege pictured outside Cardiff Crown Court. The five-week trial heard Mr Ege would drive Yaseen to mosque for his Koran practice before and after school. He said he had never seen his wife raise a hand against Yaseen . But Ege finally retracted all her previous confessions and told police they had all been lies. She said her husband and his family had threatened to kill her and her family is she didn’t take the blame for her son’s death. Her husband denied causing or allowing the death of a child by not stopping his wife’s beatings of Yaseen. The five-week trial heard Mr Ege would drive Yaseen to mosque for his Koran practice before and after school. He said he had never seen his wife raise a hand against Yaseen and that she was a 'perfect mother'. He told police: 'The last time I saw my son he looked fine. 'He was very happy and had written out a list of things he was going to do in the summer holidays.' Ege was found guilty of murder and perverting the course of justice by burning little Yaseen’s body. Her husband was cleared of causing or allowing the death of a child by failing to protect him. The jury returned unanimous verdicts after eight hours of deliberation. As the verdict was read out Ege broke down in the dock, holding her head in her hands and crying. Her husband showed no emotion as he walked free from court. Ege’s parents, who had travelled from Hyderabad in India, sat in the public gallery quietly as the jury returned. Judge Justice Wyn Williams told Ege she faces a term of life imprisonment . But he said he would determine a minimum sentence in the New Year after a medical report had been completed. Sara Ege remains in medical custody at the Llanarth Court Hospital in Gwent, South Wales. Scene: Police and firefighters rushed to the family home in Pontcanna, Cardiff, after the blaze broke out in July 2010 . Mr Ege’s solicitor said outside the court: 'He would like to thank everyone for the support they given him.' The lawyer was asked if Mr Ege had any thoughts for his wife but he refused to answer before the two men got into a waiting car. Police and the Crown Prosecution Service paid a tribute to 'bright and friendly' Yaseen. Speaking outside court Detective Constable Kim Roche said: 'Throughout this investigation we have heard many tributes to Yaseen. 'Quiet, hardworking, bright, well-behaved, obedient, respectful, polite and smiley are just some of the words used to describe him. 'It is a tragedy that such a promising young life was taken and those that loved him most will not be able to see him grow up to be a young man.' District Crown Prosecutor Deborah Rogers said: “The deeply tragic nature of this case has been all too apparent to anyone that has followed this trial. 'We should not forget that at the heart of the case is the loss of a bright and friendly young boy who had his whole life ahead of him.'","Sara Ege is facing life sentence after being found guilty of murder .

In January, former New York prosecutor Steven Pagones filed court papers seeking the $431,000 he is owed by Tawana Brawley, who, as a 15-year-old, falsely labeled him a 'gang-raping, kidnapping racist.' Last week, Brawley sent him her first payment - 10 checks totaling $3,764.61 - after the Virginia court ordered the money garnisheed from the nurse's wages. It comes 15 years after a court ruled that she defamed him with her nasty hoax. 'It's a long time coming,' Pagones, 52, told The New York Post. The ex-prosecutor said he remains more interested in extracting a confession from Brawley than the money she owes. 'Every week, she'll think of me. And every week, she can think about how she has a way out — she can simply tell the truth.' Brawley's advisers in the case — the Reverend Al Sharpton, and attorneys C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox — have already paid, or are paying their debt to Pagones. Until now, Brawley, 41, has refused to pay out but she is now forced to cough up $627 each month to the man who is one of three whose name she dragged through the mud in 1987, possibly for the rest of her life. 'Finally, she's paying something,' Pagones' attorney, Gary Bolnick told The Post. 'Symbolically, I think it's very important — you can't just do this stuff without consequences.' On . November 28, 1987, the then-15-year-old was found in a trash bag, . dazed, smeared with feces with the word 'n****r' scrawled on her body. Here to collect: Pagones says he would consider dropping his demand for money if Brawley admits she made up her story against him . 'For at least 25 years, she has . been living a major lie,' Pagones said in January. 'To me, this has always been . about responsibility and accountability.' She told police she had been abducted by . two white men and driven to the woods where they and four others . ravaged her for four days - one of which had a badge. The case was catapulted onto the . national stage by her attorneys Alton H. Maddox and C. Vernon Mason, and the . then-little-known Rev Al Sharpton, who claimed she was raped 33 times. Brawley, who now goes by the name Tawana Gutierrez, is a single mom working as a nurse in . Virginia. She may now have as much as 25 percent of her wages garnished to repay Pagones, his lawyer, Garry Bolnick, told the New York Post. 'People . criticize me for going after a hardworking single mother trying to . support herself and child,' Pagones said. 'My argument has been she has . not been held accountable.' 'If . she is not going to tell the truth, then it is about the money. That is . the only way to hold her accountable,” said Pagones, who is now . principal owner of a private investigations firm. Sensational: The Brawley case was massive and the young girl graced the cover of numerous magazines and newspapers including People, pictured . Racial tensions: Rev Al Sharpton catapulted the case of Tawana Brawley, center, onto the main stage and made him a household name across the country . Historic case: Reverend Al Sharpton, pictured in 1988, picketed outside the hotel of New York governor Mario Cuomo . The Brawley case was a national . scandal and had celebrities weighing in, with Bill Cosby posting a . $25,000 reward for information on the case. Don King promised $100,000 for Brawley’s education and boxer Mike Tyson gave her a $30,000 watch to ease her pain. Fishkill Police Officer Harry Crist . Jr. was implicated after being found dead in his apartment a week after . Brawley was discovered, and Pagones was also accused when he stepped in . with an alibi for the 28-year-old. But in 1988 a grand jury found the whole shocking story was a hoax, and Brawley was never raped. Now 40 years old, The New York Post tracked her down working as a nurse in Virginia. 'I . don't want to talk to anyone about that,' Brawley told the newspaper . recently as she emerged from her apartment in Hopewell, Virginia, . wearing scrubs. She lives what appears to be a relatively normal life in a neatly kept brick apartment complex with signs warning of video surveillance cameras. To avoid detection, Brawley goes by the aliases of Thompson and Gutierrez and has a young daughter, a neighbor told the Post. False claims: Brawley, pictured in 1988, claimed she was gang raped by a group of white men, one of whom had a badge . Rally: Tawana Brawley, left in 1988, of Wappinger Falls, N.Y., was the center of the legal controversy over her rape charges . She reportedly works as a licensed practical nurse at The Laurels of Bon Air in Richmond. But her co-workers have been in the dark about the incredible story of brutality, which turned out to be false. 'Are . you serious? We don't know her by that name. Isn't that a trip?' one . staffer said, adding that the woman who they call Tawana Gutierrez was . 'a good worker.' According to a neighbor, Brawley has lived in Hopewell - Virginia's most crime-laden town - for at least a year. 'Tawana V. Gutierrez' and 'Tawana V. Thompson' have held the same nursing license since 2006, state records show. The Virginia Board of Nursing confirmed issuing it to a 'Tawana Vacenia Thompson Gutierrez.' Brawley maintains a PO box in Claremont, Va., under the name Gutierrez, according to The Post's sources. The grand jury panel, which heard from 180 witnesses over its seven-month investigation, found that Brawley made up the story to avoid being punished for staying out late and missing school. They found evidence she had ran away from home and was hiding out in her parents' former apartment after they got evicted. We believe you: The case polarised New York City in the late 1980s . Lawsuit: Brawley, pictured in 1997, spoke at a rally in support of Alton Maddox who lost a lawsuit for defamation of character by Steven Pagones . Many believed that Brawley feared her stepdad Ralph King's and needed an alibi for her absence. King spent seven years in prison in the 1970s for killing his first wife. Traces . of the charcoal-like material used to scrawl the hateful word on her . body were found under her fingernails, and she showed no signs of . genital trauma or exposure, the jury found. One witness said Brawley was . spotted climbing into the bin bag. 'It is probable that in the history of this state, never has a teenager turned the prosecutorial and judicial systems literally upside down with such false claims,' state Supreme Court Justice S. Barrett Hickman wrote at the time. Pagones has tried to forget the sorry affair but says he can't. 'It'll come up randomly. It'll come up when something happens with Sharpton,' he told The Post. Pagones won a defamation lawsuit against Sharpton, Brawley and her lawyers in 1998. Maddox was found liable for $97,000, Mason for $188,000, and Sharpton was ordered to pay $66,000. Brawley was ordered to pay $190,000 at 9 per cent annual interest but hasn't paid any of that bill. 'Through her silence, she's as guilty of libel as Maddox, Mason and Sharpton,' he told the newspaper. 'The only way to hold her accountable — at least at this stage — is financially.'","Brawley, 41, last week paid the first of many checks to Steven Pagones whom she owes hundreds of thousands of dollars .

"An Ohio Amish girl diagnosed with leukemia who had fled the U.S. with her family to avoid chemotherapy has been cured after being treated with natural remedies in Central America, according to her grandfather. Doctors fought the family's decision to end chemotherapy, saying Sarah Hershberger would die without it within six months. Issac Keim told the Akron Beacon Journal that his granddaughter Sarah recently celebrated her 11th birthday and seems vibrant and healthy. Disappeared: The Hershbergers fled their farm in Homer Township, Ohio,  to avoid their daughter Sarah getting treatment, which they say is making her sick and are worried it will make her 'infertile' According to Mr Keim, blood and imaging tests indicated that Sarah’s cancer is gone. The . family's attorney said the Hershbergers fled home in northeast Ohio's . Medina County at one point, leaving the U.S. at one point to avoid . having to resume chemotherapy treatments. A state appeals court has appointed a guardian to take over Sarah's medical decisions. Keim . said the family and their baby sitter have since returned to the U.S. but remain in hiding amid the ongoing legal battle over Sarah's care. Meanwhile, the couple's five other children are being cared for by the family's tight-knit Amish community, where Mr Keim is a bishop. Isaac Keim told the paper this week that Andy and Anna Hershberger fled to an unspecified holistic cancer treatment center in Central America. Sarah is continuing treatments with natural products, according to her grandfather, and is now 'cancer-free.' Scroll down for more . Anna and Andy Hershberger have been fighting a hospital in court for months after they decided to halt the treatments because they couldn't continue to watch their child undergo the arduous radiation treatment. It has emerged they left their home in rural northeast Ohio just days before a state appeals court appointed a guardian in October to take over medical decisions for Sarah, according to Maurice Thompson, an attorney with the non-profit firm The 1851 Center for Constitutional Law, which has filed a brief in support of the family. 'They don't want Sarah to be taken away,' he said. County Sheriff Tom Miller said his office has no idea where the Hershbergers might be and is not actively searching for the family. 'It would take a court order for us to get involved,' Miller said to the Medina Gazette, 'and I’m not anticipating a court order.' Doctors at Akron Children's Hospital believe Sarah's leukemia is treatable, but say she will die without chemotherapy. The hospital went to court after the family decided to stop chemotherapy and treat Sarah with natural medicines, such as herbs and vitamins. Can be treated: Doctors at Akron Children's Hospital believe Sarah's leukemia is treatable, but say she will die within a year if she halts chemotherapy . An appeals court ruling in October gave attorney Maria Schimer, who's also a registered nurse limited guardianship over Sarah and the power to make medical decisions for her. The court said the beliefs and convictions of her parents can't outweigh the rights of the state to protect the child. Dropped the case: The court-appointed guardian, Maria Schimer, who is also a registered nurse, has dropped her attempt to force Amish girl, Sarah Hershberger, 11, to have chemotherapy treatment . The family has appealed the decision . to both the appeals court and the Ohio Supreme Court. They also plan to . file a motion to terminate the guardianship. They have not had any contact with the guardian since the ruling, said Clair Dickinson, the guardian's attorney. A . taxi was sent to the family's home nearly two months ago after the . guardian was appointed to take the Sarah to the hospital in Akron, but . someone at the home said the family was not there, Dickinson said. There . are no plans to ask the court to find the family or force the girl into . chemotherapy while the case is being appealed, he said. He . said Sarah's last known chemotherapy session was in June, and that . doctors have said she could die within a year if treatments don't . resume. 'I'm very concerned about her,' he said. Clair Dickinson, an attorney representing Schimer, said he didn’t know the family’s whereabouts. 'All I know is that she and her parents don’t seem to be at her house,' he said. Thompson said the girl has undergone . alternative-therapy treatments and is doing well. The family told him . that she has more energy and that CT scans show the treatments are . working. Andy Hershberger, . the girl's father, said this past summer that the family agreed to begin . two years of treatments for Sarah last spring but stopped a second . round of chemotherapy in June because it was making her extremely sick. Traditions: Sarah Hershberger (who is not pictured) and her family are Amish, and their beliefs force them to shun technology and in turn, some forms of modern medicine . Sarah begged her parents to stop the chemo and they agreed after a great deal of prayer, Hershberger said. The family, members of an insular Amish community, shun many facets of modern life and are deeply religious. They live on a farm and operate a produce stand near the village of Spencer in Medina County, about 35 miles southwest of Cleveland. Hospital officials have said they are morally and legally obligated to make sure the girl receives proper care. The hospital's attorney Maria Schimer, who is also a registered nurse, is now appealed in August to be granted limited guardianship so that she is in charge of making medical decisions for Sarah. 'The plan presented by Sarah’s parents is almost certain to lead to Sarah’s death,' she wrote in a letter to the court. 'Every day that goes by without treatment, Sarah’s chance of surviving her cancer is diminished.' With chemotherapy, her chances of survival increase to 85 per cent.","The Amish parents of Sarah Hershberger, now 11, fled their home in Ohio to a clinic in Central America .

"A mysterious person has been photographed for the first time after apparently wandering around a patch of woodland for the past 10 years. The figure, who is known as 'Le Loyon' and has been called Switzerland's answer to the Loch Ness Monster, wears a military uniform and a thick cloak, with a gas mask covering his or her face. While he does not seem to be obviously aggressive or dangerous, police are hoping to speak to Le Loyon in an effort to encourage him to be less threatening. Tales of Le Loyon have been reported in the woods of Maules in western Switzerland for the past decade, apparently walking the same route every day. Spotted: 'Le Loyon' has been photographed for the first time after a decade spent wandering the woods . However, last month Le Matin published what is believed to be the first ever photograph of the figure. 'I came across him near the marches,' said the unnamed amateur photographer who tracked him down. 'I approached him up to a dozen metres away. 'He had a military cape, boots and an army gas mark - an antique type, I think. He measured more than 1.90m. He stared at me then turned his back on me and left in silence.' One local resident encountered Le Loyon in June last year - when the creature appeared to be clutching a bunch of flowers. Marianne Descloux, who also lives in the area, told Le Matin that her run-in with him came in spring. 'It was a rainy Sunday,' she said. 'He had a cap, a dark cloak and his gas mask. 'What could possibly be going through his head? I don't know, but it was unforgettable - and unpleasant. I hope I don't run into him again.' Scary: Many locals are now reluctant to visit the forest of Maules in western Switzerland . Others testified that Le Loyon had terrified their children with his unusual appearance, while it is said that some women are scared to visit the woods alone. 'Families simply won't go into the forest any more,' a farmer said, adding that Le Loyon had been seen regularly over 10 years. 'No one here finds this story funny.' There have been a number of theories as to the figure's true identity - a mentally ill woman, a gigantic man, or someone suffering from a nasty skin condition. Others suggest that Le Loyon has deliberately chosen a hermit's life, perhaps because he is a 'survivalist' obsessed with the apocalypse. Despite the terror felt by many at coming face-to-face with the mysterious wanderer, he has never shown signs of aggression - but local authorities are keen to get in touch with Le Loyon to reassure their constituents' fears. 'The situation is delicate because we basically have nothing against this person,' said Guy Savary, the municipal official in charge of forests. 'But since he arouses these fears, we are going to hold meeting to see if we can find a way of locating him, and discouraging him from behaving as he does.'","'Le Loyon' has been haunting the woods of Maules for a decade .

"Millions of Britons are living in 'rabbit hutch' family homes that have halved in size since the 1920s, it was revealed today. The average semi-detached house now has one less bedroom and is much more ‘cramped, dark and artificially lit’ than those built in the early 20th century. In 1920, average homes usually measured 1,647 square feet and boasted four bedrooms, but today’s equivalent has three bedrooms and is 925 square feet, according to the Institution of British Architects. More than 90 years ago the millions of three bedroom homes built for Britain's burgeoning middle classes were also markedly larger than those today. Modern life: A row of new semi-detached three-bedroom homes in Wiltshire, which generally are around half the size of those built in the 1920s . Spot the difference: This 1920s suburban semi-detached house in north London was built in a period where homes were bigger . RIBA's research has found that the average one bedroom flat is now the same size as a London Underground tube carriage. And average terraced homes have also shrunk - from three bedrooms with 1,020 square feet, to two bedrooms and 645 square feet. Overall Britain now has the smallest homes on average in Europe and the abolition of the minimum space standards through the 1980 Local Government, Planning and Land Act is to blame, Riba says. Three-bedroom home today: These floor plans show how houses often have a combined kitchen and dining room while upstairs there are only two decent bedrooms and one box room with room for a single bed . Contrast: The rooms of this three-bedroom home in Petts Wood, south-east London, were longer, wider and had bay windows, with much more storage as well . Experts have warned the lack of space and light in modern homes could cause marital problems and even stop children from reaching their full potential at school. Developers could be forced to build homes to new minimum space standards as the government called for an end to the spread of ‘rabbit hutch homes’. Under a proposed radical shake up of building rules, developers could be made to construct homes to a specific size or above. Ministers are concerned that new homes are being built to half the size they were 80 years ago across Britain. How we live today: Thhe average UK one-bed flat (left), equates to living in a London Tube carriage (right) Surveys from the Royal Institute of British Architects show that 60 per cent of people who would never consider a new home are turned off by the size of the rooms. Some 80 per cent said they would be more likely to choose a home that met minimum space standards. Communities minister Don Foster yesterday launched a consultation to simplify housing standards. He promised to slash red tape for house builders, scrapping up to 90 per cent of existing restrictions. Stark: Britons are living in the smallest homes in Western Europe and it is making us ill and unhappy, RIBA says . But the consultation also warns that the government could bring in new minimum standards on space to meet the growing demand from families for larger homes. The 1920s changed the face of Britain forever with an explosion in new houses, mainly for the growing middle classes. After the end of the First World War planners constructed new estates, mainly in suburban areas, and the majority were made up of semi-detached houses built in pairs. In 1920 there were eight million homes in Britain and within 15 years this had risen to 12 million. Many of these properties were designed for modern life, with larger kitchens, dining rooms and bedrooms, as well as spacious gardens for children to play in. It also coincided with the growth in the great British cul-de-sac. The majority of these new homes were built along or close to the UK's railway lines, making it possible for residents to commute to their nearest town or city centres for work and leisure activities. A typical semi in London cost £750 93 years ago and anyone who could afford one was considered a 'high-flyer'. Local authorities could also ask . developers to make homes more friendly for the elderly or . wheelchair-bound with new ‘access’ requirements. Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, has attacked the way families are ‘trapped in rabbit hutch homes’. He blamed the move towards smaller homes on Labour policy, which decreed that at least 30 homes had to be built on every hectare of land. Ministers see the tighter restrictions as pay back for helping the homebuilding sector to recover. Government policies such as the controversial help to buy mortgage scheme are expected to fuel the building sector and they now want developers to give something back to communities. In return, ministers will reduce more than 1,500 pages of guidance to fewer than 80, a move they claim will save builders time and money. Mr Foster said: ‘At a time when we are working closely with British business to create jobs and build a stronger economy it’s essential the government plays its part by taking off the bureaucratic handbrake that holds back house building and adds unnecessary cost. I’m proposing to cut needless red tape to let house builders get on with the real job of building the high quality new homes that people need, especially families and first time buyers.’ He added: 'The current mish-mash of housing standards means that from Allerdale in Cumbria to Zoar in Cornwall no same set of rules always applies - it’s confusing, bureaucratic and cannot be allowed to continue.’ Some of the standards facing abolition include requiring rainwater harvesting in places where there is no water shortage, demanding solar panels or windmills on homes where they cannot physically fit, requirements to build accessible flats on floors that cannot be reached by disabled people, and demanding bigger windows to allow for dirt on them rather than assuming homeowners will simply clean them to allow in more light.'","Average homes 90 years ago usually measured 1,647 .

"China and Japan are constantly struggling over territory, politics and economic dominance - but now it appears the two Asian giants could have found another topic to fight about. Earlier this month a Japanese man was officially declared the world's oldest living person at 115, but China is fielding an alternative candidate for the title. This week an official news agency repeated claims that a Chinese woman is 127 years old, which would make her the record-holder by a large margin. Contest: Jiroemon Kimura, left, and Luo Meizhen, right, both claim to be the world's oldest living person . Jiroemon Kimura, a former postman who was born on April 19, 1897, was named the world's oldest person by Guinness World Records after the death of American Dina Manfredini. He lives in Kyotango and has 14 grandchildren, 25 great-grandchildren and 13 great-great-grandchildren. Mr Kimura is the second oldest man ever whose age has been officially verified. However, just a few days ago the Xinhua agency reported on Luo Meizhen, a woman who claims to have turned 127 in September. Official: Mr Kimura was declared the world's oldest by Guinness World Records earlier this month . Celebration: Mr Kimura is handed a bouquet of flowers by a nurse as he is declared the record holder . Ms Luo lives in Guangxi region's Bama county, an area famous for the longevity of its residents.

Celebration: Ms Luo with her family on what she claimed was her 127th birthday in September . If Ms Luo is truly 127, that would make her the oldest person ever to have lived, beating Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997 aged 122. It is unclear how aggressively China intends to pursue the centenarian's record claim, but it has the potential to become another bone of contention between the country and its rival power. Even if Ms Luo does not manage to wrest the title from Mr Kimura, interest in her home county will doubtless continue as it draws thousands of visitors seeking to discover the secret behind the long lives of its 74 residents aged more than 100.","Japan's Jiroemon Kimura is officially world's oldest living person at 115 .

"Former President Bill Clinton divulged on Wednesday that it took former secretary of state Hillary Clinton 'six months of very serious work' last year to recover from a fainting spell in December 2012 that resulted in a concussion and blood clot. Her long recovery is 'something she never low-balled,' Bill said. But Bill's timeline contradicts the State Department's claims just after the conclusion of Hillary's treatment in January 2013  that 'she seems to be fully recovered.' Picture of health: Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton waves to the audience at the conclusion of her address to the American Jewish Committee (AJC) Global Forum in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday. Clinton has been traveling the country, giving speeches since July 2013 - six months after the State Department said she had 'fully recovered' from her accident in December 2012 . Hillary . Clinton took ill at some point the week of December 9, 2012,  just as she was supposed to testify . before a Congressional committee about the terrorist attack that took . four American lives in Benghazi, Libya three months before. After falling in her home, Clinton incurred a concussion. The State . Department did not say what day the accident occurred, but it described . her concussion on December 13 as 'not severe.' It . was not until December 15 that State explained Clinton's accident was . related to a stomach virus that caused her to become dehydrated and . faint. At . that time, a State Department spokesman claimed that Clinton would be . working from home the following week and would be 'staying in regular . contact with Department and other . officials.' Clinton . continued to stay at home for the following two weeks, and on December . 30, a State Department spokesman announced that he had found a blood . clot 'in the course of a follow-up exam' and that she was being 'treated with anti-coagulants and is at New York-Presbyterian . Hospital so that they can monitor the medication over the next 48 hours.' The . following day, Clinton's doctor's released a statement describing the . location of the clot as in 'the vein that is situated in the space . between the . brain and the skull behind the right ear.' 'It did not result in a . stroke, or neurological damage,' the statement said. On January 2, doctors sent Clinton home from the hospital, and on January 7, Clinton returned to work. It was on Clinton's first day back in the office that State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said that 'judging by the woman we saw this morning and the workload that she’s got she seems to be fully recovered.' Clinton did not appear before Congress . until the following month, leading some Republicans to speculate about . the timing and seriousness of her hospitalization.

Hillary Clinton leaves New York Presbyterian Hospital with husband, Bill (TOP), and daughter, Chelsea (RIGHT) on January 2, 2013. The secretary of state was under treatment for a blood clot that stemmed from a concussion she suffered in mid-December . Former George W. Bush adviser Karl . Rove reignited the debate about Hillary's physical and mental condition last week when he . suggested at a conference that she was hiding something about her . health. 'Thirty days in the . hospital?' Rove said, according to the New York Post. 'And when she reappears, she's wearing glasses that are only for . people who have traumatic brain injury? We need to know what's up with . that.' The Post insinuated that Rove claimed Hillary may be suffering from brain damage as a result of the clot. 'Karl Rove has deceived the country for years, but there . are no words for this level of lying,'  Clinton spokesman Nick . Merrill fired back. 'She is 100%. Period,' he said of Hillary's heath. Rove told Fox News on Tuesday he never said Hillary had brain damage. 'She . had a serious health episode and my point was . that I think it was from the 7th of December in 2012 through the 7th of . January of 2013, she underwent, first she had apparently a serious . virus,' he said after being confronted with the fact that the former . secretary of state was only in the hospital for three days, not 30 days. After Rove explained his comments on Fox, Merrill accused Republicans of politicizing Hillary's health. 'First they . accused her of faking it, now they've resorted to the other extreme -- . and are flat out lying,' he said. 'Even this morning, Karl Rove is still all over . the map and is continuing to get the facts wrong. But he doesn't care, . because all he wants to do is inject the issue into the echo chamber, . and he's succeeding. It's flagrant and thinly veiled.' Former President Bill Clinton divulged on Wednesday that it took former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton six months to recover from a fainting spell that led to a concussion and blood clot in late 2012 . Speaking at an event in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday, Bill Clinton said he was 'sort of dumbfounded' by Republicans' on going questions about Hillary's health. Clinton said they would do 'whatever it takes' to sully her political career, and 'there was nothing to' claims she was untruthful about her health issues. 'They went to all this trouble to say she had staged what was a terrible . concussion that required six months of very serious work to get over,' he said. 'It’s something she never low-balled with the American people, . never tried to pretend it didn’t happen.” Clinton laughed Hillary's critics off, saying, 'You can’t be too upset about it.' 'It’s just the beginning. They’ll get better and better about it,' he said. 'It’s just part of the deal.' As for Rove, Clinton said, 'I got to give him . credit, you know, that embodies that old saying that consistency is the . hobgoblin of little minds.' Clinton said his wife was in good health. 'Look, she works out every week. She is strong. She is doing . great,' Clinton said according to Buzzfeed. 'As far as I can tell, she’s in better shape than I am.' Hillary left the State Department in February of 2013, less than a month after returning in the wake of her accident. She hit the . speaking circuit just five months later in July of 2013. The presumed 2016 candidate has spent the last year . giving speeches on he own behalf and on behalf of the Clinton Foundation . and working on her memoir, Hard Choices, which comes out in June. She was also in Washington for a speech, yesterday. Unlike her husband, she did not discuss the controversy surrounding her recovery, however.","Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suffered a concussion and blood clot in December 2012, for which she was hospitalized for three days .

"The family of a blind woman who killed her healthy guide dog so it could be buried alongside her have suffered a hate campaign and received death threats, it was revealed today. Shelia Stadler, 68, from Terre Haute, Indiana, died of cancer with her five-year-old guide dog Toffee by her side last month. A few days later later her son Andy had the healthy dog put down so it could placed in Mrs Stadler's coffin to fulfil her dying wish. But the controversial decision to destroy the dog has provoked a huge backlash in the town with Mrs Stadler's son receiving death threats - and even suffering abuse from members of his own family. Heartbroken: Sheila Stadle apparently couldn't bear to part with her guide dog when she died . Faithful companion: Healthy five-year old Toffee was apparently put to sleep and buried at the request of his owner (file picture) 'How could they do it?' Gregory Reilly from the Honey Creek Animal Hospital was wrongly implicated as having put the dog down, and believes the decision to do so was questionable . Gregory Reilly, a veterinary assistant with the local Honey Creek Animal Hospital, said: 'It got totally out of control. The neighborhood was really angry. People were saying they should burn in hell. Terrible things were said. 'Mr Stadler told me he had received death threats and a member of his own family wrote on a Facebook page that she could not believe he had done it.' Mr Reilly was also caught up in the furore after being blamed wrongly for putting Toffee down. He said: 'We would never euthanise a dog - we simply find them a new home. All I did was try to find out whether what the Stadler's did was legal. 'It seems very morbid to me but unfortunately as the dog was their property, it was perfectly legal.' Mrs Stadler died on March 8, and had expressed a wish to her family that she should be buried with her beloved labrador Toffee. Her son Andrew, a tax accountant, then carried out her instructions after saying the dog had shown signs of mourning and 'wandered aimlessly' in the days after Mrs Stadler died. It is not known when Toffee was euthanized but the story first emerged on WTHITV, which stated: 'Shelia Stadler, 68, of Brazil, died March 8 at home with her service animal, Toffee, at her side. 'Days later, the Stadler family had Toffee, a perfectly healthy 5-year-old dog, euthanized, displayed in the coffin at Shelia’s visitation, and buried with her in Summit Lawn Cemetery right outside Brazil.' In mourning: DeBaun Funeral Homes and Crematory's obituary said that Toffee had been Sheila's 'constant companion for five years' It cited an obituary saying: 'She loved Toffee, her seeing-eye dog and constant companion for five years.' But when the report provoked a storm of criticism against Mrs Stadler's family, station boss Todd Webber withdrew the story from the website and refused to comment on the reasons why. Mr Reilly said: 'The family and the station have taken a lot of heat on this. There was a Facebook page with so much criticism on that they had to take it down.' The Dogs Trust said:  'There is never any reason to put a . healthy dog to sleep when it could be happily rehomed. 'We hope that . this sad story could never be repeated in the UK. Guide Dogs UK also made it . clear that this case was unacceptable. Oliver Barton, regional director, said: 'We would never condone this. Whatever happens, we would make sure that the dog was happy and cared for' Paying tribute to Mrs Stadler, the . DeBaun Funeral Home refused to comment on its involvement in displaying the euthanized dog but said that she had been a 'dedicated homemaker' whose . favourite book was the Bible. Mrs Stadler is not the only owner to request such a burial in recent years. NBC reported that Tom Tom, a healthy 2-year-old Yorkshire terrier was put down so that he could be buried with his owner, Donald Ellis from Arkansas. His sister said that she had 'a lot of grief for doing this, but it’s what my brother wanted.' Emily Kinney from Dallas, Texas told NBC that her grandmother asked for her Shih-tzu Sam to be buried in her coffin. She said that 'she wanted her best friend with her'.","Sheila Stadler requested healthy five-year-old Toffee be put down .

"Aliens are real - not little green men visiting Earth as depicted in movies, but rather microbial life in our own solar system and intelligent life beyond. That’s according to two leading Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (Seti) researchers, who yesterday took part in a hearing at the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology in Washington DC. During the talk dubbed ‘Astrobiology and the Search for Life in the Universe’, the scientists laid out the evidence and reasoning for believing we are not alone. Dr Seth Shostak (stock image shown) and Dr Dan Werthimer of the Seti Institute yesterday laid out their research to Congress regarding the search for alien life. They say with adequate funding it is almost a certainty we will find alien life in 20 years, be it intelligent or microbial . The hearing was arranged to review the current state of the science related to the search for life in the universe. Dr Seth Shostak, Senior Astronomer at the Seti Institute in California, and Dr Dan Wethimer, Directory of Seti Research at the University of California Berkeley, both laid out the science and requested more funding to continue the search. In 1959, . Cornell physicists Gieuseppi Cocconi and Philip Morrison published an . article discussing the potential to use microwave radio to communicate . between stars. A . year later in 1960, astronomer Frank Drake conducted the first hunt for . alien life with an 85-foot (25 metres) antenna in West Virgina, but . after two months concedes defeat.In the 1960s, Soviet Union performs extensive searches for ET, again with no success. In the 1970s Nasa began to take an interest in Seti, with the chances of success seemingly growing as technology advanced. In 1988, Nasa began sweeping surveys of the night sky for signals, but Congress terminated funding a few years later. The independent Seti Institute, established in 1984, took over the job. In 1992 the first planet outside the solar system is confirmed, an almost certainly uninhabitable world orbiting a pulsar. In 2009 Nasa’s Kepler telescope launches and, over the next few years, finds hundreds of planets. And . just last month, the first planet of a similar size to Earth and at the . correct distance from its parent star to host water, called Kepler . 186-f, was found. It is the most likely place that has been found that could host life as we know it. And, they add, with adequate support it is likely we will find alien life in some form or another within 20 years. ‘In the last two decades, astronomers have uncovered one so-called exoplanet after another,’ Dr Seth Shostak said in his written testimony. ‘The current tally is approximately two thousand, and many more are in the offing thanks to continued analysis of data from NASA’s enormously successful Kepler space telescope. ‘Estimates are that at least 70 per cent of all stars are accompanied by planets, and since the latter can occur in systems rather than as individuals (think of our own solar system), the number of planets in the Milky Way galaxy is of order one trillion. ‘It bears mentioning that the Milky Way is only one of 150 billion galaxies visible to our telescopes - and each of these will have its own complement of planets.’ Dr Shostak goes on to state how Kepler’s primary goal has been to ascertain whether, amongst all these planets, there are habitable worlds like our own. ‘The usual metric for whether a planet is habitable or not is to ascertain whether liquid water could exist on its surface,’ he continues. ‘Most worlds will either be too cold, too hot or of a type (like Jupiter) that may have no solid surface and be swaddled in noxious gases. ‘Recent analyses of Kepler data suggest that as many as one star in five will have a habitable, Earth-size planet in orbit around it. ‘This number could be too large by perhaps a factor of two or three, but even so it implies that the Milky Way is home to 10 to 80 billion cousins of Earth. ‘There is, in other words, more than adequate cosmic real estate for extraterrestrial life, including intelligent life.’ The two astronomers cite discoveries by Nasa's Kepler telescope as imperative to their research. Most notably, the telescope has found thousands of planets and several could be habitable such as Kepler-186f (pictured). They estimate there are 10 to 80 billion 'Earth cousins' in our Milky Way alone . Using resources such as the Allen Telescope Array (pictured) Seti astronomers hope they will one day detect a signal from an intelligent extraterrestrial race, either a message that has been sent by accident or random 'noise' like what is emitted from Earth . Dr Wethimer, meanwhile, was equally optimistic and echoed Dr Shostak’s views. ‘It would be bizarre if we are alone,’ he told the committee. ‘It would be a cramped mind that didn’t wonder what other life is out there.’ They also both agreed that Earth has never been visited by aliens. ‘I don’t think that that would be something all the governments would have managed to keep a secret,’ Shostak said. ‘If they were really here I think everyone would know that.’ The hearing comes just after a new Nasa book was published that suggested our planet could have been visited by aliens before. The book is titled Archaeology, Anthropology and Interstellar Communication and was edited by Dr Douglas Vakoch, Director of Interstellar Message Composition at the Seti Institute. With . the help of other experts he tackles a number of topics including the . prospect of life on other planets and the means through which we might . send or receive a message. In . one section Dr William Edmondson from the University of . Birmingham considers the possibility that rock art on Earth is of . extraterrestrial origin. ‘We . can say little, if anything, about what these patterns signify, why . they were cut into rocks, or who created them,’ he writes. ‘For all intents and purposes, they might have been made by aliens.’","Congress has discussed the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (Seti)

"An enraged soldier barricaded herself inside a major command's headquarters and shot herself in the head Monday after throwing objects around the office as law enforcement officials tried to negotiate with her, the Army said. She died later in the day. The soldier, who has not been identified, was pronounced dead after being taken to Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center, according to a news release issued by Fort Lee, where the Monday morning shooting took place. No other injuries were reported. The heavily trafficked base went on lockdown while the soldier was barricaded on the third floor of the four-story building that houses the Army's Combined Arms Support Command. About 1,100 people were inside, but no one else was hurt, Fort Lee officials said. Fort Lee in Virginia was placed on lockdown for 20 minutes today after reports of a 'disgruntled' soldier holed up in a building . 'This situation could've been worse,' said Maj Gen Stephen R Lyons, who took over as commanding general of CASC at Fort Lee on Friday. The Army did not identify the soldier. The soldier was a sergeant 1st class who has been in the Army for 14 years and at Fort Lee for three, Lyons said. Her gun was not a service weapon, he said. 'We are sad for our soldier in arms that she faced those kinds of challenges she had to resort to those kinds of actions,' Lyons said. He said officials did not know whether she had been treated for any mental health issues and could not speculate whether drugs or alcohol might have been a factor. Lyons described the soldier as upset and enraged during the incident but said he couldn't say whether that was consistent with her personality. The daily population at Fort Lee - 25 miles south of Richmond and 130 miles from Washington - is about 34,000, with members from all branches, their families, civilians and contractors. Fort Lee's website says the installation has seen enormous growth and renovations over the past decade as a result of realignment and closures of bases across the U.S. Army officials initially labeled Monday's incident an ""active shooter"" situation. The Department of Homeland Security uses the term to describe someone actively trying to kill people, usually in populated areas, with no pattern of choosing victims. The shooting is the fourth violent act at a Virginia military installation this year. In March, a civilian truck driver shot and killed a sailor aboard a Navy destroyer at Naval Station Norfolk before he was shot and killed by Navy security. In June, authorities said a sailor repeatedly stabbed another near Naval Medical Center Portsmouth. The same installation was placed on lockdown in April when a sailor shot and killed himself inside a barracks there. Monday's lockdown came days after Fort Lee announced in its official newspaper that a new mass warning and emergency notification system would be activated in the coming weeks. It wasn't immediately clear whether that system was used. The system allows users to input phone numbers, email addresses or pop-up alerts on any computer that's part of the main Fort Lee network, the newspaper said. Above, an aerial view of Virginia's Fort Lee which has a daily population of 34,000.

"In the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Hillary Clinton claimed that her husband was addicted to sex because he was abused by his mother, a journalist said. The then First Lady allegedly made the claims during a 1999 interview with Lucinda Franks, but the Pulitzer prize-winner declined to use them for the article she was working on. The revelation is one of a series of sensational claims made in a series of new books being published in anticipation that Clinton will make a presidential run in 2016. Family ties: Bill Clinton with his mother Virginia and her husband Dick Kelley. Hillary allegedly claimed her mother-in-law abused Bill as a child . Power couple: Bill and Hillary Clinton, pictured in May. Remarks the former First Lady allegedly made in an interview have been included in a new book . The latest revelations have been . included in Franks' memoir, which includes remarks allegedly made by . Hillary Clinton during their interview, the Daily News has reported. In her book, Timeless: Love, Morgenthau and Me, Franks claims that Clinton blamed her mother-in-law Virginia Kelley for damaging her son. Memoir: Lucinda Franks included details about a 1999 interview with Hillary Clinton in her book . Clinton claimed that Kelley, who died in 1994, hurt her son 'in ways you wouldn't believe' and, while not giving details about the alleged abuse, claimed it had been responsible for her husband's affair. 'When a mother does what she does, it affects you forever,' Clinton allegedly told Franks, 68. The claims were not included in the article Frank was writing for a magazine called Talk. But the Daily News has seen a version of the memoir that discussed a fraught relationship between the President's mother and grandmother. Franks has said she wanted to publish the interview in its entirety at the time but didn't because of the media storm over the Lewinsky affair. In the 1999 interview, Clinton described her husband's affair as a 'sin of weakness', and said she remained devoted to him despite 'enormous pain, enormous anger' over his infidelities. She added that the affair had come at a time of upheaval for the President, who was coming to terms with the loss of his mother. Frank alluded to a difficult upbringing for the President, according to Philly.com, and quoted Clinton as saying: 'He was so young when he was scarred by abuse. There was a terrible conflict between his mother and grandmother.' Further details about Frank's interview with Clinton is included in her book, due to be released next month. In another book about the Clintons, due to be published soon, tapes of Bill’s phone sex with  Lewinsky posed a threat to national security. The tapes also allegedly resulted in a not-so-subtle attempt by the Prime Minister of Israel to try to ‘convince’ the President to secure the release of an American spying for the Israelis. Bond: Hillary and Bill Clinton in 1996. The former First Lady was interviewed by Franks just after the Monica Lewinsky affair . The book, Clinton, Inc.: The Audacious Rebuilding of a Political Machine by Weekly Standard editor Daniel Halper, has been described as 'scrupulously researched' and 'juicy'. Halper reports evidence that not only the Israelis but also the British and Russians had ‘scooped up’ the microwaves off the top of the White House and taped Clinton's phone sex conversations with Monica – and perhaps other women. That bombshell and scores of others - some amusing, some alarming - are part of hundreds of pages of allegations compiled by a team of lawyers and investigators working for Lewinsky and viewed exclusively by Halper. But Halper and Franks are not the only ones writing about the Clintons, in anticipation of Hillary making a bid for the White House. A sensational book by journalist Edward Klein examines the taut relationship between the Obamas and Clintons, claiming the tension could threaten all Democrat chances in 2016. Despite their much-vaunted public truce, Klein claims in Blood Feud that Bill Clinton despises President Obama and that Michelle refers to Hillary behind closed doors as the 'Hildebeest'. The animosity between the Democratic Party's two power couples has reached such intensity that Klein says the president is willing to renege on his promise to endorse Hillary for 2016 and has teased the Clintons with suggestions that Michelle would be a strong candidate for the Oval Office.","Pulitzer prize-winner Lucinda Franks has revealed details of 1999 interview with First Lady .

"This is the haunting sight of a 'car graveyard' nestled in a Belgian forest, where vintage motors sit rusting among the fronds. The old-fashioned vehicles are thought to have been left in the wood near the village of Chatillon by U.S. soldiers who were stationed in southern Belgium during World War II. When the war ended, military troops were sent home, but could not afford to ship the cars they had bought and hid them in the forest. Since then, other cars have been added to the cemetery, many by soldiers stationed in the area after the war. Scroll down for video . Wreckage: The shell of a car sits rusting in the speckled light shining through the trees, in what has now become a popular attraction for tourists . Piece of history: The cars were parked in the middle of a forest near Chatillon, a small and ancient village in Southern Belgium . Abandoned: Many car parts have corroded or worn away over roughly 66 years since the soldiers left . Camouflage: The vehicles now blend into their surroundings because their bodywork has rusted and is covered with moss . Natural world: The cars sit in a forest of mainly oak and beech, which supports a large amount of wildlife . Waving goodbye: The exodus of American soldiers from Chatillon took pace on March 2, 1947, with the area still in chaos . Bruised and broken: Châtillon is situated in the deep south-eastern corner of Belgium, towards the port of Antwerp . Rich tapestry: Some of the cars in the fascinating cemetery were parked there by soldiers on tours at later dates . Treasure trove: The most attractive parts that have not rusted away have been stolen as souvenirs by locals and car collectors . Recyclable: Other parts of the cars have been taken to help fix similar vintage models, which can be expensive to revamp . Crumpled: Rows of cars stand in orderly fashion between the trees in the atmospheric wood . Standing firm: Years of debris has built up around the cars and vegetation grows around them . Back to the earth: The collapsing cars seem to be becoming part of the natural environment again . The ranking officers decided to leave all army cars behind, with the hope of being able to transport them home at a later date. The motors were driven up a hill and parked in a quiet spot, hidden from the outside world. Once back in the U.S., soldiers . who wanted their cars back were told they would have to take personal responsibility for . the cost of shipping. Not a single car was retrieved. Over time, corrosion and decay have worn . down the vehicles and what little remained was stolen by locals and . car collectors, with dashboards and logos proving particularly popular for fixing similar old models. Stay tuned: It was too expensive for the US army to ship the cars over to America, but they had hoped to recover them later . Priced out: After returning home, the soldiers were told they would have to take personal responsibility for the costs of shipping their cars out - and none did . Last one left: At one point there were four car graveyards around Chatillon, and as many as 500 vehicles . Tales to tell: Chatillon was used as a base in both World Wars and for post-war operations . Neatly parked: The other graveyards in the area are thought to have contained cars roughly dumped together by soldiers in the 1950s and 1960s . Heroes: American troops drive through a Belgian town in 1944 after defending them from a German offensive . At one point there were four car graveyards around Chatillon, and as many as 500 vehicles, but only one 'plot' - Part XL - remains today. It contains around 100-150 vehicles, and some of the oldest models, although it has been added to by soldiers stationed in the village in later years. The latest other cemetery on record sounds very different - it was relatively small and linked to several back gardens, with the cars dumped roughly together. The smashed motors were all from the sixties to the eighties, manufactured in Europe and the U.S. Another contained cars made only in the fifties and sixties, left there by soldiers at a nearby U.S. Army base, perhaps following post war assignments. Chatillon is one of the oldest villages in Belgium - and it is hoped that the beautiful car graveyard will be preserved for just as much time to come. Blowing the doors off: The cars, which would have been used to run errands and transport soldiers from place to place, have been ravaged by time rather than guns . Old-timers: There are other car graveyards all around the world, from Switzerland to Montana to an underwater cemetery in Legrena, Greece . Streaked with tears: The cars act almost as a memorial for what took place in Belgium and across Europe . New and old: Cars kept being brought to the same graveyards by GIs after their post-war tour was over . Eerie and enchanting: The spot is hugely popular with photographers and 'Urban Explorers' Splashes of colour: The forest is famous for its exceptional beauty . Action stations: The spot could make a perfect film set - as has happened at other car graveyards . Modern history: Around 100 to 150 cars in various stages of decomposition stand in the spot . Different style: The Americans brought great change to the war after arriving in 1918 .","They had been stationed in the southern Belgium village of Chatillon .

"An expert in colour science has hit upon an intriguing idea on why Van Gogh painted as he did - and his insights could change the way we view the Master's art. It has long-been rumoured than Van Gogh was colour-blind, and this theory is often cited as to why the artist painted with such bold strokes and vibrant, occasionally quirky hues. When Japanese-based Kazunori Asada, giving a speech in Hokkaido about vision deficiencies, found himself viewing Van Gogh's work in a room illuminated to give the impression of colour-blindness, he found the pieces of art transformed into even better pieces of art. He has now converted Van Gogh's work through the lens of colour-blindness - and shared his tool so you can try the experiment with your own choice of pictures - to see if others agree that Van Gogh looks better through impaired vision. These sequences are as close a rendition as Asada has been able to re-create in a tool available to the public . Stunning: Photography from Iceland shows us a vivid landscape of red and green, as lava flows underneath the Northern Lights .

What we are used to seeing: The Starry Night, 1889, in it's original, unaltered state . Improvement? Viewed through a colour-blind lens, the textures and mood alters subtly, the outlines become less harsh, and the colours take on a different hue . Speaking of his experiences, he said: The 'Color Vision Experience Room' used illumination filtered by an . optical filter - providing a modified spectrum of light. 'In this room, the person who has normal color vision sees color the same as the person . who has protan or deutan color vision. These types of color deficiency . mean that certain color combinations are difficult to differentiate. 'There were prints of Vincent van Gogh’s paintings in the room. Under the . filtered light, I found that these paintings looked different from the . van Gogh which I had always seen. Van Gogh, 1853 -1890, is one of the most famous artists to have ever lived. However he never achieved fame in his lifetime, leaving areas of his life a mystery to us. It . has been suggested, due to Van Gogh's use of colours and occasional . drawing of halos around lights, that he suffered wither colour-blindness . or a form of intermittent closed angle glaucoma. The . painter regularly drew coloured halos around light , especially in . images painted at night, which occurs with this condition. His . heavy use of yellows in many painting implies this colour was either a . favourite of his - or that he had a colour-blindness that made him use . yellow intensely to create his perfect images. He added: 'I love van Gogh’s paintings and have . been fortunate to view a number of the originals in various art museums. This painter has a somewhat strange way to use color. 'Although the use . of color is rich, lines of different colors run concurrently, or a point . of different color suddenly appears. I’ve heard it conjectured that van . Gogh had color vision deficiency. 'However, in the van Gogh images seen in the color vision experience . room, to me the incongruity of color and roughness of line had quietly . disappeared. 'And each picture had changed into one of brilliance with . very delicate lines and shades. This was truly wonderful experience.'

The original Cafe Terrace at Night appears here, with the tweaked version below . ... The colourblind version: Using filters washes out some of the green of the images, perhaps showing the picture as Van Gogh intended . People with normal colour vision can see the full spectrum - blue, green and red light. This is called 'trichromacy'. The photo-receptor cells within the eyes (the 'cones') do the translation work for us, but some people are missing one cone. Protanopia, the most common, is lacking red receptors, and is the type emulated in these Van Gogh images. The others are deuteranopia  - a lack of green receptors - and tritanopia, which is the lack of blue receptors. He continued: 'One of my friends who has protanomal color . vision, a designer and painter, said this to me: . ''Isn’t it wonderful? We color deficient people have understood Gogh’s . true wonderfulness and we have said that he is the genius of geniuses. 'But color normal people do not understand it well, seemingly. 'Gogh was . surely color vision deficiency. 'Therefore, color deficient people can . better understand his pictures.' Asada has created the 'Chromatic Vision Simulator' tool, available on PC, iPhone and Android, which allows normal-sighted people to see images through the eyes of those with one of the three usual colour deficiencies. Users can upload any image and play with the different filters to see how an approximation of how it looks to someone with colour-blindness.

"Five employees of the Blue Rhino propane gas plant in Florida that violently exploded last night . are fighting for their lives in critical condition today as . investigators examine whether a simple spark from a forklift at the site . could have caused the terrifying blast. Eight . people were injured in the explosion in Tavares in Lake County, . Florida, about 11pm on Monday, though miraculously no one was killed. The explosions forced the evacuation of all residents within a mile radius of the plant - as firefighters feared the three massive bulk tanks at the site, each with 30,000 pounds of the gas, would detonate. Authorities say the plant had 53,000 small 20-pound propane tanks on site when the blast ripped through the facility. Dozens of the tanks were sent high into the air as the gave inside them ignited. Photos of the aftermath show the ground littered with charred propane tanks. Scroll down for video . Blast: The explosion at the propane gas plant sent smoke and flames high into the air Monday night and early Tuesday . Thousands of detonated propane tanks litter the grounds of the Blue Rhino gas plant following a fire that caused thousands of bounds of the gas to explode . Wreckage: Thousands of propane cylinders fueled the blast and resulted countless small explosions as fire tore through the plant . Workers at the plant refilled and refurbished the propane tanks for resale for use in gas grills, RV campers and turkey friers. Firefighters have said they do not yet know what caused the late-night explosion, though they say a preliminary investigation indicates a combination of human error and equipment malfunction. A fire department source told WFTV that investigators are examining whether a spark from a passing forklift on site set off propane cause that another worker was releasing - setting off the entire explosion. For nearly an hour, firefighters were forced to stand back and watch as the propane tanks exploded, one after another after another. 'In my 36 years in the fire service, I've never seen anything like this,' Tavares Fire Chief Richard Keith said. Neighbors up to ten miles away from the plant reported seeing, hearing and feeling the explosion . Firefighters say they are thankful that the plant's three large tanks - which hold 30,000 pounds of propane each - did not ignite .

'All Blue Rhino employees who were there tonight have been accounted for. They left and got out of harms way and ended up in a few different locations,' Lake County . spokesman John Herrell said just after 2 a.m. He added that they were able to get out because they were in the main part of the building, which wasn't on fire. At an earlier press conference Herrell described the terrifying blasts as 'really surprising,' adding 'it's very, very dramatic and surreal.' Herrell said no neighboring residents were injured. A source told the Sentinel that someone may have been filling a propane tank with a leak . and a spark ignited. But Herrell said it wasn't clear what started the blaze and that the cause was being investigated. The first blasts happened inside the plant and blew the roof off, Lake County Sheriff Gary Borders said. Plant: The Blue Rhino gas plant, pictured, continued to burn into Tuesday morning .

"The mob converging on a church on the outskirts of Cairo were armed only with sticks and stones. But their frenzied attack on a lone, elderly Coptic priest was merciless.  Father Matthew Awad had refused to reveal the whereabouts of a Muslim woman who had converted to Christianity. For this offence, he was assaulted, suffered death threats and barely escaped with his life. Today, he is in hiding. His entire family fear for their safety. Matthew’s son, shop owner Marco Awad, cannot set foot in public after he was arrested and tortured by Egyptian police officers sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood. Two of his three young children are with him in a safe house while his sister, wife and four month-old-son have fled Egypt to Britain and are now staying in Brighton. Marco, who refused to be photographed because of the risk to his life, told The Mail on Sunday from a monastery in the desert: ‘Muslim fundamentalists are killing our priests, kidnapping our women and burning our churches. Since the 2011 revolution, Coptics like me have lived in fear of our lives. I’m being forced to live apart from my family because of my faith.’ Supporters of deposed President Mohammed Morsi demonstrate in Cairo on Friday . The minority Christian group are reeling after a frightening rise in religiously-motivated attacks. Last Thursday, the decapitated body of church elder Magdy Lamay Habib, 59, was found in a graveyard, six days after he was kidnapped by extremists in northern Sanai. And priest Father Mina Aboud Sharobeel, 39, was shot dead when Islamic gunmen opened fire as he drove home from a weekly grocery shop at a market in the town of El Arish, near the Gaza border. Supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood are believed to have launched the attacks because they blame Coptic Orthodox Patriarch Tawadros II for backing the military’s removal of President Mohammed Morsi from power on July 3. Christians are especially vulnerable in Sinai, where much of the population is armed and the local economy hinges on the smuggling of weapons, drugs and people. Security officials believe a local branch of Jabhat al-Nusra, the feared Islamist group that is fighting against the Syrian government, may also be operating in Sinai. As are Jihadist groups, including affiliates of Al Qaeda. Christians saw discrimination against them escalate during Morsi’s drive for an Islamic state. Around 200,000 are said to have left for new lives in Europe, America and Canada over the past year. Father Youssef Souby Zaky, a friend of the slain priest, reluctantly left his church in Rafa, northern Sinai, after it was ransacked and torched. He says: ‘Every Christian family abandoned the town because it was unsafe for us to live there. Rania Awad (left) and her baby son fled to Britain for safety after her husband was persecuted for his faith, while Father Youssef Souby Zaky (right) left his church in northern Sinai after it was ransacked and torched . ‘Several churches were vandalised and set alight, threats made against our families and four priests were kidnapped in the region – three were released after ransoms were paid, but sadly one was slaughtered. ‘These hate crimes have been fuelled by extremists trying to drive us out of Sinai, perhaps even out of Egypt. My fear is that long-term enmity will be established and our national unity will crumble to dust.’ The Awad family became targets after the family of a Muslim woman objected to her conversion to Christianity last July. ‘Extremists led the attack against my father but he managed to escape,’ Marco says. ‘They threatened to kill my sister Feeby and we were forced to flee our homes.’ He took his wife Rania and their . children – son David, ten, and daughter Karma, aged six – to live with . the in-laws. ‘Then, four months ago, I was taken from my shop by two . policemen, who said my business permit was not in order. ‘These hate crimes have been fuelled by . extremists trying to drive us out of Sinai, perhaps even out of Egypt. My fear is that long-term enmity will be established and our national . unity will crumble to dust.’ - Father Youssef Souby Zaky . ‘I was locked in a cell and beaten every day. They kept asking where my father and sister had gone. But my wife had been looking for me and she contacted the Egyptian Federation for Human Rights, who spoke to the right people and I was eventually freed. I was taken unconscious in a car and dumped in the middle of the countryside.’ Dr Naguib Gobraiel, head of the Human Rights Federation and also a Christian, describes what’s happening as ethnic cleansing. ‘It’s a pogrom,’ he claims. ‘I have three sons in their late 20s and they all emigrated with their families since Morsi took power. I’ve been threatened with death and my office burned three times.’ The former judge saw a big increase in false allegations made against Christians, especially teachers, after the Brotherhood were voted into power in the country’s first democratic elections a year ago. Criminalising blasphemy was enshrined in a controversial Islamist-backed constitution passed by Mr Morsi soon after he became president. Liberal Muslim writers and activists have since been accused of insulting Islam. But it is the country’s minority Christians – about ten per cent of the population – who bear the brunt of prosecutions and imprisonment for blasphemy. Dr Gobraiel represented 18 of them. ‘Seventeen received three to six years in prison,’ he says. ‘They went to appeals courts, hoping for retrials or lighter sentences. But the system is biased.’ His most notorious case involved Dimyana Abdel-Nour, a woman teacher in the southern tourist city of Luxor. The shy 24-year old was arrested and charged with insulting Islam during her classes, after three parents claimed she had expressed disgust for the religion to their ten-year-old daughters. She spent a week in jail before being bailed for £2,000 in May and is now hiding in a church outside the city. ‘She is in a very bad way and is being protected by one of our priests,’ says Dr Gobraiel. Supporters of ousted president Mohamed Morsi demonstrate in the street in Cairo after the evening Friday prayer on the third day of Ramadan . There has been unrest throughout Egypt as pro-Morsi supporters clashed with his opponents . ‘The charges are spurious, yet she was arrested and kept in custody. It was a very shocking experience and her father says she suffered a nervous breakdown.’ Meanwhile, a tense stand-off between pro-Morsi supporters and the military continues in the holy month of Ramadan – fasting has dampened any appetite for fighting. Television producer Maha Reda believes the Brotherhood hierarchy know they have lost the battle to hold on to power – but also claims that Egypt is not ready to be a functioning democracy: ‘The army is the only solid institution that can hold our society together and stop us drifting into more chaos.’ Marco Awad hopes that is the case – but is too afraid to take a chance with his family’s safety. ‘I never thought of leaving my country but I don’t feel safe here any more,’ he says. ‘I want my children to live somewhere where being a Christian does not put a target on their backs.’","Mail on Sunday correspondent in Cairo reveals hate acts against Christians .

"The aliens are coming and they've found the perfect landing pad, nestled among the emerald hills of an Irish suburb. That is, if you choose to believe footage made by one UFO spotter who filmed the glowing sky-balls hovering over Cork, in southern Ireland. But rather than share his discovery with the world straight away, the bashful space twitcher chose to sit on it for four months before posting a video on YouTube. Scroll down for video.

"Unveiled: The Navy SEAL is set to reveal his identity in a televised interview next week - drawing the wrath of his superiors (file photo) The commander of the Navy SEALs has lashed out at the 'selfish' serviceman planning to give a tell-all interview on national television describing how he killed Osama bin Laden. Rear Admiral Brian Losey said that seeking 'public notoriety and financial gain' from sharing secret operations is a betrayal of Navy SEAL values, and warns that the military will take legal action against anybody who breaks the law by leaking information. It comes ahead of an interview to be broadcast by Fox News, in which the as-yet unnamed Navy SEAL will reveal his identity. The program, due to air November 11 and 12, also promises an 'extensive, firsthand account' of Operation Neptune Spear, the raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, which killed the terrorist leader. Rear Admiral Losey made the attack in an open letter, co-signed by the Force Master Chief Michael Magaraci. The letter was reporting by special forces news site SOFREP, which also named the SEAL. It is unclear whether the name is correct. Although the message was not aimed at an individual, and was addressed simply to 'Teammates', it was a clear warning to the solider - also referred to as The Shooter. In the letter, Losey emphasizes that military operations - like Neptune Spear - are accomplished thanks to thousands of servicemen, and that 'little credit' is due to any individual. Elsewhere, doubt has been cast on whether anyone can claim to have personally killed bin Laden, because the operation was so dark and chaotic that no SEAL would have been able to tell whether his shot had connected rather than anyone else's. Scroll down for video . Target: 9/11 mastermind Osama Bin Laden was shot dead at his compound in May 2011. The identity of the SEAL that shot him has been a fiercely guarded since . Operation: This is the plan for Operation Neptune Spear, in which bin Laden's compound was raided and the terrorist was killed . Remote: Pictured above is bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. It has since been demolished . Losey wrote: 'A critical tenant of our Ethos is ""I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions."" Our Ethos is a life-long commitment and obligation, both in and out of the Service. 'Violators of our Ethos are neither Temmates in good standing, not Teammates who represent Naval Special Warfare. Relic: The above shirt was worn by The Shooter during the raid, and now belongs to the 9/11 museum . 'We do not abide willful or selfish disregard for our core values in return for public notoriety and financial gain, which only diminishes otherwise honorable service, courage and sacrifice. 'Our credibility as a premier fighting force is forged in this sacrifice and has been accomplished with honor, as well as humility.' He finished by urging SEALs to 'continue to serve with honor on and off the battlefield' - a clear barb for The Shooter ahead of his plans to speak. The letter follows a similar warning from the Pentagon last week, when a spokesman warned that everyone involved in the raid is bound by a non-disclosure agreement. She told Business Insider: 'If in fact this individual was associated with the military unit that carried out the UBL [Usama bin Laden] raid, which is yet to be determined, he is still bound by his non-disclosure agreement to not discuss classified information, especially in a nationally televised interview.' The Shooter has already spoken out - anonymously - about his apparent role in the operation, in an extensive account of the night for Esquire magazine. In the interview he described the fatal moment, saying: ''I'm just looking at him from right here [he moves his hand out from his face about ten inches]. He's got a gun on a shelf right there, the short AK he's famous for. 'And he's moving forward. I don't know if she's got a vest and she's being pushed to martyr them both. He's got a gun within reach. He's a threat. I need to get a head shot so he won't have a chance to clack himself off [blow himself up]. 'In that second, I shot him, two times in the forehead. Bap! Bap! The second time as he's going down. He crumpled onto the floor in front of his bed and I hit him again, Bap! Same place. Bated breath: President Obama, Hilary Clinton and Joe Biden, among others, are pictured above watching Operation Neptune Spear from Washington, D.C. as it unfolded . 'That time I used my EOTech red-dot holo sight. He was dead. Not moving. His tongue was out. I watched him take his last breaths, just a reflex breath. 'And I remember as I watched him breathe out the last part of air, I thought: Is this the best thing I've ever done, or the worst thing I've ever done? This is real and that's him. Holy sh**.' The Shooter is the second SEAL to divulge details of the night, following Matthew Bissonnette, the author of the 2012 book No Easy Day, controversially published without approval from the Department of Defense. Teammates, . Each day, thousands of current and former members of Naval Special Warfare live as 'quiet professionals'. Our members continue to serve around the world, accomplishing critical and senstivie missions that contribute to our national security, and keep our nation safe. We serve alongside many dedicated Patriots from across the military and all departments and agencies of our government. And, we serve alongside partners from many other nations who share an unwavering common commitment to long term security, stability and prosperity in the world. Any real credit to be rendered is about the incredible focus, commitment, and teamwork of this diverse network and the years of hard work undertaken with little individual public credit. It is the nature of our profession. At Naval Special Warfare's core is the SEAL Ethos. A critical tenant of our Ethos is 'I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions.' Our Ethos is a life-long commitment and obligation, both in and out of the Service. Violators of our Ethos are neither Temmates in good standing, not Teammates who represent Naval Special Warfare. We do not abide willful or selfish disregard for our core values in return for public notoriety and financial gain, which only diminishes otherwise honorable service, courage and sacrifice. Our credibility as a premier fighting force is forged in this sacrifice and has been accomplished with honor, as well as humility. The most important credit we can garner is the respect of our Temmates and Partners. Classified information is protected by law. All members exposed to classified information have a duty obligation to protect this information, regardless of what may be reflected in the media, accurate or otherwise.

"Texas Senator Ted Cruz says this month's partial government shutdown and his key role in it were a success: They got people talking. 'One of the things we accomplished in the fight over Obamacare is we elevated the national debate over what a disaster, what a train wreck, how much Obamacare is hurting millions of Americans across this country,' Cruz told about 600 Iowa Republicans on Friday at the Iowa GOP's annual fundraising dinner in Des Moines. Cruz's crusader's spirit was the perfect example of what longtime Republicans in Iowa and nationally say is at the root of the party's losing ways and has sparked an intraparty fight over the way forward after losing consecutive presidential elections. Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas spoke on Friday, October 25 during the Republican Party of Iowa's Reagan Dinner in Des Moines, Iowa. Cruz said that the partial government shutdown he played a role in was a success because it got people talking about Obamacare . It's a conversation that's spilling out from backstage to behind the podium between national GOP establishment luminaries and state leaders around the country. Although he ultimately lost, the 42-year-old freshman senator played a leading role bringing about the 16-day partial federal shutdown with his demand that President Barack Obama gut his 3-year-old health care law. He also successfully urged a core of House Republicans to follow him. The final and perhaps most important stop of Ted Cruz's recent public tour was less an exclamation point on a series of raucous events in Texas and more a presentation of opposite ideas for the GOP's way forward nationally. President Barack Obama stands with supporters of his health care law last week in the White House Rose Garden. The President was addressing problems in the rollout of his health care overhaul. For nearly five years, Republicans have struggled to make a scandal stick to the White House but Senator Ted Cruz believes Obamacare remains a problem . Immediately before the Cruz spoke, five-term Iowa Governor Terry Branstad barely acknowledged the guest and said the way forward for the party nationally was by way of the route cleared by Republican governors. Branstad, 66, at the heart of Iowa's GOP establishment, called Cruz 'a bright, up-and-coming senator' before turning his attention to the tangible successes of Republican governors, beginning with Cruz's own governor, Rick Perry of Texas. 'The results of conservative governors are making a difference,' said Branstad, who is preparing to seek election next year. Senator Cruz stands in front of pheasants that were shot during a hunt hosted by fellow Iowa GOP senator Steve King on Saturday, October 26. The Texas senator attended the Iowa GOP's annual fundraising dinner in Des Moines, Iowa, on Friday . The Texas senator shoots at a pheasant during a hunt in Iowa on Saturday. Cruz, with one eye targeting the 2016 Presidential race, has not said whether he will take aim again at Obamacare . Cruz has received a lot of attention for trying to hunt down Obamacare but his tactics have failed to show a tangible result. Cruz, pictured hunting pheasants in Iowa, claims the government shutdown he helped engineer was a success because it got people discussing the Affordable Care Act . Branstad pointed to Wisconsin and Michigan governors moves to trim union rights as reasons for falling unemployment, and Texas' reduction in regulation for rising job growth. Cruz, in his 40-minute speech, argued the health care law enacted in 2010 was the main impediment to economic growth but was vague after addressing the audience about whether he would continue to try to defund the law in the future. Cruz talked to supporters on Friday after speaking at a Republican Party dinner in Des Moines, Iowa. With an eye on the 2016 Republican Presidential nomination, Cruz told the GOP crowd the partial government shutdown he led was a 'success' 'There will be plenty of time the coming months to talk about specific tactics and strategies,' he told reporters later. 'What I think is critical is we keep the focus on Obamacare, we keep the focus on the fact that this bill isn't working.' Cruz said Democratic senators asking Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebielius for an extension of the enrollment period was no surprise. But he wished they had called for its repeal or defunding, not 'expand the enrollment period.'Former Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour pointedly accused tea party-fueled refusal to support spending measures during the shutdown foolhardy. Though Branstad wasn't as direct, he has shown little patience for Congress over the past month, especially the drama surrounding Cruz, and has called for broadening the party to make it more welcoming to voters who have turned away from the GOP. It was Cruz's third visit to Iowa, which is expected to hold the leadoff GOP nominating caucuses ahead of the 2016 presidential election.

"A police officer allegedly punched a rape victim in the face as she cowered naked in a closet at her boyfriend's home. Rebecca Gibson, who has chosen to reveal her identity even though she is the victim of an alleged sex attack, says she was raped by two strangers who offered her a ride while she was walking near her apartment in San Antonio, Texas. When she refused they attacked her, she claims. Excessive force? A police officer punched an alleged rape victim in the face as she cowered naked in a closet at her boyfriend's home . Victim: Rebecca Gibson says she was raped by two strangers who offered her a ride while she was walking near her apartment . 'Two men in a truck pulled up beside of me and asked if I needed a ride (and) I told them no,' Gibson told KSAT 12 News. 'I told them no again and one of them hit me in the back of the head and I woke up at four in the morning with no clothes, no money, no phone.' The 29-year old mother said she woke up in a laundry a half-mile away from her apartment. After getting clothes from her apartment she went to her boyfriend's home, but quickly got into an argument. 'He just completely flipped out,' she said. He was apparently angry because she had been out all night without phoning him, and called police reporting that she had broken into his home. When police arrived she was naked and hiding in a wardrobe, but refused to leave without a female officer present. The male officers forcibly removed her, punching her in the face with such force it fractured her right orbital, she says. The alleged sex attack victim was cuffed and taken to the emergency room where she had a rape examination. Medical staff also treated her facial injuries. Hospitalised: The male officers forcibly removed Miss Gibson, punching her in the face with such force it fractured her right orbital . Injured: University Hospital, San Antonio where Miss Gibson was treated for her facial injuries . At the hospital the officer was boasting about hitting Gibson, a nurse wrote in a report seen by KSAT 12 News. The report said, 'the officer was talking about it in a proud manner that he hit her.' Gibson has now hired an attorney to pursue the complaint. Augustin Arredondo Junior said: 'The aggressiveness and hostility toward this victim, it doesn't seem appropriate when dealing with sexual assault victims.' The San Antonio Police Department are investigating. In a statement to the TV station, Public Information Officer Lt. Chris Benavides wrote: 'The preliminary investigation reveals an officer responded to the location for an individual refusing to leave. 'This individual appeared to be intoxicated and aggressive. After a brief struggle with police, she was subdued. During that struggle she was struck in the face. We take all allegations seriously and investigate them thoroughly.' Miss Gibson denied she was drunk and said she was not combative with police. Watch the video .","Rebecca Gibson claimed she was attacked by men who offered her a ride .

"An attempt to ban US bosses from asking employees to hand over their Facebook login details has been blocked by Congress. A last minute alteration to the controversial Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA) that would have prevented employers demanding that prospective employees disclose social media passwords as a condition of employment was voted down in the house of representatives. The proposal, put forward by Democrat Ed Perlmutter was defeated by a 224-189 majority, according to the Huffington Post. Invasion of privacy? An amendment to a new US bill on cyber attacks aimed at preventing employers asking prospective employees for their Facebook login has been rejected . Checking up: CISPA does nothing to address concerns that US employers can legitimately ask employees for social media login details as a condition of employment (file picture) Handing over passwords could legally be a condition of acquiring or keeping a job, said WebProNews. Perlmutter said of his amendment before it was defeated: 'It helps the individual protect his right to privacy and it doesn't allow the employer to impersonate that particular employee when other people are interacting with that person across social media platforms. He warned of an invasion of privacy and the potential of employers to 'impersonate' employees online. The Democrat initially proposed the password privacy measure as part of the Federal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2012 and warned that social media users have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Blocked: The amendment to CISPA was put forward by Democrat Ed Permutter who says that social media users have an expectation of privacy . In a statement he added: 'They have an expectation that their right to free speech and religion will be respected when they use social media outlets. 'No American should have to provide their confidential personal passwords as a condition of employment.' Perlmutter faced criticism from bill sponsor Mike Rogers who claimed that he was trying to kill the act. He said that the issue should be addressed in separate legislation. But previous attempts to counteract the increasing trend of employers asking for prospective employees social networking login details have failed. The Password Protection Act 2012 was introduced to Senators and Congressman but was not passed. The overall act would allow the US Government and private companies such as Facebook to share information with one another should they come under cyber attack. But critics of the contentious bill, which initially failed when it was rejected by Senators last year, say that it would bypass privacy laws and allow companies to hand over users' information to the Government. They claim that it would prevent companies who hand over people's personal details from facing legal action and effectively justify social media spying. But CISPA recieved support from both Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives. Reassurance: Facebook told its US users earlier this month that it has no intention of sharing sensitive personal information . Although the Act was ratified by the House of Representatives, there is a good chance that it could yet fall through. CISPA was also approved by Congress in April 2012, but was rejected by the Senate. The White House even threatened to veto the act at the time. Republicans Mike Rogers and Dutch Ruppersberger have once again put CISPA forward as they say that it is vital that companies have the ability to stop threats materialising in light of an increase in the number of foreign cyber attacks from countries like China. Facebook initially came out in support of CISPA, but its name has since disappeared from a list of firms fully supporting the bill this time around. Under threat: CISPA is aimed at allowing companies to share information to thwart potential cyber attacks . And the social networking site vice president of US Public Policy Joel Kaplan reassured users that Facebook has no intention of sharing sensitive personal information with the Government. He said: 'The overriding goal of any cybersecurity bill should be to protect the security of networks and private data, and we take any concerns about how legislation might negatively impact Internet users’ privacy seriously.' But other big name companies including IBM, Intel, McAfee and Time Warner Cable are in favour of CISPA.","A last minute alteration to CISPA was defeated in a Congress vote .

"The soldiers often call Dr. Adam Tattelbaum, a plastic surgeon, in a panic. They need liposuction, and fast. A number of military personnel are turning to the surgical procedure to remove excess fat from around the waist so they can pass the Pentagon's body fat test, which can determine their future prospects in the military. Powering on: This overweight service member who failed the fitness test struggles to complete sit ups . Tough: A group of sailors and Marines who failed the so-called 'tape test' are led by an instructor on a three mile run as they work to improve their fitness and remain in the military at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego . 'They come in panicked about being kicked out or getting a demerit that will hurt their chances at a promotion,' said the Rockville, Md., surgeon. Some service members say they have no other choice because the Defense Department's method of estimating body fat is weeding out not just flabby physiques but bulkier, muscular builds. Fitness experts and doctors agree, and are calling for the military's fitness standards to be revamped, including the weight tables the Pentagon uses. They say the tables are outdated and do not reflect that Americans are bigger, though not necessarily less healthy. Work it: A U.S. Marine who failed the so-called 'tape test' works up a sweat lifting a 30-pound ammunition case during a workout to improve his conditioning . Defense officials say only a small fraction of those who exceed body fat limits perform well on physical fitness tests. 'Those incidences are far and few between,' said Bill Moore, director of the Navy's Physical Readiness Program. 'We want everybody to succeed. This isn't an organization that trains them and says, 'Hey, get the heck out'.' The checks are designed to ensure troops are ready for the rigors of combat. Pentagon officials say the military does not condone surgically altering one's body to pass the test, though liposuction is not banned. The Defense Department uses what is called a 'tape test' to make a body fat estimate by taking measurements of the waist and neck. Those who fail are ordered to spend months in a vigorous exercise and nutrition program, which Marines call the 'pork chop platoon' or 'doughnut brigade'. Even if they later pass, failing the test once can halt promotions for years, service members say. Work for it: Service members are put through their paces at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego so they're not kicked out of the military . Failing three times can be grounds for getting kicked out, military officials say. The number of Army soldiers booted for being overweight has jumped tenfold in the past five years from 168 in 2008 to 1,815. In the Marine Corps, the figure nearly doubled from 102 in 2010 to 186 in 2011 but dropped to 132 last year. The Air Force and the Navy said they do not track discharges tied to the tape test. Still, service members say they are under intense scrutiny as the military trims its ranks amid budget cuts and as the Afghanistan war winds down. Dr. Michael Pasquale of Aloha Plastic Surgery in Honolulu said his military clientele has jumped by more than 30 percent since 2011, with about a half-dozen service members coming in every month. 'Some see this as unethical but I say, 'What? It's liposuction, for God's sake',' the former soldier said. 'They have to worry about their careers. With the military downsizing, it's putting more pressure on these guys.' Staying fit: U.S. Marine Cpl. Ryan Foster talks about his training program where he helps overweight service members who have failed the 'tape test' improve their conditioning . Some go on crash diets or use weights to beef up their necks so they're in proportion with a larger waist. Pasquale said liposuction works for those with the wrong genetics. 'I've actually had commanders recommend it to their troops,' Pasquale said. 'They'll deny that if you ask them. But they know some people are in really good shape and unfortunately are just built wrong.' Fitness expert Jordan Moon said there is no reliable, economical way to measure body fat, and troops should be judged more by physical performance so they're not feeling forced to go to such lengths to save their careers. 'We're sending people away who could be amazing soldiers just because of two pieces of tape,' said Moon, who has a doctorate in exercise physiology and has studied the accuracy of body fat measurements. 'Ninety percent of athletes who play in the NFL are going to fail the tape test because it's made for a normal population, not big guys,' he added. Marine Staff Sgt. Leonard Langston, 47, said he can only blame himself for weighing four pounds over his maximum weight of 174 pounds for his 5-foot-7 frame. 'I think we've gotten away with keeping ourselves accountable. Especially the older Marines have let things go,' he said after sweating through 75 crunches with others ordered to the exercise program. 'And unfortunately, I'm an example of that.' Big guns: Desperate not to get kicked out of the military, this U.S. Marine works up a sweat lifting a 30 pound ammunition case . Studies have shown a correlation between waist size, body fat and physical endurance, military officials say, and the tape test is the best, most cost-effective tool available, with a margin of error of less than 1 percent. Air Force Gen. Mark Walsh noted only about 348 of 1.3 million airmen have failed the tape test but excelled otherwise. Even so, his branch heeded the complaints and modified its fitness program in October. The Air Force obtained a waiver from the Pentagon so airmen who fail the tape test but pass physical fitness exams can be measured using the Body Mass Index, which is a chart based on an individual's weight and height. Marine Staff Sgt. Jeffrey Smith applauded the move. Smith said he has won five Navy achievement medals but has not been promoted since failing the tape test once in 2009. 'They call you names like 'fat bodies',' Smith said. 'They talk a lot of trash to you and put you down quite often.' He launched an online White House petition this summer to talk to leaders about the tape test. The 1,700 signatures fell short of the 100,000 needed to get a response, but Smith said the Air Force gives him hope other branches might also heed the complaints. 'There's got to be something better for Marines who are working hard but just born like a tree stump,' Smith said.","Military personnel are getting liposuction to pass the Pentagon's body fat test .

"A gardener who cheated death after a pickaxe hit him in the middle of the forehead took a bus to hospital after he was told an ambulance was not necessary. Sheldon Mpofu, 37, was turning soil in his garden when he swung the pickaxe down, catching it on a washing line which then caused it to recoil and hit him in his head. The pointed end of the tool entered his skull, but it remarkably missed his brain and entered a sinus cavity. Lucky escape: Sheldon Mpofu (left) cheated death after a pickaxe hit him in the middle of the forehead while he was working in his garden. X-rays (right) revealed just how far the tool had entered his skull . With blood pouring from the wound, Mr Mpofu contacted the non-emergency NHS 111 number and was told an ambulance was not necessary but he should go to hospital within an hour. So he bandaged up the wound and took a bus to St James's Hospital, in Leeds, where doctors were stunned the pickaxe had not killed him. Medics had not immediately realised how serious the injury was, but an X-ray and CT scan revealed just how far the pickaxe had entered. Mr Mpofu, of Morley, West Yorkshire, said: 'They said there are sinuses in the forehead which are essentially empty spaces. It was just a few millimetres from entering my brain. 'How it didn’t go through was amazing. They told me I was a celebrity round the hospital. 'The doctor said ""do you realise how lucky you are?"". Everyone was telling me I’d been so lucky.' Injury: Medics had not immediately realised how serious the injury (pictured) was, but an X-ray and CT scan revealed just how far the pickaxe had entered his skull . The accident happened last month as Mr Mpofu was preparing his garden to lay some turf. Mr Mpofu had five stitches and was kept in hospital overnight. He said a number of doctors visited him after hearing about his injury. Mr Mpofu said he has been suffering headaches but the wound is healing and he has been told he does not need an operation. Emergency: Mr Mpofu took a bus to the hospital after he contacted the non-emergency NHS 111 number and was told an ambulance was not necessary . He said: 'I feel like I’ve had a second lease of life. It’s made me value life because anything can happen. I will definitely use my pickaxe again - but very carefully. 'It still amazes me. We are short of miracles. I’m a Christian and I want to let people out there know that miracles can happen.' He was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary by ambulance where specialists in the field are based.","Pickaxe hit Sheldon Mpofu in the forehead while working in his garden .

"Reese Witherspoon was arrested for disorderly conduct after allegedly resisting the orders of a police officer in Atlanta, Georgia, early on Friday morning. The actress was jailed along with husband James Toth after he failed to pass a sobriety test. The city’s Department of Corrections confirmed that the couple were arrested after Toth was stopped by a patrol car under suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. Not her best angle: Mugshots of Reese Witherspoon and her husband Jim Toth were both released on Sunday after the pair were arrested on Friday night . According to a police report released on Sunday, Reese was handcuffed and briefly jailed for refusing to obey orders given to her by an officer of the law. Her husband was also put under arrest for a blood alcohol level reported to be .139, well above the legal limit of 0.08. Reese, 37, and Toth, 42, were released on bail at 3:30 in the morning on Friday. Jailed: Reese and husband Jim, pictured here in December, were arrested by Atlanta Police, on Friday . Before their release, the couple both posed for mugshots. Reese, who is currently brunette, is pictured looking down with what appears to be a slight smirk across her face. Meanwhile, her beau looks up to the camera in his picture, appearing somewhat glassy-eyed. Their initial legal hearing for their arrests is set for Monday morning in the Atlanta Municipal court. It was initially thought Reese and Jim would be in court on Monday morning in Atlanta. However TMZ reports the couple's cases have been postponed, with Reese's set for May 22 and Jim's for May 23. Arrest report: An arrest report listing both Reese and Jim's offenses was also released on Sunday . Detailed: The documents detail how the Oscar winning actress and her beau had a run in with a Georgia State Patrol officer in the early hours of Friday April 19 . Play-by-play: It goes on to explain Reese's play-by-play reaction to her husband's arrest . The family is currently residing in Atlanta to shoot Reese’s new movie The Good Lie. Toth was apprehended after midnight on Friday for recklessly weaving across Peachtree Street in the city of Atlanta. The police report alleges that the Hollywood agent smelled of alcohol and appeared 'disheveled'. After pulling the DUI suspect over, a sobriety test was conducted in a Walgreens parking lot. Reese is said to have been warned to remain inside her vehicle, while her husband was subjected to the DUI test. Moving on: Reese and Jim were seen attending a screening of her new film Mud in New York on Sunday night just hours after their arrests . The officer on the scene claims that the actress became clearly agitated and eventually disobeyed his verbal commands. The officer reported: ‘Mrs. Witherspoon began to hang out the window and say that she did not . believe that I was a real police officer.’ The law enforcer explained in the report: ‘I told Mrs. Witherspoon to sit on her butt and be quiet.’ But . once Toth was handcuffed, the mother-of-three disembarked from her . seat, telling the officer that she was a ‘US citizen’ and that she had . the right to ‘stand on American ground’. Disorderly conduct: Reese was arrested for allegedly disregarding an officer's orders while her husband was handcuffed for failing a sobriety test, the family pictured in Tennessee with their son, in March . The report then described how Reese resisted him as he grabbed her arms to arrest her. Toth is said to have made a verbal attempt to calm his hysterical wife. The . officer’s report further details: ‘Mrs. Witherspoon asked, “Do you know . my name?” I answered, “No, I don’t need to know your name.” I then . added, “right now.” Mrs. Witherspoon stated, “You’re about to find out . who I am.”’ Tight couple: The famous pair were released on bail early Friday morning, pictured at Cannes Film Festival, in May last year . According to the arresting officer: . ‘Mrs. Witherspoon also stated, “You are going to be on national news.” I . advised Mrs. Witherspoon that was fine.’ Toth is said to be facing charges for driving under the influence and failure to stay within his lane while on the road.

"Their intricate designs and the shear impressive size of them takes meticulous planning and precision execution. And the resulting crop circle, while illegal and irritating to the farmer whose field has been targeted, is usually visually stunning. But while some crop circles are remembered for their perfect symmetry and unique patterns, others are slightly less impressive. A series of recent attempts at producing circles have been been met with much derision by fans of the field art after they recently appeared in Wiltshire. Not very impressive: This image of a heart appeared in a field of crops in Cherhill, Wiltshire . Rubbish: The heart shaped crop circle appeared in the fields below the Westbury White Horse in Wiltshire . How it should look? A slightly more impressive crop circle featuring a heart which appeared in a nearby field in Wiltshire in August 2000 . Insiders say a number of top crop circle makers have quit following a clampdown by farmers and moved onto making sand circles, which are legal. In previous years, impressive crop circles have drawn in thousands of tourists to southern England and some believers who saw the circles as the work of aliens. But this year visitors have been disappointed by just a handful of crude patterns such as a square, a heart and a small uneven circle. Former crop circlemaker Matthew Williams - who has given up his hobby because he suffers from hayfever - said the lack of competition is driving down standards. He said: 'The problem is that the . best croppies have retired or gone onto something new, so there isn't . any competition any more. 'They're all creative types, and without any friendly rivalry, many just can't be bothered. 'All . the best crop circles from the last few years have been made by only a . handful of people, and they've all hung up their wooden board now and . moved onto pastures new.' Bizarre: The prankster's attempts at a crop circle in this Devizes field did not go quite to plan, you can't really make out what the shape is supposed to be . Poor effort: This attempt at a crop circle is one of 15 to have appeared across the county so far this year . A better attempt: This stunning crop circle appeared in nearby Calne in August 2000 . Matt, 42, reckons the 15 less than impressive circles that have appeared this year were created by amateurs. In comparison, seasoned veterans had produced more than 50 by this time last year. He said: 'Julian Richardson, one of the best croppies ever, has moved on to making sand circles instead. 'He wants to try something different and I think he's fed up with believers trying to make money from his hobby - that he never made a penny for. 'I've retired due to hayfever, and a couple of my peers have just given up as well - it's becoming too difficult. 'The farmers are getting angrier, the believers are getting too demanding and we're still not making any money.' Matt hit the headlines in 2006 when he became the first person ever to be convicted of criminal damage for creating a crop circle in a field of wheat. What is it? It's anyone's guess as to what the creator of this circle was trying to depict . It's a mystery: Even a close up of the crop formation doesn't give any clues as to what it is supposed to be . More like it: Perhaps the creators of this year's formation was hoping to produce something a little like this image which appeared in Chilbolton, Wiltshire in August 2000 . He was caught after setting up a sting to debunk a Ufologist's claim that he could communicate with aliens and would get them to make a specific shape in a field. Farmers across Wiltshire and Hampshire are also fed up with crop circles and tourists looking to have a 'out of body experience' inside them. Some have taken the drastic step of mowing the formations out of their fields as soon as they appear. Dutch crop circle 'expert' Monique Klinkenbergh tried to set up a pass scheme to charge people to look at the circles and walk inside them. The £60 season ticket was intended to bring in revenue for farmers but it has flopped after it allowed access to only two formations. Gone: It is thought that the people behind crop circles such as this one which appeared at Calne in August 2000 have moved on to pastures new . Monique and two colleagues Derek Viner and Charles Mallett set up a crop circle information centre at a garden centre in Woodborough, Wiltshire . Matt added: 'Loads of the boys are quitting making them now, because it's being ruined by outsiders like Klinkenbergh who are trying to make money from our hobby. 'We in the circle making community are outraged that outsiders like Klinkenbergh would come in and take over, trying to interfere. 'Farmers are sick to their back teeth too and are cutting more circles out of their field than ever before - if it continues like this, then there won't be any circles at all next year. 'It's such a shame, because myself and a lot of people have had a great deal of fun with crop circles over the years.'","Just 15 poor attempts at crop circles have appeared in Wiltshire this year .
Last year, seasoned crop artists had already produced more than 50 .

"Pulitzer Prize finalist photo journalist Mary Calvert is revered for putting a spotlight on humanitarian issues that are ignored or that people are not aware of. While her work - centered on women and children in crisis - has taken her all over the world, from the Democratic Republic of Congo to India, her latest assignment is much closer to home. The former Washington Times photographer has compiled a photo essay that attempts to expose the widespread sexual harrassment of women in the American military that is going unreported. Calvert says that an estimated 26,000 rapes and sexual assaults took place in the armed forces last year, however only one in seven victims reported their attacks. Heartbreaking: Melissa Bania holds a banner on the foot bridge across from the entrance to Naval Station San Diego. The sexual assault victim is part of a photo essay by Mary Calvert called The Battle Within: Sexual Violence In America's Military . Coping: Virginia Messick was raped by her drill sergeant at Lackland Air Force Base during basic training. Her rapist was convicted of raping 10 women under his command and is serving a 20 year prison sentence. She holds her old uniform at home in Marysville, California . Help: Dr Nancy Lutwak, Veteran's Administration emergency room physician in New York, opened up a room just for female vets so they could have a safe place to share their experience of being raped in the military and the health problems they face because of the assaults . Comfort: Meredith Hilderman was a Korean linguist in the US Marines and a newlywed when she was raped by a fellow Marine. Her master Sergeant told her: 'You must have wanted it. You're married and your husband isn't here.' Now out of the military, she sits at her home in her Akron, Ohio . Survivor: US Army Pfc.

While Staff Sgt. Louis Corral is serving just four years in prison for assaulting her and four other female trainees, Natasha suffers daily from PTSD because of the attack . Getting by: Military rape survivors Jennifer Norris and Jessica Hinves smoke and discuss their assaults late into the night at Jessica's home. Jennifer Norris was drugged and raped by her recruiter after joining the US Air Force when she was 21 years old. Jessica Hinves, was an Air Force fighter jet mechanic when she was raped by a member of her squadron at Lackland Air Force Base . Troubled: Jennifer Norris was drugged and raped by her recruiter after joining the US Air Force when she was 21 years old. In tech school, she fought off the sexual assault of her instructor and later evaded the advances of her commanders. She suffered a campaign of retaliation from her peers after reporting the attacks and now suffers with PTSD . Only one in 10 of those reported attacks then went to trial. She was initially inspired by the case Jessica Hinves, an Air Force fighter jet mechanic who was raped by a member of her squadron. 'After a steady campaign of harassment and retaliation by her fellow servicemen, the case against her rapist was thrown out the day before the trial was to begin by a new commander who said, ''Though he didn’t act like a gentleman, there was no reason to prosecute'',' Calvert wrote on her website. Hinves was discharged from the military soon after for post-traumatic stress disorder. Calvert says that, like Hinves, most victims are forced out of the service as a result and go on to suffer the effects of Military Sexual Trauma (MST) such as depression and substance abuse. And so she set out to meet with those victims and document their stories photographically. The result is The Battle Within: Sexual Violence In America's Military, a stunning and heartbreaking look at how these women have been forced to live their lives.

"A stately home that has been owned by no less than three British monarchs since it was built nearly 1,000 years ago is for sale for nearly £5m. Horton Priory, which was built in the early 1100s, was owned by King Henry I, King Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I, among other illustrious owners. But they would be hard-pressed to recognise the Grade I-listed, 11-bedroom house now, complete as it is with cinema room, gym, heated swimming pool and four air-conditioned wine cellars. House with a history: Horton Priory was owned by Henry I, Henry VIII, and Elizabeth I during its 900-odd year history . Spread over more than 20,000sq ft, Horton Priory is the size of 21 'average-sized' three-bedroom modern homes. Quite understandably, the current owners of the stunning stately home near Ashford in Kent want to downsize, and have put it on the market with upmarket estate agents Savills with a price tag of £4.95m. Given that it's one of the UK's oldest homes, it's no surprise Horton Priory has a history to match. The Priory was owned by Henry I before being passed to the Roman Catholic Congregation of Cluny, whose monks ran it as Cluniac monastery for centuries until the 1500s. Following the dissolution of the monasteries, Henry VIII seized ownership of Horton Priory from the monks, and he later passed it on to his daughter, Queen Elizabeth, before it was given to the Mantell family in 1570. The Priory has 55 acres of land and has undergone an extensive restoration under the guidance of English Heritage. Complete with medieval fishponds, Horton Priory also boasts a more modern heated swimming pool . Will Peppitt, a director in Savills country department, said: 'There are not many houses which date back as far as the 12th century, let alone that have been owned by three monarchs. 'Its charm and value lie in the fact that it is an imposing stately home but also a beautiful family property, too. 'Horton Priory has only been on the market for a week and three people have seen it, with two already very interested. 'The people who want a home like this appreciate it as a fascinating piece of architecture. It really is in the premier league of properties.' Initially built as a Cluniac monastery , the house now boasts a stunning bespoke kitchen and four air-conditioned wine cellars . Horton Priory has fireplaces from the Tudor, Elizabethan and Edwardian eras, including this one in the panelled dining room . Whether that is a hint towards a celebrity footballer purchaser remains to be seen, but there's no doubting that despite its grandeur and history, Horton Priory has many of the toys wealthy footballers see as necessities in their homes. As well as a heated swimming pool, tennis court, croquet lawn, putting green and golf driving range, the Priory boasts four air-conditioned wine cellars with double bins, a cinema, sewing room and table-tennis room. It also has more traditional features, including a Tudor doorway leading into a vaulted area with ruins of the 12th Century church and priory buildings, and a wooden minstrels' gallery. The priory, which was home to Roman Catholic monks for centuries, has been meticulously renovated . Horton Priory has a series of interconnecting reception rooms situated off a 'long gallery' including drawing, dining and sitting rooms with fireplaces from the Tudor, Elizabethan and Edwardian eras. Outside there are sweeping lawns overlooking ancient pastures, with a ha-ha, ponds, orchard and kitchen garden with automated irrigation system. The grounds contain the site of an earlier Iron Age settlement, pre-dating the Roman conquest and now designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument Site. After the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII, the house passed from the King, via a short spell in the hands of Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, to Richard Tate.  It then passed to the Mantell family, before being owned by Elizabeth I, and then being passed back to the Mantell family who owned it for another 300 years. The house - one of only a handful of Cluniac priories still standing in Britain today - also boasts the ruins of a Norman church in its grounds.","Horton Priory in Kent was owned by three monarchs, including King Henry I .
It dates back to early 1100s and was a Cluniac monastery until the 1500s .

"The world’s population will reach almost eleven billion by the end of the century because of soaring birth rates in Africa, according to new research. The latest projection is about 800 million - eight percent - more than a previous UN forecast of 10.1 billion issued in 2011. Researchers had expected fertility on the poorest continent where a woman will give birth to an average of 5.2 children in her lifetime, to fall more quickly than it has. Soaring: The world¿s population will reach almost eleven billion by the end of the century because of soaring birth rates in Africa, according to new research . The current African population is about 1.1 billion and it is now expected to reach 4.2 billion, nearly a fourfold increase, by 2100. Professor Adrian Raftery, of the University of Washington, said: 'The fertility decline in Africa has slowed down or stalled to a larger extent than we previously predicted, and as a result the African population will go up.' A study last year found shifting population trends mean one in three children born by 2050 will be African. Increasing: The current African population is about 1.1 billion and it is now expected to reach 4.2 billion, nearly a fourfold increase, by 2100 . The new estimates are based on better statistical methods developed by Prof Raftery and colleagues using finely tuned data that anticipate the life expectancies. In other areas of the world, fewer major population changes are expected. Europe may see a small decline because of fertility continuing below replacement level, and other nations around the globe may see modest increases due to longer life expectancies, said Prof Raftery. But there is no end in sight for the increase of world population, yet the topic has gone off the agenda in favour of other pressing global issues including poverty and climate change. With famine recently returning to the Horn of Africa, it is feared a continent already feeling the pain of climate change will be unable to produce enough food or more importantly, have enough water, to meet its needs. Africa is growing fast because it is young. The top 10 youngest populations in the world are all from the continent, led by Niger with an estimated 48.9 per cent below the age of 14, Uganda and Mali. Many will have big families, knowing despite ongoing efforts to combat malnutrition and HIV, there is a strong risk many of their children will die. Prof Raftery said: 'These new findings show that we need to renew policies, such as increasing access to family planning and expanding education for girls, to address rapid population growth in Africa.' The UN gives high and low variants of its projections, assuming women have an average of half a child more or less than the best projection. That leaves a large uncertainty, from 7 billion to nearly 17 billion, in the range for potential world population. 'Our probability intervals are much tighter, ranging from 9 billion to 13 billion in 2100,' added Prof Raftery. The global population reached 7 billion in 2011, having passed 6 billion in 1999.","Projection is 800 million more than a previous UN forecast of 10.1 billion .

"The parents of a toddler with spinal bifida are outraged after TSA officials forced their daughter to undergo a series of additional security measures ahead of their flight to Disney World. Nathan and Annie Forck were flying out of their home state of Missouri on a February 8 flight bound for Orlando, Florida with their wheelchair-bound daughter Lucy and their two other children. Mrs Forck took a six-minute video detailing their toddler’s cries as she said through tears that she didn’t want to go to Disney World anymore, and is claiming the TSA discriminates against people who use mobility devices. Scroll down for video . Trail of tears: Lucy, pictured bottom, was in tears after a TSA agent subjected the three-year-old girl to a full patdown; the TSA later issued an apology . Upset: Throughout the patdown, the little girl was weeping and saying: 'i don't want to go to Disney World.' The family was flying to Orlando from their home in Missouri . As Fox News Radio reports, the Forcks were attempting to fly to Orlando to enjoy a family vacation at Disney World and were flying out of Lambert-St Louis International Airport. Though they got through the TSA security checkpoint without incident, a TSA agent pulled the family aside to screen Lucy’s wheelchair further for a pat down and swabbing her mobility device. Mrs Forck pulled out her smart phone and began recording the whole event, against the TSA agent’s request. ‘It’s illegal to do that,’ the female agent is heard saying. Mrs Forcks responds: ‘You can’t touch my daughter unless I can record it,’ and later adds: ‘The problem is, I don’t allow anyone to touch my little daughter.’ Throughout the argument between the mother and the TSA agent, Lucy can be heard crying, apparently confused at what exactly was going on. Her stuffed animal, ‘Lamby,’ had been scanned via X-ray and had not been returned to her. Know your rights: Mother Annie Forck filmed the entire patdown and said she had the right to film it, despite the TSA agent's protest . At one point Lucy's beloved stuffed animal Lamby was taken from her as well . Mr Forck, an attorney, told Fox News . that he knew it was legal to record the event and said that if the same . instance had occurred outside the setting of an airport, it would be . illegal. ‘But you put a TSA badge on and now all of a sudden, it’s okay,’ he told the station. The father added that he and his wife were not trying to make a scene, but instead were looking out for the well-being of their daughter. The TSA later admitted its agents should never have threatened to patdown the little girl and apologized to the family. 'While no pat-down was performed, we will address specific concerns with our workforce,' a spokeswoman told MailOnline. According to the TSA website, ‘passengers who can neither stand nor walk will be screened by a thorough patdown while they remain seated.’ The site adds: ‘A patdown procedure is used to resolve any alarms of a metal detector or anomalies identified by imaging technology.’ Checkpoint: The TSA states on its website that those in wheelchairs and scooters who cannot walk must go through a comprehensive patdown . The government agency offers a notification card for those with medical issues, but it is clearly stated on the card that presenting it to agents doesn’t exempt passengers from screening. Mr Forck told Fox News that Lucy had no problem coming through Orlando’s TSA checkpoint. The Transportation Security Administration was formed in early 2002 following the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.","Forck family was flying from Missouri to Orlando, Florida for vacation .

"North Dakota news anchor A.J. Clemente fired for swearing on his live TV debut continued his round of national media interviews with an appearance on the ‘The Late Show’ with David Letterman on Wednesday night. Talking about his now infamous appearance on KFYR when his first words were 'F****** S***,' Clemente told Letterman he ‘crawled in bed’ after being told that his slip had been broadcast live. ‘I went home, crawled in bed and called my parents,’ Clemente admitted. ‘But the next day, you gotta pick yourself up, you gotta laugh at yourself and keep going.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . New found fame: A.J. Clemente told Letterman that he'd jump at the chance to work at sports channel ESPN if they offered him a job after his infamous swearing outburst . Clemente admitted to Letterman that his first reaction after the swearing incident was to crawl into bed and call his parents . Clemente has proved a figure of fun for Letterman this week and on Tuesday night he had even devoted his Top 10 list to the sacked anchor's plight. Several more gags were made at Clemente’s expense on Wednesday’s show, but Letterman also offered words of encouragement during their chat and told him 'he would be just fine.' But when a cocky-sounding Clemente made it clear he was hoping his moment of madness might turn into an offer of a bigger job ideally from ESPN, Letterman told him to forget it. ‘Look, I'm trying to get you the job back in Bismarck, forget about ESPN,’ said Letterman. ‘That ain't gonna happen. You're going back to Bismarck.’ Second chance: A.J. Clemente, from Bismarck, North Dakota, also appeared on the Today Show . Getting by: Clemente did his best to laugh with the NBC anchors over the situation while still calling his gaffe inexcusable and fully expected to be fired like he was . It has been a busy couple of days for . Clemente since he inadvertently dropping an F-bomb during his first day . on the job and promptly got fired. On Wednesday morning he made appearances on both Live With Kelly and Michael and the Today show. On Live With Kelly and Michael, the show's control room bleeped Clemente even when he didn’t swear as a joke. Kelly Ripa explained it was a ‘precautionary bleep.’ Still Clemente had the last laugh as the show hired him as celebrity correspondent for a night. Cohost Michael Strahan told Clemente, ‘One thing about New Yorkers, we believe in giving second chances, man. Yesterday, we called for you. You came here today. (Applause) So, we have a challenge for you if you're willing to accept it. We're going to send you to cover the star-studded red-carpet premiere of Pierce Brosnan's new movie, Love Is All You Need.’ Said Ripa: ‘Now, should you choose to accept this mission, your job is to interview all the celebrities that you can and bring the tape back to us here tomorrow. Are you up for it? What do you think?’ Clemente agreed. ‘Yeah,’ he said, adding, ‘yeah, definitely.’ Spotlight:  AJ Clemente also appeared on LIVE with Kelly and Michael . Earlier on the Today show he revealed that at first he had no idea that his astonishing outburst had been broadcast live on air last Sunday. 'When . I first saw the clip, it was gut-wrenching,' Clemente told the Today show of those two words that first introduced him to Bismarck's evening . news audience, as well as the rest of America. 'F****** S***,' Clemente is heard just as the camera cut to him hiding his face at the anchor desk. 'I didn't even know I said it on camera until my news director walked in on the third break,' he said. His co-anchor appeared to stumble over his profanity but he says it was all a situation of the two of them being tossed to from the control room while caught off guard. He says he hadn't yet been given an ear piece by the station and his co-anchor had forgotten hers in her car. Poor introduction: Clemente made the blunder during his first presenting debut on KFYR . 'I was looking down, I was going over my script, Van my co-anchor happens to be looking at the camera and she notices the red light comes on, we actually came on 30 seconds early,' he says. Then when he saw several names he couldn't pronounce related to the London Marathon winners in his upcoming script, 'fireball shot came right out of my mouth,' he explained. 'I fully expected that they would fire me' he said while calling those two words 'inexcusable.' 'Rookie mistake. I’m a free agent. Can’t . help but laugh at myself and stay positive,' Clemente later wrote on . Twitter after first being suspended by the station and getting through what he described as a . 'tough day.' ‘I want to apologize for an incident . that occurred prior to our early newscast this evening, when one of our . employees used profanity on the air,’ Monica Hannan, KFYR-TV wrote in an apology on the station's Facebook page on Sunday. Off guard: Clemente told the Today show that he didn't have an ear piece and the control room cut to him and his co-anchor 30 seconds earlier than expected . Opportunity: Helping him out the anchors allowed Clemente to toss to a commercial break as part of his new anchor reel . ‘He . did not realize his microphone was on, but still, that's no excuse. We . train our reporters to always assume that any microphone is live at any . time. Unfortunately, that was not enough in this case. WE can't take . back what was said,' she wrote. But what Clemente and Hannan both call 'inexcusable,' may have turned into the biggest boost in his career. At the end of his interview Clemente was given the privilege by NBC’s Matt Lauer of teasing the next segments on Today while throwing to a commercial break. 'Thank God for each day,' Clemente tweeted on Wednesday. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE: .","Sacked for swearing on his TV debut, A.J. Clemente has been enjoying his brief moment of national fame .

"The 105-storey pyramid-shaped hotel that has dominated the skyline of North Korea's capital city for more than 20 years may finally be on the verge of opening for the first time. It is hoped Pyongyang's Ryugyong Hotel will partially open in the middle of next year - 26 years after construction began. It is the 47th tallest building in the world, standing at 1,100ft, and has the fifth highest number of floors. Expensive: The 105-story Ryugyong Hotel, in Pyongyang, North Korea, has been an embarrassment for the country's authoritarian regime after they ran out of money to complete it . Dominating the skyline: But the 'Hotel of Doom' may open next year after the international hotel operator Kempinski AG resumed construction in 2009 . Reto Wittwer, CEO of international hotel operator Kempinski AG, said only 150 rooms on the very top floors will be used as a hotel instead of the originally intended 3,000. The remainder of the building will contain  shops, offices, ballrooms, restaurants and 150 rooms. The enormous structure dubbed the 'Hotel of Doom' has been a source of fascination and ridicule around the world and an oversized embarrassment for North Korea's authoritarian regime led by the Korean Workers' Party. North Korea began building the Ryugyong in the 1980s but stopped when North Korea suffered an economic crisis and funding ran out in the 1990s. It was voted 'Worst Building in the History of Mankind' by Esquire magazine in 2008, which described the Ryugyong as 'hideously ugly, even by communist standards'. Changing tactics: Only 150 rooms in the very top part of the building will be used as a hotel while the rest will contain shops and offices . Tall order: The enormous Ryugyong hotel is the 47th tallest building in the world at 1,100ft and has the fifth highest number of floor . But exterior construction resumed in 2009 when Egyptian company, Orascom Telecom, took over and various reports in recent years said the hotel was preparing to finally open. Orascom Telecom launched a mobile network in North Korea in 2008 and has reportedly spent £112m completing the hotel's facade. In September, a Beijing-based tour agency was allowed to peek inside and released pictures of the bare concrete lobby. Mr Wittwer said he first saw a picture of the hotel many years ago and thought then that it could eventually make a lot of money.","Construction on the  Ryugyong Hotel in Pyongyang began in 1987 .

"Tragic: Conor MacMannis, 20, died early this morning after falling from a ninth floor balcony at the Penn Towers building on Beaver Avenue in Pennsylvania . A 20-year-old college student has died after falling from the ninth-floor balcony of a Pennsylvania apartment building, just eight months after his younger brother passed away. Conor MacMannis was reportedly alone when he tumbled from the Penn Towers complex on Beaver Avenue about 3.45am this morning. Police said drugs and alcohol were factors in the Pennsylvania State University student's fall. He died from his head injuries. The Centre County coroner this afternoon ruled the death as accidental, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. 'It's tragic,' Penn State spokeswoman Annemarie Mountz told Onward State. 'We're trying to come to grips with it ourselves. It's just so sad.' This latest tragedy comes just eight months after MacMannis' brother, 15-year-old Aiden Hall MacMannis, died - a devastating blow for parents Andrew and Kathryn MacMannis who lost two of their three sons in one year. Conor MacMannis paid tribute to Aiden on his Facebook page on the day his brother died: . 'Treasure your family. Regardless how much you may fight, argue, and say you hate each other because they aren't going to be around forever,' he wrote on March 17. 'RIP Aiden MacMannis you'll always be my little brother and I love you for that.'

Conor, a kinesiology major, was a talented member of Penn State's track and field team. At the Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference (ECAC) indoor championships in early March, he led the way for his team with a third place finish in the high jump, clearing 1.97m. His father, Andrew MacMannis, was also a Penn State University graduate. According to his Linkedin account, Andrew MacMinnis works in the Marine Air and Ground Task Force as the Pacific's maritime contingency force. He was also involved in the humanitarian assistance and disaster relief effort following Japan following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. When Aiden passed away earlier this year, the family asked that donations be made to 'Operation Purple Camp' at militaryfamily.org, or the Make-A-Wish Foundation for the Mid-Atlantic States, in lieu of flowers.

"Israel and not America was behind the hacking of millions of French phones, it was claimed today. In the latest extraordinary twist in the global eavesdropping scandal, Israeli agents are said to have intercepted more than 70 million calls and text messages a month. Up until now the French have been blaming the U.S., even summoning the country’s Paris ambassador to provide an explanation. Scroll down for video . France first suspected the U.S. of hacking into former president Nicolas Sarkozy's communications network when he was unsuccessfully trying for re-election in 2012 . But today’s Le Monde newspaper provides evidence that it was in fact Israeli agents who were listening in. France first suspected the U.S. of hacking into former president Nicolas Sarkozy’s communications network when he was unsuccessfully trying for re-election in 2012. Intelligence officials Bernard Barbier and Patrick Pailloux travelled from Paris to Washington to demand an explanation, but the Americans hinted that the Israelis were to blame. The Americans insisted they have never been behind any hacking in France, and were always keen to get on with the French, whom they viewed as some of their closest allies. They were so determined to be friends with the French, that U.S. briefing notes included details of how to pronounce the names of the Gallic officials. A note published in Le Monde shows that the Americans refused to rule out Mossad, Israel’s notoriously uncompromising intelligence agency, or the ISNU, Israel’s cyber-intelligence unit. Today's newspaper report was co-written by Glenn Greenwald, whose main contact is NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden (pictured) Tailored Access Operations (TAO), the branch of the US National Security Agency (NSA) which deals with cyber-attacks, is referred to throughout the note. It reads: ‘TAO intentionally did not . ask either Mossad or ISNU whether they were involved as France is not an . approved target for joint discussions.’ Le . Monde’s article, co-authored by U.S. journalist Glenn Greenwald, whose . main contact is NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, however, hints that . the Israelis were doing the spying. Both . US and French intelligence work closely with Mossad, but there is known . to be a great deal of suspicion between all the agencies. A . 2008 NSA note says that the Israelis are ‘excellent partners in terms . of sharing information’, but it also says that Mossad is ‘the third most . aggressive intelligence service in the world against the United . States’. A spokesman . for the Israeli government told Le Monde: ‘Israel is a country which is a . friend, ally and partner of France and does not carry out any hostile . activity which could pose a threat to its security.’ France has complained in the past about Mossad's use of its soil to plan so called black operations including the 2010 assassination in Dubai of Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh of the Palestinian movement Hamas. The revelation comes after senior . German officials said they would be travelling to the U.S. 'shortly' to . talk about allegations the NSA bugged Angela Merkel's phone. Anger: German Chancellor Angela Merkel (left) and Brazil's Dilma Rousseff (right) have both voiced concerns over the . NSA's infiltration of the online communications of foreigners . The . heads of Germany's foreign and domestic intelligence agencies will . participate in high-level discussions with the White House and National . Security Agency, government spokesman Georg Streiter said. News of the talks signals an escalation in the diplomatic tensions between the U.S. and its allies after it was claimed the NSA had monitored the calls of 35 world leaders. Brazil and Germany have joined forces in an attempt to pile pressure on the United Nations to rein in the snooping activities. They want a UN General Resolution that promotes the right to online privacy. This step, the first major international response to the NSA's infiltration of the online communications of foreigners, comes after German Chancellor Merkel said the recent U.S. espionage scandal has shattered international trust in Barack Obama. Angela Merkel said the recent espionage scandal has shattered international trust in President Obama . Not hacked: The White House has denied that David Cameron's communications were ever monitored . A month earlier Brazil's president Dilma Rousseff branded the NSA's clandestine activities 'a breach of international law' in a speech to the UN General Assembly and demanded steps be made to stop 'cyberspace from being used as a weapon of war'. Brazilian and German diplomats met in New York yesterday to thrash out a draft resolution demanding the strengthening of privacy rights in the International Covenant Civil and Political Rights. While the UN has no real power to reign in the NSA, there are fears among security experts that the effort alone could signal a growing consensus to freeze the US out of future international security dialogues.","Agents said to have intercepted 70 million calls and text messages a month .

"Stormed: Armed police raced to the home of Ian Driscoll (pictured) after he posted a new profile picture on Facebook featuring an Action Man, along with a toy mortar gun in the background . There were five police officers at the door, two of them carrying submachine guns. And they were ready to smash the door open so it was fortunate Ian Driscoll was in when they pulled up outside his home. They had come in search of a deadly mortar tube – spotted in the background of a picture that Mr Driscoll had posted on Facebook. Mr Driscoll, 43, did indeed have a mortar in the home and promptly showed it to the squad. It was a toy. After inspecting the model mortar, the rather embarrassed team of officers apologised and took their leave. ‘I couldn’t believe someone thought it was real,’ said Mr Driscoll, a model maker, at his home in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire. ‘It’s tiny and quite clearly a toy. I can’t stop laughing. I think it’s hilarious.’ The mortar, or at least part of it, was featured in a picture Mr Driscoll took of an Action Man figure and a toy Alsatian dog. He posted the picture on Facebook ‘as a laugh’ because he says he looks rather like the Action Man figure and owns an Alsatian. The mortar was near to a TV remote control which showed how small it was. Nevertheless, someone called in the police. He says that the officers did manage to ‘see the funny side’ even though their mission had ended in farce. Cause of alarm? The Facebook profile picture of Mr Driscoll showing an action man and his model mortar . Mr Driscoll said: ‘I was stunned. It was just mad. Five officers turned up in unmarked police cars. ‘They flashed the search warrant in . my face and said it was lucky I was in so they didn’t have to break my . door down. Everyone has been laughing about it and I think it’s funny. It’s so stupid. ‘The Action Man looked a bit like me so I decided to put it as my Facebook picture. ‘I didn’t even notice the mortar in the background. ‘Over a month later, there were the cops, threatening to bust down my door.’ Mr Driscoll posted the picture on December 7 and the police arrived at his home on January 28. Mortars are portable, short-range weapons used to fire shells or bombs at a steep angle to drop them on to enemy lines. 'I think it's hilarious': Mr Driscoll said he couldn't believe someone thought the gun was real and reported it to the police . Gloucestershire police spokesman .

"It was once the home to hundreds of German miners desperately seeking their fortune in the Namibian desert. But almost 100 years after Kolmanskop peaked as a thriving and bustling oasis, it is now a dilapidated ghost town slowly being reclaimed by the sand. Tourists and photographers now flock to the area to see the formally grand German houses gradually sink into desert. Scroll down for video . The traditional German architecture has been battered by decades of desert winds after Kolmanskop was abandoned by its German founders in 1954 . Kolmanskop thrived in the early 1900s after diamonds were discovered in the sand and was once home to hundreds of German miners and local contract workers . The creepy remains of Kolmanskop have made it a magnet to ghost hunters and it has featured on a number of paranormal series . The eerily empty buildings have been reclaimed by the sand that lies feet deep in places as the dunes encroach on the ghost town . The town was built and abandoned within just 40 years and for decades was then left to the desert. Grand stately homes have been ravaged by the wind and the encroaching dunes have left buildings feet deep in sand. However, mining company De Beers set up a museum in 1980 to preserve some of the history of Kolmanskop. Now tourists come to see the restored buildings and walk around the eerie abandoned homes. Kolmanskop was founded in the early 1900s when diamonds were discovered just sitting on the sand. Railway worker Zacharias Lewala found the gem in 1908 as he dug away from the railway line. The dunes have trapped the ghost town in time and over the decades have even crept around this door and forced it open . The brightly coloured walls of this building have been ravaged by years of strong winds and desert sands . These pictures were taken by photographer Michiel Van Balen and form part of his collection called Devoured By The Desert: Creepy Kolmanskop Ghost Town . Kolmanskop was partly restored by mining company De Beers in 1980 and now form a popular tourist attraction . The ghost town is historically important as the site of Africa's first tram and the southern hemisphere's first X-ray station . He showed it to his boss August Stauch, who got the stone tested and had it confirmed as a diamond. The news sparked a diamond rush on the area and within a few years hundreds of Germans had set up home in the Namib Desert. Kolmanskop grew and soon resembled a . German town. Residents built a hospital, ballroom, power station, . school, skittle alley, theatre and sports hall and an ice factory. The town even boasted the first X-ray station in the southern hemisphere as well as Africa's first tram. By the 1920s, 300 German adults, 40 children and 800 native Owambo contract workers lived in Kolmanskop. The town grew quickly thanks to the diamond rush and had a hospital, ballroom, power station, theatre and sports hall, as well as an ice factory . The unique look of the town has made it a perfect setting for many directors, who have recorded films and TV series at Kolmanskop . The wind is constantly covering and uncovering parts of Kolmanskop as it carries huge amounts of sand in and out of the buildings . The Namibia tourist board said: 'In spite of, or probably because of, the isolation and bleakness of the . surrounding desert, Kolmanskop developed into a lively little haven of . German culture, offering entertainment and recreation to suit the . requirements of the affluent colonialists.' However when the price of diamonds . began to drop after World War One the town began to deteriorate, . particularly after richer diamonds were found further south and it was abandoned in 1954. The ghost town has been used in many South African television series and films and was also the setting for the 2000 film The King Is Alive.","Kolmanskop was founded in the early 1900s when diamonds were found in the desert but abandoned 40 years later .

"The shopping habits of Britain's 25 million supermarket loyalty card holders could be grabbed by the Government in an attempt to halt the UK's dangerous obesity crisis, it was claimed today. People who buy too much alcohol, fatty foods or sugary drinks would be targeted with 'tailored' health advice under plans being considered by the Coalition. With more children than ever dangerously overweight, parents could also be contacted if their bills show they are not giving their offspring a balanced diet from their weekly shop. Cutting obesity-related illness would help the NHS save billions. Nudge: Supermarkets with loyalty cards can collate huge amounts of data about shopping habits and the Government wants to tap into their resources . A Whitehall unit set up to covertly change the habits of Britons has already been in talks with the major supermarkets to gain access to their huge shopping databases. Their loyalty card systems allows them to collate detailed lists of what all their shoppers buy. Around 25 million people have these cards, with Tesco alone having 15 million members. The head of the Government's Behavioural Insights Team said supermarkets had more information on the diets of Britons than their own doctors. David Halpern, the head of the Whitehall team known as the 'nudge . unit', told The Daily Telegraph: 'If you go and buy your stuff regularly, they [the . supermarkets] know exactly what you are buying.' Target: David Cameron, shown shopping earlier this year, is said to back the plan to improve health . Prime Minister David Cameron is said to back these 'nudge' tactics, which are designed to slowly influence the choices of people rather than using Government legislation to force change. But Health Secretary Andrew Lansley and other Tories are said to be opposed to the idea in case they are accused of snooping on the public by employing 'Big Brother' techniques. American academic Richard Thaler, who is an expert on nudge techniques met the cabinet, including the Prime Minister and Chancellor George Osborne this month, to discuss the issue with them. He told them that the information held by Britain's big businesses is key to helping them change behaviour. Groups: Parents who do not buy healthy food for their children would also be sent tailored advice under the plan . The PM has already tried several ideas using nudge techniques with varying degrees of success. A scheme to help people compare energy prices with people in their street worked as did writing to professionals to encourage them to fill in their late tax returns.

"This camel could probably ask for some advice from hot-topic singer Miley Cyrus. After all, popularity often comes with controversy. A commercial starring a talking camel has received over 15 million hits on YouTube but has been labeled as 'disruptive' by teachers at a Connecticut school. Scroll down for video . The popularity of Caleb, a 'talking' camel that stars in a TV ad for the Geico insurance company has created controversy in a Connecticut middle school . The Geico 'Hump Day' ad has many people laughing across America but teachers at Vernon Center Middle School in Vernon, Connecticut, would prefer to put the chatty camel in detention. The problem? Superintendent of Schools Dr. Mary P. Conway told WFSB that some sixth-grade boys at the school were impersonating the camel so much that teachers claimed it was disruptive. 'Everybody's walking around in the hallways and saying its hump day in that weird voice,' student Brooke Lewis said. The issue got a bigger rise as some students began imitating the camel during the entire week and not just on Hump Day. 'Sometimes it's the counting down to when it is,' Lewis said. The television spot features a camel walking around an office annoyingly asking busy workers: 'Guess what day it is? Guess what day it is? Huh? Anybody?' The ad - one of the most popular over summer - makes a play on the term 'Hump Day' which refers to Wednesday being the 'hump' in the middle of the working week. The hook is that camels have humps and is a snappier line than, say, 'Dromedary Day' - especially for a camel that 'talks'. The Geico gecko is a popular star of the insurance company's ads that now include a talking pig and controversial camel . The commercial was made for insurance . provider Geico which has a track record for making quirky animals . famous. The company, which spends about $1 . billion a year on advertising, became well-known for using an urbane . gecko with an English Cockney accent for some of its promotional . material and has also used a pig and a caveman. CBS News reported the concept was created by New York ad agency The Martin Agency. Sean Riley, a creative director with the . agency, said the idea of using a camel in an office was intended to . make people pay attention to the ad. 'We were focused on doing something in . the office and we were focused on doing something surprising and I said . ""camel"" and it went from there,' Riley said. The camel - named Caleb - impressed casting directors with its attitude to acting out in an office. 'We were impressed by his swagger,' said the ad's executive producer Molly Souter. 'He has a natural swagger.' Yet concern from teachers in Connecticut about the talked-about ad is now getting kickback from students and parents. 'I don't really think it is that big of a disruption if people are just doing it in the hallways,' said student Jacob Ruggerio. Jacob's father described the issue as 'silly'. 'I think there's bigger things to take care of in middle schools than that.' said Mick Ruggerio. It was predicted the controversy would blow over by Wednesday. 'It is getting old now, the Hump Day thing, it is getting old,' said parent Beth Lewis. Maxwell the talking pig from insurance provider Geico is another animal star of the company's advertising campaign .","Ad for insurance company disrupts school, claim teachers .

"A water company has replaced an Israeli-built meter in the home of a customer who objected to the 'repression of Palestine'. Caroline and Edmond O'Reilly asked Southern Water to replace the device because the manufacturers, Arad Technologies, are accused of 'profiteering' in the West Bank. The company has now agreed to install a second-hand appliance built by a different manufacturer. Pro-Palestinian campaigners claim the decision paves the thousands of other customers to object to the meters on ethical grounds. Campaign: Protestors in Brighton, including Edmond O'Reilly, pictured on the doorstep, and his wife Carloline, second left, persuaded Southern Water to remove an Israeli-made water meter after objecting to its use on ethical grounds . Mrs O'Reilly, of Brighton, East Sussex, said: 'The letter said they would be round to change my meter this week because of my concerns over its origin. 'I've now got a model that's been refurbished, instead of the new ones they've bought from Arad.' Mrs O'Reilly said her objection was based on the Israeli Government's alleged incursions on to Palestinian land and Arad's connections with the government. She said: 'Since 2000 the Israelis have systematically destroyed the Palestinian water supply infrastructure and Arad supplies the Israeli government. 'Should we turn a blind eye, we collude in supporting a system that is systematically discriminating against people who are powerless against a state that seems to be attempting to drive Palestinians out of Palestine.' Arad Technologies are said to have installed 3,200 water meters in settlement industrial zones in the West Bank. The Israeli company secured a £36 . million contract with Southern Water in February 2010 to provide meters, . meter reading services and data hosting services across Hampshire, . Surrey, Kent and Sussex. Contract: The Israeli company won a £36million contract to provide water meters, pictured, meter reading services and data hosting services for Southern Water across Hampshire, Surrey, Kent and Sussex . It recently announced plans to install 500,000 meters in homes across their region by 2015 in attempt to meet government targets to cut average water use from 148 to 130 litres per person per day by 2030. The cost of installing a meter costs the company up to £200 per house. A spokesman from the Palestine Solidarity Campaign said: 'Southern Water's offer of changing the meter paves the way for thousands of other people to have their meter changed if they wish. 'It costs up to £200 to change a meter. How many people are going to want their Israeli meter out? 'We will be flyering thousands of households across Sussex that are due to have an Arad meter installed as part of Southern Water's metering programme to let them know they don't have to have the Israeli-made device.' Southern Water said this was the first case of its kind since 2010 and that their decision did not reflect a blanket policy. A spokesman for the company said: 'A conclusion should not be drawn that this facility will be offered as an option to all customers. 'Every customer's complaint will be viewed on an individual basis so that appropriate decisions can be made. 'I stress that in three years we have received only about a dozen such requests from nearly 300,000 meter installations and only one request has been agreed. 'In one customer's case we have installed a second-hand conventional meter which was removed from another property in our area which now has the improved Arad meters.'","Caroline and Edmond O'Reilly complained to Southern Water over the meter .

"Alleged culprit: Genesis Hernandez is believed to be one of the two people behind the faked reports of offensive and racist graffiti on Vassar's campus . A string of offensive graffiti messages were made by a transgender student who was a member of a campus group that dealt bias incidents, according to Vassar College officials. One of the two known culprits was revealed as Genesis Hernandez, a transgender student in charge of the Bias Incident Response Team, and officials said that the offending pair were the ones behind some of the graffiti. The school's director of media relations told MailOnline that they have only been able to pinpoint two of the six incidents to the pair, and the investigation into the other incidents is ongoing. The pair are being held responsible to creating those two graffiti and then reporting the offensive messages to college authorities, pretending like they were not involved in their creation. Some of the messages- though it is unclear whether they were the ones attributed to the guilty pair or not- included offensive sentiments such as 'Hey Tranny. Know Your Place' and 'Avoid Being B****es'. Another message found on a student's door was 'F*** N*****', showing that gender identity was not the only bias issue being addressed by the culprit. Vassar sent out an email to students . on November 14 telling them that the school's Bias Incident Response . Team had been told of at least six different messages that were spray . painted on dorm room doors across campus. Disturbing the peace: Vassar College, in upstate New York, became concerned when six alleged instances of bias graffiti were reported, only to learn later that they were staged by the group reporting them . Adding up: The school did not formally name Genesis Hernandez as one of the individuals behind the scheme, but the transgender student dropped out of school and left his prominent positions in student government the same day . The student-led group was designed to formulate the reports and provide support for the victims. Jeff Kosmacher, Vassar director of media relations, told MailOnline the the BIRT is 'a group that gathers and discusses incidents and how the college addresses bias.' The . Daily Caller reports that five days after the initial email was sent, . the school president had to send out another saying that the bias . incidents were perpetrated by two students, one of whom was a leader of . BIRT and actively involved in student government. 'It is our unfortunate duty to report that two Vassar students have admitted responsibility for creating a number of recent bias and hate-speech messages in public spaces on campus,' Vassar president Catharine Hill wrote in the email. 'They also falsely reported these as anonymous messages. Sadly, our community has been deeply hurt by these actions.' Neither of the students' names were listed in the email and it said that they both had left the school voluntarily. Connected: Hernandez, a junior at the school, was a member of the Bias Incident Response Team and allegedly made up the reports of graffiti disparaging African Americans and transgender students . 'Evidence . showed that two students who were responsible for some of the incidents . but... we do not know if they were responsible for all of them,' Mr . Kosmacher said. He said that criminal charges against the pair are 'not in our plans at this time'. One . of the individuals involved remains a mystery, but because of the . others involvement in campus groups, the second has since been reported . to be Genesis Hernandez. Hernandez was a junior at the school and the vice president of student affairs of the Vassar Student Association, which acts as the student government. He was a leader in a number of gay and lesbian support groups on campus and is featured in a video, uploaded to Youtube by Vassar, at an equality rally. While the school's only formal statement on about the suspects was the initial email where they were not named, another clue about Hernandez's involvement came when the president of the Vassar's student government sent out an email announcing the vacated position of vice president.","Six bias incidents of graffiti were reported on the school's campus .

"A blogger who claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby was a hoax aimed at stirring up anti-Islam hatred was arrested in a 2am raid yesterday. Christopher Spivey, 51, a tattoo artist from Rochford, Essex, was arrested on suspicion of harassment via social media after police raided his home and took away computer equipment. Mr Spivey claimed in internet articles that he spent hours researching . footage of Mr Rigby’s killing and the aftermath to 'prove' that the British . establishment had faked the murder to incite hatred towards Muslims. Twisted theory: Christopher Spivey, left, wrote articles on the internet claiming that the murder of Lee Rigby, right, who was run down and then hacked to death in Woolwich, London, last May, was a hoax . It is unclear whether the arrest was made in relation to these articles or another separate case, or cases, of alleged harassment. In a rambling post uploaded to his blog on Tuesday, Mr Spivey claims that there are eight seconds of footage 'missing' from the CCTV footage that captured the death of Drummer Rigby, who was run down and then hacked to death in Woolwich, London, in May last year. He goes on to discuss his theory in extensive detail, sharing 'calculations' that he has made of the speed that the car was travelling at when it hit Lee Rigby. This logic, among other suggestions, shows that the brutal murder was in fact a 'hoax', he claims. Police involved in the investigation would neither confirm nor deny whether the . alleged harassment was connected to Lee Rigby’s mother Lyn Rigby and . stepfather Ian Rigby, who live in Middleton, Manchester. Among Mr Spivey’s online supporters are David Icke, the former footballer and BBC Grandstand presenter who has become known for his conspiracy theories. Mr . Spivey was being held in custody yesterday in Southend, Essex after his arrest, which came about when officers from Essex Police acted on a referral from Greater Manchester Police. He has since been released on police bail pending further inquiries until September 5. An Essex Police spokeswoman said: 'A 51-year-old man from Rochford was arrested by Essex Police on suspicion of harassment in the early hours of Wednesday, July 30. 'Hoax': Christopher Spivey uploaded a rambling blog post on the day before his arrest that offered his skewed take on how the events on 22 May last year unfolded, focusing on CCTV stills like the one pictured . 'He is at Southend Police Station helping officers with their enquires. 'The arrest relates to an allegation of harassment via social media which has been referred to Essex Police by Greater Manchester Police.' Fans took to his blog to speculate on the reasons they thought surrounded the arrest. A message posted on the website yesterday claimed Mr Spivey was 'illegally' arrested. One said: 'They might charge him over the Woolwich hoax.' Another added: 'If the official Woolwich narrative was true, why would they need to bother a grandad, young mother and her baby at 2 o’clock in the morning?' Mr Spivey was also recently critical of Lib Dem deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, portraying him as Hitler on his Facebook page. Killers Michael Adebowale, 23, and Michael Adebolajo, 29 were both sentenced to life in February for the brutal murder of Lee Rigby. Adebolajo received a while life term while Adebowale will serve a minimum of 45 years. The pair ran 25-year-old Fusilier Rigby down in a car before attacking him with a meat cleaver and knives in a frenzied attack. Both pleaded not guilty and claimed to be 'soldiers of Allah' and motivated by the plight of Muslims .

"The US teenager accused of killing two British tourists in 2011 told a friend how he gunned them down as they pleaded for their lives, his trial heard. Shawn . Tyson, 17, is accused of killing James Kouzaris and James Cooper in . April of 2011. He is charged with two counts of first-degree murder and . could face life in prison if convicted. Yesterday, 18-year-old Latrece Washington testified that Tyson told her he . saw the two tourists walking through a housing project in Sarasota, . drunk. James Kouzaris and James Cooper were found . shirtless and with their trousers down but with their . wallets and a small amount of money . Washington testified that Tyson said he intended to rob the two . men, but the men said they had no money. ‘He said “Well since you ain’t got no . money I got something for your ass,”’ Washington recalled Tyson saying . on the day after the killings. Tyson told Washington that the men begged for their lives and one said, ‘please let me go home, I’m lost,’ she said. Recounted . Washington: ‘He shot one of them in the side and one of them fell . instantly and the other one was crying for his life. He shot him.’ Judge Rick De Furia ruled that TV cameras should not broadcast Washington’s face because of fears for her safety. As . testimony continued Monday in the second week of the trial, a portrait . of Tyson began to emerge. He was 16 at the time of the shooting, was . behind in school and had the world ‘Savage’ tattooed on his chest. Shawn Tyson enters the court room on the third day of his murder trial in Sarasota County Court in Florida. Tyson is accused of killing British tourists James Cooper and James Kouzaris in 2011 . He and friends - many of whom had . criminal histories - repeatedly watched Shottas, a 2002 movie about . gangsters in Jamaica and Miami. Kouzaris . and Cooper were in Sarasota on a three-week holiday. On April 15, they . went to dinner and then had drinks in downtown Sarasota. Mr Kouzaris was from Northampton and Mr Cooper was from Hampton Lucy, Warwick. The . pair went to two bars and left on foot early in the morning of April . 16, and somehow strayed into a neighborhood known for its high crime . rates. Witnesses say they . saw Cooper and Kouzaris walking shirtless and stumbling through the . neighbourhood followed by two men, one with a red bandanna around part . of his face. Prosecutors . are trying to link Tyson to the shootings by showing he had a friend . bury .22-calibre bullets in a yard. That was the same calibre of . ammunition used to kill Cooper, 25, and Kouzaris, 24. Jermaine Bane testifies during the third day of Shawn Tyson's murder trial. He told the court Tyson phoned him on the night of the slayings . Defence . lawyers contend there is no evidence linking Tyson to the bullets and . that witnesses tying him to the scene are not credible. Also . on Monday, another witness, Jermaine Bane, said Tyson accidentally . called him the night of the slayings, and Bane heard Tyson say to . someone ‘Who are those crackers walking past the park?’ Shortly after . that, Bane testified he heard gunshots. He described a cracker as a . white person. His friend Mr Bane today told the . court he received several phone calls from Tyson both before and after . he heard gunshots in the early hours of April 16. He . also told the court when police arrived to search Tyson's house later . that day, he saw the teenager - then 16 - throw something into a . friend's car. Mr Bane said . he had been friends with Tyson for about three years. They lived less . than two minutes from each other and would often spend around 10 hours a . day together. Treshaun Simmons testifies at Shawn Tyson's Florida murder trial for the killing of British tourists James Cooper and James Kouzaris. Simmons said he had gone to Tyson's house to get some bullets . He said he often saw Tyson carrying a . 0.22 calibre revolver, usually in his pocket, and had seen him fire it . into the air in the area, known by locals as 'the projects', about four . or five times. On the . evening of April 15, 2011, Mr Bane, Tyson, and two friends spent the . evening together 'smoking and chilling', and visited a Jamaican Club . nearby. The four split up . just after midnight, with Mr Bane and one friend going to Mr Bane's . house, while Tyson headed in a different direction, the court heard. Mr . Bane told the court he received a phone call from Tyson asking if he . got home, but heard him carry on speaking, although he did not think . Tyson was talking to him. He said he heard Tyson say: 'Who are those crackers walking past the park?' Mr Bane said: 'I kept saying 'hello', to see if he knew I was still on the phone.' But Tyson did not answer and Bane hung up the phone. Shortly afterwards, he heard gunshots. James Kouzaris was shot and killed while on holidays with his friends in Florida . James Cooper enjoys his holiday in a bar. A few hours later he was gunned down alongside his university friend James Kouzaris in a rundown area of Sarasota . Mr . Bane said after that his brother Jarius started 'beating down the . door', adding: 'He was very loud like he was scared, like he was about . to knock the door down.' His brother was saying 'they're dead, they're dead', he told the court. Mr Bane said Tyson then called him asking if he had heard gunshots and did he know what happened, and if 'anybody got hit'. 'I told him, 'I don't know 'cus I'm not out there',' he said. 'I wouldn't go out there because I didn't want to step into crossfire or anything.' He said Tyson called him again, and asked him 'repeatedly' to go out and see if the people were dead, but he refused. Later that day, when police arrived to search Tyson's house, Mr Bane said he saw Tyson throw something into a friend's car. 'He went over to the car. He opened the door and threw something in. 'He leaned towards under the seat, the driver's seat.' Judge Rick De Furia oversees Shawn Tyson's murder trial in Sarasota County Court. Tyson is charged with two counts of first-degree murder and could face life in prison if convicted . Mr . Bane originally told police he did not know anything about what had . happened because he did not want 'the image of being a snitch', he said. The . court heard he was arrested in May and charged with carrying a . concealed weapon, but the charge was reduced in seriousness in exchange . for giving evidence in the Tyson trial. Last . week the court heard that phone records showed a series of calls were . made to and from mobile phones registered to Tyson and Mr Bane just . before 3am - around the time of the killing. The court also heard Mr Bane was heard to make a comment that it was the phone calls that had 'f****d him up'. Today he said: 'If it wasn't for the phone calls I wouldn't have been getting questioned. 'I didn't want to be put in the situation where I had to snitch or anything like that.' Jermaine Bane picks out the type of gun allegedly used by Shawn Tyson, who is accused of killing British tourists James Cooper and James Kouzaris . Bane . and his brother, Joshua Bane, both testified that they saw Tyson with a . .22 calibre revolver before the April 16 shootings. Jermaine Bane also . said he was testifying in exchange for authorities reducing a felony . weapon charge against him to a misdemeanor. Another . friend, Treshaun Simmons, said he had been with Tyson and Mr Bane that . night, and when the group split up, he went to Mr Bane's house with him, . and shortly after, they both heard gunshots. Mr Simmons also told the court he had gone to Tyson's house on April 15 to get some bullets. He said: 'I needed bullets for my gun. I walked into Shawn's room....I got a pack of bullets that weren't open.' On Friday, Tyson’s sister was arrested . and charged with retaliating against a witness in connection with . comments she made on Facebook to a woman who testified earlier in the . week.","Shawn Tyson accused of killing James Kouzaris and James Cooper in April 2011 .

Ludo was born,' Peterson told Huffington Post. 'Of course, my poor husband has to sweat his Halloween away, but I think it's worth it. My daughter's dress was originally a wedding dress that I altered a great deal. 'My son's costume was mostly a collection of thrift finds from eBay.

"An unscrupulous couple who operated a £250,000 VAT scam claimed £32,000 a year in benefits to fund their luxury Chelsea penthouse. Emmanuel and Behnaz Scotts received £2,670 a month in housing benefit, covering 60 per cent of their bill for the four-bed apartment in the exclusive Chelsea Harbour. They were also given £1,750 a year in child benefit, which helped to fund a private school education for one of their two daughters. Life of luxury: Behnaz and Emmanuel Scotts received £2,670 a month in housing benefit, which helped to pay for their four-bed apartment in the exclusive Chelsea Harbour . The couple received jobseekers' allowance of £64.30 a week each - which Hammersmith . and Fulham Council said meant it was forced to pay them housing benefit. They were able to live in the same blocks as singer Robbie Williams and sir Michael Caine. Meanwhile Scotts, 44, was conning staff at high-end stores into thinking he was a rich tourist so he could claim tax back on refunded goods. He bought Chanel handbags and jewellery VAT-free and would then get a refund from a different branch on the VAT-inclusive amount. He was jailed for four-and-a-half years while his 42-year-old wife was spared a prison sentence after admitting to transferring profits of £74,000 into her bank account. Emmanuel Scotts, a professional fraudster with . convictions for similar rackets in the UK, Switzerland and . Sweden, also stole £38,000 from a pawnbroker. The Chanel fraud took place from January to June 2009, while he was waiting to be sentenced for an identical fraud at retailers John Lewis and Peter Jones, the Old Bailey was told. Upmarket address: The couple were given 60 per cent of their rent for the elegant property by Hammersmith and Fulham Council . Sarah Giddens, prosecuting, said the couple got to know staff at the central London stores in order to get them to sign forms allowing the fraud to take place. She added: 'The UK retail export scheme is a scheme that allows a traveller to the UK who is not a resident of the UK or EU to purchase goods from participating retailers, inclusive to VAT, to claim back that VAT when they leave the EU. 'This is done using a reclaim form, called the VAT 407. 'This case is all about an abuse of the export system, at Chanel, a luxury boutique shop, selling high level items, often to wealthy visitors to the UK. 'In total they attempted to make a quarter of a million pounds in VAT refunds, but were actually paid £176,000. Ideal home: The couple lived in the tasteful flat with their two daughters while scamming the taxpayer by claiming VAT back on Chanel handbags and jewellery . 'The Scotts used a system whereby they would make a purchase from one Chanel shop, and have it refunded at another. 'Emmanuel Scotts would often visit the shops, appeared friendly, well presented and would get to know they staff very well, who though he was a rich foreign customer. 'He would then present them with a VAT 407 in respect of false invoices, which they would sign.' Ms Giddens said police found rubber stamps at their home, and information on Scotts' laptop which detailed the designs of customs stamps, which he used on the forms. A few weeks later the cash would be transferred into the couple's bank account. In total, Emmanuel Scotts made 33 claims VAT refunds for high end luxury handbags and jewellery worth £250,000 in bank accounts belonging to the couple's false identities. 'Both had changed their name by deed poll, using different email addresses and had different accounts in those names. Waterfront location: The family lived in sophisticated Chelsea, while receiving dole money and £1,750 a year in child benefit . Unethical: Scotts, a professional fraudster with convictions for similar scams in the UK as well as Switzerland and Sweden, also stole £38,000 from a pawn broker . 'In total 75 bank accounts were in their identities, a large number being used in the course of the fraud.' Ms Giddens added that Scotts admitted stealing £37,878 from London pawnbrokers TM Sutton after a cheque bounced when he collected possessions he had left with the shop. In mitigation, Felicia Davy said that while he had a bad record, the cause of his behaviour was a gambling addiction. 'During the time of the offending, he has had a substantial gambling addiction, which he had described as being worse than being on drugs.' Sentencing Emmanuel Scotts to four years for the fraud and six months consecutive for the theft, Judge Richard McGregor-Johnson said: 'This was in my judgement a pre-planned professional exercise. Cheating the system: The Scotts received more than £40,000 a year in benefits while enjoying an opulent lifestyle . 'You established a rapport with members of staff at the stores in order to get them to sign them off. 'You then managed to fraudulently stamp these forms, in order to make a quarter of a million pounds from the tax payer. 'You also committed this at a time when you were awaiting to be sentenced for an identical matter.'This offence therefore requires a substantial time in custody.' Judge McGregor-Johnson sentenced his wife to 51 weeks, suspended for two years. 'You used your bank account to transfer £74,000 of criminal property, and you have a previous conviction for fraud. Extravagant behaviour: The Scotts sent one of their two daughters to private school while Emmanuel indulged a gambling habit . 'However as for you closing you eyes to this matter, you knew your husband's previous convictions and you knew about his background.' Scotts pleaded guilty to cheating the public revenue and theft, and pleaded guilty along with his wife to transferring the proceeds of crime into bank accounts. Martin Brown, Assistant Director for Criminal Investigation at HMRC, said: 'The Scotts thought this fraud was too clever to fail. They passed themselves off as high rollers and spent large sums of criminal cash in expensive boutiques and at casinos. 'They had no idea that HMRC officers were one step ahead and ready to arrest them. Fraudsters should take this as a warning – we will find you and you will have your day in court.'","Couple got £2,670 a month in HOUSING benefit to live in luxury Chelsea flat .

"The U.S. Navy is on a mission to save a baby girl after she fell seriously sick about 900 miles off the Mexico coast, during a round-the-world voyage. San Diego couple Eric and Charlotte Kaufman called for help from the Coast Guard on Thursday, after their youngest daughter, Lyra, fell sick. A team was parachuted in on Thursday to get medical help to the one-year-old, but she needs to be airlifted to hospital. Scroll down for video . Sick bay: Charlotte and Lyra, who had a rash all over. It is believed she had a relapse of salmonella poisoning - which she had suffered from before they left . Stranded: The family's boat, Rebel Heart, is photographed by the rescue team who parachuted in on Thursday . Rescue mission: Air National Guardsmen parachuted into the Pacific on Thursday evening to give medical aid to one-year-old Lyra . The USS Vandegrift is due to rendezvous with the family and their 36ft sailboat Rebel Heart later today, or early tomorrow. It will then whisk Lyra away for medical treatment. The dramatic rescue comes just two weeks after the Kaufmans embarked on their attempt to circumnavigate the globe with their daughters, aged one and three. From the start, the trip had been experiencing difficulties with choppy weather causing sea sickness, but Lyra's health soon took a turn for the worse. When her parents called for help earlier this week, their daughter had developed a rash, was vomiting and had diarrhea. The family had antibiotics on board their well-stocked boat, but they were not working on Lyra. Rendezvous: The baby was successfully transferred to warship USS Vandegrift, pictured Sunday morning . Life savers: The Air National Guardsmen and Navy are making sure the sick toddler gets the help she needs . Her condition has been stabilized, but it is thought that she had contracted salmonella, and is in need of hospital assistance, NBC 7 reported. Four members of the Air National Guard have remained on board the Rebel Heart with the family, to monitor the little girl. A spokesman for Moffett Federal Airfield in California, where the rescue is being coordinated, said: 'The vessel’s remote location as well as the infant’s urgent need for medical care necessitated the rescue. 'The 129th pararescuemen who saved the child’s life will remain with her until she reaches a medical facility capable of treating her conditions.' To make matters worse, the Rebel Heart had become stranded hundreds of miles off Cabo San Lucas in Mexico, with no way to steer or communicate. Rough seas: Eric and Charlotte have faced criticism over their trip - not least from their family. But they have defended their actions . Off course: The family set sail from San Diego on March 20 but had to call for help on April 3, 900 nautical miles of Mexico . On Friday afternoon, an update was posted on the family's Facebook page saying that the rescue mission was underway. 'I just got off the phone with the Lt. Col in charge of this mission. Lyra is stable. They have got the boat running!' the post, made by a relative, read. 'They have turned around and are heading to Cabo. There is a Navy ship heading to meet them. If anything changes with Lyra they will med vac her out.' The head of the rescue mission, Major Hank Lutz said the family had been given access to full medical back up to make sure Lyra stays healthy. 'We have a doctor, a flight surgeon, that's on call right now in Cabo San Lucas, and through their sat phone they can call her in case they need anything that's more advanced than just simple paramedic,' he told ABC News. Giant swells in the section of ocean the family's sailboat is in has complicated the rescue mission. The Navy ship is needed to provide a more stable platform for a helicopter to airlift Lyra away. Adventure: The lure of South Pacific islands encouraged Eric to set sail with his wife and two young daughters . 'With the swells out there, it's moving around a lot more so it's not a stable platform to hoist off of,' helicopter instructor pilot Major Nathan Nowaski said. Once the Rebel Heart has met the USS Vandegrift, it will take a further 14 hours for helicopters to make the round trip to collect the young patient. The dramatic rescue is far from what the couple, who are experienced sailors, had anticipated when they decided to embark on a trip to the lush islands of the South Pacific. On their blog - The Rebel Heart - they wrote of excitedly waiting on March 20 for the right conditions before setting sail on the well-stocked boat. Home from home: The family planned to sail around the world on Rebel Heart, a 36ft boat . With a toddler just learning to walk, . and a curious three-year-old on board, the couple knew their voyage . wouldn't all be plain sailing, but they could never have predicted that . they would be calling for help so quickly. In . her early blog posts about the voyage Mrs Kaufman, a teacher and owner . of an Etsy baby boutique, wrote about trying to keep a constant watch on . their girls, as she coped with seasickness. Day One  I can see the magic of being out to sea, but I can’t really taste it. Our children keep us too grounded to enjoy the esoterics of salty breezes, gigantic swells undulating around your boat like an erotic hula dancer, and a night sky dancing with laser beams of brilliance. Day Two Our foresail, stay sail, and main sail, hold fast, all strong and white, like our painted wooden mast, and I can feel their excitement to be used like this again; they were made for blue-water sailing, and apparently, so were we. Day Four Today started out sh**** too. It is so hard to keep a positive outlook at sea when you feel awful. Day Six I can’t possibly describe the range of emotions I have felt so far: anger, joy, sickness, exhaustion, exhilaration, wonder, awe, contentment, peace. Day Eight I think this may be the stupidest thing we have ever done ... [but] not everyone gets to realize their dreams in life. Day Eleven When I woke up this morning my back muscles were tight from the constant rocking you can’t escape at night. Day Thirteen Thirteen days at sea ... We are in good spirits, as good as you can be, considering. Three days later the family contacted the Coast Guard for help . As . well as needing space to keep their children entertained, the couple had filled the boat with supplies of cans, dried good, diapers and . fresh food. But despite . choppy conditions, the family were relishing their adventure, singing . and laughing in the cabin, and showering on deck as their boat glided . through the Pacific. On the second day of their voyage, Mrs Kaufman wrote: 'It is simple things that excite a crew when out to sea ... like the turtle calmly paddling in the opposite direction as us.' She also described how she and her husband, who works for a financial services company, gave each other fist bumps when they first realized they could no longer see land in any direction. But the exotic and remote South Pacific islands where they were headed must have seemed like a distant dream when their youngest daughter fell sick. The romance of life at sea was replaced with a longing for modern appliances like washing machines that other families rely so heavily on. In one blog post, Mrs Kaufman wrote: 'I think this may be the stupidest thing we have ever done,' as she described the difficulty of trying to hand wash poopy diapers. The biggest trial came when Lyra suffered illness for several days, resulting in the family calling for help from the Coast Guard, the UT San Diego reported. It is not the . first time the couple have had to rechart their planned course across . the South Pacific. They have been slowly circumnavigating the world since buying their boat in 2005 and attempted a different section of the voyage when Mrs Kaufman was pregnant with their second . child. Dream voyage: The family have had to cut short their planned trip across the South Pacific . Back on dry land: The family are heading back to shore after suffering sickness and boat problems . However, a combination of morning sickness, sea sickness and a toddler in tow meant Mrs Kaufman returned to shore. As she wrote about the experiences in San Diego Magazine, she mused on how pleased she was to have returned to dry land, after suffering a couple of pregnancy complications which would have been difficult to handle out to sea. It is not clear if the family will try to embark on their South Pacific adventure again, but the lure of far-flung islands is bound to have them longing for the open ocean before long.","USS Vandegrift sent in to help airlift one-year-old to safety .

"President Barack Obama will cut short his three-day trip to India and visit Saudi Arabia to pay respects after the death of King Abdullah, U.S. and Indian officials said Saturday. The schedule change, announced shortly before Obama left for India, means the president will skip plans to see the Taj Mahal, and instead pay a call on an influential U.S. ally in the volatile Mideast. The king, who died Friday, was aggressive in trying to check the spreading power of Saudi Arabia's chief rival, Iran. Obama visited the ailing monarch in his desert compound last March. Scroll down for video . Paying respects: President Barack Obama met with Saudi King Abdullah in March 2013. He has now cut short his three-day trip to India to travel to Saudi Arabia to pay respects following the death of King Abdulla . Heading east: President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, wave as they board Air Force One before departing Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland for a trip to India . Stopover: Air Force One with President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama aboard departs, Mr bama has canceled the end of his trip to India to fly to Saudi Arabia in the wake of the death of its late ruler . White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the president and first lady Michelle Obama would travel to Riyadh on Tuesday and meet with new Saudi King Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud. Vice President Joe Biden was to lead a U.S. delegation, but Earnest said the White House changed plans after determining that Biden's trip coincided with Obama's departure from India. Biden will remain in Washington. The more substantive portions of Obama's trip to India appeared unlikely to change. Obama was due to arrive Sunday for meetings with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, then attend Monday's annual Republic Day festivities, which mark the day in 1950 that India's constitution came into force. Relations between the world's two largest democracies are strengthening after recent tensions. Obama and Modi developed a good rapport during the prime minister's visit in Washington last fall. Modi's invitation to Obama caught some in the U.S. off guard. Tribute: Obama, who visited with the ailing king in his desert compound last March, praised Abdullah for taking 'bold steps' in advancing the Arab Peace Initiative . 'It took us by some surprise,' said Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser. 'There's a great affinity between the United States and India and our people, but there's also a history that is complicated and that would have made it seem highly unlikely that a U.S. president would be sitting with India's leaders at their Republic Day ceremony.' Next in line: Saudi state TV has announced that Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud will be the next King of Saudi Arabia . While in India, Obama also planned to meet with Modi and attend an economic summit with U.S. and Indian business leaders. Obama will be the first U.S. president to visit India twice while in office; he also traveled there in 2010 for an economic summit. His trip was expected to be heavy on symbolism and lighter on substantive advances, though climate change, economics and defense ties are on the agenda. Still, U.S. and Indian officials appear to agree that even a symbolic show of solidarity would mark progress after recent difficulties. While military cooperation and U.S. defense sales have grown, Washington has been frustrated by India's failure to open up to more foreign investment and to address complaints alleging intellectual property violations. India's liability legislation has also prevented U.S. companies from capitalizing on a landmark civil nuclear agreement between the two countries in 2008. Relations hit a new low in 2013 when India's deputy consul general was arrested and strip-searched in New York over allegations that she lied on visa forms to bring her maid to the U.S. while paying the woman a pittance. The official's treatment caused outrage in New Delhi, and India retaliated against U.S. diplomats. Protest: Activists from Communist Party of India-Marxist hold placards and shout slogans during a protest against U.S. President Barack Obama's visit to India. Obama is due to arrive in New Delhi on Sunday . Vocal: Obama will be the first American president to attend India's annual Republic Day Parade. The banner at right reads: 'We condemn the visit of U.S. president and stop interfering in our issues' Modi's hosting of Obama caps a year of high-profile diplomatic maneuvers by a leader denied a U.S. visa in 2005, three years after religious riots killed more than 1,000 Muslims in the Indian state where he was the top elected official. The visit ties in with Modi's election promise that he would turn around Asia's third-largest economy. It also could send a message to Pakistan and China - India's closest neighbors and rivals - that Modi has a powerful ally in the United States. The White House plans to push India on climate change, particularly after reaching a sweeping agreement with China on limiting carbon emissions. Accompanying Obama are several U.S. business leaders hoping to forge new partnerships with India.","President Barack Obama will stop in Riyadh to pay respects to Saudi royals .

"As fireworks lit up the heavens above the Olympics opening ceremony, watched by around a billion people, something else was seen among the whizz-bangs in the night sky... a UFO. It may have ticked all the cliche boxes - saucer-shaped, bulge in the middle, metallic - but no one has yet stepped forward to explain the slow-moving object. The incident came right at the close of last Friday's spectacular at the Olympic Park stadium in Stratford, east London at around 12.30am. And it was just as Nick Pope, one of the UK’s top UFO experts, predicted only weeks ago - that mass summer events would be a prime time for crafts from other . worlds to present themselves to mankind. Scroll down for video . This UFO was seen at the Olympics opening ceremony in Stratford, east London . It may have ticked all the cliche boxes - saucer-shaped, bulge in the middle, metallic - but no one has yet stepped forward to explain the slow-moving object . One theory is that the 'spaceship', whose presence was reported by Examiner.com, was a blimp used by a news channel to gather footage. But . while NBC Olympics - a division of NBC Sports - has picked Goodyear . blimps for all of its 2012 Olympics aerial coverage, the object does not . look like one of the floating airships. Some commentators on YouTube believe it is actually a helicopter - or simply a fake. Mr Pope, who worked at the Ministry of Defence . for 20 years, investigated reports of UFOs between 1991 and 1994. One theory is that the object was a blimp or helicopter used to gather aerial footage . Aliens may be visiting Earth for military reconnaissance, scientific research, or just to enjoy the scenery and partake in some tourism . Here are some of the theories regarding the Olympics UFO... He began his research as a sceptic, before becoming convinced that . the sightings raised important defence issues for national security and air . safety. Speaking earlier this month, he said: 'It has been a widely held . belief in Ministry of Defence circles that ""aliens"" have been able to . detect us for decades via TV and radio broadcasts. 'What once seemed like science fiction is steadily being realised by central governing bodies as distinctly real. 'If aliens have studied our . psychology, they may choose to appear in our skies on a significant date. 'The closing ceremony of the Olympic Games is one date being widely . circulated by conspiracy groups.’ The footage is believed to have originated from a web user known as 'MrScipher'. UFO expert Nick Pope (above) predicted the London Olympics would be a prime time for extraterrestrials to make an appearance . Tony Blair and the 'UFO cover-up' Two weeks ago, it was revealed that former prime minister Tony Blair . received a briefing about UFOs from the Ministry of Defence because of . his concerns over the disclosure of classified information on alien . life-forms. Downing Street . requested the advice for the PM in 1998 as the Freedom of Information . Act was being introduced, which allowed the public to obtain information . on alien mysteries. Ex-PM Tony Blair received a briefing about UFOs from the Ministry of Defence because of his concerns over the disclosure of classified information on extraterrestrials . Mr . Blair's concerns were raised after he received a letter from a member of . the public referring to a 'cover-up' and asking him to make UFO reports . and other information available. According to The Daily Telegraph, Mr Blair sought advice from the MoD for its policy on the issue. He . was told by staff at the ministry that it has 'only a limited interest . in UFO matters' but that they ' remained open-minded' about . 'extraterrestrial life forms'. Details . of the briefing emerged ahead of a release of files on July 12 by . the Government of more than 6,700 pages  detailing seemingly close . encounters with UFOs over the last 30 years. Among . a series of UFO sightings in the files is a  policeman's report of a . mystery cluster of lights darting across the sky during an FA Cup replay . between Chelsea and Manchester United. The . mounted officer's claims to have seen the bright object hovering over . Stamford Bridge in March 1999 for almost 15 seconds, slowly changing . shape, were corroborated by a colleague. The . ‘credible witness report’ is one of a series investigated by the . Ministry of Defence, whose top-secret files are being released in . sections by the National Archives following the closure of the . ministry’s UFO desk in 2009. One confidential 1995 report by the . defence official responsible for manning the desk says the presence of . extra-terrestrial lifeforms is ‘possible’, although there is ‘no direct . evidence’. It also speculates on the reasons why . aliens may be visiting Earth, including for military reconnaissance, . scientific research, or just to enjoy the scenery and partake in some . tourism. The . policeman claimed that he saw something ‘unlike anything I’ve seen . before’ at Stamford Bridge while Manchester United beat Chelsea 2-0 in . the FA Cup quarter final replay .

"The amount of messages being sent using chat apps, including Whatsapp, Apple's iMessage, and BlackBerry Messenger, has overtaken text messages for the first time ever. A study by Informa, commissioned by the Financial Times, found that almost 19 billion instant messages were sent using chat apps in 2012, compared to 17.6 billion SMS texts. And separate research, from Ovum, found that mobile networks lost out on $25bn . (£16.1bn) from texting in revenue last year, because of this rise in chat apps, with this figure expected . to rise to $34bn (£21.9bn) in 2013. Instant messaging using chat apps, such as Whatsapp and Apple's iMessage is now more popular than sending texts. Last year 19 billion instant messages were sent, compared to 17.6 million texts . Combining elements of text messaging and . social networking, the apps allow photos, music and video to be easily shared. Waterloo, Ontario-based Kik has racked up 40 million users since launching in 2010. Silicon Valley entrants in the race . include Whatsapp, funded by Sequoia Capital, and MessageMe, launched . earlier this month by a group of viral game makers. MessageMe has received seed-stage . funding from True Ventures and First Round Capital, among others, and . claimed 1 million downloads in its first week. Meanwhile, Asian companies are producing some of the fastest-growing apps in history. Tencent's WeChat boasts 400 million . users - far more than Twitter, by way of comparison - while LINE and . KakaoTalk claim 120 million and 80 million users, respectively . Informa is even predicting that by 2014, instant messages will outweigh text messages almost two-to-one with Informa analyst Pamela Clark-Dickson adding that some operators were already 'seeing a decline.' Whatsapp's popularity, in particular was highlighted last week, when Nokia unveiled the first phone to have a Whatsapp button built-in. Informa found that there were 3.5 billion people using SMS in 2012, compared to only 586.3 million users of the six main chat apps - WhatsApp, BlackBerry Messenger, Viber, Nimbuzz, Apple’s iMessage and KakaoTalk. These services have a combined 586.3 million users. Yet, the average chat app users sent 32.6 messages a day, whereas SMS users sent just five a day. The research also didn't take into account services such as Facebook Messenger for Android. That said, Informa is quick to claim that SMS isn't going to be wiped out just yet. Dickson-Clark adds there is 'a lot of life still in SMS' because every phone can use SMS, but chat apps are reserved to smartphones. She also claims that SMS can be sent any time, when you have a network connection. Alternatively, chat apps rely on you having a mobile data connection, or Wi-Fi. Nokia's Asha 210, the first phone to have a Whatsapp button built-in . A recent study of 5,000 US teens by PiperJaffray in April found that chat apps were also having an impact on social network sites, such as Facebook and Twitter.

"First there was a website that predicted when your parents would die; now there's a watch that not only predicts when you will die, it also begins counting down. Users fill out a questionnaire about their medical history before subtracting their age from the overall results to get their death score. This score is entered into the Tikker and the countdown begins. Dubbed the 'death watch', Tikker has been created by Swedish inventor Fredrik Colting but far from being morbid, Colting calls it 'The Happiness Watch' and claims it has been designed to help people make the most of their life and cherish the time they have left.

"A doctor who is running for a Republican Kansas senate seat has been exposed after he uploaded X-ray images of patients' fatal injuries to Facebook and made fun of them. Dr. Milton Wolf, a radiologist and distant cousin of President Barack Obama who practices in Kansas City, told The Topeka Capital-Journal that he uploaded the photos for 'educational purposes.' The paper maintains that the images were accompanied by Facebook comments made by Wolf and others making fun of dead or wounded patients. Wolf has come under fire from members of the public, as well as from a spokesperson for political rival Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS). Scroll down for video . Dr. Milton Wolf has maintained that the photos were uploaded to Facebook for 'educational purposes' Seen here with wife Karrie, Wolf is a distant relative of President Barack Obama . Milton Wolf, seen here in an image from his Facebook page, allegedly uploaded grisly photos of patients' X-rays to Facebook and 'made fun' of them. He is currently running for US Senate in Kansas . An image of a deadly bullet wound to . one's patient's head, uploaded to Wolf's Facebook in January was . accompanied by a series of chilling comments, the paper says. Responding to a fellow user who complained when asked to straighten the patient's head, Wolf allegedly wrote 'Sheesh Melissa, it's not like the patient was going to complain.' Wolf also allegedly wrote macabre comments about another patient who received a gun wound to the head and survived. 'One of my all-time favorites,' he allegedly wrote on the social media site. 'From my residency days ... there was a pretty active 'knife and gun club' at Truman Medical Center. What kind of gun blows someone's head completely off? I gotta get me one of those.' He later added, 'It reminds [me] of the scene from Terminator 2 when they shoot the liquid metal terminator guy in the face at close range and it kind of splits him open temporarily almost like a flower blooming. We all find beauty in different things.' Wolf, seen here in this Facebook photo taken at a Kansas City town hall, apologized for his online activity in a written statement on his website . On The WolfFiles.com, an X-ray was described as his '2nd favorite gunshot wound of all time' TheWolfFiles.com, a political blog . authored by Wolf, included a post on an X-ray of a gunshot wound, titled . 'My Guess: A Jealous Husband or a Jilted Lover.' 'This . is my 2nd favorite gunshot wound of all time,' he wrote. 'I wish I . could tell you the story behind this awesome X-ray, but this patient . came through the ER and they don't believe in obtaining patient . histories (I wish I was kidding). I'm guessing a jealous husband or a . jilted lover. I mean...2 gunshot wounds...to the back.' Wolf, when pressed by the paper, reportedly did not respond to questions asking if he continued to upload these types of photos online. He then published an statement about the photos on his campaign website. 'Several years ago I made some comments about these images that were insensitive to the seriousness of what the images revealed. Soon thereafter, I removed those images and comments, again several years ago.' Wolf seemed to imply that that rival Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS) was involved in the photos' recent release. 'For them to be published in a much more public context now, by a political adversary who would rather declare war on doctors than answer serious questions that Kansans have, is truly sad.  However, my mistakes are my own and I take full responsibility for them.' Seen with his wife and children in this Facebook image, Wolf even allegedly referred to one of the graphic X-ray images he uploaded as 'One of my all-time favorites' and said 'We all find beauty in different things' A spokesman for Roberts, Leroy Towns, expressed his concerns about Wolf's behavior to The Topeka Capital-Journal. 'For any doctor to make patient . records public and then use the . records for public discussion and entertainment is just unthinkable,' he . said. 'Allegations of such lack of judgment demand extensive . scrutiny and investigation.' Twitter users have also criticized the would-be politician. 'There will always be jerks, but are we having a jerk-epidemic in our country?,' wrote one. Another user said '#DrMiltonWolf, #SenateCandidate under fire for posting grisly images to Facebook, how stupid are you?' 'That Milton Wolf seems like one classy dude,' another user wrote, apparently sarcastically. Wolf has been married to wife Karrie Wolf for 23 years and they have two children. He has also mentioned that he is related to the president repeatedly when criticizing his health care plan in his book 'Do No Harm: The President's Cousin Explains Why His Hippocratic Oath Requires Him to Oppose ObamaCare.' He has also won support from groups associated with the Tea Party. Roberts, despite having high marks with conservative watchdog groups like Heritage Action for America and FreedomWorks, has recently come under scrutiny for his actual residency, Politico reports. A New York Times article revealed Roberts owns a Virginia home and is registered to vote at the address of two donors rather than his own Kansas property.","Dr. Milton Wolf, a radiologist and distant cousin of President Obama, reportedly uploaded the images to Facebook in 2010 .

"Infuriated: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has accused the BBC's Stephanie Flanders of showing a pro-Labour bias (file photo) A major row erupted after a Cabinet Minister accused BBC Economics Editor Stephanie Flanders of showing a pro-Labour bias by undermining the Government’s jobs claims. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has made a formal complaint to the BBC about its ‘carping and moaning’. He singled out Ms Flanders over her coverage of figures that showed unemployment and welfare handouts are falling in spite of the slump. In an interview with The  Mail on Sunday, he claimed that the BBC backs the economic stance of Labour leader Ed Miliband and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls and seizes every chance to ‘dump on the Government’. And he accused influential Ms Flanders of ‘pouring cold water’ over the rise in employment and ‘peeing all over’ British business. He said the BBC had ‘set up’ an interview with a self-employed nurse who agreed when Ms Flanders suggested that she was among the ‘hidden unemployed’. Last week’s recession-defying leap in jobs in the three months to June surprised experts. Mr Duncan Smith claimed it was evidence that Government policies are working. He was furious when Ms Flanders questioned the figures in the BBC Six O’Clock and Ten O’Clock TV news on Wednesday – and did not screen an interview with him proclaiming the Coalition’s success. On screen, she said: ‘Britain’s jobs numbers are a puzzle which keeps getting harder to solve. Of course it’s good news .  .  . but it is not necessarily good news for us or the Chancellor if we are needing more people as a country to make less stuff.’ Ms Flanders claimed ‘hidden unemployment’ could be ‘lurking behind the statistics’. She interviewed nurse Jacqui Connell, who was made redundant last year and is now self-employed, taking her off the dole register. Ms Connell agreed: ‘I do think I’m a hidden figure.’ Ms Flanders added that ‘many in the City’ expected dole queues to rise over the coming months. Singled out: Stephanie Flanders, the BBC's influential economics editor, was accused of 'peeing all over British business' by Iain Duncan Smith . She was echoed by BBC2 Newsnight economics editor Paul Mason, who said Britain had ‘recoveryless jobs’ that were ‘great for those who got them’ but ‘not so great for digging ourselves out of this mess’. The BBC returned to the issue  yesterday on the Radio 4 Today  programme. Presenter Sarah Montague said: ‘When the economy gets smaller, you would expect unemployment to go up. But something strange is going on.’ Mr Duncan Smith told this newspaper: ‘The BBC is locked to the reading of the economy that is run out of Ed Miliband and Ed Balls’ office. They think if only you spend and borrow more money you can create growth everywhere. This is the general tenor of everything that comes out of the BBC. ‘They expected the [employment] figures to be flatlining. They  convinced themselves youth unemployment would continue to rise,  but when it fell they were in a  complete quandary. ‘Stephanie Flanders poured cold water over the whole thing. She said, “Of course this is good news, but it could be because we aren’t productive enough.” ‘Then she got a woman who was set up as a health worker who has gone self-employed – as though being self-employed is not legitimate – and she [Flanders] said, “This is all hidden unemployment because they are self-employed.” ‘Guess what the self-employed person said? “I could be some of the hidden unemployment figures.” ‘They had popped those words into her mouth. They had come in and said “let’s just sit on this and flatten it”. If the unemployment figures had gone up, we would have been on the BBC TV News at Six and Ten and would have got the blame.’ Mr Duncan Smith claimed the  coverage was part of a pattern. ‘When the news is good, the BBC view is “get the Government out of the picture quickly, don’t allow them to say anything about it”. When the news is bad, [it’s] “let’s all dump on the Government”,’ he went on. He also claimed the BBC ‘sought every little bit of bad news’ on jobs, adding: ‘Last month, there was a marginal rise in youth unemployment so they centred on that. ‘This time it came down so they cast doubt on the figures. [Flanders] said it could be industry is so bad they have to take on two people where one person could do the job. ‘She was peeing all over British industry and the private sector. It was terrible. Our private industry is unbelievably robust compared to much of Europe. ‘We were all told, “It’s no good, you can’t lay off these public sector workers, they’ll never find jobs, the private sector will never expand.” ‘When we got elected the public sector was squeezing the hell out of the private sector. Now it has created nearly one million new jobs.’  Mr Duncan Smith has made a formal complaint to BBC head of news Helen Boaden about its coverage of the Government’s crackdown on the workshy and benefits scroungers. He said: ‘Some people on sickness benefit have not been checked for ten years even though their condition has improved. ‘They are used to getting their money with no requirement to get a job and have an “I don’t have to work if I don’t want to” attitude. Yet the BBC has said nothing about that. All we get is carping and moaning.’ Defiant Mr Duncan Smith insists the Government’s rigorous new checks on people on benefits are succeeding, and says tougher measures are to come. He added: ‘All the chasing of inactive people into work is having a big effect. The figures for work experience for young people – that the Left hate and call slave labour – show around 50 per cent are coming off benefits and getting into work. ‘The BBC doesn’t understand times have changed. As a nation we are near on bust. We have a massive deficit and no longer live in the land of milk and honey where we can solve problems by throwing money at them.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘BBC News is confident our coverage of this story was impartial, fair and balanced, reflecting a wide range of views. Indeed, Mr Duncan Smith expressed his position on several BBC outlets. Stephanie interrogated numerous aspects of the figures in her analysis. She echoed questions raised by many experts, including the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, as well as noting the rise in the number of people in work was good news.’ Ms Flanders, 44, is the daughter  of British actor and comic singer Michael Flanders, of Flanders  and Swann fame. She attended the fee-paying St Paul’s Girls’ School in London and studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford. She lives with long-term partner John Arlidge and their two children in a £1 million West London home.","Iain Duncan Smith has made a formal complaint to the BBC over its coverage of employment figures .

"Thieves who stole a precious parrot which loves to belt out Queen songs are 'under pressure' to return her. Eight-year-old Chico likes to squawk famous lines such as 'Gallileo, Gallileo' and ‘Scaramouche’ after she learned the lyrics by listening to a greatest hits CD. The red-tailed African grey, who was stolen from Malcolm Booth's . home in Hattersley, Greater Manchester on Sunday, also loves the rock group's famous tracks ‘We are the Champions' and 'Killer Queen.' Now 44-year-old Mr Booth hopes Chico's renditions will drive her captors round the bend and hand her back. Chico time: The African grey parrot was stolen from his cage during a burglary . Mr Booth who has had the bird since she was a three-week old baby said she would be making quite a flap. He said: 'I’m a great fan of Queen and am used to Chico squawking and whistling their tunes but I’m not sure its everyone’s cup of tea. 'I don’t think the people who have her will appreciate her squawking ‘Scaramouche’, ‘Gallileo’ and ‘I’m just a poor boy’ at them all the time. In fact I think it will drive them up the wall. 'Chico loves her music and whenever I put her in her cage I always put the music channel on for her.' Cage flighter: Owner Malcolm Booth is desperate to get his beloved pet parrot Chico returned safely . The father of two, bought his beloved pet from a breeder when his Timneh Grey parrot passed away. He has spent eight years training her to speak, sing and perform tricks at the home he shares with son, Kieran, 13. The clever polly can recognise colours and put them into the correct boxes as well as playing football, saying please and thank you and squawking out the names of family members. The Sound of silence: The normally noisy cage belonging to Chico the singing parrot sits empty . Mr Booth added: 'Chico’s a bit of a handful but she’s a well loved family pet. She will tell my son off if he’s been naughty and if a girl comes in she’ll do a wolf whistle. 'She wouldn’t bite because she’s hand-reared. Mostly it’s just a little nip but then she’ll lick you. If she wants feeding, it’s ‘Malc please’. 'I only called her Chico because she was cheeky when she first came. At the time I paid £650 for her, but now she’s talking and doing tricks she’s worth up to £900-£1000. Feathery fan: Chico loves to whistle Queen songs performed by the late Freddie Mercury . Mr Booth said he was doing some gardening at his brother-in-law’s when Chico disappeared on Sunday afternoon, and he believes that the thieves broke into the empty house after Kieran and Malcolm’s older son, Christian, 17, accidentally left the kitchen window open while cooking. The offenders escaped with a Playstation 3 and the parrot after breaking open the door of its cage. Malcolm added: 'She is normally in a cage. If I had left her out, they wouldn’t have caught her because she wouldn’t have come to them unless they shouted her name.' He added: ' I don’t need an alarm clock in this house . because she’s shouting Kieran at 5-6am, and it’s not quiet. 'It’s a four-bedroom house and when I’m in the far bedroom I can hear her with the door shut.' Mr Booth is appealing to the public for . any information that can help return his pet to him. Bohemian bird: The members of Queen in the classic pose for Chico's favourite, their 1975 hit Bohemian Rhapsody . He said: 'All I want is my bird back. The person that stole it can bring it back and I’ll give them the rest of my games that they’ve missed. They can keep the PS3, I’m not bothered, my bird was a family member.' Detective Constable Barbara Offord at Greater Manchester Police said: 'Many people forge strong relationships with their pets and this case is no exception. Chico is a much loved member of the family and they are desperate for his return.","Chico the bird belts out lines from Bohemian Rhapsody .

"Members of Congress on the political right are seething over the Obama administration's apparent plan to turn as many as 34 million illegal immigrants into legal U.S. residents, with one lawmaker claiming the president is engaged in 'covert actions to prepare for tens of millions of amnesty cases.' Rep. Lou Barletta, a Pennsylvania Republican,said Thursday that recent reports of a government program to mass-purchase blank 'green cards' and work permits are 'proof that the groundwork is already being laid to grant amnesty post-election to millions upon millions of people who have broken our laws to enter this country.' 'The administration already has exceeded its authority to manipulate our immigration laws, and it is jarring to see the sheer scale of his future plans to do more,' he said. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued a draft proposal this month, seeking a vendor to produce the paperwork that authorizes illegal immigrants to live and work in the United States. The White House is preparing to issue an immigration-related executive order after the Nov. 4 midterm elections. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO AND THE DOCUMENTS . '#Not1More': An immigration activist heckled President Barack Obama on Sunday as he spoke during a campaign event for Democratic Maryland gubernatorial candidate Anthony Brown . Along with its solicitation for blank green cards and work permits, USCIS published images showing what the finished cards will look like . According to that online solicitation, the agency will look for a company that can produce a minimum 4 million cards per year for five years, and 9 million in the early stages. The draft came complete with photos of what the finished cards will look like. President Barack Obama has pledged that he will make a move on immigration reform this year. His original timetable called for a decision by the end of the summer. Republicans have decried the plan as an 'amnesty' for millions of illegal immigrants, including hundreds of thousands of unaccompanied minors who have come across the U.S.-Mexico border this year. 'This revelation provides startling confirmation of the crisis facing our Republic,' Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jeff Sessions said in a statement. The Alabama Republican accused Obama of 'preparing to issue work authorization and ""legal"" status to millions of individuals illegally present in the country, in violation of plain statute,' in a bid to 'nullify the immigration laws of the United States and its sovereign people.' Barletta, the Pennsylvanian, added that U.S. immigration law serves two purposes: 'to protect the safety of Americans, and to protect American jobs. The president’s covert actions to prepare for tens of millions of amnesty cases undermine both of those principles.' USCIS spokesman Christopher Bentley told the Associated Press that the proposal was a routine contract offer. 'Solicitations of this nature are frequent practice,' he said, claiming the number of immigration applications can rise 'for any number of any reasons.' Advocates for Mexican and Central American immigrants have lambasted Obama for deporting illegal aliens even though the numbers are down sharply. This Sept. 8 protest in front of the White House featured a crying young boy (left) whose father was deported . Obama delayed his immigration action until after the midterm congressional election to avoid alienating law-and-order voters, but can afford to frustrate illegal imigrants – who can't legally cast ballots . A USCIS official told MailOnline earlier in the week that the draft was published 'in case the president makes the move we think he will,' but added that the agency's Document Management Division (DMD) is by no means committed to buying the materials. Another agency official  said the proposal was drafted as a contingency in case immigration reform legislation passes in Congress, not in anticipation of action from the White House. At the White House on Wednesday, a glib press secretary Josh Earnest claimed the White House does not 'micromanage' the 'ordering of specific colored sheets of paper' by government agencies. 'Don’t be absurd with us,' a CBS News reporter shot back. 'That’s not just an ordinary colored piece of paper. It is central to what the president has promised in public to do in public.' The online draft explains that 'DMD requires card consumables for the production of USCIS' Permanent Resident Card (PRC) and Employment Authorization Document (EAD) cards.' 'These cards and related consumables, when assembled, become highly specialized and secure identification documents.' And a successful bid, the draft solicitation says, will be able to support a 'potential ""surge"" in PRC and EAD card demand for up to 9M (9 million) cards during the initial period of performance to support possible future immigration reform initiative requirements.' Green cards are issued once to each recipient. Work authorizations are renewed annually. Former State Department foreign service officer Jessica Vaughan, now an immigration expert at the Center for Immigration Studies, told Breitbart.com that the RFP 'seems to indicate that the president is contemplating an enormous executive action that is even more expansive than the plan that Congress rejected in the 'Gang of Eight' bill.' That legislation, which passed in the U.S. Senate last year only to be stalled in the House of Representatives, was a broad reboot of American immigration policy that won support from a handful of Republicans. In included a provision to provide a pathway to citizenship for so-called 'dreamers' – people living in the country illegally who were brought to Americans as children before June 15, 2007. Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which he ultimately enacted without congressional support, uses the EAD cards as part of its implementation. USCIS says it processed 862,000 EADs overall between January and June of this year. But 'the guaranteed minimum for each ordering period is 4,000,000 cards,' according to the draft RFP. 'The estimated maximum for the entire contract is 34,000,000 cards.' The company that ultimately wins the contract will also be required to store the blank cards until the government needs them.

"Apple fell further behind rival Samsung in the battle of the smartphones with iPhone sales slowing and profits falling for the first time in ten years.

However he assured shareholders: ‘Our . teams are hard at work on some amazing new hardware, software, and . services and we are very excited about the products in our pipeline.’ Drop: Apple's shares have hit their lowest levels in a year-and-a-half suggesting the company has lost crucial ground to rivals including Samsung . Since Cook  began running the company, . Apple has only launched the iPad mini, which has sold poorly and . whittled down profit margins. Under Jobs, who died in October 2011, . Apple released a series of revolutionary gadgets, from the music-playing . iPod to the iPhone and the iPad. Its products dominated every sphere the company entered, forcing rivals to play catch-up.

The shape of the four foils creates lift, to haul the vessel above the surface of the water and travel with minimal water resistance and in turn very little noise. Scroll down for video . A speedboat will allow holiday makers to 'fly' above water, instead of gliding through it. The Quadrofoil (pictured) uses  hydrofoils to lift the craft out of the water and allow it to reach a top speed of 25mph (40kph) Marine engineers from Slovenia, who invented the craft, described it as ‘a thrilling yet quiet and eco-friendly watercraft’. ‘Its silent motor and zero emissions enable it to ride on lakes, rivers, seas & eco-zones where most motor boats and PWC’s are not allowed. No noise, no waves, no emissions.’ The Quadrofoil has four hydrofoils, which are wing-like lifting surfaces that operate in water. They look like airfoils used by aeroplanes and are mounted on struts below the hull . When speed is gained, they lift the boat's hull out of the water, decreasing drag and allowing greater speeds. The foils are shaped to move smoothly through the water causing water flow to be deflected downward, which exerts an upward force on the foil. This turning of the water causes higher pressure on the bottom and reduced pressure on the top of the foil. This pressure difference is accompanied by a velocity difference, so the resulting flow about the foil has a higher average velocity on one side than the other. When used as a lifting element on a hydrofoil boat, this upward force lifts the body of the vessel, decreasing drag and increasing speed. The shape of the four foils creates lift, to drag the vessel above the surface of the water (pictured) and travel with minimal water resistance . Height: 3ft 11 inches (1.2 metres) Length: 9ft 10 inches (3 metres) Width with foils: 8ft 2 inches (2.5 metres) Weight: 220lbs (100kg) Seats: 2 . Speed: 25mph (40kph) Range: 62 miles (100km) on a full battery . Batteries: 10KWh . Cost: €22,500 (£17,586 or $28,144) Shipping date: March 2015 . The craft costs €22,500 (£17,586 or $28,144) and will be shipped in March next year. It is powered by an electric motor and will cost less than 80p ($1.3) an hour to run. The Quadrofoil is easy to operate, according to its creators and the steering wheel has an integrated touch screen display to show a user how much battery power the boat has left, as well as its range and speed. The battery will give the craft a range of 62miles (100km) on a single charge. The wheel will act as a detachable key, so that no-one else can start the engine when it is removed. The boat has an integrated steering system, which is designed to keep the craft stable, prevents drifting and makes the craft responsive. It is made to be stable and stay horizontal at all times because of the foil design, which places the centre of gravity 26 ft (eight metres) above the vessel. The lightweight hull is built from composite materials and weighs just 220 lbs (100kg). Despite claiming the Quadrofoil is unsinkable and super stable, the craft will come with two life jackets, a paddle and safety whistle. The craft (pictured), which costs £12,000 ($19,200) is powered by an electric motor and costs less than 80p ($1.3) an hour to run. It is designed to be a luxurious recreational vehicle .

"During a White House meeting called to brief America's largest tech companies today about government overreach in electronic surveillance, President Barack Obama changed the subject – angering some meeting participants by shifting gears to address the failed launch of healthcare.gov. 'That wasn't what we came for,' a vice-president of a company whose CEO attended told MailOnline. 'We really didn't care for a PR pitch about how the administration is trying to salvage its internal health care tech nightmare.' One executive said that meeting participants were dead-set against straying from the principal focus of the meeting – the uncomfortable and legally untenable position they are in when the National Security Agency demands access to their digital records. The White House said in advance that the meeting would include a discussion of healthcare.gov, but the company executive said the only subject that mattered to the participants was the NSA. 'He basically hijacked the meeting,' the executive said. 'We all told the White House that we were only there to talk about what the NSA was up to and how it affects us.' All smiles: Obama joked with tech executives before focusing on Obamacare and relegating the companies' NSA concerns to second-tier status . Yet Obama, according to insiders, repeatedly peppered the discussion with reassuring words about how the Affordable Care Act's marquee website was well on its way to becoming functional. The change was so noticeable that an AFP/Getty photographer assigned to cover the event noted in a photo caption only that Obama was there to 'meet with executives from leading tech companies to discuss progress with healthcare.gov.' One executive of a company represented at the meeting told The Guardian that a change of focus 'is not going to happen. We are there to talk about the NSA.' Another said issues other than intelligence agencies' snooping are 'peripheral.' The unnamed business leader told the paper that 'there's only one subject that people really want to discuss right now.' The 15 companies, including Google, Yahoo!, Microsoft, Netflix, Twitter, Apple and Etsy, issued a one-line joint statement after the 150-minute marathon meeting in the White House's Roosevelt Room, saying that they 'appreciated the opportunity to share directly with the president our principles on government surveillance that we released last week and we urge him to move aggressively on reform.' There was no mention in the statement of healthcare.gov. Hands on the table, Joe: Vice President Biden was seated next to one of the meeting's few female participants, Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer. Biden made headlines yesterday for his roving paws at a holiday party . A serious matter: Reporters on Tuesday put White House press secretary Jay Carney on the spot about about a federal judge who declared that the NSA's bulk collection of millions of Americans' telephone records is unconstitutional . But in its statement to reporters about the meeting, the White House played up the significance of focusing portions of the get-together on how to fix the government's disastrous health insurance website. Obama and the executives 'discussed a number of issues ... including the progress being made to improve performance and capacity issues with heathcare.gov,' the statement began. After announcing a changing of the guard in the push to repair the site, the White House noted that '[f]inally, the group discussed the national security and economic impacts of unauthorized intelligence disclosures.' A group of eight tech companies, including some in attendance on Tuesday, asked Obama last week for an overhaul of the surveillance laws that govern the NSA. 'The balance in many countries has tipped too far in favor of the state and away from the rights of the individual – rights that are enshrined in our Constitution,"" they wrote in an open letter to the president. Distraction: Obama took time out from the supposedly NSA-focused meeting to announce that Jeff Zients (L) would be replaced as his healthcare website czar . A federal judge ruled Monday that their concerns about government spy programs are well-founded. U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon declared that the NSA's broad seizures of telecommunications companies' call records violate the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. That provision protects Americans from unreasonable searches. The ruling is already being seen as partial validation for the exiled leaker Edward Snowden, who exposed details of the NSA's huge data collection program to the public this year. 'I have significant doubts about the efficacy of the metadata collection program as a means of conducting time-sensitive investigations in cases involving imminent threats of terrorism,' the judge wrote in his ruling. 'I cannot imagine a more ‘indiscriminate’ and ‘arbitrary invasion’ than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every single citizen for purposes of querying it and analyzing it without judicial approval.' In Tuesday's meeting, Yahoo! CEO Marissa Meyer was seated next to Vice President Joe Biden, whose wandering hands were the subject of nationwide jokes on Monday. The vice president was photographed at a recent holiday party posing with a reporter, who was pictured apparently making sure his grasp didn't stray north of her waist.","'We didn't really care for a PR pitch' about Obamacare, said one executive .

"Almost 25 years since the Iron Curtain came down, deer roaming the Czech-German border still balk at crossing areas where electric fences one lay. A study of the animals in the Sumava national park, in the Czech Republic, has discovered that red deer are avoiding the once perilous areas where three parallel electrified fences were patrolled by armed guards - despite the creatures having no living memory of it. Nearly 500 people died trying to cross the barrier, which isolated the communist world from the West. These red deer near Harrachov, Czech Republic, still fear crossing the line where the Iron Curtain once stood . A reconstruction of the electrified barbed-wire barrier stands in the nearby Sumava National Park. But the original fence was taken down in 1991 - long before the current population of deer were born . According to a seven-year study, the . invisible border has become instilled in the population, and will be . handed down generations. Pavel . Sustr, a biologist who led the project at Czech Republic's Sumava . National Park, said: 'It was fascinating to realize for the first time . that anything like that is possible.' Czechoslovakia, where the communists took power in 1948, had three parallel electrified fences. Many deer were victims of the barrier, which came down in 1991. 'The border still plays a role for them and separates the two populations.' He said the research showed the animals stick to traditional life patterns, returning every year to the same places. 'Fawns follow mothers for the first year of their life and learn from them where to go.' Biologists who conducted a seven-year study into the behaviour predict it will last for generations . Scientists conducting research on German territory reached similar conclusions. Wildlife . officials recorded the movement of some 300 Czech and German deer with . GPS-equipped collars which sent data to computers. 'I . don't think it's a surprising result,' said professor Ludek Bartos of . the Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague, who was not involved in . the research. 'These animals are really conservative.'","Seven-year study found red deer on Czech-German border do not cross .

"Under attack: David Cameron's pledge to hike foreign aid has been opposed by a powerful committee of peers . David Cameron was last night urged to abandon his controversial foreign aid target as a major report warned that it will fuel corruption and waste. A powerful committee of peers attacked the Prime Minister’s pledge to increase aid spending by 37 per cent to more than £12billion a year in order to meet an ‘arbitrary’ United Nations target. Peers said they fully supported humanitarian aid for disaster zones. But they pointed out that it accounts for less than 10 per cent of the vast budget of the Department for International Development (DfID). In a devastating verdict they warned that the rush to increase spending ‘risks reducing the quality, value for money and accountability’ of the aid programme. The finding is a major embarrassment for Mr Cameron who is said, while in opposition, to have adopted the target of spending 0.7 per cent of Britain’s income on aid, partly to help ‘detoxify’ the Conservatives’ image as ‘the Nasty Party’. The cross-party economic affairs committee said ministers seemed more interested in the amount of money they were spending on aid than the results they were achieving. The committee’s chairman, former Tory Cabinet minister Lord MacGregor, said: ‘We were unanimous in our view that legislation for a 0.7 per cent target is inappropriate, and that the Government should reconsider. ‘We believe aid should be judged by the criteria of effectiveness and value for money, not by whether a specific arbitrary target is reached.’ The committee also called on ministers to ‘urgently prepare an early exit strategy’ from Britain’s £1.1billion aid programme for India. Peers said sending hundreds of millions of pounds to a country that can afford its own space programme provided a ‘perverse incentive’ for the Indian government to shirk its own responsibility for tackling poverty in its vast population. They also criticised DfID for failing to do enough to tackle corruption. Peers said they were ‘greatly concerned by the paltry and implausibly low levels of fraud identified by DfID’. They said they had heard ‘compelling evidence... that aid can frequently finance corruption’. Labour peer Baroness Kingsmill said: ‘Almost every witness expressed concerns about corruption. We heard some pretty grim stories. DfID and the Secretary of State need to up their game.’ £1.1billion in aid... India's maiden lunar mission Chandrayaan-1, or Moon Craft in ancient Sanskrit, takes off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in 2008 . Mr Cameron has passionately defended the commitment to the target against angry critics – including many of his own MPs – who say the aid budget should not be spared the axe being taken to public services. He has said the Government will not ‘balance the books on the backs of the poorest people in the world’. But Lord Tugendhat, a Tory member of the committee, said: ‘The debate about not balancing the books on the back of the poor sounds very good but that implies that we are maintaining the budget, not that we are aiming to increase it by 37 per cent. ‘It is very difficult, when you look at what’s happening to other programmes, to justify one programme being increased by 37 per cent.’ The Coalition has pledged to enshrine the aid target in law but legislation has been delayed because of fears of a public backlash. The committee said International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell was unable to ‘put forward any case for legislation other than the Government’s political commitment to it’. The study found the UK already spends a much higher proportion of its income – about 0.55 per cent – on aid than most other countries. The U.S. spends 0.2 per cent. The scale of the opposition raises doubts about whether the legislation will get through the Lords. Mr Mitchell last night hit back, saying that the aid programme was helping to get 11million children into school, vaccinate 55million children and prevent the deaths of 250,000 babies. ‘The Government makes no apologies for sticking to its commitments to the world’s poorest people,’ he said. ‘Going back on this promise would cost lives.’ Billionaire Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who now runs his own charity tackling disease in the developing world, said: ‘Abandoning the 0.7 per cent target risks undermining the incredible progress that has been achieved over the last several years. ‘Well-targeted UK aid has helped save millions of lives by rolling back the malaria and HIV epidemics and bringing the world closer to eradicating polio once and for all.’","Just 10 per cent of DfID budget goes to disaster zones .

"If the infamous It’s a Royal Knockout show is becoming a faded memory, here’s why... Prince Edward turns 50 today. To mark the occasion Buckingham Palace have issued a charming new portrait of the Earl of Wessex, the title he was granted on his marriage, his wife, Sophie, the Countess of Wessex and their two children The Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and James, Viscount Severn. Taken in in the panelled dining room in their Berkshire home, Bagshot Park, by photographer Millie Pilkington, who also took the private photographs at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding, it is a particularly relaxed family portrait. To mark Prince Edward's 50th birthday, Buckingham Palace have issued a charming new portrait of the Earl of Wessex, the title he was granted on his marriage, his wife, Sophie, the Countess of Wessex and their two children The Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and James, Viscount Severn . The Royal couple dressed smartly to celebrate their youngest son's half century birthday . The Queen wore a pearl necklace and matching earrings and a bright red lipstick to go with her cream coat . The Queen and The Duke Of Edinburgh arrive at Bagshot Park, Surrey for Prince Edwards 50th .

His . daughter, ten, wearing a grey pinafore and white jumper clutches his . arm affectionately, while his wife of almost 15 years, Sophie, smiles . broadly as she crouches behind. Aside . from the release of the official portrait, the prince has determinedly . refused to make a big deal of out his landmark birthday, granting a . single interview to a children’s news programme. He . will, however, conduct two public engagements with his wife in support . of the Wessex Youth Trust, the charity the couple set up shortly before . their marriage in 1999. The couple will then accompany the Queen and other senior royals to the Commonwealth Observance Service at Westminster Abbey. In . recent years Edward, often cited as the Queen’s favoured son, has . become something of the quiet man of the British monarchy, conducting . 258 engagements last year with little fanfare. He . is also considered the successor to his father’s Duke of Edinburgh . Awards scheme and been handed the plum role of International Trustee and . Chairman of the International Council. This has resulted in him becoming one of the most well-travelled members of the royal family last year. In . 2013 he conducted 87 engagement overseas, bettered only by his wife - . who carried out 95 - and Prince Charles, who also clocked up 95 jobs but . undertook two lengthy foreign tours on behalf of the British . government.

"This horrific video shows a police officer flogging a cowering woman in the street as a crowd watches without protesting or intervening. The crime that prompted this horrendous assault? She had ridden in a car with a man who she wasn't related to, an offense that is prohibited by Sudan’s public order law. The video is believed to have been taken in Khartoum, the capital, and shows the terrified and bewildered woman crying out in pain as lash after vicious lash rains down.Scroll down for video . A Sudanese woman was filmed being whipped by a police officer for riding in a car with a man she wasn't related to . The woman, reportedly named Halima, cowers on the ground and tries to cover her head with a pink veil while a police officer stalks back and forth, before lining up a vicious swipe. In the video, the police officer warns the woman: 'This is so you don’t get into cars anymore.' Meanwhile a crowd of onlookers mutely stands and watches the disturbing spectacle. The video was anonymously sent to a journalist, who uploaded it last month. The accents of the people in the video point to it being filmed around Khartoum. Mute witness: The crowd watches silently as the blows rain down on the terrified woman . Khartoum’s governor, Abdul Rahman Al Khidir, reportedly said that he didn’t think the flogging was properly carried out, but still thought the woman was 'rightfully punished according to the Shar’ia law,' according to the New York Daily News. Shar’ia law, a system of Islamic religious laws, is widely interpreted by Muslim communities around the world. According to Think Africa Press, the . women of Sudan have been suffering under article 152 of the penal code, . an 'inhumane, vicious and notorious' law first implemented in 1991. The woman attempted to cover her face with her pink veil during the attack . Menacing: The guard paces back and forth between blows . In the video, the police officer warns the woman: 'This is so you don't get into cars anymore.' Article . 152 of Sudan’s criminal code stipulates that any conduct or clothing in . violation of public decency be punished with 40 lashes. The law, which . mainly targets women, is vague as to what constitutes indecent clothing, . leaving room for the Public Order Police to arrest whoever they deem to . be dressed inappropriately or committing an act of indecency.

"Sarah Palin's oldest son, Track, is getting divorced just 18 months after tying the knot, in another blow to the family values advocate. The 23-year-old and his wife, Britta, 22, married in May, 2011, and just three months later, Britta gave birth to a little girl, Kyla. But the pair filed for divorce in an Alaskan court this week, according to TMZ. The news of Track's marriage breakdown comes after his sister Bristol's very public relationship dramas. Divorcing: Track Palin, centre right, and Britta Hanson, centre left, married in May 2011, on the slope in Alaska . Bristol, who famously got pregnant in . 2008 at age 18, was twice engaged to high school boyfriend Levi . Johnston, but broke it off both times. Under Alaska law, by filing for divorce together, Track and Britta are signaling they have fully settled property and custody issues, including child support of Kyla, who is now 15 months old. According to TMZ, the agreement requires . Track and Britta to watch a 48-minute video showing them how to explain . the breakup of the family to their child. Britta's mother, Mary Hanson, confirmed Britta and Track were . separated. She told MailOnline: 'They’re not divorced, but they are separated. Pregnancy: Britta, pictured, gave birth to daughter Kyla three months after the wedding . Happy: The couple seemed happy about the birth of their child, though things obviously went downhill . 'They're both very private and all I can say is that . they're concentrating on working to be the best parents they can be to their . daughter.' Abstinence . preacher Sarah Palin claimed she couldn't be happier when the high . school sweethearts wed in a ski slope ceremony last May. Delighted: At the wedding, Sarah Palin, pictured, said the families looked forward to the couple's long life together . In a joint statement with Britta's parents, Ms Hanson and and Reverend Duane Hanson, the Palin's said they looked forward to the couple's 'blessed' life together, but didn't mention the pregnancy. 'Our families couldn't be . happier! These are two hard working, humble, active, studious young . adults who grew up together,' the parents said. 'We're tickled that after two decades . of friendship we proudly witnessed their marriage, knowing their new . life together will be blessed.' After Kyla's birth, Britta's mother expressed her delight over her first grandchild, telling RadarOnline the little girl was 'great.' 'She’s beautiful. I’m very happy,' she said. 'I love my daughter and my son-in-law very much.' It's unclear what led to the couple's marriage unraveling. Kyla Grace is the second of Palin's . grandchildren after her daughter Bristol gave birth to a boy Tripp, in 2008. Palin has famously advocated that schools teach . teenagers to abstain from sex before marriage and became an even stronger advocate after her daughter's unintended pregnancy. Pictures of an excited Britta before the couple's daughter was born suggested they were happy about the impending birth. Split: Bristol Palin, Levi Johnston and their son Tripp - Sarah Palin's first grandchild - pictured in July, 2010 before their break-up . One photo captioned 'my beautiful . britta pie!' taken after a baby shower, shows . the expectant mother smiling brightly and surrounded by gifts. Another, posted on a Wasilla woman's Facebook wall, shows Britta holding up a small hoodie as she smiles at the camera. Track became the first Palin child to get married when the couple wed last May. He spent a year with the Army in . Iraq as a reservist before the wedding. Britta, the daughter of a . minister, studied nursing at the University of Alaska. Track's love story seemed to be much happier than that of Sarah Palin's daughter Bristol, who was twice engaged to high school boyfriend Levi Johnston, but broke it off both times. However, it appears that wasn't the case.","Couple wed in May 2011 on a mountain in Alaska .

"Texting while driving can be incredibly dangerous and in most countries it is completely outlawed. That doesn’t stop some thoughtless motorists from trying to compose a message while flying along a motorway, though, increasing the chance of a fatal accident. But now one company claims to have developed a ‘texting gun’ that can recognise the frequency of a text message, allowing police to fine people for doing it. Scroll down for video . A company in Virginia has designed a device to detect drivers who text. The Sniffer Sleuth II (shown), made by ComSonics, can apparently discern if a phone is being used to make a call, data transfer or text. This is useful for countries where the law on phone usage is complicated . In the UK it is illegal to use your phone at all when driving, while the law varies in the US from state to state - most allow phone calls but no texting. Drivers caught using a phone in the UK can be charged up to £1,000 ($1,640) and also lose their license - although hands-free kits and sat navs are allowed. These inconsistencies can make it difficult for police to work out if a person is being distracted by their phone or not. This led to Virginia-based ComSonics to design a gun that can detect frequencies. Using an Apple Watch while driving could put you in prison for up to two years, motoring experts have warned. When the gadget is released next year, it will allow users to make and receive calls, check their messages and monitor their health by operating the device on their wrists. But people who use Apple Watch while on the road are at risk of causing fatal crashes and will face the same penalties as those caught on their mobile phones. This is according to the London-based Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) who has warned that smartwatches will 'significantly' impair driving performance. Existing research by the IAM on smartphone use between 2006 and 2010 found distraction from a mobile phone was a contributory factor in 1,960 road accidents, 110 of which were fatal. The device, called the Sniffer Sleuth II, is currently in production although no release date or price has been announced yet. According to the Virginian-Pilot, it can discern the different frequencies from a text message, phone call and data transfer. It apparently uses similar technology used by cable repairmen to find where a cable is damaged, who look for transmission ‘leaks’. For states like Virginia where talking on the phone while driving is legal but texting is not, this could be especially useful. In addition, the device can apparently even work out which person in the car is texting, so it will not alert police to issue a fine if it spots frequencies from a passenger. The device has yet to be given legislative approval amid some privacy concerns, but Malcolm MacIntyre of ComSonics told the Virginian-Pilot it was ‘close to production.’ When reached for further comment on these privacy concerns and also how accurate the device is in discerning signals, ComSonics was yet to respond.

"Law enforcement officials in Maryland are on the hunt for a murder suspect who was released by mistake from jail while waiting to go on trial. Rodriquez Purnell, 30, was erroneously freed Friday from the Maryland Reception, Diagnostic and Classification Center in Baltimore, and he has not been seen since. Purnell was awaiting trial in the shooting death of 27-year-old Terrance J Rheubottom on St. Patrick's Day 2013 in Baltimore. He also had been convicted of assaulting a corrections worker. Wanted man: Murder suspect Rodriquez Purnell, 30, was accidentally released from a Baltimore jail Friday, and he has not been seen since . Slipped through the cracks: Purnell was awaiting trial at the Maryland Reception, Diagnostic and Classification Center in Baltimore (pictured) Corrections officials did not release details of how Purnell was released but said they did not realize their error until they got a tip Sunday night from the victim's family, who said that friends had spotted the murder suspect in his old neighborhood. Del. John Cluster, a Baltimore County Republican and former police officer, on Tuesday questioned why corrections officials didn't realize Purnell had been freed earlier, noting that prison protocol is to conduct a nightly head count of all inmates. ‘If this is done nightly, how could such a dangerous person not come up missing immediately?’ Cluster said. The Maryland Department of Public Safety and Corrections acknowledged in a statement Tuesday afternoon that a breach in protocol led to the accidental release. Victim: Purnell is accused of shooting dead TJ Rheubottom, a father of two, in March 2013 . According to corrections officials, staff members are required to perform multiple checks on inmates before they are released. In Purnell’s case, he was let go because procedures were not followed. The department said it would conduct its own investigation into the matter. For now, an employee linked to the protocol breach has been placed on paid administrative leave. But Cluster said the Maryland State Police should investigate how Purnell came to be freed and determine if criminal charges are appropriate, including against administrative officials. He said the prison costs about $39million in taxpayer money to run every year, and that since it's under control of the state, the state is responsible for anything Purnell might do while he's out of prison. Purnell is accused of shooting dead Terrence Jerome Rheubottom, a father of two, inside a car on Ruxton Avenue in Baltimore on March 17, 2013. Jacqueline Davis, Rheubottom's mother, said that whoever is responsible for Purnell's release needs to be fired and that Purnell needs to be found. ‘I just want him back in custody,’ she said. ‘I want to see him convicted and behind bars.’ Distraught: Jacqueline Davis (left), the mother of TJ Rheubottom (right), expressed concern that her son's suspected killer  may try to harm her family or intimidate witnesses . Speaking to the station WBAL-TV, Mrs Davis expressed concern for the safety of her family, as well as for people whom may have witnessed her son's slaying. 'He could be anywhere out there, calling the witnesses, trying to intimidate them,' she said. TJ Rheubottom's mother pleaded for Purnell to turn himself in. Purnell's trial is scheduled to get under way November 19. He is described as a black male, 6 feet tall and weighing 175lbs, with black hair and brown eyes.","Rodriguez Purnell, 30, was let go by mistake from Maryland Reception, Diagnostic and Classification Center Friday .

"US security chiefs have issued a warning that terrorists could be smuggling explosives on to flights bound for Russia by hiding them inside toothpaste tubes. The Department of Homeland Security issued a warning to American airlines, saying terrorists were determined to strike during the Sochi Winter Games. New intelligence indicates that toothpaste containers could hold ingredients used to make a bomb. Scroll down for video . New threat: Homeland Security warned airlines today that toothpaste bottles could contain ingredients to make a bomb, and that the new threat was directed at flights bound for Russia in time for the Olympic games . While the department focuses on domestic threats, they say the most recent tip is not directed at flights entering the United States - just Russian bound flights. 'Out of an abundance of caution, [Department of Homeland Security] regularly shares relevant information with domestic and international partners, including those associated with international events such as the Sochi Olympics,' DHS said in a statement. 'While we are not aware of a specific threat to the homeland at this time, this routine communication is an important part of our commitment to making sure we meet that priority.' Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who ran the Salt Lake City games in 2002, responded to the latest threat on CNN, saying he would still attend the games if he could. Kerry says he's too busy to go, but if he could he wouldn't feel uncomfortable bringing his family. The Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia have been the target of several terrorist threats in the months leading up to the games. Perhaps one of the biggest threats is the so-called 'Black Widow' - a Chechen woman named Ruzan Ibragimova, the wife of a killed Islamist militant, whom Russian authorities fear infiltrated the Olympic city before security was put up to carry out an attack. Real threat: Russian authorities believe Ruzan Ibragimov, also known as the Black Widow, has infiltrated the Olympic city and plans to carry out an attack during the games . Posters with her face have been plastered all across the city on the Black Sea, but she has yet to be found. The threat of the Black Widow and Russian authorities refusing the help of U.S. intelligence has led the government to issue a warning to Americans traveling to the games, saying a terrorist attack is 'very likely'. Multiple U.S. lawmakers have spoke about the threats, saying they don't believe the games are safe and wouldn't take their families. 'I would not go and I don’t think I would send my family,' Senator Angus King of Maine told CNN. Security fears: The Sochi Games has been the target of several terrorist threats in recent months . President Obama won't be attending the games, but he said he wouldn't discourage Americans from attending to support their country. 'I believe that Sochi is safe and that there are always some risks in these large international gatherings. I'm always going to feel even better if it's inside the United States because then we have full control over what happens,' the president said. Secretary of State John Kerry issued a similar sentiment on CNN Wednesday, saying Americans can go to the games but should remain alert if they do. 'We feel that everything has been done that can be done to try to guarantee people's safety and security... Be careful. Think about where you are, just as we did, always, in America post-9/11,' Kerry said.","The new threat is aimed at flights bound for Russia during the Winter Olympics .

"Packets of cigarettes are not the first place people today would look for health and safety tips. But as these cards show, smokers were given bizarre lifehacks when they lit up. Among the tips contained in the cartons are practical pieces of advice that are still useful today, such as lighting a match in the wind or removing splinters. Handy tip: The Ogden Cigarette card advises people to use a 'scout's staff, a walking stick or even a handkerchief or hat' to distract the rabid dog to make time to give it a 'disabling kick' Age-old problem: Gallaher's Cigarettes say smokers can overcome the problem of lighting a match in the wind by cutting thin shavings towards the end which make the 'flame stronger' and give it a 'better chance' Sage advice: For those who need advice on chopping down trees from a cigarette card, Gallaher's gives a diagram on how to do so (left) and A tip for people wanting to survive while they go on holiday involves plaiting wool and leaving one end in a pail of water and the other in the soil . However, other nuggets are less likely to resonate with people today. They include advice on how to battle a mad dog, rescue someone who has touched a 'live . wire' and chop down tree. These 'How-To' series were published by Gallaher Ltd of Belfast and London and Ogden's Branch of the Imperial Tobacco Co in the 1910s. Hints for customers include using the end of a pole or a 'Scout's staff' to distract a rabid dog and give someone enough time to launch a 'disabling kick'. Smokers could also turn to the cigarette card for information on how to cut down a tree and rescuing someone who has touched a 'live wire'. The card advises people to stand on glass or dry wood and not to touch them with bare hands before calling for a doctor. Helping hand: To rescue someone who has touched a 'live wire', Gallaher's wisely advises people not to touch them unless they are wearing rubber gloves but to stand on 'glass or dry wood' and try to switch off the current until the doctor arrives, while adventurous types should get 'a boy' to swim a tree-tied rope to the other side of a river and then 'fasten a seat to a running loop or a block pulley' to pass poor swimmers over water . Useful: Preserve freshly laid eggs by burying them in dry salt but ensure 'no air whatever to get to the shell' Other tips were for everyday concerns. Before the electric refrigerator became common, Gallaher's Cigarettes told smokers to preserve eggs by burying them in dry salt. Annoying splinters could also be removed by steaming the flesh over hot water. The perennial problem of lighting a match in the wind is also solved for card holders. They are advised to cut thin shavings towards the striking end to help the flame catch.

"Tragic: Ashley Anne Riggitano, 22, leapt from a New York bridge . The best friend and business partner of a budding fashionista who jumped to her death from a New York bridge on what was supposed to be her 22nd birthday posted a Facebook rant allegedly targeting the young woman just hours before the suicide. Ashley Anne Riggitano leapt from George Washington Bridge at 4.40pm yesterday into the Hudson River. It is believed that earlier in the day, Victoria Van Thunen, who co-owned the jewelry line Missfits with Riggitano, wrote on her Facebook . page: ‘Those who incessantly blame others as the cause of . their issues should perhaps take a step back and reevaluate these . situations. The common thread may be that “they” aren’t the problem, but . rather that YOU are.’ Riggitano's Louis Vuitton bag left on the bridge contained handwritten notes singling out the five people who had made her unhappy, who whom she did not want at her funeral. 'All my other ‘friends’ are in it for gossip,' she wrote according to the New York Post. It remains unknown if Van Thunen was among the friends mentioned in Riggitano's grudge list. Calls to her cell phone were no immediately  answered Thursday evening. Riggitano also mentioned a man who she was not happy with, and although he was . permitted to attend her funeral, she added that she hoped he 'gets what . he deserves' when he gets there. The newspaper reported that Miss Riggitano may have had a history of problems and tried to commit suicide at least once before. Medication, including Adderall and Klonopin, was found in her bag, according to sources. Adderall . is used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder . or narcolepsy, while Klonopin  is used to control seizures in epilepsy . and for the treatment of panic disorder. Business: Ashley Riggitano and Victoria Van Thunen launched their business in May 2011 . The newspaper reported that the people referred to in the notes appeared to be friends from college or work and that Miss Riggitano may have been bullied by her fashion friends. Miss Riggitano had been working as  intern for the New York-based jewelry and fashion designer Alex Woo. In a phone interview with MailOnline Thursday, Woo, who employed Riggitano as a part-time intern, said everyone in the company was stunned by the news of her suicide. ‘She always had a smile on her face,’ she didn’t look depressed,’ Miss Woo said. According to the jewelry designer, Riggitano began working for the company on a part-time basis in January, and was only at work about two days a week. Woo said her goal was to learn about the fashion business. Couture girl: Alison Riggitano's employer said the 22-year-old intern appeared very put together and had a distinct New York city style . Popular: Alex Woo said the fashion community embraced Riggitano for her sharp sense of style, and everyone were nice to her . Tell-tale sign? Riggitano was invited to a major trade show in January as part of Alex Woo's team, but called in sick and missed the event . Woo recalled that early last month, Riggitano was supposed to take part on a major trade show that the design house was participating in, but called in sick. A short time later, she took another sick day. Woo added that the vivacious the 22-year-old had a distinct New York City style and always appeared put together, which made others in the fashion community embrace her as one of their own. ‘I think everybody were really sweet to her,’ she said. ‘She didn’t look like she was the kind of person who was bullied at all.’ The designer went on to say that in the short time that Riggitano had spent at the company, she always came in on time, and was happy to chat about television shows she had watched or the blogs she had read. ‘It was a really big shock to us,’ Woo said, referring to Riggitano's tragic end. According to the site Cliffview Pilot, what makes the suicide even more tragic is the fact that Riggitano took her life on what was supposed to be her 22nd birthday. Death: Miss Riggitano leapt from George Washington Bridge at 4:40 p.m. yesterday into the Hudson River . The 22-year-old started her own . business, called .

"A huge shoal of sardines surrounded unsuspecting diver in seas off the Philippines allowing them to capture amazing picture of a breathtaking natural phenomenon. The shoal was captured on camera by Nadya Kulagina on the last dive of her trip off the coast of the small Pescador Island which is close to Cebu in centre of the South East Asian country. The magnificent spectacle, known as a sardine run, sees the silver fish swimming in tight formation to create a . shimmering wall of fish during their annual migration to warmer waters. Breathtaking: The huge schoal of sardines surrounds a diver as the fish swirl through the water in their thousands near Pescador Island in the Philippines . The run happens in the region from May through to July when billions of sardines spawn in the cool waters of southern Africa and move north along the east coast and into the Indian Ocean. Ms Kulagina, who is from Kazakhstan, said: 'We were exploring the abundance of marine life - frog fish, moray eels, octopi, sea snakes when suddenly the sky grew dark as if overcast with unexpected clouds. 'I looked up and there were thousands, no millions of sardines moving as one organism. Their moving mass was blocking the sun turning day into night. It was so mesmerising that everyone froze to watch the monster in action.'

'I was trying hard not to lose sense of direction. It also kept changing shapes, one minute it would open wide and the next shrink into a tight ball.' The sardine run is happens when the fish migrate to a better breeding ground with more food such as plankton.

"Saudi Arabia will likely see the United States surpass it as the biggest liquid petroleum producer in the world, it has been reported. The change may happen this week, according to The Times, which pointed out that the shift would end Saudi Arabia's twenty-year streak as the biggest producer. The United States now produces nearly 12million barrels each day, as opposed to 8million barrels three years ago, the newspaper reported. On Monday, the head of the west's energy watchdog said the vast majority of shale oil in the United States is produced at costs far below the current price of crude, which means U.S. projects can withstand the market slump squeezing other producers. Growth: The United States now produces nearly 12million barrels each day, as opposed to 8million barrels three years ago (file photo) Brent oil stands at around $88 per barrel, down more than 23 percent from the year's peak above $115 in June, raising concern that some shale oil projects will become un-economic. However Maria van der Hoeven, executive director of the International Energy Agency said that only a tiny minority of shale oil production would be affected by the slump in prices to near-four-year lows. 'Some 98 percent of crude oil and condensates from the United States have a breakeven price of below $80 and 82 percent had a breakeven price of $60 or lower,' she told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the launch of the Africa Energy Outlook publication. Saudi Arabia is quietly telling oil market participants that Riyadh is comfortable with markedly lower oil prices for an extended period, a sharp shift in policy that may be aimed at slowing the expansion of rival producers including those in the U.S. shale patch. Strategy: Saudi Arabia is quietly telling oil market participants that Riyadh is comfortable with  lower oil prices, perhaps meant to help slow the expansion of rival producers including those in the U.S. shale patch (file photo) Some OPEC members are clamoring for urgent output cuts to push global prices back up above $100 a barrel as they rely heavily on oil exports to balance their budgets, but others like the Saudis are thought to be more relaxed. Van der Hoeven said the fall in the oil price would provide a welcome economic boost for economies which are heavily reliant on oil imports. 'We've noted more than once in the past years the relatively high price of oil really places a burden on oil consumers. What we see now with these much lower prices, for consumers it will be a welcome relief.' However she added that it could make life more difficult for exporters who rely on income from oil sales. 'It's a benefit for the global economy but it might have some consequences,' she said. 'The recent price drop will present some challenges for those producers who base budget assumptions on oil prices above $100 per barrel.' The IEA's monthly Oil Market Report, which will give further insight into the agency's analysis of the current demand outlook is due out on Tuesday.","Saudi Arabia will likely see the United States surpass it as the biggest liquid petroleum producer in the world .

"These starkly-beautiful images bring to light the subterranean conditions endured by soldiers of the First World War while they were sheltering from constant artillery fire. Even though the fear of death always hung over the men - or perhaps because of it - the soft stone of the carved-out walls are covered in personal expressions of identity and survival. The stills were taken by Texan photographer Jeff Gusky, who chronicled the tunnels in France alongside National Geographic writer Evan Hadingham. Mr Hadingham wrote: 'The entrance is a wet hole in the earth little bigger than an animal burrow, obscured by thorny brush in a secluded wood in northeastern France. Together we slither through the muddy hole into the darkness below. 'After a few hundred feet the tunnel ends at a little cubicle hewed out of the chalk, reminiscent of a telephone booth.' Scroll down for video . U.S. troops of the 26th 'Yankee' Division, billeted in an underground quarry at Chemin des Dames, carved some 500 engravings during six weeks in 1918. These include names, addresses, religious and patriotic symbols, and other images. Abandoned: Some quarries could shelter thousands of men and featured amenities such as electric light. By 1918 combined tank, artillery, and air attacks made battlefields more mobile, and armies began to abandon their underground redoubts. He added: 'Here, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War, German military engineers would take turns sitting in total silence, listening intently for the slightest sound of enemy tunnelers. Muffled voices or the scraping of shovels meant that a hostile mining team might be only yards away, digging an attack tunnel straight toward you. 'The danger grew if the digging stopped and you heard the sound of bags or cans being quietly stacked, one on top of another. It signaled that the enemy was laying high explosives at the end of the tunnel. Most nerve-racking of all was the silence that followed. 'At any moment the charges might detonate and blow you apart or bury you alive.' Even a single small mine could wreak havoc. In one tunnel complex the men visited, a charge set off by the Germans on January 26, 1915, killed 26 French infantrymen and wounded 22 more. The pair found graffiti left by the German engineers who manned this listening post, with names and regiments and a motto: 'Gott für Kaiser!' (God for the Kaiser!). The scars of artillery barrages still pockmark the ruins of a fort at Chemin des Dames, where some 30,000 French troops died during ten days in April 1917. Underground, French and German forces tried to penetrate each other¿s tunnels, and sometimes they fought hand to hand in pitch-black passageways . The deadlock of trench warfare led both sides to tunnel beneath enemy positions and plant explosives. In the Oise Valley, German engineers dug this secret network of tunnels beneath the French front lines. On January 26, 1915, they detonated a charge that killed 26 French infantrymen and wounded 22 . Soldiers relieved the tedium of underground life with signatures, sketches and caricatures, carvings, and even intricate relief sculptures. Life in the quarries was vastly preferable to the muddy hell of the trenches above. A journalist visiting one of the caverns in 1915 noted that 'a dry shelter, straw, some furniture, a fire, are great luxuries for those returning from the trenches.' But conditions were still grim. One French soldier wrote home: 'Vermin devour us, and it’s teeming with lice, fleas, rats and mice. What’s more, it’s very humid and a lot of the men fall sick.' To pass the time, the exhausted men would daydream. Images of women proliferate on the quarry walls, including many sentimental and idealised portraits. Troops left the relative comfort of an underground quarry via a carved stairway leading up to the trenches. Faith: A hundred years ago in a subterranean chapel, an unknown artist carved this image of a French soldier praying. Artwork covers many abandoned passages under the western front . Among the most prolific decorators of the underground cities was the 26th 'Yankee' Division, one of the first U.S. units to reach the front following America’s entry into the war in April 1917. To visit the quarry where they were billeted at Chemin des Dames, Hadingham and Gusky climb down two wobbly ladders into a cavern 30 feet below. They spent hours exploring a hundred-acre complex, finding passageways strewn with countless bottles, shoes, shell cases, helmets, beds made of rusted chicken wire, even an entire cooking range with pots and pans still in place. The images are from a feature - The Hidden world Of The Great War - in the August issue of National Geographic magazine.

"Apple's updated policy means apps on the App Store (pictured) may soon accept approved virtual currencies, as long as they comply with the law . Apple's latest policy changes mean lives in Candy Crush, or the next Flappy Bird, could soon be be bought using Bitcoin. Until now, the tech giant has rejected or removed any apps that allowed the use of virtual currency. But the latest update to the App Store Review Guidelines reveals a change of heart. The policy now claims: ‘Apps may facilitate transmission of approved virtual currencies provided that they do so in compliance with all state and federal laws for the territories in which the app functions.’ This means Bitcoin could be used for downloads or in-app purchases from the Apple App Store. Alternatively, it could mean iPhones will be used to store the currency in virtual wallets. Google's Android platform already accepts the digital money. Jay Karsandas, Digital Manager at Mobiles.co.uk, said: ‘The action that Apple has taken in allowing apps to transmit approved virtual currencies seems like the next natural step in adapting to the ever-growing prominence of cyber-cash systems, such as Bitcoin. ‘We are doubtful that Apple will open the door to Bitcoin mining or significant sums passing through apps; more likely this will be an opportunity for iOS devices to act as Bitcoin wallets for use in online purchases, similar to what the Google Play store already offers.’ Virtual currencies are built around shared software, with users carrying out transactions directly with one another, without having to go through a bank or other company. Users create, or 'mine', new coins by taking part in mathematical operations within the system using cryptography. As a result, Bitcoin is more accurately known as a cryptocurrency. Bitcoin (pictured) could soon be used for downloads or in-app purchases from the Apple App Store and iPhones could be used to store the currency in virtual wallets . In recent months, the value of Bitcoin has fluctuated dramatically. The value of single coins briefly surpassed $1,000 (£600) at the end of last year before plummeting to $350 (£209) in April. The price of Bitcoin now ranges between $650 (£388) and $670 (£400) (pictured) Bitcoin is a piece of data confined to an internet network by an algorithm. Once released it can be traded and used like money online and can be purchased with real cash. Many websites are now taking Bitcoins as a form of currency. As well as digital currency, Bitcoin miners enjoy the competitive nature of unlocking the coins. It has been dismissed by some as a Ponzi Scheme and touted by others as the future of money. It . is not centrally controlled and its unique and complex set-up means the . market cannot be altered or hacked, according to the developers. There . are 21 million coins predicted to last until 2140 and their finite . nature means they perform more like a commodity, such as gold.

"Twelve people died today during the bloodiest day yet of protests in Afghanistan over the burning of Koran copies found in a rubbish pit at a NATO military base. Back in the U.S., GOP presidential candidate Newt Gingrich lashed out at President Barack Obama for saying sorry after copies of the Muslim holy book were found burned earlier this week.

Anger: Afghans shout slogans during a protest against the Koran burning in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Friday . Hundreds of Afghans marched toward the palace of their country’s President Hamid Karzai in Kabul on Friday, while on the other side of the capital protesters hoisted the white flag of the Taliban. Chanting ‘Death to America!’ and ‘Long live Islam!’, protesters also threw rocks at police in Kabul, while Afghan army helicopters circled above and mosques in the capital drew large crowds. Armed protesters took refuge in shops in the eastern part of the city, where one was killed, police said. In another Kabul rally, police were unsure who fired the shots that killed a second protester. Seven more protesters were killed in Herat, two in Khost and one in the relatively peaceful Baghlan province, health and local officials said. In Herat, around 500 men charged at the U.S. consulate. President Obama's apology was announced on Thursday and a few hours later it was reported that an Afghan soldier killed two U.S. troops and wounded others in retaliation for the Koran burning.

To Afghanistan's west, Iranian cleric Ahmad Khatami told state radio that the U.S. purposely burned the Korans. ‘These apologies are fake,’ he said. ‘The world should know America is against Islam.’ ‘It (the Koran burning) was not a mistake,’ he added. ‘It was an intentional move, done on purpose.’ Keep back: Afghan police try to restrain demonstrators during an anti-U.S. protest in Baghlan province .

"U.S. President Barack Obama refused to answer questions about the beleaguered Obamacare website as he walked to church with this family this morning. The Obamas attended the 11am service at St. John's Church Lafayette Square, an Episcopal congregation, about a block from the White House, The Hill reported. When a reporter asked if the . troubled Healthcare.gov website will be fixed by November 30, Obama responded: 'C'mon guys, I'm going to church'. Family outing: The Obamas attended mass at St John's Church in Washington, DC on Sunday . Obama is not an overtly religious man. He and his family rarely attend church, and he almost never elaborates in public about his own relationship to his Christian faith. But far away from the public eye, his longtime advisers say, the president has carefully nurtured a sense of spirituality that has served as a grounding mechanism during turbulent times, when the obstacles to governing a deeply divided nation seem nearly insurmountable. Every year on August 4, the president's birthday, Obama convenes a group of pastors by phone to receive their prayers for him for the year to come. During the most challenging of times, prayer circles are organized with prominent religious figures such as megachurch pastor Joel Hunter, Bishop Vashti McKenzie of the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the Reverend Joseph Lowery, a civil rights activist. Devout: The Obamas farewell Reverend Luis Leon, center, after service at Saint John's Church in Washington on Sunday . And each morning for the past five . years, before most of his aides even arrive at the White House, Obama . has read a devotional written for him and sent to his BlackBerry, . weaving together biblical scripture with reflections from literary . figures like Maya Angelou and C.S. Lewis. 'I've . certainly seen the president's faith grow in his time in office,' said . Joshua DuBois, an informal spiritual adviser to Obama who writes the . devotionals and ran Obama's faith-based office until earlier this year. 'When you cultivate your faith, it grows.' Obama . is particularly moved by theories that draw connections between . biblical themes and the personal journeys of historical figures like . Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr., DuBois said. He added that . the president's spiritual strength is his belief that God will carry him . through to see another day — even amid crises like the . debt-and-spending debacle that's ensnared Washington for the last month. 'Because . of these grounding aspects of his life, he doesn't let the day-to-day . challenges really shake him,' said DuBois, a former associate pastor at a . Pentecostal church. Spiritual guide: Joshua DuBois is President Barack Obama's 'Pastor-in-Chief' The image of Obama as someone who draws heavily on faith to guide his daily life contrasts with his public persona. An . intensely private person, Obama has shied away from all but the most . general descriptions of his spiritual life. After all, Obama had to . distance himself from his longtime pastor, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, . when his anti-American rantings threatened Obama's 2008 presidential . campaign. And persistent, false claims that Obama is secretly a Muslim . have followed him even into his second term. 'Sometimes . I search scripture to determine how best to balance life as a president . and as a husband and as a father,' Obama said in February at the . National Prayer Breakfast. 'I often search for scripture to figure out . how I can be a better man as well as a better president.' The . best clues to which texts fortify Obama's spiritual consumption may . come from the daily devotionals that DuBois started sending Obama, then a . U.S. senator, in 2008. DuBois ran religious outreach for Obama's . presidential campaign that year, and his digital benedictions for Obama . have been compiled in a forthcoming book, 'The President's Devotional'. 'A snippet of scripture for me to reflect on,' Obama has said. 'And it has meant the world to me.' At . pivotal moments in Obama's presidency, DuBois sometimes selects texts . that offer lessons apropos of the challenges at hand. Before one State . of the Union address, it was the words of Isaiah, in an appeal for . clarity of speech: 'So shall my word be that goes out from my mouth, it . shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I . purpose.' Faithful: The Obamas, flanked by their security detail, walk from the White House to St. John's Church for Sunday services in Washington . Others are intended as an oasis from the worldly conflicts Obama has to weather on any given day. 'We . are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed. Perplexed, but not in . despair,' reads a verse from 2 Corinthians that DuBois sent Obama one . November, followed with his own meditation: 'Dear God, give us a . resilient spirit, a spirit that returns to face this day even in the . shadow of yesterday's challenges. Help us, today, to bounce back.' In . his final years in office, Obama plans to continue with the morning . meditations, the birthday call with pastors and ad hoc prayer circles, . said a senior administration official, who wasn't authorized to comment . by name on Obama's spiritual life and requested anonymity. Privately, . Obama also speaks to staff of being mindful of his own spiritual . responsibility to the nation, the official said. In times of crisis, . from devastating hurricanes to tragic school shootings, many Americans . look to their president as a source of strength and comfort.

"Family secret: Guenther Quandt, whose family now owns BMW, used slave labourers during World War Two in his weapons factories in Germany . The dynasty behind the BMW luxury car marker has admitted, after decades of silence, using slave labour, taking over Jewish firms and doing business with the highest echelons of the Nazi party during World War Two. Gabriele Quandt, whose grandfather Guenther employed an estimated 50,000 forced labourers in his arms factories, producing ammunition, rifles, artillery and U-boat batteries, said it was 'wrong' for the family to ignore this chapter of its history. He spoke out after an in-depth study by Bonn-based historian Joachim Scholtyseck, commissioned by the family, that concluded Guenther Quandt and his son Herbert were responsible for numerous Nazi injustices. It found Guenther acquired companies through the Nazi programme of 'Aryanisation' of Jewish-owned firms. Herbert Quandt was 'part of the system', son Stefan Quandt said after the conclusion of the three-year study - forced on the family by public outrage over a German TV documentary - compiled using company files from the 12-year period of the Third Reich. The Quandt family bought into BMW 15 years after the War. The study shows Guenther became a Nazi Party member on May 1, 1933, a month after Adolf Hitler achieved supreme power in Germany. But he had long used a network of party officials and Wehrmacht officers to build up contacts for lucrative state contracts. Married to Magda Behrend Rietschel, Guenther was divorced by her in 1929 although they remained on friendly terms. She went on to marry the 'poison dwarf' of the Nazi party, the propaganda maestro Joseph Goebbels, and would die with him - after murdering their six children - in Hitler's bunker in 1945. The company grew rich in the Nazi era. In 1937, Hitler bestowed on Guenther the title Wehrwirtschaftsführer - leader of the armament economy - and his business supplied weapons using slave labourers from concentration camps in at least three factories. Family ties: Herbert Quandt, Guenther's son, was also aware that slave labour was being used in the family's factories. Right, Adolf Hitler and his propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. Guenther Quandt divorced Magda Behrend Rietschel, who went on to become Goebbels' wife (pictured right) Hundreds of these labourers died. An . execution area to murder those who displeased their masters was found . in one of his plants in Hannover and the study mentions the fate of a . Polish man who was hanged at another plant in front of 50 other inmates. The . study showed that the Quandt firms also used Russian POWs as slave . labourers and that Guenther and Herbert knew about them, detailing their . dispersion among their empire from the company HQ in Berlin. Herbert even employed Ukrainian slaves on his weekend retreat outside the Reich capital. Guenther was described as an 'opportunist' who enthusiastically helped the regime to rid Berlin industries of Jewish workers before the start of the war. This was despite his numerous contacts with Jewish bankers in the years before the Nazis began their climb to power. Admission: Stefan Quandt, pictured with his mother Johanna, has said his family - including father Herbert - was 'part of the Nazi system' He was also 'unscrupulous' in his take-overs of Jewish firms which were forcibly sold for a pittance to loyal German industrialists such as himself. 'The family patriarch was part of the Nazi regime', judged the historian in the 1,200 page study. 'The Quandts connected themselves inseparably with the crimes of the National Socialists.' The Quandts were pressured into commissioning the study after a 2007 TV documentary in Germany entitled The Silence Of The Quandt Family. Five days later, as the press headlines about a fortune built on blood piled up, the reclusive family announced its full backing for the research project. At the time it said: 'The accusations that have been raised against our family have moved us. 'We recognize that in our history as a German business family, the years 1933 to 1945 have not been sufficiently cleared up.' BMW, of which the Quandts became major shareholders 15 years after the war, was not implicated in the documentary. 'We were treated terribly and had to drink water from the toilets. We were also whipped,' said Takis Mylopoulos, a forced labourer who worked in Quandt's Hannover plant. In 1946 Guenther Quandt was arrested and interned. To the surprise of many, he was judged to be a 'Mitlaufer', or fellow traveller -  namely someone who accepted the Nazi ideology but did not take an active part in crimes. He was released in January 1948. An AFA technician repairing a battery cell in a German type IX boat in 1942.

The Quandt family still owns the majority of shares in luxury car manufacturer BMW . One of the prosecutors in the Nuremberg trials, Benjamin Ferencz, now says that if today's evidence against him had been presented to the court at the time,'Quandt would have been charged with the same offences as the directors of IG Farben' - the makers of the gas used to murder the Jews at Auschwitz. Quandt was able to re-install himself in the supervisory boards of various German firms such as Deutsche Bank. He also became an honorary citizen of the University in Frankfurt in 1951. He died on holiday in Cairo on December 30, 1954.","Guenther Quandt was a member of the Nazi party and benefited from its 'Aryanisation' programme by taking over Jewish firms .

"A veteran cop and married father of three shot himself on his way home from work yesterday, becoming the fourth NYPD police officer to take his own life in less than a month. Highway-safety officer Matthew Schindler, 39, pulled onto the side of the Long Island Expressway near Exit 40 in Jericho at 4.30pm on his way back from a shift in Queens before shooting himself under the chin. Minutes earlier the 14-year veteran, described by a friend as an 'an all-around great guy' had texted his sergeant to say he wouldn't be seeing him any more. Tragic: Veteran cop Matthew Schindler, 39, has become the fourth NYPD officer to kill himself in less than a month (file picture) His fellow officers were ordered back to the 115th Precinct stationhouse, where flags were lowered to half mast, to be told the tragic news. According to the New York Post, when told the distressing news Bill Genet, the head of volunteer group Poppa that helps troubled police officers, exclaimed: 'Oh, God, not another one.' Schindler is the second NYPD officer to commit suicide in eight days and the fourth since the start of the year. On February 5, 20-year veteran Brian Saar, a father of twin five-year-old daughters, shot himself at his home in Suffolk County after apparently arguing with his wife at a party. On January 19, officer Terrence Dean, 28, shot himself with his service pistol while on duty at the scene of a Queens car burglary after getting a phone call from his fiancée Maria Stuart, urging him to get help for his severe depression. (File picture): Officer Schindler pulled onto the hard shoulder of the Long Island Expressway near Exit 40 in Jericho at 4.30pm on his way back from a shift in Queens before shooting himself under the chin . According to Ms Stuart he replied: 'Fine, I'm going to kill myself,' before pointing his gun at his head and pulling the trigger. Minutes earlier Ms Stuart had called the precinct to leave an anonymous tip warning that one of the their officers was suicidal. She said that in the days leading up to the suicide, Dean had threatened to kill himself and those around him a number of times. The day before he died, Dean threatened to kill himself by putting his gun in his mouth while at home with Ms Stuart. Ms Stuart said that part of the reason why he was depressed was because he felt that his family had pressured him into becoming a police officer instead of pursuing his dream of being a fire fighter. On Jan. 15, rookie Patrick Werner, 23, killed himself at his parents’ home in Yorktown Heights after fleeing from a car accident.","Father of three Matthew Schindler, 39, shoots himself in patrol car on way home from work ."
"A war veteran says he was harassed and humiliated by an employee of a Houston Starbucks who refused to allow him into the store because of his service dog. Yancy Baer was visiting the city on behalf of an organization that trains service dogs which are provided to disabled people. However he found he was a victim of discrimination as a Starbucks worker attempted to force him to prove his disability. Scroll down for video... Standing up for justice: Disabled veteran Yancy Baer was confronted by a Starbucks employee about his service dog Beanz and forced to prove he had a disability in order to be allowed into the store . Animal helper: A Texas war veteran who recently had his lower leg amputated was barred from entering a branch of Starbucks after an employee refused to believe the dog was a service animal . Insult: The confrontation took place at this branch of Starbucks in Houston. The company have since apologized . Still adjusting to his life as an amputee, doctors discovered Mr Baer had bone cancer after a non-combat related injury in Iraq in 2009. His left leg had to be amputated from the knee down and was given a physical service dog, Beanz, through a national organization called Canine Companions for Independence. However, as soon as he walked through the door of the coffee chain, the trouble started. A Starbucks employee approached him as he entered with Beanz, his service dog. 'You can't have dogs in here,' the worker yelled at him. Story to tell: A disabled U.S. army veteran says he was confronted and embarrassed at a Houston Starbucks because of his service dog . Companion: Service dog Beanz remained loyal throughout but even she doesn't like Starbucks anymore! 'It was in your face, loud and bold. I got really nervous. I was shaking because I was being confronted,' he said in a posting on Facebook. Mr Baer explained that Beanz was a service dog. The employee countered, 'you're not blind!' to which he replied 'I know and she isn't a seeing eye dog, she's a physical service dog.' Beanz had her bright blue service vest and working collar on at the time of the encounter. 'Well what does the dog do?' the staffer demanded to know. Upon explaining the ways in which his dog performed tasks for him, the war veteran was not prepared for the employees response: 'Why can't you do that yourself?' he was asked. Mr Baer says he was humiliated and embarrassed in front of a crowd of spectators. Eventually, he spoke with another employee and got his point across. The employee who stopped him at the door later apologized for what happened. 'I was floored and starting to shake a bit at this point, I'm wearing pants but still, it's none of your business and he had NO right to say that to me,' said Mr Baer. In a posting on Facebook, Mr Baer's frustration at the situation is clear. 'This whole time the guy is in my face, being loud and I'm trying my hardest not to choke slam his ass.' 'The only thing that prevented this a-hole from a trip to the hospital was the fact that I was with an individual to have an important meeting about... wait for it, SERVICE DOGS!' he writes. 'People with disabilities, you can’t always see those disabilities. You never know what a service dog is for,' said Baer to KHOU. BY his side: Yancy Baer is sharing his story in hopes of educating others. He is still adjusting to his life as an amputee . Prove it! Mr Baer was yelled at in the store and told 'You're not blind!' He believes, had he been wearing shorts, that his disability would have been more obvious . Mr Baer was wearing pants at the time. He believes the employee wouldn’t have made such a big deal had he been wearing shorts. He hopes others learn that a person with a service dog doesn’t need to have an obvious or visible disability. 'Be careful about who you approach and how you approach it. You’ve got to be sensitive to people,' said Mr Baer. 'This isn’t acceptable. It can’t be acceptable.' Starbucks have since apologized. A corporate spokesman says that are using Mr Baer's experience as a coaching tool. The company have also released a Statement: . 'Starbucks always welcomes service animals to our stores, and this customer’s experience is not consistent with the welcoming and friendly environment we strive to create for everyone. We have spoken with this customer to apologize for his experience, and we hope to have the opportunity to serve him again. We have also spoken with our store partner about this situation and used this as a coaching opportunity for the future.' Mr Baer says he holds no hard feelings toward Starbucks as a company but in a posting on Facebook he says he will never step foot in another Starbucks for the rest of his life.","Veteran walked into Starbucks but got into a confrontation with an employee who wanted him to prove his disability .

"Headstones were pushed over and vandalised with swastikas by racist thugs in a sickening attack on a Jewish cemetery. Blackley Jewish Cemetery in Manchester was hit between 4pm on Sunday, June 22 and 3.30pm the following day, when the sickening damage was discovered. Two 13-year-old boys were arrested on suspicion of committing a racially aggravated public order offence on Friday. Racist: Nazi swastikas were scrawled on headstones at a Jewish ceremony in Manchester. Headstones were also pushed over and smashed in the attack . Now the defiant community has rallied around to clean up the cemetery. More than 100 people from different walks of life came together to help restore the site after the disgusting attack. Harry Johnston, who helped organise yesterday’s clear-up, said it was a ‘heartwarming’ event to be involved in. He added: 'These people have done a sterling job. We’ve had people from all different walks of society here - including Muslims, Christians and volunteers from Greater Manchester Police. 'A chap in a dog collar brought a whole bunch of people straight from a service down the road. 'It has been a really uplifting thing to watch a community battered into the floor again coil up like a spring and come back flying.' One grave was vandalised with a white power symbol and 'Kampf', likely a reference to Adolf Hitler's book. Right, Harry Johnston, from the North Manchester Jewish Cemeteries Trust charity, inspects the damage . Mr Johnston, from the North Manchester Jewish Cemeteries Trust (NMJCT) charity, said organisers had only expected around 20 people to show up - so were overwhelmed by the turnout. He added that so many people came that there was not enough cleaning equipment to go round - so the work had to be done in shifts. The volunteers cleaned up the grounds of the cemetery, on Rochdale Road in Blackley, and cleared away items that had been dumped there including a refrigerator, a settee and a mattress. Two 13-year-old boys were arrested on suspicion of committing a racially aggravated public order offence on Friday . Hope: A huge clean-up operation was held at the Jewish cemetery, with volunteers from numerous faiths . So many people volunteered that there was not enough cleaning equipment to go round - so the work had to be done in shifts . The damage to the headstones will take longer to repair and is the responsibility of the families affected. But Mr Johnston said wrecked children’s graves from the 1900s would be paid for by NMJCT. He added: 'I was extremely upset by the attack and felt terrible for the families turning up after it happened. But the community has come out on top.'

"The Supreme Court said Thursday it will consider whether retailer Abercrombie & Fitch discriminated against a Muslim woman who was denied a job because her headscarf conflicted with the company's dress code, which the clothing chain has since changed. The justices agreed to hear the Obama administration's appeal of a lower court decision that ruled the New Albany, Ohio-based company did not discriminate because the job applicant did not specifically say she needed a religious accommodation. At issue is how employers must deal with laws that require them to make allowances for a worker's religious practices, as long as doing so does not cause the business too much hardship. A federal judge initially sided with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which sued on behalf of Samantha Elauf. Standing up for herself: Samantha Elauf, 20, of Tulsa, says Abercrombie & Fitch refused to hire her because she wears a head scarf for religious reasons. She has taken her complaint to the U.S. Supreme Court . The agency alleged Elauf wasn't hired at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, store because her hijab violated Abercrombie's 'look policy', described at the time as a 'classic East Coast collegiate style'. But the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision. The appeals court said Elauf never directly informed her interviewer she needed a religious accommodation, even though she was wearing the headscarf during her interview. Abercrombie, which has faced slumping sales and could face negative publicity in the case, has pressed on with its defense, saying it was Elauf's obligation to explain any special needs based on her religion. The company has settled two other EEOC discrimination lawsuits over the same issue and it changed its 'look policy' four years ago to allow its workers to wear hijabs. In their brief for the EEOC, government lawyers said the appeals court ruling undercuts legal protection for religious practices because it unfairly places the entire the burden on the job applicant to raise the issue. Under fire: Abercrombie and Fitch say they never received actual notice of a religious conflict with its company-enforced dress and appearance codes . Sometimes job applicants aren't aware of a potential conflict between a religious practice and a company policy, the government said. In this case, the EEOC says Elauf never requested an accommodation because she didn't know about the 'look policy'. The agency also claims that Abercrombie was clearly on notice that Elauf needed to wear the headscarf for religious reasons, or else it wouldn't have denied her a job. Abercrombie's lawyers say the law is clear that an employer must have actual knowledge that a religious conflict exists before any accommodation is offered. The company argues that job applicants 'are not permitted to remain silent and to assume that the employer recognizes the religious motivations behind their fashion decisions'. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued on Elauf's behalf after she was denied a job at Abercrombie Kids in Tulsa in 2008. Now the U.S. Supreme Court will make a ruling on the case . In 2013, the company settled two other EEOC discrimination suits filed in California. In one case, a judge determined the company fired a Muslim worker from a California store, while another judge said it refused to hire another woman in the state because of her refusal to remove the hijab during work. The court will hear arguments next year in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 14-86.","Samantha Elauf interviewed for a job at Abercrombie Kids in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 2008 .

"An adventurer has finally finished his epic 24-year road trip - driving a staggering 556,000 miles through 215 countries in the same trusty car. Gunther Holtorf, 77, set off in his Mercedes 300GD with his late wife Christine in 1990, with the plan of visiting Africa. They tackled gravel and mud-covered, pothole-ridden roads without problem and, after seeing the continent, decided to keep going. Scroll down for video . Gunther Holtorf, 77, recently finished his 24-year road trip, after driving a staggering 550,000 miles . In his Mercedes 300 GD, Gunther and his late wife Christine set out with a plan of visiting Africa - and kept going . The two rear seats of the car were removed in order to accommodate a mattress and clothing storage . The result was an epic adventure which saw the Mercedes - nicknamed Otto by Christine - driven through 215 countries and into the record books. In fact, their Mercedes has been in more countries than any other car. Of the 556,000 miles, it is estimated 155,000 were off road as the 4x4 was driven across 410 borders outside Europe. It went in 41 ocean shipping containers and boarded 113 deep-sea ferries. Of the 556,000 miles that Gunther and his late wife Christine travelled, it is estimated that 155,000 of those were off road . In 1990, the pair visited Paris (left). And Gunther vowed to continue travelling when his wife Christine passed away in 2010 . In 2011, Gunther took his car - nicknamed Otto - to Mount Everest, which is 5,200 metres above sea level . Also in 2011, Gunther and Otto travelled on China's Karakorum Highway . During the journeys, Otto endured temperatures of -27 degrees Celsius in Siberia and +50 Celsius near Alice Springs, Australia. They even drove to the base camp of Mount Everest, which is 5,200 metres above sea level. When Christine sadly passed away from cancer in 2010, Gunther vowed to carry on with their trip. He has now finally finished his epic adventure. The former airline executive ended the journey at the Brandenburg Gates in Berlin and is now back home in Bavaria, Germany. In Brazil in 1987, the pair ran into some unexpected traffic . Gunther's Mercedes 300 GD even traversed across Algeria. Pictured: Otto with the Sahara in the background . Gunther and Christine met new friends in India in 2005 . The Mercedes has been in more single countries than any other car. Pictured: Otto in India in 2005 . The pair snap a photo of an elephant next to their beloved Mercedes in India in 2005 . Apart from reinforced suspension, Otto is completely standard and still has the original engine, gearbox and axles. Under the bonnet is a three-litre diesel engine which develops a modest 88bhp. To make the car more practical, the rear seats were removed and it was fitted with two custom-made mattresses. There was also a storage space for clothes, food, tools, spare parts and kitchen utensils. After travelling through Africa, the intrepid pair headed to South America, then North America before visiting Asia and Australia and Europe. In 2007, the couple travelled to Thailand, where they drove Otto to a monastery . An indigenous woman of Myanmar poses inside Gunther's well-travelled Mercedes . An epic road trip!

"Apple, Samsung and Amazon are each trying to lure new customers with futuristic technologies such as fingerprint scanners, 3D graphics and eyeball-tracking technology. However, a recent poll has revealed the majority of smartphone owners simply want a phone that’s easy to use and has a long battery life. In fact, almost three quarters said they refuse to be swayed by gimmicks and novelty features. The poll was conducted by London-based uSwitch.com. Long battery life (stock image pictured) was listed as the top reason for buying a phone among 89% of respondents, with a waterproof case being the second most popular feature among 67% of people who took part in the study . The poll was carried out by London-based uSwitch.com using an online survey of more than 1,605 mobile customers on pay-monthly contracts. Long battery life would make 89 per cent of respondents more likely to buy a smartphone, while a waterproof body (67 per cent) and a zoom camera lens (66 per cent) were in second and third place. Three quarters (75 per cent) said eyeball-tracking technology - as seen on the Samsung Galaxy S5 - would make no difference to their purchasing decision, while 69 per cent said they wouldn’t be lured by a phone with a voice control function, like Apple’s Siri or Samsung’s S Voice. More than six in 10 said 3D graphics, as shown off at the US launch of Amazon’s Fire Phone, wouldn’t make them any more or less likely to buy a handset, either. Three quarters (75 per cent) said eyeball-tracking technology - as seen on the Samsung Galaxy S5 (pictured) - would make no difference to their purchasing decision, while 69 per cent said they wouldn’t be lured by a phone with a voice control function, like Apple’s Siri or Samsung’s S Voice . More than six in 10 said 3D graphics, as shown off by Amazon chief executive Jeff Besos (pictured) at the US launch of Amazon’s Fire Phone, wouldn’t make them any more or less likely to buy a handset, either . Of those who already have these features, almost two thirds (66 per cent) admitted to never using eyeball tracking, and more than half (55 per cent) never use voice control. Interestingly, almost a third (32 per cent) who have fingerprint-scanning security have never used it. Almost one in eight of the respondents said they don’t own a smartphone, but have a feature phone instead. Of these people, nearly half said they simply don’t feel they need a smartphone, while 28 per cent are put off by the cost. Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com, said: ‘It’s becoming increasingly hard for smartphone makers to differentiate their handsets from those of their rivals. 'They hope that flash features like Fingerprint ID on the iPhone 5S, or Amazon’s Fire Phone and its ‘Dynamic Perspective’ display, will give their phones the edge. Of those who already have these features, almost two thirds (66 per cent) admitted to never using eyeball tracking, and more than half (55 per cent) never use voice control. Almost a third (32 per cent) who have fingerprint-scanning security (as seen on the iPhone 5S pictured) have never used it . ‘However, our research shows that many can spot a gimmick from a mile away. It’s actually the basics that affect the everyday user experience - like long battery life and a robust design - that people really care about.’ ‘That being said, it doesn’t take long for science fiction to become science fact in the mobile world, and features that we considered to be gimmicks just a couple of years ago like touchscreens and front-facing cameras are now integral to our daily smartphone experience. ‘So whilst great handsets are available that do the job, sometimes a bit of futuristic phone tech is just what’s needed to move the industry forward.’","The poll was conducted online by uSwitch.com in July 2014 .

"Here's one Great War medal that was never worn on parade. But, then, it was not awarded for gallantry or leadership or distinguished conduct. It was awarded to the winner of a vegetable-growing competition for the military near Le Havre in 1918. Alongside the medal sits a calling card from a Madame Juliette, proprietor of an extremely dubious address in Arras. ‘Where are we going tonight??’ it asks, above an invitation to ‘Voir ces Dames’ (literally, ‘see these ladies’). Then there’s a smart red leather medical wallet from royal chemists Savory & Moore, sent by a worried family to a Lieutenant at Gallipoli. The various sachets include cocaine — for ‘a tickling cough’ — and opium — for ‘diarrhoea and dysentery’. No prescription needed, it seems. They are just a few examples from the most extraordinary collection of World War I memorabilia in existence. After almost a century under wraps, much of it is being prepared to go on display in what will be the most comprehensive exhibition on the Great War ever mounted. Careful, kitty: An officer of 444 Siege Battery, Royal Garrison Artillery, smokes a pipe as he supervises a kitten balancing on a 12in gun shell near Arras . With just under a year until the centenary of the outbreak of ‘the war to end all wars’, the  Government has announced plans for a four-year programme of commemorative events, ranging from state occasions to a street-naming project in honour of those awarded the Victoria Cross. At the centre of it all, however, will be the overhaul of London’s Imperial War Museum to create a powerful and permanent record of the conflict in the new, purpose-built First World War Galleries. A £35 million appeal, supported by the Daily Mail, is well underway. With the Duke of Cambridge as its patron, it aims to raise the necessary funds in time for next summer’s centenary. The project is so ambitious that the entire museum was closed in January to allow extensive construction work to take place. Now partially reopened, it will still be several months before the museum is fully operational once more. But the new galleries are expected to see visitor numbers rise by 30 pc to 1.3 million each year, reinforcing the Imperial War Museum’s position as the world’s pre-eminent museum of modern warfare. Send in the clowns: The Concert Party from the Tank Corps pose in front of an early Great War tank . Daily life: A soldier of the 15th London with French tots, left, and right, an artilleryman brings the post in for his battery near Aveluy in 1916 . ‘I can’t think of a better way to help educate new generations about the effects of war on all our lives,’ says Viscount Rothermere, publisher of the Daily Mail and chairman of the IWM Foundation. The first Lord Rothermere, who lost two sons in the Great War, donated the museum site to the nation in 1930. The new galleries will be almost double the size of the previous First World War exhibition, and staff are already going through the vaults gathering a vast cross-section of archive material for display. It is a monumental challenge to do justice to every aspect of the war. The galleries will be divided into sections devoted to themes such as the shock of war, the ‘Citizens’ War’ and so on. Today, the Mail can reveal a selection of unseen items and photos destined for the section devoted to ‘Life at the Front’. For every single day of the war, on the Western Front alone, Britain lost 577 soldiers. But when these men weren’t fighting, they spent much of their time contriving normality. Some took to planting vegetables. Others indulged in painting or writing (indeed, next Wednesday’s BBC 2 drama, The Wipers Times, tells the true story of a newspaper produced by troops in Flanders). Making music: A gunner plays the banjo for his friend at the entrance of his dug-out in Guillemont . An entire artistic genre — what the . museum calls ‘trench art’ — evolved. Among the most impressive examples . is a shiny brass swagger stick constructed entirely of bullet cases and . coins. Some, like Lieutenant Herbert Preston, . enjoyed taking photos, despite strict rules banning photography. He . sent his work back to his wife, who, in turn, would sell some to the . Press under the cover name of ‘Mrs Maxwell’. The . museum has also been through its archive to uncover pictures of . regimental ‘Olympics’ and of amateur theatricals amid the mud and ruins. One bizarre image shows three members of . the ‘Tonics’ (stage name for the Royal Flying Corps Kite and Balloon . Section Concert Party), rehearsing Cinderella in the snow at Bapaume in . January 1918. (The passing band of Tommies do not seem overly . impressed.) Another shows a troupe of Pierrot clowns gathered round an early tank. You SHALL go to the ball: Three members of the 'Tonics', the Royal Flying Corps Kite and Balloon Section Concert Party, at the dress rehearsal of ""Cinderella"" taking place in snow covered ruins . Among the most poignant exhibits are some of the lucky charms which men carried into battle: a metal pig, a horseshoe, a lump of shrapnel extracted from an earlier wound . . . There is, sadly, no record of whether their owners lived to tell the tale. Back home, meanwhile, there was a roaring trade in gifts for loved ones at the Front. An entire patriotic postcard industry evolved. Some inventions, however, were utterly useless, like the Winter Trenchman Belt, promising ‘Protects from body vermin and chills’. ‘It seems to have bred more lice than it stopped,’ says curator Laura Clouting. ‘But, as ever, it’s the thought that counts.’ The last veteran of the Great War may have passed away, but thanks to the school history curriculum, the internet-driven surge in genealogical research and easy access to the battlefields of the Western Front, the memory of 1914-1918 is certainly not receding from our collective national memory.

"Do you always take off your make-up before bed? Every night? Even after a glass of wine too many? Or when you've fallen asleep on the sofa? Or you simply couldn't muster the energy? You're not alone. In a recent survey, a third of women questioned confessed to sleeping with their slap on at least twice a week. Yet those very same women did so despite believing that skipping their skincare routine before bedtime would give them spots, dry their skin and make their eyelashes brittle. Before and after: Experts said Anna's skin aged by ten years as a result of not removing her make-up for an entire month . They even said they thought it would age their faces by more than two days for every night that they didn't bother. So if we think that such slovenliness is that bad for our skin, why aren't we more assiduous about cleansing? In my case it comes down to priorities. On any given evening, my 'to do' list (which can be tackled only once the children, aged four and seven, are asleep at 8.30pm) includes loading and unloading the dishwasher (several times), tidying toys away and answering emails. Then there's the washing, filling in homework diaries, sorting school uniform and coaxing our contrary cat out from behind the garage. All this means that make-up removal frequently falls off the bottom of the list. But how much harm can a bit of war paint really do? Isn't this just another example of beauty companies scaremongering in a bid to flog us yet more skincare products we could possibly do without? To find out, I took up the challenge of leaving my make-up on not just for a night, but for a whole month. I would give my face a cursory wash in the shower each morning but I would be allowed to use none of my usual cleansing creams, and would have to reapply new make-up over the remnants of the old each day. About face: Sleeping with her make-up on for a month left Anna's smooth skin looking cracked and red . In order to measure any changes in my skin statistically rather than subjectively, I went to see Nick Miedzianowski-Sinclair at the 3D Cosmetic Imaging Studio, based at the Queen Anne Medical Centre just off Harley Street. Nick analysed my face using a special 3D camera which shows - in mortifying detail - my pigmentation, broken veins, enlarged pores and wrinkles. My flaws were then compared against the average woman of my age (40, since you ask) to give me a percentage score. Suspecting that make-up worn overnight for a protracted spell might prove very drying, Nick also took moisture readings across my cheeks and lower and upper forehead. And then the experiment began. Although there was a temptation to be circumspect, knowing that I wouldn't be able to take my make-up off, I followed my usual routine. On went the Max Factor Facefinity foundation, the Diorshow mascara and the L'Oreal eyeliner, finished off with a slick of Guerlain lipgloss. Night one, and after a hot, sticky day that included commuting back and forth across London on the Underground (always a surefire way to make skin feel filthy), I was desperate to cleanse and moisturise. But I hid my trusty Una Brennan creamy cleanser in a high cupboard and went to bed in full make-up. The following morning my pillowcase seemed to have suffered more than my skin. Other than having rather itchy eyes and some stubborn clumps of mascara hanging on to my lashes like limpets, I appeared relatively unscathed. After my morning wash, I slathered on some moisturiser, and added another layer of make-up. By night three, however, it was a different picture. I had developed a series of tiny white cysts around my eyelashes and my skin was so dry and taut, it felt like a mask. By the weekend, a few friends had commented that I was looking tired. Close inspection of my skin in a magnifying mirror revealed the surface had become flaky and lumpy, a bit like a badly plastered wall. Moreover, the foundation that I had once loved looked dry and crepey on my skin. In a bid to rehydrate my parched face, once or twice I tried putting moisturiser over the surface of the make-up at night. But this served only to smear it in a wider arch across the pillowcase. My eyelashes, meanwhile, seemed to have stuck together into two giant mono-lashes, meaning applying further mascara was getting difficult. On several occasions I caught myself pulling eyelashes out in clumps and became genuinely concerned that they might all come out. One particularly scary morning, around ten days in, I woke up to find my left eye so swollen, I could barely open it. An optician friend assured me I'd simply caught a mascara-laden lash in it overnight and it would soon settle down. Mercifully he was right, but I did skip eye make-up for 48 hours after. I'm all for experimentation, but not if it actually blinds me. As weeks progressed, my lips became dry and my skin cracked painfully at the corners of my mouth. With the end of the month approaching, I felt truly grubby and fed up. I had developed an intense aversion to mascara application and feared I may have done permanent damage to my skin. I had visibly blocked and enlarged pores all over my nose, dry skin across my lips and cheeks and red eyelids. The white cysts had given way to some nasty-looking eyelash dandruff. For an objective assessment, I went back to Nick Miedzianowski-Sinclair's 3D camera and asked dermatologist Dr Stefanie Williams, medical director of the European Dermatology London clinic, to explain the results. Not quite sleeping beauty: In a recent survey, a third of women questioned said they sleep with their slap on at least twice a week . PAINFULLY PARCHED . The camera showed that the surface texture of my skin was around ten per cent worse (i.e. more uneven) on my forehead and on the right hand side. On the left hand side, it was around 20 per cent worse, which Nick explained was probably down to the fact that I sleep on my left side. This meant that even less oxygen would get to the skin here, which would magnify any problems that the lingering make-up might have caused. According to Dr Williams, the decline in texture was almost certainly down to me skipping my twice-daily moisturising routine. This resulted in seriously parched skin, a fact proven by Nick's other tests, which showed a five per cent drop in moisture levels. 'Not only is the top layer of skin dry,' said Dr Williams, 'but a layer of make-up will also prevent normal skin shedding, slowing down the usual renewal process, resulting in uneven and dull textured skin.' ALL LINED UP . Although the wrinkles on my forehead hadn't worsened significantly, they had become deeper on both the right and left hand sides of my face. Dr Williams said that it's no coincidence these were also the driest parts of my face. 'When skin is dry, it's less elastic so wrinkles are more prominent,' she told me. She also believes that this dryness would have been compounded by environmental pollutants sticking to the make-up, causing what is known as oxidative stress, where skin is attacked by harmful free radicals. 'These molecule-sized compounds cause damage to various cellular structures in the skin and can actually decrease production of collagen - the substance that gives skin its plumpness - compounding the wrinkle issue,' she explained. Walking the line: While the wrinkles on Anna's forehead hadn't worsened significantly, they had become deeper on both sides of her face . SEEING RED . My skin is sensitive and prone to redness anyway. This meant that even before the experiment, I scored in the bottom six per cent of women my age. A month in, and it had become two percentage points worse. Any more of a downward slide and I would be an off-the-scale mass of angry, dilated facial capillaries. Dr Williams told me this redness was a sign of irritation in the skin. 'Sleeping in make-up,' she warned, 'has an occlusive effect (it forms a barrier over the surface of the skin). 'This means any irritants are locked in, exacerbating any allergic reactions, and moisturisers are locked out.' MY POOR PORES . Deep cleanse: Long-term avoidance of washing while continuing to wear make-up is detrimental to skin in the long run . The pictures showed that my pores were about five per cent larger than they had been at the start. Dr Williams said this was partly due to physical clogging. 'Dirt in pores not only makes them more noticeable and thus appear larger but, over time, we think it can actually stretch them.' However, she also believed that it was a sign that my skin had aged over the month. 'Older people naturally have larger pores because, with age, elasticity decreases so the structures that support the skin, and keep pores tight, become slacker.' EXPERT CONCLUSION . The experts estimated that my skin was biologically approximately a decade older than before I began my no-cleansing experiment. This proved what my mirror reflected: my face genuinely has aged by as much as ten years in a month, and all because I didn't take my make-up off. I'm terrified that the damage might be permanent. Have I ruined my skin - and my looks - for ever? Fortunately, Harley Street cosmetic dermatologist Dr Sam Bunting reassured me. 'You won't have done any meaningful damage in four weeks,' she said. 'But long-term avoidance of cleansing while continuing to wear make-up could be detrimental to your skin in the long-run. 'The biggest issue is the accumulation of environmental pollutants, which drive the generation of free radicals. 'These contribute to the breakdown of collagen and elastin, the structures that underpin youthful skin. While these structures deteriorate with age, you don't want to do anything to speed up that process,' she adds . I don't need telling twice. From now on, however busy I am before bed, cleansing will be number one on my to-do list.","A recent survey reveals a third of us sleep with our slap on twice weekly .

"Grammy winner Kelly Clarkson has hit out at music legend Clive Davis for 'spreading false information' about her in his new tell-all memoir. The 30-year-old star wrote a damming open letter today after the record executive claimed that she broke into 'hysterical sobbing' when he demanded that her smash hit 'Since U Been Gone' be included on her album, Breakaway. Kelly - whose stellar career was guided by Davis after she won American Idol - lashed out, saying: 'I refuse to be bullied and I just have to clear up his memory lapses and misinformation for myself and for my fans. It feels like a violation. Growing up is awesome because you learn you don't have to cower to anyone - even Clive Davis.' Happier times: Record legend Clive Davis with his protege Kelly Clarkson in 2004. Today, she accused him of 'bullying' her. In what is turning into a war of . words between the pair the 80-year-old took to Twitter to defend his . book, writing: 'I am truly very sorry that she has decided to take issue . with what I know to be an accurate depiction of our time together.' Clive said. “Before the book was . published, I had every fact checked with five independent individuals . who were present on a daily basis throughout it all.' In his book, The Soundtrack of my Life, the 80-year-old music executive - who discovered Whitney Houston - tells how he fell out with Kelly over her desire to help pen her own songs on her third album, My December. However, Davis recalled that he didn't believe the material contained a number one hit and told the singer's manager he was 'out of his mind' to believe otherwise. Emotional: Kelly Clarkson is overcome as she picks up the Grammy award for best pop vocal album this month . He also wrote about a meeting with Kelly in in which he told her that My December was “a pop album that still needs pop hits'. But in a lengthy statement posted on Whosay, Kelly wrote: 'So I just heard Clive Davis is releasing a memoir and spreading false information about me and my music. 'First, he says I burst into ""hysterical sobbing"" in his office when he demanded Since You Been Gone be on my album. Not true at all. His stories and songs are mixed up.' She said they rowed after Kelly insisted that she wanted more guitars added to the original demo track - and Davis did not, saying she eventually prevailed, adding: 'I couldn't be more proud of the life of that song. I resent him dampening that song in any way. 'But, yes, I did cry in his office once. I cried after I played him a song I had written about my life called ""Because Of You."" 'I cried because he hated it and told me verbatim that I was a ""s****y writer who should be grateful for the gifts that he bestows upon me.' 'He continued on about how the song didn't rhyme and how I should just shut up and sing. This was devastating coming from a man who I, as a young girl, considered a musical hero and was so honored to work with. 'But I continued to fight for the song and the label relented. And it became a worldwide hit. He didn't include that in the book.' Clive replied on Twitter: 'The chapter [Kelly's] as it is written was thoroughly verified by each and every one of them. I stand by the chapter as written in my book. At the same time I wish, and will always wish, Kelly‘s talent and her career to soar to ever new heights. Overjoyed: Kelly picked up her third Grammy of her career at the music awards ceremony in LA on February 10 . Kelly revealed that she was hurt by his accusations about her album My December and its lack of 'pop hits'- and the claims that it didn't chart to well because she co-wrote it. She also accused Davis, currently the Chief Creative Officer of Sony Music Entertainment, of actively trying to 'sabotage' the album. She said  'Well, first let me say, I've co-penned many of my ""pop hits."" Secondly, My December went platinum (It sold 20,000 less than All I Ever Wanted which followed My December.) Hardly a huge failure. 'Never Again, the ONLY single they released in the US from that record was a Top 10 hit. 'I am very proud of that and I have my fans to thank. But, again, what's most interesting about his story is what he leaves out: He doesn't mention how he stood up in front of his company at a convention and belittled me and my music and completely sabotaged the entire project. Engaged: Kelly Clarkson and her fiance, Brandon Blackstock, beam at the Grammys earlier this month . Charttopping hits: Kelly Clarkson in her videos for Because of You and Since U Been Gone . 'It never had a chance to reach it's full potential. My December was an album I needed to make for myself for many reasons and the fact that I was so completely disregarded and disrespected was so disheartening, there really aren't words to explain….' Kelly, who is signed to RCA records, won her third Grammy award earlier this month for Best Pop Vocal Album for her fifth studio album, Stronger. And the star, who is engaged to music manager Brandon Blackstock, finished her message by writing: 'Anyway, I love my job. I love my music. I love my fans. I love my label and all of my professional relationships… now. And I am grateful for Clive for teaching me to know the difference. 'Cheers to another amazing year.'","Sony chief responded to claims by Kelly he had 'memory lapses' saying he stood by everything he wrote .

"A village in northern Morocco has been shocked by the birth of a two-headed calf. Born on December 30, the young animal was named Sana Saida, which means 'Happy New Year' in Arabic. Since its birth, the creature has been attracting a lot of attention, with locals of Sefrou, a village less than 20 miles from Fez, flocking to the farm to see it. This two-headed calf was born in the northern Moroccan village of Sefrou, which is less than 20 miles from Fez . The cow was named Sana Saida, which means 'Happy New Year' in Arabic, after being born on December 30 . The calf is known as polycephalic, which means having more than one head. And despite the appearance of the calf, Sana Saida was not the first of its species to be born in this way during 2013. In October a little heifer born with two heads in Whiting, Vermont, United States, was hailed as a ‘blessing’. The calf was supposed to be a twin, but the eggs did not separate properly, a vet revealed. The birth has attracted a lot of attention in the village, which lies in the northern Moroccan mountains . The newly born calf is pictured here tied to its mother four days after the birth . The calf, pictured with its owner, is known as polycephalic, which means having more than one head . The animal was capable of eating from both of its mouths. In another extraordinary case earlier last year, a New Zealand farmer delivered a stillborn calf that had eight legs, four ears, two bodies and one head. And in January 2011, a two-headed cow was born in Georgia. The farmer said that the animal ate with both heads – just like the calf in Vermont. Last year, a ranching family from Anadarko, Oklahoma, United States, became famous for their six-legged calf. The extra legs were attached to the cow's back.

"Hundreds of applicants for a prestigious computer science course at  Carnegie Mellon University were erroneously told they'd been accepted - because of a computer glitch. About 800 applicants were told they'd been accepted on to the course at the Pittsburgh institution, but were then informed that the acceptances were sent in error and that they'd be rejected. Ben Leibowitz was one of the hopefuls who was a victim of the embarrassing slip-up. He called up relatives to tell them he had got in and even went out to dinner with his parents to celebrate. Then he got a second email saying he hadn't been accepted after all. Hundreds of applicants were told they'd been accepted into a prestigious master of science in computer science course at Carnegie Mellon university (pictured) 'It was brutal. I didn't get much sleep last night,' Leibowitz, of Stamford, Connecticut, said Tuesday. 'Now I have to clean up the mess. I'm calling all my relatives, I'm going, ""I'm sorry it's not happening.""' Carnegie Mellon spokesman Kenneth Walters said the 'Welcome to Carnegie Mellon!' messages were the result of 'serious mistakes' in the university's process for generating acceptance letters and that it would conduct a review to prevent another error. 'We understand the disappointment created by this mistake, and deeply apologize to the applicants for this miscommunication,' Walters said. The university sent a follow-up email to the rejected students Tuesday afternoon, saying its system had 'incorrectly flagged' applicants as being admitted. Dozens of applicants shared snippets of their rejection emails along with hints of their own disappointment on a message board for people applying to graduate programs. Carnegie Mellon's computer science graduate school tied for No. 1 with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley in U.S. News & World Report's most recent rankings. Carnegie Mellon's computer science graduate school tied for No 1 with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley in U.S. News & World Report's most recent rankings . The university said in the erroneous messages that it accepts less than nine per cent of more 1,200 applicants - or about 100 people - into the master's program each year. But all the technological know-how and selectivity in the world couldn't prevent the university from joining the list of high-profile institutions that accepted applicants when they didn't mean to. In December, Johns Hopkins University mistakenly sent nearly 300 undergraduate applicants welcome messages when they were actually rejected or deferred. In February 2014, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology sent thousands of students a mistaken email about financial aid saying they were receiving the information because they had been admitted. In 2009, the University of California at San Diego sent acceptance emails to all 46,000 students who applied, including 28,000 who were rejected. Elisa Davis, a consultant who helped Leibowitz prepare for the graduate admissions tests, said she'd never heard of erroneous acceptance letters at the graduate school level, in part because the process is much more personal than for undergraduates. 'People need to put care into things that affect other people,' Davis said. 'I'm very disappointed in them.'","Eight hundred Carnegie Mellon applicants were told they'd been accepted .

"A Boston University student group is demanding the school cancel an upcoming Robin Thicke concert, complaining that the lyrics to the singer’s 2013 smash Blurred Lines are sexist. More than 1,600 people have signed an online petition started by members of Humanists of Boston University to get Thicke’s March 4 date at the school’s Agganis Arena cancelled. ‘Thicke’s hit song, Blurred Lines, celebrates having sex with women against their will,’ the group’s petition at change.org states. Scroll down to see video . A Boston University student group is demanding the school cancel an upcoming Robin Thicke concert, complaining that the lyrics to the singer's 2013 smash Blurred Lines are sexist . Number one: Despite controversy the Blurred Lines single topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart last year . ‘Lyrics such as, “I know you want it,” explicitly use non-consensual language. And while watching the extremely explicit video, the insinuations grow from subtle to explicit to obnoxious.’ ‘Clearly, Boston University has been a bedrock for feminism and ideologies of equality more generally. It is a dishonor to our feminist history to symbolically idolize Robin Thicke by allowing him to perform his misogynist music at our university,’ the petition adds. ‘We see this as a blatant form of reinforcing rape culture and sexism,’ Patrick Johnson, the organization’s president, told Fox. Blurred Lines was a massive hit song globally last summer for married-singer Thicke. 'Rapey': Robin Thicke's lyrics and video for new single Blurred Lines have outraged people everywhere but also provided him with his biggest ever hit . Members of Humanists of Boston University are trying to get Thicke's March 4 date at the school's Agganis Arena cancelled . The song - which he recorded with Pharrell and rapper T.I. - may have hit the number one spot on the . Billboards Hot 100 chart but it was also lambasted for its misogyny. The lyrics were accused of being 'rapey' and the controversial video featured woman prancing around wearing nothing but thongs, while the fully dressed male singers ogled then and sang 'I know you want it'. Thicke infamously performed his massive hit at the MTV Awards along with Miley Cyrus and during the Grammy Awards show in January. The song was a Grammy nominee. A university spokesman says it is unlikely the show would be canceled. He said Boston University had nothing to do with booking the show, one stop on a 16-show tour. An email to a Thicke spokeswoman was not immediately returned. Too risque: The unrated video for Blurred Lines was banned by YouTube for obvious nudity . The unrated version of the video was . banned from YouTube for the obvious nudity, while a censored version has drawn over 250million views. Other parts of the video feature T.I. brushing Emily Ratajkowski’s hair and a blonde woman lighting Robin's cigarette before he blows smoke in her face. In addition, silver balloons spell out 'Robin Thicke has a big d***' and verse three of the song's lyrics are: 'I'll give you something big enough to tear your a** in two.' Tricia Romano of The Daily Beast wrote a commentary enitled Robin Thicke’s Summer Anthem, Is Kind of Rapey. She wrote: 'The subject [of the song] . itself is enough to make some female music fans uncomfortable. The song . is about how a girl wants crazy wild sex but doesn’t say it - positing . that age-old problem where men think no means yes into a catchy, . hummable song.' Lisa Huynh of Feminist in LA first . slammed the song in April and wrote: 'Has anyone heard Robin Thicke's . new rape song? Basically, the majority of the song … has the R&B . singer murmuring ‘I know you want it’ over and over into a girl’s ear. Sexist: The video caused a stir because while Thicke and his fellow male performers, Pharrell and T.I., are dressed, the woman wear very little . In the nude: The women wear just thongs in the video, while the men remain fully clothed . 'Call me a cynic, but that phrase does not exactly encompass the notion of consent in sexual activity.' And Thicke's comments about the video didn't exactly help him to win back female fans. In an interview with May's GQ magazine he said: 'We . tried to do everything that was taboo - bestiality, drug injections, and everything that is completely . derogatory towards women.' 'What a pleasure it is to degrade a woman,' he continued. 'I’ve never gotten to do that before. I’ve always respected women.' The 36-year-old singer- who is . happily married to actress Paula Patton - tried to defend the song on . the basis that both Pharrell and T.I. are 'happily married with . children' and that because they are settled in their personal lives they . were both 'the perfect guys to make this.' Thicke previously said that director Diane Martel came up with the idea of using nude models. 'As long as it's fun and the girls are comfortable let's do something silly,' Thicke said. 'Let's take some chances.' Charming: Thicke has admitted that the inspiration for the single was being 'derogatory to women' Blatant misogyny: The video in large part is made up of the men ogling the scantily clad women while pulling or brushing their hair and whispering 'I know you want it' into their ears .","A Boston University student group is demanding the school cancel an upcoming Robin Thicke concert .

"The Alaskan TV reporter who quit live on air so she could fight to legalize marijuana allegedly smoked so much weed at home that she made her neighbor's four-year-old daughter ill. Charlo Greene, who stormed out of the KTVA studio after saying, 'f*** it, I quit', was served with a temporary restraining order two weeks ago following complaints from her neighbor, TMZ reported. Tyler Gilbrech, who lives below the Anchorage apartment shared by Greene and her boyfriend, said the couple immediately began making the building smell after they moved in in June. It became so bad that his young daughter became violently sick from the fumes, TMZ reported. Scroll down for videos . Devoted: Charlo Greene, a former Alaska news reporter who quit to fight to legalize weed, has been served with a restraining order for smoking so much marijuana at home that it made a neighbor's daughter ill . Support: She lived at the Anchorage apartment with her boyfriend Peter, pictured, until two weeks ago . He complained to the building manager and she allegedly told him to 'watch his back', focing him to fight for a temporary restraining order against her two weeks ago. Greene countered that Gilbrech was the one harassing her and had intended to file her own restraining order but didn't get around to it. She has since left the building, where she lived with boyfriend Peter, and must stay at least 20 feet away from Gilbrech and his family. As well as leaving her home, Greene has also said goodbye to her job after storming out of KTVA's studio after presenting a segment on the Alaska Cannabis Club and revealing she was its owner. Speaking out: Greene quit live on air, pictured, after revealing she was the owner of a marijuana business . Fight: She later uploaded a video to YouTube, pictured, explaining why she believes weed should be legalized . 'And as for this job, well, not that I have a choice but, f*** it, I quit,' she said. After the video became an internet hit, Greene released her own YouTube video detailing why she believes marijuana should be legalized in Alaska. 'Why differentiate my toke from your beer,' she asks in the video. 'We smokers are responsible, contributing members to society.' Greene is moving on to dedicate herself full time to making sure that measure passes and along with the video has posted an Indiegogo fundraising page to help her in the cause. On the page, she is asking for $5,000 in donations, which she intends to put toward re-educating voters on the dangers, or lack thereof, of marijuana use. She has raised more than $6,400 so far. She writes: 'As a member of the media, I've seen the dirty campaign tricks and lies that prohibitionists have been using over the past several months to sway Alaskan voters firsthand.' Fan: On an image on her Facebook page, Greene can be seen giving marijuana plants the thumbs up . At work: She believes people should not be penalized for what she says is a harmless passtime . The Alaska Cannabis Club connects medical marijuana cardholders with other cardholders who are growing cannabis. On its website, the club bills itself as striking 'a perfect balancing act with Alaska's Medical Marijuana laws'. Growers are offered 'donations' as reimbursement for the costs of growing the plant, the club said in an interview with Alaska Dispatch News in August. The club said it hopes to increase access to medical marijuana patients, despite operating in a legal grey area within Alaska's murky medical marijuana laws. But not everyone is happy about Greene's sudden career change, including KTVA, which took to Twitter to apologize for her outburst on air. 'Viewers, we sincerely apologize for the inappropriate language used by a KTVA reporter on the air tonight,' it wrote.

The chain last saw a major eruption in 1960. As a precaution, the government evacuated 3,500 people from the surrounding area. It was the latest in a series of volcanic eruptions in Chile in recent years. Chile's Chaiten volcano erupted spectacularly in 2008 for the first time in thousands of years, spewing molten rock and a vast cloud of ash that reached the stratosphere. The ash also swelled a nearby river and ravaged a nearby town of the same name. The ash cloud from Chaiten coated towns in Argentina and was visible from space. Chile's Llaima volcano, one of South America's most active, erupted in 2008 and 2009. Chile's chain of about 2,000 volcanoes is the world's second largest after Indonesia.

"Ann Romney slammed the door Monday on another attempt at the White House for her husband Mitt, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee. Attempting to put a pin in rumors that her husband is secretly plotting another campaign for higher office once and and for all, Romney told a reporter for the Los Angeles Times that she and Mitt were 'done' running for president 'completely.' 'Not only Mitt and I are done, but the kids are done,' she said, referring to the couple's five sons. 'Done. Done. Done,' she added, making her feelings on the matter crystal clear. Ann Romney, wife of 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, attempted on Monday to put a pin in rumors that her husband is secretly plotting another campaign for higher office once and and for all . Mitt has repeatedly said he's not preparing for another run, but a series of vague statements from both Romneys about what it would take to change their minds have had the political world buzzing for the last several months about a possible 2016 campaign. First Mitt claimed that 'circumstances can change.' Then Ann indicated that her husband may consider a comeback if former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush bowed out of the race. Mitt tried to clear up any remaining doubt about his intentions earlier this month, telling a horde of reporters chasing him around a Kentucky event for for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, 'I'm not running, I'm not planning on running and I expect to be supporting one of the many people who I think are looking at this race.' He repeated the refrain in an on-camera interview with Bloomberg reporters John Heilemann and Mark Halperin. 'I'm not letting my head go there. Where I'm focused on making sure we nominate the right person, who cares about the kinds of issues I care about,' he stated. In her interview with the LA Times, Ann said she hadn't 'been pushed to that point mentally' to truly consider another run, and the publication said she indicated that she and Mitt would make the decision together if it ever came to that point. Among Ann's list of 'really interesting' Republicans who may enter the race next year, the LA Times said, were Bush, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman and her husband’s 2012 running mate, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan. 'We’re going to see a nice field shake out,' she said. Mitt has not said who he's leaning toward in 2016. 'We have a number of different voices within our party that have have different views about where America should go, and I look forward to supporting one of them,' he said, according to The Courier-Journal. Former Massachusetts Gov. and GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, right, speaks on behalf of Iowa Republican State Senator and U.S. Senate candidate Joni Ernst, left, during a  rally on Saturday in Cedar Rapids, Iowa . Romney was flocked over the weekend by supporters of his previous presidential campaigns. They're hoping he decides to run again even though he's explicitly said he won't . Romney supporters have continued to hold out hope that the retired Republican politician will change his mind, however, and are aggressively encouraging him to run when he makes appearances on the campaign trail for the GOP candidates competing in November's elections. 'When you get elected to the Senate, your job should be to convince Mitt Romney to run for president again,' a donor reportedly told Iowa senate candidate Joni Ernst him last weekend at a private fundraiser that Romney headlined. The Washington Post says that at another event for Ernst on Sunday night, several businessmen approached Romney about another run. At a rally for Ernst on Monday, the Post says a state legislator who introduced Romney said, 'If his address was 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, I would sleep a lot better.' Attendees also chanted, 'Run, Mitt, run!' the Post reported. Romney has experienced similar nudging from backers at events across the country. Clad in Romney campaign gear, dire-hard fans have turned out at several major campaign events the former Massachusetts governor has spoken at this fall. But the Romenys have their designs set on other, non-political projects after the midterm elections, including spending more time with their children and 21 grandchildren, and raising money for the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. The Romneys are in the process of launching the Ann Romney Center for Neurological Diseases at Brigham. The LA Times, which interviewed Ann for the specific purpose of talking about the research facility, reports that the center will look for cures and treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, ALS, Parkinson’s disease, brain tumors and a research facility that will focus on finding cures and new treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, a disease Ann suffers from. Ann Romney is seeking to raise $50 million dollars in seed money for the center to mirror the 50 million people afflicted with the five diseases, the Times said. Tonight the Romneys are hosting a dinner for former donors and political associates - strictly to raise money for the research center, the Post reports.","She attempted to put a pin in rumors that her husband is secretly plotting another campaign for higher office once and for all .

"For decades climbing enthusiasts have sought to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Hilary and conquer the highest peak on Earth - Mount Everest. But behind them, they have left a trail of destruction - creating an average of 50 tons of rubbish, including discarded oxygen canisters, climbing gear and food packaging, every year. The problem escalated to the point where the fragile ecosystem of the Himalayas was under threat. But after three years of hard graft in life-threatening conditions, a pioneering to team of clean up experts believe they are about to solve the mountain's pollution problem for good. Clean up: A pioneering project has seen tonnes of hazardous rubbish brought down from the summit of Mount Everest . Intrusion: Piles of abandoned climbing gear and human waste has threatened to wipe out the Himalayan eco-system . Problem: This huge haul of discarded oxygen cylinders demonstrates the scale of rubbish dumping on Mount Everest . Hundreds of tons of human waste, abandoned climbing gear, tents, oxygen bottles, discarded food packing and even bodies littered the mountainside and threatened to destroy an entire eco-system just decades after mankind first reached it. Villagers who have made their homes in the Himalayan slopes have had their isolated lives intruded on by wealthy westerners chasing fame and glory - and left with contaminated drinking and food supplies. The problem forced the Nepalese government to react almost a decade ago, forcing Everest tourists to take responsibility for their gear having already paid a £45,000 premium to climb the mountain. And a group of environmental volunteers orchestrated the Saving Mount Everest project to begin the unenviable mission to clean up the world's highest attraction. Writer and environmental photographer Martin Edstrvm has worked with the group to capture the scale of the issue and revealed the changes that need to be made. Martin said: 'The enormous growth in . visitors has brought great strains on the natural environment and . produced mountains of rubbish - from base camp and up to the high 'death . zone'. 'In Sherpa villages along the trekking routes there has never been a sustainable waste disposal system in place. 'As . 50 tons of waste is left behind every season, the consequences have . been an eyesore and a threat to the fragile environment.' The overall goals of the project, . which officially launched in 2010, are to conserve and manage the rich . biological diversity of Nepal's Sagarmatha/Everest National Park. The . emphasis is on solid waste management and on supporting and . strengthening local communities as the caretakers of biodiversity . conservation. End in sight: After three years of hard work collecting rubbish the team believe their project is nearing completion . Change needed: Campaigners will ask climbing groups to sign up to a Code of Conduct in future to safeguard the future of the mountain . After three . years of death-defying work, scaling the treacherous peaks to clean up . after others, the group are nearing completion. They . have pulled down almost 10 tons of hazardous trash from Everest's . summit, introduced safe waste management techniques for local villages . and tourists and installed at least 15 waste treatment facilities. New era: The group have also introduced waste treatment facilities and safe waste management techniques to the local village . The . project workers, led by Austrian Kurt Luger, have strived to implement a . system of sustainable waste control and are taking the chance to finish . their work in the current summer climbing season. Kurt . said: 'Our main focus is on improving the waste management situation in . the Khumbu/Everest area and to raise awareness about it. 'Working . with EcoHimal we support the local institutions in improving existing . systems, a new incinerator is in use and porters, locals and school . students get training on how to manage waste properly. 'We've . also installed waste bins along the trails - the next step will be to . co-finance public toilets for tourists and porters - as toilets either . do not exist or currently in extremely poor condition.' The . project has now grown to bring together governments and organisations . working for preserving the wilderness close to Nepal's greatest natural . wonder. The next decade will . be challenging to preserve the groups' endeavours and ensure that all . future summit parties adhere to a new Code of Conduct. Phinjo . Sherpa, director of EcoHimal, said: 'People are very quick to talk . about the issue of waste in the mountains but nobody comes up with any . proper solutions. 'We cannot . afford to simply clean up Everest every now and then - we have to . educate people about waste management and ensure it happens.' The . volunteers are working with the Nepalese government to issue stricter . penalties for litterbugs - parties now have to sign a £2,500 deposit to . ensure they return all the equipment they went up with. But . despite fears that tourists would permanently destroy Everest and the . surrounding peaks, thousands of locals still rely on the economic boost . they bring. Threat: Around 50 tones of rubbish is left on Everest every climbing season . Eyesore: Just beyond the tourist trail lies a huge rubbish dump, right, but after three years of hard work the clean up is almost complete, left . Mountain guides and Sherpas make their living by leading expeditions to base camps and beyond, while entrepreneurs have set up small businesses to cater for seasonal climbers. The greatest climber of all time Apa Sherpa, who was born and lived on the rocky outcrops for 44 years leading wealthy mountaineers to the top, insists that tourism is a great thing for the country. Known as the 'Super Sherpa', Apa holds the record for climbing Everest an unsurpassable 21 times and has seen the effect of commercialisation on the local people. Apa, 51, said: 'I met Sir Edmund Hillary and it was very special, he used to come every year to Nepal and even our school was built by him - he helped the country a lot. With schools, monasteries, clinics and health care. 'Sherpa culture is very good and we want to preserve it and the tourists that keep coming is a good thing for poor Sherpa people and people who live in Nepal. They bring money and give us jobs that we depend on to support our families.' But Apa's views are not shared by everyone, as Buddhist leader Rimpuche Nawang Tenzing reveals the difficulties that have been brought by travellers. His Holiness said: 'We almost never had a problem with waste. What waste we produced washed away with snow and rain. 'The waste of today - metal tins, paper and plastic - can't be taken away just by snow or rain.'","Up to 50 tons of rubbish left by climbing tourists every year .

"It is a single moment of horrifying barbarism that provides a fleeting insight into the unimaginable hatred fuelling the war in Syria. A young Syrian rebel fighter barbecues the severed and blood-spattered head of a government soldier, lifting it triumphantly by the forelock as he poses for a picture. If this were not so stomach-churningly gruesome it would surely become one of the most enduring images of a conflict where the rules of war no longer apply and horror reigns... if it is indeed real.

Unprintable: A young Syrian rebel fighter barbecues the severed and blood-spattered head of a government soldier, lifting it by the forelock triumphantly as he poses for a picture . Blood can be seen dripping from the head through the grill onto the smouldering cinders of the barbecue. While bloated and blood-stained, the face is relatively unmarked, its features, including a well-trimmed moustache, clearly recognisable. The image - which is too graphic to publish in its original form - was posted on a pro-government website hosted in Lebanon and billed as proof of a war crime. The boy in the picture is described as a member of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and the head that of an Assad-loyal helicopter pilot downed with his crew by a rebel surface-to-air missile. There is no way of categorically verifying this image - with modern photographic technology, it could have been doctored as easily as it was apparently taken. But if it is a fake, it sheds fresh light on a war where the line between truth and propaganda is blurred beyond recognition and the extraordinary lengths to which these enemies will go to undermine the other. Joint force: Members of Islamist Syrian rebel group Jabhat al-Nusra hold a detainee as they transport him in Raqqa province, eastern Syria in a picture taken on March 14 . Imminent death: Free Syrian Army militiamen arrest a 'traitor'. Captured enemies of both sides more often than not suffer brutal executions in a war where rules no longer apply . Dr Craig Larkin, a middle east specialist at Kings College London, said - real or not - the picture reveals the sinister and growing role of PR in a war where simple brute force is no longer a ticket to victory. Where once battlefields were confined to rubble-strewn city streets, war-churned fields and dusty desert plains, they have spread online as both sides vie to control their public image and discredit that of their opposition. 'With the conflict now more or less at stalemate, it is fast becoming a tit-for-tat war of propaganda over who is committing the most barbaric atrocities - both for the benefit of local and international communities. 'The rebels have turned wholeheartedly to Facebook to promote their mission, regularly posting pictures and videos of their fighters having been tortured or killed by Syrian forces. Desolate: A man walks along a damaged street filled with debris in Deir al-Zor yesterday, which has seen heavy fighting in recent months . Warely bigger than his gun: A Syrian boy holds an AK-47 assault rifle in Aleppo, left, and a young female fighter, right, takes a break from battle. It is a war that has incorporated everybody, irrespective of age or gender . So young: A boy sells cigarettes on a street in Syria's northern city of Aleppo. In the poorer neighbourhoods of Aleppo, immersed in conflict for the past nine months, it was not unusual even before the war for teenagers to go out to work, but now what little childhood remained for Aleppo youngsters has gone . 'At the same time the government wants to justify to the world their line that they are fighting an Islamic terrorist uprising. 'It is an attempt to influence international policy by putting questions in countries like Britain's mind over whether they should be supporting such atrocities.' The website on which it was originally posted, goes on to list the names of the helicopter crewmen, claiming they were shot down as they travelled from Latakia Airport, on the country's Mediterranean coast, to deliver humanitarian aid supplies to villages inland. These 'martyrs' allegedly all survived the subsequent crash, in Idlib province, but were rounded up by the FSA's motley desert soldiers and all beheaded with butchers' knives and paraded through the streets on sticks. A Syrian human rights group says a key military unit loyal to President Bashar Assad is running secret prisons holding hundreds of suspected regime opponents. The Syria-based Violations Documentation Centre said in a report today that the regime's 4th Division runs detention centres in its bases in and around Damascus. The division is commanded by Maher Assad, the president's younger brother. It is considered a pillar of loyalist forces and is charged with defending the capital. The centre has tracked the dead, wounded and missing since the start of the uprising in March 2011. The claims could not be independently verified. Other rights groups say tens of thousands of opposition members of their families have been detained during the two-year conflict. According to the Independent, they are named on the site as as General Souhel Akram, parachute Major Youssef Ma’alla, Air Force . Captain Hussam Asaad, Air Force Captain Ayham Al-Hussain, 1st Lieutenant . Mohamed Ali Al-Dikar, 1st Lieutenant Maias Ramadan, and Sergeants Sarot . Ghanija and Mohamed Diben. It is not clear to which of those men the head in the picture is supposed to belong. Intriguingly, the website also . implies that the executioners were Sunni and their victim from the . Alawite sect of the Shia division of Islam to which President Bashar . Assad belongs, The Independent reports. Perhaps this in itself is not so . surprising, but it goes on to describe the perpetrators of the crime as . 'FSA gangs', while most such atrocities have so far been carried out by . Islamist militants - not these ragtag - and mostly sectarian - . militiamen. 'That they call them ""gangs"" is interesting', said Dr Larkin. 'It is an attempt to show there is no structure to the rebel uprising - that they are just a collection of disparate groups with no real purpose. 'The beheading element also plays into the government's grand discourse by highlighting beheading as a jihadist practice, further discrediting the uprising in the eyes of the West.' When approached by the Independent, . Syrian information minister Omran Zoubi said he could not confirm the veracity of the picture. Meanwhile, it emerged today that . Islamic militant group Hezbollah is backing mercenaries from neighbouring Lebanon to protect . Shiites on the Syrian side who claim their homes, villages and families . have come under attack from Sunni rebels. Hezbollah chief Sheik Hassan . Nasrallah, leader of many of Lebanon's Shiites and a staunch ally of . Syrian President Bashar Assad, has said his group is supporting the . cadres of fighters who call themselves Popular Committees. It is confirmation that the powerful Lebanese militant group is playing a growing role in the civil war just across the border. Syria's regime is dominated by . minority Alawites — an offshoot of Shiite Islam — while the rebels . fighting to overthrow Assad are mostly from the Sunni majority. Assad's . major allies, Hezbollah and Iran, are both Shiite. Refugees: Lebanese Safiya Assaf, center, said she had to flee the Syrian border town of Qusair along with her husband, seven sons and four daughters, and their families after their home and three shops repeatedly got hit during fighting . Ruthless campaign: Syrian policemen performing during a live-fire military exercise. A Syrian human rights group today said a key military unit loyal to President Bashar Assad is running secret prisons holding hundreds of suspected regime opponents . Under attack: A member of the Free Syrian Army runs along with two men to take cover from snipers loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, in Deir al-Zor yesterday . The sectarian tensions in the civil war have spilled over to neighboring Lebanon, which has a similar ethnic divide and a long, bitter history of civil war and domination by Syria. Deadly gunbattles have broken out in Lebanon in recent months between supporters of both sides of the Syrian war. But more broadly, Hezbollah's deepening involvement shows how the Syrian civil war is exacerbating tensions between Shiites and Sunnis around the Middle East. Syrian rebels accuse Hezbollah of fighting alongside Assad's troops and attacking rebels from inside Lebanese territory. Across the border: Mercenaries loyal to Islamic militant group Hezbollah patrol neighbouring Lebanon to protect Shiites on the Syrian side who claim their homes, villages and families have come under attack from Sunni rebels . Defence force: Hezbollah's deepening involvement shows how the Syrian civil war is exacerbating tensions between Shiites and Sunnis around the Middle East . Camouflaged: Deadly gunbattles have broken out in Lebanon in recent months between supporters of both sides of the Syrian war . In recent months, fighting has raged in and around several towns and villages inhabited by a community of some 15,000 Lebanese Shiites who have lived for decades on the Syrian side of a frontier that is not clearly demarcated in places and not fully controlled by border authorities. They are mostly Lebanese citizens, though some have dual citizenship or are Syrian. Before Syria's uprising erupted two years ago, tens of thousands of Lebanese lived in Syria. The Lebanese Shiite enclave on the Syrian side of the border is near the central city of Homs and across from Hermel, a predominantly Shiite region of northeastern Lebanon. One commander of the Popular Committees said Shiite villages have been repeatedly attacked and some residents have been kidnapped and killed by rebels. He said that prompted local Shiites to take up arms to defend themselves. 'We are in a state of defense. We don't take sides (between rebels and regime forces). We are here to defend our people in the villages,' said the commander, Mahmoud, who gave only his first name out of fear for his own security. 'We don't attack any area. We only defend our villages.'","The picture was posted on a pro-government website in Lebanon .
