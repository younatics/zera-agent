"By . Simon Walters . Updated: . 06:32 EST, 29 January 2012 . The ban on smacking children must be overturned to help prevent a repeat of last summer’s riots, according to a senior Labour MP. Former Education Minister David Lammy, who represents the Tottenham area of North London where the disturbances started, says working-class parents need to be able to discipline their children physically to deter them from joining gangs and getting involved in knife crime. Calling for a return to the Victorian laws on discipline, Mr Lammy said parents were ‘no longer sovereign in their own homes’ and lived under constant fear that social workers would take away their children if they chastised them. Aftermath: David Lammy inspects riot damage in Tottenham last summer. He wants the ban on smacking children overturned to help prevent a repeat of the mass disturbances . The MP said it was easier for middle-class parents to control their children as they could afford to pay for private schools, which have tougher discipline than state schools, as well as activities such as tennis lessons. Mr Lammy, 39, said he was smacked as a child and it taught him self-discipline and respect, adding that he had smacked his own sons, aged three and five – mainly to protect them from danger. He called for a reversal of Labour’s 2004 decision to tighten up the smacking law. Previously parents could use ‘reasonable chastisement’, while the new definition prohibits any force that causes ‘reddening of the skin’. Mr Lammy poured scorn on that description, saying it was irrelevant to black children. He said: ‘Many of my constituents . came up to me after the riots and blamed the Labour Government, saying, . “You guys stopped us being able to smack our children.” ‘When . this was first raised with me I was pretty disparaging. But I started . to listen. These parents are scared to smack their children and paranoid . that social workers will get involved and take their children away. Discipline: David Lammy, pictured with his wife Nicola Green, admits he has smacked his own children . ‘The law used to allow “reasonable chastisement”, but current legislation stops actions that lead to a reddening of the skin – which for a lot of my non-white residents isn’t really an issue.’ Mr Lammy – who is married to portrait artist Nicola Green, the daughter of the founder of the British Lung Foundation, Professor Sir Malcolm Green – said the law was designed for middle-class families, not those who lived with ‘fear outside their windows’. ‘Middle-class families can find all sorts of ways to handle children, by putting them in tennis classes or using traditional private schools,’ he said. Asked if he had smacked his own children he confessed: ‘I have smacked my kids, but it doesn’t happen very often – usually when they are in danger.’ The MP was pressed on the issue in an interview with Iain Dale on LBC Radio, after he had made a call on the Mumsnet website for smacking to be legalised. Parents in his area had to ‘raise children on the 15th floor of a tower block with knives, gangs and the dangers of violent crime just outside the window’, he said. ‘They no longer feel sovereign in their own homes. And the ability to exercise their own judgment in relation to discipline and reasonable chastisement has been taken away.’ He added that ‘middle-class’ MPs and Ministers had no idea of the ‘realities of the single mum struggling with these issues. We should return to the law as it existed for 150 years before it was changed in 2004’. The Children Act of 2004, introduced by Tony Blair’s Government, removed the defence of ‘reasonable chastisement’, meaning injuries as slight as a bruise can result in an assault charge. Guilty parents can be jailed for up to five years. Mr Lammy told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Parents in my constituency are frightened that if they smack their children, a social worker will come knocking at the door. ‘When the law changed in 2004, it was to deal with people who abused their children. The law at that time left judges to determine if a parent had used reasonable chastisement. Under the new arrangements it is left to social workers. ‘Single mums raising boys feel there are things that happen outside their front door – drugs, gangs or knife crime – where smacking is one of the things they should be able to do. They are confused about the law. We should allow 99 per cent of parents to determine how to help their children understand boundaries and learn right from wrong. Lack of discipline: Mr Lammy said many of his constituents had told him the outbreaks of nihilistic violence that characterised the riots had been down to their inability to properly chastise their children . ‘We have to distinguish between that and child abuse. No normal parent enjoys smacking their child. A lot do it from time to time and as children get older it stops. ‘I was smacked as a child. And I am hugely grateful for the role my mother played in my life. I wouldn’t be an MP if it were not for her.’ Mr Lammy was brought up in Tottenham by a single mother, Rose, and has previously spoken of his sense of ‘betrayal’ after his father walked out on the family when he was 11 years old. Mr Lammy set out his support for scrapping the smacking ban in his book Out Of The Ashes: After The Riots. He said that last year’s summer riots, which started after a man was shot dead by police in Tottenham, were ‘an explosion of hedonism and nihilism’, fuelled by police blunders – and not caused by Government cuts or joblessness. His predecessor as Tottenham MP, Bernie Grant, famously said police got a ‘bloody good hiding’ in the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot, when PC Keith Blakelock was killed. Mr Lammy’s constituency in the London borough of Haringey has witnessed two terrible child abuse scandals. In 2009, the mother of ‘Baby P’, Peter Connelly, and two others were jailed after he died, despite being seen by Haringey’s authorities 60 times. The council was also criticised after eight-year-old Victoria Climbie was starved to death in Tottenham in 2000.","Tottenham MP David Lammy calls for return to Victorian laws on discipline .

"By . Sara Malm . Wanted: Laszlo Csizsik-Csatary topped the Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center's list of alleged Nazi war criminals when he died aged 98 . One of the world’s most wanted Nazi war criminals has died in hospital while awaiting to stand trial for his actions during WWII. Laszlo Csizsik-Csatary, 98, faced charges of torture and deportation of thousands of Jews to concentration camps while working as a police commander in a Hungarian ghetto. Hungarian Csizsik-Csatary succumbed to pneumonia in Budapest on Saturday, his lawyer said today. Csizsik-Csatary was found guilty of whipping Jews while overseeing a detention camp in the Nazi-occupied eastern Slovak city of Kosice, then a part of Hungary, in 1944, and was sentenced to life in absentia in 1948. He was able to flee to Canada where he claimed to be a Yugoslav national and was granted citizenship. Csizsik-Csatary was able to live an anonymous life in Canada, and worked as an art dealer before being stripped of his citizenship in the 90s when it emerged that he had lied on his application. Following his dispatch from Canada he lived hidden in Hungary until he was detained last July. In 2012, The Simon Wiesenthal Center named Csizsik-Csatary their most wanted war crimes suspect. ‘Csatary was responsible for sending 15,700 people to death camps,’ Simon Wisenthal centre's director Efraim Zuroff, told the Sun last year. ‘He was known to be a sadist, he had a determination to round all Jews up and forcibly deport them to Poland.’ Several Holocaust survivors have given testimony to his brutality during the Nazi occupation of Hungary. 'I remember Csatary loudly screaming orders at Jews and I heard the terrible things he did,’ Yishayahu Schachar said in 2012. ‘I remember women digging a ditch with their hands on his orders. He was an evil man.’ Charged: Hungarian Csizsik-Csatary was due to stand trial, accused of being 'actively involved' in the torture and deportation of thousands of Jews from a ghetto in Kosice, east Slovakia . In June Hungarian prosecutors charged him with being 'actively involved in and assisted deportations' in 1944 of Jews from a ghetto in Kosice. The former police officer 'regularly beat the interned Jews with his bare hands and whipped them with a dog-whip without any special reasons, regardless of their sex, age or health,' prosecutors said. Csizsik-Csatary also allegedly refused to allow ventilation holes to be cut into the walls of a railcar crammed with 80 Jews being deported. He was taken to court in Budapest but the case was recently suspended as authorities reviewed the impact of the 1948 conviction on the 2012 case. Prosecutors were challenging the suspension of the hearing when he died. Hungarian prosecutors accused him of regularly hitting Jewish prisoners with a dog-whip and helping arrange their deportation in Kosice, located in a part of Hungary which became Slovakian after the war. Csizsik-Csatary denied all accusations until his death.","Laszlo Csizsik-Csatary, 98, died of pneumonia in Budapest .

"By . Hannah Roberts . He has sworn to live a cloistered existence, shut off from all the world. But life after retirement doesn’t seem too lonely for Pope Benedict - with no fewer than four female companions to dote on him. The former pontiff, who stepped down in February, has been pictured for the first time with the women at his new home, a restored convent within the confines of the Vatican. Companions: The former pontiff, who stepped down in February, has been pictured for the first time with 'the four guardian angels', at his new home, a restored convent within the confines of the Vatican . Walking with the aid of a stick, Benedict, 86, strolled in the garden of Mater Ecclesiae, with the four lay sisters who are his constant companions. Rosella, Loredana, Carmella and Cristina, known as ‘the four guardian angels’, previously lived with Benedict in the luxurious Papal apartments and made the move with him to take care of cooking his meals, housework and secretarial work. Rosella is the most recent arrival, after her predecessor Manuela, was killed in a car accident in 2010. Loredana, who is from Puglia in the deep south of Italy is the chief cook preparing simple classics such as salmon and zucchini pies and pasta al prosciutto, Italian weekly gossip magazine Oggi reported. Carmela prepares the puddings, including the strudel from his native Germany that Benedict is crazy about, while Cristina is the secretary. Relaxed: In May the former Pope was seen walking in the grounds of Castel Gandolfo wearing a white baseball cap days after his retirement . Wearing his favourite white baseball cap to shield his face from the autumn sun and his Papal whites Benedict appeared to have lost weight since he was last pictured in private at the Papal summer palace Castel Gandolfo. The four women surrounded him protectively as he strolled, stopping to chat with gardeners and workers. The unusual household’s day starts at dawn, with mass in the chapel followed by breakfast. After that the Pope Emeritus retires to his study where he replies to his correspondence. He also spends time divided between meditation and prayer. Summer retreat: Former Pope Benedict pictured in 2010 in his summer residence where he is now enjoying his retirement . Retirement: The former Pope pictured blessing his followers for the last time as he arrived at Castel Gandolfo earlier this year . In the afternoon he takes a walk in the gardens, usually accompanied by the last member of the ‘family’, private secretary George Ganswein, a former ski instructor known as the George Clooney of the Vatican. The former Pope also spends a great deal of time reading, especially history and theology, and listening to the music of Mozart and Beethoven. It is a quiet life- there are not many visitors apart from his brother George who is a frequent guest staying in the spare room. The former convent has 12 monastic cells over two floors as well as a refectory, kitchen, infirmary and vegetable garden. It was founded by John Paul II in order to have a monastic group of nuns inside Vatican City, who pray for the pope and the Church.","Pictured for first time with women at new home within confines of Vatican .

"By . Associated Press . Mary O'Melia left Ireland for America as a young widow with three children before she was hired as housekeeper at the White House of the Confederacy. An intimate witness to history, she also has been much of a mystery. That was until this year, when a woman with a distinctive Irish lilt to her voice called The American Civil War Museum. The housekeeper, the woman said, was related to her late husband, and she had in her possession a necklace that Confederate first lady Varina Davis gave O'Melia. But there was more. Housekeeper: Mary O'Melia is seen in an undated photo provided by the American Civil War Museum. She served at the White House of the Confederacy in Richmond, Virginia as housekeeper for Jefferson Davis and his first lady, Varina Davis . 'What really took my breath away is she said she had a photograph of Mary,' said Cathy Wright, curator at the Civil War Museum, formerly the Museum of the Confederacy. 'Considering that it's been almost 150 years since she left the White House that anyone has been able to look at her face is just remarkable,' Wright said in an interview. The tintype adds a human dimension to what is a tantalizing but frustrating portrait of a woman who left her children in Baltimore to oversee the White House in the capital of the Confederacy during the duration of the Civil War but publicly revealed little of the experience. O'Melia was among a staff of 20, was a confidante to the first lady, and may have been in the mansion in April 1865 when President Abraham Lincoln visited after Confederate defenders left the city smoldering. Historical records are unclear on that point. The discovery is important nonetheless because the museum, which is next door to the White House, has strived to piece together the often untold lives of the African-American slaves, free people of color and European immigrants who worked as domestics for the Davis family. 'One of the more elusive figures was Mary O'Melia,' Wright said. O'Melia was a central character in this Southern version of 'Downton Abbey' and she remains a bit of an enigma. Even her name is a mystery. It's been spelled various ways through the years — O'Melia, O'Malley and O'Malla. This much is known: she was born Mary Larkin on April 7, 1822, in Galway, in western Ireland. She was educated in a convent, and apparently the fine needlework the religious order of nuns taught her may have influenced her hiring by Varina Davis. She married a ship captain, Matthias O'Melia, but was widowed at age 25 when he was lost at sea. While the circumstances of her journey to America are not known, Mary O'Melia settled in Baltimore in about 1850. In 1861, she left her children with relatives and headed to visit friends in Richmond, where she was marooned when Virginia left the Union. Told by friends Varina Davis could help her return north, she appealed to the Roman Catholic bishop to intercede on her behalf. First Lady: Varina Banks Howell Davis, wife of Jefferson Davis, is seen in an 1860 photo provided by the American Civil War Museum. Mary O'Melia served as a confidante to Mrs Davis. An intimate witness to history, O'Melia also has been much of a mystery . Ultimately, Davis prevailed upon O'Melia to take the position as housekeeper and companion to the first lady despite O'Melia's separation from her children. O'Melia would eventually remain at the Confederate White House until Richmond's fall in 1865. Despite her perch within the Confederate seat of power, O'Melia left little written accounts of her years in Richmond. She left it to others to speculate on her employment, including a reporter who wrote after her death of all the 'exciting conferences' she would have witnessed. When the first family left Richmond in April 1865, O'Melia remained to oversee the mansion. Writing from Danville days after his departure, President Jefferson Davis wrote to his wife: 'Mrs. Omelia behaved just as you described her, but seemed anxious to serve and promised to take care of everything which may mean some things.' Perhaps a more telling gesture of O'Melia's connection to the first family of the Confederacy was her correspondence with the Davis family after they parted and a wedding she and Varina Davis attended in 1867. They were the only white people in attendance at the wedding of Ellen Barnes, who had served in the White House. When Jefferson Davis died in 1889, O'Melia attended a memorial in Baltimore. A reporter said she 'attracted considerable attention' and was described as 'a well-preserved old lady.' Wright said O'Melia's story resonates particularly with her because she calls herself the 'modern housekeeper of the White House of the Confederacy.' 'I'm supposed to be over there keeping it clean and maintaining it so I've always felt a personal affinity for her,' she said. After her service at the White House, O'Melia returned to Baltimore where she operated boarding houses until her death in 1907.","Mary O'Melia left Ireland for America as a .

"By . Alice Smellie . Ski on: Paul Wilmott, 51, is back on the slopes thanks to a new type of bespoke knee replacement created with the help of a 3D printer . Keen skier Paul Wilmott feared he might never hit the slopes again after an old injury to his left knee flared up again last June. Even mowing the grass became painful and doing any exercise made it swollen, painful and unable to withstand pressure. He was forced to abandon his favourite pastimes of skiing and cycling. Yet thanks to a new type of bespoke knee replacement created with the help of a 3D printer, the 51-year-old company director was back in his skis by December. ‘I had no pain whatsoever, even though I was on the slopes at Ischgl, in Austria, for up to seven hours a day and skiing is renowned for putting pressure on knees,’ says Paul. ‘My new knee is remarkable and I feel so lucky to have the new implant.’ Paul has been fitted with a bespoke implant made by US company Conformis which uses the latest in 3D technology. The company says the implant makes recovery faster, there is less bone and tissue removed during surgery and knee function may turn out to be as good as new. Consultant orthopaedic surgeon Richard Carrington of Spire Bushey Hospital, Hertfordshire, who fitted Paul’s knee, says: ‘This is a huge advance – a bespoke knee replacement is like having a suit fitted and adjusted rather than buying a standard size over the internet. All knees are completely different.’ Knee problems like Paul’s develop because of cartilage wearing away. Cartilage covers each end of the bones in the knee – the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap) and tibia (shin bone) – allowing the joint to glide smoothly. When it wears away the bones are exposed and rub against each other. This causes pain, stiffness and swelling, and severely affects quality of life. There are around 85,000 knee replacement operations in the UK every year. A total replacement involves the worn part of all three bones being replaced with metal and plastic implants while a partial replacement replaces just one part. Mr Carrington last year performed five partial knee replacements using the Conformis option, along with about 120 standard replacements. The new bespoke replacement has been available in Germany for four years, and Mr Carrington trained for the surgery there. The procedure is offered in the UK at a few private hospitals, with limited NHS availability. The Conformis implant requires the removal of only up to 7mm of bone, compared to up to 12mm for a standard implant. Paul’ s implant is known as the iUni G2 and replaced his tibia. ‘You could see on scans that there was no cartilage left and the bones were touching,’ says Mr Carrington. For the procedure, the patient first has a CT scan to produce a 3D image of the knee. The design of the replacement joint is based on what engineers see on this scan. Next a mould is made to this specific design, using 3D printing technology. From this mould the engineers construct the bespoke implant using a plastic called polyethylene and a metal alloy known as cobalt chrome, hard-wearing materials that should last 15 years. These components exactly replicate the shape of the patient’s knee. The 3D engineers also print out iJigs – small bespoke plastic instruments – that slot on to the knee and show exactly where the bone has to be cut, improving accuracy and meaning fewer cuts are needed. The implant is fitted during an hour-long operation under general anaesthetic. The surgeon first makes a two to three inchlong incision into the inside of the knee cap and exposes the knee bones. Damaged cartilage is removed and small cuts are made into the bones. The parts of the replacement joint are inserted and fixed with bone cement. Paul had suffered from knee pain since his mid-30s. He says: ‘I went through years of pain and operations – I was on four types of pain relief a day. ‘By the time I had the replacement, I couldn’t even mow the grass because any weight bearing was agony. I love skiing, sailing and running so found the situation incredibly frustrating.’ He is thrilled with the results of his surgery, saying: ‘Next day I was able to put weight on my leg and two days later I was in the hospital swimming pool with a physiotherapist. I occasionally have discomfort but that’s unsurprising considering I’ve had about ten operations altogether. ‘I’m just so happy that I finally found one that worked – and worked brilliantly.’ spirebushey.com .","Paul Wilmott, 51, has been fitted with a bespoke knee replacement .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . According to a new report, Russian computer hackers managed to sneak a 'digital bomb' into the Nasdaq's computer system that is capable of sabotaging stock market computers and derail the U.S. economy. In the report, published by Bloomberg Businessweek, the 'cybergrenade' was never set off.

"By . Australian Associated Press . A Queensland man who died in the Malaysia Airlines tragedy joked about not returning from his European holiday. Before leaving Brisbane, 63-year-old retiree Howard Horder quipped that he was flying with Malaysia Airlines and only needed a one-way ticket, his brother says. It was a reference to the disappearance of MH370, which was en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur  in March. Scroll down for video . Howard Horder and wife Susan were among seven Queenslanders aboard flight MH17 . 'I spoke to him two days before he went on his holiday and he said he was flying with Malaysia Airlines,' Glenn Horder told AAP. 'I said, ""Jeez really?"" and he said, ""Yes, I only bought a one-way ticket"", but he was joking. 'He did buy a return ticket, but that's just my brother's sense of humour. 'He just said that because the other flight didn't come back.' Mr Horder and his wife Susan, 63, from Albany Creek in north-west of Brisbane, were among seven Queenslanders aboard flight MH17 when it was shot down over eastern Ukraine. There were 28 Australians among the 298 people killed. Glenn Horder said his family and neighbours were still coming to grips with the news. 'Most of the population of Australia can't believe you could go on a holiday and you're going to get shot down by a rocket,' he said. 'It's still hard to believe they're not coming home from a simple holiday.' Also on the doomed flight was Sunshine Coast-based 55-year-old Wayne Baker, and his wife Theresa, 53, who like the Horders were returning from a European holiday. Helena Sidelik, in her late 50s, was on her way home to the Gold Coast after attending a friend's European wedding.

'If Mr Putin's not prepared to do that, well frankly I believe that Queenslanders don't want him here at the G20,' Mr Newman said on Saturday. 'He has the opportunity to demonstrate some good faith and that can be done by properly getting behind international efforts to get to the bottom of what is clearly, in my view, a crime, a terrible crime.'

"By . Mark Duell . An Islamic hate preacher was tonight being investigated by police after a video showed him praising the terrorists who kidnapped more than 300 Nigerian schoolgirls. Mizanur Rahman, 31, of Palmers Green, north London, claimed in his recorded rant posted online that killing non-Muslims was ‘not necessarily a bad thing’ - and praised terror group Boko Haram. He said in the video: ‘People want to make it out as though history began on the day these girls were taken from - sorry I should say these women - were taken from this high school in Nigeria. Hate preacher: Mizanur Rahman (pictured), 31, of Palmers Green, north London, claims in his recorded rant posted online that killing non-Muslims is ‘not necessarily a bad thing’ - and praises terror group Boko Haram . ‘They didn’t do to these girls what the Nigerian government had been doing to the Muslims all these years. ‘They didn’t rape anybody. They didn’t torture. They didn’t murder any of these girls.’ He then described the terrorist group as being ‘full of good messages’, including its support for Al Qaeda. The sound of children’s voices could also be heard in the background during the recording. Rahman, a follower of firebrand preacher Anjem Choudary, was convicted in 2007 of soliciting to murder and given a six-year jail sentence. He was released from prison in 2010. But today, Mr Choudary - who set up the banned Al Muhajiroun organisation with exiled Omar Bakri Muhammad - said Rahman was a ‘good friend’ who had given a measured response to the crisis. Mr Choudary, who was taught along with Rahman by Omar Bakri said: ‘I believe if you look at what he was saying it was very measured. ‘You just have to look at the atrocities that, especially in 2011 and 2012, that were carried out against the women and child of Al Mujahideen by the Nigerian government. Kidnapped: More than 300 Nigerian schoolgirls were taken by terror group Boko Haram from a school in Chibok . ‘That story has not been told, and this is retaliation for that. The Americans are only interested in Nigeria because of its oil reserves, otherwise they would not be bothered. ‘Mizanur Rahman is a very good friend of mine, we are both students of Omar Bakri Mohamed. I have known him for 20 years, and I see him every day.’ Mr Choudary stopped short of condoning . the kidnapping of the schoolgirls, saying that he did not know enough . about the issue because he had to rely on all his information from CNN . and Sky News. 'I believe if you look at what he was saying it was very measured... Mizanur Rahman is a very good friend of mine' Anjem Choudary, firebrand preacher . He added: ‘Ultimately, Mizanur Rahman has not said anything illegal about Boko Haram and the girls. As I understand it they are being looked after very well. ‘They are not being raped, tortured and killed like Muslims have been at the hands of the Nigerian government. In war, I agree women and children should not be targeted. But this is an extraordinary situation.’ During Rahman’s trial ahead of his 2007 conviction, it was said that Rahman stirred up racial hatred after a protest at the Danish embassy over cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad. The Old Bailey heard he had cried out during the protest: ‘Oh Allah, we want to see another 9/11 in Iraq, another 9/11 in Denmark, another 9/11 in Spain, in France, all over Europe.’ Rahman told the London Evening Standard today: ‘On the one hand people are portraying them [Boko Haram] as crazed lunatics who don’t know anything about Islam or society in general. Firebrand preacher: Anjem Choudary (pictured) - who set up the banned Al Muhajiroun organisation with exiled Omar Bakri Muhammad - said Rahman was a 'good friend' who had given a measured response to the crisis . ‘But on the other hand if you actually read their messages they are not trying to destroy society, they are just complaining about the oppression against them and trying to better society. ‘Of all of their messages, some are good messages so they are full of good messages. What I’m trying to do is tell people the whole story.’ But Haras Rafiq, head of outreach for the counter-extremism think tank the Quilliam Foundation, said Rahman’s comments were ‘appalling and disgusting.’ He said: ‘These videos are dangerous because what he’s doing is creating an ""us and them"" situation and leaving people angry with a clear enemy. 'He is teaching how to hate and anger non-Muslims. That is a real threat to society and needs to be countered' Haras Rafiq, Quilliam Foundation . ‘The comments he’s made about Boko Haram are particularly dangerous, appalling and disgusting. He is teaching how to hate and anger non-Muslims. That is a real threat to society and needs to be countered.’ A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the video and we are assessing its contents. ‘We are not prepared to discuss this further.’ Violence linked to Boko Haram has resulted in an estimated 10,000 deaths between 2002 and 2013, including attacks on Western tourists and the bombing of churches, schools and police stations. The video has emerged as Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan vowed today to ‘do everything possible to bring our daughters home’, referring to the mass abduction of the schoolgirls. He said that the Islamic extremists who kidnapped them threaten the country's democratic gains.  The girls were kidnapped from a school in the town of Chibok on April 15.","Mizanur Rahman claims killing non-Muslims is 'not necessarily a bad thing'

"By . Nicola Harley . A legal firm that made more than £77 million from miners’ compensation claims has been dropped by a union after calling its members ‘thick’. The insult came in a training manual Raleys Solicitors wrote for its own staff. In it, a generic miner making a compensation claim is named ‘Mr Thikas Toosh Ortplanks’. The National Union of Mineworkers is no longer using the firm, saying its 90-year relationship has ‘soured’. Insult: Raleys (headquarters in Barnsley pictured) had been representing miners in damages claims for vibration white finger (VWF) Raleys had been representing miners in damages claims for vibration white finger (VWF). Sufferers have joint and muscle damage caused by working with vibrating hand-held machinery. Campaigner John Mann MP said the disparaging email showed the firm’s ‘breathtaking arrogance’. Raleys was among a group of law firms accused by a judge of cashing in on VWF claims and having more interest in taking their cut of payments than ensuring each client got the maximum compensation. The High Court ruled that Raleys failed to offer suitable advice to a miner over his VWF claim and now faces being sued by hundreds more clients. Raymond Barnaby, a miner for nearly 30 years in South Yorkshire, settled his claim for compensation for £10,822.01. However, after advice from Raleys, he dropped a further claim for help with services to aid with his disability. In the High Court, Lord Justice Maurice Kay said the firm had given ‘negligent advice’ to its client, resulting in him abandoning a claim which he may otherwise have won. Mr Barnaby was awarded £5,925 in damages. Condemned: Campaigner John Mann MP said the disparaging email showed the firm’s ‘breathtaking arrogance’ Chris Skidmore, chairman of the Yorkshire branch of the NUM, said Raleys had failed those who trusted them. ‘I feel very bitter about it,’ he said. ‘When you go to a professional you think they are giving you the right advice. ‘I’m appalled at our treatment and to refer to miners as “thick as two short planks” by people we placed our trust in is disgraceful. The NUM has used Raleys for 90 years and we recommended them to members. The relationship has soured.’ Mr Mann added: ‘Many solicitors got rich off the compensation scheme at the expense of hard-working miners who suffered serious illnesses as a result of their work. ‘Now it is essential that miners are helped to sue solicitors for the compensation they were rightly entitled to.’ Solicitor Robert Godfrey, of Mellor Hargreaves, which represents around 100 miners seeking damages from their law firms. He said: ‘We estimate there will be hundreds of claims now. We have individuals who have been badly let down by professionals, by people they put their faith and trust in – they were union solicitors.’ Raleys, based in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, handled in excess of 12,000 of the 180,000 claims nationally and recovered damages for more than 10,000 miners. Managing partner Carol Gill admitted the disparaging reference was in a staff training guide was a ‘poor taste joke’. She said the firm had settled five claims against it but succeeded in three similar compensation claims and was waiting to appeal two more.","Insult came in a training manual Raleys Solicitors wrote for its own staff .

"By . Leon Watson . Smirking casually after they were handed lengthy jail terms, these are the five men who killed a prominent critic of the Kremlin on Vladimir Putin's birthday. The men were convicted of gunning down the Anna Politkovskaya in the lobby of her Moscow apartment block eight years ago. Her death caused international outrage and allegations that the Russian authorities were involved. But Russia's hardline government has denied any role. Scroll down for video . The five defendants in the murder trial of Russian journalist and human rights activist Anna Politkovskaya . Today, the five exchanged smiles in their glass-fronted courtroom cage before they all received long sentences. It followed a trial last month which did not reveal who had masterminded the Russian journalist's murder. Politkovskaya, an investigative reporter who uncovered state corruption and rights abuses, especially in Chechnya, died at the age of 48 on October 7, 2006, President Vladimir Putin's 54th birthday. Judge Pavel Melyokhin agreed to the prosecutors' request to order life imprisonment for Rustam Makhmudov, found guilty of pulling the trigger, and his uncle Lom-Ali Gaitukayev, who organised the logistics. The other three received 12, 14 and 20 years. Politkovskaya was one of nearly two dozen journalists murdered in Russia since 2000, but her case attracted special attention because of the brutality of the contract-style killing and the failure of the authorities - even now, after nearly eight years and several trials - to identify who ordered the assassination. Kremlin critics and rights campaigners say the murder symbolises the weakness of the rule of law in Russia. The murder of reporter Anna Politkovskaya (left) happened on Russian president Vladimir Putin's 54th birthday. Putin is pictured (right) Dzhabrail Makhmudov (centre left) and Rustam Makhmudov (centre right) sit in the defendant's cage . Ibragim Makhmudov, centre, and Lom-Ali Gaitukayev, right, were convicted of the murder of journalist Anna Politkovskaya . 'I will be satisfied only when the person or people who ordered this will be sentenced,' said Politkovskaya's son Ilya. Her newspaper, the independent Novaya Gazeta, is still running its own investigation into the killing. 'For as long as the name of the mastermind is not known, there can be no talk of revealing the truth,' said its spokeswoman, Nadezhda Prusenkova. 'Today's sentencing is important, but only a step. They are the lowest level in this criminal chain, which must still be revealed and punished.' Makhmudov's two brothers, Ibragim and Dzhabrail, were sentenced to 12 and 14 years in a high-security penal colony for helping to shadow Politkovskaya. The fifth defendant in the year-long trial, former police officer Sergei Khadzhikurbanov, was given 20 years for his part in preparing the slaying. The court ordered the guilty men to pay 5 million roubles ($145,400) in compensation to Ilya and Politkovskaya's other adult child, Vera. At an earlier trial in 2009, a different jury embarrassed state prosecutors by acquitting three of the five defendants. Another ex-policeman was separately convicted and sentenced to 11 years in a penal colony, but his trial also failed to reveal the person or people behind the murder. Putin condemned the murder at the time but infuriated Politkovskaya's supporters by saying her ability to influence Russian politics had been 'extremely insignificant' and her killing had caused greater damage to Russia's image than her writing. The former KGB spy has clamped down on dissent since returning to the Kremlin for his third term in a 2012 election marked by mass protests. Lev Ponomaryov, a prominent human rights campaigner who worked with Politkovskaya, voiced a widespread belief in Russia that people in the higher echelons of power might have played a role in the killing. 'I am sure the name behind the murder will not be revealed under the current political regime. If the order came from the ruling elite's senior members, nobody will risk speaking because they know for sure that would cost their life,' he said.","Anna Politkovskaya was gunned down on Vladimir Putin's birthday .

"By . Kirsten Johnson . Concern: The opening ceremony for the Commonwealth Games had faced disaster over a music copyright issue . The opening ceremony for the Commonwealth Games faced disaster yesterday – after the organisers realised they did not have permission to use a track by one of the world’s biggest pop stars. For more than six months, 500 dancers have been rehearsing to the Calvin Harris hit Feel So Close. But with just five days to go until the showcase event in Glasgow, which will be watched by one billion people, they were told they would have to learn a brand new routine. Games organisers claimed Harris, 30, had failed to respond to their request for permission to use  his tune – so it would have to  be ditched. But last night, after being contacted The Mail on Sunday, the multi-millionaire DJ and producer gave the green light for the song to be used. His US-based spokesman said: ‘Calvin has given his permission for the dance troupe to use his track. It has been cleared and approved.’ Dancers had revealed their shock after being told on Friday by events firm Jack Morton Worldwide – which masterminded the Manchester Commonwealth Games ceremonies – that they would have to perform to a new track. One said: ‘Everyone booed – we were absolutely gutted. ‘The producer said Calvin was approached last November.  He said he was told Calvin’s publicist had passed the request to him but he hadn’t come back. ‘We were pretty angry and really anxious about getting new music at this short notice. We’re amateurs and what we’re doing is a lot of pressure so we need things to run smoothly.’ Now based in Los Angeles, Harris, who recently broke up with girlfriend Rita Ora, is estimated to have earned  £27 million last year.

"By . Jo Knowsley And Dominic Prince . David Cameron’s reshuffle was thrown into chaos last night after it was revealed his new Law Minister was found guilty of professional misconduct after illicitly obtaining case notes from a race-hate trial. Tory MP Robert Buckland, 45, was censured by a tribunal following his intervention into an enquiry over an attack by 13 Asians on a white pupil at a school where he was governor. Mr Buckland, appointed Solicitor General last week, last night admitted that he did not tell David Cameron of the charge. His new job includes making sure lawyers do not bring the profession into disrepute – as he was found to have done. New Solicitor General Robert Buckland was found guilty by the disciplinary tribunal of the barristers’ ruling body, the Council of the Inns of Court . He was found guilty by the disciplinary tribunal of the barristers’ ruling body, the Council of the Inns of Court, which was headed by fellow Tory MPs Kenneth Clarke, the then Justice Secretary, and Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General until last week. Mr Buckland yesterday faced calls to resign from his new post. The Mail on Sunday has learned that in 2011 Mr Buckland, a former barrister and part-time judge who has been MP for South Swindon since 2010, was hauled before a disciplinary tribunal of the barristers’ ruling body, after he broke the lawyers’ code of conduct by demanding court documents from a barrister. The censure of Mr Buckland by the Council of the Inns of Court . The incident occurred in 2008 when Mr Buckland was a governor at Ridgeway School in Wroughton, near Swindon, and had been asked to investigate an attack by an Asian gang – four of whom were pupils – on a white boy at the school. Henry Webster, then 15, was punched, kicked and hit with a claw hammer and his mother Liz Webster accused the school of being responsible. Thirteen men were later convicted of the attack. Following this, Mr Buckland, then a prospective MP, told Mrs Webster he was conducting an internal investigation. He also revealed he had asked a fellow barrister, Robin Shellard, who had defended one of the gang, Amjad Qazi, for case notes. Mrs Webster, however, was horrified at the breach. She said: ‘He was a school governor but if the school had been found guilty of racism that would have affected his career. ‘I think he should resign. I’m amazed he took up the appointment. I don’t see how someone who appears to have so little understanding of the law can take a job which demands this level of moral fibre, this level of responsibility. It’s also outrageous that he didn’t mention that he had this in his past when he took the job. He must have hoped it would all be swept under the carpet.’ Believing Mr Buckland was trying to ‘appease’ her, and furious he was breaching protocol, Mrs Webster told the police at the time. Mrs Webster said: ‘I had a meeting with Ed Balls who ordered a serious case review of the school, and I also told Michael Gove, the shadow secretary of education. Finally I went to the Bar Council.’ Documents obtained by The Mail on Sunday reveal Mr Buckland was called to a disciplinary hearing on March 31, 2011 to hear and determine the charge of professional misconduct at The Council of the Inns of Court. They state the defendants were found guilty of professional misconduct. Under Particulars of Offence they say: ‘Robert Buckland and Robin Shellard engaged in conduct likely to diminish confidence in the legal profession or the administration of justice or otherwise bring the legal profession into disrepute.’ They state the offence as: ‘Mr Buckland requested Mr Shellard to give him access to, and Mr Shellard agreed to provide access to, the case papers in the criminal trial of Amjad Qasi [sic] and others, the said papers being passed to Mr Buckland when Mr Buckland had no entitlement to be provided with those papers and both parties being aware he was not so entitled at the time.’ Amjad Qazi ,19, was jailed for a year for his part in the vicious attack on  Henry Webster that  left Henry with brain injuries . Mr Buckland’s school investigation never concluded because Mrs Webster launched a civil action against the school for failing to protect her son. She later lost. Last night Mr Buckland, a married father of twins, confessed to The Mail on Sunday that he had failed to notify the Cabinet Office of the misdemeanour. He said: ‘It’s a matter of public record. It’s been recorded by the Bar Standards Board. It happened three years ago. ‘It was a genuine attempt by me to establish facts at the school. This is the only time I have had any issue with the Bar Standards Board. I genuinely thought I was taking the right action for the school. I regret it ended up in the position it did.’ Mr Buckland tried to say the matter was ‘spent’ because more than two years had passed but last night the Bar Standards Board said disciplinary findings stay on a barrister’s disciplinary record indefinitely. Mr Shellard did not return calls made by The Mail on Sunday. Last night, a spokesman for the Solicitor General’s office said: ‘This finding was removed from the Bar records after two years and therefore Mr Buckland was not required to declare it upon appointment as Solicitor General.” But Labour’s Shadow Attorney General, Emily Thornberry, accused Mr Buckland of ‘bad judgement’ for failing to declare the offence. She said: ‘It is very important that the post of Solicitor General is one the Government and the public can have complete trust in.’ Labour last night said ‘we will be raising more questions about this matter’. Solicitor General and a crime that stunned us all . The Solicitor General’s ‘professional misconduct’ centred on a case where ‘reverse racism’ meant teachers allegedly turned a blind eye to Asian gangs targeting white children at school. The policy was designed to protect an influx of 20 Asian students whom teachers feared might be bullied when they arrived in 2005. In fact, as was later found by a serious case review, the reverse had taken place at the 1,450-pupil Ridgeway School in suburban Swindon. Liz Webster, whose son Henry was almost killed in an attack in January 2007, said: ‘Everyone knew what was going on at that school, that there was a culture of racism by the Asian students. ‘There had been a number of incidents. One boy had his nose broken by the same gang that attacked Henry. ‘Police knew about all it. But teachers wouldn’t deal with this reverse racism. They had this perception that the Asian kids were being racially abused when it was the other way around. ‘They created an Asian safe zone at the school and kept claiming the Asian kids were being victimised. There was a fear at the school of being perceived as having a racial problem. They simply didn’t know what to do about it.’ Henry was 15 when, in January 2007, he was set upon by a group of Asian youths who called themselves ‘Asian Invasion’. Henry had agreed to fight a boy ‘one on one’ to end the harassment he felt he and his friends were experiencing. Victim: Henry Webster with his mother Liz. Mr Webster was left with brain damage after the attack with a hammer by a gang of Asians . Henry – a 6ft 2ins rugby player who stood out because of his flaming red hair and strong stature – was punched, kicked and hit six times with a claw hammer in a vicious attack by the group that lasted about a minute. He suffered three skull fractures – the hammer went into the fluid around his brain – and he had surgery to save his life. Seven young men were convicted of wounding Henry with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm. Five were convicted of conspiracy. Another admitted violent disorder. They were given custodial sentences ranging from eight months to eight years. Others received suspended sentences of up to 18 months. Only four were pupils at the school. The court was told the conflicts at the school resembled something one might see in a Quentin Tarantino movie. Henry and his family accused the school of failing to discipline Asian pupils who abused or intimidated white classmates. In 2009 his family launched a High Court challenge claiming the school had been negligent, failed to maintain proper discipline or deal with racial tension. The school denied liability. In February 2010, Mr Justice Nicol rejected the family’s claims and said the school did not breach its duty to take reasonable care to keep Henry reasonably safe while on the premises. Following that ruling the Swindon Local Safeguarding Children Board commissioned a serious case review. Published in 2010, it found the school had failed to tackle escalating racial tensions between Asian and white teenagers – even after a riot on the playing fields. It found that not only should playground bullying be monitored for racism, but that schools should appoint ‘different race’ mentors for new pupils to help them settle in. And teachers should consult parents about whether their approaches to religious and cultural requirements are ‘continuously appropriate.’ Mrs Webster, 50, who runs a recruitment agency for domestic staff and nannies maintains that the school was responsible for Henry’s attack. ‘We were never able to see the full serious case review,’ she said. ‘There was something in there the authorities didn’t want me to see. ‘Had the integration of the Asian students been properly handled we are certain this attack would never have happened.’ Henry, 23, is now at university but Mrs Webster says he still suffers ‘fatigue problems’.","Tory MP Robert Buckland, 45, censured by tribunal following his intervention into an enquiry over an attack by 13 Asians on a white pupil .

Some of the priciest properties in Britain are found in this magnet for the rich and famous. So it will surprise some to learn that Hampstead Garden Suburb, a swathe of low-density early 20th Century housing that stretches as far as Golders Green, was built specifically to cater for people from all social classes and economic backgrounds. It occupies 243 acres bought from Eton College in 1906. Today, One Direction’s Harry Styles and TV hosts Jonathan Ross, Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan are among celebrity residents. Heath and home: The five-bedroom £3.65million Wyldes Farm feels rural yet is in the middle of London . Who knows what Raymond Unwin, the socialist architect who designed the suburb, would be thinking, particularly about the fact that Wyldes Farm, the Hampstead house where he lived, is on the market for £3.65 million – and that’s for just half of it. The house has five bedrooms and two reception rooms, and its location – with Hampstead Heath on its doorstep – starts to explain its asking price. It was built in the mid-1600s as a farmhouse. But by the end of the 18th Century Hampstead had become a fashionable place for artists and intellectuals, and home-owners began to let out rooms – including at Wyldes Farm. Landscape painters John Constable and William Collins (whose son Wilkie, the novelist, used to play in the garden as a child) lived in the house, as did the Romantic poet William Blake. It is also believed to have been used as a meeting place for members of the Fabian Society in the late 19th Century. But its most famous resident was Charles Dickens. In 1837, a distraught Dickens, then in his mid-20s, rented the property following the death of his sister-in-law Mary Hogarth. Airy: The modern kitchen is in a house full of historic features . At the time of his stay, Dickens was writing his first two major novels, The Pickwick Papers and Oliver Twist. They were written in instalments, because they were serialised in literary magazines. As he was working to tight deadlines, Dickens needed a secluded place to work, and he knew the area offered this because he had stayed there in his childhood when his father was trying to evade creditors. The house, which has two staircases, has plenty of features to remind you how it would have looked when Dickens was writing –  vaulted ceilings, panelled walls and exposed beams. Famous residents: Charles Dickens and romantic painter John Constable lived in the house . But it has been updated sufficiently to  provide a slick, modern environment. There’s a vast kitchen-dining area with an island workstation and a beautifully presented  en suite bathroom and dressing room for the master bedroom. Outside there are three sections of garden, each offering excellent entertainment space in the summer. Wyldes’s current owner, Yamuna Sharma, is selling because she and her husband plan to live abroad. She says the artistic tradition of the house has lived on. ‘Painters, musicians, actors, designers have continued to stay,’ she says. Indeed Sharma has recently rented out the house to a family with a strong connection to the arts. Her tenants, businessman Scott Finlay, 54, and teacher wife Catherine, 53, have seen their 21-year-old daughter, a film-maker, and 23-year-old son, an artist, develop their careers while living there. The three outbuildings have helped. The Finlays’ son has used one as a studio. Architect and poet: Sir Raymond Urwin who designed the suburb and romantic writer William Blake . Meanwhile their daughter drew inspiration from the filming of the recent British film about slavery – Belle – up the road at Kenwood House. Catherine says: ‘We have loved the house’s unique sense of history, and it’s magical living on the edge of the Heath.’ Gary Saunders, of estate agents Westways, says: ‘There’s been a great deal of interest. It is the first time the house has been on sale for 34 years, it has direct access to the Heath and is a gem of a property with a unique story.’ Westways.co.uk; 020 7286 5757 .","Five bedroom home in North London on the market for £3.65million .

Hundreds of British holidaymakers had their summer getaway plans needlessly disrupted yesterday after Heathrow Airport cancelled one in five flights for a storm that never happened. Forecasters warned of a thundery conditions sweeping through London between 4pm and 6pm, leading to the cancellation of more than 20 flights. Around 100 jets would normally take off from Heathrow during that period. But frustrated passengers – many with children – glared through the terminal windows at a cloudless sky. The deluge hit the West Country and the Midlands instead – more than a month’s rainfall fell in the regions yesterday. There were even tornados in some places. Scroll down for video . Deluge: A couple shelter from the rain on the beach in Brighton as rain swept through parts of the South East - missing out parts of London . Soaked: A Cambridge University student is forced to cover her head with a graduation gown while a woman in Brighton decides the rain will not dampen her spirits . The Gloucestershire village of Westonbirt was the wettest place in Britain, with 3in of rain falling in 11 hours. ‘More than half of that total fell between 9am and 11am,’ said Met Office forecaster Tom Morgan. ‘Almost one and a half times the average rainfall for the whole of July fell during the day.’ Patients on a cardiology ward at the Royal United Hospital in Bath were transferred after heavy rain brought down part of a ceiling at 2am. The 27 patients, who were all unharmed, were taken to other parts of the hospital. There was localised flooding and road closures due to the sudden downpours, and the Environment Agency issued 60 warnings across the South West and Midlands. Heavy rain also fell in Dorset, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and Worcestershire. The Environment Agency’s John Curtin said: ‘Intense heavy rainfall will bring surface water flood risk for England throughout the weekend.

Still catching the rays: A woman desperately tries to make the most of a hint of sun as she lies on the cobbles on Brighton beach . ‘Flooding can happen very quickly and the public are urged to keep checking local weather forecasts and the Environment Agency website for information.’ Meanwhile, freak hail storms hit Coventry, Derby and Sheffield, and there were reports of mini-tornados in Swindon. Manchester Airport said an electrical surge caused by thunderstorms had led to some minor delays. Throughout the UK there were 3,000 lightning strikes during just two hours in the early hours of yesterday. A family of four were made homeless after the roof of their semi-detached bungalow was set on fire by lightning in Holland-on-Sea, Essex. But as the wild weather continued to move north last night, the UK was still under a ‘yellow’ heatwave warning, advising people to be ‘alert and ready’. The Met Office said there was a 60 per cent chance of the heatwave continuing today, with temperatures predicted to cool gradually next week.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Second World War air raid shelter buried for more than 70 years has been discovered at a primary school by a pupil - and it was so well preserved the light bulb was still working. The iconic Anderson shelter was unearthed at Stoke Community Primary School, in Medway, Kent. Youngster Harvey Cotton, ten, had been taking part in a school activity when he saw a block of concrete at the back of what used to be an orchard in the school grounds. The Second World War shelter was so well preserved the light bulb was still working . School caretaker Chris Poulter was sent to investigate and was amazed at what he found. He said: 'We cleared away some of the vegetation and saw the steps down to the shelter. 'After more clearance work we were able to get to the entrance. It was bricked up most of the way and there was a wooden door behind it. 'We knocked through the bricks and it opened up into the shelter.' Once inside Chris and parent helper Martin Blackwell discovered a crate of dusty old milk bottles and other items that had lain untouched for decades. The pair were even more surprised when they ran an extension lead down to the shelter and switched on the light and the bulb still worked. It's thought the shelter was used during the Blitz by pupils at the school and local villagers from nearby Lower Stoke. School caretaker Chris Poulter was sent to investigate and was amazed at what he found. He is pictured with Harvey Cotton, left and another pupil at the entrance to the shelter . The school now plans to restore the shelter so it can be used for hands-on lessons about the Second World War. Volunteers from National Grid have agreed to connect a power supply and help with some of the clearance work to create better access to the shelter. Head teacher Anita Meggs said: 'We feel very privileged to have such a wonderful resource in the school grounds. 'There is so much history in the school, which has been here since the 1800s. In September we plan on doing a project on the Second World War that will run all term. 'We hope to use the shelter for lessons and invite older villagers, who may have used the shelter, into the school to tell their stories about the war.'","Second World War air raid shelter was buried for more than 70 years .

"Dozing teacher Sue Hall was given a parking fine after a warden ticketed her car while she sleeping inside. The 51-year-old fell asleep after dropping her daughter Lucy, 15, and a friend off at the gym and awoke to find the warden putting a £50 fine on her windscreen. Mrs Hall, from Southampton, said she was 'really tired' after a busy day at work when she fell asleep around 4pm. Sue Hall with the £50 parking fine she received while sleeping in her car as she waited for her daughter to finish at the gym; she had purchased an hours' parking but it had expired five minutes earlier . She had purchased an hour's parking and can't understand why the warden didn't simply wake her up to let her know it had expired. She said: 'I'm really angry about being given this ticket.' Mrs Hall said the sound of the ticket being placed on her windscreen woke her up. 'I couldn't believe it. Instead of waking me up, he had gone ahead and fined me. 'I got out of my car and said, 'What are you doing?' and he told me I had gone over my parking time by five minutes.' Mrs Hall, who is appealing the ticket, can't understand why the parking warden didn't simply wake her up to tell her that her parking had expired . Mrs Hall said she asked the warden why . he didn't wake her and he replied that he wasn't sure if he had even . noticed she was in the car. She said: 'He had the attitude that rules were rules and walked off.' Mrs Hall said she accepts her allotted time had expired, but believes the warden could have been more considerate. She said: 'It's the principle of the thing I'm furious about. 'To me, parking tickets are supposed to be given for illegal or inappropriate parking, not making money out of things this. 'I don't know if the parking attendants have a quota of tickets to fill. I do everything to avoid getting a ticket because I can't stand getting them.'

"By . David Kent . Former Liverpool winger Ryan Babel has sparked speculation that he could make a return to the club after posting on his official Twitter account that he was on his way to Merseyside. The 27-year-old still remains a popular figure among the Liverpool faithful after proving to be a useful squad player during his four years at the club. Since leaving the Reds in 2011 the Holland forward has since gone on to play for 1889 Hoffenheim and Ajax, as well as his current side Kasımpaşa S.K.

Experience: Babel has played for some of the biggest clubs in the world during his career . Babel is arguably still in his peak and could still have his best years ahead of him after struggling over the past few seasons. With that in mind he could still be worth taking a look at if Brendan Rodgers is keen on adding a utility forward to his ranks, with Babel's pace and keen eye for goal his key attributes to watch out for. Elsewhere, Liverpool have agreed a fee of £8.5 million for QPR striker Loic Remy. The Frenchman scored 15 goals in 30 appearances on loan at Newcastle last season, and with Luis Suarez departing Anfield for Barcelona, Brendan Rodgers views the 27-year-old as the ideal replacement for him.","The former Liverpool forward posted a message on Twitter to say he was on route to Merseyside .

"By . Hector Nunns . Kostas Stafylidis can help Fulham banish the memories of last season’s Greek tragedy. The marauding left-back, picked up by Felix Magath on loan from Bayer Leverkusen, was the star of the show for the Championship side at League One Crawley. And the impressive display of Stafylidis, 20, was in stark contrast to record signing and £12.4million flop Konstantinos Mitroglou last season. Greek success: Kostas Stafylidis (second right) scored and assisted during Fulham's 2-0 victory at Crawley . Fresh start: Fulham boss Felix Magath hopes to get promoted back to the Premier League at the first attempt . Plagued by injuries World Cup misfit Mitroglou made little contribution as Fulham slumped out of the Premier League - and now seems certain to leave. But playing almost as a left winger compatriot Stafylidis cracked in a 20-yard angled drive for the opener and then teed up Colombian striker Hugo Rodallega for the second. Scotland assistant boss Mark McGhee, once tipped to team up with Magath, arrived to check on Fulham’s £11m man Ross McCormack – but was left disappointed. The 27-year-old international, short of match fitness after missing out on a full pre-season following his move from Leeds, did not feature. Veteran Danish keeper Brian Jensen, known as ‘The Beast’ and signed this summer by Crawley boss John Gregory, pulled off smart saves to deny Rodallega and Lasse Vigen Christiansen.

On the hour Crawley gave a run-out to triallist and former Fulham Premier League forward Collins John.

"By . Nick Craven And Ross Slater . A cemetery where bodies were buried in the wrong place, plots mis-sold and graves illegally opened was callously referred to as a ‘Bermuda Triangle’ by local councillors, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. The most shocking mix-up in a catalogue of blunders resulted in grieving parents learning that for months they had been leaving flowers on the wrong grave. Colin and Ann Milligan discovered to their dismay that their son Michael had not been buried in the plot they had bought for him but in a grave nearby, while his headstone had been mistakenly erected at a third site. Painful: Colin Milligan, pictured, leaves flowers at his son Michael's grave . A new investigation by council officials into the idyllic Arnside Cemetery in Cumbria has found other alarming examples of incompetence, including: . The Milligans said they had bought a specific plot for their severely disabled son, who died aged 27 in 1994, partly because they had also been able to purchase the one next-door so  they could eventually be buried alongside him. Mix up: The cemetery sign at Arnside Cemetery in Cumbria . But the couple were unexpectedly summoned to the cemetery about six months after their son’s death and told there had been a shocking mix-up. They were shown their son’s actual grave, which had been opened up without the required legal licence, and asked to check the coffin’s nameplate, which they verified  was Michael’s. The burying of ‘poor’ children in mass graves was once commonplace. Although now shocking, it remains legal and there have been frequent calls to ban the practice. The payment of even a token fee would ensure parents know where their child is interred so that they can later erect  a memorial, however simple. The couple said that not only was their son in a different plot from the one they had officially purchased, but the confusion meant they could no longer be buried alongside the son they had devoted their lives to. To add insult to injury, they learned Michael’s headstone had been wrongly placed at yet another grave, occupied by a woman’s body, and had to be moved to their son’s plot. Mrs Milligan, 71, a retired cleaner, said: ‘When I went up there, I had to walk away. It was very distressing. It was his coffin but it was not in  the plot we had bought. It felt like Michael was still not at rest. ‘We had bought the plots to be side by side but it turned out those plots we bought were already occupied and the space he is in only has room for us at the foot of it.’ Her husband, 72, a former electricity worker, said: ‘It has been very painful for my wife especially. ‘It was nothing sinister, just someone who had taken on too much and couldn’t cope with all the different responsibilities.’ An examination of the cemetery’s records, which were in a chaotic state, has found that several other people were listed as being buried in the wrong plots, and gravestones erected at the wrong sites. Tragic: Arnside Cemetery's unmarked child graves . The council’s inquiry also discovered that 42 babies and young children had been buried up to the 1970s in mass ‘public’ graves where no record was taken of exactly where the body lay – a practice still used in some cemeteries. The graveyard’s chaotic past has only now been cleared up, after the appointment of a new official, and the parish council last week discussed issuing a public apology. In a statement, new Arnside  parish council chairman Elaine Wood said: ‘There have been serious issues. 'People have been interred in the wrong graves, headstones wrongly placed and registers have been altered. Colin and Ann Milligan’s disabled son Michael, 27, died in 1994, and his parents bought two plots side by side, numbered 465 and 464 for him and (a double) for themselves in Arnside Cemetery, Cumbria. But because of chaotic record-keeping, plot 465 already had a body in it and, in any case, Michael was erroneously interred in plot 468. Colin and Ann Milligan with Michael, bottom right, and older son Peter . Though the Milligans put flowers on 465, they were soon told by another mourner they were mistaken. A headstone for Michael was then somehow wrongly placed at plot 482, but later moved to where Michael actually was. The Milligans were summoned to the cemetery to find grave 468 had been illegally opened so that the coffin nameplate of their son could be verified. 'A grave was opened without a precautionary licence and without notice a family member asked to attend. ‘Records exist verifying the council was aware of the situation; it was also sometimes referred to at meetings and in the registers as the “Bermuda Triangle”. ‘This disrespectful term has now been removed from the records wherever possible.’","Investigation uncovers alarming examples of incompetence at Arnside Cemetery in Cumbria .

If Jodie Williams forgets the dark moments amid the joy of being back to her best for the Commonwealth Games, a quick glance at her wrists will remind her. ‘Pain is temporary’ is inked on the left, ‘Victory is forever’ on the right. ‘It’s quite ironic really as it’s one of the most painful parts to get tattooed,’ says the English sprinter before explaining the significance. ‘When things are tough, it feels like the whole world is against you and you can’t see a way out. But when you’re standing on top of the podium you aren’t thinking about the struggles, you’re just thinking how amazing that moment is. The hard times don’t last forever.’ Fulfilling her potential: British sprinter Jodie Williams feels she is finally starting to display her promise . Frustrating: Williams had difficult 2012 and 2013 seasons as she struggled to step-up to senior level . Williams had the tattoo done a year ago after an underwhelming 2013 season. It had been scarcely better than 2012 when her dream of competing at a home Olympics ended at the trials in Birmingham. She finished in a crumpled heap halfway down the track, sobbing with the pain of a pulled hamstring. Williams said: ‘Physically your body heals quite quickly and it wasn’t such a serious injury that I had to take a lot of time out but I had a few small injuries one after another and it almost feels like everyone’s against you and you’re never going to come back. I was fit during 2013 but I was still struggling massively with my confidence. ‘I’ve always been quite against sport psychologists because I’m not very good at discussing things. It was just about getting races under my belt so it took me a long time but each time I was chipping away at it and slowly exorcising those demons.’ Reminder: Williams has 'pain is temporary' and 'victory is forever' tattooed on her wrists . Williams burst onto the international sprinting scene at 15 when she won the 100m and 200m titles at the World Youth Championships. After going unbeaten over five years in 151 races as a junior she was nicknamed ‘money legs’ by those who predicted she would race to riches. Even her former coach Mike McFarlane said his charge, then 16, could be ‘the best athlete in the world if we box clever’. Williams is now starting to show the same promise as a senior. At the Glasgow Diamond League last week, she recorded the fourth- fastest 200m by a British female, clocking 22.60sec — knocking 0.16sec off her personal best and announcing herself as a medal contender at the Commonwealth Games. It is easy to forget she is still only 20. ‘It would be great if people could bear that in mind,’ she says. ‘People generally think I’m 23 or 24 and when I correct them and tell them this is only my second year as a senior they’re surprised. Success: Williams ran the fourth-fastest time by a British female in the 200m in Glasgow last week . ‘It’s only after having those years out that I’ve looked back and thought “Wow, there was a big thing about me around at that time, a big buzz, and that was an awful lot of pressure to be dealing with at a young age”. ‘Some people wrote me off very quickly but it takes a little while to translate to the seniors. I’ve still hopefully got a good five years until I reach my peak.’ Williams’s victory in the national trials in Birmingham this month prompted her to say: ‘I finally feel I’m mentally back to the athlete I was. I wanted to be Olympic champion. Because I was so young I had no fear, I thought anything was within my grasp. As I got older I lost that but I think it’s what made me the athlete I was and I’m getting that back now.’ Dip: Williams endured a difficult 2012 and 2013 but she believes she is over that blip now .","Williams has 'pain is temporary' and 'victory is forever' inked on her wrists .

"By . Sophie Freeman . A new study has found women who drink three sugary drinks a week increase their risk of suffering breast cancer . Women who have more than three sugary drinks a week may have an increased risk of developing breast cancer, a study has found. Researchers found that the more sugary drinks consumed by the women in their study, the greater the density of their breasts - a known risk factor for cancer. Dense breasts have less fatty tissue and more of the gland tissue that makes and drains milk as well as supportive tissue that surrounds the gland. Women with dense breasts have a higher risk of developing cancer because there are more cells that can become cancerous. Their cancers are also more likely to be missed because any areas of abnormal tissue are harder to spot during mammogram screening. Lead author of the study, Dr Caroline Diorio from Laval University in Quebec, said: ‘We know that worldwide consumption of sugar has increased and the findings of this study show what effect that type of diet could have on breast density, one of the strongest indicators for breast cancer risk.’ For the study, 1,555 women - half of whom were pre-menopausal and half of whom were postmenopausal - answered a questionnaire about how often they drank sugar-sweetened fruit juice and fizzy drinks. A serving was 355ml, about the size of a normal can of fizzy drink. Their breast density was then measured through mammogram screening. Dr Diorio said: ‘Among all women, those who had a sugary drink intake of more than three servings per week had a mean of 29.6 per cent in breast density but those who did not drink this type of drink had a mean of 26.2 per cent in breast density. ‘An increase of about three per cent in breast density is not negligible in terms of breast cancer risk. ‘By comparison it has been shown that healthy women at high risk of developing breast cancer who received (the breast cancer drug) tamoxifen for four-and-a-half years had a reduction of 6.4 per cent in breast density, and it has been observed that tamoxifen can reduce the risk of breast cancer by 30-50 per cent in high-risk women.’ Experts believe sugar can enhance cell growth, and therefore the density of breast tissue. Women with dense breasts have a higher risk of developing cancer because there are more cells that can become cancerous . It’s thought that sugar can enhance cell growth, and therefore, density in breast tissue. Dr Diorio concluded: ‘Considering the worldwide increase in sugar consumption and all the health problems it is related to, it is important to continue research on this subject and begin to inform the public about the adverse effects of sugar consumption.’ The study was published in the journal BMC Public Health. A new piece of research at the University of Illinois has found IVF drugs do not cause breast or gynecological cancers . Fertility drugs do not trigger cancer in women trying to get pregnant, says new research. A US study of almost 10,000 women suggests hormonal drugs and other medication do not raise the overall risk of breast, ovarian and womb cancers. The exception is women who remained childless despite having drugs called gonadotrophins as part of IVF treatment. But experts believe the extra risk is caused by underlying health problems responsible for the infertility. Debate has raged about whether IVF drugs may cause cancer because they stimulate hormones linked to the disease, especially breast cancer. A new study looked back at 9,892 women treated for infertility between 1965 and 1988 at five US centres, and followed them for 30 years for data on cancer. Altogether 749 breast cancers, 119 womb cancers and 85 ovarian cancers were found. Using a popular fertility drug called clomiphene was not linked with breast, womb or ovarian cancers. A small number of women treated with the drug for at least a year had a 69 per cent higher risk of breast cancer, but only 31 women fell into this category. Experts said current guidelines recommended just three to six months of treatment. Dr Bert Scoccia from the University of Illinois, Chicago, presented the data today at the Annual Meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) in Munich. He said the results were ‘generally reassuring’. There was a higher cancer risk for women treated with newer fertility hormones known as gonadotrophins who remained childless. But, said Dr Scoccia, only 13 women were in this category and it was likely the increased risk was caused by their severe infertility ‘rather than that of drug usage.’ Richard Kennedy general secretary of the International Federation of Fertility Societies, said ‘Cancer risks of drugs used to stimulate egg production have been evaluated in a number of national studies and not found to significantly increase the risk, other than that which relates to the underlying risks in this patient group. ‘This study does not change the current recommendation to patients that the risks are low but that clomiphene should generally not be used for more than 12 cycles.’ The study based on 30 years of research found 'little evidence' women treated using conventional fertility hormones for ovarian stimulation increased the long-term risk of breast and gynecological cancers.

"By . Brad Gilbert . We are not quite halfway through Wimbledon — thanks to your quaint Sunday off — and although they have had their setbacks, the men’s Big Four are sitting pretty. Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic will be happy as they are not affected by the delay caused by Saturday’s weather, which sees Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer facing four matches in six days. I am still fairly confident that two of my pre-tournament favourites, Murray and Maria Sharapova, are in good shape to emerge as champions. My guy: Andy Murray looks in good shape to emerge as champion for the second time at Wimbledon . Practice: Murray has been in great shape, hasn't slipped and looks set to go all the way at SW19 . My other choice: As does Maria Sharapova, practicing on the Sunday off of Wimbledon . Andy, my one-time pupil, impressed me in week one and although he takes a step up today against Kevin Anderson I am sure he can handle it. The South African goes big on both first and second serves but Andy’s returns have been coming right out of the middle of his racket. Amelie Mauresmo seems to be doing a good job as his coach and I am sure she will agree that a key aspect is to keep Anderson moving and off balance because he is a lethal power hitter if allowed. He does not like long rallies and will try to hit winners from all over. My hunch is that there will be at least one close set, possibly two, but that Murray will prevail. My impression is that Djokovic is moving better than last year and that is crucial to his chances. Four matches in six days is a challenge for Federer but I have liked what I have seen so far and his serve has been outstanding. I expected Nadal to have a tough first week but the the court should turn more in his favour as the week goes on. Big hit: Four matches in six days is a challenge for Roger Federer but he's looked impressive so far . Preparation: Rafael Nadal has had a tough week but still remains on top and it should turn in his favour . The serious danger comes from Grigor Dimitrov and Milos Raonic. Dimitrov’s game is made for grass and I have always had him pencilled in for a possible quarter-final against Murray. Raonic has been the most improved player on grass I have seen this year. As for that serve — you could spend a week playing him and not manage to break. Nobody has done it so far. Serena Williams’ defeat by 24th seed Alize Cornet was a real shock and the fact that the top two women’s seeds have gone out of the first week in the past two Slams suggests a changing of the guard. Former champion Chris Evert told me that when you get into your 30s there are days when your body just feels a bit flat. Well, Serena is 33 in September — and she is human, too. Now Sharapova should benefit. It would also be a great story if Caroline Wozniacki was to come through. I don’t like the way she is constantly asked about her private life so it would be a great response. Bonus: It would be a good story if Caroline Wozniacki was to come through in a rousing response .","The men's Big Four - Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer - are sitting pretty at SW19 .

"By . Jim Van Wijk, Press Association . Olympic judo silver medallist Gemma Gibbons admits it will be somewhat surreal fighting for gold at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow on the same day as her husband Euan Burton - but intends to ensure bragging rights for England when they get back home. Gibbons' emotional semi-final victory at ExCeL, when she paid tribute to her late mother, was one of the most memorable moments of London 2012. However, the 27-year-old - who suffered a broken thumb en route to her Olympic success - has only recently returned to the Tatami following a terrible run of fitness problems which included a fractured wrist, shoulder reconstruction surgery and ankle issues. Silver lining: Gemma Gibbons kisses her medal after winning it at London 2012 . Rivals: Gibbons will be competing for England, whilst husband Euan Burton will represent Scotland in Glasgow . After being drafted into a 14-strong Team England squad following injury to another Glasgow hopeful, Edinburgh-based Gibbons is determined to make the most of her opportunity to show her true talents once again. Gibbons and Burton - one of Scotland's leading medal hopes after deciding to take up a place at under-100kgs in the team he helps coach - are both set to fight on the final day of competition at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre next weekend, with judo back in the Commonwealth Games for the first time since Manchester 2002. 'I have never competed for Team England before, it has always been Great Britain, and that is the same for Euan, and we are set to compete on the same day. 'It will be strange, but also quite cool because I don't think there are many other athletes out there that get to say they are competing in a Commonwealth Games with their husband, but for different teams,' she said. 'Even though I am competing for Team England, I live in Scotland now and train up there full-time as well, so it will feel like a home games for me.' Gibbons added: 'I had not competed on the international stage in about nine months, and as any athlete knows, if you have had that amount of time off, then it takes another good couple of months to get your fitness back, especially with a sport like judo, which is so technical. 'You just have to keep going through the injuries, getting back on the mat and turning up for training. It is more the stuff like the rehab which takes it out of you mentally. 'But I fully believe I am the best player in that weight category and believe I can win. 'I am going for the gold, nothing else is going to be good enough for me, that is my goal.' Emotion: Gibbons crying after she guarantees herself a medal during 2012 victory . Nippon: The moment she defeated France's Audrey Tcheumeo to secure silver . Burton, born in Ascot, Berkshire, but raised in Edinburgh, endured starkly different emotions at the London Olympics, following a bitterly disappointing first-round exit when he had targeted a place on the podium. The 35-year-old, once ranked in the top four at half-middleweight and a twice former world championship bronze medallist, opted to fill a vacant slot on the JudoScotland squad for Glasgow at under-100kgs - which comes with its own hazards. 'He stepped up from under-81kgs, but at under-90kgs, Scotland have a lot of good fighters. However, at the weight above, they have only got one and you can take two in each weight,' Gibbons explained. 'As Euan is a coach at JudoScotland now, he was like ""there is no way I can actually take someone's spot. I don't feel comfortable with that"" - so now he is fighting some monsters. 'When he was at a tournament in South America, he was in the final against a big Brazilian and got thrown so hard on the back of his head he was knocked out, but he is big guy and can look after himself. 'I am not worried because we both know what judo is like and you very rarely get serious injuries and is a sport we both love doing. 'He will be fine - I just have to stuff him full of burgers to get his weight up before fights.'","Gibbons after gold in Glasgow at Commonwealth Games .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Once considered a pioneering technology, plasma TVs have been delivered another nail in the coffin. Samsung has become the latest manufacturer to announce it will be shutting down its plasma panel business, effective from 30 November. According to reports, the South Korean firm blamed the decline in ‘overall demand for plasma televisions’ for its decision. Samsung announced it will shut down its plasma panel business on 30 November, blaming the decline in 'overall demand for plasma televisions'. The 51-inch F8500 (pictured) will be one of the last Samsung models to feature the technology . Samsung told MailOnline: 'We plan to continue our PDP TV business until the end of this year, due to changes in market demands. 'We remain committed to providing consumers with products that meet their needs, and will increase our focus on growth opportunities in UHD TV’s and Curved TV’s.' Panasonic announced last October that it was scrapping the technology, and production ended in March. Plasma displays use tiny gas cells placed between two panes of glass. Each . cell acts like a mini fluorescent tube, emitting ultraviolet light . which then strikes red, green and blue glowing spots on the screen. By . comparison, liquid crystal display (LCD) TVs use light from behind the . screen that is shone through coloured liquid crystal cells. Signals control each cell, letting varying amounts of colour through to build up the picture. LED televisions work in a similar way to LCD technology, but tiny LEDs, rather than backlight lamps, illuminate the cells. OLED (organic light-emitting . diode) screens are similar to LED, but are more equipped to handling 4K, or . ultra-high-definition. This leaves LG as the last major manufacturer of plasma displays. According to Cnet, Samsung’s vice president of Visual Display R&D office, John Ryu, hinted that the end was nigh for plasma last year. Ryu said he didn't think plasma had a future beyond 2014, because it was difficult to make an affordable 4K version of the technology. Fujitsu produced the first full-colour plasma display panel in 1992, and Philips sold the first models to consumers in 1997, for $15,000 (£8,700). Plasma displays use tiny gas cells placed between two panes of glass. Each cell acts like a small fluorescent tube, emitting ultraviolet light, which then strikes red, green and blue glowing spots on the screen. The news follows Panasonic's decision to stop producing the panel displays in its own range of televisions (TCP42X1 is pictured) as of March this year, leaving LG as the last major manufacturer of plasma displays . By comparison, liquid crystal display (LCD) TVs use light from behind the screen that is shone through coloured liquid crystal cells. Signals control each cell, letting varying amounts of colour through to build up the picture. LED televisions work in a similar way to LCD technology, but tiny LEDs, rather than backlight lamps, illuminate the cells. Traditionally, plasma TVs were bulky, while LCD and LED were much thinner, and the latter overtook sales of the former from 2006. Plasma also can’t compete with the likes of OLED (organic light-emitting diode) screens, especially those that can handle 4K, or ultra-high-definition, pictures that have four times the pixels of Full HD.","Samsung said it will shut down its plasma business by 30 November .

"By . Sophie Borland . 'Time for action': Dr Clifford Mann said the report recommendations must be acted on . Out-of-hours GPs should be installed in every A&E department to help deal with the soaring number of patients, a report by experts has recommended. They would be given the job of  assessing patients upon arrival to decide in what order they should be treated and deal with any less urgent cases. Since 2004, family doctors have been allowed to opt out of working evenings and weekends and subcontract the care to private firms, which offer a patchy service. And last year a total of 21.7million patients attended casualty, a rise of 50 per cent over the past decade. The increase has been partly blamed on the failings of GPs’ out-of-hours services – a problem which has seen patients turning up at A&E departments when they don’t know where else to go. Now a joint report from the College of Emergency Medicine – which represents A&E doctors – the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal College of Surgeons and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has listed a series of recommendations to address the rise in demand. The report warns that A&E units are becoming steadily more overwhelmed, particularly in winter when there is a surge in very ill patients. It calls for A&E units to be able to draft in doctors from other wards during very busy periods. Sir Richard Thompson, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said: ‘Over the past few years, services for ill patients have been stretched by the sheer amount of acute and emergency admissions. ‘We have to plan better for the future to protect patient safety. If we do not implement them, then we shall simply walk blindfold into another winter crisis.’ And Dr Clifford Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, said: ‘It would be nothing short of a scandal if these recommendations were not acted on. The time for action is now.’ Stretched: Last year a total of 21.7million patients attended casualty, a rise of 50 per cent over the last decade. The rise has been partly attributed to patients turning up at A&E when they have nowhere else to go . The report sets out 13 recommendations to address the challenges facing urgent and emergency care services across the UK and Ireland. As well as out-of-hours family doctors, they said there should also be other health and social care workers in emergency departments to bridge the gap between GPs, hospitals and social care services in order to support vulnerable patients. Aggressive sales reps who pester new mothers into buying their products face being banned from maternity wards. Parenting . promotions firm Bounty pays the NHS £2.3million a year to get access to . maternity wards, where they sell products including high chairs, prams . and car seats. The sales reps collect women’s names and addresses and . often pass them on to other companies. But now the Care Quality . Commission (CQC) will check whether Bounty staff are invading women’s . privacy during hospital inspections. It will inform hospital bosses of . any concerns – who could decide to ban the representatives from the . premises. Professor Sir Mike Richards, CQC’s Chief Inspector of . Hospitals, said: ‘Women who have recently given birth have a right to . privacy and their dignity must be respected.’ They also said that community care and social care should be available seven days a week to support urgent and emergency care services, which would mean that patients could be safely discharged outside of normal working hours. Dr Stephanie Smith of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said: ‘Emergency departments are being put under increased pressure as staff are faced with a growing number of patients who are either unable to access out-of-hours care or who see the emergency departments as their “go-to” for all health complaints.’ She added: ‘What we need to do now, and as today’s report highlights, is have better access to out-of-hours primary care, provide doctors with appropriate training and access to advice from paediatricians and have more effective and consistent advice and information sharing between healthcare professionals to reduce unnecessary admissions.’ But Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the Council of the British Medical Association, warned that implementing the recommendations would be expensive. He said: ‘The system needs to be properly funded, fully resourced and adequately staffed. ‘It is crucial that patients are treated in the most appropriate setting, and receive the correct advice and care the first time around.’","Family doctors are allowed to opt out of working evenings and weekends .

"By . Sophie Borland . Calling for change: Dr Alison Cook of the Alzheimer's Society said making good choices later in life was 'critical' The middle-aged are to be warned by GPs not to share a bottle of wine a night because they think they have ‘earned a rest’. Guidelines from the health watchdog NICE tells doctors to urge patients in their 50s and 60s to take more exercise, lose weight and cut back on alcohol to prevent dementia and other illnesses. Importantly, GPs will be told to inform patients that even sticking within the Government’s safe alcohol guidelines of two units a day for women and three for men raises the risk of future illness. A typical bottle of wine contains ten units of alcohol. The guidelines also state there is ‘no safe level of alcohol consumption’. There is growing evidence that many illnesses such as dementia, heart disease, certain cancers and diabetes are strongly linked to lifestyles. Only yesterday research published by Cambridge University found that a third of all Alzheimer’s cases could be linked to behaviours such as lack of exercise, obesity and smoking. NICE warns middle-aged adults have far worse lifestyles than older or younger generations and tend to drink heavily, be overweight and have raised cholesterol and blood pressure. In guidelines issued yesterday, it tells GPs to urge patients to change their behaviours during routine appointments or the three-yearly NHS health check-ups, offered to all those aged 40 to 74. Specifically, patients will be encouraged to cut back on alcohol as much as possible over concerns that it is the ‘norm’ in middle age to drink daily at home. They will also be urged to ask patients about their sleeping patterns over concerns not getting enough increases the risk of dementia, heart disease and diabetes. Patients will also be told to take up gardening, walking, cycling or even a new sport particularly if retirement means they have more time on their hands. But the guidelines add that patients should not assume middle-age is a time for ‘slowing down’ and assuming they have ‘earned a rest’. Sharing a bottle of wine after work simply because it felt like it has been earned could put you at risk of disease later in life . Professor . Mike Kelly, director of NICE’s Centre of Public Health, said: ‘The good . news is we are living longer, but these extra years are not always spent . in good health. Ill health and dependency are not inevitable . consequences of old age. ‘The risk . of developing dementia, disability and frailty can be reduced. Everyone . now understands that smoking, drinking too much alcohol, being inactive . or overweight can seriously damage your health, but what many don’t . realise is these factors also increase the likelihood of them developing . dementia. ‘Obviously the earlier in life that healthy changes are made the better, but it’s never too late to start.’ The guidelines highlight figures showing women aged 65 to 74 and men aged 55 to 64 are the unhealthiest of all groups. Nearly . one in six women aged 65 to 74 have four or more bad habits that put . them at risk of poor future health including smoking, obesity, not . exercising and having a poor diet. And one in five men aged 55 to 64 . have four or more. Dr Alison Cook, of the Alzheimer’s Society, said: Making good choices later in life is critical.’ The NHS is denying surgery to patients who aren’t deemed to be suffering enough pain, according to a report. Nearly . three-quarters of GP-led local health authorities – known as Clinical . Commissioning Groups – enforce ‘arbitrary rules’ to determine which . patients can undergo treatments such as hip replacements and hernia . repair. A number refuse to take out children’s tonsils unless . parents can prove they are frequently off sick from school or that the . pain is affecting their learning. The report, by the Royal College . of Surgeons, shows many of the groups, which were set up last year, are . ignoring NHS guidelines and imposing their own ‘unethical’ restrictions. Last night Clare Marx, president of the Royal . College of Surgeons, added: ‘This report seems to show local . commissioners are imposing arbitrary rules governing access to some . routine surgery.’","Health watchdog urges patients in their 50s and 60s to take more exercise, lose weight and cut back on alcohol to prevent dementia and other illnesses .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . The largest bird that ever flew, which had a staggering 24ft (7 metre) wingspan, was so heavy it would have had to take off like a hang glider. Computer simulations have revealed that the prehistoric condor-like Pelagornis sandersi could only have left the ground by taking a running jump downhill into a headwind. But once airborne, it would have been a highly efficient flyer, despite its extraordinary wingspan being more than twice that of the albatross - the world’s largest flying bird today. This graphic shows how the enormous 'condor', which lived 28 million years ago, compares to modern-day birds, including the albatross, eagle, vulture, gull and sparrow. The Pelagornis sandersi is a species of pelagornithid - an extinct group of giant seabirds believed to be ancestors of pelicans and storks . Working from a fossil skull, as well as wing and leg bones, researchers calculated the likely size of the bird, and modelled possible flight styles - including flapping and gliding. The fossil of the prehistoric flyer was unearthed in 1983, in . South Carolina. It was found when construction workers began digging a new terminal at . the Charleston International Airport, and was so big they had to remove it using a JCB. Working from a fossil skull, as well as . wing and leg bones, researchers calculated the likely size of the bird . and modelled possible flight styles - including flapping and gliding. Even though it would have weighed up to 180lbs (81.5kg), the researchers said they have no doubt P sandersi flew. Its . paper-thin hollow bones, stumpy legs and wing shape made it similar to . birds that fly today, and this would have made it awkward when on land. Its size and telltale beak suggested the creature was a previously unknown . species of pelagornithid - an extinct group of giant seabirds believed . to be ancestors of pelicans and storks. They . were known for bony ‘teeth’ that lined their jaws. These giants of the sky occurred all . over the globe for tens of millions of years but vanished during the . Pliocene - just three million years ago. Even though it would have weighed up to 180lbs (81.5kg), the researchers said they have no doubt P sandersi flew.

But, because it exceeded the 15ft (4.5 metre) wingspan previous studies have claimed is the maximum for birds to fly, the researchers were unsure how it managed to take off and stay aloft. The fossil was unearthed in 1983 in South Carolina when construction workers began digging a new terminal at the Charleston International Airport. It was so big they had to remove it using a JCB. Dr Dan Ksepka, curator of science at Bruce Museum in Connecticut, said: 'The upper wing bone alone was longer than my arm.' Its sheer size and telltale beak suggested the creature was a previously unknown species of pelagornithid - an extinct group of giant seabirds believed to be ancestors of pelicans and storks. They were known for bony ‘teeth’ that lined their jaws, according to the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

It would have occasionally swooped down to the water to feed on soft-bodied prey, such as squid and eels. The skeleton was very well preserved - a rarity because of the paper-thin nature of the bones in these birds. Dr Ksepka said: 'Pelagornithids were like creatures out of a fantasy novel - there is simply nothing like them around today.' These giants of the sky occurred all over the globe for tens of millions of years but vanished during the Pliocene - just three million years ago. Paleontologists remain uncertain about the cause of their demise.

"By . Mark Staniforth, Press Association . Hull captain Curtis Davies is happy to follow the example set by his manager and do the dirty work if it means his side pull off a major upset and lift the FA Cup for the first time in their history at Wembley on Saturday. Davies was just five years old when Bruce started his first FA Cup final against Crystal Palace, but grew up as a big Manchester United fan and came to emulate Bruce's uncompromising attitude to his craft. And despite the plaudits heaped on the 29-year-old this season, Davies insists he will be content for his team-mates to go down as heroes so long as the Tigers can emulate Wigan's unexpected cup win last May. Celebration: Davies says winning at Wembley on Saturday would be the greatest achievement of his career . Learning from the master: Davies (right) is hoping to emulate his manager, who won the cup as a player . Davies said: 'I'd sooner our striker is man of the match for scoring a hat-trick than a defender for making last-ditch tackles every two minutes to keep us in the game.' Recalling his days watching Bruce and his central-defensive partner Gary Pallister during their Old Trafford era, Davies said: 'I have lots of memories of Manchester United finals and I remember him playing and lifting the trophy as captain, and that's something I want to emulate. 'He was a hard man, the tough one and Pallister was meant to be the ball player as such. 'I probably have a mix of the two. I'm quite long and gangly like Pallister was, and I guess he was the quick one out of the two. 'But I can definitely do the dirty and ugly side of defending because if you've played in League One there's not a week goes by where you can get away without getting hurt, and luckily I got used to that early in my career. Optimistic: the Hull captains believes his team can win and says if they do it would be 'the stuff of dreams' Captain fantastic: The defender has been in superb form this season as Hull secured their top flight status . 'You can have ball-playing defenders who rarely put in a tackle, but clubs like ourselves need proper dogged defenders who can put their bodies on the line. That's the sort of player I am rather than the creative, unlocking player.' Davies has been the undoubted star of the Tigers' first season back in the top-flight and was widely credited with turning the semi-final against Sheffield United on its head with an impassioned half-time team-talk. Such headline-grabbing interventions are a far cry from Davies' early career, having worked his way up through the lower leagues where he started with Luton, the club who gave him his first professional contract in 2003. Two years later Davies helped the Hatters to the League One title - an achievement he will still regard as the proudest moment of his career until he leads his side out in the Wembley final. Davies added: 'If we win it, it will be the biggest achievement of my career without a doubt. Up to now, my best achievement was winning the League One title with Luton. Preparation: Davies (centre) shares a joke with Aluko (right) and Livermore during training . Career highlight: The Hull fans salute Davies after reaching the cup final by beating Sheffield United . 'I still believe that was a great achievement, but to win the FA Cup is the stuff of dreams. 'It might be a great day out but if you don't win it it means nothing to you. You just hope the walk up the steps is a happy one, especially with me being captain and potentially lifting the trophy. 'People keep saying the FA Cup's lost a bit of gloss but as an Englishman and a fan it's still the best competition. 'I always dreamed of lifting it for Man U back then, and if you'd told me I would get a chance to play in an FA Cup final I would have run around like a madman. 'The fact that it is now reality that I could lift the trophy is crazy.'","Central defender Davies looking to manager Steve Bruce for inspiration .

"By . Associated Press . A flight carrying 59 women and  children arrived Friday in Honduras from New Mexico, the second group of migrants from the Central American country to be deported from the United States this week. Nun Valdette Willeman welcomed the 33 children and 26 women at San Pedro Sula airport's Center for Returned Migrants. 'All the children came accompanied by their mother, none of them traveled alone,' Willeman said. She said there is a playground for the children and a place for their parents to clean up and get ready before continuing to their hometowns by bus. Each child received a small backpack with crayons, and their mothers about $24 for travel expenses. Scroll down for video . Return: Immigration and Custom officials standby as a woman and child, who were deported from the United States, deplane at the San Pedro Sula airport in Honduras . A girl, deported from the United States, walks to board a bus that will take her to the Center for Migrants Returned, upon her arrival at the airport in San Pedro Sula on Friday . Several of the women said they had mixed emotions about failing to stay in the United States and that they now worry about paying back the thousands of dollars they borrowed to travel north. 'Part of my heart stayed in the U.S. because I missed a chance to get ahead in life,' said Isabel Rodriguez, who was deported along with her 2-year-old boy and 8-year-old daughter. 'The most important thing is that I'm with my children,' she added. Another woman who wouldn't give her name said she still owes about $7,200 she borrowed to pay the smuggler. On Monday, about 40 Honduran migrants detained in New Mexico were deported to their home country. The U.S. Border Patrol has detained fewer unaccompanied children entering South Texas illegally in the past 10 days, agency officials said Thursday. In recent months, the Border Patrol's facilities in South Texas have been overwhelmed by a surge in the number of children entering the country without their parents. More than 57,000 children have been arrested since October, more than double the number compared to a year earlier. The Border Patrol's Rio Grande Valley sector Chief Kevin Oaks made the comment about declining child arrests following a media tour of a new processing facility for them in McAllen. The 55,000-square-foot converted warehouse is scheduled to open Friday and temporarily house as many as 1,000 children until they can be turned over to the Health and Human Services Department and sent to shelters. 'We arrested 80 juveniles yesterday, so within the last 10 days we've seen a decrease in the number of juveniles arrested,' Oaks said. Later, Roel Rodriguez, the agent who will head the new processing facility, said that daily arrest tally was down from 200 to 300 unaccompanied children at the surge's height. Children arrested after entering the U.S. without their parents posed a challenge for the Border Patrol. Its stations are equipped only with simple holding cells and not intended for extended stays. When agents began arresting more children than could be quickly processed they backed up stations in the Rio Grande Valley, forcing the agency to bus and fly detainees to other parts of Texas and out of state. Protection: A woman, holding her daughter, wears a cloth over her head to protect her identity from waiting news media, as she deplanes . Oaks' comments jibe with a general drop in total immigrant arrests in South Texas in the final week of June. The Border Patrol has not released such data for July, but weekly arrest totals included in law enforcement intelligence reports obtained by The Associated Press in May and June show that arrests dropped in the final week of June to a level not seen since mid-May. Weekly arrest totals in the Rio Grande Valley during those months peaked in mid-June at more than 9,000. The factors contributing to the drop are unclear and it is unknown if it will continue. Oaks said that with the opening of the McAllen facility, the Border Patrol was winding down a similar processing center in Nogales, Arizona, and he expected it to close within a week. The vast majority of the children enter the U.S. in South Texas and the new processing facility is just around the corner from the region's busiest Border Patrol station. Law requires the Border Patrol to turn the children over to HHS within 72 hours of their arrest. He said his sector now had fewer than 200 unaccompanied children in custody, compared to as many as 1,200 on any given day during the peak. Deported: A woman and her son walk on the tarmac after disembarking from a plane with deportees from the U.S., at the Ramon Villeda international airport in San Pedro Sula . Families: Two women and their children, who were deported from the United States, walk on the tarmac after deplaning . The children, mostly from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, are fleeing widespread gang violence and poverty in their home countries. Some come to reunite with parents already in the U.S., while others flee for their lives. Some parents have said they've heard rumors that the children will be allowed to remain in the U.S. and the government tries to reunite children with relatives in the U.S. while they wait for their cases to be heard. Generally, the children have been turning themselves in to the first official in a uniform they see after crossing the Rio Grande. President Barack Obama has requested $3.7 billion in emergency spending to deal with what he termed 'an urgent humanitarian situation.' That request increasingly appears in jeopardy as Democrats and Republicans clash over how to remedy the situation. The new McAllen facility was set up inside a leased warehouse. Tall chain-link fences divide it into four 'pods,' each capable of holding up to 250 children. Children will sleep on small green mattresses, receive medical screenings and have common areas to watch television. 'The issue is very complex. We're not talking about criminals or anything,' Oaks said. 'These are innocent children fleeing desperate times whether it's poverty, whether it's violence, whether it's the draw of a better life the United States, whether it's family reunification.'","33 children and 26 women were welcomed at San Pedro Sula airport's Center for Returned Migrants in Honduras .

"By . Sophie Borland Health Reporter, In San Diego . Gardening, doing the housework or going for brisk walks can treble IVF success, according to researchers. Women who led active lifestyles in the year leading up to their treatment were far more likely to conceive. Scientists have been divided about whether exercise helps or hinders the chances of pregnancy, either naturally or with IVF. Active: Gardening, doing the housework or going for brisk walks can treble IVF success, researchers say . Research: Women who go for brisk walks are three times more likely to conceive than those who spend most of the day sitting down . While some studies have found that . physical activity reduces fertility, others have found it improves it – . or makes no difference. Now . scientists have found that women who do the housework, go for brisk . walks or take other ‘moderate’ forms of exercise are three times more . likely to conceive than those who spend most of the day sitting down. The lifestyles of 87 women undergoing IVF were compared in the year leading up to their treatment. The researchers gave the women a score depending on how much physical activity they did each day. This did not necessarily have to be exercise but could include dusting, vacuuming, pushing the buggy or gardening. The findings will be presented this . week to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine’s annual . conference in San Diego, California. Scientists who are close to developing a male version of the contraceptive pill may find their efforts have been largely in vain. Research shows that 74 per cent of women would stay on the pill anyway just in case men forgot to take theirs – or it didn’t work. And 34.5 per cent of women said they didn’t think their husbands or boyfriends would remember to take the pill, according to a study being presented to the conference. Lead researcher Dr Kathryn Calhoun, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said exercise prevents the body from producing too much insulin, which is thought to be harmful to the development of eggs. ‘Exercise is really beneficial for . maintaining insulin sensitivity, so it seems to protect against this . problem,’ she added. ‘This study supports the message of maintaining an . active lifestyle way before getting pregnant.’ The NHS advises all adults to do at least two and a half hours moderate exercise a week such as jogging, cycling or even gardening. Pregnant women are told to do no more than four 30-minute sessions a week but there are no specific guidelines for those trying to conceive. Some women think they should get as much rest as possible in the months beforehand and cut back on exercise or strenuous chores. Dr Allan Pacey, fertility expert at Sheffield University and chairman of the British Fertility Society, said: ‘I would have thought a little moderate exercise would be helpful as it changes your mood, changes your physiology and it may make people more interested in sex.’","Gardening or going for brisk walks can treble chance of success .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The father of Nicole Brown Simpson has passed away aged 91 after battling Alzheimer's for several years, one of his daughters has revealed. Lou Brown, whose ex son-in-law O.J. Simpson was found not guilty of killing his daughter in 1994, still thought she was alive in his later years and would call her name, a source told RadarOnline. 'Every so often he’d suddenly call out, ""Nicole, are you there? Where's Nicole?""' the source claimed. 'It was heartbreaking... He went to his grave thinking she was still alive.' Mr Brown, a World War II veteran, passed away at 3.40am on Thursday surrounded by his wife, Judith, and his daughters, one of the women, Denise Brown, told Radar. Loss: Nicole Brown Simpson's father, Lou Brown (pictured left with his wife, daughters and lawyer in the 1990s), has passed away aged 91 after battling Alzheimer's for years, his daughter Denise revealed . 'Unfortunately to most people, he will be . forever known as O.J. Simpson's ex father-in-law, but he was so much . more,' Denise said. 'Obviously I am heartbroken that he is gone, but . happy at the same time. He is in a better place and he is no longer . suffering.' The family were pictured at the murder and civil trial for Brown's ex-husband, actor and former NFL star O.J. Simpson, who was accused of stabbing her to death at their home in 1994. Simpson and Nicole Brown had married in 1985 and had two children, Sydney and Justin. In 1989, the former football player pleaded no contest to a domestic violence charge against Simpson and the couple ultimately divorced in 1992. On June 12, 1994, she and her friend Ron Goldman were found killed at her Los Angeles home and Simpson was accused of the crimes. Loss: His daughter Nicole was murdered in Los Angeles in 1994 and her ex-husband, former NFL star O.J. Simpson, was sensationally found not guilty of the crime in 1995 . Family: Mr Brown, left, and his wife Judith smile with their attorney after a civil trial returned a verdict finding O. J. Simpson liable on all counts in the wrongful deaths of Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman . On June 17, the day Simpson was supposed to turn himself over to police, the former football player led officers on an infamous low-speed pursuit in a white Ford Bronco SUV in California. Simpson finally surrendered to police and the internationally publicized trial lasted one year and was dubbed the 'trial of the century'. In 1995, the disgraced NFL star was acquitted of the 1994 murders. After the case, Mr Brown was calm about the verdict and vowed not to fight for the couple's children, if Simpson wanted them back, simply stating that in-fighting was bad for any family. His daughter Denise said he was active in domestic violence organizations following Nicole's death. Locked up: In this interview in 2004, Simpson said he hopes the real killer is found so that he can have the pleasure of proving people wrong. He is now serving time for kidnapping and armed robbery in 2007 . In 2008, Simpson was found guilty of kidnapping, armed robbery and other charges in what he said was an attempt to retrieve memorabilia and personal items from two sports collectibles dealers in a casino hotel room. Simpson was sentenced to between nine to 33 years in Nevada state prison. The Brown family said that funeral and burial arrangements are pending, but a source told Radar that Mr Brown wanted to be buried next to Nicole.","Lou Brown 'still believed Nicole was alive and still called out for her'

"By . Sarah Harris . White working-class pupils are becoming increasingly marginalised by multicultural curriculums, a report has found . White working-class pupils are becoming increasingly marginalised by multicultural curriculums, a report has warned. They are being turned off school by lessons that  celebrate diversity but do  not ‘reflect the culture and lives’ of their own community. The problem is being compounded by growing up in ‘a small world’ with low parental expectations and an early ‘language deficit’ which sees youngsters arriving at primary school talking only in ‘grunts’. It means white working-class pupils end up being outperformed by every major ethnic group at GCSEs, according to the research by Lambeth Council and Goldsmiths, University of London. Researchers interviewed 25 head teachers and deputies; 51 teachers and teaching assistants; 10 governors; 39 white working-class parents and 61 pupils at 14 schools in Lambeth, South London. Parents ‘lamented a lack of white culture reflected in school life which perpetuated the marginalisation they felt within their communities’. The report, Raising the Achievement of White Working Class Pupils, said many parents felt isolated within a ‘diverse’ community and declared themselves as the new  ‘ethnic group’. However, they were also being marginalised by middle-class parents who took up places at facilities such as Children’s Centres. Schools and parents felt curriculums did not ‘reflect the culture and lives of white working class children’. A headteacher said: ‘There has been much emphasis in recent years on elements of black history and a celebration of cultural days such as Portuguese Day. There has been nothing for the British culture. This might have led to a sense of them losing their identity.’ Another said: ‘It is very difficult for the white children to identify culturally with the other, more dominant, cultures in the school. They aspire to Eminem or street culture and I would say that a lot of their role models are black. They speak in South London patois.’ The report, by Dr Feyisa Demie, head of research at Lambeth Council, and Dr Kristin Lewis, of Goldsmiths, University of London, said the Government should support schools to ‘develop a multicultural curriculum that treats White British identity in the same way as ethnic minorities’. ‘This curriculum should give confidence for White British pupils to proudly assert their identity as an ethnic group,’ the document added. Children are being turned off school by lessons that celebrate diversity but do not reflect their own communities . Schools . struggle to get white working-class parents to engage with their . children’s learning in contrast with the ‘high aspiration of the . immigrant community’, the report said. It . also warns that many white working-class children ‘know little of a . life beyond their home and school’ and do not even visit local parks . amid a lack of family ambition. Staff at a school said: ‘The parents don’t go anywhere. They stay in their flats watching TV. They do not travel; they don’t go into other parts of London.’ This ‘lack of aspiration’ along with a ‘culture of instant gratification’ for material things proved challenging for many schools, the paper said. And problems emerge as some white working-class children arrive at primary school, unable to even recognise their own name. Traditional dissection will be  back in school science labs with the launch of new biology A-levels. From next year, teenagers will have to carry out at least 12 practical experiments per subject during the proposed two-year course. Currently, they only need to do four for each science A-level. These include dissection, with pupils learning to use instruments and produce drawings. Schools will offer a ‘mammalian heart’ or plant organ for dissection. Compulsory dissection was last offered on A-level biology exam papers in 1985, by what is now the OCR exam board. In recent years, schools reported abandoning the practice of cutting up frogs or rats out of concern for squeamish pupils and fears they could turn their scalpels on each other. Ian Harvey, head of biology at Hills Road Sixth Form College, Cambridge, believes schools will have pupils dissect hearts bought from butchers rather than rats. The report said: ‘A head teacher talked of some young children, more frequently the white working class, coming to school only being able to grunt because they had been “stuck in front of a TV all day”.’ Teachers also said white working-class pupils do not have language models or the ‘mindset’ of EAL (English as an Additional Language) learners. The ‘language deficit’ is so severe children from white working-class homes need the same remedial support as those who have English as a second language, the report said. ‘Staff felt the school grants needed to be rethought as there is currently no money to support the language deficit within the white working class community,’ it said.","White working-class pupils becoming marginalised by multicultural curriculums, report says .

"By . Jack Doyle . Ed Miliband is refusing to reveal Labour’s real plans for government in case they scare off voters, a senior Left-wing figure has claimed. Andrew Harrop, general secretary of the Fabian Society, a think tank with close links to Labour, lifted the lid on the row convulsing the party. His comments will lead to speculation Labour is hiding even more radical policies from voters ahead of the General Election. Scroll down for video . Lifting the lid: Andrew Harrop, a senior left-wing figure, has suggested Ed Miliband has refused to reveal Labour's policies in case they scare off voters . They came in response to bombshell claims by Labour’s policy chief that ideas by party policy working groups had been ‘parked’ by the leadership and replaced with ‘cynical nuggets of policy to chime with our focus groups and Press strategy’. Jon Cruddas was recorded telling a meeting of the Left-wing pressure group Compass that there was a ‘profound dead hand at the centre’ of the party preventing the release of detailed policy. The MP for Dagenham and Rainham, who is on the Left of the party, also criticised as ‘punitive’ a policy announced last week suggesting Labour could cut jobseeker’s allowance for those aged 18 to 21. Claims: Jon Cruddas, the MP for Dagenham and Rainham was recorded saying there was 'profound dead hand at the centre' of the party preventing release of policies . Yesterday Mr Harrop told the BBC News Channel: ‘Labour does have a problem of announcing very small policies that they’re trying to get a daily headline out of. ‘There is a struggle in the party between people who are being very cautious, not revealing too much in case they scare people off, against people like Jon Cruddas who says we have got to be big and bold. ‘You do need big announcements because at the moment people don’t know what difference the Labour Party would make.’ The row exposes the long-standing tension within Labour between those who advocate pushing radical ideas, and strategists who say Ed Miliband can win with the 35 per cent ‘core’ Labour vote. Last night, in an apparent effort to divert attention from the row, Labour pushed out a pro-business policy. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said the party would commit to keeping corporation tax levels at the lowest of all the G7 countries if elected. Other measures would encourage longer-term investment in Britain, he will say in a speech today. Mr Balls was forced on to the defensive yesterday as he claimed Mr Cruddas was ‘not frustrated’ but ‘excited’ about Labour’s policy agenda, and that his complaints were about how policy was presented to the public. He told the Andrew Marr Show: ‘We are all working together on these big reforms’. He insisted the party was coming up with ‘big ideas’. At the Compass meeting on June 21, according to a secret recording passed to the Sunday Times, Mr Cruddas criticised the decision not to sign up to a 250-page report by the centre-left think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research and instead to launch the policy on benefits for young people. ‘The IPPR produced this report covering the whole gamut of social policy,’ he said. ‘We managed…to condense it into one story about a punitive hit on 18 to 21-year-olds around their benefits. ‘We set up independent reviews to rethink social policy, economic policy, democracy, local government – they come up with ideas and they’re just parked. ‘And instead instrumentalised, cynical nuggets of policy … crowd out any innovation or creativity.’ He added: ‘There is all sorts of creativity alongside a profound dead hand at the centre.’ Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘These comments prove Ed Miliband is a weak leader of a divided party. He’s just not up to it. Labour are not serious about fixing the welfare system. ‘Even Ed Miliband’s own policy chief attacks Labour as having “no interesting ideas”.’ Stephen Kinnock and wife Helle Thorning-Schmidt . A small group of families are retaining their grip on the Labour Party by letting their children ‘inherit’ seats in Parliament, Jon Cruddas warned last night. His is the latest warning over the role of the so-called ‘Red Princes’ – the offspring of senior figures. Neil and Glenys Kinnock’s son, Stephen – husband of Danish premier Helle Thorning-Schmidt – and Jack Straw’s son, Will, are both fighting seats at the next election, while Euan Blair and David Prescott are eyeing up moves in to Westminster. Mr Cruddas said Labour should devolve power to local people rather than let ‘certain families reproduce their control over the party’.","Think tank leader's comments lead to speculation party is hiding radical policies .

"By . Chris Cutmore . Follow @@Chris_Cutmore . Click here for the latest leaderboard from The Open Championship . It was supposed to be Rory McIlroy who suffered from freaky Fridays but instead it was Tiger Woods whose bid to become Open champion was nearly over before the weekend after a shocking five-over-par second round of 77 at Hoylake. After an impressive opening 69 it was not out of the question that Woods could still somehow conjure a magnificent victory in just his second tournament following major back surgery in March. In the end only a birdie at the final hole helped the 14-time major winner survive into the weekend with a score of two-over-par after two rounds - right on the cut-mark. Alas, it was not his back that was bothering him but his achilles heel. VIDEO Scroll down to go behind the scenes at Royal Liverpool Golf Club with German golfer Martin Kaymer . Struggling for form: Tiger Woods shot a five-over-par round of 77 to leave him just inside the cut-mark at The Open Championship in Hoylake . Getting out of the long stuff: Woods watches his shot from the rough on the tenth hole at Royal Liverpool Golf Course in Hoylake during his second round . Through clenched teeth: Woods sends grass up into the air as he hacks a shot away from the rough during the second round of The Open . Eye of the Tiger: Woods smashes the ball on the 18th fairway as attempts to claw back a respectable score during his second round . Beautiful: Woods looks on at the 11th hole at Hoylake as thousands of spectators enjoy the second round of The Open Championship at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club . Attracting the crowds: Despite Woods' woes on Friday, the public still flocked to follow the 14-time major winner as he made his way around Hoylake . Frustration: Woods wipes his brow with his towel during the second round of The Open Championship at Hoylake as he moved back to two-over-par overall . Woods won at Hoylake eight years ago by employing his ‘stinger’ iron of nearly every tee but in strong winds here he was forced to reach for his driver on both of the opening holes. Woods struggled to control the flight of his ball and opened with a double bogey, followed by a bogey at the second. From then on Woods played remarkably steady golf, carding 14 pars in succession but failing to take advantage of three par fives – holes where birdies are crucial for anyone hoping to lift the game’s ultimate prize come Sunday evening. Then, on the 17th tee, disaster struck. Woods again reached for the driver but carved it wildly out of bounds into the hospitality tents on the right. He walked down the fairway in the vain hope that his ball was playable but was soon forced back to the tee. Again Woods took driver, this time he hooked it way left and into deep rough. A triple bogey seven was the inevitable result and suddenly the former world No 1 was scrambling to make the cut. Looking for the extra something: Woods waits on the tenth tee during the second round of The Open, pondering what his next shot will be . Anguish: Woods hacked his way around Hoylake on Friday and could only manage a five-over-par round of 77 at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club . Splashing around in the sand: Woods found himself in the bunker on the first hole at Royal Liverpool Golf Club and it didn't really improve much from there . Tiger in the long grass: Woods found himself finding hazard after hazard around Hoylake as he struggled to find his rhythm and control his swing . Up in the air: Woods lifts his foot and holds his club in a frustrated manner after his approach shot on the seventh hole during the second round of The Open . Woods needed a birdie at the last to ensure his place in the field at the weekend. A good drive was imperative. But, with out-of-bounds again lurking down the right, Woods opted to hit a three-wood. He nailed that down the middle of the fairway but left 261 yards for his second shot, which missed to the right of the green. A deft chip left a nervy six-footer for birdie and a chance to play at the weekend. Hoylake held its breath. Woods had never suffered back-to-back missed cuts in his entire career, which has been built upon his ability to deliver in the tensest moments - just like this. Typical Tiger, he nailed the putt. But with Woods just scraping through to the weekend he will now face further questions over whether his driver swing will ever again be able to deliver the four majors he still needs to overtake Jack Nicklaus’s record of 18. 'I got off to a terrible start . again,' Woods said. 'And I had some opportunities to make a few birdies along the way . to get back to even par for the day, and I just never did. I just never . made anything. I had myself in good positions to make birdies, and I . just didn't do it.' Woods is still hopeful of a victory, and referred to Paul Lawrie's heroics at the 1999 Open, when the Scot completed the biggest comeback in major championship history by recovering from 10 strokes behind in the final round, and winning the subsequent three-man play off against Justin Leonard and Jean van de Velde. 'I'm pretty far back. Luckily I've got two rounds to go. And hopefully I can do something like Paul did in '99. He made up, I think, ten in one day. Hopefully I can play well on the weekend and at least give myself a shot at going to the back nine on Sunday.' McIlroy, meanwhile, shot a second successive 66 to move to 12-under-par and heads into the weekend 14 shots ahead of Woods.

"By . Ray Massey . If you feel like you need a personal assistant to run your life, Jaguar Land Rover claims to have the answer. Its ‘self-learning’ car monitors your lifestyle and even predicts your next move, from the daily school run to that long-overdue trip to the gym. The mobile PA and life coach can also become so used to your schedule that it can interrogate your electronic diary to see what’s coming up - and prepare you for it. Jaguar Land Rover's intelligent technology will be used in future models. It works by recognising the driver from their smartphone or similar device (pictured). This means that by the time the driver opens the door, the car has already set the mirrors, steering wheel and seat, and interior temperature .

Jaguar Land Rover’s intelligent technology will be used in future models and works by recognising the driver from their smartphone or other device. It then uses the information it gleans to tee them up for the day. This means that by the time the driver has opened the door, the car has already set the mirrors, steering wheel and seat, and interior temperature to the individual’s own preferences. It’s also smart enough to change the temperature if it is snowing or raining. Jaguar land Rover showcased its Smart Assistant technology earlier today at its engineering centre in Gaydon, Warwickshire. A Jaguar land Rover spokesman said: ‘The self-learning car will also know if you are going to the gym, and will have learnt that you prefer a certain temperature on the way there to warm-up, and a different temperature to cool down on your way home. 'If you always use the massage function at a particular time or location on a journey, the car will be able to predict this as well.’ He added: ‘If you are taking the children to school, the car will recognise every passenger and offer each their own preferred music, video or radio options. ‘If you usually make a phone call at a certain time or on a particular journey, the car will predict this and will offer to make the call. If you are going to be late for your next appointment, the car will offer to email or call ahead with minimal or no interaction from the driver. ‘ . Computer software in the system not only recognises the driver and learns their habits, it can then predict their routine and changing preferences. It will even check a calendar in advance and remind owners to take their child's sports kit to sports day, or make an important phone call (pictured) It also learns an individual’s driving style in a range of traffic conditions and on different types of road so the car can apply these ‘learned’ and preferred distance settings and acceleration habits. Jaguar Land Rover’s director of research and technology Dr Wolfgang Epple added: ‘Up until now most self-learning car research has only focussed on traffic or navigation prediction. 'We want to take this a significant step further and our new learning programme means information learnt about you will deliver a completely personalised driving experience and enhance driving pleasure.’ Dr Epple continued: ‘This is important because in the future customers will still want an emotional connection and a thrilling drive - with the ability to drive autonomously when required.’ Jaguar also unveiled its virtual  windscreen that uses the entire screen as a display so the driver's eyes need never leave the road. Drivers on a racetrack could have 'ghost cars' projected onto the screen which they could then race (pictured), said Jaguar . He said the lessons learned by one car could be stored and transferred to future Jaguars or Land Rovers. At the event, Jaguar also unveiled its ‘virtual windscreen’ that offers drivers a 3D image instrument cluster, and could replace the rear view mirror. It uses the entire windscreen as a display so the driver’s eyes need never leave the road, and high quality hazard, speed and navigation symbols are projected together onto the screen. Jaguar Land Rover is also developing a gesture control system to keep the driver’s eyes on the road, and reduce distraction by limiting the need to look at or feel for buttons and switches to press. This is based on touchscreens that detect the proximity of a user’s finger from around 6 inches (15cm), which means the system can be used to accurately track a user’s hand and any gestures it makes inside the car.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Behind all the reports about Google’s Android Wear, and the countless Apple iWatch rumours, Microsoft’s own smartwatch has slipped under the radar a little. But two patents published this week suggest the firm is definitely still on track to launch its own range of wearable tech - and it could be released as soon as October. A source close to the plans confirmed the release date, said it would be cross-platform, and added the watch could also have its display on the inside of the wrist. Two patents published this week (file pictured) suggest Microsoft is still on track to release its own range of wearable tech - and it could be released as soon as October. A source close to the plans confirmed this release date, and added the watch could have its display on the inside of the wrist . Nothing has been officially confirmed by Microsoft yet, but previous rumours claim: . The watch will have a removable band that will come in a red, black, yellow and blue. It will be made of oxynitride aluminium - a translucent form of the metal. Microsoft's smartwatch is also said to run a version of Windows 8. Prototypes of the device are being tested by the Surface team and the watch could have the connector featured on the tablet. A source close to the plans has said the . device will launch in October, and it could have its display on the . inside of the wrist. It is also expected to work across multiple platforms, including Android, iOS and Windows PC. This would make the watch more 'natural' to use, and the screen would be visible by turning the wrist upwards. The source also said the gadget wouldn't be as bulky as Samsung's range of smartwatches, or the Moto 360. Instead, it is expected to be sleeker, thinner, and more closely resemble a fitness band, such as the Nike Fuelband. Both the patents published earlier this week were originally filed back in 2012. The first is titled Discreetly Displaying Contextually Relevant Information on a display device, and shows a smartwatch displaying notifications and GPS navigation. It was filed on 24 December 2012. The second, called Dynamic User Interfaces Adapted to Inferred User Contexts, shows how Microsoft plans to add sensors to track the level of activity the wearer is doing - from sitting down to running. The source also said the gadget wouldn't be as bulky as Samsung's watch range, or the Moto 360. Instead, it is expected to be sleeker and thinner, and more closely resemble a fitness band, such as the Nike Fuelband (pictured).

Both patents show wrist worn devices that connect with a phone, and are fitted with built-in heart rate monitors, accelerometers and GPS units (pictured) This second patent also explained that the interface would react to varying activity levels in different ways. It was filed on 26 December 2012. Both patents show wrist worn devices that . connect with a phone or other smart device, and are fitted with built-in . heart rate monitors, accelerometers and GPS units. Although this technology is not new, Microsoft's patents pre-date current devices on the market and there may be patent infringements filed as a result. The rumours about an October launch originated from website Tom’s Hardware, which stated that a ‘trusted source with knowledge of the development’ confirmed the release, and that the phone will work across multiple platforms. At the moment, Samsung’s range of smartwatches only work with its own handsets, and its expected that any watch Apple releases will be similarly proprietary. Last month, a similar patent was published that revealed Microsoft was working on sports watch, with built-in heart rate monitor. According to the latest rumours, there will be 11 sensors inside the firm’s watch including accelerometer, GPS and microphone. Apple is expected to launch its own smartwatch in September. Microsoft's watch is rumoured to work across platforms, including Android, iOS and Windows. At the moment, Samsung's Gear and Gear Fit work with its own handsets. The Gear Live (pictured) will work with any Android device running the latest software, and its expected any watch Apple releases will be similarly proprietary .

"By . Mark Prigg . Scientists say they have found the first solid archaeological evidence that some of the first permanent British settlers in America survived harsh conditions by resorting to cannibalism. The Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History and archaeologists from Jamestown have revealed the bones of a 14-year-old girl they have named Jane with clear signs that she was cannibalized. The human remains date back to the deadly winter of 1609-1610, known as the 'starving time' in Jamestown, when hundreds of colonists died. Scroll down for video . Doug Owsley,from the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, displays the skull of  'Jane' Jane left the English south coast in June 1609 as part of the largest fleet yet to sail for Jamestown . Jamestown was a settlement in the Colony of Virginia, and the first permanent English settlement in the Americas. It was established by the Virginia . Company of London as 'James Fort' on May 14, 1607 after several failed . earlier attempts, and  served as the capital of the colony for 83 years, . from 1616 until 1699. Scientists have said the settlers likely arrived during the . worst drought in 800 years, bringing a severe famine for the 6,000 . people who lived at Jamestown between 1607 and 1625. For years there have been tales of the starving English settlers . resorting to eating dogs, mice, snakes and shoe leather at Jamestown, . the first permanent English settlement in America. There were also written accounts of settlers eating their own dead, but archaeologists had been skeptical of those stories. Smithsonian forensic anthropologist . Douglas Owsley said the human remains date back to a deadly winter known . as the 'starving time' in Jamestown from 1609 to 1610. Hundreds of colonists died during the . period. Scientists have said the settlers likely arrived during the . worst drought in 800 years, bringing a severe famine for the 6,000 . people who lived at Jamestown between 1607 and 1625. The historical record is chilling. Early Jamestown colony leader George Percy wrote of a 'world of . miseries,' that included digging up corpses from their graves to eat . when there was nothing else. 'Nothing was spared to maintain life,' he . wrote. In one case, a man killed, 'salted,' and began eating his pregnant wife. Both Percy and Capt. John Smith, the . colony's most famous leader, documented the account in their writings. The man was later executed.

'One amongst the rest did kill his wife, powdered her, and had eaten . part of her before it was known, for which he was executed, as he well . deserved,' Smith wrote. 'Now whether she was better roasted, boiled or . carbonado'd (barbecued), I know not, but of such a dish as powdered wife . I never heard of.' Archaeologists at Jamestown and Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia were . somewhat skeptical of the stories of cannibalism in the past because . there was no solid proof, until now. 'Historians have questioned, well did it happen or not happen?' Owsley . said. 'And this is very convincing evidence that it did.' Owsley has been working with William Kelso, the chief archaeologist at Jamestown, since their first burial discovery in 1996. The remains of the 14-year-old girl discovered in the summer of 2012 . marks the fourth burial of human remains uncovered at Jamestown. Her . remains were found in a cellar at the site that had been filled with . trash, including bones of animals that had been consumed, according to . archaeologists.

The girl was likely . already dead at the time. A facial reconstruction of 'Jane of Jamestown' 'We call her Jane: female, fourteen years old, possibly from southern England,' the researchers say. They believe she left Plymouth, England, in June 1609 as part of the largest fleet yet to sail for Jamestown.

The skull of  'Jane of Jamestown' is seen with models used to reconstruct her face during a news conference at the National Museum of Natural History, Wednesday . The reconstruction of the female Jamestown colonist was based on a CT scan that allowed a digital reconstructing of her splintered cranium. That digital image then became a 3D model of the skull that Ivan Schwartz and his team at StudioEIS in New York used to create a likeness of her facial features through sculpting and painting. Numerous small knife cuts and punctures in the mandible of  'Jane of Jamestown' can be clearly seen . There was a cultural stigma against killing . someone for food, Owsley said. But it was clear to him immediately that there were signs of cannibalism. 'It is the evidence found on those bones that put it within the context . of this time period,"" he said. 'This does represent a clear case of . dismemberment of the body and removing of tissues for consumption.' It was the work of someone not skilled at butchering, Owsley said. There was a sense of desperation. The bones show a bizarre attempt to open the skull. Four shallow chop marks can be seen on the top of the girl's skull, found in a basement .

At the current rate, the figures should soon pass the record of 62,000 people who arrived by sea in 2011, when numbers swelled amid the 'Arab Spring' uprisings across North Africa and the Middle East. An Italian ship, part of the navy's migrant rescue mission Mare Nostrum or ""Our Sea"", was due to arrive at the Sicilian port of Pozzallo later on Monday towing the fishing boat and carrying 566 survivors.

"By . Joe Callaghan . With just over two weeks to go to kick-off, World Cup chiefs may have a new concern on their hands with the playing surface at the Maracana in a shocking state. It may be the spiritual home of 'O Jogo Bonito', but with 16 days until the tournament begins and 19 days until it hosts Argentina and Bosnia in its first match, it doesn't look like anyone will be playing beautiful football on the hallowed ground any time soon. FIFA staged a final run-through of the Rio de Janeiro venue on Monday and while the stadium itself is good to go, the surface is anything but. The Maracana pitch looked unfit for even a casual kickabout, such was its terribly scarred, pock-marked appearance. It may be suited more to beach football if the piles of sand being applied to it were anything to go by as teams of groundsmen tackled the brown surface. Poor: Ground staff try to get Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium playing surface into a better condition . Brown: Ground staff survey the playing surface, which is brown and has had sand added to it . First up: The Maracana hosts Lionel Messi and Co in just 19 days when Argentina meet Bosnia . Just last week, iconic goalkeeper Rogerio Ceni blasted the Maracana, blaming the pitch for his Sao Paulo side's 5-2 loss to Fluminense in the Brazilian top flight. It echoed plenty of previous warnings over the issue. The surface came in for criticism during last year's Confederations Cup final, cutting up badly underfoot as Brazil trounced Spain. Then last October it was relaid after Botafogo goalkeeper Jefferson, part of Brazil's 2014 squad, said that it was unfit for international football. By that time it had played host to a beyond intensive 33 matches in five months. However stadium and local organising chiefs appear to have not only failed to learn their lesson but inexplicably heaped even more action onto the replacement pitch. By Sportsmail's tally, the Maracana has hosted an astonishing 37 competitive games between January 19 and May 18 - a period of just 17 weeks. By comparison the Emirates Stadium staged 29 games in all competitions over the course of nine months last season, Old Trafford 26. Overused? The Maracana stadium has hosted 37 competitive matches in just 17 weeks, putting strain on the pitch . The Rio arena will also be the most overworked playing field in the tournament with seven matches taking place there. After the Argentina-Bosnia clash, it plays host to the meeting of Spain and Chile on June 18,  Belgium's clash with Russia on June 22, France's final group match against Ecuador three days later, a last-16 tie and a quarter final before the tournament decider on July 13. Organisers, who told Brazilian media this morning that FIFA were working 'to guarantee that the grass will be rooted and fixed' in time for the tournament, will be hoping for a miraculous repair job. After delayed stadiums and unfinished infrastructure projects, a playing surface unfit for purpose at a World Cup final venue would be unforgivable.

"By . Allan Hall . and Steve Nolan . Airplane manufacturers are making seats for overweight passengers who are too big to comfortably fit in normal sized seats. Airbus is offering airlines the option of installing extra-wide seats on A320 jets to cope with what it describes as 'trends in demographics'. The extra-wide seats will measure 20 inches across instead of the standard 18 inches, and will likely be installed only as aisle seats. Are you sitting comfortably? Airbus is offering airlines larger seats for obese people on its A320 planes . Window and middle seats will each lose an inch of width to generate the extra space. Airbus is selling the idea as an innovative way to 'meet passenger needs' - even though two-thirds of passengers will have to make do with less space. The plans were announced this week at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, Germany. The company first suggested the idea last year, but a poll back in July by the Skyscanner website found 80 per cent of British fliers were opposed to losing seat space to accommodate larger passengers. Airbus aircraft interiors marketing manager Stefanie Von Linstow told Flightglobal: 'Passengers in the window seat are already happy and those in the centre seat might not be willing to pay as much for less width. 'The aisle seat seems the most attractive for the concept.' Room to breathe: The manufacturer is offering the larger seats on its A320 model . Samoa Air recently became the world's first airline to institute a 'pay-by-weight' system, where the weight of a passenger and their luggage determines fare price. Chief Executive Chris Langton said this was the 'fairest' way to charge travellers while addressing the obesity crisis - an acute problem in Samoa's Pacific region. Another carrier, Southwest Airlines requires its 'Customers of Size' who do not fit between the armrests to purchase another seat. In a November 2012 report on the issue, Dr Bharat Bhatta from Norway's Sogn og Fjordane University College said that a 'fat tax' is the way to price tickets 'correctly'. He said: 'The model can be technically and economically feasible to implement and its proper implementation may provide significant benefits to airlines, passengers and society at large, not just economic transfers.'","Manufacturer Airbus is offering two inch larger aisle seats on its A320 jets .

"By . Richard Spillett . Joshua Bryant was given a suspended sentence after attacking a retired couple but went on the rampage weeks later . A retired couple have hit out at the justice system after a thug who brutally attacked them walked free from court - only to attack his own family and two police officers weeks later. Joshua Bryant, 21, launched an unprovoked assault on Danny and Pamela Capaldi in the garden of their home in Horfield, Bristol last summer. But after a judge freed him on a suspended sentence, he went on another rampage earlier this year, attacking four people, including his own mother and sister. Bryant, . who was armed with a knife, punched Mr Capaldi, 62, to the ground before . grabbing his wife around the throat and kicking her in the back. Mr . Capaldi suffered a swollen brain and spent two days in hospital and his . wife has been left in constant pain with a non-healing fracture at the . base of her spine. Bryant . admitted assault causing actual bodily harm and possessing an offensive . weapon but was spared jail by a judge after a court heard had a mental . illness. But exactly a month later he was arrested again following another rampage and has now finally been sent to prison. Describing . the latest case, prosecutors said Bryant assaulted his mother and . sister after an argument over whether he could use their car. He fled the scene and stole bottles of beer from a shop before police tracked him down and he resisted arrest, prosecutors say. He . admitted two counts of assault, one of theft and two of assaulting a . constable in the execution of his duty and was given a two year sentence . earlier this week. Mr Capaldi suffered a swollen brain and spent two days in hospital after he was attacked by Bryant, who was later given a suspended sentence . Mr and Mrs . Capaldi, who have six grandchildren, have now said Bryant should have . been jailed for the first brutal attack on them. Mrs . Capaldi, 65, a retired dressmaker, said: 'Bryant left us in such pain. We are still not well, and before this week, we were also living in fear . of him still being on the streets. 'He should never have been given a second chance after what he did to us. I was even scared to have my young grandchildren to play on my street, for fear of what he might do. 'While he was walking free, I was . constantly checking behind me as I walked down the road. The judge gave . him a second chance, but he clearly didn't deserve one.' Mr Capaldi has hit out at the justice system after Bryant committed a second string of offences just weeks after he walked free from court . The couple were at home in Horfield, Bristol last July when their living room window was smashed. They went out to investigate and saw Bryant - the son of a neighbour - who launched a savage attack when they remonstrated with him. Judge Alan Large, sitting at Bristol Crown Court in March this year, freed Bryant with a suspended 19-month sentence after hearing he had a mental illness and was not taking medication. The judge told him: 'Anyone will wonder what on earth I’m doing not locking you up now. But you had a head injury when you were younger and you have been diagnosed with mental illness. 'Unless this is sorted out, it will be longer and longer in prison. This is quite an exceptional course.' Bryant was freed by a judge at Bristol Crown Court but went on to offend again .","Joshua Bryant given suspended sentence for attacking couple in their 60s .

'After she told me I was bleeding, I started crying.' Medina's family were spending a weekend on Galveston Island, where they own a beach house, but the girl was the only member of her family who decided to take a dip in the ocean darkened with seaweed. The 14-year-old said she was attacked by a shark while kneeling down in waist-deep water on West Beach. The marine predator left clearly visibly puncture wounds on the right side of the girl's upper back before swimming away. ‘We know about sharks but you never think that something like this could happen to your own daughter so I was kind of in denial at the beginning,’ said Mikaela's mother, Maria Amezaga.

Mikaela Medina said she could never have imagined a shark would attack her, but added that it could have been much worse.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Vance McAllist, the married congressman who refused to leave office after he was seen kissing a female aide on security footage, today backtracked and announced that he would run for re-election. After the video of the embrace was posted on the website of a Louisiana newspaper in April, McAllister, a father of five, said that he wouldn't seek another term. But two months later, the 40-year-old freshman congressman has said he will be on the November 4 ballot as a candidate for Louisiana's 5th District. 'Without a doubt this decision comes after much thought and prayer,' McAllister said in a statement. Scroll down for video . Announcement: Rep. Vance McAllister stands with his wife and children and announces his decision to run for re-election during a press conference in Monroe, Louisiana on Monday . 'This district has been home to me and my family all of my life. I know the needs of this congressional district very well. I also know that this district needs a strong, conservative voice in Congress.' In an interview, McAllister said that he's received an outpouring of encouragement from people in the district urging him to run and the strongest support came from his wife, Kelly. 'She sees the work that goes into it every day, and she's telling me that I really should,' he said. 'She was a strong advocate and supporter of wanting me to really consider.' The congressman, who ran on a platform of faith and family, apologized for a 'personal failure' after the security tape showed him kissing the married aide, later identified as Melissa Anne Hixon Peacock, in his congressional office. Peacock, who was the wife of his . childhood friend, Heath Peacock, later resigned and Mr Peacock revealed . that they were breaking up. They have a six-year-old son together. McAllister, . who's held the congressional seat for less than year, said he won't . spend time discussing the scandal during his campaign. Caught: A video that was released by a local paper showed McAllister and his . scheduler smooching in his Louisiana Congressional office and led to GOP leaders to call for his resignation . Kissing partner: Melissa Anne Hixon Peacock, 33, was named as the woman caught in the clinch . 'I've got a record. I'm going to talk about the future, not the past,' he said. GOP leaders, including Governor Bobby Jindal, pushed for McAllister to step down, but he refused. They called his behavior embarrassing and hypocritical and were displeased with Monday's announcement. 'Congressman McAllister made the right decision earlier when he said he would not run again. It is disappointing he changed his mind,' Jindal said in a statement. State Republican Party Chairman Roger Villere said McAllister should have stayed out of the race and worked on repairing the damage to his family. 'I just don't see how you come back in . this short period of time and say, ""OK, I've fixed everything and I'm . ready to go"",' Villere said. McAllister . tossed aside the criticism, saying: 'Those who have been against me and . have called for my resignation are those who don't even vote my . district. They're not the people I represent.' Standing by her man: Kelly McAllister sits with McAllister in their home in Swartz, Louisiana on Monday . Family: Kelly, mother to his 5 children, said: 'I'm behind him 100 percent. We made this decision as a family' The congressman, from the rural town of Swartz, held a news conference at an American Legion Hall in his district to announce his re-election bid. Torn apart: Peacock's husband Heath, pictured, was a childhood friend of McAllister's . McAllister's previous announcement that he wouldn't run again, combined with the fallout from the scandal, has attracted several new contenders for the race, leaving the incumbent congressman with a tough road to re-election. A businessman with no political experience, McAllister won a special election in November 2013 to represent the district centered in the state's northeast and central parishes, surprising the GOP by handily defeating the Republican establishment candidate. McAllister largely self-financed his election bid and got a boost from endorsements by the men of the cable television hit 'Duck Dynasty'. But the TV family appears to have moved on. Zach Dasher, a nephew of the show's Phil Robertson, is running against McAllister. Dasher said the show's stars support his campaign. 'They've got to stick with family and get out there and campaign for who they believe in,' McAllister said. 'But our relationship is still the way it was before. It's still strong.' In addition to Dasher, at least four other candidates have announced so far, and while McAllister may want to move past the video, one opponent suggested he can't. Republican businessman Harris Brown, of Monroe, said McAllister 'brought great embarrassment upon our state and district'. 'He is doing a tremendous disservice to the people of the district by running again,' Brown said in a statement. 'McAllister needs to move out of politics, so the people of the 5th Congressional District can move beyond him and his scandal.'","Louisiana congressman said on Monday that he'll be on the November 4 ballot - despite previously saying he wouldn't seek another term .

"By . Martin Robinson . Former N-Dubz singer Dappy slapped a man outside a nightclub because he feared  being stabbed after the clubber called him a 'mug' and said 'I'm going to knock you out', a court heard today. The 26-year-old, who is on trial under his real name Dino Costas Contostavlos, is accused of attacking George Chittock in a smoking area in the early hours of February 27 at Chicago's in Chelmsford. Dappy denies assault by beating at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court, where he was supported by his friend, comedian Jim Davidson, who met on Celebrity Big Brother. Scroll down for video . On trial: Pop star Dappy arrives at court for the start of his assault trial today, where he was supported by his friend, comedian Jim Davidson, who met on Celebrity Big Brother . Contostavlos told the court he had a scar on his hand after grabbing a blade when someone tried to stab him in Nottingham four or five years ago, and was 'scared' it was about to happen again. 'It takes one second for someone to put something in my ribcage. Asked if he feared he was going to be stabbed on the night of the incident, he added: 'Yeah of course, I'm always concerned about that. 'I was scared someone was going to put a hole in me.  I have had to deal all my life with people trying to cut me and taking cheap shots. 'I don't want to get stabbed. I don't want to get hurt again.' Prosecutor Jaqueline Carey told the court the slap happened after Contostavlos carried out a 'meet and greet' at Chicago Rock Cafe in in the Essex city. Victim: George Chittock says he did not provoke Dappy or crack a joke about the star's father being dead . The pair were in a smoking area along with Contostavlos's minder and two of the club's own doorstaff at about 2am when he was seen to slap Mr Chittock, she said . The performer was arrested by police and claimed he acted in self-defence. Ms Carey said: 'When the defendant lashed out, he was not under any threat or any perceived threat of violence. 'The CCTV suggests he had no genuine and honest belief that he needed to use force to defend himself.' She said Contostavlos claimed Mr Chittock had been abusive towards him earlier in the night and repeated this in the smoking area. Contostavlos arrived at court in a black Audi with blacked-out windows. Escorted by a minder, he wore a black jacket, white shirt and black tie. CCTV footage of the alleged attack was played to the court. The black-and-white footage, which lasts about 10 seconds, showed Contostavlos 'surrounded by security' when he turned and 'slapped' Mr Chittock, Ms Carey said. The defendant was acting out of 'annoyance' after claiming he was verbally abused during the night, the prosecutor added. 'He was effectively acting in a violent and unjustifiable manner,' she said. Giving evidence, Mr Chittock said he arrived at Chicago's at about 10.30pm with five friends and drank two pints of lager and a Jagerbomb during the night. Jon Harrison, defending, said early in the evening Mr Chittock told Contostavlos: 'Dappy, you're a mug, I'm going to knock you out.' Mr Chittock replied: 'Incorrect.' Row: Witnesses said Dappy slapped George Chittock outside this Chelmsford nightclub. The rapper denies assault and says he was protecting himself after Chittock said: 'I'm going to knock you out' Jon Harrison, representing Contostavlos, asked Mr Chittock whether he had abused his client two further times over the course of the night. He suggested that on the second occasion, Mr Chittock was ejected from a VIP area after saying to the performer: 'Do you remember me, you p*****?' Mr Chittock agreed he had been ejected from the area as the star had his photo taken with fans but said it was the result of a misunderstanding and he did not say anything abusive. Asked whether he had said to Contostavlos to perform a sex act on 'your dead dad' seconds before he was slapped, Mr Chittock said: 'I would not say that, I have close family members who have died and that is not right.' Mr Harrison asked whether he knew that Contostavlos' father was dead. Mr Chittock said: 'I don't know anything about his family. 'I'm not a fan of him, I don't care what goes on in his life. 'His life and my life are separate.' In response to suggestions he had deliberately intimidated Contostavlos, Mr Chittock added: 'I was not in his face. I was not in his personal area. He turned around to strike me.' Star: Dappy performed at the Isle of Wight Festival over the weekend ahead of his trial . Giving evidence, Contostavlos, who gave his profession as performing artist, said he was feeling 'energetic and alive' on the night of the incident. He insisted he did not have a 'drinking habit', adding: 'I was functional enough to go and do an amazing show so I certainly wasn't drunk.' Contostavlos said he would not be able to drink half a bottle of vodka as the prosecution claimed. He said that when he arrived at the club he heard somebody shouting 'mug, mug, mug'. He added that the 'same boy' caused trouble later in the night when he refused to have his picture taken with him. Contostavlos said he did not hear a remark about his dead father but was told about it later by a friend.  'My friend would not lie about my dead dad,' he said. The singer said he heard someone say 'Oi' or 'what' as he was leaving the smoking area and turned around to see Mr Chittock who stamped his foot on the ground. 'He was being threatening towards me,' he said. 'I thought he was going to hit me. He's right next to me. How can he get this close to me again? 'I lifted up my hand and tried to move him away from me. If it was an attack I would have repeatedly attacked him with closed fists'. The court heard that a friend of Mr Chittock tweeted shortly after the incident, 'George started on Dappy.' Close: Dappy and Jim Davidson hug at the end of Celebrity Big Brother, as the comedian won the contest . Contostavlos said the event at Chicago's was the first time he had worked with his personal security guard on duty and he had not worked with him since. 'He wasn't used to that level of fame,' he said. Contostavlos said he was 'a million per cent' sure that it was Mr Chittock who called him a 'mug'. 'It was a violation,' he said. 'Tesco, Asda, everywhere I go there's always one person to make a rude remark.  I've got two kids. I don't want my two kids knowing their father gets called a mug. 'This is a stitch up. This is what's happening in this case.' Contostavlos said Mr Chittock had been 'intimidating' and 'violating' him throughout the night. 'He could have stabbed me,' he said. 'I've been through it.  I've been scrutinised. I've been signed since 17 years of age. This happens all the time.  I thought he was going to lash out at me. Ms Carey suggested that Contostavlos slapped the alleged victim because he was annoyed to see him still in the club after being called a 'mug'. He replied: 'You obviously don't like me as a person. I didn't slap him. I moved him away.' His friend, comedian Jim Davidson, also attended in a show of support. Outside court, Davidson said: 'Dappy is a good friend of mine, we became close on Big Brother. 'I don't know what's happened in this case but I'm just here to show him my support.' Contostavlos finished in second place to Davidson on reality show Celebrity Big Brother a month before the alleged incident. Contostavlos, of St Albans, Hertfordshire, is on unconditional bail. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Star, 26, says he was provoked by George Chittock after night out in Essex .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . A 12-year-old boy at a Boy Scout camp in San Diego has died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head Monday morning, and police were investigating whether the shooting was intentional. Police received a call Monday morning that a boy had shot himself at the camp on Fiesta Island, Officer Matt Tortorella told The Associated Press. Officers found a gun in the boy's tent. It's not clear yet where the gun came from or how it got into the camp. Crime scene: Police say the 12-year-old shot himself in the head in a tent at Fiesta Island Youth Camp and Youth Aquatic Center . Shut down: Police have closed the camp to visitors while they investigate the tragedy . The tragedy unfolded after police were called to a suicide attempt at Fiesta Island Youth Camp and Youth Aquatic Center in Mission Bay at about 7:36 Monday morning, reports NBC San Diego. Police said that when they arrived, they found a 12-year-old boy in a tent with at least one gunshot wound. They tried to revive the child, but he died on the scene. The boy was part of a Boy Scout troop from Las Vegas that arrived at the camp on Sunday intending to stay until July 5. There were no firearm programs or activities available, and Boy Scouts of America policy does not allow personal firearms at its events, organization spokesman Deron Smith said. Distressed: Other campers have been provided with grief counselors following the death of one of their Scout group . Summer holiday: The boys were to spend the week sailing, kayaking and swimming but a shooting in a 12-year-old's tent has cut the camp short . 'This is an extremely sad day for our entire scouting family,' Boy Scouts of America said in a statement. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and all those who experienced this tragedy. Our top priority is providing support to our community and for those in the grieving process.' The organization said grief counselors were sent to the camp. The boy's father was a chaperone for the troop, and about 20 Scouts were at the camp, Lieutenant Mike Hastings said. The weeklong summertime program allows Scouts to camp among sandy dunes on Mission Bay in San Diego. They can sail, kayak, and do other activities while earning merit badges.","A 12-year-old boy died Monday morning of a gunshot wound to the head .

"By . Francesca Chambers . President Barack Obama's foreign policy approval rating slid even further this month, reaching an all-time low of 37 percent, a new poll shows.

They did ask about Obama's decision to swap five Taliban . commanders for an American soldier being held hostage by the terrorist . network, however, and the results do not bode well for Obama. Less than one in three Americans say Obama made the right call. Americans are so dissatisfied with the president's leadership on a host of issues that 54 percent of them say they've lost faith in his ability to lead the country. Not getting the job done: Americans are so dissatisfied with the president's leadership on a host of issues that 54 percent of them say they've lost faith in his ability to lead the country . President Obama's foreign policy approval rating has plunged in his second term . The president has been floundering in the foreign policy arena for the last two and a half years, according to a series of polls commissioned by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal. The last time a majority of Americans said they approved of the way the president was handling foreign policy was December of 2012. Since then his foreign policy approval rating has bounced around the mid 40s before firmly sliding into the upper 30s two months ago. Similarly, President Obama's foreign policy disapproval rating reached an all-time high this month at 57 percent. Americans' opinions of the president overall have soured throughout his second term. A poll released last week by CNN/ORC International found that Americans now have as much disdain for President Obama as they do former President Bush, who exited the White House with gutter-level approval ratings. Both presidents received negative feedback from 51 percent of respondents. Americans who took the NBC/WSJ poll gave Obama a 41 percent approval rating, his lowest-ever approval rating, for the second time in the last three months. People who were displeased withe the president named poor foreign policy decisions as the top reason for their dissatisfaction along with Obamacare. The Bergdahl terror trade came in a close second, followed by the president's handling of the economy. Poll-takers were also strongly against the president's plan to release the prisoners being held at Guantanamo Bay by a margin of 59 percent-to-26 percent. That's consistent . with a Gallup poll released last week which found that two in three Americans neither wanted Obama to set the terrorists being detained there free nor wanted him to move them to jails on U.S. soil. At issue for many Americans is the president's decision to exchange five terrorists for the release of the American soldier pictured here - Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. This shot was taken from a video that was posted by Voice of Jihad. It shows Bergdahl sitting in a vehicle guarded by the Taliban in eastern Afghanistan . Americans' negative feelings toward the president's policies both at home and abroad will not necessarily translate into a vote for Republicans in November's elections, however. 'We know more about the challenges . facing President Obama in the next two years of his term than how this . year’s congressional elections will play out in the next six months,' Democratic pollster Fred Yang, one of three pollsters responsible for the NBC/WSJ poll, said to NBC News. Democrats and Republicans were statistically tied in the poll at 45 percent and 43 percent respectively. Further more, only 29 percent of respondents said they have . a favorable view of the GOP, compared with the 38 . percent of respondents who said they saw Democrats in a positive light. The poll oversampled Democrats by several percentage points, though. Bill McInturff, the Republican who worked on the poll, summed the results up this way: 'This is a bad poll for President . Obama, and not a good poll for anybody else.'","President Barack Obama's foreign policy approval rating is at an abysmal 37 percent .
His overall approval rating is stuck in the mud at 41 percent .
A majority of Americans think he doesn't have the chops to run the country .
Obama's decision to trade five Taliban fighters for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is contributing to his unpopularity ."

The Oculus Rift, made by OculusVR, is a headset fitted with a seven-inch screen that is worn while playing certain video games. A gamer uses the console's controller in the normal way but instead of looking at a TV screen, the images are shown through the visor in stereoscopic 3D - making the gamer feel as if they are playing inside the game. Scroll down for video . The Oculus Rift headset from OculusVR is fitted with a 7inch screen that is worn while playing certain video games. A gamer uses their console's controller in the normal way but instead of looking at a TV screen, the images are shown through the visor in stereoscopic 3D - making the gamer feel as if they are playing inside the game . Developers test the Oculus Rift headset at the 2013 Oculus Developer Conference in Iceland. It works by tracking the player's head movements using sensor technology. It then uses low-latency mitigation, which is a technique used to minimise the delay between the eyes seeing the image and processing what it sees . The Oculus Rift works by tracking the player’s head movements using sensor technology. It also uses a new technique called low-latency mitigation that lets . the players explore the world as if it was a reality. Low-latency mitigation minimises the delay between the eyes seeing an image and processing what it sees. This makes the images appear to be happening closer to real time. The Rift's display shows two unique images, one for each eye, that the player’s mind . fuses into a single stereoscopic 3D view of the virtual world. At this year’s E3 conference in Los Angeles, players could immerse themselves in the first game made for the Rift – a virtual reality space dog fighting game. The prototype model had a 5.6-inch screen but this was increased to 7 inches to improve its quality after testing. The 7-inch panel's pixel . switching time is faster and reduces latency and motion blur . when the wearer turns their head quickly. The LCD has also been made brighter and it has colour depth of 24 bits per . pixel. It has field of view that is more than 90 . degrees pn the horizontal and 110 degrees on the diagonal. The resolution is 1280x800, which is around 640x800 per eye. Each eye image is shown in the panel as a pin-cushioned image that is . then corrected by lenses in the headset, generating a spherical-mapped . image for each eye. The panel's resolution is expected to be upgraded to . 1920x1080 for the final consumer version. The weight of the headset is approximately 379g. The headset has a dial on . each side that can be turned with a screwdriver which allows adjusting . each display to be moved closer or further away from the eyes. David . Gundry, EVR Programmer, said: ‘In 'traditional', non-VR games, your . field-of-view is fixed forward or controlled with the mouse or keyboard. 'The Oculus Rift allows you to look around the game as if you . were actually there. 'This makes the experience much more immersive – you . are no longer sat at home controlling a computer spaceship, you’re a . pilot sat in your fighter rocketing around space. ‘We decided to . make the game as we were all very excited about virtual reality and the . Oculus Rift, and there was a lot of internal interest about doing . something with it. 'The decision to create a dogfighting game in this . setting came from a couple of places; influences from older games such . as X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter were a big part, but there was also the inner . twelve-year-old in all of us screaming 'I want to be a space pilot!'. 'Virtual reality is such a perfect fit for this style of cockpit-based . game.’ In traditional, non-virtual reality games the gamer's field-of-view is fixed forward or controlled with the mouse or keyboard. The Oculus Rift lets players look around the game, such as X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter pictured, as if they were actually there . With the Playstation 4 and Xbox One on the horizon, EVR is keen to see the Oculus Rift used in next-generation gaming. There is, . however, no word on how much it would retail for if released. Nate . Mitchell, Vice President of Product Development at Oculus Rift, added: ‘We'd love the . Oculus Rift to work with next-gen consoles and there are no technical . hurdles preventing this from happening. 'It's simply a strategic . partnership decision for the platform holders. 'Right now, we're focused . on building an incredible, VR platform for the PC, which is a great fit . for the cutting-edge nature and requirements of high-end, immersive . virtual reality experiences.’ For gamers who can't wait to experience immersive 3D gaming, the ZEISS cinemizer OLED is an alternative to the Oculus Rift and is available now.

"By . Hilary Freeman . When I introduced my boyfriend Mickael to my father, I desperately hoped they’d get on. I feared my dad might take umbrage at his modest job as a hotel receptionist, or his thick French accent — but I could never have predicted what actually set him off: Mickael’s looks. ‘He’s very handsome,’ said Dad. ‘Are you sure he’s faithful to you?’ This was three years ago and Mickael and I were in a long-distance relationship at the time. I lived in London, he was 650 miles away in Nice, and my father simply couldn’t accept that ‘someone as good-looking as Mickael’ wouldn’t be cheating on me at every opportunity. Hot topic: Hilary and 'Le Hunk' Mickael . I was devastated that he could say something so insensitive, and offended because I was very aware he wouldn’t have said it had my boyfriend looked like John Major. A wave of insecurity flooded over me. What did Mickael, now 38 see in a diminutive, curly-haired specimen like me? At 6ft 2in tall, with broad shoulders, black hair, a Roman nose and incredible blue eyes, Mickael is the living embodiment of tall, dark and handsome. He isn’t just good-looking, he’s movie-star handsome. At college, he was picked to play Rhett Butler in a Gone With The Wind adaptation and he’s been approached by model scouts wanting to sign him up. I know I sound smug, but bear with me. Because having a handsome boyfriend isn’t all it is cracked up to be. As I’ve learned to my cost, people make assumptions about good-looking men.  Most of them, in my experience, are false and offensive. Just as blonde women are pigeon-holed as being stupid, handsome men are written off as lacking moral fibre. Most people assume they can’t be trusted around the opposite sex. They are also assumed to be shallow, vain and sex-obsessed. As a drop-dead gorgeous man’s girlfriend you have to be tough. You need a thick skin, high self-esteem and the ability not to care what other people think. Unfortunately for me, I possess none of these qualities. To paraphrase the 18th-century novelist, Samuel Richardson: ‘Handsome boyfriends often make a girlfriend’s heart ache.’ Mickael constantly tells Hilary shes pretty and says all his friends and family think so, too. He even loves her 'gappy teeth and big nose' Especially if said girlfriend is 42, 5ft 3in, with a big nose, hair that’s prone to frizz and gappy teeth. I’ve never had a problem attracting men, but I’m not conventionally beautiful and certainly not leading-lady material — unless that leading lady is Barbra Streisand. In a romcom, I’d be the kooky best friend, not the girl who gets the guy. If I were to award myself marks out of ten, I’d be a six — six-and-a-half on a good-hair day. Mickael would be a nine. In other words, he’s ‘out of my league’. But he doesn’t seem to care. More important to us is the silly sense of humour we share that can have us both in fits for hours. He constantly tells me I’m pretty and says all his friends and family think so, too. He even loves my gappy teeth and big nose. Now, that should be enough shouldn’t it? And, most of the time, it is. I know, without a doubt, that Mickael loves me. We’ve been through a lot together, including the stillbirth of our daughter 18 months ago. He’s given up his job at a hotel in Nice, his friends and his home country, and moved to London to live with me in Camden Town. So I know I shouldn’t feel insecure. Yet I often do. Men who feel they've 'lucked out' by marrying attractive women are more likely to care about their wives' needs, says a US study . We live in a shallow, looks-obsessed society, in which being beautiful is the most valuable currency. People stare at us in the street and — call me paranoid — I can tell that some of them are wondering what someone so handsome is doing with ordinary little me. Through the grapevine, I’ve heard reports of acquaintances making nasty, jealous comments about us, such as: ‘She’s punching above her weight.’ Although all of my previous partners have been attractive in my eyes, until Mickael I’d never had a partner universally considered handsome. Everyone, from friends — both straight and gay — to my 95-year-old grandma,  has commented on his good  looks. Friends have even nicknamed him ‘Le Hunk’. Several have even sent me emails — usually drunken — which begin: ‘I know this is probably really inappropriate, but can I just say that your boyfriend is really hot.’ Sometimes this makes me feel like I’m the owner of a prize bull at the county fair. People have actually congratulated me on my ‘achievement’, as though snaring a good-looking man is like winning an award, or gaining a promotion. Pleasing as it is that other people appreciate my good taste and good fortune, all this hyperbole means I’m only too aware that if our relationship were ever to go wrong, there would be a long queue of women ready to take my place. I’m not naturally jealous, but it’s hard not to look over my shoulder.And then there are Mickael’s beautiful exes who, through no fault of their own, make me feel inferior. At least two of his ex-girlfriends have modelled. He’s still good friends with one of them: a tall, sexy, willowy girl, ten years my junior, with thighs the size of my arms and men trailing in her wake wherever she goes. ‘I’m with you, not her,’ Mickael pointed out, when in a moment of weakness I confessed my sense of inadequacy. And that is true. But sometimes — usually when I’m contemplating my cellulite or finding a new grey hair — I can’t help wondering why a man who could have someone like her would want someone like me. Hilary says: 'Several have even sent me emails - usually drunken - which begin: 'I know this is probably really inappropriate, but can I just say that your boyfriend is really hot' I also worry more than I should — or ever have before — about getting fat, developing wrinkles and becoming middle-aged. Mickael reassures me by saying how much he loves my eyes and my smile, and reminding me that he can’t keep his hands off me. He talks of growing old with me and I know that, being French, he thinks older women can be just as attractive as younger ones. Supermodels aren’t even to his taste — he finds the majority superficial and lacking in character. To state the obvious, a good-looking man is no different from any other man, and a handsome face and a good character aren’t mutually exclusive. As I pointed out to my dad, just because good looks afford you more opportunities to cheat, it doesn’t mean that you’ll take them. If anything, I think the opposite is true. When you are attractive, and you can have pretty much anyone you want, there’s less motivation to do so. In my experience, it’s the insecure men, the ones who aren’t confident in themselves or their looks, who need to chat up women in order to prove their own self-worth. That’s why so many balding, paunchy men have mid-life crises and go after younger women. Mickael knows he’s handsome, but he isn’t arrogant, or vain. He cares about his appearance, but isn’t obsessed with it. He has the confidence and self-assurance of someone who has never had to try too hard. Believe it or not, he tells me he’s never actively chatted anyone up and can only remember one occasion when he was rejected by a woman. If he likes someone, and they’re single, it usually goes without saying they will like him back. The downside is that he’s been sexually harassed by strange women in bars (one thought it was fine to stroke him, without even saying hello first), and he often has to fend off the attentions of men, too. Being handsome can be dangerous. Mickael spent a week in hospital, and still has a pin in his jaw, after being punched  — from behind — by a man who took offence when he made polite smalltalk with the man’s girlfriend. In some workplaces, he has been met with cold, aggressive behaviour from other guys. One colleague told him: ‘If I had a face like yours, I’d keep my mouth shut.’ A former friend admitted he liked going out with Mickael, not so much because he enjoyed his company, but because it helped him to pull women. As a friendly, loyal and sociable person, Mickael finds these attitudes hard to deal with — and so do I. But it might not be a problem for too much longer. Even movie star looks fade. As he nears the end of his 30s, he has started to sprout random hairs from his ears, is growing wayward, Denis Healey eyebrows, and he is battling against the development of the family double chin. He is near-sighted, suffers from a bad back and his love for French food and wine means that he doesn’t have anything resembling a six pack. And for these flaws, I am truly thankful. The fact is I don’t love Mickael because he’s handsome, although it doesn’t hurt. I love him because he’s funny, kind and thoughtful. It’s when I’m lying in his arms, in the dark —  when I can’t see him — that I am at my most content. As the old proverb goes: ‘Handsome is as handsome does.’ I am absolutely certain that if he lost his looks tomorrow, I’d love him as much as ever.

"By . Martin Robinson . The wife of a British captain has blamed the Army for a miscarriage she suffered while her husband was stationed in Kenya. Katherine Howe, 38, said the stress of being forced to move to Nairobi after two pregnancy scares led to the death of her unborn daughter Harriet at 22 weeks. Mrs Howe and her husband Captain David Howe insist doctors said she needed to rest at a training camp but the Army said she had to travel the 150 miles back to the capital for a flight home. A week later she miscarried in hospital, where Harriet's body was but in an orange plastic bag and thrown away before the couple had sufficient time to say goodbye. Tragedy: The wife of an officer based at the British camp at Nanyuki in Kenya (pictured) has blamed the army for a miscarriage she suffered after she was asked to move back to Nairobi after a scare . They complained about their treatment in November 2011 and the Ministry of Defence is yet to respond two-and-a-half years later, claiming it is still investigating what happened. 'Ultimately we hold the army responsible for the death of our daughter,' Mrs Howe told The Times, adding: 'I feel totally let down.' Mrs Howe said she had stayed silent because she feared her husband's career could be harmed. But because their complaint remains unresolved she has chosen to explain why they feel failed. Anger: Mrs Howe says that she should never have been moved from Nanyuki to Nairobi . Captain Howe, from Wiltshire, was sent to Kenya in 2010 and his wife and their two-year-old son also came. Mrs Howe fell pregnant in March 2011 and she said they asked the army what their policy on pregnancy was in Kenya and if they were going to be moved - but claim they had no clear answer. While based at a camp at Nanyuki, close to Mount Kenya, she suffered a bleed at 19 weeks, the second of her pregnancy, and said a consultant told her to rest for a week. But she said the army told them they would be moved the three hours back to Nairobi within 48 hours for a flight back to the UK, but she lost the baby. Her husband lodged a formal complaint in November 2011, which is still unresolved. An army spokesman said: 'The army has offered its sincere apologies for the delay in dealing with the family's complaint but whilst the case is still under investigation it would be inappropriate to comment further'.","Katherine Howe, 38, say stress of moving after scare led to miscarriage .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Four women who were raped by a high-powered Seattle attorney have sued both him and his wife. Danford . Grant admitted to raping five women and is currently locked up at a . Shelton state prison where he is serving a 25-year jail sentence and is . expected to spend most of the rest of his life. The four women who were masseuses says they suffered physical and emotional injuries at Grant’s hands. The victims wrote letters that were read at his sentencing in May detailing how Grant's crimes had devastated their lives. Indefensible: Danford Grant pleaded guilty to rape and was sentenced to 25 years on Monday May 19 . Co-accomplice? Grant's wife, Jennifer may have tampered with evidence in the rape case against her husband, Danford. She is also being sued in the lawsuit launched by the four raped women . The . emotional statements prompted Judge William Downing to say of the . victims, 'Their strength is as formidable as their innocence is . unsullied.' Grant . plead guilty to the crimes. Had his case gone to trial, it was expected . that his defense attorneys would have argued that he engaged in paid, . consensual sex with the victims. The ladies say it is the harm that Grant caused which gives them cause to make a legal claim. The lawsuit also takes aim at Grants' wife Jennifer who was a 'co-conspirator' in the attacks. Grant, a married father of three . children, worked as an employment and business litigator and was a . founding member of his own law firm. He raped five women in a series of assaults in the summer and fall of 2012. 'Violent rapist': The sentence is exceptionally high. Grant now faces a lawsuit from four of the five women who were attacked . Scene of the crime: This is the Greenwood massage parlor room where Danford Grant raped a masseuse . Evidence: Grant was caught on camera thanks to a camera inside one of the massage parlor rooms where the rape took place . Grant was described by police as a serial rapist, 'obsessed with Asian women,' who preyed on immigrant masseuses. Grant was . arrested in September 2012 following a series of sexual assaults on . massage therapists in Seattle, Shoreline and Bellevue in 2011 and 2012. He . targeted the minority women, knowing they would have difficulty . reporting the crime because of language barriers and cultural attitudes . surrounding sex. Police . were investigating reports of a client raping Asian masseuses in . Seattle when Grant was apprehended by a bystander in Seattle as he . attempted to flee a massage parlor in September 2012. Investigators . found that Grant's modus operandi was to go to Asian-run massage . businesses after making an appointment under a fake name and using . different phone numbers. He . would lull the masseuse into a false sense of security by acting . politely and mentioning his position as an attorney or even lying that . he was a police officer or doctor to bolster his stature. He would sometimes lie that his wife was dead and profess love for the masseuse before asking for sex. Traumatic: Danford Grant stalked Asian masseuses online and then raped them violently during or after appointments he scheduled under false names . When the masseuse denied his request, he would violently attack her, often at knife-point, and try to rape her. Investigators . discovered he would research massage businesses online and find out . personal information about the massage therapists. None of the women came to his sentencing but them women have all stated how their lives have been destroyed. 'I really . wanted to be present during the court proceedings, but I did not have . the courage to see this person again. When I saw him on the news on May . 5th, my entire body trembled and I lost strength in all limbs,' wrote . one. She . continued that she is now always scared, suffers panic attacks and . becomes terrified if she sees a man on the street who resembles Grant. 'I . will never forget about the humiliation, the dark shadow, and the . trauma that this incident has brought upon me and I will be entangled in . these feelings for the rest of my life,' she wrote. One . woman told her husband she had been attacked with a knife, not . divulging that she had also been raped, so great was her shame and . distress. His plans: Grant used to tell the women he was a police office or some other high-powered job in order to make them fear him and the possibility of deportation . 'It . has been 22 long months since the incident happened to me... I now . suspect every male customer... Any small sudden motion by them will . trigger me to think they are getting up to attack me. I'm particularly . fearful of the ones who appear well-mannered and friendly because they . would remind me of the bastard who tried to rape me,' she wrote. In one . instance, Grant followed a masseuse back to her car after receiving a . massage and ordered her into the the vehicle before driving somewhere . secluded and raping her in the back seat. In . another, he returned to a business where he had previously tried to . rape a masseuse and forced his way in when he was denied entry before . raping the masseuse. One . victim said that she had undertaken many months of study to become a . massage therapist and was horrified when she discovered that Grant's . attorneys intended to argue that the women prostituted themselves. 'I read articles in the news and some reader's comments that said these were 'just Asian prostitutes.' Then the defense lawyer said this was consensual sex and prostitution. It made me sick to my stomach... [To become a professional therapist] I . did everything that Washington state requires here. I spent a lot of . time and I worked very hard to complete school... I am a good, moral . woman and I strictly respect my career as a massage therapist and skin . care professional,' she wrote. The . husband of one victim also wrote a statement, describing coming home to . find his wife on the floor in the fetal position in the aftermath of . the attack. 'Heroic': Letters from victims of the former Seattle lawyer Danford Grant are read aloud during his sentencing, prompting the judge to comment that 'Their strength is as formidable as their innocence is unsullied' He was . finally caught after raping a masseuse at knife-point at a Greenwood spa . when the owner and others arrived as he was leaving. A struggle ensued and police found him two blocks away from the parlor. A . victim wrote that she weeps in the middle of the night and cannot bring . herself to use a small knife in the kitchen because it looks similar to . the knife Grant threatened her with. During . one of the attacks, Grant’s car – a Honda Pilot – had been parked . nearby when he was arrested but was later moved by his wife, a former . prosecutor with the city of Seattle. When police finally searched the SUV, detectives claim to have seized a replica pistol, a bag of Viagra and various electronics. Jennifer . Grant removed an office key card and her husband’s wedding ring from . the SUV which he had left in the cars he went to rape a masseuse. Investigators . even found that Grant had searched the internet for 'rape scenes' and . even visited a website documenting such ideas. Lasting trauma: Grant targeted the women because he believed their language barrier and awe at his stature as well as shame and embarrassment would prevent them coming forward . Having initially denied the allegations, Grant ultimately admitted to raping the women. At his sentencing, Grant himself read a long letter in which he detailed his past problems with addictions and 'commercial sex.' 'Although, . the truth about what I did is dramatically different from what was . alleged, I do not minimize my real wrongs and my apology for those . particular wrongs is genuine and heartfelt,' he said. He . painted himself as a dutiful husband and father and said he came to . commit his crimes because he suffered anxierty and depression and . 'commercial sex' was a way to escape his problems and 'distorted' his . thinking. Neither Grant nor his wife have yet responded to the lawsuit.","Danford Grant, 49, was sentenced to 25 years for raping five Asian massage therapist in 2011 and 2012 .

The show's host Amitabh Bachchan, known as Big B in India, praised Sonali's bravery in appearing on the show. He said: 'Denied justice, she pleaded publicly to end her life. Denied that too because euthanasia is illegal in the country, she decided not to remain silent and suffer. 'Her story is one of immense courage. Desperate: Sonali, pictured worshipping at a Sikh temple earlier this month, wrote to the Indian Government earlier this year threatening to kill herself if she didn't receive any state funding for treatment . 'The nation salutes her as do all of us, but simultaneously hangs its head in shame for this dastardly act.' Sonali, who has undergone surgery 22 times since the 2003 attack, said that the win was the perfect treatment for her wounds. She was a promising student in her hometown of Dhanbad, in the eastern Indian Jharkhand region, at the time of the attack, which saw her doused in a chemical called Tezaab, normally used to clean rusted tools. Her attackers broke into her home and poured acid on her as she slept. She remains partially blind and deaf as a result of her injuries. Since then she has received no state funding for her treatment and earlier this year she wrote to the Indian Government threatening to kill herself if she did not receive state aid. Courage: Sonali, who was a promising student before the attack in 2003, was praised by the show's host Amitabh Bachchan for her bravery . Special episode: Sonali appeared on a special edition of Who Wants to be a Millionaire? which featured contestants who had shown courage in the face of adversity . Her attackers are currently out on bail after serving just four months in jail with no one ever properly convicted of the crime. Sonali's winnings will pay for the next round of plastic surgery but she is still appealing for donations to help fund further operations once the money has run out. Scarred: Sonali has undergone 22 operations since the 2003 attack which saw her lose most of her facial features. She is partially blind and deaf as a result of her injuries. Her family have had to sell ancestral land, her mother's jewellery and had run out of money for further treatment before her win. The series of operations and consultations that Sonali has endured have already cost hundreds of thousands of rupees. She says that it will cost an estimated £1.5million rupees for her to look 'even remotely human' and to have her eyesight restored. Earlier this year some Rs 30 lakh was raised by Mumbai-based company Beti as part of Project Hope which aims to give Sonali a new identity. Celebrities such as Bollywood actress Juhi Chawla and producer Ramesh Tauran also donated funds to the appeal. The former NCC Cadet was allegedly sexually abused for years by her attackers and was studying sociology honours while juggling a job at the time of the attack. Her family were forced to flee Dhanbad and her mother fell into a deep depression. Her father Chandi Das Mukherjee said, 'We appealed in the high court... Nothing happened. They were sent to jail but were released soon after... Now they are busy enjoying their lives.' 'The law against acid attackers needs to be made tougher. Otherwise we will have many more Sonalis.' The show, which is called Kaun Banega Crorepati and is in its sixth series, was famously featured in Oscar winning Danny Boyle film Slumdog Millionaire. Sonali's appearance came as part of a one off show called Doosra Mauka, or Second Chance, which featured contestants who have shown courage in the face of adversity. Tragic: Sonali walks with her father Chandi Das Mukherjee at her home in New Delhi. Her attackers have never been brought to justice with three spending several months in jail before being released. Increase: Acid attacks against women such as Sonali Mukherjee are said to be on the rise in India . India is the fourth most dangerous place for women to live according to a survey from the Thomas Reuters Foundation, with acid attacks reportedly on the rise. There are no official figures for acid attacks in the country, though much attention has been given to the issue in the press. A lobby group in Karnataka, Campaign and Struggle Against Acid Attacks, claims that there have been around 70 attacks in that state alone in the last decade. Suck attacks are most commonly an act of revenge on women who refuse an offer of marriage from a man or who ask for a divorce with National Geographic claiming that such attacks are used in modern India to enforce the Caste system. Indian acid attack survivor Shirin Junaley set up the Plash Foundation to offer support to fellow sufferers of acid attacks. Previously, women have received no state support following such attacks and the police are said to have been notoriously slow to punish the perpetrators. But the Indian Government is currently considering financial aid for victims of rape and acid attacks. The funding is to be used for medical aid, rehabilitation and counselling.","Sonali Mukherjee, 27, was left disfigured following the 2003 attack .

Police from Scotland Yard haul a large tarpaulin over a hole as they continue to work at the scene . Portuguese authorities were today reported to have finally given the go-ahead for British officers to quiz them. The development came as officers completed their first week of painstaking searches of scrubland 300 yards from the Ocean Club resort where Madeleine holidayed with her family in May 2007. Madeleine’s parents Kate, 46, and Gerry, 45, have not travelled to Portugal but are being kept closely informed. Yesterday, they said they are 'encouraged by the progress'‎ of searches for their missing daughter. ‎Writing on the couple's official Find Madeleine Facebook page, they added: 'Thank you for continuing to stand by us and supporting our efforts to get Madeleine home.' ‎Earlier this year, Britain's most senior police officer said Scotland Yard was closing in on the people who abducted Madeleine McCann.

"By . Martin Robinson . A second baby fed with a contaminated hospital drip died today - although officials believe it may not have been poisoned. The unnamed newborn was one of 22 babies being cared for amid fears they had or might developed blood poisoning at neonatal intensive care units in England. Nine-day-old Yousef Al-Kharboush died on June 1 after contracting a bacterial infection at St Thomas' Hospital in London. The . contaminated products supplied by London-based pharmaceutical firm ITH . Pharma had been sent to a total of 22 hospitals. New tragedy: A second baby fed on a contaminated drip died today, ten days after nine-day-old Yousef Al-Kharboush died in the premature unit at St Thomas' Hospital in London . In . a statement Public Health England, who is investigating, said: 'Another . baby has sadly died but this does not appear to be related to the . bacillus cereus infection'. Scandal: The babies were fed on a drip because they were too premature to feed, but became ill after being given an infected batch (file picture) Details . of the hospital the baby was in when the death occurred cannot be . released for confidentiality reasons, a PHE spokesman said. But it is . known that cases have been recorded at 10 hospitals across England. Speaking at a pre-inquest review last week, Yousef's father Raaid Hassan Sakkijha said: 'My son has just died. I don't want more children to. 'I was hoping to hear this product would be completely stopped from production until they make sure that ... no other babies are being contaminated. 'I won't have a baby in the next nine months but I hope other people who have babies will be safe.' Affected hospitals include Chelsea and . Westminster NHS Trust, The Whittington Hospital, Brighton & Sussex . University Hospital NHS Trust and Stoke Mandeville Hospital. The children were given a batch of a fluid called parenteral nutrition, which is supposed to deliver a variety of nutrients intravenously when a baby is unable to eat on its own. Professor Mike Catchpole, PHE incident . director, said investigations suggest liquids in the drips were . contaminated in one day. He also confirmed those liquid products are no . longer in circulation. 'Investigations to date have suggested . the source of the Bacillus cereus infection that has affected outbreak . cases was the contamination of intravenous liquid products during a . single day of production, which are no longer in circulation,' he said. 'PHE . is continuing to work with the MHRA on this investigation and to ensure . all possible lessons from this serious incident are identified.' Upsetting: 11 hospitals in England were affected. The Rosie Hospital based at Addebrooke's in Cambridge now has three cases, a rise from the two investigators had previously linked to the contaminated drips . The PHE said there have been no new infections since June 2. Currently there are 18 confirmed cases of infection, and a further four possible cases. The supplier of the fluid, London-based pharmaceutical firm ITH Pharma, said last week that the suspected contamination had been traced to a 'sourced' single raw material ingredient. ITH Pharma managing director Karen Hamling said she was 'deeply saddened' by the death of Yousef Al-Kharboush and illness of other babies. 'As a mother, as a pharmacist , as someone who has worked for 30 years in healthcare, inside and outside the NHS, I am deeply saddened that one baby has died and others have fallen ill from septicaemia,' she said.","Unnamed newborn may not have had blood poisoning, experts say .

"By . Associated Press . Accused: Baseel Abdul-Amir Saad. Saad is a Detroit-area soccer player who police say critically injured a referee by punching him during a match on Sunday . A Detroit-area soccer player faces a felony assault charge for allegedly punching a referee during an adult-league match, critically injuring the ref. Baseel Abdul-Amir Saad was arraigned Monday in Livonia District Court on a charge of assault with intent to do great bodily harm. Bond was set at $500,000, and a probable-cause hearing was set for July 10. Saad's lawyer, Brian Berry, said his client is cooperating with police and is not guilty of the charge. Saad punched the unnamed referee in . the head after the referee indicated he planned to eject the 36-year-old . Dearborn resident from a game Sunday at Mies Park, Livonia police Lt. Tom Goralski said. Joseph Cosenza, an opposing player, says Saad had left the park by the time police arrived. 'He got away, took off with one of his buddies, jumped in their car. ... A couple of our players were able to take pictures of the car and the license plate. Took off. The cops found the car and the driver,' he told Fox 2 News. He says Saad tripped another player and it looked as though he punched the referee in the throat and under the chin, knocking him out and causing a head injury. The referee was in critical condition Monday afternoon, authorities said. Saad wasn't at the field when police arrived, Goralski said. The lieutenant said Saad surrendered Monday. Berry questioned whether his client was the reason for the referee's injuries. Referee Mr Bieniewicz, in yellow, was punched in the head after he indicated he planned to send a player off during Sunday's game . Police have released the 911 call made by a woman who witnessed the incident at the soccer match on Sunday . 'As . the case progresses we expect to learn the cause of the referee's . injuries,' the lawyer said in an email. 'I can further state that Mr. Saad cooperated with the police investigation and voluntarily turned . himself in to the Livonia Police Department to stand trial for the . charges he is faced with.

"By . Martin Robinson . and Andrew Levy . On the rolling greens of the genteel Aldeburgh golf club, the talk is  usually of turf and tees. That is, until it was rocked by allegations of inappropriate behaviour between married members – and claims of an ‘Ayatollah’ at the helm. That is the damning judgment of an employment tribunal, which accused the club of conducting a ‘witch hunt’ against a well-regarded employee, and ordered it to pay £50,000 in compensation. Victim: Margaret Chadwick (left) was sacked . after raising concerns about the relationship between a golf club . secretary and a married female member. Bill Beckett (right) refutes allegations of inappropriate behaviour . It . labelled club secretary Bill Beckett an ‘overbearing and aggressive . . . . Ayatollah’, while former club captain Steve Beaumont was branded . ‘ignorant and naive’. The . trouble started when rumours swept the club that ‘something happened’ between Mr Beckett, 69, and a married member, Juliet Brereton, 73, at a . party. Days . later, assistant secretary Margaret Chadwick claimed to have seen Mrs . Brereton – who is married to Phil, 81 – pinching Mr Beckett’s bottom. Her submission stated that Mrs Brereton told him: ‘Bill, everyone loved . the barbecue and I loved squeezing your bottom. Let me squeeze  it . again.’ Mrs . Chadwick, 58, quietly discussed the incident and its impact on the . 130-year-old Suffolk club with senior members. But when details leaked . out, she was escorted from the premises – and two months later, . dismissed. Mrs Chadwick, who was given the compensation for unfair . dismissal,  yesterday said she was pleased at the outcome but had been . through a ‘terrible ordeal’. ‘I’m not jumping for joy – I would rather have kept my job. But here we are and at least justice has been done,’ she said. Mrs . Chadwick had worked at the club – England’s second oldest heath course – . since May 2008 and received no complaints until Mr Beckett took over in . April 2012. Within weeks she felt ‘criticised and bullied’, and in June 2012 was given a written warning to turn around her performance. She . went to then club captain Mr Beaumont and made a formal complaint. The . tribunal in Bury St Edmunds heard that he replied: ‘I do not regard Bill . Beckett’s behaviour to you as bullying and there has been no physical . violence.’ Scandal: Mrs Chadwick was escorted from Aldeburgh Golf Club in Suffolk and later sacked after she said she saw Bill Beckett have his bottom squeezed by a female member, a tribunal found . Mrs . Chadwick was later accused of making ‘unprofessional and unfounded . remarks’ and ‘escorted’ from the £1,000-a-year club. She was sacked in . October 2012. The tribunal heard Mr Beckett and Mrs Brereton ‘categorically, vehemently and consistently’ deny acting inappropriately. The . club accused Mrs Chadwick of spreading rumours to discredit her boss. But employment judge Robin Postle said its investigation was ‘one-sided’ and its findings ‘irrational and unreasonable’. It . was ‘not unreasonable’ for Mrs Chadwick, a mother of one who is married . to solicitor Richard, 68, to raise concerns about rumours of . inappropriate behaviour being ‘openly discussed within the club’ – . particularly as similar allegations had engulfed a previous secretary. Judge Postle added: ‘One cannot get away from the feeling that the . claimant was the victim of nothing short of a witch hunt.’ Mrs . Brereton, who runs a guest house in Aldeburgh, last night insisted the . claims were ‘made up’. She said: ‘A new club secretary arrived with a . new way of doing things and she didn’t like it. Her husband is involved . with the law and perhaps she saw a way to make some money.’ Mr . Beckett could not be contacted but the club said it had ‘full . confidence’ in him. Captain Tim Rowan-Robinson said the tribunal was . ‘disappointing’, adding: ‘The club refutes claims over secretary Bill . Beckett’s behaviour, which was fully investigated at the time.’ Hearing: A judge at a tribunal in Bury St Edmunds said that Mrs Chadwick had been the victim of a 'witch hunt'","Margaret Chadwick victim of 'witch hunt' at Aldeburgh Golf Club, Suffolk .

"By . Paul Bentley In Praia Da Luz . and Martin Robinson . and Kieran Corcoran . Police hunting for Madeleine McCann have today started searching Praia da Luz's sewer network as it emerged they need at least another week to scour land 300 metres from where she vanished. Scotland Yard detectives working in the Algarve resort have pulled up manhole covers and are analysing the network of pipes below using micro cameras and fibre-optic cables. Police have yet to say whether they have found anything significant, but Madeleine's parents - Kate and Gerry McCann - today said they were 'encouraged by the progress' of the search. Scroll down for video . New phase: Police also inspected sewers under wasteland minutes from where Madeleine was last seen . Manhole covers were lifted and cameras dropped down to survey the complex network of pipes . Discovery: The hole has been been subject to intense police investigation since it was discovered on Wednesday. It is believed to have been used by children playing in the area for years . The sewer system being searched was installed as part of failed plans . to build a hotel on the site before Madeleine disappeared in 2007, but after a planning battle it remained wasteland. The search of the area for clues to what happened to the three-year-old from Leicestershire is expected to go into a second week after British police were granted an extra seven days by the Portuguese authorities to keep searching. Sources said detectives had not realised just how hard and dry the land would be where they have been digging for clues. The extension may also have been granted after surprise finds at the first site, where a large concealed shaft was discovered by sniffer dogs. The hole has now been cleared after forensic teams removed ‘non organic’ materials from inside. Local reports suggested clothing had been found in what was a discarded play den for children. Officers also believed they had come . across a burial site late on Wednesday but this has since reportedly . been ruled out as an area of interest. Bones have been discovered on the . site but tests showed they were from cows and pigs. Scotland Yard has refused to provide . ‘a running commentary’ on whether any leads have so far been found. Experienced: Seven-year-old English springer spaniels 'Tito and Muzzy' from South Wales Police, who helped hunt for April Jones, were back on the land for a fourth day . Hot work: The dogs were covered in water and a wet blanket as their handlers ensure they did not overheat in the Algarve sun . However, Mr and Mrs McCann today wrote online to well-wishers saying they are 'encouraged by the progress'‎ of searches for their missing daughter. ‎Writing . on the couple's official Find Madeleine Facebook page, Kate and Gerry . McCann said: 'We are kept updated on the on-going work in Portugal and . are encouraged by the progress. 'Thank you for continuing to stand by us and supporting our efforts to get Madeleine home.'‎ . Mr . and Mrs McCann, who have not travelled to Praia da Luz, were previously . said to have been bracing themselves for 'significant news'. Today a group of officers lifted a manhole cover and lowered what appeared to be a camera attached to a long pole down it. One of them wrote notes as they looked inside, around 20ft (6metres) from where the radar equipment was used yesterday. They then moved over to a section of grass nearby and lifted another cover, with an officer lying on his front on the ground to reach inside. Meanwhile sniffer dogs used to hunt for murdered schoolgirl April Jones were again on the site hunting for evidence. The seven-year-old English springer spaniels – Tito and Muzzy – can cover a far larger area than humans in much less time. Yesterday they uncovered  concealed shaft covered with corrugated iron, yards from the spot where Madeleine McCann vanished. Scotland Yard moved in to seal off the area with large white tents. Forensic approach: Police have split the wasteland into at least 12 areas of interest, using dogs, scanning equipment and fingertip searches . Vantage point: At the centre of the search site is a hill, where officers on horses and also with telescopes are taking advantage of the height to look for evidence . Five forensic officers were called in to start excavating the shaft and were seen removing several bags of evidence. The shaft had an opening measuring around 5ft by 3ft which was . covered with wooden planks, a large corrugated iron sheet and mounds of . earth. A . local source said: ‘The discovery of the hole came as a surprise. Police are meant to be here for five to seven days but this may delay . things.’ The . area is the size of three football pitches and is thought to contain at . least 12 key areas of interest which officers are planning to examine. It was chosen because a suspect who was carrying a young girl was seen . walking in the direction of the site on the night that Madeleine was . last seen alive. Investigation: Madeleine’s parents Kate, 46, and 45-year-old Gerry McCann have not travelled to Portugal but are being kept closely informed and are said to expect 'significant news' on their daughter .

VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rooney relaxing from football with a spot of golf with McIlroy . Jackpot: Wayne Rooney is set to sign a new deal with Manchester United worth £300,000-a-week . Home: Rooney and boss David Moyes (right) are back in Manchester after United's warm-weather trip to Dubai . Why the glum face? Rooney looked a little gloomy on the way to training at Carrington on Wednesday . Oh no. The matter exercising angst across the land - or rather however much of it is still above water - is the prospect of Wayne Rooney earning £300,000 a week. Now while this is an astonishing amount of money for anyone to be paid for kicking around a bladder full of wind, is it really such an outrage? This wage is not being paid from our taxes. Rather, it will generate a healthy sum for the Inland Revenue. Nor will it come from investors misled into subscribing to dodgy schemes by City fat cats. Rooney - assuming he signs his four-and-a-half-years (plus one) contract, and it is hard to think of a reason why he should not - is being offered roughly a fifty grand a week rise by his current employers. Manchester United feel pressed to make this gesture because their team are struggling somewhat right now and they need to convince potential recruits that they are in the business of regaining their status in Europe, no matter the cost. There will be fans of the club aghast at their generosity to a young man who has already held United to ransom twice by threatening to take his talent elsewhere, like Chelsea. Surrounded by problems: Rooney is a bright spark in a United team that is struggling under new boss Moyes . Sign here: It is United's fans that make Rooney's incredible new contract possible . But the harsh reality is that if supporters don’t like it they can stop buying their tickets. No-one can force them to go to Old Trafford. Anyway, what most of them are hoping is that Rooney is so grateful that he will drag United back to the top of the Premier and Champions Leagues by his golden boot-laces. Elsewhere in the football world many are goggling at so much dosh. Since this contract is being negotiated at the sensitive time when the English game has lost its finest ever player, the comparisons are acute. Now there has been no greater admirer of Sir Tom Finney than myself. I grew up watching him play whenever I got the chance and then became privileged to know him and spend time in his modest, charming and courteous company. And, yes, at £14 a week (£12 in a summer when there were no games so he could concentrate on being Preston’s most famous plumber) he like all his contemporaries was slavishly underpaid. But that is not Rooney’s fault. Not even when you looks at figures like these: that £14 in the mid-to-late 1950s, when Finney was at his peak with Preston and England, would be worth £267 today. So by that measure Rooney would expect £13,904 a year, not the £15.6million on the table. True gentleman, great footballer: Sir Tom Finney, who died last Friday and is pictured here playing his last game for Preston in April 1960, never earned more than £14-a-week during his professional playing career . Never forgotten: Jeff Powell walks with Sir Tom on the pitch at Deepdale in 2009 . Sir Tom’s career earnings with Preston . North End totalled less than two-thirds what Rooney will take home in a . week. And against the £194,656 (plus win bonuses) with which Finney’s 14 . years of uncomplaining one-club loyalty was rewarded, the 27-year-old . Rooney stands to bank £85.8m if he lasts the next five-and-a-half years . at United. It needs to be remembered that Finney was a pioneering campaigner for the betterment of professional footballers and did not resent the phenomenal incomes of the modern player. And he among many would argue that high earnings are infinitely preferable to the old maximum wage. Since football is very much part of the entertainment industry, there is no logical reason to differentiate between its own players and pop singers and film stars. And I for one believe Rooney brings more pleasure to the world than Justin Bieber. If the market rate is three hundred grand, so be it. Entertainers: Rooney is in the same industry as Justin Bieber, so their wages can be judged in comparison . Career-defining: Rooney's magnificent overhead kick secured victory against Manchester City in 2011 . Cut it out: Rooney and wife Coleen were pictured at Glastonbury Festival last summer . However, big money brings with it heavy responsibility. Rooney should feel an obligation to move heaven and earth to revitalise United and bring the feelgood factor back to Old Trafford. His is an important club to both football and modern society and the fans who are frustrated at the moment are the very people who make this contract possible. He is now in what should be the prime years of his career and needs to perform accordingly, consistently. The supporters may very well be hoping that certain demands, as well as a hefty fortune, are in the small print. For example, as a young man who tends to put on weight, would it be too much to ask that he tips the scales at a match-ready poundage at least once a week. There might also be lifestyle conditions. Like not zooming off to Las Vegas for mini-breaks, severely rationing trips to nightclubs and remembering that what he needs to be doing most for the next few, crucial years is training hard, eating sensibly and sleeping a lot. If such restraints are being applied then perhaps Sir Alex Ferguson, as a United director now, has had something to do with it. Certainly, as manager, he had no fear of reading the riot act to his best player. Hopefully now, as he matures, Rooney will realise that such discipline is as good for him as for his generous paymasters – and that it is time to deliver.

As first Manchester City and then Arsenal were beaten 2-0 at home by two of the mightiest clubs in Europe, they elected to blame the referees rather than search for reasons within themselves and their teams. Pellegrini faces a touchline ban for accusing the Swedish official of bias in favour of Barcelona. Gesture: Arsene Wenger (right) accused Arjen Robben (left) of diving to win a penalty against Arsenal . Pointing the finger: Manuel Pellegrini (second right) suggested that Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson was impartial during Manchester City's Champions League defeat against Barcelona on Tuesday night . Sorry, it was a sending off. And sorry again, when City captain Vincent Kompany admitted they gave their opponents too much respect he was right... and his manager was wrong to send them out in such a negative formation and mindset. Wenger will escape sanction for calling Bayern Munich’s Arjen Robben a diver. But sorry, the Bayern Munich man was cut down by Arsenal’s goalkeeper so it was a penalty - and in my view a sending off as well. Self destruction: Martin Demichelis's (bottom) clear foul on Lionel Messi deserved a red card . Rush of blood: Wojciech Szczesny's (left) foul on Robben was clear for all to see and also merited a sending-off . Now, playing against either Barca or Bayern with only 10 men is a monstrous task but it was not the fault of the men with the whistle that City and Arsenal had to do just that. We know it hurts to be as good as out of the most important club football competition in the world in the round of the last 16. But sometimes it behoves managers to put their hands up and admit they have been beaten by superior opponents, not wave their arms accusingly on the touchline in pathetic impersonations of Tom Daley as he takes off from the 10-metre board.","Wayne Rooney is set to seal new contract worth £300k per week .

"By . Graeme Yorke . Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino has revealed that Lionel Messi has been to see experts to determine why he has been vomiting during matches, but says there is no cause for alarm. Messi, 26, was sick on the pitch during Argentina's midweek friendly against Romania, and has been reported to have thrown up in other matches for his country and Barcelona previously. When asked about the subject on Friday, Martino admitted the bouts of vomiting were 'not normal' but played down the seriousness, adding that the issue has not been affecting the four-time World Player of the Year's ability to perform. Unwell: Lionel Messi was physically sick on the pitch during Argentina's draw against Romania . Under the weather: Messi reacts at the end of their international friendly  against Romania . Back to the day job: Messi trains with Barcelona ahead of the Real Valladolid game . 'I've spoken with him and it happens regularly. I'm not a specialist but I understand it's not something normal,' Martino said ahead of this weekend's Primera Division trip to Real Valladolid. 'He's even been to see specialists at certain times and a solution hasn't been found yet, but there's no cause for concern It doesn't affect him doing his work at all. It's something he's had for some time.' Martino also heaped praise on 'irreplaceable' defender Carles Puyol following the centre-back's decision to leave the Catalan giants. Puyol, 35, announced earlier this week that he would bid farewell to Barca at the end of the season after 19 years at the club in which he has made 593 first-team appearances - second only to current team-mate Xavi in the club's history - and helped them win 21 trophies. Martino said: 'I think he's a footballer who is irreplaceable. I'm probably not the best-placed person to comment on this, because I've only worked with him for seven or eight months, but that's enough to say what I said. In the spotlight: An irresponsible member of the crowd used a laser pointer to shine a light on Messi . On the ball: Messi takes on Romania's Aleksandru Bourceanu, Aleksandru Chipciu, Mihai Pintilii and Dragos Grigore . 'He's the type of player that a club has only once every so often. Life goes on at Barcelona, and the club will look for a replacement, but he'll always be in everyone's heads because he leaves an indelible mark.' Puyol admits he does not know what his next step will be - save to take a bit of a break in the summer - but Martino has played down suggestions that the centre-back, who has won 100 caps for Spain, might immediately try his hand at football management. 'It's not that I don't see him as a coach, I've thought that he could, but he told me he's not looking there, at least now,' Martino said.","Messi was sick during Argentina's friendly with Romania .

Shocking: A Romanian father has been awarded temporary custody of his two-year-old toddler after his ex-wife reportedly posted a video of their daughter smoking cigarettes . The couple split up a year ago but full custody of the young girl was awarded to Elena Ursu, 28. It is now believed that Mr Burulea has been awarded temporary custody of the child following the release of the video.

But now terrifying footage has emerged capturing exactly what it would be like to be stuck on board a vessel as it goes down - slowly disappearing into the deep as waves crash all around.

We're going down: Very quickly the ship begins to tilt to the left, allowing the water to completely cover the deck . Eerie: The footage then becomes slightly unsteady and the water fills with bubbles - both of which gives the terrifying impression of someone gasping for air as they are sucked below the surface . The footage begins with The Pocahontas appearing to take on a small amount of water as it sails on a relatively calm Lake Worth. The more water the ship takes on, the heavier it becomes, pushing the vessel increasingly lower until water begins lapping over its sides. Very quickly the ship begins to tilt to the left, allowing the water to almost completely cover the deck. The sheer weight of the water continues to drag the port side of the ship down, and within seconds the camera itself is under water. The footage then becomes slightly unsteady and the water fills with bubbles - both of which gives the terrifying impression of someone gasping for air as they are sucked below the surface. After several disorientating moments of the camera being struck by debris, the footage eventually settles into an eerie calm as the ship appears to come to a rest on the bed of the lake. The video then cuts to another camera positioned inside what appears to be the ship's hull. Although dimly lit, several shards of daylight force their way into the hull - letting the viewer know that the footage is once again back before the ship sunk. The vessel begins to rock however, and after one particularly large lurch forward water begins gushing into the interior - filling it from floor to ceiling in little over a second.

"By . Beezy Marsh . A girl of seven with Down’s Syndrome has been chosen from hundreds of hopefuls as the face of a major children’s clothing campaign. The decision by Sainsbury’s to use Natty Goleniowska to advertise school uniforms is a step  forward in making children with the condition more accepted, say campaigners. Natty, from Padstow, Cornwall, will star in the Back To School campaign online, in stores and in magazines later this summer. 'Big step forward': Natalia 'Natty' Goleniowska, seven, has Down's Syndrome and has won the star role in a new advertising campaign for Sainsbury's . Her mother Hayley Goleniowska, 43, a former language teacher, who runs campaign group Down’s Side Up, said: ‘We are delighted that so many people will now see that Natty is just a lovely, bright and cheerful little girl. ‘As a mum, I have worried about the fact that there are not that many images out there featuring children like her, so this is a big step forward.’ Two children a day are born with Down’s Syndrome in Britain, although around 1,000 babies are terminated a year, due to advances in prenatal screening, which mean the majority of cases are picked up earlier in pregnancy. It is estimated that around 60,000 people with Down’s Syndrome are living in the UK. Proud: Natty Goleniowska with her mother Hayley, 43 . Mrs Goleniowska, of Padstow, whose older daughter Mia is free of the condition, had no idea she was carrying a baby with Down’s until Natty, short for Natalia, was born. ‘For me, the realities of Down’s syndrome today are of the independence that is possible and the huge benefits that we all reap from being inclusive and accepting different ways of living. Most of all it is understanding what those with learning disabilities contribute huge amounts to their communities,’ she said. ‘Natalia is simply our daughter, a cake lover, swimming addict and annoying little sister. 'Our lived reality doesn’t even begin to overlap the stereotyped image that my ignorant subconscious created before, from all the outdated glimpses into the lives of adults with the condition when I was a child.’ James Brown, Sainsbury’s Non-Food Trading Director said: ‘We are delighted to work with Natty and are looking forward to seeing her in the Back to School campaign in August.’ A spokeswoman from the Down’s Syndrome Association, said last night: . ‘There does seem to be a sea-change going on at the moment in attitudes towards children with Down’s Syndrome and this a very positive thing. Anyone looking at pictures of Natty can see she is just delightful. ‘In a way, it is great not to make a fuss of it because to most school children, seeing a child with Down’s Syndrome in school is now part of everyday life. The fact that children like Natty are being included in advertising is very powerful.’ Other stores have also used children with Down’s Syndrome in advertising in the past year. Marks and Spencer used six-year-old Seb White, of Bath, in a Christmas catalogue and Natty has modelled for JoJo Maman Bebe in the past. Seb White’s mother Caroline, 40, who took matters into her own hands and complained to M&S that there were no children like her son in any of its adverts, said last night: ‘For me, It is crucial to have children with Down’s Syndrome in Back to School campaigns because it is inclusive. When it was our turn to start school, there were no pictures of kids like Seb there, and we were just as excited to buying his school uniform as anybody else.’","Natty Goleniowska from Padstow, Cornwall has Down's Syndrome .

"By . Martin Robinson . Tragedy: Ayden Keenan-Olson's mother believes he was 'bullied to death' as an inquest was held today . A mother admitted today 'I could not keep my own son safe' as an inquest heard her teenage boy researched suicide online before taking his own life after years of bullying. Ayden Keenan-Olson, 14, was found dead in his bed by his father, Tim Olson, at the family home in Colchester, Essex, at 7.20am on March 14. He had taken an overdose of prescription drugs and left two suicide notes outlining the homophobic and racist bullying he had experienced at the town's Philip Morant School, an inquest in Chelmsford heard. A police investigation found that, in the . month leading up to his death, Ayden had bypassed settings on his . computer to research suicide methods on the internet. After his death Ayden's mother, author and prominent child abuse campaigner Shy Keenan, said he had been 'bullied to death'. Mrs Keenan told the inquest: 'My job is to protect kids online but I could not keep my own son safe.' Afterwards, she said she and fellow campaigner Dr Sara Payne would lobby for a new law to safeguard children online. Saying she hoped to meet with Google bosses to discuss the issue, Mrs Keenan added: 'We have to change the laws in this country to protect children. 'We must remove suicide websites from the internet - it's got to happen. We can't have young people taking their own lives whenever they face problems or difficulties.' Mrs Keenan told the inquest: 'My job is to protect kids online but I could not keep my own son safe.' Essex coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray recorded that Ayden's death was the result of suicide. The inquest heard Ayden had attempted to take his own life six months earlier and the family believe he took prescription drugs from home and hid them at school. The school's headteacher confirmed Ayden reported up to 20 incidents of bullying since joining the school. Mrs Beasley-Murray said it was not her job to attribute blame and she made no finding regarding bullying or the school's conduct. Bereft: Shy Keenan and Tim Olson outside Chelmsford Civic Centre today, where Ayden's mother said her job is now to protect other children because she could not protect her's . Referring to suicide websites, she said: 'The court regrets the influence that such sites have on young people. 'He clearly was much loved and had so much going for him and I hope you can look back on the happy memories that you have of him.' Mrs Keenan, who was escorted by her husband and by fellow campaigner Sara Payne, told the hearing her son had been bullied for several years and previously attempted to take his life in October last year. Breaking down in tears during her evidence, she said her son had been targeted with violence, abuse and malicious allegations because fellow pupils believed he was gay and because he had part-Japanese ethnicity. Shortly before Christmas he told his family he thought he was gay. Mrs Keenan said: 'He said he was gay and had found somebody he thought he loved but it was not reciprocated. 'We didn't care, we just loved him whatever. 'After Christmas it was like talking to a different boy - since he was able to say out loud to people that he was gay.' She described Ayden as a sensitive child who had planned to start his own anti-bullying campaign. He was a keen musician and idolised television presenter Gok Wan. 'People would call him Gok as a compliment,' she said. 'He tried very hard to look like him.' Support: A flurry of tributes were sent to the grieving mother, who is a high profile child abuse campaigner, and posted this picture of him on her Twitter page . Police found Ayden's bedroom littered with medication packaging alongside an empty bottle of red wine. His laptop search history showed he had researched how to commit suicide and how to write a suicide note. The family had blocked inappropriate websites from the computer but he found a way of bypassing this, the inquest heard. Since his earlier suicide attempt, the family had kept medication locked away but it is thought he retained some the previous occasion. Giving evidence, acting headteacher Robert James defended the school's policies for dealing with bullying. 'As a school, our first priority is to make sure our students are safe,' Mr James said.

Marrocco wheels himself into a news conference followed by surgeons, (from left, W.P. Andrew Lee, M.D., Jamie Shores M.D., Patrick L. Basile M.D. and Gerald Brandacher M.D.) on Tuesday, January 29th 2013 at Johns Hopkins hospital in Baltimore . Marrocco also received bone marrow from the same donor to minimize the medicine needed to prevent rejection. He said he didn't know much about the donor but 'I'm humbled by their gift.' The 13-hour operation on December 18th was led by Dr. W.P. Andrew Lee, plastic surgery chief at Hopkins.- . Marrocco was being released from the hospital Tuesday but will receive intensive therapy for two years at Hopkins and then at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda. After a major surgery, human nerves regenerate at a rate of an inch per month, Lee said. 'The progress will be slow, but the outcome will be rewarding,' he added. The infantryman also received bone marrow from the same dead donor who supplied his new arms. That novel approach is aimed at helping his body accept the new limbs with minimal medication to prevent rejection. The military sponsors operations like these to help wounded troops. About 300 have lost arms or hands in Iraq or Afghanistan. W.P. Andrew Lee, M.D. talks about the bilateral arm transplant on Infantryman Brendan M. Marocco during the news conference today . Unlike a life-saving heart or liver transplant, limb transplants are aimed at improving quality of life, not extending it. Quality of life is a key concern for people missing arms and hands — prosthetics for those limbs are not as advanced as those for feet and legs. 'He was the first quad amputee to survive,' and there have been four others since then, Alex Marrocco said. The Marroccos want to thank the donor's family for 'making a selfless decision ... making a difference in Brendan's life,' the father said. Brendan Marrocco has been in public many times. During a July 4 visit last year to the Sept. 11 Memorial with other disabled soldiers, he said he had no regrets about his military service. 'I wouldn't change it in any way. ... I feel great. I'm still the same person,' he said. Lee led three of those earlier operations when he worked at the University of Pittsburgh, including the only above-elbow transplant that had been done at the time, in 2010. Marrocco's 'was the most complicated one' so far, Lee said in an interview Monday. It will take more than a year to know how fully Marrocco will be able to use the new arms. 'The maximum speed is an inch a month for nerve regeneration,' he explained. 'We're easily looking at a couple years' until the full extent of recovery is known. While at Pittsburgh, Lee pioneered the immune-suppression approach used for Marrocco. The surgeon led hand-transplant operations on five patients, giving them marrow from their donors in addition to the new limbs. All five recipients have done well, and four have been able to take just one anti-rejection drug instead of combination treatments most transplant patients receive. Minimizing anti-rejection drugs is important because they have side effects and raise the risk of cancer over the long term. Those risks have limited the willingness of surgeons and patients to do more hand, arm and even face transplants. Lee has received funding for his work from AFIRM, the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine, a cooperative research network of top hospitals and universities around the country that the government formed about five years ago. With government money, he and several other plastic surgeons around the country are preparing to do more face transplants, possibly using the new immune-suppression approach.

Brendan Marrocco relaxes on duty in Iraq before his devastating accident in April 2009 . Marrocco expects to spend three to four months at Hopkins, then return to a military hospital to continue physical therapy, his father said. Before the operation, he had been fitted with prosthetic legs and had learned to walk on his own. He had been living with his older brother in a specially equipped home on New York's Staten Island that had been built with the help of several charities. Shortly after moving in, he said it was 'a relief to not have to rely on other people so much.' The home was heavily damaged by Superstorm Sandy last fall. Despite being in a lot of pain for some time after the operation, Marrocco showed a sense of humor, his father said. He had a hoarse voice from the tube that was in his throat during the long surgery and decided he sounded like Al Pacino. He soon started doing movie lines. 'He was making the nurses laugh,' Alex Marrocco said.","Brendan Marrocco lost all four limbs in roadside blast in Iraq in April, 2009 .

"By . Associated Press . Prosecutors and a Phoenix woman reached a deal on Friday that would allow her to avoid prosecution for leaving her two young sons alone in a hot car while she was at a job interview. Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery said his office and 35-year-old Shanesha Taylor have an agreement under which he'll dismiss two felony child abuse charges against her if she meets several conditions. Those include completing parenting and substance abuse treatment programs and establishing education and child care trust funds for her children. Shanesha Taylor, 35, (pictured in her police mugshot) has reached a deal with prosecutors today to dismiss felony child abuse charges against her if she completes parenting and substance abuse treatment programs . Authorities arrested Taylor after bystanders in Scottsdale reported seeing her two sons alone in her car in March. Taylor told police that she wasn't able to find a babysitter for the boys, who were 2 years and 6 months old at the time. A witness found the infant crying hysterically and sweating profusely as temperatures inside the SUV exceeded 100 degrees. According to court documents, firefighters found the vehicle's windows rolled down an inch and no running air conditioning to keep the children cool. While Montgomery has said his focus was on how the children were treated, Taylor drew sympathy from people who saw her as a single mother trying to get work. An online fundraising website set up by a New Jersey woman brought in thousands of dollars in donations for her. Authorities arrested Taylor after bystanders in Scottsdale reported seeing her two sons alone in her car in March . 100F: Police claim the keys were in the ignition but the air conditioning was off, so the fan was blowing hot air . Montgomery called the agreement a 'just resolution' that holds Taylor accountable while serving the best interests of her family. Taylor, who previously pleaded not guilty to the charges, appeared in court Friday for what had been scheduled as a settlement conference. Judge Joseph Welty of Maricopa County Superior Court accepted the agreement but warned Taylor that it included an admission that she had endangered her children. That admission could be used against her if the case ends up being prosecuted in the future, the judge said. Taylor, who spoke little during the proceeding, acknowledged she understood what the judge said. In May, a court commissioner granted her visits with both children under the supervision of a Child Protective Services worker. She has been able to maintain steady visits since then, Taylor's defense lawyer Benjamin Taylor said. The two are not related. Shanesha Taylor has used some of the money to secure a new place to live, her lawyer said.","Shanesha Taylor, 35, will have two felony child abuse charges .

"By . James Chapman, Political Editor . and Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Pressure on Nick Clegg to quit as Lib Dem leader intensified last night after the party’s wipeout in the European elections. Following a catastrophic night, which cost him all but one of his MEPs, he was forced to admit he had lost the argument over Europe. In an emotional interview, in which his eyes appeared bloodshot, the Deputy Prime Minister said being beaten into fifth place by the Greens had been ‘gutting and heartbreaking’. But Mr Clegg found an unlikely ally this morning - in  Tony Blair. The former Prime Minister praised Mr Clegg's 'courage and leadership' in taking on Ukip. But Mr Blair added that the Lib Dems were still on course to be wiped out in next year's general election. Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, left his south London home this morning facing a barrage of questions over his leadership . Scroll down for video . Bloodshot: In an interview at Lib Dem HQ in London, Mr Clegg admitted it was 'gutting and heartbreaking' to come fifth in the European elections behind Ukip, the Conservatives, Labour and the Green party . Mr Blair's intervention came after the Lib Dem leader was humiliated by Nigel Farage, who publicly credited him with Ukip’s unprecedented victory in this weekend's European elections. Lib Dem MPs and activists broke cover to insist that Mr Clegg should resign, saying it would be ‘insanity’ to carry on without a change of leadership after such an ‘abysmal’ result. Leaked polling published by the Guardian suggested the Lib Dem wipeout could be repeated at next year’s General Election, with Mr Clegg even set to lose his own seat. The concerns over Mr Clegg’s future are now so serious that senior Tories are discussing what it would mean for the future of the Coalition if Mr Clegg was forced to stand down. On a dramatic political day: . In a catastrophic night, the Lib Dems lost all their seats in every region apart from the South-East as Ukip romped to victory with 24 MEPs and a 28 per cent share of the vote. Labour ended the night with 20 MEPs, the Tories 19 and the Green Party three. How the nation voted . It led to calls yesterday for Mr Clegg to stand down, with Business Secretary Vince Cable tipped as his possible replacement. After several hours of silence yesterday, Mr Cable was forced to publicly deny there was an ‘issue’ over leadership. But at a rally in London, Mr Farage . said: ‘I would be very surprised if he [Mr Clegg] led the Lib Dems into . the next General Election.’ He thanked Mr Clegg for challenging him to two TV debates, which the Lib Dem leader was widely judged to have lost badly. Mr Farage said: ‘Nick Clegg, to whom I am personally extremely grateful, because challenging us to those debates really kicked off the whole European election campaign.’ But the former Prime Minister Tony Blair said Mr Clegg had done the right thing in standing up to Mr Farage. He said: 'To be fair to Nick Clegg, I don’t want to damage him by saying this, but over the last few years he’s shown quite a lot of leadership and courage as a leader. 'But the problem the Lib Dems have is nothing to do with Europe. The problem they have is very simple. They fought the 2010 election on a platform significantly to the left of Labour and then ended up in a Conservative government with a platform significantly to the right of Labour. 'If you're someone who voted Lib Dem in 2010 because you liked their total opposition to tuition fees, you're going to be somewhat disappointed, let's say, when the people you vote for end up in a government that triples them. That's the problem the Lib Dems have and there's not much cure for that.' Former Tory Chancellor Ken Clarke said the Liberal Democrats were in a 'big electoral dilemma' because they were no longer the protest party. He said: 'I prefer the politics to the psephology. But actually, if you think about the Liberals, firstly they've lost the protest vote - which is a big part of their vote. If you want to protest, you vote UKIP now because [the Liberal Democrats] have joined the Government. 'They lost about 50% of their former supporters who were otherwise on the left, Labour supporters who voted Liberal to try to keep the Conservatives out. 'So the Liberals are on a big electoral dilemma; pro-Europeans probably voted Liberal Democrat at this election but most pro-Europeans didn't vote.' Celebration: A jubilant Mr Farage sank pints at the Westminster Arms - and credited Mr Clegg with his victory . Nick Clegg felt the true force of public disenchantment with his party in his own back yard. In Sheffield, where he stands as an MP, the Liberal Democrats were pushed into fifth place. In nearby Doncaster, it was a similar situation for Ed Miliband. He sits as one of the town’s MPs, but Labour only came second there, behind Ukip. The Tories face a tough by-election in Newark next week and will be hoping to improve on their standing in the European vote. Ukip beat them by 10,027 votes to 9,641. But David Cameron fought off the Ukip challenge in West Oxfordshire – which contains his Witney seat. The Tories held Ukip off into second place. The opinion polls which were leaked were commissioned by a Lib Dem activist and suggest that Mr Clegg will lose in Sheffield Hallam to Labour by 33 points to 23, finishing even behind the Tories. In the 2010 election, Mr Clegg won over 50 per cent of the vote. The polling also suggested the Lib Dems will lose Cambridge, Redcar and Wells. But a Liberal Democrat spokesman dismissed the poll's findings. He said: 'We have no idea where this polling comes from but it has clearly been commissioned and leaked for political purposes. 'It bears no relation to the result we saw on Thursday night, where Liberal Democrats secured 38.7% of the vote across Sheffield Hallam. Labour managed 23.6%, whilst the Tories came fifth with just 10.7%.' Mr Clegg, appearing at Lib Dem HQ in London, appealed for his party to hold its nerve until next year’s General Election, insisting ousting him as leader would be even more catastrophic for the party’s prospects. Looking exhausted, he said: ‘If I thought any of our real dilemmas would be addressed by changing leadership, changing strategy, changing approaches, bailing out now, changing direction, then I wouldn’t hesitate advocating it. Absolutely not.’ Isolated: Mr Clegg after voting in the European elections. Leaked polls suggest he would lose his seat . But 12 Lib Dem MPs were said to be ready to publicly call for Mr Clegg’s head, though some of those on the list denied involvement in a plot. Lib Dem MP John Pugh said he wanted Mr Cable to take over as leader, blaming his party’s ‘abysmal’ showing on voters’ attitude to Mr Clegg. ‘If we carry on as usual we are like the generals at the Somme, because the losses are so horrendous. Given the scale of the losses, to call for business as usual is frankly ludicrous,’ he said. Former Liberal president Des Wilson said Mr Clegg was ‘politically toxic’ and ‘no longer credible’ and should step down as party leader, while remaining Deputy Prime Minister. Business Secretary Mr Cable, who is currently in China, said the results were ‘exceptionally disappointing’. But he added: ‘Nick did a bold thing in standing up to the eurosceptic wave which has engulfed much of continental Europe. We are the only party to have taken that on and he personally deserves tremendous credit for that. ‘There is no leadership issue... Now is not the time for infighting and introspection. The party must hold its nerve.’ There is a small band of ‘Tories for Vince’ in the Cabinet, who believe a change of leader would restore Lib Dem fortunes – which in turn could stop Labour picking up enough disaffected Lib Dem votes to win power. Senior Tories are understood to believe Mr Clegg is likely to survive the leadership crisis but have discussed for the first time what would happen if he is pushed out. They expect the Lib Dems would move to a so-called ‘confidence and supply’ arrangement, under which a minority party in a coalition pledges Parliamentary support to the Government in any motion of confidence, or any Bills relating to finance and spending. It would not prevent the minority party opposing the Government on other areas of policy.","Deputy PM had bloodshot eyes as he admitted fifth place was 'gutting'

"By . Bianca London . She may be 76 and have clocked up over 80 million book sales but Judy Blume isn't putting the pen to rest yet. The famed American author, whose novels including Blubber and Forever were among the first to tackle racism, sex, divorce and bullying, is releasing her first book in over ten years. Blume, whose last book for adults, Summer Sisters, was published in 1998, will be releasing the new tome in the summer of 2015. She's back! Judy Blume is set to release her first book in over 10 years. The yet-to-be-named novel will be her first since Summer Sisters in 1998 . The book, which will be for adults, is yet to be titled and next to no details have been divulged. Speaking to The New York Times, Blume's publisher, Carole Baron at Alfred A. Knopf, said: ‘It’s pure Judy Blume, writing about family and about friendships, about love, about betrayal. It’s quintessential Judy. Not putting that pen down yet: Blume, who has won more than 90 literary awards, will be basing her new book around family, friendships, love and betrayal, say her publishers . Blume, who has been working on the novel for four years, said: 'I’m both thrilled and terrified, my usual feelings at this point.' Blume, who has won more than 90 literary awards, first began writing when her children were attending preschool and her first novel, The One in the Middle Is the Green Kangaroo, was published in 1969.

Pogrebnyak, 30, who has yet to appear for his country under Capello, had been a surprise inclusion on Monday. 'I am a bit shocked and didn't believe that I had been excluded from the squad,' Pogrebnyak, whose last appearance for Russia came against Greece in June 2012, said in an interview with Sovetsky Sport. Not heading for Brazil: Pavel Pogrebnyak (left) has been cut from Russia's World Cup squad . 'I hoped that I would be part of the squad, I kept myself fit and was grateful for the faith that was showed in me. 'However in just a couple of days they took away that hope from me.' The former Fulham forward scored 13 goals in 39 Championship appearances for Reading in England's second tier this season. 'Of course it is upsetting,' he added. 'The World Cup is a dream for any footballer. There are more important things in life, but I really wanted to play there. The head coach has the right to pick the squad he wishes.' Thanks for coming! Boss Fabio Capello had tough decisions to make in order to trim his squad down to 23 . Artem Dzyuba, the second leading scorer in the Russian Premier League this season with 17 goals for Rostov, was put on a reserve list along with defenders Alexander Anyukov and Alexey Berezutskiy and midfielders Vladimir Bystrov and Yury Gazinskiy.

"By . Leon Watson . A schoolteacher who blackmailed terrified teenage girls into sending him explicit pictures of themselves was jailed for six years today. Zahid Akram, a married father of two young daughters, targeted the victims aged between 13 and 18 after befriending them on social networking sites. He pretended to be a young man and persuaded them to send him photos of themselves in their underwear - but then said he knew who their parents were and were they lived and threatened to rape two of them as he demanded more sexualised pictures of themselves. At Exeter Crown Court, Judge Francis Gilbert QC said as he sentenced the 37-year-old physics teacher that blackmail was 'an evil crime, one of the ugliest on the criminal calendar'. Science teacher Zahid Akram, 37, of Redditch, in Worcestershire, trawled the internet looking for victims across the UK before he blackmailed them into sending him explicit pictures of themselves . The judge said his first victim was a 16-year-old schoolgirl who passed on her e-mail and phone details to Akram who posed as a younger man. He then sexualised the conversation and persuaded her to send him some pictures of her in bra and knickers. But within three days Akram, from Redditch, Worcestershire, . but then living in Exeter, Devon, texted her saying he wanted 'kinky . stuff on a webcam' or he would send the earlier pictures to her parents . whose full names he knew after researching the details on Facebook and . the internet. He also . threatened to put the pictures on a pornographic site and also send them . to her school - even though she had not given him any of those details. Akram . called himself Beelzebub, The Devil, and used another false name and . threatened to send her parents and school a profile he would put on a . porn site. The girl was 'extremely worried' and he taunted her for three months. The . second victim was just 13 at the time and lives in Northern Ireland. He . did the same thing to her and threatened to show her pictures of her in . her underwear to people in her town. Exeter Crown Court heard Akram promised four girls, aged between 13 and 18, they could 'trust' him and persuaded them to send images of themselves in their underwear . He . then forced her to take pornographic pictures of herself sitting naked . with her legs apart and saying he would meet her. He also demanded a £40 top . up for his phone. The third . victim was 18 and from the south of England and called himself Jason. He also blackmailed her to send more explicit photos of herself or he . would come to a hotel near her home and rape her and she believed his . threat to be real. The . fourth victim was a 17-year-old from the North of England and he called . himself Rick and blackmailed her to send sexualised pictures of herself. The . judge said Akram 'targeted young girls' who were susceptible and . vulnerable and 'threatened them in a . truly vile way'. Two girls were left fearing they would be raped and were 'absolutely terrified'. Prosecutor . David Sapiecha told the court: 'There were multiple victims in the UK. It had a profound effect on them. They were left crying, feeling sick, . and upset what had gone on and embarrassed. Judge Gilbert at Exeter Crown Court (pictured) ordered Akram to sign to the Sex Offenders¿ Register and imposed a Sexual Offences Prevention Order for at least 10 years . 'There . were four victims and he had a particularly callous attitude to them to . feed his sexual desires and to gain a small amount of money. 'The underlying motive is sexual. He hunted them down.' Mr . Sapiecha said the victims did not know each other and lived around the . UK and he said Akram 'trawled the internet and sought them out' using . social networking sites including Badoo.com. He . said the first victim thought she was in contact with a young man . called Kurt Renshaw and they shared ordinary pictures - including one of . a young man who clearly wasn't Akram. He . then went on to ask for pictures of her in her bra and knickers and . shared them with him on a private noticeboard on the over 18 site which . is used by children. Mr . Sapiecha said Akram then aggressively blackmailed her in a 'chilling . way' and threatened to post her underwear pictures on a porn site if she . did do what he said and demanded 'kinky stuff'. He . also demanded she laid out her underwear on her bed so he could choose . what she wore and only gave her minutes to agree to it or 'things will . get really nasty'. Akram said if she didn't then he would post her profile on a porn website 'asking for men to come and rape her'. He . also demanded a £10 phone top up from her and she was left frightened, . embarrassed and worried, said the Crown, who said there were 184 calls . between them in three or four days in 2011. 'She . felt sick because he knew what she looked like,' said Mr Sapiecha who . said Akram had researched her on Facebook and found out her parents' full names and 'used that as a lever'. He . said Akram was 'callous and scaring them into what he wanted' and then . moved on to pester the 13-year-old girl who sent him 20 photos of . herself. Akram, . who taught physics at a Dorset school but did not target any girls from . his own school, also forced the youngest victim to send him photos of . her topless and bottomless and isolated her from her friends and from . going out. He called her names and left her short of money to buy her own mother a Christmas gift after giving him £40 for a phone top-up. He . told her about another girl who did not do what she told and when the . 13-year-old asked if she was okay and still alive, Akram said she was . 'in a lot of pain'. She then posed completely naked. When . he was arrested, Akram told police he used false names because he did . not want his wife to know that he was 'flirting with people'. He gave an . innocent explanation at first and then said nothing to police. Defence . barrister Lawrence Wilcox said Akram was a 'highly strung, intense' man . who was passive but became attracted by the prospect of 'control and . escapism'. He said his . marriage was in trouble and he had long standing debts of £40,000 and . had been a teacher at a school for ten years where there had been no . suggestion of impropriety. Akram admitted four charges of blackmail and one of causing or inciting a child to prostitution or pornography. Dr . Richard Steward, head teacher of Akram's former Woodroffe school in . Lyme Regis, Dorset, said he was immediately suspended when the police . probe began. He later quit. He said 'none of the offences have any connection with the school or local community'. Police . investigator Det Con Steve Harris said: 'I think there are hundreds of . victims he has contacted. They are aged between 13 and 30 and they live . all other the UK. He had at least 12 profiles, mostly young males but . one was as a woman.' He said . he got them to take pictures of themselves and increased the level of . sexualisation. His demands were about empowerment rather than sexual . gratification. He had very little control over his life at work or at . home. He needed some way of taking control and this is what he ended up . doing.' Akram, who had no . previous convictions, was traced and his computer seized after one of . his victims bravely contacted police and his degraded secret life which . went on from October 2009 until 2012 was exposed. He . was placed on the Sex Offenders' register and given ban from working . with children. He will be released after serving half the six year term.","Zahid Akram, 37, from Redditch, trawled the internet looking for victims .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . If you want to unlock the mystery of how humans migrated from Africa, then the unsightly cold sore could provide the answer. The different genome variations in the cold sore virus have been hitchhiking their way around the world for tens of thousands of years. Tracking these variations is part a project by the University of Wisconsin at Madison who has been analysing 31 samples of herpes simplex virus type-1. When the researchers compared the strains . of HSV-1 collected in North America, Europe, Africa and Asia, they were . 'stunned' by the results. The map shows how the cold sore virus originated in Africa and gradually spread outwards, evolving along the way. Different variants (labelled as 'I', 'II', 'III', 'V' etc) in the herpes virus have been hitchhiking their way around the world for tens of thousands of years and mirror the theory of how man populated the world . The Out of Africa theory is the most widely accepted model describing the geographic origin and early migration of modern humans. Studies of human genomes have shown that . our ancestors emerged from Africa roughly 150,000 to 200,000 years ago, . and then spread eastward toward Asia, and westward toward Europe. These settlers replaced other early humans (such as Neanderthals), rather than interbreeding with them. Their analysis showed the most genetic diversity was found in African strains of the virus, suggesting it had the oldest roots. The results give weight to the proposed by the ‘Out of Africa’ theory of human migration. ‘The viral strains sort exactly as you would predict based on sequencing of human genomes,’ said senior author Curtis Brandt, a professor of medical microbiology and ophthalmology. ‘We found that all of the African isolates cluster together, all the virus from the Far East, Korea, Japan, China clustered together, all the viruses in Europe and America, with one exception, clustered together.’ The researchers compared the strains of the herpes simplex virus (pictured) which were collected in North America, Europe, Africa and Asia . Geneticists explore how organisms are related by studying changes in the sequence of bases, or ‘letters’ on their genes. From knowledge of how quickly a particular genome changes, they can construct a ‘family tree’ that shows when particular variants had their last common ancestor. Studies of human genomes have shown that our ancestors emerged from Africa roughly 150,000 to 200,000 years ago, and then spread eastward toward Asia, and westward toward Europe. The findings reflect the view that a small human population passed through a ‘bottleneck’ to get from Africa to the Middle East. From there, they went their separate ways to Europe and Asia, and eventually to the Americas. Nearly all of the samples from the U.S. were linked to European strains, but one sample from Texas was linked to Asia. Brandt claims that the sample may have come from someone who picked up the virus during a trip to the Far East. Studies of human genomes have shown that our ancestors emerged from Africa roughly 150,000 to 200,000 years ago . Another theory is that the person picked it up from someone with Native American heritage whose ancestors passed over a ‘land bridge’ between Asia and North America. ‘We found support for the land bridge hypothesis, because the date of divergence from its most recent Asian ancestor was about 15,000 years ago,’ Professor Brandt said. ‘The dates match, so we postulate that this was an Amerindian virus.’ The researchers said HSV-1 strains are ideal for tracking long-term migration patterns because they're easy to collect and capable of forming lifelong latent infections. Because the viral genome is so much simpler than the human genome, it's cheaper to sequence. ‘While preliminary, our data raise the possibility that HSV-1 sequences could serve as a surrogate marker to analyse human migration and population structures,’ the researchers said. The technology of simultaneously comparing the entire genomes of related viruses could also be useful in exploring why certain strains of a virus are so much more lethal than others. In a tiny percentage of cases, for example, HSV-1 can cause a deadly brain infection, Brandt notes. ‘We'd like to understand why these few viruses are so dangerous, when the predominant course of herpes is so mild. ‘We believe that a difference in the gene sequence is determining the outcome, and we are interested in sorting this out,’ he said.","Most genetic diversity found in African strains of the cold sore virus .
Pattern matches movement of human genome that gradually spread outwards from the continent to Asia and Europe .
Researchers hope the technique could also help explore why certain strains of a virus are so much more lethal than others ."
"By . Jill Reilly . Objects that crashed to the ground in China have been identified as space debris, state media reported, after a Russian rocket carrying a communications satellite fell back to Earth minutes after lift-off. Qiqihar city in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, which borders Russia’s far east, reported that several objects appeared to have fallen from the sky on Friday, the Xinhua news agency said. One of the parts is a metal dome with jagged, blackened edges. Space debris from a Russian rocket that exploded in the earth's atmosphere have fallen in China, according to state media .

After analysis, experts have concluded they were 'parts from a carrier rocket or a satellite', Xinhua said Sunday, citing the China National Space Administration . It . was the second failure for the Proton-M in less than a year, and the . second time that it had failed to deliver such a European satellite, . after the last one crashed shortly after launch in 2011. Friday's . unmanned mission went awry when the engine on the third stage of the . Proton-M booster rocket failed, Oleg Ostapenko, head of the Russian . space agency Roskosmos, told Russian news agencies. He said the precise . cause was unknown. The unmanned mission went awry when the engine on the third stage of the Proton-M booster rocket failed 100 miles up . The . failure occurred at an altitude of 160 km (100 miles), about nine . minutes after the early-morning lift-off from the Russian-leased . Baikonur facility in Kazakhstan. The . state-run RIA quoted Ostapenko as saying that the rocket and all debris . had burned up in the atmosphere: 'We can say with certainty that . nothing reached Earth.' However, . Russian media said some debris may have fallen into the Pacific or been . scattered over Siberia and Russia's Far East. No casualties or damage . were reported on the ground. The . lost Express AM4R satellite, worth more than 200 million euros ($275 . million), was described by its maker Astrium, a unit of the European . aerospace group Airbus, as one of the most powerful satellites built in . Europe. Its loss delays a number of commercial projects by three to four years. 'It's . a heavy blow, of course. And the thing is that our workhorse rocket - . our most powerful and the most-used rocket - has such a bad record,' Ivan Moiseyev, head of the Russian-based Institute of Space Policy think . tank, told Kommersant-FM radio. He said the rocket had a 7 . percent failure rate, and its unreliability was making it harder for . Russia to compete in the multibillion-dollar global satellite launch . industry, giving a boost to its European rival Arianespace and the . American newcomer SpaceX. Trouble in the sky: A Proton M rocket carrying the Canadian Anik F3 telecommunication satellite blasts off at Baikonur Cosmodromein 2007. But it has suffered a series of mishaps since . 'It's . a very unsuccessful picture on the whole and, if you compare it with . our main competitors, with Europe, their last accident was 12 years . ago,' Moiseyev said. Last . July, three navigation satellites worth about $200 million were lost . when the Proton-M rocket crashed near the launch pad shortly after . take-off.

"By . Rebecca Evans . Defiantly striding through the park with his fitness guru, Andrew Marr is seen without a walking stick for the first time since his stroke. Nine months after suffering the debilitating illness, which doctors warned he would be lucky to survive, the broadcaster seems well on the road to recovery. On Sunday, clutching his walking stick, he returned to his political show on BBC1 – to the delight of guests and viewers. Fighting fit: Andrew Marr was seen in West London working with trainer Tom Balchin . Just a few days later he was in Richmond Park, West London, being put through his paces by trainer Tom Balchin, a stroke survivor and the founder of Action for Rehabilitation from Neurological Injuries. During the one-hour exercise session, Marr was seen using benches to perform press-ups, taking a power walk through the park and using Dr Balchin’s arms for resistance to help improve his upper body strength. Keep-fit addict Marr, 53, was left with seriously impaired mobility down his left side after tearing an artery in his neck while working out on a rowing machine in his garden shed in East Sheen, West London in January. He suffered bleeding on the brain after symptoms of a ‘blinding headache and flashes of light’ but did not call for an ambulance until the next day. Remarkable recovery: Just days after his return to his television show, Andrew Marr was walking without the aid of a stick . Back on track: Andrew Marr used a cane when he returned to his self-titled show for the first time since his stroke on Sunday . He spent two months in hospital. At one . stage his wife Jackie was warned that if he lived he would be left . unable to talk, walk, eat, drink or hear. Since then, Marr’s recovery . has been nothing short of extraordinary. He has described Dr Balchin as ‘a wise bully’ and ‘an amazing independent trainer’ who has helped him to get better. Dr Balchin said Marr’s successes were clear, adding: ‘He has done exceedingly well and has learned all kinds of gross motor-movement techniques, including getting down and up from the floor in under ten seconds without the help of a chair or support. ‘This is an astonishing achievement. He has worked incredibly hard on this and on his upper-limb training, which is very hard work. His grit and perseverance are unusual and his recovery will certainly be excellent if he keeps going at this rate. ‘He has been encouraged from the very start with me to try and match what he does with his right-hand [less affected] upper limb with his left [more affected] limb.’ The broadcaster is back presenting the Andrew Marr Show each Sunday and plans to return to Radio 4’s Start The Week soon.","Andrew Marr was working out in West London unaided .

"By . Mark Prigg . Scroll down for video . The US military is developing special gloves that would let soldiers scale vertical walls. Based on a gecko's feet, the gloves are coated with a specialized cloth called 'Geckskin'. Impregnated with a reversible adhesive elastomer, they cling to surfaces the same way that the gecko's feet do. Dubbed the Z-Man project, the new, specialized climbing paddles were developed for Darpa by Cambridge Massachusetts' Draper Laboratory. Recently, DARPA demonstrated the latest iteration by having a 218-pound researcher  with 50 pounds of recording gear scale a 25-foot tall glass wall. Geckos can climb on a wide variety of surfaces, including smooth surfaces like glass, with adhesive pressures of 15-30 pounds per square inch for each limb, meaning that a gecko can hang its entire body by one toe. The anatomy of a gecko toe consists of a microscopic hierarchical structure composed of stalk-like setae (100 microns in length, 2 microns in radius). From individual setae, a bundle of hundreds of terminal tips called spatulae (approximately 200 nanometers in diameter at their widest) branch out and contact the climbing surface. Dubbed the Z-Man project, the new, specialized climbing paddles were developed for Darpa by Cambridge Massachusetts' Draper Laboratory. 'The gecko is one of the champion climbers in the Animal Kingdom, so it was natural for Darpa to look to it for inspiration in overcoming some of the maneuver challenges that U.S. forces face in urban environments,' said Dr. Matt Goodman, the Darpa program manager for Z-Man. 'Like many of the capabilities that the Department of Defense pursues, we saw with vertical climbing that nature had long since evolved the means to efficiently achieve it. 'The challenge to our performer team was to understand the biology and physics in play when geckos climb and then reverse-engineer those dynamics into an artificial system for use by humans.' Recently, Darpa demonstrated the latest iteration of its Geckskin by having a 218-pound researcher (saddled with 50 pounds of recording gear) scale a 25-foot tall glass wall. 'The Z-Man programs aims to develop biologically inspired climbing aids to enable warfighters to scale vertical walls constructed from typical building materials, while carrying a full combat load, and without the use of ropes or ladders. Geckos can climb on a wide variety of surfaces, including smooth surfaces like glass, with adhesive pressures of 15-30 pounds per square inch for each limb, meaning that a gecko can hang its entire body by one toe thanks to a microscopic hierarchical structure composed of stalk-like setae (100 microns in length, 2 microns in radius). Now researchers hope to create a paddle to allow human s to climb . a 16-square-inch sheet of Geckskin adhering to a vertical glass wall while supporting a static load of 660 pounds. A gecko is able to climb on glass by using physical bond interactions—specifically van der Waals intermolecular forces—between the spatulae and a surface to adhere reversibly, resulting in easy attachment and removal of the gecko’s toes from the surface. The van der Waals mechanism implied that it is the size and shape of the spatulae tips that affect adhesive performance, not specific surface chemistry. This suggested that there were design principles and physical models derived from nature that might enable scientists to fabricate an adhesive inspired by gecko toes. 'Geckskin' is one output of the Z-Man program. It is a synthetically-fabricated reversible adhesive inspired by the gecko’s ability to climb surfaces of various materials and roughness, including smooth surfaces like glass. Performers on Z-Man designed adhesive pads to mimic the gecko foot over multiple length scales, from the macroscopic foot tendons to the microscopic setae and spatulae, to maximize reversible van der Waals interactions with the surface. Darpa says the project could give it the upper hand in battle. 'Historically, gaining the high ground has always been an operational advantage for warfighters, but the climbing instruments on which they’re frequently forced to rely—tools such as ropes and ladders—have not advanced significantly for millennia. 'Darpa created the Z-Man program to overcome these limitations and deliver maximum safety and flexibility for maneuver and rapid response to warfighters operating in tight urban environments. 'The goal of the program is to develop biologically inspired climbing aids to enable warfighters carrying a full combat load to scale vertical walls constructed from typical building materials.'","Dubbed the Z-Man project specialized climbing 'gloves' allow soldiers to climb walls .

"By . Australian Associated Press . The Great Barrier Reef is in the worst state it's been in since records began and it will be 'pretty ugly' within 40 years, Australian scientists say. Experts claim the world's largest reef is facing threats from coastal development, such as a massive port-related dredging project at Abbot Point, the most northerly deepwater coal port of Australia, situated 25 kilometres north of Bowen, Queensland. Farm run-off and poor water quality are also endangering the reef, scientists say. In danger: By 2050, there will reportedly be fewer fish and large swathes of seaweed in the Great Barrier Reef where complex coral structures once thrived . A Senate committee is investigating how the Australian and Queensland governments have managed the reef, ahead of a UNESCO decision next year about whether to list it as a World Heritage site in danger. The Australian Coral Reef Society - the oldest organisation in the world that studies reefs - says coral cover has halved since the 1980s when the reef was listed as a World Heritage site. By 2050, there will be fewer fish and large swathes of seaweed where complex coral structures once thrived, society president Professor Peter Mumby said. 'It will be really pretty ugly,' Professor Mumby told the committee. 'The reef is in the worse state it's ever been in since records began. There is so much scope to improve governance.' Queensland government representatives told the committee progress was being made towards ticking off recommendations made by the World Heritage Committee, including establishing a long-term management plan for the ecosystem. Scientists have told a Senate committee the reef is facing threats from coastal development . '[This] is intended to bring all of the pieces of reef management together into easily digestible forms,' Department of Environment deputy secretary Dr Kimberley Dripps said. 'This is so the community can see what is being done across all of the different programs, policies and investments.' Programs had led to improvements in water quality, Dr Dripps said, citing the federal government's $40 million reef trust established to help improve the health of the reef. Three million cubic metres of sand and soil will be dredged for the Abbot Point port expansion. It will be dumped offshore, inside the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Area but about 40km from the nearest reef. Decimated: The Australian Coral Reef Society says coral cover has halved since the 1980s when the reef was listed as a World Heritage site . Ports Australia chief executive David Anderson said offshore dumping was cheaper and better for the environment than onshore dumping. He told the hearing the effects were misunderstood and overstated. 'The process, in many respects, is placed in information that is not totally correct,' he said. Felicity Wishart from the Australian Marine Conservation Society led a small protest outside parliament before giving evidence at the hearing. She wants state and federal governments to ban the dumping of dredge spoil offshore and dramatically curb its use. 'We're very unhappy at the moment,' she told AAP. 'We've seen approval of massive port expansions, we've sen dredging and dumping in the reef's waters. 'We don't think that is the best way to be treating a world heritage icon.' The committee will also hold public hearings in Mackay and Townsville this week.

"By . Mark Prigg . It could mean the end of the washing machine - and a lot less hassle. A Colombian student has revealed his concept for a 'washing ball'. It can be placed directly into a laundry basket, and clean clothes without ever having to remove them. The Luna concept is a metallic sphere with a small amount of water. It creates a cloud of fine particles of steam electrostatically charged, which comes out through pores of the metal surface,  vibrations and pulses then scrub and shake farbic, removing dirt. The Luna concept is a metallic sphere with a small amount of water in it. It creates a cloud of fine particles of steam electrostatically charged, which comes out through pores of the metal surface. It then rotates and moves between clothes through vibrations and pulses designed to scrub and shake tissues, loosening dirt. The metallic surface of the sphere acts as a magnet: electrostatically charged, it attracts dirt particles impregnated with steam and sucks these towards the core of the sphere. Finally, Luna dries with hot air the residual damp in the tissues. The idea has already been selected as a finalist in the prestigious Electrolux Design Lab contest. Luna is an electrostatic spherical washing machine. 'The idea is not to put the clothes into a washing machine, but rather, the washing machine between the dirty clothes,' says Juan Camilo Restrepo Villamizar of Colombia Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, who developed the design. He claims consumers will be won over by its ease of use, but also the environmental advantages. 'Users are increasingly aware of the care of the planet. 'Luna renews the fabric care experience, in a simple, elegant and sustainable way, he said. 'The sphere reduces the consumption of water and energy, optimizes time and reduces the effort required in washing and fabric care. 'These are the reasons why Luna will be part of the lives of the users of the future and of the transformation of the homes, in healthy homes.' The luna design turns the laundry basket into a washing machine - all owners have to do is drop the metallic ball in to get their clothes cleaned . The competition is conducted in stages, allowing the applicants to develop their concept throughout the process. After the voting ends May 16, the decision for the Top 70+ will be announced May 19. Ten of the ideas receiving the most votes will have direct access to the next stage and the rest are chosen by the team of Electrolux experts. Once the finalists have been selected, the student whose concept receives the most public votes will be named the winner of the People’s Choice Award and will receive a prize of 1,000 Euros. First prize will be awarded to a student that the judging panel considers has created a ground-breaking design solution for the future. This student will receive 5,000 Euros and a six-month paid internship at an Electrolux global design center. Second prize is 3,000 Euros and third prize is 2,000 Euros.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Stroh's was an American beer powerhouse but then the family squandered what would have been a $9 billion fortune in just a few short years. Bernhard Stroh started the brewing business when he arrived in Detroit from Germany in 1850 with $150 and a treasured family recipe for beer. He began selling the beer door to door out of a wheelbarrow and soon Stroh's Beer was being shipped first around the Great Lakes where they had a loyal following and then around the country. In 1980, Stroh's became the third largest brewing business in the United States when Bernhard's great great grandson Peter Stroh became CEO and purchased F&M Schaefer and Joseph Schlitz Brewing. Beer: Bernhard Stroh, pictured left, started the brewing business when he arrived in Detroit from Germany in 1850 with $150 and a treasured family recipe for beer . Brew: Bernhard began selling the beer door to door out of a wheelbarrow and soon Stroh's Beer was being shipped first around the Great Lakes where they had a loyal following and then around the country. It was first made in this Detroit brewery . The family's new fortune saw them make the Forbes list of the richest families in the country, worth $700 million in 1988. And Forbes today believes that the family would currently be worth about $9 billion. But the something went wrong. Family members confessed to Forbes that acquiring Schlitz, a beer company with six plants to Stroh's one, overwhelmed the business and they didn't have the marketing prowess to keep so many different brands up with rivals Anheuser Busch and Miller. According to Forbes, Peter Stroh continued his disastrous acquisition spree among other moves but still the company failed. By the end of the 1980s, Colorado's Coors overtook Stroh's as the country's third largest brewer and in August 1989 Stroh's laid off 300 employees. Factory: This July 1990 picture shows the Stroh Brewery in southeast Memphis . Too big: Peter Stroh made a number of disastrous acquisitions in the 1980s . The following month, Peter Stroh agreed to sell the family business to Coors for $425 but Coors pulled out of the deal. Desperate, the company brought in a renowned ad man to reinvigorate the brand. he changed the label, hiked prices and stopped the previous 15 bottles for 12 deal, all of which were disastrous decisions that resulted in 'the biggest drop in sales in the history of beer,' former director of market research Ed Benfield told Forbes. Sales plunged 40 per cent in a year. In 1996, Peter Stroh decided to purchase another brewery with $300 million in borrowed funds, but that business, like Stroh's, was on the decline. He then took a gamble on biotechnology and on Detroit real estate, exacerbating the problems. New businesses: Descendent Greg Stroh, pictured, went on to co-found three beverage brands including Izze Soda . By 1999, the company was worried it wouldn't even be able to make the interest payments on its debt, so it sold itself for scraps, brand by brand. Miller Brewing bought some, while Pabst bought the rest at around $350 million.  Some $250 million went into debt service and employee pension fund liabilities while the remaining $100 million went into a fund for the family, but ran out in 2008. After the company's dissolution in 2000, some Stroh brands were discontinued. The Pabst Brewing Company acquired the most brands, and it currently produces Colt 45 malt liquor, Lone Star, Schaefer, Schlitz, Schmidt's, Old Milwaukee, Old Style, Stroh's, and St. Ides. The Miller Brewing Company got Mickey's Malt Liquor and Henry Weinhard's. Most other Stroh brands disappeared after 2000. In the 1980s the seven members of the fourth generation got $400,000 a year, according to Forbes. 'A lot of people were living off the family business,' 47-year-old descendant Greg Stroh told the website. Though he wasn't one of them, and he co-founded three companies, including Izze Soda. Others ran into trouble with drugs and alcohol.","Bernhard Stroh started Stroh's brewing business when he arrived in Detroit from Germany in 1850 with $150 and a treasured family recipe for beer .

"By . Associated Press . The rate of HIV infections diagnosed in the United States each year fell by one-third over the past decade - hopeful news that the AIDS epidemic may be slowing in America. Sixteen out of every 100,000 people ages 13 . and older were newly diagnosed with HIV in 2011, a steady decline from . 24 out of 100,000 people in 2002, a study released online Saturday by the Journal of the American Medical Association found. The reasons for the drop aren't clear. It might mean fewer new infections are occurring or that most infected people already have been diagnosed so more testing won't necessarily find many more cases. 'It could be we are approaching something of a ""ceiling effect,""' said one study leader, David Holtgrave of Johns Hopkins University. Decline: The rate of HIV infections diagnosed in the United States each year fell by one-third over the past decade - hopeful news that the AIDS epidemic may be slowing in America . The research is part of the journal's special report on HIV research, issued ahead of the International AIDS Conference that starts Sunday in Melbourne, Australia. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS, which destroys the immune system. The World Health Organization estimates 35 million people globally have the virus. In the United States, 1.1 million people are thought to be infected, though many don't know it. The study is based on HIV diagnoses from all 50 states' health departments, which get test results from doctors' office, clinics, hospitals and laboratories. The data span a decade, making this a larger and longer look at these trends than any previous study, said another study author, Amy Lansky of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Declines were seen in the rates for men, women, whites, blacks, Hispanics, heterosexuals, injection drug users and most age groups. The only group in which diagnoses increased was young gay and bisexual men, the study found. The diagnosis rate is a direct measure of when people actually tested positive for the virus. The diagnoses may be identifying infections that happened recently or years before. HIV: Former US president Bill Clinton visited an orphanage with HIV-infected kids in the outskirts of Hanoi on July 18, 2014. Rates of infection of HIV in the U.S. have dropped int he past decade . The study found diagnosis rates dropped even as the amount of testing rose. In 2006, the CDC recommended routine HIV testing for all Americans ages 13 to 64, saying an HIV test should be as common as a cholesterol check. The percentage of adults ever tested for HIV increased from 37 percent in 2000 to 45 percent in 2010, according to CDC data. Lansky acknowledged that given the testing increases, the new findings may seem like a bit of a paradox. One might assume that 'if more people get tested, you're more likely to find more people who are infected,' she said. But several factors could explain the decline. One is Holgrave's 'ceiling effect' theory. Another is a possible ebb in new infections. The CDC has been estimating about 50,000 new infections occur each year and that number has been holding steady in the past decade. That estimate comes from reports from 25 city and state health departments, joined with statistical modeling. Lansky said maybe new infections are waning. Or maybe not, she and other experts said. How could new infections be holding steady when diagnoses are falling? Perhaps the infection count might be buoyed by the expanding epidemic in young gay and bisexual men, said Sullivan, the Emory researcher.","16 out of every 100,000 people ages 13 and older were newly diagnosed with HIV in 2011, a steady decline from 24 out of 100,000 people in 2002 .

In 2009, then-speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi released a video on Congress' YouTube hub, which was in its infancy at the time, titled 'Speaker Pelosi Presents Capitol Cat Cam,' which was billed as 'a behind the scenes view of the Speaker's Office in the U.S. Capitol.' The video showed several cats roaming around Pelosi's office. About halfway through the video, viewers get Rickroll'd with Astley's video.

"An 11-year-old girl killed by a stray bullet is among the four dead and dozens of other people wounded by yet another brutal weekend of gun violence in Chicago. Shamiya Adams was making s'mores inside a South Side home for a sleepover Friday night when a bullet went into the house and struck her in the head. Three other people were shot dead and a further 40 were injured, police said. As usual, the bulk of the violence occurred on the South and West Sides – a refrain that is now playing out in the Windy City on an almost nightly basis. Senseless: Shamiya Adams, 11, was killed by a stray bullet in front of her friends while making s'mores during a sleepover inside the home of her best friend . Adams death shocked a city so used to witnessing dozens of shootings across entire weekends that a website named HeyJacka** is used to track, among other things, how many people are shot in the buttocks each year. She was murdered despite being seemingly safe and sound inside a West Side home. ‘They were just running around through the house, dancing. That's all they do is dance all the time. And dancing, dancing, dancing,’ homeowner Rosemarie Jones told WLS. She was rushed to a hospital and died Saturday morning. ‘The familiarity of laughter has been replaced by the familiarity of gunfire,’ Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in a Saturday morning press briefing. The innocent girl was making s'mores with her friends when the bullet struck her, according to the Chicago Tribune. Her young friends saw the bullet strike her head. Hours after the girl was rushed to a hospital and as police still searched for her killer without any solid leads, marshmallows and chocolate bars were still scattered over the bed Adams and friends were on, according to the paper. Gang bar: A 24-year-old male was killed in this South Side bar after another male walked inside and opened fire, police say it is known for being a gang hangout . Spattered traces of the 11-year-old girl's blood were observed just under a stuffed Tweety Bird doll hanging on the wall. Adams was enjoying her summer vacation with her friends like any other girl her age. 'They were just doing their girlie things,' a resident of the house who was not home at the time of the shooting told the paper. 'They heard shots and a bullet came through the window.' Adams’ mother was protective of her to . the point the young girl was rarely allowed to go out, those who knew . her say. It was the 11-year-old’s first sleepover. ‘She . don't let Shamiya go much unless she go to family and then the first . time you let her go something like this happens? This is really eating . her up,’ Nanette Dailey told the station. There were three other people shot dead, including a 30-year-old man found with gunshot wounds to his neck, back and shoulder, according to the Chicago Tribune. His dead body was found at 3.00 a.m. Saturday night sitting in a car parked in a gritty alley, cops said. A 24-year-old man was found dead after a gunman opened fire around 2.30 a.m. inside a South Side bar, police told WLS. he had at least one gunshot wound to his chest. The bar is a known street gang hangout, according to the Chicago Tribune, and police believe the murder to be gang-related. Another man with multiple gunshot wounds to his torso was taken from the bar to a hospital in critical condition. Devastated: Shaneetha Goodloe, left, mother of 11-year-old Shamiya Adams who died after being shot Friday night, hugs some of Shamiya's friends during a Saturday vigil near the Chicago apartment building where Shamiya was hit by a stray bullet . On the scene: Police officers and detectives gather Friday night at the home where Adams was shot during a sleepover . A Saturday night block party on the West Side took a violent turn after five people were shot, one dead. The deceased was a 21-year-old male with multiple gunshot wounds to the head and body. He survived the ambulance ride to a nearby hospital but was pronounced dead soon after arriving, police told WMAQ. The four other people injured included a 43-year-old woman and a 53-year-old male cab driver. The 21-year-old and the 43-year-old were getting into the cab when all hell broke loose. She sustained a shot to the leg and a graze wound to the head, the cabbie was shot several times in the abdomen and both thighs - both are in stable condition at a local hospital. ‘I . got nothing left to say to these moms,’ Emanuel continued. ‘I don't . know where they find the strength to go on, put one foot in front of . another. Because she had the... she wanted her daughter to play with her . friends. We're a better city than that.’ But statistics paint a different picture. Despite city officials infamously claiming “crime is down” earlier this year, murders are on pace to at least equal last year’s total. There have so far this year been 223 shooting deaths this year, according to an independent website that tracks crime and mayhem in Chicago. There were 454 shooting deaths in Chicago in 2013. Point of entry: The stray bullet exit hole in the closet wall of the apartment where Adams killed while making s'mores with friends . Among the other injured were four men who showed up Saturday night with unexplained gunshot wounds at a West Side hospital, authorities said. Several people - including a 50-year-old woman, two men playing basketball and multiple men walking on sidewalks in unrelated incidents - showed up at local hospitals saying they 'heard gunshots and felt pain,' police said. Their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening. A male and female were shot while pumping gas after a gunman approached them and opened fire, police said. They drove themselves to the hospital and are in stable condition. Two 15-year-old boys were also shot Saturday evening in unrelated incidents. One suffered only a wound to his leg, the Tribune reported. The other told doctors he was on a sidewalk when someone walked up and shot him in the arm and foot. A 26-year-old was shot Saturday night after arguing with a male in a car parked on the same street corner where he was standing, cops said. The male got out of the car, opened fire and fled. A 23-year-old woman sustained a 'graze wound' in what police believe was an attempted drive by shooting around 5.30 a.m. on the South Side. She refused medical treatment at the scene, police told WMAQ. No arrests have been made in any of the shootings.","Shamiya Adams was killed Friday night when a stray bullet blew threw the wall of a house she was inside for her first sleepover .

"By . Kirk Maltais . Jane Fonda, two-time Oscar winner, has put her Forked Lightning ranch on sale for $19.5 million, saying that she no longer has time to enjoy the property . In the market to buy a ranch? This sprawling New Mexico desert oasis can be yours today... if you have $19.5 million to pony up. Forked Lightning Ranch, located in Santa Fe, has belonged Oscar-winning actress Jane Fonda since 2000, when she purchased it to satisfy her demands for privacy and luxury. She has called the ranch 'an enchanted place.' The exquisite beauty of the home's interior is matched only by the jaw-dropping environment that surrounds it, with views of mountains, rivers, and canyons all nearby. Fonda, 76, says that she is selling the property because, due to her careful balance of life and work, she can no longer make enough time to enjoy the property. Fonda was last seen on screen in the HBO drama 'The Newsroom,' which stars Jeff Daniels and Emily Mortimer. She also released a book in March 2014, her third. 'Forked Lightning Ranch has been a sanctuary and a place of great joy and recreation for me and my family,' says Fonda. 'Many changes have occurred in my life since 2000 and I am no longer able to spend as much time on the Ranch as I once was. I feel the time has come to pass the Ranch on to a new custodian of this enchanted place.' The actress of such notable films as 'Nine To Five' with Dolly Parton and 'Fun With Dick and Jane' with George Segal  redeveloped the 9,585 square foot main home, known as River House.

The ranch also includes the Hacienda - a 2,125 square-foot guest home, a 3,409 square-foot Log House, a 12-stall Equestrian Facility as well as a gym. According to estate agents Swan Land Company, Fonda took 'great care' restoring a three-and-a-half mile stretch of a trout-rich Pecos River, one of the finest fisheries in New Mexico, that bisects the ranch. The estate is on the boundary to the north and east of 311,040 acres of the Pecos National Forest which is part of the 1,558,452 acre Santa Fe National Forest and is 25 miles from the main city. The Pecos River Valley served as a natural spot for those traveling between the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, the southernmost extension of the Rockies, and the Great Plains.

The ranch has a spectacular view of the Pecos River, as well as rock stairs leading down to the river for guests to enjoy . The ranch even boasts of evidence of the wagon route that once passed through the boundaries of the property, where pioneering homesteaders and military traveled. Their tracks still mark the eastern property boundary of the Ranch. Mike Swan, owner and managing broker, said: 'We are honored to be the brokerage representing this significant piece of New Mexico's history.' 'This ranch is unparalleled in its offering of elegant living combined with carefully guarded wilderness, a fine trout fishery and proximity to Santa Fe, one of the country's most sophisticated, culturally-rich and oldest capital cities,' said Swan. Fonda won two Academy Award in the 1970s, the first for the murder mystery 'Klute', co-starring Donald Sutherland in 1971. She received her second Oscar in 1978 for 'Coming Home', a love-triangle drama co-starring Jon Voight. Fonda also enjoyed success in the 1980s with her series of workout tapes. Beginning in 1982 with 'Jane Fonda's Workout,' she produced 11 workout videotapes which sold very well. Her original tape became the highest-selling home video for years after its release.

Fonda retired from acting in the 1990s, only to return in 2005 with 'Monster-in-Law', a movie co-starring Jennifer Lopez. While the movie received negative reviews, it was successful at the box office. According to Swan Land Company, Fonda's extensive personal collection of antiques, artwork, rugs, furniture and her literary collection at River House are available for purchase as well as the ranch equipment and machinery. The real estate firm says that prices of the property additional to the ranch will be negotiable. A complete inventory of personal property and ranch equipment is available by contacting Swan Land Company.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Ambition: JK Rowling says he hopes to write more crime novels than she did Harry Potter books . Author JK Rowling has revealed plans to pen many more crime thrillers and create 'a series' that will run for longer than her hugely successful seven Harry Potter books. The novelist, who has written two whodunnits under the pen name Robert Galbraith, says she loves the crime genre because she can create as many tales as she likes for her character rather than be tied by a single story line. Her comments come after her second crime novel featuring detective Cormoran Strike, The Silkworm, topped the Sunday Times bestseller list last month. Speaking at the Theakstons Old Peculier Crime Writing Festival in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, the multi-millionaire author said she hoped to write ""more than"" seven books about the detective. She said: 'It's pretty open ended. I really love writing, so I don't know that I've got an end point in mind. 'One of the things I love about this genre is unlike Harry Potter, where there was a through line, where there was an overarching story, a beginning and end, you are talking about discreet stories. So while a detective lives, you can keep giving him cases.' The bestselling author, who has been widely credited with helping to get a new generation of children reading with her blockbuster Harry Potter series, said she decided to use a pseudonym for her latest series to prove herself as a writer. She said: 'I wanted to prove to myself that I could get a book published on the merits of the book. 'A friend of mine said, 'Why did you need validation?', and I think possibly you need to be a writer to understand why. Success: JK Rowling said she has always been a huge fan of crime novels and drew inspiration from the genre for her Harry Potter series, which was later turned into a number of major Hollywood films (pictured) 'I had known for a long time that I had this character in my mind, and that I wanted to write a detective series and part of me hoped that I might be able to keep it long enough, kept the story going long enough to establish a series. I just wanted something, I suppose, just for me.' And Rowling revealed she has always been a huge fan of crime novels and drew inspiration from the genre for her Harry Potter series. She said: 'I love crime. I've always loved it. I read a lot of it and I think in many ways, and I think the Harry Potter books in many ways are whodunnits in disguise. 'I enjoy the golden age (crime) book. That's very much what I was trying to do with these books - to take that finite number of suspects - the genuine whodunnit style, but make it very contemporary, make it up to date and make sure this is a credible person and a credible back story.'","Novelist plans to pen many more crime thrillers over the coming years .

"By . Andrew Young . In a moving tribute to celebrate the life of Peter O’Toole, his daughters Kate and Patricia waltzed down the aisle at his funeral. But seven months after mourners gathered to say farewell to the veteran actor, it can be revealed that he treated his girls very differently in his will. O’Toole, who died aged 81 last December, did not leave a penny to Patricia, 50, after being estranged from her for years. Scroll down for video . Mysterious: Peter O'Toole had been estranged from his daughter Patricia (pictured together) for years . Meanwhile, the biggest share of his £4  million estate in England and Wales went to her sister  Kate, 53. The bulk of the rest of it was shared by O’Toole’s son  Lorcan, 31, and the actor’s  teenage granddaughter, Jessica – Patricia’s daughter. The sisters were from O’Toole’s marriage to Welsh actress Sian Phillips. Lorcan was the product of the actor’s relationship with American model Karen Somerville. Irish-born O’Toole – best known for his starring role in Sir David Lean’s 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia – stated in his will that he was making ‘no provision’ for Patricia after being estranged from her ‘for some years’. Their estrangement at the time he wrote his will in January last year has never previously been revealed and the reasons for it are not known. It is not known if the pair were reconciled in the months before his death when he was battling a long illness. Patricia, a business education and arts training consultant, gave no hint of their difficult relationship when she joined her mother and sister at his funeral in Golders Green crematorium in North London in December. She and her sister waltzed down the aisle to the delight of other mourners: O’Toole had done the same at the funeral of his mother Constance. Patricia, who lives with her partner and daughter in Lewes, East Sussex, and still uses her father’s surname, refused to discuss the will or the reasons for their estrangement. Star: The Lawrence of Arabia actor, who died seven months ago at the age of 81, left a net estate of £4,042,516 but omitted his 50-year-old daughter Patricia O'Toole (pictured right at his funeral) from the will . Biggest share: His elder daughter Kate, 53, took the bulk of the estate with a £1.1million share . She said yesterday: ‘I appreciate it is interesting to the public, but it is a personal and family matter. I do not wish to make any comment.’ The disclosure in the will of the estrangement also surprised friends of O’Toole’s family. One told The Mail on Sunday yesterday: ‘I never realised there was any problem between them.’ Details of the will were revealed last week in probate records. The actor left a net estate of £4,042,516, in England and Wales. O’Toole left a series of legacies to family and friends including £200,000 to his ‘beloved’ personal assistant, Lucy Villiers. He left a total of around £760,000 to Lorcan, an actor, made up of a £400,000 legacy and 20 per cent of the residue of his estate in England and Wales after settlement of his other legacies and inheritance tax. Daughter Kate, also an actor, received around £1.1 million made up of 60 per cent of the residuary. She also received all of his property and assets in the Republic of Ireland. The remaining 20 per cent – believed to be around £360,000 – was left for 14-year-old Jessica to claim when she is 18. She also received his Mini Cooper car. 'I never realised there was any problem between them' - A friend of the O'Toole family . O’Toole, who lived in Cricklewood, North London, pointed out in his will that he had ‘many years ago’ given Patricia a 25 per cent share in his  company Keep Films Ltd. He stated that she would receive ‘substantial financial benefit’ from the company after his death, though records show that the 25 per cent shareholding is owned jointly by Patricia and Kate. Latest accounts for the company show it was worth £609,800 last year. O’Toole left all his artwork, books, a ring and his luxury Audemars Piguet watch to Kate. His sister Patricia Coombs received all his theatre posters, photographs and ‘theatre knick-knacks’. Another legacy left all his clothing to the Rugby Football Union’s Injured Players Fund. His remaining chattels were shared by Kate and Lorcan. O’Toole requested that some of his ashes be interred at the actor’s church of St Paul’s in Covent  Garden, London, with an inscription giving his name and the words ‘Goodnight and joy be with you all’. He asked for the rest of his ashes to be interred on his land at Eyrephort near Clifden, County Galway in the Republic of Ireland. O’Toole, the son of an Irish bookmaker, grew up in northern England and worked as a trainee journalist before completing his National Service as a signaller in the Royal Navy. He then attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, alongside Albert Finney and Alan Bates, and started his career on the stage where he won critical acclaim for a 1955 role as Hamlet at the Bristol Old Vic theatre. Patricia (left) and Kate were the products of O'Toole's relationship with actress Sian Phillips (right) O’Toole had hardly any film experience when in 1962 he got the break of a lifetime in Lawrence of Arabia, playing T.  E. Lawrence, the British army officer who led the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Turkish empire during the First World War. The role had been turned down by Marlon Brando and Finney. The four-hour epic, which took two years to make and also starred Omar Sharif, turned him into a household name – and he bought a white Rolls-Royce with his wages. The epic earned him the first of eight Best Actor Oscar nominations – though he never won. He received an honorary Oscar in 2003, having initially turned it down. In a letter, O’Toole asked the  Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to delay the award  until he was 80, saying he was ‘still in the game and might win the  bugger outright’. But when he finally clasped his statuette, he said: ‘Always a bridesmaid, never a bride, my foot.’ He was nominated again in  2006 for his role as a lecherous old actor in the British comedy drama Venus, which also starred Leslie Phillips. 20 per cent of his wealth has gone to his 14-year-old granddaughter Jessica - along with his Mini Cooper . O’Toole had a reputation for riotous behaviour and brawling following bouts of drinking during his younger days. But he was forced to give up alcohol after he had most of his stomach and his pancreas removed in 1976. The surgery left him as an insulin-dependent diabetic, and he then nearly died from a blood disorder in 1978. His 20-year marriage to Ms Phillips, which ended in divorce in 1979, was once one of the most famous couplings in the theatrical world, rivalled only by that of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. Ms Phillips revealed in two biographies that he had subjected her to mental cruelty, largely fuelled by heavy drinking, and was subject to bouts of extreme jealousy after she left him for a younger lover. O’Toole finally announced his retirement from acting after a  50-year career in July 2012, announcing that it was time ‘to chuck in  the sponge’. Prime Minister David Cameron paid tribute to him after his death, praising his ‘stunning’ performance in Lawrence of Arabia which he described as his ‘favourite film’.","Details revealed in probate records last week 7 months after actor's death .

"By . Associated Press . An international AIDS conference opened in Australia on Sunday with a tribute to several delegates who were killed en route to the gathering when their plane was shot down over Ukraine. Officials at the opening ceremony for the 20th International AIDS Conference in Melbourne held a moment of silence for the six AIDS researchers and activists killed aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. All 298 people on board the plane died when it was shot down by a surface-to-air missile Thursday as it flew over rebel-held eastern Ukraine. The 20th International Aids conference opened on Sunday in Melbourne with a tribute to the six researchers who were killed in the MH17 tragedy . Among the passengers was prominent Dutch researcher Joep Lange, former president of the International AIDS Society, and his partner, Jacqueline van Tongeren. Also lost was Pim de Kuijer, of the organisation STOP AIDS NOW!, Lucie van Mens and Maria Adriana de Schutter of AIDS Action Europe, and Glenn Thomas of the World Health Organisation. Around 12,000 scientists and activists from 200 countries are attending the conference to discuss the latest developments in HIV and AIDS research. The president of the International Aids Society, Francoise Barre-Sinoussi, dedicated the conference to those who were killed, and a candlelight vigil will be held on Tuesday to commemorate their lives. Condolence books were also being passed around for attendees to sign. 'It's a really important time for what we think everyone needs, which is a space to grieve and to respect the six members of our community that died on MH17,' conference co-chair Sharon Lewin said. Leading HIV researcher and former president of the International Aids Society Joep Lange was aboard flight MH17 .

Prime Minister Tony Abbott also expressed his deep condolences to the colleagues and friends of the six HIV researchers and lobbyists who died on their way to the conference. 'Australians share with you the pain you feel as this conference commences,' Mr Abbott said via a video message at the opening ceremony of the 20th International AIDS Conference on Sunday. 'The terrible circumstances surrounding the loss of MH17 are a challenge to us all. '298 men, women and children are no longer with us and their passing defies our sense of justice. 'We honour all who have died.' Those in attendance took part in a silent tribute to researchers killed in the tragic crash last week . The President of the International Aids Society dedicated the conference to fallen colleagues, while Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott expressed his deep condolences via a video message . Mr Abbott also highlighted the death of AIDS humanitarian Jonathan Mann, who died in a plane crash on the way to an AIDS conference in 1998. 'Another world leader in the fight against AIDS, Dr Jonathan Mann, who also died in a plane crash, said when speaking of his work - and your work - 'we will prevail together - for we will refuse to be split'. 'We will prevail together'. Delegates who knew the deceased wept as their colleagues were remembered at the conference . Around 12,000 scientists and activists from 200 countries are attending the conference to discuss the latest developments in HIV and AIDS research . He urged everyone 'to rededicate ourselves to the work of those who were lost'. Mr Abbott was unable to travel to Melbourne due to commitments in Canberra as part of the federal government's response to the tragedy, including a meeting of National Security Committee of Cabinet. Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss attended the opening ceremony in place of Mr Abbott. Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down on Thursday in eastern Ukraine and all 298 passengers on board were killed .

"By . Claudia  Joseph . One day he will be king – yet the Prince of Wales on his fifth birthday was more keen on playing one of the most famous outlaws of all time. Smiling at the camera, bow in one hand, he is a Robin Hood ready to take on the world. True, he doesn't have his band of merry men with him but at least he could count on his little sister, the Princess Royal, a fairy accomplice with magic wand. These pictures, exclusively published in today’s Mail on Sunday, have never been seen publicly before. Taken in 1953, they are about to go on display for the first time as part of Buckingham Palace’s summer exhibition, Royal Childhood. Prince Charles on his fifth birthday celebrates by dressing up as Robin Hood. Five months earlier, his mother had been crowned queen . Charles had two birthday parties – the first at Windsor Castle with his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, and aunt, Princess Margaret, while his parents were at a Sandringham shooting party. The Queen and Prince Philip threw a second birthday party for him three days later at Buckingham Palace. An adoring Anne was ever by her brother’s side, as the remaining three images reveal. Taken in December of that year, they show Charles cutting a cake decorated with Father Christmas, jumping out of a box – to his sister’s delight – and playing with his new cart (the toy horse is just out of sight). Fairy princess: The Princess Royal waves her magic wand at the fifth birthday of her elder brother the Prince of Wales on November 14, 1953, five months after their mother was crowned . The pair also adored Charles’s red model motor car, which travelled at 8mph, a birthday gift from his parents. In addition, the prince received an electronic dog from General Alfred Gruenther, then Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, which obeyed commands. The photographs were taken by Jack Wallace Heaton from Wallace Heaton, the most famous photo and camera shop in the world during the 1950s and 1960s. It was eventually taken over by Dixons. Mr Wallace Heaton's son Michael said: ‘My grandfather’s firm, Wallace Heaton, gave the then Princess Elizabeth a camera as a wedding present – I think it was a Rolleiflex – and my dad taught her to take photographs. ‘As a result of that, he got to know the princess very well. He ended up photographing Prince Charles on his way to the Coronation, at his two birthday parties and in a sailor suit. ‘I remember going with my dad to the Royal Tournament at Earls Court and she was also at the performance. Afterwards we all gathered around as she was going to make an appearance – the Queen saw my dad and smiled at him. That memory has lived with me to this day.’ Prince  Charles is pictured cutting a Christmas cake at a party at Buckingham Palace . Palace fun: The future king and his younger sister play during a party held at Buckingham Palace . From the Wallace Heaton Archives   a picture of Prince Charles and Princess Anne at a party at Buckingham Palace in 1953 . The Queen first became interested in photography after her wedding to Prince Philip on November 20, 1947, when Wallace Heaton Ltd sent her a Rolleiflex camera. In a thank-you letter to the directors, management and staff, typed on Buckingham Palace paper and dated December 27, she wrote: ‘It is, I can assure them, a most welcome present and one which I really value.’ But after she started having lessons with Heaton, she began sending him handwritten memos. On January 30, 1951, she sent a note, signed with her initial ‘E’ and enclosing five films for developing. ‘Your criticisms are very helpful,’ she wrote. ‘I cannot quite understand why some of the shots are wrongly exposed but it may be from changing the lens and forgetting to alter the exposure when filming in slow motion.’ Queen Elizabeth, Prince Charles and Princess Anne in August 1955, the day after Queen Elizabeth turned 55 and ten days before Anne celebrated her fifth birthday .

As well as the photographs and costume, the Royal Childhood exhibition has 23 outfits displayed on mannequins and a number of smaller dresses. There is a dressing-up outfit belonging to Queen Victoria’s son Prince Alfred and a photograph of the Queen, then Princess Elizabeth, and Princess Margaret in a 1941 performance of Cinderella. Anna Reynolds, the curator, said: ‘This exhibition emphasises the universality of childhood. Queen Victoria’s children would often put on a Christmas tableau for their family and there are lots of photos of them dressing up. ‘It is a tradition that continued into the 20th Century with the Queen and Princess Margaret. We also see the Royal Family dressing up for children’s birthday parties. ’","New Buckingham Palace summer exhibition on Royal childhood .

"By . Sean Poulter . and Peter Campbell . Firms fear if they cut prices ahead of the winter, a victory for Ed Miliband next May would see them forced to stick with these new tariffs . Energy giants are refusing to pass on lower wholesale gas prices to customers ahead of the General Election in response to Labour’s threat to impose a price freeze. The firms fear that if they cut prices ahead of the winter, a victory for Ed Miliband next May would see them forced to stick with these new tariffs for at least 20 months. The net effect means that Labour’s price promise freeze – which it heralded as the key part of its drive to help struggling families cope with increases in the cost of living – has backfired spectacularly. The wholesale price of gas to be supplied next winter is down by around 20 per cent compared to the winter of 2013-14, and this reduction, which could be worth £50 per household, would normally be passed on. Wholesale electricity costs are down too – the two are inextricably linked because gas is used to fuel some power stations. However, one of the most senior executives at a ‘big six’ energy supplier told the Daily Mail: ‘We don’t expect to see any reduction in tariffs this side of the General Election. 'If you have the prospect of a 20-month price freeze should Labour win the General Election, energy companies will not want to be locked in to a lower price.’ He added: ‘To some extent, the decision on whether to pass on the lower wholesale price depends on the polls. If they point to a Labour win, then reductions in bills are unlikely. If Labour is falling behind, the industry may feel they are safe in making reductions.’ The result of the Labour price freeze promise and the industry’s response is that bills are likely to be artificially inflated all through next winter. Some City analysts had already warned that Labour’s policy would backfire, however the admission from the energy industry insider is proof positive that this is the case. Peter Lilley MP, the former Tory Cabinet minister and a member of the Commons Energy and Climate Change Select Committee, said: ‘This was always a fear when Labour announced their proposal. 'The concern was that companies would resist any downward pressure on prices ahead of an election. ‘It seems that prices are being held higher than necessary at the moment and if Labour were to win the election they would be frozen at this higher point for 20 months afterwards. 'Effectively, the shadow of a possible Labour government is having very serious negative consequences for consumers and the wider economy.’ Energy analyst Peter Atherton, of Liberum Partners, previously warned that Labour’s price freeze would lead to higher, not lower, prices. ‘This doesn’t surprise me at all,’ he told the Mail yesterday. ‘There should now be scope for price reductions, and if we were in a normal and non-political environment you would be very confident of material price reductions in the autumn.’ He said the net effect would be that energy companies would seek to buy large amounts of gas and power ahead of 2015/16 to protect them against the impact of a price freeze. As a result, he said: ‘Costs to consumers are very likely to be higher than they otherwise would be.’ The industry regulator Ofgem is alarmed that energy companies have failed to pass on the recent falls in wholesale costs to customers. It has referred the industry to an inquiry by the Competition and Markets Authority, which will investigate allegations of profiteering. However, it has no power to force the firms to cut tariffs now. Recent figures from Ofgem show the average annual profit margin the big six energy firms are making per customer has more than doubled in the past year to £101. Labour MP John Robertson has called for massive fines if any of the companies are found guilty of rigging the market and bills. He said: ‘If they are found guilty, the tens of millions in fines should go straight back into the pockets of consumers who have been ripped off all these years.’","Firms fear they will have to stick with cut prices in Labour wins .

"By . Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent . The Serious Fraud Office is set to launch a criminal probe within days into manipulation of the ‘Wild West’ foreign currency market to see if London bankers benefited. Regulators have already looked into claims that traders at banks worldwide conspired to rig benchmark rates used by the £3trillion-a-day Forex market. A criminal investigation would be a major embarrassment for the City, where around 40 per cent of the world’s foreign exchange is traded. City: The Serious Fraud Office is set to launch a criminal probe into manipulation of the 'Wild West' foreign currency market to see if London bankers benefited. It would be a major embarrassment for the City (pictured) Sources say Britain’s main fraudbuster is days away from what would be a significant development in the scandal, which is already under investigation by a raft of other organisations. An SFO spokesman last night said it was ‘receiving and examining complex data’. He added: ‘If and when we open a criminal investigation, that decision will be announced in the usual way.’ An announcement is expected to be linked to extra funding being granted to the SFO from the Treasury. The . SFO is already involved with a number of high profile and expensive . probes including the alleged manipulation of bank interest rates known . as Libor. Under investigation: Several high street banks have been dragged into the probe into the unregulated foreign exchange rate market - likened to the 'Wild West'. Barclays (pictured) has confirmed it is being investigated . Several . high street banks have been dragged into the probe into the unregulated . foreign exchange rate market – likened by whistleblowers to the ‘Wild . West’. Banks buy and sell foreign currency on behalf of clients, but traders can also bet on whether a currency will move up or down in value. Regulators in the United States, Asia and Europe suspect that traders have manipulated benchmark currency rates so they can rig their own bets. Grilling: Governor Mark Carney was grilled over the Bank of England's involvement in the scandal by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee earlier this year . The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has already been looking into claims that bank staff are making foreign currency trades before processing customers’ orders. It has previously emerged that a senior currency trader at emerging markets specialist Standard Chartered, formerly employed at Barclays and then Swiss bank UBS, had been suspended. Around 30 bankers at 10 banks have been suspended since last Summer. Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS and Deutsche Bank have all confirmed they are being investigated. Even the Bank of England was dragged into the investigation when it suspended one of its own officials earlier this year. It also hired law firm Travers Smith to look into whether its staff had been involved in or turned a blind eye to manipulation of the Forex markets. Governor Mark Carney was grilled over the Bank’s involvement in the scandal by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee earlier this year. He faced questions about Martin Mallett, the Bank’s chief currency dealer, who is known as The Hammer. Mallett chaired the foreign exchange joint standing committee chief dealers sub group - a forum to discuss issues with the City’s most senior currency traders - since 2005. It emerged that the issue of possible Forex market manipulation was first raised at a meeting of the group in July 2006. The Bank has been looking into whether the group failed to properly record or pass on evidence of market manipulation.","Regulators have already looked into claims traders rigged benchmark rates .

"By . Ian Drury . Justice Secretary Chris Grayling vowed to ¿slay the health and safety culture¿ . Employees who hurt themselves doing ‘something dumb’ at work will no longer win compensation if bosses have taken steps to keep them safe. Under tough new laws, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling vowed to ‘slay the health and safety culture’ which had sparked a wave of legal claims for big payouts. He warned society had become ‘too inclined to blame someone else’ when things go wrong, pledging to make it harder for ambulance-chasing lawyers to win cases in court. Fear of being sued dissuades small businesses from hiring extra staff and schools have reined in the number and type of trips they take pupils on over concerns they could face legal action if trouble arises – even when they have taken reasonable safety steps. In a case last year, Norfolk policewoman Kelly Jones threatened to sue a garage boss after tripping over a 6in kerb while answering a midnight call. She dropped the case following a public outcry and criticism from her own chief constable. Mr Grayling’s Social Action, Responsibility and Heroism Bill will be debated by MPs for the first time today. He is determined to turn the tide on the compensation culture which costs businesses, charities and local authorities millions and boosts insurance premiums. WPC Kelly Jones dropped the case following public outcry and criticism from her own chief constable . ‘This is a Bill that’s out to try and slay the health and safety culture,’ he said. ‘It is about trying to restore common sense to the kind of situations which happen all too often and very seldom get to court – where somebody has an accident at work, it’s entirely their own fault, they have got a perfectly responsible employer who has the normal health and safety procedures in place but that person does something dumb …  and sues the employer anyway.’ The Bill means a court deciding a negligence case will have to consider whether the defendant was acting for the benefit of society, such as running an event or clearing snow from a path. Judges will also have to weigh up whether a person facing a compensation claim had demonstrated a ‘generally responsible’ approach to safety. Mr Grayling added: ‘I want a society where common sense is the order of the day, not one where responsible employers are prevented from growing their businesses for constant fear of being sued for slips and trips if something goes wrong … If someone has acted responsibly to protect the safety of others … the law will be on their side.’ The Bill was applauded by voluntary groups who have warned that fear of litigation stops many people from offering their services. But unions said it raised concerns about the potential impact on employees injured at work.","Chris Grayling vowed to ‘slay the health and safety culture’

"By . Ian Drury, Home Affairs Correspondent . Most council bosses have defied government demands for pay restraint by handing out huge salaries while cutting services. Around 61 per cent of councils paid their biggest earners more than the Prime Minister, who receives £142,500 a year. The highest salary was thought to be the £318,500 paid by Somerset County Council – which is cutting jobs and services to save £18million – to Peter Lewis, director of children’s services. Large payout: Most councils have defied demands for pay restraint by handing out huge salaries while cutting services. Somerset County Council (above) paid £318,500 to its director of children's services, Peter Lewis . Mr Lewis, who was on a temporary . contract after being hired through an agency, was appointed following a . highly-critical report by education watchdog Ofsted. Somerset Council hit the headlines . recently over the absence of chief executive Sheila Wheeler, who . received a package worth £198,000, during the West Country floods which . devastated large parts of the county. Staff sparked anger by refusing . to reveal her whereabouts after she had not been to work in her . flood-stricken county for three months. She later left her job for undisclosed reasons – but it was thought to be linked with a row with senior staff. Prime Minister: Around 61 per cent of councils paid their biggest earners more than David Cameron, who receives £142,500 a year . The huge payouts come at a time when the . council is cutting jobs, youth and community services, and sheltered . housing in an attempt to save £18million. Since 2011, six out of ten councils have . raised its highest paid official’s salary - despite calls for . belt-tightening as the economy begins to recover. It will raise concerns . that public sector bodies still ‘do not get’ the need to rein in . profligate spending as Britain continues to drag itself out of . recession. Among the highest-paying 20 councils, only five reduced their top salary after ministers called for more austerity. Dia Chakravarty, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance campaign group, said: ‘Sky-high public sector salaries are unacceptable and highlight the need for the war on waste. ‘Increasing the cost of a single role by £150,000 in a single year is astonishing, particularly when savings have to be made elsewhere. ‘Even if part of the money is going to agencies to find the right person, it still shows a lack of prudence.’ Other councils that bumped up their top salary included Wandsworth Council in south-west London from £174,271 to nearly £216,000 – more than £41,000 – and Birmingham by almost £13,000 to £212,000. Labour-controlled Stoke-on-Trent City Council, meanwhile, approved a £5,000 salary increase for chief executive John van de Laarschot on the day it agreed to slash £21million from services. The official who dressed as Superman to abseil down a building for charity, saw his pay increased to £195,516 – part of an overall package including perks and pension worth £232,000. Dave Conway, leader of Stoke’s opposition City Independent group, said: ‘We’ve lost swimming pools, libraries and old people’s homes. I don’t know how the council can justify paying one man all this money at the same time.’ Approval: Labour-controlled Stoke-on-Trent City Council (above) approved a £5,000 salary increase for chief executive John van de Laarschot on the day it agreed to slash £21million from services . Stoke-on-Trent Council defended Van de Laarschot’s pay, saying the city needed someone with the ‘ability to effectively manage the delivery of complex services, and to drive jobs and growth for residents.’ John Osman, leader of Somerset County Council, said the high salaries were justified because Ofsted inspections had ‘highlighted that our child protection services were not good enough’.

"By . Paul Hirst, Press Association . Bryan Robson expects Robin van Persie to captain Manchester United next season. One of Louis van Gaal's biggest priorities in his new role as United boss is to select a captain following the summer exit of Nemanja Vidic. After spending 10 years at the club Wayne Rooney was tipped to take the captain's armband, but Van Persie skippered the Dutch national side at the World Cup and he enjoys a good relationship with the new man in charge at Old Trafford. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal and Manchester United touch down in USA . Leader: Bryan Robson expects Robin van Persie (above) to captain Manchester United next season . Last week Van Gaal said he would take time to decide who should take the honour, and Robson appears to think the Dutchman has already made up his mind. 'Robin was his captain of Holland, so that is an obvious one,' United's former 'Captain Marvel' said. 'I would be really surprised if he didn't give Robin it.' The close bond between Van Gaal and Van Persie was clear to see throughout the World Cup. The pair spoke publicly about their admiration for each other and Van Persie raced over to the bench following his stunning opening goal against Spain to give his manager a big high five. Main man: New Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal (right) also selected Van Persie as the Holland captain . Van Gaal defied his critics to guide Holland to the semi-finals of the World Cup before they were knocked out by Argentina on penalties. Robson believes Holland's run to the last four bodes well for United, who finished seventh last year under David Moyes. 'He has been a winner all his coaching career so hopefully he will install that back into the club,' said Robson, who played 461 times during a 13-year spell at United. 'In the World Cup Holland were very good. Tactically he got them really well-drilled and I thought they were very unlucky. I thought they were better than Argentina, and they could have gone all the way.' Van Gaal has put his squad through tough training sessions since landing in Los Angeles, where United kick off their pre-season campaign on Wednesday against LA Galaxy. The players in the 25-man squad, which includes new signings Anders Herrera and Luke Shaw, have been keen to impress their new manager, who was appointed as Moyes' successor in May. The pain and disappointment of last year's dismal showing under the Scot will also be driving the players on, according to Robson. 'The fans and the club were disappointed last year, but nobody hurts more than players,' said Robson, who won two Premier Leagues, one Cup Winners' Cup and three FA Cups during his time at Old Trafford. Figurehead: Van Persie helped guide Holland to third place in the 2014 World Cup . 'I know these players. They have won the title, the Champions League, and a lot of them were really disappointed about what happened so the lads that are still at the club will want to bounce back, they will want to prove to people that they are top players and they can win things.' Robson thinks United could fall short though unless they sign a centre-back. Last season United conceded 43 goals. After losing Vidic, Rio Ferdinand and possibly Patrice Evra, Robson is concerned United lack experience in their back line. 'When you lose three class defenders like that you need to bring in a really top-drawer centre-half to the club. That would really give us a chance of winning the title,' Robson said. In charge: Van Gaal in action during a training session as part of Manchester United's pre-season in Los Angeles . 'You look back over the years and United have had Nemanja and Rio as a pairing, Brucey (Steve Bruce) and Pally (Gary Pallister). 'Then we had Jaap Stam. He was a really dominant and aggressive player and we need one of those to come in to the club.' Robson believes Bruno Martins Indi would have been the ideal signing for United.

"By . David Kent . Pop singer Rihanna broke World Cup etiquette when she got her hands on the trophy during Germany’s post-match party. FIFA guidelines have previously said that only winners of the tournament and heads of state are allowed to handle the official World Cup Trophy. Rules: Rihanna holds the World Cup with  Miroslav Klose but guidelines state she should not have touched it . Revealing: Rihanna lifts her top after Germany beat Argentina to win the World Cup . Stuck in the middle with you: Rihanna holds the World Cup while Lucas Podolski and Bastian Schweinsteiger kiss her . Cheerleader: Pop star Rihanna poses with Podolski, Schweinsteiger and match winner Mario Gotze . Indeed, England’s Wayne Rooney and Daniel Sturridge have previously been forced to observe this practice during promotional events in the UK. But Rihanna – who had earlier lifted her top inside the Maracana during Germany’s 1-0 win over Argentina – was pictured holding the solid-gold prize and later revealed she had kissed and posed for a ‘selfie’ with the famous trophy. Wives, girlfriends and children of the Germany players were also pictured with the trophy during the celebrations in Rio and it appears FIFA have relaxed their rules regarding the 18-carat gold prize. Man of the moment: Mario Gotze and his girlfriend Ann-Kathrin Broemmel celebrate with the trophy . Hold on tight: Sami Khedira and his girlfriend Lena Gercke with the World Cup trophy in their grasp . They've got the whole world in their hands: Kevin Grosskreutz, Shkodran Mustafi, Per Mertesacker and Bastian Schweinsteiger celebrating with the famous trophy .

All smiles: Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche, Germany's head coach Joachim Low and IOC president Thomas Bach . Earlier in the day Rihanna posted a picture of herself and football legend Pele soon after she landed in Brazil ahead of the final. And on Monday she tweeted: 'I touched the cup, held the cup, kissed the cup, took a selfie with the cup!!! I meeeaan...... what is YO bucket list looking like bruh?' Match-winner Mario Gotze was one of several players pictured with Rihanna and, speaking after the victory, he said: 'It’s unbelievable. I scored but I didn’t really know what was happening. ‘A dream has become a reality and we are going to have a great party. It is absolutely sensational. ‘It wasn’t a simple tournament for me. I owe a lot to my friends and family.’ Chancellor Angela Merkel and president Joachim Gauck were also present at the post-game party. Germany’s win was their fourth World Cup triumph and third since the current trophy was first used in 1974, when Franz Beckenbauer led the hosts to victory. However, they will not get to keep the trophy on a permanent basis – as Brazil did with the Jules Rimet Trophy following their third success - and will instead be presented with a gold-plated replica.","Rihanna posted pictures on Twitter holding the World Cup Trophy alongside players including Bastian Schweinsteiger and Lukas Podolski .

"By . Rory Dollard . Double Olympic champion Laura Trott refuses to go to war with her Great Britain team-mates despite being pitted against each other at the Commonwealth Games. Trott won team pursuit gold at London 2012 in a world-record time alongside Dani King and Joanna Rowsell, but all three will be lining up for England in the individual pursuit in Glasgow on Friday. They will also be up against their Team GB colleagues Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald, who ride for Wales and Scotland respectively. Focused: Trott will not go to war with her GB team-mates despite going head-to-head in Glasgow . Determined: Trott tasted success at London 2012 when she won gold in the team pursuit . That promises to lend an interesting dynamic to the competition, but Trott has no intention of adding any extra edge despite a late change in preparation. 'Our coach has this red book where he jots down all our times and he's decided that he's showing us one by one now so that we can't see how other people have done,' revealed Trott. 'I'm like 'this is all getting a bit serious'. I just want to see what people are doing. 'It's so weird, because we weren't doing that the previous week and after this week we'll be team-mates again. It is strange.' Trott explained that the rather unusual Team Scotland outfit for the opening ceremony - an eye-catching and unconventional affair - had been expected to cause Archibald some grief, but she has taken a different approach. 'I don't think there's many mind games between us but you get the odd comment every now again. I read the other day that the Scottish opening and closing outfits were made to create war because we're going to be like 'oh they look horrible' or whatever. Rivals: Trott will face Archibald, left, and Barker, who are representing Scotland and Wales respectively . 'So with Katie I've been saying, 'Oh it looks amazing'. She's like 'Do I look amazing or don't I? She can't tell whether I'm lying, but it's certainly not war for me.' Rowsell, who won individual pursuit gold at World Championships in Cali this year and will be chasing another success in Glasgow, is keen not to sidetracked into seeing the event as a straight shootout between the home nations riders. The 25-year-old, who is looking forward to wearing English colours for purely aesthetic reasons, expects a fierce challenge for the podium from all angles. 'It's much easier to have your nails painted with an England flag rather than a Great Britain one, that will make life easier,""' she said. Close: Trott in action for GB alongside Archibald, King and Barker at the European Championships . 'But it is quite a different atmosphere here because we are all doing our own thing and you do want to know what your rivals are doing. But they aren't my only rivals because you have the other girls from Australia, Canada and New Zealand who are all really strong nations in women's endurance cycling.

"By . Guy Aspin, Press Association . Will Sharman continued his impressive form ahead of the Commonwealth Games with another quick time - even if he lost out in a three-way photo finish in the 110 metres hurdles at Horse Guards Parade on Sunday. Running on a purpose-built track in the shadow of Whitehall and St James' Park at the Sainsbury's Anniversary Games, the 29-year-old, who is in the form of his life after twice running a personal best of 13.21 seconds this summer, clocked 13.24secs into a slight headwind. The bad news was it was only good enough for third, Sharman just edged out by American World Championship silver medallist Ryan Wilson, who was credited with the win, and Shane Brathwaite from Barbados, with all three given the same time. Form of his life: 110m hurdler Will Sharman is preparing for the Commonwealth Games . Jumper: The 110m hurdler came third at Horse Guards Parade on Sunday . But he took the scalp of Olympic champion and world record holder Aries Merritt, while the time maintained Sharman's hugely encouraging recent run, which has most notably included a victory over world number one and Commonwealth rival Hansle Parchment of Jamaica at Hampden Park last weekend. Sharman, the Commonwealth silver medallist four years ago, told Press Association Sport: ""The times I am running on average now would get medals at all of the championships. 'Before it would take a World Championship final for me to run a personal best, now I'm doing them in rain, hail or shine. 'I'm running quicker than I do in the finals. So hopefully, given the way I've been operating in the past, when the final comes I lift my game and step up again. 'That's what I'm working towards, making my average time much faster so, even if I get to the final and have a bad race, we can come away with something.' Horse Guards Parade was used memorably for beach volleyball at London 2012 and staged jousts during the reign of Henry VIII, but Paralympic champion Jonnie Peacock came off second best again in his tussle with American Richard Browne.

Allyson Felix responded to a storming start from Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce to win the 100m, bursting through in the second half of the race to beat her Jamaican rival, the two-time reigning Olympic champion, into second, although a faulty clock meant she was unable to find out her time. There were also victories for Paralympic champions Hannah Cockroft in the T34 100m and Aled Davies in the F42 shot put, London 2012 silver medallist Stef Reid in the F42/44 long jump and world champion Sophie Hahn in the T37/38 100m.","110 metre hurdler finishes third in photo finish at Anniversary Games .

Positive thinking can ease pain by altering how you experience it, a study claims. Just five minutes of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) led to a reduction in pain of nearly 60 per cent. Scientists at the University of Reading used thermal probes to apply heat to the arms of 34 volunteers, generating pain similar to experiencing a burn. When the participants were asked to rate the pain’s severity, those who had undergone ‘pain-training’ therapy beforehand gave scores 58 per cent lower than a control group. The finding suggests CBT could help treat conditions such as chronic back pain. A total of 34 men and women aged 21 to 38 took part in the 'mind over body' study. In a series of hour-long sessions, a thermal probe was used to apply heat to their forearms and evoke pain. The stimulation generated secondary hyperalgesia, or enhanced pain sensitivity beyond the site of an injury - a common feature of burns. Lead researcher Dr Tim Salomons, from the University of Reading, said: 'Of the 34 participants given secondary hyperalgesia, half were trained to control negative thoughts related to the pain, the other half was given training unrelated to the pain stimuli. 'We then examined the groups' secondary hyperalgesia. The results were striking. The 'pain-trained' group achieved a 38 per cent reduction in secondary hyperalgesia, while the control group reported an increase of 8 per cent. 'We know that pain feels more debilitating when it signals illness or injury compared to when we are undertaking an activity we feel is beneficial - we go through the pain barrier. 'However we didn't know whether our beliefs simply changed the emotional response to pain or if the mind actually changed sensations that arise from the body - until now.' The CBT-trained group also reduced the self-reported 'unpleasantness' of the eight pain sessions by 58 per cent, said Dr Salomons. This indicated that CBT changed the emotional response to pain as well as the sensitivity of skin around the burn. Change of tact: Experts claim a 'mind over body' approach is the way to overcome feelings of pain . Each year more than five million people in the UK develop chronic pain. Back pain alone is believed to cost British business 4.9 million work days a year as a result of employee absenteeism. The kind of CBT used, designed to alter 'distorted and unhelpful' pain-related thoughts, was adapted 'almost entirely' from a commonly available manual, said Dr Salomons. 'At-home cognitive treatments, working in tandem with other treatments, could make a difference to NHS finances and waiting times as well as improving the lives of chronic pain sufferers,' he added. He conducted the research, published in the journal Pain, while working at the University of Toronto in Canada.","University of Reading gave a group 'pain-training' therapy before tests .

"By . Australian Associated Press . HIV diagnoses in Australia have hit 20-year highs, and about one in seven people living with the virus don't know they have it and risk transmitting the virus to others. An annual surveillance report says about 26,800 people are living with HIV in Australia and about 14 per cent of them don't know they have it. The national report compiled by University of NSW's Kirby Institute found 1235 people were diagnosed with the virus in 2013. HIV diagnoses have hit 20-year highs, with about 26,800 people living with HIV in Australia . Lead author Associate Professor David Wilson said the percentage of people who are not aware they have HIV is 'probably' lower in Australia than in almost any other country in the world. 'But we know that the people that are undiagnosed are firstly not in to care and therefore the virus is not effectively being managed,' he said. 'They need treatment for their own health, but secondarily, people that are undiagnosed are more likely to transmit the virus to other people.' The report also showed about 60 per cent of people with HIV in Australia were being treated, compared to about 25 per cent of people with HIV in the US. About one in seven people living with the virus don't know they have it and risk transmitting the virus to others . Another report shows unprotected anal intercourse among casual male partners continues to be a key transmitter of HIV among gay men in Australia. The Trends in Behaviour report, by UNSW's Centre for Social Research in Health, found that 35 per cent of men with casual partners said they had unprotected anal sex in the six months before the survey, with rates close to 60 per cent among HIV-positive men with casual partners. Earlier this month, the federal government set a target of cutting sexual transmission of HIV in half by 2015, and to reach zero by 2020. It also announced plans to increase access to kits that allow people to test at home. The report also showed about 60 per cent of people with HIV in Australia were being treated, compared to about 25 per cent of people with HIV in the US . Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations executive director Rob Lake said that to achieve the goal of ending HIV transmission, a concerted effort would be needed to get gay men to use condoms. Improved access to drugs that help prevent HIV transmission was also needed, he said. 'Rapid and home testing for HIV are proving more and more popular and access to them needs to be expanded,' he said. 'We also need to keep the conversation about HIV prevention and stigma happening amongst gay men and the broader community. 'This has begun but we need support and action from government, health providers and our community to make it effective.'

"By . Sophie Borland . A leading academic has warned too little is known about the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering statins . Giving statins to five million more patients is ‘foolhardy’ and ‘unsafe’, according to an Oxford academic. Professor Klim McPherson warned that too little is known about the side effects of the drugs which include type 2 diabetes and muscular pain. Tomorrow, the NHS watchdog NICE is expected to publish new guidelines urging GPs to offer them to anyone with a 10 per cent risk of developing heart disease within a decade. Presently they are only given to those with a 20 per cent risk and around seven million Britons take them. They cost as little as 10p a day and work by lowering cholesterol in the blood, thereby preventing the arteries becoming clogged with fatty deposits. But leading GPs, cardiologists and academics are concerned that not enough is known about side effects which include memory problems, dizziness, type 2 diabetes and muscular pain. They point out that very little research has been carried out into these risks and how many patients are affected. And it has also emerged that six of the 12 experts drawing up the guidelines have financial ties to drugs firms who make statins or similar pills. But NICE said the pills have the potential to save thousands of lives over the years at a minimum cost to the health service as they are so cheap. In a letter to the BMJ, Professor McPherson, who specialises in public health epidemiology, wrote: ‘Recommending that five million more people take statins lifelong for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease without knowing enough about the side effects is foolhardy. He said: ‘The data on side effects need to be public and scrutinised by qualified independent assessors. Professor McPherson said the only studies to look at the effectiveness of statins had been funded by manufacturers, so were therefore biased. They may well overstate the drug’s effectiveness while underplaying any risks. Professor McPherson warned that the same tactics had been used by firms making HRT who had downplayed the risk of heart disease. Similarly, manufacturers or the oral contraceptive pill had published work which had underestimated their link to blood clots. Last week figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre showed prescriptions for statins had trebled in a decade with 58.1 million handed out last year. The rise is partly due to an incentive scheme for GPs, the Quality and Outcomes Framework, whereby they earn extra money for prescribing statins for high risk patients. Statins cost as little as 10p per day and work by lowering cholesterol in the blood, thereby preventing the arteries becoming clogged . Other experts say the benefits by far outweigh the risks including Professor George Davey Smith, clinical epidemiologist at Bristol University, who claims ‘the jury is no longer out’. Speaking earlier this month, he added: ‘Trials have shown unequivocally that statins reduce coronary heart disease mortality and there are very low levels of severe side effects. ‘We are not forcing these tablets down people’s throats, we are giving people the evidence on which to make a decision.’ And Maureen Talbot, Senior Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘The prescription of cholesterol lowering medications has been increasing steadily for many years now. ‘This reflects the efforts that have been made to better identify people at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease through initiatives such as the NHS Health Checks programme. ‘Statins are one of the most studied medicines available today. They have been proven to be safe and effective and are vital in helping reduce people’s risk of heart attack and stroke.’","Oxford academic and Professor Klim McPherson warns too little is known about the side effects of cholesterol-lowering statins .

"By . Sophie Borland, Health Correspondent . Women who have suffered from depression or anxiety face being quizzed by GPs about whether they plan to have babies. New guidelines also instruct family doctors to inquire if they are using contraception. Health watchdog NICE says women need to be warned they may suffer a relapse during pregnancy or after the birth, which may affect their ability to care for the newborn. Scroll down for video . Women who have suffered from depression or anxiety face being quizzed by GPs about whether they plan to have babies (file picture) There is also very strong evidence that antidepressants raise the risk of miscarriage, premature births and foetal abnormalities. Its guidelines do not suggest GPs should deter women with a history of depression or other mental health conditions from having babies. But campaigners said it was ‘intrusive’ for doctors to even raise the topic during a routine appointment and make women think they weren’t ready for motherhood. Well over a quarter of women receive treatment for a mental health disorder during their lives, most commonly depression, anxiety and eating disorders. They are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed, which may be partly due to their biology as well as the fact they are more inclined to admit it. Roger Goss of Patient Concern said: ‘What’s it got to do with the GP? It’s intrusive. They should mind their own business. Depression is a very vague concept and I’m sure all of us have suffered from it to some degree. I wonder how they expect GPs to choose their targets.’ Marjorie Wallace, of the charity Sane, said: ‘It would be a shame if these guidelines alarm the majority of people who may have suffered some kind of anxiety and depression. They must not be deterred.’ Over the last few months NICE – which receives £60million of public money a year –  has issued a spate of guidelines described  as ‘nannying’. Campaigners said it was 'intrusive' for doctors to even raise the topic during a routine appointment (file picture) This latest one – aimed at GPs as well as counsellors and psychiatrists – states: ‘Discuss with all women of present and future childbearing potential who have a new, existing or past mental health problem the use of contraception and any plans for a pregnancy.’ It says any advice should be given in a ‘non-judgmental’ and ‘compassionate’ way. Professor Mark Baker, director of the Centre for Clinical Practice at NICE, said: ‘It is really important that a woman is able to make an informed decision about her treatment and she is helped to weigh up the risks and benefits of stopping, starting or changing their drug treatment.’","NICE say women need to be warned they may suffer relapse during pregnancy .

He broke the news on his Google+ page, saying: 'Status: Super Excited', alongside an Amazon logo. Scroll down for video . Babak Parviz designed the optics in google glass and the firm';s smart contact lens - and is now moving to Amazon to work on a secret project . Google's smart contact lens can measure glucose levels in tears using a tiny wireless chip and miniaturized glucose sensor that are embedded between two layers of soft contact lens material. Prototypes generate a reading once per second. Google is also investigating the potential for this to serve as an early warning for the wearer, integrating tiny LED lights that could light up to indicate that glucose levels have crossed above or below certain thresholds. Parviz worked in Google's secretive 'X' lab, where he worked on both glass and a smart contact lens to measure glucose levels in diabetics. He previously worked as an affiliate professor at the University of Washington, and worked at Microsoft of a smart contact lens system. He updated his Google+ profile late last night to reflect the move. 'I founded and led a few efforts at Google (among them, Google Glass and Google Contact Lenses are public so far :) prior to moving to Amazon and work on a few other things now...' He stopped working on the Glass team in December last year. 'After founding, building, and running the Google Glass team for nearly 40 months, I stepped down this year,' he said at the time.

The move comes after Amazon recently revealed its first smartphone, the Fire. The Fire will use head-tracking technology to make images on the smartphone's display appear to be 3D with a feature called 'dynamic perspective'. 'There is always more to see by changing your perspective,' Amazon boss Jeff Bezos said at its introduction. Dr. Babak Parviz has joined amazon in a high profile move that has sparked rumours the firm it developing a smart contact lens . 'What if there were a thousand artists standing by to redraw the picture every time you moved your head?' Apps using the new feature includes a Maps app that lets users see around buildings. Users can also tilt the phone to 'look around' an on screen map. Amazon also announced that the Fire Phone will come with a new app called Firefly. This uses the camera and visual recognition to identify objects ranging from books to CDs as well as listen to music before looking for it on Amazon. The feature will also recognise phone numbers and web addresses, as well as TV shows. Amazon claims it can recognise 100 million items in less than one second. Once an item is recognised, it can automatically take users to the corresponding Amazon page so they can buy it. The app is triggered by holding the same button that serves as a shortcut to the Fire Phone's camera.

"By . Mark Prigg . Airbus has filed a patent for a new kind of economy seats which makes passengers sit on something akin to a bicycle saddles. The so-called saddle seating would allow the firm to fit far more passengers into flights lasting 'a couple of hours'. When the seats are not in use, the would flip up to create more space in the cabin. Airbus has filed a seat patent that has cushions are shaped liked bicycle saddles. 'In effect, to increase the number of cabin seats, the space allotted to each passenger must be reduced,' the patent application states. Each of the bicycle seats is fastened to a vertical bar, and the seats retract to increase space when not in use. Airbus officials say the patent request does not mean the seat will be commercialised. 'Many, if not most, of these concepts will never be developed, but in case the future of commercial aviation makes one of our patents relevant, our work is protected,” Airbus spokeswoman Mary Anne Greczyn told the LA Times. The new seat design would allow airlines to fit seats closer together in economy. Seats would flip up when not in use to allow passengers to easily move through their row. However, the firm admits in the patent filing the system would only work for short flights. 'Reduced comfort remains tolerable for the passengers in as much as the flight lasts only one or a few hours,' Airbus says. However, it also admits the while gaps between seats can shrink, airline passengers are not.'This second solution has also been pursued hitherto,' the patent application reads, . 'and it is difficult to continue to further reduce this distance between the seats because of the increase in the average size of the passengers.' The 'Skyrider', a seat first proposed in 2011, shows how thwe concept could look. Passengers sit at an angle with just 23 inches of legroom between them and the seat in front - a whopping seven inches less than the current average seat pitch of around 30 inches.","Seat flips doen the give passengers a 'saddle' to sit on .

"By . Brendan Carlin . Commons Speaker John Bercow is embroiled in a row over claims that a £200,000-a-year Westminster job is to be given to an Australian woman – even though a rival male candidate is better qualified. Australian parliament official Carol Mills is favourite to succeed outgoing Commons Clerk Sir Robert Rogers, whose departure follows claims he was told to ‘**** off’ by Mr Bercow. Ms Mills is one of two women on a shortlist of three, drawn up by a panel including Mr Bercow. Shortlist: Carol Mills is allegedly the favourite to succeed Sir Robert Rogers at Commons Clerk . She flew to the UK to meet the Speaker and the rest of the interview panel – reportedly at taxpayers’ expense – and is due to be interviewed again. Insiders at Westminster say Ms Mills, who is in charge of Australia’s Department of Parliamentary Services, is the strong favourite, despite claims the sole male on the list, David Natzler, is better qualified. The third person on the list is a female Whitehall official. A source said the hopes of Mr Natzler – Sir Robert’s deputy – had been hit because he is an Old Etonian, but added that he was of 'humble immigrant stock' who had won a scholarship to attend the school. ‘Natzler knows the job inside out, but the politically correct obsession of some people means the Aussie woman is the favourite,’ said a source. ‘Just because he went to Eton, Natzler is up against it, even though he got there by raw  talent and came from a humble background. It’s bonkers.’ Row: Sources claim Bercow has shunned her better-qualified rival because he is an Old Etonian . State-educated Mr Bercow made clear his view of the elite school when David Cameron became Conservative leader, saying, ‘Eton, hunting, shooting and lunch at White’s’ made him the wrong choice. The Clerk of the House has traditionally been a constitutional expert promoted from within the ranks of Westminster officials, but Mr Bercow is believed to want a new-style Commons Clerk. However, last night his friends said it was wrong to suggest  he favoured any candidate. A spokeswoman for the Speaker said the final decision would  be based on the candidates’ qualifications, abilities and their performances at interview, but she declined to give any  details on individual applicants, saying they  were ‘confidential’. She added: ‘The Speaker and the other members of the interview panel are keen to appoint the very best person for the job of Clerk.’","Carol Mills is one of two women on John Bercow's shortlist of three .

"By . Darren Boyle . An obsessive Star Trek fan has spent $500,000 transforming the basement of his home into a replica of the Starship Enterprise. Anthony Sforza, 48, from Long Island, New York, has been collecting memorabilia from the cult show since the 1980s. However, in 2010, Sforza decided to convert his basement into the interior of Captain Jean Luc Picard's space ship. Scroll down for video . Anthony Sforza, seated, spent more than $500,000 over three years converting the basement of his home into a replica of the Starship Enterprise, pictured alongside sons Michael and Daniel and wife Annette . Outside, the house looks like an ordinary family home similar to thousands of others on Long Island . But inside, the house has been transformed into a copy of the space ship captained by Jean Luc Picard . The father-of-two spent 1,500 hours over the past three years on the massive redesign. He said: 'It was very difficult at first to find materials that they used on the show. 'I tried to call them but getting an answer was impossible. 'Fortunately I was able to purchase a piece of the original set which I pulled apart to find out the exact paint and materials that were used - that's how I created the basement.' Sforza's two sons Michael and Daniel are impressed by their father's hard work. Sforza began collecting Star Trek memorabilia in the 1980s and spent 1,500 hours on the basement conversion . Among Sforza's proudest possessions is this transporter control unit which unfortunately does not work . Anthony Sforza even installed windows into his Starship allowing him to look out into deep space . Daniel, 7 said: 'I think that it's cool because he has all the belts and badges and everything is here to show just how much he loves Star Trek.' His 11-year-old son Michael, added: 'I would love to do something like this when I'm older - it would be pretty cool and I think it would be a good addition to any home.' But not everybody in the family is as enthusiastic about Sforza's unusual obsession. His sister Marion, 44, thinks his behaviour is a little odd. She said: 'Anthony's been obsessed with Star Trek for as long as I think I've been alive. 'I don't remember him ever not being obsessed with it, even when he was a little boy. 'I think he's a freak, but he loves it and he could be into worse things so if that's what makes him happy then that's great.' Sforza's wife, Annette, pictured, said she is incredibly proud of her husband for his sci-fi vision . Among Sforza's collection are several life sized models featuring characters from the hit TV show . In case of a visit by the Borg, Sforza has a display case with several phasers ready to repel boarders . Despite spending so much time constructing his spaceship interior - which is modelled on the NX-01 from the show's latest incarnation, Enterprise - Anthony still has the full support of his wife Annette, 46. She said: 'When Anthony first told me his vision for the basement I couldn't see it the way he did until he started building it. 'Once that started happening we all started getting very excited because we were seeing his vision come to fruition. 'I think it's wonderful, I admire him so much for being able to put vision into something like this and for it to look so incredible - it's wonderful and I'm so proud of him.'","Anthony Sforza spent $500,000 transforming his basement into a space ship .

"Updated: . 10:43 EST, 9 May 2012 . Archeologists who uncovered the first homosexual caveman have discovered the prehistoric village where he was 'the only gay' man. The male skeleton - believed to be nearly 6,000 years old - was found buried in the same way that Neolithic communities buried women, suggesting he was a different sexuality. Now the same team of experts have discovered what they believe was his home village near Prague in the Czech Republic. Czech archaeologists who uncovered what they believed was the world's first gay cavemen have located the village he belonged to nearby . The long houses found near the grave site are believed to have been the village where the 'gay' caveman lived . Dig director Radek Baly - from the Czech Archaeological Society - said: ¿We have managed to unearth impressions of wooden supporting structures of so-called long houses, typical of the Neolithic period.¿ . Y-M-C-Cave: The skeleton was found in a Prague suburb with its head pointing eastwards and surrounded by domestic jugs - rituals only previously seen in female graves. Men would normally be buried with weapons, hammers and flint knives . The Neolithic village near the grave site where the 'gay Stone Age man' Dig director Radek Baly - from the . Czech Archaeological Society - said: ‘We have managed to unearth . impressions of wooden supporting structures of so-called long houses, . typical of the Neolithic period.’ The skeleton was originally discovered . last year with a series of clues that led experts to believe the grave . belonged to a gay man. The . skeleton of the late Stone Age man, unearthed during excavations in the . Czech Republic, is said to date back to between 2900 and 2500 BC. During that period, men were . traditionally buried lying on their right side with the head pointing . towards the west; women on their left side with the head facing east. In . this case, the man was on his left side with his head facing west. Another clue is that men tended to be interred with weapons, hammers and . flint knives as well as several portions of food and drink to accompany . them to the other side. Women . would be buried with necklaces made from teeth, pets, and copper . earrings, as well as domestic jugs and an egg-shaped pot placed near the . feet. The ‘gay caveman’ was buried with household jugs, and no weapons. Archaeologists . do not think it was a mistake or coincidence given the importance . attached to funerals during the period, known as the Corded Ware era . because of the pottery it produced. From . history and ethnology, we know that people from this period took . funeral rites very seriously so it is highly unlikely that this . positioning was a mistake,’ said lead researcher Kamila Remisova . Vesinova. The skeleton was originally discovered last year with a series of clues that led experts to believe the grave belonged to a gay man . One of the artefact from archaeological site where the gay caveman was found - believed to date from the neolithic period . ‘Far more . likely is that he was a man with a different sexual orientation, . homosexual or transvestite. What we see here does not add up to . traditional Corded Ware cultural norms.’ An oval, egg-shaped container usually associated with female burials was also found at the feet of the skeleton. One of the domestic jugs among the caveman's remains. Normally only placed in female graves, the jugs suggest the caveman was either homosexual or transsexual . Another member of the . archaeological team, Katerina Semradova, said that colleagues had . uncovered an earlier case dating from the Mesolithic period where a . female warrior was buried as a man. She . added that Siberian shamans, or witch doctors, were also buried in this . way but with richer funeral accessories appropriate to their elevated . position in society. ‘This . later discovery was neither of those.

The high-school dropout came up with the brainchild while working as a skating equipment salesman from the back of his car almost a decade ago. But when he took his idea to UCLA’s Anderson School of Management a decade ago, recruiters were incensed to hear he hoped to use his time there to develop the . Crazy Cart.

'I told her, ""If you think your opinion of my . chances of being successful is going to stop my idea from being a . success, you have no idea who you’re sitting across the table from.""' Luckily, though, his outburst paid off and the recruiter was so impressed by his passion that she not only accepted him on the course but secured a $20,000 grant to develop the project over the summer between his first and second year. And as this 'ride guide' video shows, it has 360-degree steering and a drift bar for managing spins, drifts, and cornering.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . and Daily Mail Reporter . Nigel Farage was engulfed in a fresh controversy yesterday when he said the ban on owning handguns was ‘crackers’. The Ukip leader said his party would legalise and license firearms for ‘responsible’ owners who kept them locked up. But he was immediately criticised for the ‘stupid’ comments. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage faced tough questions during a radio phone-in, where he suggested that the ban on hand guns should be lifted . Mr Farage appeared uncomfortably and close to losing his temper when grilled about his manifesto and his comments about women being 'worth less' in the City . Most handguns were outlawed by the Tory Government after the Dunblane massacre in 1996. Labour went further in 1997 and banned all handguns, including .22 pistols used in the Olympics. Mr . Farage said: ‘I think the knee-jerk legislation that Tony Blair brought . in that meant the British Olympic pistol team have to go to France to . even practise, was just crackers. If you criminalise handguns then only . the criminals carry the guns.’ Peter Squires, professor of criminology at Brighton University, said Mr Farage’s comments were ‘irresponsible’. He added: ‘If public safety is a consideration then it’s a particularly stupid thing to say.’ Earlier . this week Mr Farage came under fire after Ukip councillor David . Silvester suggested the recent floods were linked to the legalisation of . gay marriage. The party . leader provoked further outrage by saying women who had children were . worth less to City firms. His bad week got worse when he was hit over . the head with a placard in Kent. Opponents said the remarks were a 'a green light for an increase in . criminality' and ignored the 'the depth of feeling that still exists on what happened that fateful day'. Mr . Farage was taking questions on a radio phone-in when he was bombarded . with questions about the extreme views of some of his elected . councillors and candidates. The . Ukip leader tried to laugh the questions off, insisting all of those . responsible for controversial comments used be members of the Tory . party. But he courted controversy himself with the suggestion on LBC 97.3 that handgun laws should be torn up. A . ban on owning most handguns was introduced by John Major’s government . in the wake of the Dunblane shooting, when Thomas Hamilton killed 16 . primary school children and a teacher before turning the gun on himself. It . was then extended by Tony Blair's Labour government in 1997 to cover . all handguns, including .22 pistols used in Olympic competitions. A listener, named only as John from County Durham, told Mr Farage he had never supported the ban, adding that ‘law abiding people who follow the law, are mature, should be able to get a licence to hold these sorts of guns’. Mr Farage insisted he did not want to . move to the ‘absolutely crazy’ system in the U.S. where ‘you can go and . buy automatic repeating rifles down at the local gun shop that looks . more like a supermarket'. Mr Farage added: ‘I think the knee jerk legislation that Blair brought in that . meant that the British Olympic pistol team have to go to France to even . practice, was just crackers. ‘And, if you criminalise handguns then only the criminals carry the guns. ‘And, . it’s really interesting that since Blair brought that piece of law in . gun crime doubled in the next five years in this country. ‘ . Mr . Farage added: ‘I think we need a proper gun licensing system which to a . large extent we already have and I think the ban on hand guns is . ludicrous.’ The ban on handguns was introduced in the wake of the Dunblane massacre when Thomas Hamilton murdered 16 five-year-old school children and their teacher Gwen Mayor before killing himself . Asked if Ukip’s . policy on gun control would be to allow handguns to be ‘kept in the . locked box and you’ve got your license’, he replied: ‘’Absolutely.’ Official . figures from the FBI in the U.S. show that there were 6,371 handgun . homicides in the in 2012, and the number has risen every year since . 2010. Should Britain allow people to keep handguns in their home, as UKIP leader Nigel Farage has suggested? Labour MP Keith . Vaz, who chairs the Commons home affairs committee, said: 'The logical . consequence of relaxing gun laws, as suggested by Mr Farage, is an . increase in gun use which should be discouraged rather than encouraged. Any change could possibly act as a green light for an increase in . criminality. 'Our . legislation makes Britain a beacon of safety and it would be completely . irresponsible to change the law governing hand guns.' Margaret Mitchell, Conservative . justice spokesman in the Scottish parliament, said: 'For Nigel Farage . to link such ill-advised comments with this tragic event is completely . inappropriate. 'What . happened in Dunblane is still fresh and raw in the memories of people . and someone like Nigel Farage should not be making these kind of . throwaway comments. 'Perhaps if he visited the town he would realise the depth of feeling that still exists on what happened that fateful day. 'When you have the leader of UKIP making remarks like this it’s no wonder the party’s views are largely ignored in Scotland.' Mr Farage denied having any idea what was in the Ukip manifesto in 2010, but he put his name to the foreword (above). Some of the more eye-catching policies in Ukip's 2010 manifesto include: . During the programme Mr Farage was repeatedly challenged on why his party attracts people with controversial views. He has spent all week fielding questions about Ukip councillor David Silvester, who suggested legalising gay marriage caused the recent storms which battered Britain. On Monday Mr Farage also gave a speech in the City, where he claimed mothers are ‘worth less’ to employers in the City than men. He suggested women who take time off to have children are paid less because they lose contact with their client base and struggle to succeed when they return to work. Hours later he was being clobbered over the head with a placard as he tried to enter push his way through an angry protest in Kent. And then yesterday he floundered during a BBC interview, when he was forced to disown the whole of his party’s 2010 manifesto, after being hit with a host of bizarre proposals he knew nothing about. Ukip promised to improve Britain by painting trains in traditional colours, deploying soldiers on the street and enforcing a dress code for taxi drivers and theatregoers. Despite standing on the manifesto as a candidate in the 2010 election, Mr Farage today dismissed it as ‘486 pages of drivel’. The MEP - who had briefly stood down as leader at the time to focus on an unsuccessful run for a Commons seat - insisted he had not even read the document. 'I didn't read it, it was drivel, 486 pages of drivel, I didn't read it, nor did the party leader, it was a nonsense, and we've put that behind us and moved onto a professional footing,' he said. 'We had a manifesto, and I'm going to put some inverted commas around it that was produced in 2010, it was basically a series of policy discussion papers that was put up on the website as a manifesto. 'It was 486 pages long, I'm pleased to say that the idiot that wrote it has now left us and joined the Conservatives, so there is some traffic going back the other way, and they're very welcome to him.' David Campbell Bannerman MEP was the main author of the manifesto, and is now a Tory. However, it later emerged that he had put his name to the foreword of the manifesto. The faltering performance came after the . Ukip leader, who worked in a brokerage firm before entering politics, . caused outrage this week by saying women who have children are 'worth less' to their employers when they return to work. He claimed the City was no longer sexist . as in the past, but said women who leave their client base to take ‘two . or three years off’ to have a baby, put themselves at a disadvantage. Pressed on the remarks today, he appeared to come close to losing his temper. He told LBC 97.3: 'Maybe what we should do is just lie, . maybe next time I get a question like this I’ll just lie, I’ll just do . what everybody else does, I’ll say something that isn’t true and there . will be no debate or argument about it. 'The fact is, you know, there . are now one million men who are bringing up families at home with the . women out working, so there are some changes happening in society. 'But, . overwhelmingly it’s the women that not only have the baby, but really . take the responsibility for bringing up the family, and there are some . super women who can do that and run a big career, but it’s not an easy . thing to do.'","Ban on handguns in the UK was introduced after 1996 Dunblane massacre .

"By . John Drayton . Giorgio Chiellini may have been furious with Luis Suarez after the Uruguay forward appeared to bite his shoulder on Tuesday, but the Italian defender can now see the funny side. The Juventus centre back was incensed when no action was taken by the referee as Italy were knocked out of the World Cup in Brazil. But he has now posted a picture of a hotel maid biting his shoulder in much the same way as Suarez while Brazil striker Fred was snapped pretending to bite team-mate Marcelo's arm in training. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Neymar watches Fred doing a 'Suarez' on Marcelo in Brazil training . Humour: Giorgio Chiellini is bitten on the shoulder by a hotel maid as he sees the funny side . Copycat: Fred pretends to bite Brazil team-mate Marcelo's arm in training . After the match, which Uruguay won 1-0, Chiellini said: ''It was ridiculous not to send Suarez off. 'It is clear, clear-cut and then there was the obvious dive afterwards because he knew very well that he did something that he shouldn’t have done. 'Suarez is a sneak and he gets away with it because FIFA want their stars to play in the World Cup. 'I'd love to see if they have the courage to use video evidence against him. The referee saw the bite mark too, but he did nothing about it.' Meanwhile, FIFA's disciplinary hearing into the incident will continue on Thursday morning, according to the head of the Uruguay Football Association. The independent disciplinary committee met until late into the night without coming to a verdict on the case of the Liverpool striker who has been charged with misconduct. Step 1: Suarez approaches Chiellini from behind during a Uruguay attack . Stage 2: The Liverpool striker moves his head close to Chiellini's shoulder as he prepares to attack . Stage 3: Suarez appears to clamp his jaws down and bite Chiellini's shoulder . VIDEO Suarez in another bite storm . Uruguay FA president Wilmar Valdez emerged from the Copacabana Palace hotel in Rio de Janeiro shortly after midnight local time to say the hearing would continue on Thursday. Valdez said: 'We know they met for a long time but we don't know if that means a good or a bad situation. They will continue in the morning.' Suarez's lawyer Alejandro Balbi, who is also a Uruguay FA board member travelled to Rio to defend the Liverpool striker and claimed there is a European campaign against him led by England and Italy. An outcome is expected well ahead of Uruguay's match with Italy on Saturday and Suarez's sponsors including adidas are keeping a close eye on the verdict. The video evidence appears damning and one senior FIFA official with experience of disciplinary cases, who asked to remain anonymous, believes the biting should be judged to be at least as serious as spitting, which carries a minimum six-game ban which would see Suarez's World Cup brought to an abrupt halt. However there are influential voices who are trying to bring pressure to bear for the player to be dealt with more leniently. According to Uruguay newspaper Subrayado, the most powerful figures in South American football gathered in the Copacabana Palace to try to secure a much less severe sanction. Shocking: Chiellini displays bite marks on his shoulder after the incident, but the referee wasn't swayed . These included Argentina's long-standing vice-president Julio Grondona who is second only to Sepp Blatter in the pecking order, the president of CONMEBOL Eugenio Figueredo and his predecessor, Nicolas Leoz, who are both Uruguayan. The independent disciplinary panel, chaired by Swiss lawyer Claudio Sulser, has a range of sanctions available up to 24-match ban or a two-year suspension from all football. A worldwide ban would impact on his playing for Liverpool but there is no precedent for such a sanction happening. It remains unclear whether Suarez's previous biting bans - 10 games for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic and seven matches for biting PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal - would be taken into consideration, but the panel do have that power if they wish. A FIFA spokeswoman said: 'They can take in all elements they deem necessary.' Suarez has not appeared in person at the disciplinary hearing. There are also reports that the Uruguay FA are claiming pictures of teeth-marks on Chiellini's shoulder were digitally altered.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Six U.S. men who have been imprisoned for weeks in Honduras after being arrested for violating weapons laws were working on a project to help local lobster divers. The crew from Aqua Quest International has been held at a prison in Puerto Lempira in the Central American country since May 5, when Honduran police and Navy personnel raided their newly arrived 65-foot vessel. The officers found a weapon on board, according to a news release from the shipwreck salvage and research company based in Tarpon Springs, Florida. Stephen Mayne, the brother of the company's president, Robert Mayne, who is one of those held, said: 'We initially thought it would be over as fast as it started because they broke no laws. Four of the six Americans - (l-r) Wayne Coley, Kelly Garrett, Devon Butler and Nick Cook - arrested in Honduras on suspicion of violating weapons charges stand inside the prison where they have been held since May 5 . 'Totally innocent': Michael Mayne is one of six U.S. men detained for weeks in Honduras on weapons charges while working on a project to aid local lobster divers . 'There's been a lot of work behind the scenes to secure their release and we thought it would be best to go through the proper channels. 'And after all this time, when it didn't seem to be going anywhere, we decided to take a different approach' by making a more public appeal, he told The Associated Press. The wife of one of the imprisoned men, Robert Mayne's brother, Michael, has dismissed the charges as 'phony', adding that her husband was 'totally innocent'. Barbara Mayne has also condemned the conditions inside the ramshackle jail where they are being held in Puerto Lempira. 'He said that the prison was like 100 degrees and it was hard to breathe at night and he was covered in bug bites,' she told Fox 25. She says she has 'total faith' the men will be released soon. Calls to Honduran prosecutors have gone unanswered and Honduran Navy officials declined to comment over the weekend. The company says it was working on a project with aid workers and officials the town of Ahuas to help local lobster divers, who can suffer permanent damage from dives as deep as 150 feet (45 metres). 'Ultimately the projects were going to provide some real opportunities, through flood abatement, for the local spiny lobster divers,' Mayne said. Hopeful: Mayne's wife Barbara says she has 'total faith' the Honduran authorities will release her husband . Ahuas is a Miskito Indian town in an impoverished Honduran region often exploited by drug traffickers. The area has been targeted by joint U.S.-Honduran anti-drug missions, though Stephen Mayne insisted none of the crew was involved in trafficking. Filmmaker Michael McCabe, who has been working with Aqua Quest and was on the boat at the time of the raid, said 'the complaint is just that they basically had weapons and didn't have permission.' The company acknowledged that the ship did have weapons aboard for protection at sea, but officials deny they failed to properly report them to port officials when they arrived. Ramshackle: The six men are reportedly being held in this prison in Puetro Lempira . The team were working on a project to clean up this river in the town of Ahuas to help local lobster divers . McCabe, who was allowed to leave Honduras, said he wasn't sure how many weapons were on board, but he believes there were fewer than six. 'The captain, off the Yucatan, has had to deal with people trying to board the boat. He's had experience with pirates. 'The only thing that will hold them off is if they see weapons,' he said by telephone from New York. In addition to Robert Mayne, those detained include Michael Mayne, Nick Cook, Devon Butler, Kelly Garrett and Steve Matanich. The company says on its website that in addition to salvage work, it carries out scientific investigation and documentation of sites.","Team arrested after Honduran police 'found weapon on board their vessel'

"By . Emma Innes . A grandmother has been awarded more than £20,000 in compensation after a botched tummy tuck operation caused her belly button to ‘explode’ on a plane. Patricia Jackson, 68, from Bridlington, Yorkshire, was flying home from a week’s holiday in Portugal when her belly button ‘erupted’. This caused foul smelling stomach contents to leak from her abdomen, causing other passengers to complain about the smell. Patricia Jackson, 68, had a botched tummy tuck after which her belly button 'exploded' on a plane . Mrs Jackson, the manager of a residential care home, decided to have a tummy tuck when she was 60 because she was unhappy with her appearance. She had lost weight but was self-conscious about the saggy skin and fat left on her stomach. As a result, she underwent surgery at a private hospital in 2005. During the operation, surgeons removed extra skin and fat as well as tightening the muscles in the abdominal wall. But, they did not create a new belly button for Mrs Jackson because she was told there was not enough material left over, which is a common occurrence in this type of surgery. However, they had left parts of the old one inside her. Mrs Jackson said: ‘For the first year after the operation, everything was fine and I went to work as normal. ‘However, . I was due for a yearly check-up and it was during this time that the . surgeon was concerned about the scarring because it looked quite bad. During the operation Mrs Jackson's belly button was left inside her where it started to break down (file picture) ‘It didn’t really bother me but he admitted me to hospital overnight.’ An ultrasound scan revealed an infection under the scar, which was treated with antibiotics. The wound was dressed and drained and Mrs Jackson was then discharged from hospital. After returning home, Mrs Jackson started to experience pain and an unexplained foul smelling discharge leaking from her abdomen, which made her feel embarrassed and self-conscious. Mrs Jackson became increasingly worried about the recurring leaking and was referred to several specialists. The . medical teams failed to determine the actual cause of the discharge . which was that her old belly button had been left inside her. Instead, doctors blamed the discharge on an infected stitch. The foul smelling contents of Mrs Jackson's stomach started to leak from her abdomen . In 2011, Mrs Jackson felt confident enough to go on holiday to Portugal. However, before she caught the return flight, she noticed that there were blisters around where her old belly button should have been. Once she . had boarded the plane, her belly button unexpectedly burst and the area . started to leak, causing the passenger next to her to complain about the . smell. Luckily, the air stewardess was able to help her to dress the wound as best she could. Despite the help from the on-board staff, Mrs Jackson says she felt tearful and embarrassed. She had to sit on the aisle seat and keep re-dressing the leaking wound in the toilets. Mrs Jackson had to have surgery to reconstruct her belly button (file picture) When the plane finally landed, she called her brother to take her immediately to Calderdale Royal Hospital in Halifax, where the wound was cleaned and dressed properly. No longer trusting her original surgeon, Mrs Jackson declined the offer of returning to the first hospital, instead choosing Castle Hill NHS Hospital in Hull. There, it was discovered that her old belly button was still inside her and this had broken down, causing the pain and leaking. After undergoing reconstructive surgery, Mrs Jackson was given a new belly button and now experiences no leaking problems. Mrs Jackson has now been awarded £22,500 in compensation from the surgeon who conducted the operation after the case was settled out of court. Jeanette Aspinall, head of medical negligence at Fletchers Solicitors, who helped with the case, said: ‘This case highlights how easy it is for an everyday cosmetic surgery procedure, like a tummy tuck, to go wrong, both with the surgery itself and if the proper after care is not administered. ‘Mrs Jackson had the operation to gain confidence, and instead was subjected to years of pain and embarrassment. ‘While Mrs Jackson is happy with the final result of the case after years of anger, she is now understandably fearful of undergoing any further surgery, should she need it in the future. ‘She is now keen to put this incident behind her and highlight to others the problems of not receiving the proper after care after cosmetic surgery.’ Mrs Jackson added: ‘I was angry when I first contacted Fletchers Solicitors because I felt that I had been neglected by The Hospital Group and the surgeon, and it wasn’t fair. ‘I was extremely pleased with the compensation – Fletchers Solicitors got me the amount that they could. ‘The result of my case means that awareness has been raised and it can hopefully change patient care in the future.’","Patricia Jackson, 68, had a tummy tuck in a private hospital in 2005 .

Scroll down for video . Maria Montanez-Colon, 58, (pictured left) was arrested after aggressively propositioning police officer Justin Davoult (right) at her Florida home . According to a police report from The Smoking Gun, Punta Gorda Police Department officer Justin Davoult was told by the inebriated 58-year-old: 'You are so sexy.' In the report Davoult, 31, stated: 'I asked her what I could help her with and she stated: ''You can f*** me.''' Officer Davoult said the woman tried to rub his chest and grab his arm. After the police officer left the home, the woman dialed 911 again and said that the officer had 'p***** her off'. Officer Davoult responded once again to the home with a police lieutenant as back-up. According to the report, Montanez-Colon told the officers that Davoult 'had been a perfect gentleman but when I asked him to f*** me, he turned me down so that made me angry'. When the officers asked the woman if she understood that she had misused the emergency call system, she answered: 'I do, but how else am I going to get you to f*** me?'

"Extremely rare photographs of World War I German fighter pilot The Red Baron have been found in a shoebox at a car boot sale. The photographs of Manfred von Richthofen flying his triplane in Germany almost 100 years ago were discovered completely by accident by a keen eyed photographer who stumbled across them while looking to buy garden tools. Barry Pickthall, 65, said he felt like he had 'hit the jackpot' when he saw what they were. Rare photographs of legendary World War I German fighter ace The Red Baron flying his plane have been discovered at a car boot sale. Manfred von Richthofen (right) with his brother Lothar . A signed picture of the ace, taken around 1916. Manfred von Richthofen, in the cockpit of an Albatros. His signature appears beneath the photo . The fighter ace became known as The Red Baron for his preference for red-painted aircrafts and emerged as a top pilot with 80 air combat victories. Mr Pickthall bought the historic photographs at the car boot sale in Ford Market near Littlehampton, West Sussex, for just £20 from a man who had just cleared his house. But it was not until he studied the negatives under a magnifying glass that he saw that all the pictures came with captions and realised how special the pictures were. Mr Pickthall, who owns the PPL Photo Agency in Walberton near Arundel, West Sussex, said he 'hit the jackpot' when he saw what they were. He said: 'The collection was in a shoebox and it came from a house clearance where the pictures had been stored away for many years. 'I'm always on the hunt and lookout for for old pictures, but on this occasion I had just popped to a local car boot sale to buy garden tools. 'I saw this shoebox and I picked it up because I was fascinated by the amount of negatives that were inside. 'I had no idea what they showed or who was in the pictures, I just took the gamble and it certainly paid off.' A seated portrait of Manfred von Richthofen in uniform.

Mr Pickthall, from Chichester, West Sussex, was thrilled and surprised when he realised who was in the pictures. He added: 'When I realised they were photographs of The Red Baron, I was delighted and extremely excited - it was like I had won the jackpot. 'He was the most famous flying ace of all time and he was definitely the most celebrated fighter pilots. 'Because I'm always looking for old pictures, I feel like a man with a metal detector, and this time it had felt like I had just found gold. 'The photographs are extremely rare and they must have been taken by somebody in the German Air Force. Sopwith triplane single seater scout. Pilots nicknamed it the Tripehound or simply the Tripe.

"By . Alexandra Williams . Michael Schumacher has recovered from the pneumonia he picked up while lying in a coma in a French hospital, a German newspaper has reported. The seven-times Formula One champion had already overcome the pneumonia by the time reports of his condition emerged earlier this week, according to daily tabloid Bild. The news comes as Schumacher's family released a statement saying they 'strongly believe' the 45-year-old will recover from the December 29 skiing accident which has left him fighting for his life. Scroll down for video . Positive: The family of stricken former Formula One champion Michael Schumacher, pictured here with his wife Corrina, 'strongly believe' he will recover from a skiing accident which has left him fighting for his life . Visitors: Corinna Schumacher and French professor Gerard Saillant arrive at Grenoble University Hospital in France to visit the former Formula One champion . In the statement, Schumacher's family said the most important element of his recovery was not speed, rather that it progresses in a 'continuous and controlled way'. The statement said: 'Michael's family would like to again express their sincere thanks for the continuous sympathy coming from all over the world. The good wishes they receive help the family and we are convinced they also help Michael, who still is in a waking up process.' 'As often in such situation, no day is like the next. The family is thankful for ones understanding that they would not wish to disclose medical details in order to protect Michael’s privacy. 'As assured from the beginning we will continue to communicate any decisive new information on Michael’s health state. We are aware that the wake up phase can take a long time. 'The family continues to strongly believe in Michael's recovery and place all their trust in the doctors, nurses and nursing auxiliaries team. 'The important thing is not the speed of the recovery but that Michael’s healing process progresses in a continuous and controlled way."" Schumacher's accident occurred on December 29 in the French ski resort of Meribel, where he owns a chalet. He had been skiing on the piste with . his son and family friends but shortly after 11am moved to a patch of . rocky off-piste located between two runs. He skied into a rock and then catapulted on to another banging his head with such force that his helmet split in two. He was wearing a helmet camera at the time and the entire accident was recorded. Devoted: Michael Schumacher has been at University Hospital in Grenoble since December. Above, Schumacher is pictured with his wife Corinna in Italy . Schumacher, the seven-times Formula 1 champion, is being kept under constant scrutiny to detect any movement at all . Investigators said it was a freak accident and Schumacher, who is a very competent skier, was not skiing at an excessive speed. He was airlifted off the mountain and taken to Grenoble University Hospital where doctors put him into a medically-induced coma. A scan revealed he had suffered serious brain damage. His manager released a statement later that night saying the sportsman was fighting for his life. Surgeons performed two operations to relieve pressure on his brain and remove blood clots in the days following his accident. Wife Corinna, 44, with whom the champion has two children Gina Marie, 16, and Mick, 14, has remained at his bedside. His manager this week refused to comment on German media reports that he had contracted a lung infection. Pneumonia is among the greatest life-threatening conditions that can afflict people in Schumacher's position. The lack of a competent swallowing mechanism can make saliva run into the lungs and trigger the potentially lethal respiratory infection. Treatment: Schumacher is currently being kept under anaesthetic at the University Hospital (above) in France . Andreas Pingel, medical director of the Centre for Spine Surgery and Neuro-Traumatology at the BG Hospital in Frankfurt told Germany's Focus Magazine only last week: 'About 30 to 50 per cent of all patients who lie in a coma as long as Michael Schumacher has, get it.' He receives food through a tube to his stomach, oxygen via a hose from a machine next to his bed as he still cannot breathe independently. Three times daily his joints and muscles are massaged to prevent atrophy and bed sores. The coma suppressed his swallowing reflex, pain perception and his respiratory drive. He has to be acutely monitored around the clock during this wake-up phase to see if such things are returning naturally - if at all. His blood is also thinned to prevent thrombosis and he is regularly turned and even stood straight up at times to keep blood flowing. He lies on a special air-filled mattress to prevent pressure sores and his urinary tract is under constant vigilance because of the danger of waste bacteria entering the bloodstream and causing another potentially fatal infection.","German newspaper says Schumacher has already beaten the lung condition .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Heavenly match: Ressurrection and Deven met at a Washington, DC-area homeless shelter when they were both down on their luck in 2011. They've since married and even started their own non-profit organization geared toward helping the needy . A Washington, DC-area couple who met while they were both living at a homeless shelter in 2011 have since become blissfully married and are now telling their heartwarming tale. Ressurrection Graves was a struggling entrepreneur who lost her business, home and relationship at the same time. She says she prayed to God, who told her to go to a specific area homeless shelter. That's where she met Deven, a veteran struggling to figure out the world after leaving the service. Their irrefutable chemistry led to a first date and an engagement five months later. While the road was mostly smooth . toward their eventual nuptials, not everything was peachy in the . beginning for Ressurrection and Deven. 'It . was a stormy night when Ressurrection came into the homeless shelter,' Deven reminisced to the Huffington Post. 'I asked her name, and she . asked why I needed to know that information.' After she selflessly helped him spruce up his resume, Deven took Ressurrection out to an area McDonald's. Deven remembers the first shared meal fondly. 'She picked me up and we went to McDonalds to use some coupons that were given to me. I still remember what she ordered -- a fish sandwich, no tartar sauce, fries and orange juice,' he said. Ressurrection isn't as nostalgiac. 'I hate McDonalds,' she laughed. 'But he had a coupon.' Despite her initial reluctance, Graves eventually gave in to the feelings she was having for Deven. Fortunate: Ressurrection (right) and Deven (left) met in a homeless shelter and are now blissfully married Ressurrection says after she lost her home, God directed her to a specific Virginia homeless shelter where she met the love of her life .

'We talked for several weeks,' said . Graves. 'I was thinking about being with him, but there was a lot I . needed to figure out first, . 'He . approached me one day and said, ""I want to be more than friends,""' Graves went on. 'It wasn't a line. I told him that I could be his gift . when he left the shelter. We left together a week or so later.' Five . months later, Graves heard of a housing opportunity for her and . daughter, but for her new love to join them they needed to be married. So they started to plan a wedding. And on August 28, 2013, they tied the knot in honor of their made-in-heaven match and also the anniversary of Martin Luther King's I Have a Dream speech. The wedding theme was 'I Had a Dream, and It Came True.' Since then, the couple have made a point of giving back to the community. They even began right after their I Dos when they struck out to area parks and handed food out to the needy. They've also started an organization called Glory Soldiers Global that seeks to help eradicate poverty and prevent child sexual abuse. Now the happy couple lives in the Washington, DC area and run a non-profit dedicated to helping eradicate homelessness and helping people who are victims of childhood sexual abuse .","Ressurrection Graves was a down-on-her-luck entrepreneur when she says God told her to make her way to a Virginia homeless shelter .

Kevin Waldrum from Loughborough who has been charged more than £91,000 by Vodafone for calling adult entertainment services . The . 45-year-old called the daytime chat line, which charges premium rates, after . seeing an advert on television, and claims he was unaware of the mounting cost . of his calls, which he made between September and November last year. ‘I . was flicking through the daytime TV channels and I saw the advert,' said Mr Waldrum. ‘I just wanted to see what is was all about. ‘You . ring up and there's all these options, they ask your name and sympathise with . you' he said. Mr Waldrum holding a letter from Vodafone regarding his bill, which the company have reduced by over half as a gesture of goodwill . Mr . Waldrum, who is currently unemployed, said that he felt able to speak to the . girls about his heartache and that he had a special bond with one girl, . ‘Hannah’ who he spoke to on a regular basis. ‘I . was telling this girl Hannah about my previous relationship and how it had . ended 18 months before and she told me that she was having problems with her . boyfriend and it was all going wrong. ‘Her . and the other girls had a nickname for me, I was so well-known there. ‘When . I called up they used to say 'Loughborough Kev is on the phone'.’ Kevin says he had a special bond with the women premium rate chat line (posed by model) Despite . an initial bill of £19,333.63 from his phone provider Vodafone, Mr Waldrum . continued to make regular calls to the chat line. He . says he felt unable to stop: ‘I was back calling them pretty much right away . ‘They . used to warn you when a call was coming to the end of the 20 minutes you were . allowed, and then I'd just phone straight back. These . calls resulted in a second bill of £71,850.67, which prompted Mr Waldrum to . complain to Vodafone. ‘The . Vodafone need shutting down because they're ripping people off left, right and . centre,’ he said. ‘I'm . not putting all the blame on them but not even multi-millionaires would want to . spend this much on a phone bill, surely, so why I have been allowed to go up to £91,000. ‘I . admit I rang these numbers and it's partly my own fault but the line should . have gone dead before I started to incur such high charges. ‘They . must be taking millions from poor people like me. ‘It . has absolutely screwed my head up. ‘I am . so down, depressed, desperate and anxious over the whole situation. ‘All . I can think about from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed is, how . am I going to pay these bills? Mr . Waldrum says the stress of  the bill . forced him to visit his doctor, who put him on medication to control his . stress. He now takes Diazepam for his anxiety and . Nitrazepam to help him sleep. Mr Waldrum began calling the premium rate chatlines after splitting from his girlfriend of two years . But . he said he will not be able to move on with his life until the situation is . settled. He . said: 'I called Vodafone and they said they were going to investigate but . I haven't heard anything since. ‘It's . been about six months of pure worry since then. ‘I've . been totally traumatised by it. I have realised now, I just think 'Why did I . ever do that?' I have deep regrets over it now. ‘Every . time I see a Vodafone shop I start to feel physically sick and get a migraine . and it makes me shake. ‘I . want people to be aware how it can destroy lives. They have ruined my life.’ Kevin intends to continue to fight paying the remainder of his phone bill, which he says has ruined his life . Vodafone . argue that they barred Mr Waldrum’s mobile phone for high charges but he . ordered a replacement SIM from a shop to allow him to carry on calling the . premium lines. However . Vodafone admitted they had missed an opportunity to alert Mr Waldrum to the higher . costs at an earlier stage and following an investigation Vodafone has cut his . bill to £29,083. A . spokesman for Vodafone said: 'By his own admission, Mr Waldrum made calls . to premium rate adult entertainment services more or less continuously over a . period of two months until we suspended the services on October 21 when the . total debt was £91,000. ‘We . had previously barred a phone used by Mr Waldrum on September 11 for high usage . but he got round this by requesting a replacement SIM card from a retail store, . saying he had lost the original. ‘He . was then able to continue to build up debt. ‘We . cannot manage our customers' spending for them, but we will try to alert them . to it if we are aware of an unusual high spending pattern. ‘Looking . back at the records, we can see that we could have alerted Mr Waldrum on . September 18. ‘It . can sometimes take several days for billing to register on our system, and by . this time, his extreme use of premium rate services meant his bill was already £29,083. Since . we missed the opportunity to alert him at this stage, we will waive the charges . of around £61,000 incurred after this point as a gesture of goodwill. Mr . Waldrum remains liable for charges of £29,083.’ Kevin . has said he will continue to fight against being held liable for the remaining . amount - calling the offer 'rubbish'. He . said: ‘They should drop the whole lot. They have to think about my health. ‘This . is not about money anymore, it is about respecting people. ‘They . haven't even called me to tell me that the charges were being reduced.’","Kevin Waldrum, 45, ran up £91,184 phone bill calling adult chat lines .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Matthew Blake . The price of your morning latte, espresso or skinny caramel macchiato with an extra shot could be about to soar due to a killer fungus that is ravaging coffee harvests across Latin America. Coffee rust, or roya, is a yellow and orange-colored fungus that has devastated coffee fields from Mexico to Peru over the past two years, causing more than $1 billion in damage across the region. Its damage has become so severe that the U.S. government has launched a $5million drive to help farmers in the worst-hit regions in a desperate bid to save the industry and keep coffee cheap. But aside from fears over the cost of a cappuccino on the American high street, the real concern is for the thousands of small, family-run farms whose livelihoods hang in the balance after watching entire crops be devoured by the disease. Scroll down for video . Coffee picker: Coffee rust, or roya, is a yellow and orange-colored fungus that has ravaged coffee harvests from Mexico to Peru over the past two years, causing more than $1 billion in damage across Latin America . Long journey: Arabica coffee beans begin as reddish berry-like seeds (left) on small farms in Central America, long before they end up as cappuccinos on Western high streets (right) Especially hard hit have been Central America's arabica coffee plants, which produce high-quality beans used in espressos and gourmet specialty blends that are in growing demand in the United States and elsewhere around the world. Prices for arabica coffee jumped to a two-year high in the futures market earlier this month, thanks in part to a severe drought in Brazil. 'We are concerned because we know coffee rust is already causing massive amounts of devastation,' said Raj Shah, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development. On Monday, he was expected to announce a $5 million partnership with Texas A&M University's World Coffee Research center to try to eliminate the fungus. Aside from fears for the price of a cappuccino on the American high street, . expert's chief concern is for the economic security of the mostly . small, family-run farms in South America. If farmers lose their jobs, it . increases hunger and poverty in the region and contributes to violence . and drug trafficking. Washington . estimates that production could drop anywhere from 15 to 40 per cent in . coming years, and that those losses could mean as many as 500,000 . people could lose their jobs. Hard hit: Especially hard hit have been Central America's arabica coffee plants, which produce high-quality beans used in espressos and gourmet specialty blends that are in growing demand across the world . Fears: Aside from fears for the price of a cappuccino on the American high street, experts' chief concern is for the economic security of the mostly small, family-run farms in South America . Though some countries have brought the fungus under control, many of the poorer coffee-producing countries in Latin America don't see the rust problem getting better anytime soon. Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama and Costa Rica have all been hard hit. Much . of the blander, mass-produced coffee in this country comes from Asia . and other regions. Most of the richer, more expensive coffees are from . small, high altitude farms in Central America. Because the farms are . smaller, farmers there often don't have enough money to buy the . fungicides needed or lack the training to plant in ways that could avoid . contamination. Job fears: Washington estimates that production could drop anywhere from 15 to 40 per cent in coming years, and that those losses could mean as many as 500,000 people could lose their jobs . The rust, called roya in Spanish, is a fungus that is highly contagious due to airborne fungal spores. It affects different varieties, but the Arabica beans are especially susceptible. Rainy weather worsens the problem. 'We don't see an end in sight anytime soon,' said Leonardo Lombardini of Texas A&M's World Coffee Research. So far, major U.S. coffee companies have been able to find enough supply to avoid price increases. But some smaller outfits already have seen higher prices, said Ric Rhinehart of the Specialty Coffee Association of America. Rhinehart said the worst-case scenario is that consumers eventually will pay 'extraordinarily high prices for those coffees, if you can find them at all.' He said some very specialized varieties from a single origin - Guatemalan antigua coffees, for example - have been much harder to source. If the problem continues, he says, some small coffee companies either will raise prices or use blends that are easier to find, decreasing the quality of the coffee. Larger companies such as Starbucks and Keurig Green Mountain Inc. have multiple suppliers across the region and say they have so far been able to source enough coffee. 'It's a little bit too soon to tell what the impact will be on supply and long term quality over time,' said Lindsey Bolger, who heads up coffee sourcing for Keurig Green Mountain. Still, the companies are trying to ensure that their future supply isn't affected, so they are working closely with growers on better practices that will help them avoid contamination. How much? Larger companies such as Starbucks and Keurig Green Mountain Inc. have multiple suppliers across the region and say they have so far been able to source enough coffee . 'Supporting the farmer's ability to access information, technology and resources allows them to adapt to these uncertainties and ensures the longevity of our industry's supply chain,' said Craig Russell, Starbucks Global Coffee executive vice president. Starbucks even bought a Costa Rican farm for research purposes. USAID intends to work with Texas A&M to step up research on rust-resistant coffee varieties and help Latin America better monitor and respond to the fungus. The U.S. already collaborates with some of the coffee companies and other international organizations to finance replanting of different varieties of trees. The effort is part of the Obama administration's Feed the Future program, which aims to rid the world of extreme poverty through agricultural development and improved nutrition. While the effort has helped hungry children around the globe, 'we're at risk of backtracking because of coffee rust,' Shah says.","Coffee rust, or roya, has ravaged coffee harvests across Central America .

"By . Leon Watson . South . Korean President Park Geun-hye tearfully apologised today for a ferry . disaster that killed about 300 passengers and . said she would break up the coastguard for failing in its duties. Park . has been hit hard by an angry nationwide outcry over the government's . response to South Korea's worst civilian maritime disaster in 20 years . and the seemingly slow and ineffective rescue operation. Polls show support for Park has dropped by more than 20 points since the April 16 disaster. Scroll down for video . South Korean President Park Geun-hye prays during a serves to pay tribute to victims of the sunken ferry Sewol at a Catholic church in Seoul . 'I . apologise to the nation for the pain and suffering that everyone felt, . as the president who should have been responsible for the safety and . lives of the people,' Park said in a televised national address, her . first since the Sewol capsized and sank with 476 passengers and crew on . board. She fought back sobs . as she remembered some of the teenagers who perished trying to help one . another, calling them heroes in an unprecedented show of emotion. Park, . who is serving a single five-year term, is the daughter of Park . Chung-hee, the former military strongman who ruled for nearly two . decades in the 1960s and 1970s. She lost both her parents to assassins. At least 286 people were killed and 18 remain missing. Only 172 people were rescued, with the rest presumed to have drowned. Of the passengers, 339 were children and their teachers on a field trip from a high school on the outskirts of Seoul. Park . vowed sweeping reforms to improve oversight, as well as tough . punishment for bureaucrats and businesses whose negligence endangers . public safety. Investigators believe that the Sewol ferry, pictured, capsized last month as the ship was carrying excess cargo . 'A . 20-year-old vessel was bought and refurbished to add excessive capacity, . then it was loaded with much more cargo than allowed with a false . reporting on weight, but not a single person in the position to . supervise stopped any of it,' Park said. She . singled out structural problems within the coast guard as the main . reason why there was such a high casualty toll from an accident that . played out on national television as the vessel gradually sank with most . of the passengers trapped inside. 'Had . there been an immediate and proactive rescue operation after the . accident, we would have been able to reduce the casualties,' Park said. The . coast guard's rescue duties would be transferred to a national . emergency safety agency to be set up and the national police will take . over its investigative function, she said. Relatives holding portraits of their children who perished when the Sewol ferry sank with the loss of around 300 lives stage a sit-in protest demanding to see South Korean President Park Geun-Hye in Seoul . A protestor puts up yellow origami boats on the side of a police vehicle while relatives with children who perished when the Sewol ferry sank . Some . of the crew, including the captain, were caught on videotape abandoning . ship while the children were repeatedly told to stay put in their . cabins and await further orders. Park . has apologised in person to many family members of the victims but her . administration has faced continued criticism and nationwide anger for . its handling of the disaster. Park's . public support has dropped to 46 percent, from 70 percent before the . accident, according to a recent poll. Her formal apology and the . blueprint for bureaucratic reform have been criticised for coming too . late, while her decision to break up the coast guard has also been . questioned. Abandon ship: Apparently wearing no trousers, Lee Joon-seok, 68, is seen clambering over the heavily-listing vessel's rails as he is helped onto a lifeboat while the ferry is still above water . Saving himself: He is then helped onto a life raft leaving hundreds of passengers behind . Lee Joon-Seok (centre), captain of South Korean ferry Sewol which sank at sea off Jindo, is seen as he is sent to a prosecutor's office in Mokpo, South Korea . Arrest: Lee Joon-seok, centre, was pictured being led towards a court in Mokpo, south of Seoul, following his arrest . 'Although we . need to integrate government functions on safety and disaster . management, dissolving the coast guard all of sudden can make more . problems that may be difficult to fix,' said Professor Lee Jun-han of . Incheon National University. Park . said the coast guard had not only failed in its search and rescue duty . but that, in its current form, it would be unable to prevent another . large-scale disaster. 'The . coast guard continued to get bigger in size but did not have enough . personnel and budget allocated for maritime safety, and training for . rescue was very much insufficient,' she said. All . 15 surviving crew members were indicted last week, including the . captain and three senior crew members on homicide charges. The remaining . 11 crew were indicted for negligence. The . prosecution says the ferry was structurally defective after a . remodelling to add capacity and was massively overloaded with cargo. A . sharp turn then caused it to list and capsize. The Sewol had been on a supposedly routine journey from the mainland port of Incheon south to the holiday island of Jeju.

"By . Matthew Blake . The victims of a Russian helicopter crash that killed 12 in an Arctic lake were preparing a fishing trip for president Vladimir Putin, it has been reported. The Mi-8 helicopter broke into three . pieces after smashing into the Munozera lake in the northwestern . Murmansk region in bad weather on Saturday evening, emergency officials . said. And today, an unidentified regional official told local Flash Nord news agency that the expedition was preparing a fishing trip for Putin, who had been expected to arrive in Murmansk 'in the coming days'. The report could not be independently confirmed. Sinking: The Mi-8 helicopter carrying 17 passengers and crew including top regional officials and businessmen, came down into the Munozero lake in the far northern Murmansk region on Saturday. Two survived the crash . Icy depths: Investigators said that possible causes of the crash were aircraft malfunction and bad weather conditions . Putin is known to enjoy recreational fishing in the Arctic, and told the U.S. Outdoor Life magazine in 2011 that some of the 'best fishing in the world' was in the Murmansk region. He has repeatedly posed for photographs with a rod in his hand and has, on more than one occasion, done so without a shirt on in a series of topless displays of manhood for which he has become known. The helicopter belonged to the . fertilizer producer Apatit, whose top executives were onboard along with . regional government officials, according to the parent company, . PhosAgro. The company published a list of 13 passengers and five crew . members believed to have been on the flight. Reacting to today's report, however, PhosAgro general director Andrei Guryev . said in a statement that the purpose of the trip was not a recce ahead of Putin's visit but to look at the . potential for developing tourism in the Murmansk region and to . familiarize officials with the tourism infrastructure owned by Apatit. Macho man: Putin is known to enjoy recreational fishing in the Arctic, and has repeatedly posed for photographs with a rod in his hand often without wearing a shirt in one of his topless displays of manhood for which he has become known . Two passengers survived the crash while three more remain missing. The cause of the crash was still under investigation, but was most likely due either to technical failure or the pilot’s inability to handle difficult weather conditions, the spokesman for the federal Investigative Committee, Vladimir Markin, said in a statement. 'There were 17 people on board. The bodies of 12 dead have been raised to the surface, the fate of three people remains unknown,' the head of the emergency ministry's national crisis management centre, Viktor Yatsutsenko, was quoted as saying by the ITAR-TASS news agency. The two survivors were in a 'satisfactory condition' in hospital after being found floating in the lake still strapped to their chairs, Yatsutsenko said. Ten out of the 12 dead have been identified, including the deputy governor of the Murmansk region, Sergei Skomorokhov, the RIA Novosti news agency reported, citing a law enforcement source. Searching: Three people are still missing as hope of finding survivors began to fade . The search for the missing was hampered by poor weather conditions with high winds and waves, rescuers told RIA Novosti. The number of people on board was initially reported as 18, but fell to 17 as it emerged that one crew member did not board the helicopter. 'According to updated data, one of the crew members, a technician... did not fly,' a source from law enforcement told ITAR-TASS. Investigators said that possible causes of the crash were aircraft malfunction and bad weather conditions. 'The pilot found himself in difficult meteorological conditions, lost his sense of direction and hit the surface of the water,' the Investigative Committee said in a statement. PhosAgro, one of the world's top producers of phosphate fertilizers, said that the trip was organized by one of its subsidiaries to help regional authorities to develop the region's tourism potential and attract investors.","Mi-8 helicopter brokecrashed into the Munozera lake in .

"By . Leon Watson . Bosnia said today that more than a quarter of its four million people had been affected by the worst floods to hit the Balkans in living memory. Comparing the 'terrifying' destruction to that of the country's 1992-95 war, authorities said the extent of the devastation became apparent in neighbouring Serbia too. As waters receded in some of the worst-hit areas it was revealed that homes had been toppled or submerged in mud, trees felled and villages strewn with the rotting corpses of livestock. Scroll down for videos . A man reacts near a house tilted by floods in the village of Krupanj, west from Belgrade . Houses and agricultural lands are affected negatively due to the heavy rainfall in Obrenovac, Serbia . At least 35 people drowned after heavy rainfall since Thursday triggered floods in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia, officials said . The regional death toll reached at least 39, after the heaviest rainfall since records began 120 years ago caused rivers to burst their banks and triggered hundreds of landslides. 'The consequences ... are terrifying,' Bosnian Foreign Minister Zlatko Lagumdzija told a news conference. 'The physical destruction is not less than the destruction caused by the war.' Lagumdzija said more than 100,000 houses and other buildings in Bosnia were no longer fit to use and that over a million people had been cut off from clean water supplies. 'During the war, many people lost everything,' he said. 'Today, again they have nothing.' His remarks threw into sharp relief the extent of the challenge now facing the cash-strapped governments of both Bosnia and Serbia. Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic said the cost in Serbia would run to hundreds of millions of euros, and that the death toll would certainly rise.

Macedonia sends aid to flood-hit Bosnia and Herzegovina as the countries struggle to cope in the aftermath of floods which have left at least 35 people dead . Tens of thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes across the Balkan Peninsula in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina . Even as the crisis eased in some areas, a new flood wave from the swollen River Sava threatened others, notably Serbia's largest power plant, the Nikola Tesla complex, 30 km (18 miles) southwest of the capital Belgrade. In Bosnia, one official said as many as 500,000 people had been evacuated or left their homes, the kind of human displacement not seen since more than a million were driven out by ethnic cleansing in the Bosnian war two decades ago. At least 25,000 people have been evacuated in Serbia, but many more are believed to have left of their own accord.

'We have some indications that a half a million Bosnians have either been evacuated or have left their homes because of flooding or landslides,' said Fahrudin Solak, the acting head of the civil defence service in Bosnia's autonomous Federation. Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic said the floods were of an 'epic, Biblical' scale. 'It has not been remembered in the last 150 years that we have had such a natural disaster,' he told Sky News. 'Our . country depends on agriculture. There are many people who lost all . their natural goods, an everything that was the mainstay of their . income.'

Soldiers and energy workers toiled through the night to build barriers of sandbags to keep the water back from the Nikola Tesla energy complex and from the coal-fired Kostolac power plant, east of Belgrade. Djina Trisovic, a union spokeswoman at Serbia's EPS power utility, said some workers at the Nikola Tesla plant had worked three days with barely a break because relief teams could not reach the plant. 'The plant should be safe now,' she told Reuters. 'We've done all we could. Now it's in the hands of God.' The plant provides roughly half of Serbia's electricity. Parts of it had already been shut down as a precaution, but it would have to be powered down completely if the waters breached the defences. Flooding had already caused considerable damage, estimated by the government at over 100 million euros ($140 million), to the Kolubara coal mine that supplies the plant. Authorities in Bosnia issued a fresh warning about the danger of landmines left over from the war and now dislodged by the flooding. In the north Bosnian region of Maglaj, barely a single house was left untouched by the waters, which receded to leave a tide of mud and debris. In the village of Donja Polja, where Muslim Bosniaks returned in 1995 to homes burned or shelled during the war, Hatidza Muhic swept the mud from the hallway of her house. Dark lines on the walls indicated the water had reached some three metres high. 'I thought the war was as bad as it can get, but it can get worse,' Muhic said. 'I just pray to God that we can save our minds, because first we were hit by the war, and now this.'","A state of emergency has been declared in Bosnia and Herzegovina .

"By . Associated Press . and Alex Greig . Weather officials in Albuquerque say a mysterious presence that showed up on its radar the last few nights has turned out to be of the insect variety. A mysterious green formation showed up on the National Weather Service's radar that looked to be rain. It was no storm, but a swarm of grasshoppers over Albuquerque's West Mesa for the fourth night in a row on Friday. Insect swarm: The grasshoppers showed up as a green cloud on radars, prompting technicians to check they were still functioning in the absence of any rain . Meteorologist Chuck Jones says the swarm got caught up in winds heading southwest and is being carried as high as 1,000 feet, well above the height of the city's tallest buildings. Jones says the grasshoppers likely hatched weeks ago and are now grown, leading to their ability to trigger radar images. Officials say last year's monsoon season and a drier winter created the ideal environment for the grasshoppers to hatch. There wasn't enough rain to kill the eggs so they all hatched, creating the worst infestation in 20 years. Infestation: A garage door is covered in the insects, which hatched in record numbers because of a dry winter . Biblical proportions: Albuquerque residents will have to put up with the bugs until they move on . Technicians initially thought their equipment was malfunctioning when they saw several unexplained clusters. 'We really thought that our radar was broke,' Brent Wachter, a forecaster from the National Weather Service told ABC News. 'So we sent our technicians out there a couple of times and we couldn't find anything wrong so we had to call the National Radar Depot in Oklahoma.' Some citizens want the state to spray insecticides for the insects, but John R. Garlisch, extension agent at Bernalillo County Cooperative Extension Service says it will be ineffective. 'It is a nuisance to people because they fly into people’s faces while walking, running, and biking. They are hopping into people’s homes and garages, they splatter the windshield and car grill while driving, and they will eat people’s plants,'  Garlisch told ABC News, but that 'this, too, shall pass.'","Weather officials were baffled by a green cloud that showed up on radars in Albuquerque .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Chinese authorities have been accused of an anti-Christian crackdown after ripping down a church in 'the Jerusalem of the East'. The nation's Communist party keeps a tight grip on religion, fearing challenges to its authority, but allows worship at state-controlled churches. Thousands of protesters have spent weeks as a human shield around the Protestant Sanjiang church in Wenzhou, south east China, after officials claimed it was four times the permitted size. Ripped down: Four bulldozers started demolishing Sanjiang church in Wenzhou after weeks of protests . Last week, the church's leaders reportedly struck a deal with the government to save the building, completed in 2013. But today four excavators were sent to demolish the symbolic landmark. It is one of 10 planned demolitions in the region, which has become a stronghold for the marginalised religion. Christians blasted the move as a 'barbaric campaign' by Communist leaders to suppress their culture. Churchgoers accused the Communist party of trying to quash Christianity, with 10 more demolitions planned . Controversy: State media claims the landmark was approved but it was built four times the permitted size . Bob Fu, a US-based Christian activist, told The Telegraph: 'This government-orchestrated barbaric forced demolition represents a serious escalation against religious freedom in Zhejiang. 'The Chinese regime chooses to disregard its own laws and the will of its best citizens.' Officials rubbished the claims, stating the church violates building restrictions. According to the China Aid Association (CAA), the local government had agreed to only demolish two storeys of an accessory building, not the main structure, but the deal fell through today.","Four bulldozers ripped down Sanjiang Church in Wenzhou, east China .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Britons have been urged to stay vigilant after it emerged that a dog had passed TB on to a child in the first ever recorded case in the country. The youngster, who was under 10, was infected with bovine tuberculosis after catching it from their family pet in Gloucestershire last year. It comes just days after nine cats were revealed to have been infected by the killer disease in an outbreak feared to have been caused by badgers. Case: A child was infected with TB after catching it from their pet dog in Gloucestershire last year (file image) Two people from the same household were treated for TB after they contracted the disease from their kitten, while two other adults were infected with a dormant form of the bug. The child who was infected by a dog was diagnosed with symptom-free 'latent' TB after health officials discovered the pet was infected. The youngster later made a full recovery, but the diseased pet was destroyed by vets. Now, experts have warned pet owners to stay vigilant, confirming that both dogs and cats are capable of passing on the deadly disease. 'There has been a recent human case of a child catching TB from an infected dog they were living with,' animal health expert, Professor Danielle Gunn-Moore, told The Sun. 'The child is better now.' Meanwhile, a spokesman for Public Health England said the youngster's entire family had been screened as a 'precautionary measure'. On Thursday, the Daily Mail revealed nine cats were infected with TB in the Home Counties in a matter of weeks. Six were put down or have died, two have survived, but one, an 18-month-old tabby called Milhouse, has run away.

Jessica Livings, 19, was among those infected by TB after reportedly catching the disease from her pet kitten as she cleaned a wound on its body. How the story was reported in Thursday's Daily Mail . The teenager was struck down with pneumonia and had to have emergency . surgery, before being later rushed back to hospital for further treatment for severe lung damage. ‘I lost a stone and half in five weeks, I was very ill and had fevers, . cold sweats and hallucinations. I didn’t realise what was real and what . wasn’t,' Miss Livings said on Thursday. The teenager was diagnosed with the disease in October after a vet raised concerns about an outbreak among cats in the Newbury area of Berkshire. She is now categorised as being at no risk of passing on TB despite her emergency readmission to the Royal Berkshire Hospital last month. However, her kitten later died from the illness. It is rare for cats to contract TB, with about 25 cases each year in Britain. The nine infected cats all lived within three miles of each other –  and six within a 250-yard radius.

Dubbed the ‘M-Plan’, the new diet based on mushrooms promises to help women lose weight from their tums, bums, thighs and upper arms, but still keep their bust intact. M plan: The mushroom diet is the latest crazy diet to be taking tinseltown by storm and Roxanne Pallett and Katy Perry swear by the power of the vegetables . The ‘M-Plan’ is a favourite among . celebrities like Emmerdale's Roxanne Pallett who to want to drop a dress size quickly in time for red . carpet events such as Soap Awards. The diet promises to help women lose weight from the stubborn areas over a 14-day . period by replacing . just one regular lunchtime snack or dinner with a mushroom inspired . dish. Women’s nutritionist and health broadcaster, Jeannette Jackson, explains: 'If we eat more . mushrooms, it’s likely that less high calorie foods will be consumed . throughout the day over all because of the vegetable’s powerful . nutritional values. 'The . dietary fibre in mushrooms helps promote good bowel function leaving you . feeling more satisfied, so you won’t be hungry again as quickly, . preventing you from snacking. Big fan: According to nutritionists, not only do mushrooms help with weight loss - the super vegetable can help improve your looks too and it seems to be working for super slimmer Kelly Osbourne who is a fan . 'Mushrooms . are also extremely rich in protein – an ideal nutritional food source . yet the vegetable is low in calories which is important where weight . loss is considered. 'There’s . a myth that the waist is the last area of the body where women lose . weight. In fact, it’s one of the areas of the body that we move the most . along with bums, thighs and upper arms. 'Not . only do mushrooms help with weight loss – the super vegetable can help . improve your looks too given that mushrooms are high in B vitamins, iron . and zinc, all of which are needed to make your skin, hair and nails . strong, healthy and shiny.' Avid . fans include celebrities such as Emmerdale and Waterloo Road star, . Roxanne Pallett, plus Kelly Osbourne, who both claim to have lost dress . sizes from eating raw mushrooms regularly. How effective is it? According to nutritionists, you simply have to have one meal full of mushrooms, which works for healthy stir frys, but surely not for full English fry ups . Popstar Katy Perry eats a . diet heavy in mushrooms to keep her sexy slender figure. Jeannette added: 'We all know that feeling of losing weight everywhere but where we want, particularly if you’re a typical British pear-shape. 'But the mushroom diet, just like the fungi itself, means you keep the weight where you want it up top and shed pounds where you don’t down below! 'Well there is no denying that mushrooms are a powerhouse of nutritional benefits' 'It’ll be of no surprise that female celebrities will be looking more svelte than normal and I can exclusively reveal that mushrooms are the reason celebrities can look so good at the very last minute.' Lucy Wyndham-Read, the USA Pro fitness and nutrition expert, said: 'Well there is no denying that mushrooms are a powerhouse of nutritional benefits and one of their greatest assets is that they are super Low GI. 'Plus, the fact that they are so very low in calories means, as part of a diet, they can help in weight loss. Plus mushrooms are super cheap, so this is a way to save pounds and drop the pounds. 'But it's untrue that mushrooms have the power to lose fat from everywhere except the bust! I carefully advise women not to expect this to happen and too much of a good thing is actually never a good thing. 'The fact is - if we eat a healthy, well-balanced, clean, natural diet and exercise regularly, we can all lose weight.'

"By . Emma Glanfield . A businesswoman whose company sold ‘edible’ cupcake glitter which was made from shredded plastic has been ordered to pay more than £13,000 in fines and court costs. Margaret Martin's business EdAble Art Ltd, which she claims is named after three animated mice characters called Ed, Able and Art, marketed the dodgy sparkle as an edible decoration when in fact it was made from plastic normally used for drinks bottles. Leeds Magistrates' Court in West Yorkshire heard that she sold the glitter, which is meant for use on greetings cards, to sugar craft suppliers and cake shops in such a way it made them believe it was suitable for consumption. Margaret Martin's business EdAble Art Ltd, which she claims is named after three animated mice characters called Ed, Able and Art, marketed the dodgy glitter, pictured, as an edible decoration when in fact it was made from plastic normally used for drinks bottles . She misled a cake business into believing her products could be eaten and as a result the cake business produced glittered cupcakes coated with the tiny pieces of shredded plastic and sold them to the public, the court was told. Trading Standards warned the plastic material used for the glitter was not edible and was manufactured as craft material. It has a chemical name of polyethylene terephthalate. The effect on the human digestive system is unknown but the glitter should not be eaten. On Monday, the court imposed a total of £13,515 in fines and court costs on both Martin personally and her business. The court fined EdAble Art Ltd a total of £3,500, ordered an additional £8,000 was paid in court costs, as well as a £15 victim surcharge. In addition, Martin was personally handed a 12 month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £2,000 in court costs. Trading Standards warned the plastic material used for the glitter was not edible and was manufactured as craft material. It has a chemical name of polyethylene terephthalate (file picture) The court heard EdAble Art Ltd ignored repeated advice from its local Trading Standards department in Durham and continued to misleadingly market the glitter as edible. Councillor Bill Urry, of the West Yorkshire Trading Standards Committee, said: 'If the company had followed previous advice issued by both their Local Authority and the Food Standards Agency these proceedings would not have been brought. ‘No consumer would want to eat this product if they knew its true composition.’ Leeds Magistrates' Court, pictured,  ordered EdAble Art Ltd to pay a total of £11,515 in court costs and fines. Martin was also handed a 12 month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £2,000 in court costs . Charges were brought under the Food Safety Act 1990 for supplying food not of the nature demanded and the Food Additives (England) Regulations 2009 for supplying a non-approved Food Additive. Martin was also prosecuted under the General Food Regulations 2004 for failure to supply information to the local authority and the Companies Act 2006 for failure to disclose company information. She denied the offences - but was convicted after a three-day trial.","Margaret Martin duped cake businesses into buying the fake 'edible' glitter .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Paramedics were forced to wait outside a hospital for two-and-a-half hours until beds became available for their patients, it has been revealed. A review is being carried out after extra staff had to be drafted in to the James Cook University Hospital, in Middlesbrough, to help ease the pressure on A&E. Seven pre-planned operations also had to be cancelled at the hospital over 27 and 28 of September. A spokeswoman for James Cook University Hospital, in Middlesbrough (pictured) said the increased demand could not have been anticipated at the end of September . Concerns were raised by ambulance crews who claimed to have been left off the road for up to two-and-a-half hours while waiting for a bed. One paramedic said a normal wait would be 10-15 minutes, with two-and-a-half hours the worst they said they had known. The whole of the North-east was said to have been busy for admissions on Thursday with the North East Ambulance Service (NEAS) saying Middlesbrough was most under strain. The ambulance service said in one hour alone they received 999 calls for four ‘Red 1’ incidents - the most serious classification of calls, where patients have suffered either a cardiac arrest or have stopped breathing. Normally they would expect to receive one or two. Spokeswomen for both James Cook University Hospital and the NEAS said the sudden increased pressure could not have been anticipated. Patients were left waiting in ambulances to be admitted to the hospital (file picture) Last week’s flooding was ruled out as a cause. A spokeswoman for the NEAS said: 'The North East Ambulance Service works closely with colleagues in hospitals across the North-east to try and minimise any handover delays. 'We do this by trying to anticipate any peaks in demand, and make the necessary arrangements. 'However some busy periods cannot be anticipated.'","Paramedics said they had to wait anything from 15 minutes to 2.5hours for bed to become available for patients .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Head of the MI5 Sir Jonathan Evans is to stand down next month, after 33 years with the Secret Service . The head of MI5 is to quit next month, MPs were told today. Home Secretary Theresa May said Sir Jonathan Evans would step down after six years in charge of Britain’s spies. It ends a 33-year career with the secret service, which has been transformed from dealing with the Northern Ireland troubles to the threats posed by the Arab Spring on cyber terrorists. Mrs May paid tribute his ‘dedicated’ service over three decades. Speaking at Home Office Questions in the Commons, she told MPs: ‘During this time his contributions have varied from investigating counter espionage, developing and implementing key policies on security and most recently countering the threat of international terrorism. ‘He has experienced the service evolving over the years and as Director General has lead the service through particularly challenging times of change and unrest, including the aftermath of the 7/7 bombings. ‘His tireless work helped ensure the delivery of a safe and successful Olympic and Paralympic Games last year.’ Born in 1958, Sir Jonathan read Classical Studies at Bristol University before joining the Secret Service in 1980. He initially focused on Irish-related terrorism in the 1980s and 1990s, before moving on to international counter-terrorism investigations in 1999. He was appointed director of international counter-terrorism just 10 days before the attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon. He became Director General of MI5 in April 2007, succeeding Lady Manningham-Buller, and his departure comes at the end of his contract term. Home Secretary Theresa May told MPs that security threats to Britain had dramatically evolved since Sir Jonathan joined the service in 1980 . Last year in a rare public speech just a month before the Olympic Games began in London, Sir Jonathan said the Arab world was in ‘radical transition’. ‘Today parts of the Arab world have once more become a permissive environment for al Qaida,’ he said. ‘Some will return to the UK and pose a threat here. This is a new and worrying development and could get worse as events unfold. ‘So we will have to manage the short-term risks if there is to be a longer-term reward from the Arab Spring.’ Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘We also give thanks for the work Sir Jonathan Evans has done over many years for the security of this country.’","Sir Jonathan Evans ends 33-year career with the Secret Service .

"By . Rebecca Seales . Updated: . 15:38 EST, 10 January 2012 . Claude Gueant, a well-known hardliner on immigration, wants the number of expulsions to rise to 35,000 in 2012 . France expelled more illegal immigrants last year than ever before, its government announced today. Interior minister Claude Gueant told a press conference that the French authorities removed 32,912 illegal immigrants in 2011, up 17.5 per cent from 2010. 'This result is 5,000 higher than the initial objective decided upon at the start of the year. It is the highest result ever achieved,' he said. Mr Gueant, a close ally of President . Sarkozy and a well-known hardliner on immigration, said he wants the . number of expulsions to rise to 35,000 this year. He also vowed to significantly reduce legal immigration. Mr . Gueant added that immigrants who want to stay in France will have to . shed traditions which contradict French values, saying: 'We reject ... cloistered lives lived along ethnic and religious grounds, those that . live by their own laws. 'The foreigners that we welcome here must integrate themselves. It is up to them to adapt to us, not the other way around.' The . comment was in part a reference to France's ban on Islamic face veils, a . 2010 law that supporters said defended women's freedoms and critics . said stigmatized millions of moderate Muslims. France is home to the largest Muslim population in western Europe, and many have family ties to former French colonies in North Africa. The majority of immigrants to France arrive legally, but the number of new arrivals is shrinking and Mr Gueant wants to reduce it further. French president Nicolas Sarkozy has championed strict policies on crime and illegal immigration . The number of residency permits issued last year shrank 3.6 percent to 182,595, the interior minister said. 'We want to fight against illegal immigration and control the flow of normal immigration to France. 'What is at stake is the cohesion and the equilibrium of our society and our ability to maintain our tradition of welcoming them,' he told reporters. With the French presidential elections scheduled for April and May, the high-profile announcement is being seen as an attempt by President Sarkozy to appeal to anti-immigrant voters. Mr Sarkozy has championed strict policies on crime and illegal immigration, but is threatened in this area by far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who has a strong voter base and whose National Front party is strongly anti-immigration. While the President has not formally announced his candidacy for the spring elections, he is widely expected to seek a second term in power.","Interior Minister Claude Gueant wants number to rise to 35,000 in 2012 ."
"By . Dan Bloom . Reward: £10,000 has been offered for help catching the killer of Nahid Almanea (pictured) A £10,000 reward has been offered for help catching the person who stabbed a student 16 times on a footpath and left her for dead. Police are still on high alert eight days after the frenzied attack on Saudi national Nahid Almanea, 31, near the University of Essex in Colchester where she studied. Today the charity Crimestoppers announced a reward over her murder - and doubled its reward over another murder in the town which bears chilling similarities. Essex Police do not yet know if the murder of James Attfield in March is linked to that of Nahid Almanea, but they are keeping an 'open mind'. Mr Attfield, 33, was stabbed 102 . times in what officers described as a 'senseless and frenzied' attack in a park in another part of Colchester. Each reward is now worth £10,000 for information leading to the conviction of either murderer. Ann Scott, regional manager for Crimestoppers, said: 'The murder of Nahid has left Colchester residents feeling shocked, saddened and distressed. 'However, during this time of immense tragedy the whole community can unite in helping Essex Police find the person or persons responsible for this horrific murder. 'I would urge anyone with information no matter how insignificant they feel it might be or anyone with niggling suspicions they are unsure of to contact us anonymously safe in the knowledge that their identity will not be revealed. 'And please tell others that there is this safe alternative to pass on information about crime if they do not want to speak directly to police.' The announcement came as officers revealed they have found 38 knives in a huge search near the scene. Haul: Police have found 38 knives in a huge search near the murder scene which included draining three lakes . Painstaking: Officers urged residents to check gardens for anything which could have been used as a weapon . The vast operation has included draining three fishing lakes and urging residents to comb through their gardens. DCI Steve . Worron said: 'Eight days on from the tragic murder of . Nahid Almanea, a guest in our country and a devoted student at the . University of Essex, we continue to make good progress with the . investigation. James Attfield was found dying in March after he was stabbed 102 times as he walked through Colchester's Lower Castle Park. The killing was described as 'one of the most brutal murders' ever seen by police. A post mortem on the father-of-five's body took eight-and-a-half hours to complete due to the shocking extent of the injuries. He was stabbed in his arms, hands, back, neck and head in what police described as a 'senseless and frenzied' attack. Mr Attfield was described as ‘vulnerable’ by his family after he suffered brain damage following a car accident four years ago. He was last seen in CCTV footage drinking at the bar of the River Lodge pub in his home town the evening before he was found dying. He left the pub at 10.09pm and, strangely, left behind almost three quarters of a pint of his beer. Police are still trying to establish what happened between leaving the River Lodge and when Mr Attfield was found injured in Castle Park, Colchester, at 5.45am the next day - March 29. No-one has yet been charged in connection with his murder. The reward to catch his killer has been doubled from £5,000 to £10,000. 'So far we have had a fantastic response from the public, and I'm really grateful for the support they have given us. But I do believe that there are still members of the public who could come forward and help us as witnesses.' Tutors said Ms Almanea was an exceptional English language programme student at the University of Essex who was aiming to study at PhD level. On the day of her murder she was wearing a dark navy blue full length robe, called an Abaya, and a patterned multi-coloured hijab headscarf. She also had with her a black bag with orange panels which she was carrying on a shoulder strap. Since her killing, 600 calls have been made to the incident room, 325 house-to-house inquiries made and 244 people spoken to during stop checks. Richard Barnard, head of the . International Academy at the University of Essex, said Ms . Almanea had recently achieved the highest score in her class for a . recent test - but . was murdered before tutors could tell her the good news. Mr . Barnard paid tribute to her, saying she had a quiet determination to . succeed. 'Nahid had . shown herself to be an exceptional student on our English language . programme since joining the University of Essex in January this year,' he said. 'She . was very focused, always positive and had an inner self-belief. Her . quiet determination to succeed, her hard work and her enthusiasm for her . studies had really impressed her teachers . 'Outside of the class, Nahid was always friendly, considerate and thoughtful with a very polite and courteous manner. 'She . was making very good progress and her confidence was visibly growing. She clearly had so much to offer and was looking forward to going on to . study life sciences at PhD level.' Police are currently keen to speak to three people over the death - including a man who may have been following the student. The man was spotted walking behind two women, one of them possibly Ms Almanea, at around 8.45am on June 13, four days before she was murdered. Similarities: Two people have died after frenzied knife attacks in Colchester within three months . Tragic homecoming: The funeral of Nahid Almanea in her native Saudi Arabia was held last month . Distinctive: DCI Steve Worron, right, shows a picture of a jacket similar to that worn by a man near the scene . He was seen to follow the pair as they came out of a house in Stanley Wooster Way, Colchester, and spoke with a local accent. A second man police are interested in tracing was seen on the Salary Brook Trail - where she was murdered - shortly before Ms Almanea was found. He was wearing a distinctive light brown Italian-style designer jacket. Detectives said he has not yet come forward and they need to speak to him urgently. Officers are also keen to speak to a third man, who was caught on camera shortly after a woman was assaulted in an alleyway between Port Lane and Peache Road, Colchester, on June 19. Anyone with information is asked to contact the incident room on 01245 282103.","Nahid Almanea, 31, knifed 16 times and left to die near University of Essex .

"By . Associated Press . A better outlook for global manufacturing pushed the stock market to an all-time high on Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed within two points of 17,000 for the first time after separate surveys showed that manufacturing expanded in China and the U.S., the world's two biggest economies.

The company rose $19.53, or 7 percent, to $301.94 after French drugmaker Sanofi said in a regulatory filing that it had raised its stake in Regeneron. The S&P 500 index has now gained 6.8 percent this year, after jumping almost 30 percent in 2013. While stocks are no longer cheap, they are still a compelling investment compared with bonds or cash because interest rates are close to zero, said Joe Tanious, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Funds. 'In the long run market prices are dictated by the fundamentals,' said Tanious. 'And the underlying fundamentals suggest that markets can move higher from here.' Government bonds prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed to 2.56 percent from 2.53 percent late Monday. Bond prices have risen this year, pushing interest rates lower, even as the Federal Reserve has reduced its economic stimulus and the economy has improved.

"By . Associated Press . The U.N. Security Council emerged from an emergency session late Sunday on the worsening situation in Gaza expressing 'serious concern' about the rising civilian death toll and demanding an immediate end to the fighting. The council met at the request of Jordan, which proposed a more strongly worded draft resolution for consideration. The resolution, obtained by The Associated Press, expressed 'grave concern' at the high number of civilians killed in Gaza, including children, and called for an immediate cease-fire, 'including the withdrawal of Israeli occupying forces from the Gaza Strip.' The first major ground battle in two weeks of Israel-Hamas fighting on Sunday killed at least 65 Palestinians and 13 Israeli soldiers and forced thousands of terrified Palestinian civilians to flee their neighborhoods. Ceasefire: Palestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour speaks during the meeting. Before it he asked 'If the world body in charge of peace and security is not stopping the killing of our people, where shall we go?' U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon has called Israel's latest incursion 'atrocious,' and said it must do far more to protect civilians. The draft resolution called for the protection of civilians, the lifting of the 'Israeli restrictions imposed on the movement of persons and goods into and out of the Gaza Strip' and immediate humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza. But Jordan's proposed resolution was not discussed, and the acting council president, Rwanda's U.N. Ambassador Eugene-Richard Gasana, emerged to read elements of a more limited press statement that called for the need to improve the humanitarian situation in the region and welcome Egypt's efforts to broker a cease-fire.

The first major ground battle in two weeks of Israel-Hamas fighting on Sunday killed Palestinians and Israelis and forced thousands of terrified Palestinian civilians to flee their neighborhoods . The Palestinian United Nations envoy, Ambassador Riyad Mansour, was disappointed. 'We were hoping for the Security Council to adopt a resolution to condemn the aggression against our people,' he told reporters. But he said Sunday's council statement was 'a test' for Israel to see if it would comply. Before the meeting, Mansour issued a challenge to the council, asking reporters, 'If the world body in charge of peace and security is not stopping the killing of our people, where shall we go?' Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin stepped out of the meeting briefly and complained to reporters that the council had been summoned to meet without a specific proposal to discuss. 'Why have this meeting?' Churkin asked. 'The Security Council is put in a very awkward position. Obviously, nothing is going to come out of it.' After the meeting, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Samantha Power, tweeted: 'Gaza ceasefire would let us address urgent humanitarian needs & underlying issues.

But this time, after being trounced by ITV in the battle of Upstairs v Downton, the BBC is determined to get a head start on its rival. It is racing to complete a new drama, The Paradise, a lavish saga set in a 19th Century department store, hoping to get it on screen before ITV’s latest big production called Mr Selfridge, which tells the story of the American tycoon who founded the famous London store. Head to head: Denise (Joanna Vanderham) in BBC's The Paradise (left) and Jeremy Piven star of ITV's Mr Selfridge (right) Both dramas will cover similar ground and the BBC is keen to ensure its new eight-part show does not suffer the same fate as the revival of Upstairs Downstairs, which bombed in the ratings because Downton, ITV’s master-and-servant saga, was screened first. A BBC source said: ‘We have a very similar situation as we did with Upstairs Downstairs and Downton Abbey and the idea is to get our new show out first.’ Both dramas will have their fair share of steamy love interest – The Paradise is based on Emile Zola’s classic 1883 novel Au Bonheur Des Dames (The Ladies’ Delight), which charted the lives and loves of staff in a fictional Parisian department store. The show’s writer, Bill Gallagher, who wrote Lark Rise To Candleford, has relocated the action from Paris to the North East. John Moray, played by Emun Elliot, in The Paradise which is based on Emile Zola's classic 1883 novel Au Bonheur Des Dames (The Ladies' Delight) Mr Selfridge is based on the book Shopping, Seduction & Mr Selfridge, by Lindy Woodhead – and its screenwriter is Andrew Davies, whose previous TV hits include lusty productions of Pride And Prejudice and Sense And Sensibility, and the sexually explicit Tipping The Velvet. The BBC has invested millions in its new drama, hoping to deliver huge audiences by offering a heady mix of sexual intrigue, class struggle and shopping. Producer Simon Lewis said last night: ‘The Paradise is about relationships and it is about love affairs – in fact we have a lot of love affairs.’ Miss Audrey (Sarah Lancashire) in The Paradise . The series chronicles the love . triangle made up of handsome store owner John Moray, played by Game Of . Thrones star Emun Elliott, wealthy banker’s daughter Katherine . Glendenning, played by Elaine Cassidy, and Denise Lovett, a newly . arrived and very ambitious shop girl played by Joanna Vanderham. Moray is all set to marry Glendenning until Lovett enters his life  and turns his world upside down. The series will also examine The Paradise’s devastating impact on smaller shops and businesses in the area. Characters include the embittered small store owner Edmund Lovett – the uncle of shop girl Denise – played by Peter Wight, who resents the success of the newly opened department store and spends most of his time plotting its demise. Writer Mr Gallagher said: ‘Here comes this brash new department store and there is a little old guy who has got the store across the street. He is desperately trying to cling on and survive and will not accept that his kind of working is doomed.’ Another key character is Miss Audrey, the formidable but lonely head of ladieswear, who is played by former Coronation Street star Sarah Lancashire. The Paradise is being filmed in the Durham area, where the BBC has built elaborate sets including a mock-up of a street complete with period shop fronts. BBC bosses plan to run a trailer for . the show next Saturday at 8pm during the Olympic coverage and are . believed to be planning a 9pm Sunday night slot for the show. They could . broadcast it as early as next January to ensure it starts several weeks . before the new ITV show. Street scene: Jeremy Piven filming the new ITV drama Mr Selfridge in London . Mr Selfridge will star Jeremy Piven, last seen in the American drama Entourage, who will play the charismatic Harry Gordon Selfridge, the man who is said to have turned shopping into a pleasure rather than a necessity. Co-stars include Katherine Kelly, who played Becky McDonald in Coronation Street, as the alluring socialite Lady Mae. Selfridge’s life was as colourful as anything found in the pages of a novel. Following the death of his wife in 1918, he enjoyed liaisons with a string of high-society figures including twin sisters Roszika and Janszieka Deutsch, better known as Vaudeville act The Dolly Sisters, and interior decorator Syrie Maugham. He enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, and by the time he died in 1947 he had squandered his fortune.","BBC's The Paradise is set in a 19th century department store .

'The woman says the secret service and CIA wanted to make sure she wasn't a threat, because she came from Florida to see the royals.‎' Mrs McPhail, who made the 750 mile journey from her home in Orlando, Florida, earlier said she had been planning to follow the princes in a bid to meet them.

They were very nice but they've made me nervous. 'I didn't do anything ‎wrong. I didn't go onto the property where they are staying, I was just outside. They wanted to know what I was doing as I have come all the way from Florida. '‎I'm still glad I came to Memphis to see the royals. I booked to come after first hearing about the wedding six months ago. I went to London for the royal wedding, so this was not that far to go. 'I just want to see them. We’re not used to royalty. I’ve liked the royal family since Princess Diana.’ Mrs McPhail, who is expecting her first child, came to Memphis with her mother-in-law Sheryl, 58. She was standing outside the Memphis Country Club, the venue for Guy Pelly and Lizzy Wilson's rehearsal dinner when she was spoken to by officers. Celebration: Princes William (left) and Harry (right) attend the wedding of their friends Guy Pelly and Lizzy Wilson in Memphis . Motorcade: Police, plain clothes tactical officers and secret service security teams make their way to Memphis Hunt and Polo Club with Princes William and Harry . Becky Heinecky, who was also there, told local station WREG: 'It was kind of scary. It was intimidating to see someone pulled out and specifically targeted.' Security surrounding the princes has been tight since they arrived in the U.S. When they visited Graceland, Elvis Presley's mansion, on Friday there was a ten vehicle motorcade just for the princes. Questions have been asked about the cost to British taxpayers of keeping the princes safe while in Memphis, which is thought to be $84,000. Although the cost of the trip itself is being met privately by the princes, they are accompanied round-the-clock by a team of around four taxpayer-funded officers from Scotland Yard’s Royalty Protection Squad. Partying: Prince Harry walks with his entourage to Rendezvous BBQ in Memphis to honor the bride and groom two nights before the big event . Mad for plaid: Prince William joined his brother and their mates to honor the bride and groom two nights before the big event. Kate stayed at home in London with Prince George .

Some of those will have traveled to Memphis in advance to ‘recce’ the private residence where they are staying and the wedding venue. Others traveled with the brothers personally. One senior industry source estimated the cost of guarding the princes during their five-day trip would be in the region of $84,000, including business class flights and hotels for all of the officers. But retired chief superintendent Dai Davies, former Head of Royal Protection, said: ‘William is a future king and his brother is fourth in line to the throne and serving member of the military which does, unfortunately, make them a major security risk. 'If we accept that we need to protect them 24 hours a day then that protection will, by necessity, extend to trips such as this.’","Royal family are in Tennessee for wedding of nightclub owner Guy Pelly and Holiday Inn heiress Lizzy Wilson .

"By . John Stevens, Political Reporter . Nigel Farage could face punishment from the elections watchdog after he failed to declare £200,000 worth of donations over more than a decade. The UKIP leader received free use of an office in West Sussex from 2001, but did not register the gift with the Electoral Commission until last month. Under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, regulated recipients - including MEPs like Mr Farage - must report gifts within 30 days of accepting them. Nigel Farage could be fined up to £20,000 for failing to declare £200,000 worth of donations over 10 years . Penalties for not complying can include fines of up to £20,000 and, in the most extreme cases, a 12-month prison term. Mr Farage finally registered the use of the premises, a small converted farm building near Littlehampton, in a declaration to the Electoral Commission last month after it wrote to him. He stated that the gift from supporter John Longhurst had been worth £205,602 over 13 years. The Electoral Commission is now considering whether to take actions against the party leader. A spokesman said: ‘Clearly the donations should have been reported to us, and now have been following our correspondence with Nigel Farage. ‘At the moment, our Party Finance team is reviewing all of the necessary information supplied to us by Mr Farage and are considering it carefully. Once this process is complete we will take a decision on whether any further action against him is necessary.’ Former UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom today advised Mr Farage to be 'a little more circumspect' about his closeness to women . Mr Farage today claimed the gift had already been registered with authorities in Brussels. A UKIP spokesman said: ‘Every year since 2001, Mr Farage has declared in his European Parliament Register of Interests the use of a rent-free office from J Longhurst Ltd. ‘The premises has been used as his MEP office so the European Parliamentary register was the logical place for it to be declared. ‘Mr Farage was surprised to learn that the Electoral Commission thought it should be informed as well as this did not accord with the professional advice he had received at the time.’ It came as controversial former UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom yesterday said that Mr Farage should be ‘a little more circumspect’ about his closeness to women. He said the Ukip leader needed to be careful after he was last week photographed returning to his hotel with a woman at 3am. Mr Bloom who resigned from the party last year after a number of outspoken remarks, told the BBC’s Daily Politics: ‘I think perhaps if I was his old dad I’d say be a little more circumspect, but that’s the pot calling the kettle black with me.’ The 64-year-old, who shared a flat in Brussels with Mr Farage for several years, stepped down after he referred to women as ‘sluts’ and struck a journalist on the street. He earlier attracted claims of racism by denouncing aid being sent to 'bongo bongo land'. Mr Bloom said he was still friends with Mr Farage. He said: ‘We had a sherbet the other day. I think you can fall out in politics or professionally without having to scratch each other eyes out.’","UKIP leader enjoyed free use of an office in West Sussex every year .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Reports the couple have employed a professional nanny come as the family prepares for their first official tour . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have hired a Spanish supernanny for Prince George, it has been claimed. Prince William and Kate have chosen a nanny said to be in her mid-thirties who has worked for high-society families for two decades. The news comes as photos emerged this weekend of the eight-month-old prince with a childminder in Hyde Park, as his parents holiday in the Maldives. A friend of the unnamed nanny told Hello! magazine: 'She has worked with other prominent high-society families in the past. 'It was from there that the Cambridges heard of her and hired her. 'She is not married and doesn't have a boyfriend as her life is totally dedicated to the family she is working with. 'She is known for being totally professional - married to the job.' William and Kate have made clear they intend to be hands-on parents. They have often enlisted the help of Kate's mother Carole Middleton, as well as occassionally employing William's former nanny Jessie Webb. However, with their upcoming tour of Australia and New Zealand signalling the start of more frequent public engagements, sources claim the royal couple is eager to secure an aide. The pair faced a barrage of criticism when they flew off on their second honeymoon last week. The couple have flown to an exclusive resort on the Maldives, leaving their baby with Carole and Michael Middleton – plus his own security detail – at their Berkshire mansion. But the decision sparked a storm on social networking sites Mumsnet and Twitter. Critics said they were wrong to leave the young Prince for so long, while others were concerned about the extravagance of their stay only a few weeks after the whole family, including George, went to Mustique. William and Kate always said they want to be hands-on parents but their list of duties is growing . Kate's mother Carole and William's former nanny Jessie Webb have previously helped out with childminding . The couple arrived at Cheval Blanc Randheli on Noonu Atoll, on Thursday for a week-long break. Packages there, including flights, can cost £6,799 a person. Some people questioned how Prince William, already condemned for boar hunting in Spain last month, was able to take time off from his ten-week agriculture management course at Cambridge University. However, a number of other commenters said the move may suggest they have already found a nanny to care for him while they are gone. Clarence House declined to comment.","Aide in mid-30s 'worked for high-society families royal couple know'

"By . John Stevens, Political Reporter . The popularity of Twitter and other social media has killed off thoughtful reflection, the Archbishop of Canterbury has warned. ‘Instant reaction’ has replaced  ‘reflective comment’ in a 21st century revolution of communications, said the Most Reverend Justin Welby. He told an audience including David Cameron and Ed Miliband of the dangers of squeezing sophisticated arguments into a tweet. Warning: The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby warned MPs not to put too much faith in social media such as Twitter, where comments which once took months to take root now explode in seconds . ‘The comments that even 20 years ago took months to reach the far corners of the Earth, now, as we know, take seconds,’ he said. ‘The best answer to a complex issue is not always given in 140 characters. ‘The Church of this century must be a . generous Church because of that communications revolution, because of . technology, because we are face to face with everyone everywhere always, . in a way we never have been in history.’ His . remarks came as he addressed a meeting of 700 MPs, peers, church and . charity representatives at the National Parliamentary Prayer Breakfast . in Westminster. He said technology means we are ‘face to face with everyone everywhere always, in a way we never have been in history’. The Archbishop also used his speech in Westminster yesterday to defend church schools in the wake of the ‘Trojan Horse’ allegations of a takeover plot in Birmingham schools by hardline Muslims. ‘In this country alone we educate nearly a million children in the Church of England, another half a million through the Roman Catholic schools, and, let me say, no recent problems were in one of the church schools,’ he said. Twitter takeover: The platform has become an increasing presence in public life - and on the stock market . ‘It is the church schools that stand for tolerance, acceptance, reception, generosity, open-handedness. Education is something which the Church has done for centuries, which it held in its monasteries when the rest of the world had given up on it in western Europe, and we do it today.’ Christians, who are ‘generous and hospitable’, should be ‘utterly at home’ in a multi-faith world, he argued. ‘The church is not an NGO with lots of old buildings – it is the Church of God, rejoicing in the realities of cultural diversity in a way never known before,’ he said. The Archbishop also warned that it was ‘easy’ to be cynical about politics - but he praised the government’s commitment to maintain international aid at 0.7 per cent of GDP and the introduction of the Modern Slavery Bill. He said: ‘Those aren’t cynical vote-winners, from any politician in this room, but they arise from a spirit of generosity, which is right and proper.’","Most Reverend Justin Welby made comments in major Westminster speech .

The supermarket is taking the four-packs off the shelves with sell-by dates up to and including July 2014. ‘As a precautionary measure, we have issued a product recall,’ said a Tesco spokesman. ‘We are urgently investigating this incident with our supplier and ask customers to return this product to their local store.’ A spokesman for the Food Standards Agency said: ‘If you have bought the product, do not eat it. Instead, return it to the store where you bought it for a full refund or contact Tesco customer services on 0800 50 55 55. ‘No other Tesco products are known to be affected.’ The supplier which makes the cones for Tesco is R&R Ice Cream. The frozen treats are the fourth in a series of products to be recalled by the supermarket giant this year. In January it asked customers to return its finest Belgian chocolate salted caramel and hazelnut ice cream because the packs had been incorrectly labelled. They actually contained orange blossom honey and almond ice cream and the error made the product potentially dangerous to nut allergy sufferers. Later in the year the supermarket’s own-brand yeast extracts were recalled because of a risk of high levels of histamine. In August, Tesco’s range of ready meals were taken off the shelves because they contained mouldy rice. Eight products in the Ambient range were affected, including jalfrezi, Szechuan chicken, chilli con carne and tikka masala.

"By . Laura Clark, Education Correspondent . Facing the most challenging and complex job market in living memory, teenagers are increasingly looking to their parents for guidance about their future careers (file picture) It is the stage of life when they are looking to forge their own identity. But many of today’s teenagers are looking no further than their parents for inspiration and guidance. They are more likely than the previous five generations to want the same career as their mother or father, study has found. A third expect to follow in their parents’ footsteps – more than at any time over the last 100 years. It is thought that teenagers are increasingly seeking to make the most of family connections to kick-start their careers in an intensely competitive job market. But researchers also suggest that parents – particularly mothers – are more likely to have carved out careers for themselves that their children want to follow. The findings emerged in a study to chart the ‘evolution of the teenager’ over the past century. Commissioned to mark the outbreak of the First World War, it paints a picture of dramatically changing attitudes to work, role models, family, ambition and obstacles to employment. Today’s teenagers emerged as the most driven generation in 100 years, as well the most entrepreneurial. They also valued education and qualifications more highly than previous generations, which tended to see character traits such as leadership as more important than schooling for finding work. But they face the most challenging and complex job market in living memory, with 92 per cent expecting to encounter barriers when looking for long-term employment. Perhaps the study’s most surprising’ finding was that today’s teenagers, known as ‘generation citizen’, were the most likely to want a similar job to their parents, despite the variety of careers now available. A third said they expected to follow in parents’ footsteps – twice as many as a century ago. Dr Heather Ellis, from Liverpool Hope University, who helped compile the report, said: ‘I think it relates to increasing levels of social mobility, with young people increasingly looking to within their own families for career inspiration, rather than to more traditional role models such as bosses and teachers.’ She said youngsters were also seeking work experience at their parents’ place of work. Parents nowadays may also have a better understanding of the job market. The research, commissioned by the National Citizen Service, a government-backed scheme to encourage community work among teenagers, questioned 3,600 Britons across six generations. The oldest group surveyed were 100 from the ‘greatest generation’, the over-90s. Born around the time of the First World War, serving one’s country and supporting one’s family were for them more important than a career. The study, carried out at Liverpool Hope University, was commissioned to mark the outbreak of the First World War. It found that priorities for people born 100 years ago were serving one¿s country and supporting one¿s family . Just 17 per cent followed in their parents’ footsteps when choosing a livelihood. A further 500 were questioned from the ‘silent generation’, those aged 72 to 89, who were probably too young to fight in the Second World War but as teenagers may have experienced its hardships. They were more likely to look to traditional role models such as teachers or bosses than parents. The researchers also questioned 1,000 ‘baby boomers’, who are now aged 54 to 71, 1,000 from ‘generation X’, now aged 32 to 53 as well as 500 from ‘generation Y’, who are aged 19 to 32 and 500 from ‘generation citizen’, or 13 to 19-year-olds. ‘Generation citizen’ emerged as the most driven, declaring that career success was one of the most important things in life for them. Only the ‘silent generation’,  who grew up in the Great Depression of the 1930s, showed similar aspiration.","Third of teenagers now expect to follow in parents' footsteps, report finds .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Not her idea: Teacher Natalia Sokolson Gordon insists the cop forced her to sext him . A New York City school investigator used his position of power to blackmail a teacher into sexting him so that she could keep her job, she claims. Natalya Sokolson Gordon, who teaches fifth graders at PS 329 in Coney Island, says she felt she had no choice but to give in to Lawrence Scott's demands last year as he barraged her with hundreds of raunchy text messages and even a picture of his genitals. Ms Gordon, 44, has filed formal complaints against the New York City Department of Education and Mr Scott, claiming that he groped her during a closed-door meeting and compelled her to send him naked pictures of herself in an attempt to save her job. She told the New York Post: 'I feel so stupid for believing he would help me. I was scared I was going to lose my job. I felt I had no choice. He had my life in his hands.' Mr Scott, who is married, admitted to the Post that he sent Ms Gordon raunchy messages, but denied assaulting her. 'She initiated it. I never forced anything on her. There was no quid pro quo,' he told the newspaper. 'Let me see those t***' Mr Scott demanded in one text message. 'So are u aggressive sexually?' he asked in another. 'Why wud you like me to be,' Ms Gordon replies. 'Yes,' Mr Scott responds. In one series of exchanges, Mr Scott describes various sexual positions. 'Some may force u to scream,' he tells her. Natalya Sokolson Gordon, 44, teaches fifth grade at PS 329 on Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York . Gordon was being investigated after . supervisors charged last January that she grabbed several students and . made a crude gesture while speaking about Principal Salema Marbury.

Mr Scott first met with Ms Gordon about the case against her, he . reportedly told her: '“I have the power to get rid of you just like . that' and snapped his fingers. 'Or I can make everything go away.' Then, he started sending her sexually-explicit messages, Ms Gordon says. For two and a half months, the pair exchanged text messages. Ms Godon frequently replied and admitted to sending him topless and bottomless photos. She claims she felt she had to entertain the perverse gestures or she would lose her job. In October, Ms Gordon turned over 275 pages of text messages to the Special Commissioner of Investigation. When Mrs Scott was confronted with the texts, he quit his 65,000-a-year job. Ms Gordon says detectives from the Special Commissioner of Investigation launched an investigation of her because she replied to Mr Scott's texts for months before reporting him.","Natalya Sokolson Gordon, 44, has filed a formal complaint alleging investigator Lawrence Scott forced her to send him raunchy text messages and groped her .

"By . John Stevens, Political Reporter . An MP who was suspended from the Liberal Democrats over claims he sexually harassed a vulnerable constituent publicly apologised to her yesterday. Mike Hancock admitted he had ‘crossed the line’ and had an ‘inappropriate and unprofessional’ relationship with the woman after she asked him for help with noisy neighbours. But in an extraordinary development last night, it emerged he will not face an investigation by the parliamentary sleaze watchdog – meaning he could cling on as an independent MP until next year’s election. Portsmouth South MP, Mike Hancock leaves his home in Fareham, Hampshire admitted that his relationship with a vulnerable constituent had 'crossed a line' The 68-year-old, who represents Portsmouth South, had repeatedly denied the allegations by the single mother, known only as ‘Annie’ or ‘AH’, during her four-year fight to obtain an apology. But yesterday as part of a High Court settlement he apologised unreservedly for any distress. The case is a major embarrassment for Nick Clegg, who was accused of turning a blind eye to the claims, and follows a string of sex scandals to engulf the Lib Dems. In a statement read at the High Court yesterday, Mr Hancock said: ‘In October 2009 you first came to me as a constituent to seek my assistance as your MP and councillor. The former Lib Dem faces an internal party investigation into his behaviour . Subsequently and over several months I came to your home on several occasions, sometimes unannounced and conducted a friendship that was inappropriate and unprofessional. ‘I understand that you felt degraded. I did not treat you with sufficient respect. I made you feel deeply uncomfortable and discriminated against and I crossed the line. As a political representative, there is a significant power differential with any constituent seeking help and particularly with your vulnerability of which I was aware. ‘You had a right to trust me. Everyone should feel safe and should be able to have confidence in their political representatives and I am sorry I made you feel otherwise. I have learnt from my mistakes and pledge not to act in the same way again.’ He added: ‘I also recognise that hurtful and untrue statements were made publicly about your motivation in bringing the claim. These statements sought to discredit and undermine you. ‘This should never have happened. I accept that you did not bring the claim for financial gain and any statements to the contrary were wrong.’ The 39-year-old woman had attempted to complain about Mr Hancock’s behaviour through the police, the office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, as well as the Liberal Democrat party and Portsmouth City Council, but her solicitor yesterday said she had been ‘blocked from achieving a remedy at each stage’. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she had contemplated suicide over the ‘disgusting’ way she had been treated by the Liberal Democrats. Yesterday she said: ‘I am pleased that there has finally been a resolution to what has been a long and hurtful ordeal for me. Since the incidents about which I complained happened back in 2010, my physical and mental health have suffered and I am grateful that I may now have some closure to this traumatic episode in the lives of both myself and my son.’ The woman first met Mr Hancock in October 2009 at his constituency office in Southsea, after seeking help to deal with noisy neighbours. A year later, he was arrested after she complained to a carer about his alleged sexual advances. He was never charged after police found there was no case to answer. ■ In 2011, a Russian woman accused of being a spy admitted having a four-year affair with Hancock while she worked as his researcher. Ekaterina Zatuliveter (right) revealed the relationship in court in 2011 as she successfully fought deportation after it was claimed she  targeted the MP as part of a ‘honeytrap’ operation. During her time working with Hancock, she even moved into his London flat. ■ Earlier that year, Hancock admitted having a ‘close and affectionate relationship’ with a 17-year-old girl. The pair met at his office when she inquired about undertaking work experience. ‘It was a very affectionate relationship – it was strong but not sexual,’ he said. ‘There was contact between us – a kiss and cuddle but no more than that.’ ■ In 2010 it was claimed that Hancock had helped another Russian woman, 25-year-old Ekaterina Paderina, to stay in Britain after she ran into visa problems in the Nineties. Miss Paderina’s ex-husband said the MP went out of his way to help the blonde after she paid several visits to his office. ■ Hancock was also accused of having two affairs with colleagues during the Eighties and Nineties. The marriage of Liz McCann (right), a Lib Dem councillor and a mother of three, broke up as a result of their relationship. ‘I had heard about his reputation for women which goes before him in the party,’ she said. Hancock was also said to have had a six-year affair with Daphne Sparshatt, his constituency secretary. She told a newspaper: ‘He’s no great looker, he’s not God’s gift to women, but he charms his way in.’ ■ There have also been allegations that Hancock had a relationship with Daniela Aura Dobre, 20, whom he met during an aid trip to a village near Bucharest in October 1990. She claimed: ‘We were very close. I miss him very much. He’s a kind and charming man. He came on many trips, first in October 1990, then Christmas that year, then in January, March and April or May. I saw him each time.’ In March 2011, the woman complained about Mr Hancock to senior Lib Dem officials at the party’s Westminster headquarters, but no action was taken against him. In a letter to Mr Clegg’s office in February last year, she said Mr  Hancock had exposed himself to her, made numerous unwanted sexual advances and forcibly kissed her, but he was still not disciplined. Last night she told the Mail: ‘Nick Clegg has been negligent. He should have acted sooner and taken notice of a woman in my position.’ The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards can examine financial wrongdoing but cannot investigate claims an MP has abused their position in other ways. It means Mr Hancock could keep his seat until the next election. Portsmouth City Council did ask Nigel Pascoe QC to investigate the allegations. But his report was never published and the Lib Dem-controlled council voted to keep it under wraps. In his conclusions, Mr Pascoe wrote: ‘Making full allowances for the disclosed mental history of AH, I have no doubt that she has provided before me compelling prima facie evidence of serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour carried out towards her by Mr Hancock.’ Mr Hancock was suspended from the Lib Dems in January after the case became public. The party yesterday said a disciplinary investigation will now be re-started.","Former Lib Dem Mike Hancock admitted he had 'crossed the line'

"By . Laura Clark . Teenagers will be given an extra maths lesson a week to bring England in line with the highest-performing countries in the world. Schools will be told to devote more time to the subject to help close the achievement gap with education systems in places such as Hong Kong and Singapore. Global league tables rank England 39th out of 42 for the amount of lesson time spent on maths. Pupils will be taught an extra hours of maths a week to bring pupils into line with highest-performing countries . English will also be toughened up with a shift away from studies of celebrities and greater emphasis on writing that is more ‘substantial’. Recent English GCSEs have allowed pupils to study the rambling armchair stories of comedian Ronnie Corbett and storylines from Downton Abbey. The measures were unveiled yesterday as part of radical Coalition plans to overhaul the curriculum to combat years of ‘dumbing down’. Ministers gave further details of arrangements for English and maths to be studied by 14-year-olds from September. In maths, teenagers will study around a third more content – including new sections on ratio, proportion, vectors and conditional probability. English will also be toughened up with a greater emphasis on 'substantial' writing and a move away from celebs . They will also be required to learn by heart key formulae  such as the sine and cosine rules, and the formula for the area of a triangle. Schools will be expected to lay on an extra maths lesson each week, which are usually around 45 minutes long. Ministers dismissed complaints from teachers that proposed new courses were too challenging, too large and could place ‘excessive demands’ on pupils. The Department for Education said: ‘The new courses are ‘wider and deeper than the current programme and this  is intentional’. It added: ‘International comparisons of performance in mathematics show that England’s pupils have been falling behind our competitors. ‘An extra lesson each week would put England closer to jurisdictions such as Hong Kong and Singapore, which both teach an average of 138 hours a year of mathematics at secondary level.’ England, in contrast, spends 116 hours a year teaching maths, or three a week during term time. Meanwhile, one in five teachers who responded to proposals for English syllabuses complained that ‘multi-media texts’ would be omitted. But the DfE said: ‘We believe some forms of multi-media texts do not provide sufficiently rich, substantial writing to promote the development of a deep understanding and appreciation of the English language.’ Education Minister Liz Truss said: ‘The amount of time  currently given to maths teaching in our secondary schools lags behind the time afforded this key subject in world-leading countries. It is essential this  is corrected.’","English pupils currently rank 39th of 42 in hours dedicated to maths .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A lovelorn pensioner armed with a pedal bike and 10,000 leaflets has launched a desperate bid to find his true love, 55 years after they met at a dance hall. Herbert Riley, 83, fell head over heels in love with Reeni as a 24-year-old in Stockport. Today the pensioner, who now lives in Longsight, Manchester, is calling for help to make one last ditch attempt to track down Reeni, so he can leave his lifetime savings to her before he dies. Lovelorn Herbert Riley fell in love with Reeni as a 24-year-old at a dance hall in Salford, Greater Manchester. But after the couple rowed one day, Reeni left for Scotland where she met and married another man . Mr Riley has spent £200 printing 10,000 leaflets in his bid to track down Reeni, who he last spotted working in the bakers Hobson's Choice in the 1980s . The pair danced together several times a week but after a four-year relationship, Reeni left Herbert to marry another man she had only known for a few weeks. The former engineer revealed he went three decades without seeing his true love, before spotting her while she worked in a bakery in the 1980s. But the pensioner struggled to pluck up the courage to speak to her before moving to work in Birmingham a short while later. And he has now printed 10,000 leaflets to track down his mystery woman, and is calling for anyone with help to get in touch. Mr Riley said: 'We were together for four years and I genuinely thought we would be together forever. Mission: Armed with just his push bike, Mr Riley is determined to track down Reeni, who he met in the 1950s . 'She was an incredible dancer. We'd go four or five times a week at the local ballroom hall and I enjoyed every minute. 'But one day we had a row and she went up to Scotland with a friend where she met someone else and just like that our relationship came to an end. 'At some point during the 1980s I actually saw her working Hobson's Choice bakery in Reddish but she was always very busy so I didn't talk to her. 'Not too long after I was made redundant and had to go to work in Birmingham for a year but when I returned to Manchester the bakery had closed down and I thought that I'd missed my chance.' After the relationship, Herbert tied the knot with another love, Margaret, in 1959. But Mrs Riley tragically died of leukaemia four years later at the age of 34. Childless Mr Riley has not fallen in love since and despite not remembering her surname, he was determined to track down Reeni, who he described as 'the woman he never forgot'. He added: 'I paid a friend £200 to make the leaflets and distribute them around Reddish so I could track her down. 'I've had quite a few calls already but sadly none of them are genuine so I'm just hoping people see the posters and find Reeni for me. 'Looking back, I should have taken my chance when I saw her all those years ago but hopefully by doing this I'll get a second chance before I die.' Do you know Reeni?

"By . Lizzie Parry . A great grandmother has been banned from visiting a day centre in her own wheelchair after council health and safety bosses said it was made of the 'wrong' kind of metal. Retired nurse Ryta Grimston, 80, has been enjoying her outings to the centre in Selby, in her aluminium chair for six years without any complaints. But the pensioner was shocked to be told she has to leave her chair at home because it is not 'crash proof' according to a new 'risk assessment'. Banned: Ryta Grimston, 80, has been told by North Yorkshire County Council that she can no longer be transported to a day centre in Selby in her aluminium wheelchair, because it is not 'crash proof'. The great grandmother has been told she must use a council approved steel chair instead. Mrs Grimston pays £2.40 a time to be transported by North Yorkshire County Council from the doorstep of her home in Selby to the day centre three miles away. Because the chair is not steel, but softer metal, council bosses are concerned about the risks of transporting her there in a wheelchair taxi or minibus. The authority fears that if there was a crash during the eight-minute journey the chair’s frame might not withstand the impact - and the council could be held liable. Mrs Grimston said the first she knew of the new rule was when the council taxi service told her: ‘I’m sorry. We can’t take you because your wheelchair is not crash proof.' Now the council drivers have to pick up a spare steel wheelchair from the day centre, take it to Mrs Grimston's home, and take her to the day centre in it. But the steel chair is too heavy for . her to propel herself so she has to be pushed around by the care staff . when she arrives - or just slump in an arm chair. She . does not have the use of her left hand, having suffered a stroke . affecting her left hand side, and would therefore be unable to move the . heavier chair without help. Mrs . Grimston, of Thorpe Willoughby, Selby, has branded the ban ridiculous, . particularly since she uses her own chair when her family take her out . in a car. She has also been told by some of the . care workers that they have taken clients out in the same type of . aluminium chair without problems. She . said: 'It is stupid idea. I have been going to the centre all these . years in the aluminium chair and no one has said anything. Lifeline: The retired nurse has been visiting the Carentan House day centre (pictured) for six years, with no problems. But North Yorkshire County Council has now said her aluminuim wheelchair is not strong enough to withstand any possible crash, while travelling to and from the centre . 'Everyone has been having a good laugh about it. But on the serious side it has really upset me and I can’t sleep. 'It is health and safety gone mad. My son asked me what the punch line was and I said ""it is not a joke - it’s true"". Anger: Mrs Grimston branded the council risk assessment 'stupid', adding: 'It's health and safety gone mad' 'I have just paid over £75 for a new seat for my chair - and now they say it is no flipping good. 'There is no way I’m buying a steel one. A steel one would be too heavy and there is a long waiting list anyway.' Her family say her visits to the Carentan House day centre have been a lifeline in the 80-year-old's twilight years. She has dinner there with her friends, plays bingo and dominoes, does a spot of baking, and goes for picnics in the local park. Mrs Grimston added: 'Going to the day . centre is the only time I can get out. I have had a stroke and can’t . move far or walk very much. 'Sometimes they take us on to Bridlington on day trips in a mini bus. I suppose I won’t be able to go on those either now. 'The silly thing is if I go in an ambulance to hospital for a check-up I go in my own chair. 'If . it can go in the back of an ambulance I don’t see why the council can’t . take me anywhere in it and the carers say they regularly take clients . out in aluminium chairs.' A . council spokeswoman said: 'The county council must ensure that people . transported in wheelchairs in any of our vehicles are safe. 'Over the last couple of years . therefore the county council has been carrying out a rolling programme . of risk assessments to ensure that wheelchairs are suitable to be used . on transport in line with the manufacturers’ guidelines. 'In . cases where wheelchairs are found to be not suitable for . transportation, the county council makes every effort to ensure that . users are able to access their usual services. 'In this case, the county council has arranged for a suitable wheelchair to be made available on a temporary basis so the customer can be transported in the usual way, until a permanent solution can be found.' But The Selby and Ainsty Tory MP Nigel Adams said: 'It sounds like box ticking gone mad. I shall be looking into this. 'If Mrs Grimston wants to get in touch with me I will speak to the county council on her behalf. 'But on the face of it seems like one of the local authority more bizarre dictats. 'There is clearly no health safety risk while she is inside the day centre. It is just a transportation issue.'","Ryta Grimston has been visiting Carentan House day centre for six years .

"By . Laura Clark . Former Labour Education Secretary David Blunkett has drawn up a raft of proposals on improving schools . Schools would face tighter admissions rules and close scrutiny from ‘standards tsars’ under sweeping Labour proposals for reforming state education. Ministers accused Labour of attempting to bring back tiers of bureaucracy after the party unveiled plans for dozens of new local directors overseeing heads and governors. Schools would also face an admissions crackdown to stop middle-class pupils dominating places at sought-after schools. Watchdogs will be able to force governors to rewrite their admissions policies. Schools will also be required to operate within local rules amid evidence of ‘widespread non-compliance’ with a national code designed to prevent covert selection. The plans represent Labour’s answer to the academy and free school revolution led by Education Secretary Michael Gove, which has freed hundreds of heads from local authority control. Under Labour’s blueprint, all schools in an area – including academies and free schools – will be overseen by ‘directors of school standards’ with the power to intervene. They would be responsible for . driving up performance in struggling schools - including those merely . coasting or ‘fragile’ - and responding to the views of parents and the . wider public. They would be expected to team up failing schools with stronger neighbours and ultimately force changes of leadership. Parents concerned about standards in schools will also be able to demand that directors take action. They will be able to call in a new . standards supremo to tackle under-performance under plans expected to . form the centrepiece of Labour’s manifesto for education. The plans were drawn up by David Blunkett, Tony Blair’s first education secretary, who said the overhaul was aimed at reversing the ‘ridiculous situation’ of schools being run from Whitehall.‘New local Directors of School Standards will monitor, support and challenge schools to improve, driving up standards in underperforming and “fragile” schools – irrespective of the status of the school,’ he said . But a spokesman for Mr Gove said: ‘We are taking power over schools from politicians and giving it to the heads and teachers who know the children’s names. Sadly, Labour’s announcement today means going in the opposite direction.’ Failing schools would be forced to team up with stronger neighbours and could see headteachers fires under Mr Blunkett's reforms (file picture) In . further measures proposed by Mr Blunkett, recommendations for . tightening admissions would lead to the Office of the Schools . Adjudicator being able to direct schools to change their policies. His . report also said schools should be barred from opting out of . locally-agreed admissions rules, although they would still be able to . set their own policies. Shadow . Education Secretary Tristram Hunt yesterday accepted Mr Blunkett’s . proposal to introduce standards tsars, while other plans remain under . consideration. He claimed that under Mr Gove schools were being left to . ‘sink or swim’. Mr Hunt said: 'David’s record on raising school standards speaks for itself. This is an incredibly important report. 'Under . Michael Gove schools are being left to ‘sink or swim’ – more than 1.5m . children are in underperforming schools. That's why Labour will . introduce new and robust local oversight of all schools to raise . standards. That’s what new Directors of School Standards will bring.' Mr . Blunkett told the Mail his proposals were aimed at ending the ‘current . ridiculous situation where the Secretary of State is gradually . contractually overseeing thousands of schools’. Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt is understood to have accepted the ideas . ‘Putting . the glue back into the system means overturning the fractured and . “atomised” landscape, as Sir Michael Wilshaw, Chief Inspector of Schools . has put it,’ he said. But . he said there would be ‘no going backwards under my recommendations’ and . no return to the days of local authorities running all schools. ‘Instead, . we would want to build on what’s already there, ensure there is . absolutely transparency, fairness and, above all, that everyone knows . who is responsible for school improvement - world class head teachers . and the highest quality classroom teachers, supported by the new local . Director of School Standards.’ The . directors would also work with local authorities to plan new schools . and provide extra places, with an expectation they would allow popular . schools to expand if they wished to. They would oversee competitions between providers to open new schools where needed. Mr Blunkett was asked by Labour leader Ed Miliband to oversee education policy development. The proposed reforms draw on the London Challenge initiative which has been credited with transforming standards in London schools. The scheme used measures such as heads collaborating to raise standards and changes of leadership where required. There was also a concerted attempt to break the link between poverty and poor results with ‘zero tolerance’ of low expectations. The independent directors would be a statutory appointment made from a shortlist of candidates. Councils would join together to appoint a shared DSS across a local area or sub-region. Mr Blunkett says memory tests - something Mr Gove has pushed strenuously - are 'important' but warns the education system must offer 'much more than this'. He adds: 'Schools and colleges are not factories to instil facts, and then hope that young people somehow make sense of them and become function and creative adults. 'We have to provide the opportunity to build those think or critical skills, which allow the analytical faculties to develop - to be able to challenge, as well as to make sense of the ever-changing world around us.' The report recommends the creation of temporary 'education incubation zones' where the latest teaching methods and technology would be used to help raise standards and the introduction of a duty on government to represent the interests of pupils and parents. It underlines Labour's existing calls for teachers to be properly qualified and an end to the ability of some schools to opt out of local admissions codes. Mr Blunkett said the emphasis of Labour's policy was 'entirely on delivering inspiration teaching and aspirational learning'.","Ex-Education Secretary sets out plans to tackle poor standards .

"By . Ruth Styles . A talented French designer has created an amazing table that also doubles as a home for your pet canaries. The Cage Archibird, now on display at the Galerie Gosserez in Paris, was created by Grégoire de Lafforest, who told Design Milk that it was designed to 'break convention'. He added: 'The idea was to develop a cage as break from conventional codes and ensure the integration of a habitat as if in a mixing bowl. Theatrical: The Cage Archibald is intended to bring a sense of the theatrical to table design . No need for flowers! The Cage Archibird has tabletop decoration covered thanks to its bell jars . 'The connection between the cage and glass bells refers to the stuffed birds who live there, as well as a nod to cabinets of curiosities. 'The bird cages are designed to look like glass bells as a nod to the idea of stuffed birds or taxidermy.' He went on: 'The bird is staged as if in a theatre. It gives the traditional table a theatrical aspect and is an homage to curiosity cabinets.' The table itself consists of a sleekly modernist pine top, with a delicate white-painted cage beneath and three glass bells on top. Curiosities: According to Grégoire de Lafforest, the design was inspired by nature and curiosity cabinets . Clever: From below, the incredible attention to detail and cleverly worked branches are revealed . Inside the cage are three stuffed orange . birds, although there's nothing to stop buyers from introducing real . ones - provided they aren't worried about the mess. The stunning photos of the Cage Archibird were shot by Jérome Galland, an up-and-coming photographer who specialises in design. Lafforest, who adds on his website that the table represents an 'idealised vision of nature' is no stranger to work that pushes the boundaries. Other striking efforts include the Bibliothèque Tolbiac, a bookcase designed to resemble a set of stairs and Lampe Olab, a stunning blown glass and steel lamp that looks like a tiny hot air balloon. Another interesting piece is the Tabouret Montaigne, a delicate leather stool that resembles an upended thimble. For more information, see gregoiredelaforrest.com .
