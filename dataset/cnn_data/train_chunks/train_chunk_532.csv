"PUBLISHED: . 14:46 EST, 5 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:47 EST, 5 December 2012 . Life sentence: Paul Taylor murdered 22-year-old Sally McGrath over 30 years ago and buried her in a shallow grave . A violent and predatory rapist who avoided justice for more than three decades after brutally murdering a 22-year-old woman has today been jailed for life. Fish and chip shop owner Paul Taylor, now 60, killed former supermarket worker Sally McGrath and buried her naked body in a shallow grave in Cambridgeshire woodland in July 1979. Her remains were eventually discovered in 1980, but the mystery of her death would remain unsolved for the next 32 years. Taylor was finally brought to justice after a cold case review was launched in 2009 and detectives decided to re-interview the former soldier, who had been a suspect in the initial investigation. Chelmsford Crown Court was told the killer, who was also convicted of a string of sex attacks on other women during the late 1970s, will serve a minimum term of 18 years for Miss McGrath's murder. Detectives are now exploring the possibility that Taylor was responsible for other sex attacks, and are focusing on the Hampshire region where he lived in recent years. A judge said today: 'I think it is clear there was a sexual element to the murder of Sally McGrath. 'The evidence revealed a pattern of behaviour in which you lured your victims in under the pretence of giving them a lift home,' said Mr Justice Owen. 'You then drove them to a rural or isolated area and forced yourself upon them. 'Your predatory sexual attacks took place over 30 years ago but your victims have been left scarred for life. 'I have no doubt the brutal murder of Sally McGrath followed the same pattern and resulted from her resistance to your sexual demands.' Taylor had shown no emotion as the . jury of eight men and four women unanimously found him guilty of murder . after deliberating for nearly 23 hours. The former solider, from Fareham, . Hampshire, was also found guilty of three counts of rape, one count of . attempted rape and another serious sexual assault relating to three . other women. Taylor, who was 27 at the time of the murder, was described as a reasonably good-looking and strong man who had a reputation as a womaniser despite being married. Victim: Sally McGrath, left, was brutally killed by Paul Taylor, seen right around the time of the attack, in the summer of 1979 . In March 1979 he repeatedly raped a 19-year-old after offering her a lift home from the Bull Hotel in Peterborough. A month later Taylor attacked a 24-year-old girl after offering her a lift home from a Christening party near the town. Mr Justice Owen . The jury heard that as he drove her back he pulled into a layby and grabbed her by the back of the neck saying: 'You know you want it.' When she resisted Taylor punched her in the face then pushed her from his vehicle and drove off, the court heard. Just two weeks before the disappearance of Sally McGrath the murderer, who was then working as a builder, convinced a 17-year-old girl to join him and a teenage apprentice on a boat ride. But once she got into the van he drove her to a stretch of woodland just 600 yards from where he would later bury Miss McGrath and violently raped the teenager, telling his workmate to 'come back in half an hour'. When the apprentice returned, Taylor was said to be 'back to his charming self' and even offered to buy the pair an ice cream. A fortnight after the rape, on the morning of July 11 1979, Sally McGrath said goodbye to her mother as she left her parents' house. It was the last time the 22-year-old was seen alive. Taylor had been subject to bail conditions for a burglary but had failed to report to a police station as instructed at 6pm on the night of Miss McGrath’s disappearance, the court heard. Ahead of the verdict Mr Khalil QC, prosecuting, had described the murder of Miss McGrath as 'the culmination of the defendant’s predatory traits' following a number of violent sexual assaults on young woman. He had urged jurors at the culmination of Taylor's eight week trial: 'You may well wonder why these offences were not prosecuted, or prosecuted more vigorously, closer to the time but it is your task to ensure justice is done now. 'This man has escaped justice for too long.'","Paul Taylor, now 60, was today jailed for life for brutally murdering Sally McGrath, 22, more than 30 years ago .

It seems the search for a new buddy for Today show host Matt Lauer is over - and the object of his 'bromance' is the 9am Hour's Willie Geist. As MailOnline revealed, NBC chiefs were looking for a male pal for the long-time anchor in a desperate bid to increase ratings. And the ailing morning program introduced the budding love affair today, with a bizarre four-minute segment dedicated to Geist swatting Lauer's bottom backstage. The show got Rossen Reports' Jeff . Rossen on the case, who declared: 'This kind of behavior happens all the . times between guys on football fields and huddles, but is it really . appropriate for the workplace?' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Odd: The Today Show aired a four-minute segment about Willie Geist, pictured left, swatting Matt Lauer, right, on the behind . He then studied surveillance footage of Geist caught in the act - from two angles. On the tape, the 9am Hour co-host is seen tapping Lauer on the derriere with a wad of papers. The pair then shake hands before Lauer reciprocates the butt-slap using his hand. In the 8.11am segment, Rossen interviewed both parties, with Lauer claiming the 'abandonment' he's felt since the incident was tough to deal with. 'Since it happened, he hasn't called, he hasn't written. Nothing,' Lauer said in the tongue-in-cheek report. The footage was shown several more times before the segment ended and both Geist and Lauer discussed the incident on the couch with Rossen and co-anchor Susannah Guthrie. Lauer has been left without a buddy beyond Al Roker since the departure of his best friend Bryant Gumbel from the Today show, which has prompted NBC chiefs to scout for a new buddy in a bid to boost ratings. 'Bromance': NBC chiefs last week revealed they wanted a new buddy for Lauer to boost ratings . Hit back: Lauer reciprocated the butt-slap as shown on this surveillance footage, pictured . The executives told MailOnline last week that they wanted to hark back to the chemistry Lauer, 54, found with Gumbel, 64, who left the show after 15 years as co-host in January 1997. They also were keen to rival the 'bromance' between Josh Elliot and Sam Champion on ABC's Good Morning America, which continues to outdo Today in the ratings stakes. Ahead of the arrival of Today's new executives Alexandra Wallace and Don Nash, a source told MailOnline: 'If you look at Josh Elliott and Sam Champion on Good Morning America, they are really great friends and that shines through on air - not since Matt and Bryant have we seen chemistry like this on morning TV.' There is no love lost between Lauer and Today's other senior male presenter Al Roker - who is close friends . with Ann Curry. All smiles: Matt Lauer and Willie Geist, pictured second from right and right, are having a 'bromance' Frosty: Matt Lauer and his wife Annette at the UNICEF Snowflake Ball at Cipriani 42nd Street in Manhattan last week . Ann, . 56, was unceremoniously axed in June after just a year as Today's . co-host, a move that has been blamed on Lauer, who last night made a . rare public appearance with his wife Annette at UNICEF's Snowflake Ball . in Manhattan. A senior TV source denied recent rumours that Lauer - who is on a staggering $25 million-a-year-deal - would be axed after Good Morning America took over Today's top spot in the ratings. The source, close to the Today show, said: 'Matt is on a huge deal, he's hugely important to NBC - he's not going anywhere.' Another source added: 'There is no chance in hell that Matt's getting fired. 'Of course, there are huge issues at Today and the big problem will be when the affiliates who pay all the money to air Today start complaining about ratings - they're never afraid to call a spade a spade. 'Every ratings point is worth millions in advertising revenue and Today knows it's not going to win its spot back overnight. 'We're waiting to see if Don Nash can do something bold. The consensus in the corridors at NBC is that Today desperately needs the right team. Best friends: Matt Lauer and former Today co-host Bryant Gumbel . Veteran: Bryant Gumbel and his wife Hilary Quinlan joined Matt and Annette Lauer at the Snowflake Ball last week . 'They need chemistry and the anchors need people to play with. 'Viewers like to see the presenters connecting, it's all about connectibility and there's no-one for Matt to banter with.' 'And when push comes to shove, viewers know nothing about Matt. Savannah Guthrie is super smart, but again, viewers know nothing about her. 'On GMA, people know that Sam's getting married, Josh talks all the time about his daughter, they're going through Robin Roberts' illness with her and Lara just doesn't stop talking! 'In effect, Today needs to find its 'secret sauce'. NBC chiefs are already trying out new talent on air. Geist has been moved to the 9am slot and is proving popular as a stand-in for Lauer, while other presenters are being trialled. Viewership for Good Morning America is . up three per cent so far this season, according to Nielsen ratings. Chemistry: GMA's Josh Elliott and Sam Champion on air together recently . Today is down . about 15 per cent. GMA has been averaging around 5.5 million viewers a show, while Today is averaging 5.3 million. Earlier this month, NBC announced Today's long-time executive producer Jim Bell - a good friend of Lauer - was being replaced by veteran news executives to take over the troubled morning programme. Nash, 47, a 23-year veteran of the show, is taking over as executive producer, and will be responsible for all four hours of Today. He started on Tuesday, and will report to Alexandra Wallace, who was promoted to the newly created role of executive in charge of the Today show. Wallace, 47, will continue as executive producer of NBC's prime time news programme, Rock Center with Brian Williams, which is also struggling and faces the axe, according to TV insiders. What's up Al: Today stars Savannah Guthrie and Matt Lauer share a joke with Scarlett Johansson last week - but Al Roker doesn't look so happy . Bryant Gumbel, who co-hosted Today alongside Katie Couric, acknowledged that he is 'best friends' with Lauer as he spoke out following Ann Curry's departure. He spoke out in Lauer's defence as he told the LA Times: 'I’m surprised and disappointed at this idea that Ann was a martyr, that she was thrown under the bus. 'I don’t know why she’s being portrayed as a modern-day Joan of Arc. In every job, in every walk of life, people are hired to do a job, and if they don't do it well they are relieved of that job.' The outspoken star added: 'It’s a big-boy business, and when things don’t work out, people are asked to leave. It’s happened to me; it’s happened to almost everyone in this business,; . Gumbel said he doesn’t watch Today, in keeping with a practice he began during his own run between 1982 and 1997, adding: 'I’m not a TV watcher and I’m not a morning-show watcher.' As for Savannah Guthrie, Gumbel added: 'Matt tells me she's a good person, and I believe him.'

"By . Becky Evans and James Slack . PUBLISHED: . 12:23 EST, 4 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:01 EST, 5 December 2012 . MI6 intelligence on counter- terrorism operations may have been stolen by a rogue Swiss official, it emerged last night. Security chiefs in the UK have been warned that hugely sensitive information they provided to the NDB, Switzerland’s spy agency,  could have been ‘compromised’. Hundreds of thousands of pages of classified documents were copied by a senior IT technician for the NDB, which he then copied for himself on to portable storage devices carrying them away in a backpack. Warned: The Secret Intelligence Service, based in London (pictured), was warned top secret information may have been compromised by the data theft . Swiss officials believe the suspect intended to sell the stolen data and have alerted both MI6 and America’s CIA. The information was shared between Britain, Switzerland and the United States and the CIA has also been warned about the risk. The technician, whose name has not been made public, was arrested by Swiss authorities last summer. He was later released from prison while a criminal investigation by the office of Switzerland's Federal Attorney General continues. A European security source said it is believed the IT worker became disgruntled when he felt his advice on operating the data systems was not being taken seriously. The technician downloaded hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of printed pages of classified material from the Swiss intelligence service's servers onto portable hard drives. He then carried them out of government buildings in a backpack. Investigators now believe warning signs were missed in the months leading to his arrest. The source said that the suspect became so disgruntled earlier this year that he stopped showing up for work. Share: MI6, headed by Sir John Sawers, pictured, regularly shares information with the CIA and Swiss intelligence service . He worked for the NDB - or Federal Intelligence Service, which is part of . Switzerland's Defense Ministry - for about eight years. He was described by one source as a ‘very talented’ technician. The worker also had ‘administrator rights’, which gave him unrestricted access to . most or all of the NDB's networks, including those holding vast caches . of secret data. Swiss . investigators seized portable storage devices containing the stolen data . after they arrested the suspect. The information was impounded before he had an opportunity to sell it. However, Swiss investigators could not be positive he did not manage to pass any of the information on before his arrest. Representatives of U.S. and British . intelligence agencies had no immediate response to detailed queries . about the case submitted by news agency Reuters. Swiss Attorney General Michael Lauber . and a senior prosecutor, Carolo Bulletti, announced in September they were investigating the data theft and its alleged perpetrator. A spokeswoman for the attorney general said she was prohibited by law from disclosing the suspect's identity. A spokesman for the NDB said he could not comment on the investigation. Security procedures and structures at the NDB, which was set up relatively recently, have now come under increased scrutiny. It conducts both foreign and domestic intelligence activities for the Swiss government. Danger: The CIA, based in Virginia (pictured), was warned secret information may have been compromised . Human resources staff are currently linked within the organisation to the agency's information technology division. This potentially made it difficult or confusing for the subdivision's personnel to investigate themselves, the source said. Despite warning signs, Swiss news reports say the NDB did not realise something was amiss until the largest Swiss bank, UBS, expressed . concern to authorities about a potentially suspicious attempt to set up a . new numbered bank account, which then was traced to the NDB technician. A Swiss parliamentary committee is now conducting its own investigation into the data theft and is expected to report next spring. Investigators are known to be concerned that the NDB lacks investigative powers, such as to search premises or conduct wiretaps, which are widely used by counter-intelligence investigators in other countries. News of the theft of intelligence data . surfaced with Switzerland's reputation for secrecy and discretion in . government and financial affairs already under assault. Swiss . authorities have been investigating, and in some cases have charged, . whistleblowers and some European government officials for using criminal . methods to acquire confidential financial data about suspected tax . evaders from Switzerland's traditionally secretive banks. One source said the CIA and MI6 routinely shared data on counter-terrorism and other issues with the NDB. The greatest danger would be the leaking of any information which could identify British agents or operations, though there is no suggestion this has happened.","Suspect walked out of Swiss intelligence service NDB with stolen data after becoming 'disgruntled' with his job .

Her Midas touch was credited with boosting the fortunes of Marks & Spencer earlier this week. Now Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, the Devon born model, has helped another British firm to beat the financial blues. Luxury fashion retailer Burberry, which has used Miss Huntington-Whiteley as both a model and ambassador around the world, cheered the City with a better than expected sales performance yesterday. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, the Devon born model, has helped Burberry to beat the financial blues with adverts such as this . Burberry's decision to pick the blonde as a model gave her an international profile and helped to win her first British Vogue cover in the same year . The 25-year-old was unveiled as the face of the new perfume brand the Burberry Body earlier this year, with marketing shots showing her wearing a trademark trench coat and nothing else. Earlier this week retail giant Marks and Spencer hailed the model’s luxury ‘Rosie’ lingerie range as a major success. Her underwear collection was the fastest selling in the group’s history and the one shining element from a set of distinctly grey  sales statistics from M&S. Miss Huntington-Whiteley’s relationship with Burberry has worked remarkably well for both parties since the fashion label’s chief creative director, Christopher Bailey, first picked her as the face of the brand in 2008. The decision gave the young blonde, who grew up on a farm in Tavistock, Devon, an international profile and helped to win her first British Vogue cover in the same year. The 25-year-old has maintained her ties with Burberry ever since and is now considered one the world’s most sought after and highest paid models. While her fame also opened the door . to acting roles in the third Transformers film and the new version of . Mad Max, which is currently in production. Explaining . the decision to choose her to front the Burberry Body fragrance . campaign, Mr Bailey said: ‘Rosie’s effortless style and her staggering . beauty made her the natural choice.’ Miss Huntington-Whiteley, who was raised on a farm in Devon, has been credited for a boost in sales for Marks and Spencer after she launched her underwear brand for the chain . The global economic slowdown has caught up with luxury brands in the past year with sales failing to grow in line with expectations. In Britain, both Burberry and Mulberry have suffered at time when even the burgeoning middle classes in China have scaled back their purchases of international designer labels. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Christopher Bailey, who directed the famous 'Body' advert, pictured at the Burberry flagship store opening ceremony at Pacific Place in Hong Kong, China . However, Burberry yesterday announced underlying profits for the six months to the end of September were up by six per cent year on a year ago to £173million. This was ahead of City expectations of around £162m. The group, which is best known for its signature camel, red and black check pattern, said total sales were up eight per cent to £883 million. Its profit margin was also up slightly because it was selling more products at the top end of its luxury price bracket. Burberry has decided to bring its beauty products and fragrance business, which had previously been farmed out to a third party, back under the control of the company. This will involve paying a hefty fee of some £145million. The firm hopes the Burberry Body fragrance and the association with the British model will be a huge money spinner in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. Chief executive, Angela Ahrendts, said: ‘We see huge potential in this category,’ adding that the products would be presented in a way that was ‘much more linked into the fashion calendar’. Stacey Cartwright, the chief financial officer, said the fragrances and beauty products are important because they offer women a relatively affordable introduction to the brand. A small 35ml bottle of the Burberry Body eau de toilette sells for £39. It is also expecting strong sales of its new version of The Orchard bag, as seen on the arms of A-list celebrities such as Sarah Jessica Parker and Emma Stone. A Nubuck leather option comes in at £1,295. Retail analyst, Kate Calvert, of Seymour Pierce, described the sales figures and profits as ‘reassuring’, while she predicted strong long-term growth.","Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was named face of the Burberry Body campaign earlier this year .

The Christmas party season has begun and Premier League footballers are already embroiled in trouble after Andy Carroll allegedly assaulted a photographer outside a nightclub. West Ham were the first to get their festive celebrations in full swing as the players went on a weekend tour to Dublin following Saturday’s 3-1 win over Chelsea. But Carroll, who is ruled out for eight weeks with a knee ligament injury, reportedly went berserk at snapper Paddy Cummins after he attempted to photograph the crocked England international leaving a popular nightspot without a leg brace he had been wearing earlier in the evening. West Ham have released a statement backing the on-loan Liverpool striker amid the allegations and Carroll's team-mates are also ready to back him over the claims. Night out: Andy Carroll and Kevin Nolan were part of West Ham's Christmas party weekend tour to Dublin, where they were pictured with Irish fans . 'Andy Carroll was in Dublin as part of a social trip with full permission of the management team,' a West Ham spokesman said: . 'Andy agreed to have a number of . pictures taken at the request of a photographer who was waiting on the . street. 'Despite this, the photographer then carried on taking photos in . the close proximity of Andy and was politely asked to stop by the . private security team working on the trip. 'When he then continued taking more photos he was restrained by the security team for Andy’s safety. 'Eyewitnesses state at no point was there any physical contact between Andy and the photographer. 'The Garda took statements from the group back at the hotel and no further action was taken.' Cummins, who is 5ft 8in, claims the 6ft . 3in on-loan Liverpool striker gouged his right eye while trying to grab . his camera. Cummins also claims the former Newcastle star went to bite him after knocking him to the floor. The 33-year-old photographer was later admitted to hospital, where he offered a statement to the police. ‘He was like a wild animal,’ Cummins told The Sun. Meal deal: Carroll - seemingly without his protective leg brace on - is pictured ordering food from Burger King at the end of his night out . Injured: Carroll was wearing a protective knee brace on Saturday at Upton Park . ‘I felt this terrible pain in my eye as he gouged me. ‘I was screaming, “My eyes!” but he kept it up. The pain was incredible.’ A spokesman for the Garda press office in Dublin said officers received a report of an incident at 2.30am yesterday. Officers at the city's Pearse Street station are investigating the incident. It is understood members of the West Ham football team were spoken to by gardai following reports of an assault. No arrests were made, the Garda spokesman said. Carroll’s agent Mark Curtis, who is . also the representative for Hammers boss Sam Allardyce, declined to . comment over the alleged assault. Speaking about the disappearance of . the leg brace he said: ‘The leg brace was outside his trousers inside . the club because he wanted people to see it so they wouldn’t knock into . him. When he left he put it under the trousers. ‘He can’t walk without it. He isn’t a daft lad and he wouldn’t be able to put weight on his leg without it. 'You can see from the shape of his trousers in the picture [published in The Sun] that it’s underneath.' Allardyce’s side were staying at the . five-star Fitzwilliam Hotel and kicked-off their weekend in the Irish . capital’s Grafton Lounge before visiting the popular Coppers nightspot. Spell on the sidelines: Carroll is out for eight weeks with a knee injury . Carroll was one of several first-team . Hammers’ players spotted by fans at the Quays pub in Temple Bar in the . early hours of Sunday morning said to be downing pints of Guinness and . Jagerbombs. According to the report in The Sun, Carroll refused to discuss the alleged spat with the photographer and insisted he’d had a ‘great night’. West Ham told the newspaper that snapper Cummins was ‘restrained’ by security staff outside the nightclub in question but denied contact with the striker.

It's the age-old tradition that has sparked a thousand festive romances and led to many ill-advised post-office Christmas party flings. And in spite of this year's wet weather, it's time to pucker up again this year as a bumper crop of mistletoe went under the hammer at a unique auction earlier today. More than a thousand lots of the season's most popular aphrodisiac were up for grabs as hundreds of wholesalers, retailers and no doubt a few people hoping for some festive flirting this year converged on Tenbury Wells for the town's annual mistletoe auction. The auction is part of the town's mistletoe season and festival which runs from late November until Christmas. Pucker up: A bumper crop of mistletoe and holly went under the hammer at Tenbury Wells today . Crop: 1,200 lots of mistletoe were up for grabs at the auction which is held three times a year the England's 'Mistletoe Town' Foliage: Buyers check out this year's crop of mistletoe which had been under threat from poor weather . Bidding war: The auction is open to wholesalers, retailers and general members of the public hoping for a festive flirt . The Worcestershire town - sat right at the heart of the UK's mistletoe country and known as the nation's 'Mistletoe Town' - holds the auctions on the last Tuesday of every November and the first two Tuesdays of December. Today's bidders had 1,200 lots of mistletoe, 3,000 wreaths and 250 Christmas trees to bid for today, despite this year's crop being threatened by poor weather and affecting some of the foliage. The crop was blessed by druids who also performed a ceremonial march before the auction got under way. According to auctioneer Nick Champion's website, stocks of mistletoe are often snapped up for use on cruise ships and at wedding receptions. Amorous: One buyer bagged bunches of the parasite, traditionally favoured by kissing couples at this time of year . Tradition: The mistletoe, holly and Christmas trees were all blessed by druids before the auction started . Heart of mistletoe country: Some buyers travelled hundreds of miles to visit the auction at Tenbury Wells . The Mistletoe Festival was set up in 2004 when the traditional auctions, held in the town for more than 100 years came under threat. The town is perfectly positioned to host the auction - mistletoe mainly grows in the UK around the south west Midlands in Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Gloucestershire and Somerset. It is a parasite which can only grow on tree branches. It grows on a variety of tree types but particularly favours apple trees. As well as being popular at this time of year among kissing couples, mistletoe has been touted for it's health benefits in recent years, with experts announcing today that it could be useful in the fight against colon cancer. Pucker up: Couples traditionally enjoy a kiss under the mistletoe at this time of year . It's not certain where the tradition of kissing under the mistletoe actually originates but its connection to Christmas is likely to have something to do with the druids. They believed that mistletoe could perform miracles and protect people from witches. It was also believed to help both animals and humans become more fertile. Each year, druids held a special ceremony in late December or early January where they would take mistletoe from oak trees and give it to people to put in their homes to stave off evil spirits. It is said to have become part of Christmas tradition in the Victorian era thanks to an historical fascination with druids. The tradition of kissing under the mistletoe could originate in Viking legend. Vikings often told the story of how one of their gods - Balder - died when he was poisoned by mistletoe. His mother Frigga is said to have brought him back to life after three days and promptly celebrated by kissing everyone who walked under the mistletoe thereafter. It is also said to have been believed at one stage that kissing under the mistletoe would lead to marriage. Nowadays it is hung in people's doorways around the festive season and couples who pass under it are supposed to kiss. If done properly, the man should remove one of the mistletoe's berries after the kiss.","Buyers converged on Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire, for the annual mistletoe auction .

The owner of British fashion chain Topshop is reportedly in talks to sell a quarter of his stake to the private equity firm that also backs J Crew. Topshop owner Sir Phillip Green is thought to be looking to sell such a large portion of the company so that he can raise more than $400million. That money will then go towards expanding the already-growing Topshop empire and opening more stores in America and venturing into China. Selling: Sir Phillip Green is thought to be selling a quarter of his stake in the £1billion Topshop empire . Similar styles: The owner of British fashion chain Topshop is reportedly in talks to sell a quarter of his stake to the private equity firm that also backs J Crew . The British magnate is reportedly in talks with Los Angeles-based private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners LP which has backed a number of successful fashion franchises in the past. In spite of their similar names, the heads of Leonard Green have no relation to Sir Green, though they will both stand to profit significantly if a multi-million dollar deal is reached. Leonard Green, and fellow private equity firm TPG Capital LP, partnered up in 2010 and bought J Crew for $3billion. All told, Topshop and Topman is collectively valued at £1billion, which equates to roughly $1.61billion. If the deal goes through, this will not be Sir Phillip’s first time turning to Americans for some help for his British brands. Last month he signed up American reality TV stars the Kardashian sisters in an attempt to boost the fortunes of his Dorothy Perkins chain. Investment: The retail tycoon is thought to want to raise the money to expand his fashion chain into China and the U.S. Topshop, and male offshoot Topman, have become a staple in the British fashion world and was helped largely by a popular collaboration that it promoted with model Kate Moss. The launch of her line in 2007 saw the biggest single day of trading Topshop.com had ever seen. The chain has also been hailed for its skill in spotting the latest fashion trends and quickly getting them on to its shelves. The business has 615 franchised outlets operating in 39 countries, three of which are in America. If the new deal is successful it could transform Topshop into a truly global brand. Topshop already has stores open in New York, Chicago and Las Vegas, with a fourth slated to open in Los Angeles next spring. British retailers are mostly struggling as consumers hold back spending in the face of job insecurity, rising prices, subdued wage growth and government austerity measures. The entrepreneur recently criticised Britain’s battered retailers for feeling sorry for themselves, saying there was ‘no use moping about’ and they should ‘get on with it’. Vision: J Crew, which is largely run by designer Jenna Lyons, was bought by the private equity firm in 2010 for $3billion . Deal: Sir Philip Green, pictured with daughter Chloe, is in talks to sell a substantial stake in his successful Topshop and Topman business . Arcadia posted a 25 per cent year-on-year rise in underlying profit to $269million in the year to August 25. Sir Phillip’s family is already estimated to be worth more than £3billion and they benefit greatly from a close watch of tax liabilities. Arcadia is registered as the property of his wife Tina who lives in Monaco,  so the company does not pay tax  in the UK. In 2005 Sir Philip was criticised for taking a £1billion dividend out of Arcadia – one of the biggest payouts ever seen from a company to an individual in the UK. Critics claimed the payout was channelled through a network of offshore accounts, saving Sir Philip, and costing the taxpayer, close to £300million. Sir Philip is expected to conclude discussions Tuesday and make an announcement Wednesday. The landmark deal would provide him with partners who know the U.S. retail market and could help with any expansion plans.

Nasa plans to follow up its Mars rover Curiosity mission with a duplicate rover that could collect and store samples for return to Earth, the agency's lead scientist said. The new rover will use spare parts and engineering models developed for Curiosity, which is four months into a planned $2.5billion mission on Mars to look for habitats that could have supported microbial life. Replicating the rover's chassis, sky-crane landing system and other gear will enable NASA to cut the cost of the new mission to about $1.5billion including launch costs, John Grunsfeld, the U.S. space agency's associate administrator for science, said at the American Geophysical Union conference in San Francisco. Scroll down for video . Twin brother: The new rover, launching in 2020 will look . similar to Curiosity, pictured in a computer generated image, and be built from spare parts and engineering . models from the rover currently on Mars . Budget shortfalls forced NASA to pull out of a series of joint missions with Europe, designed to return rock and soil samples from Mars in the 2020s. Europe instead will partner with Russia for the launch vehicle and other equipment that was to have been provided by NASA. Mr Grunsfeld said NASA will provide a key organics experiment for Europe's ExoMars rover, as well as engineering and mission support under the agency's proposed budget for the year beginning October 1, 2013. The U.S. also will provide the radio communications equipment for a planned European orbiter slated to launch in 2016. Details about what science instruments would be included on the new rover, whether or not it would have a cache for samples, and the landing site have not yet been determined. NASA plans to set up a team of scientists to refine plans for the rover and issue a solicitation next summer.

Sample collection: Details about what science instruments would be included on the new rover, whether or not it would have a cache for samples, and the landing site have not yet been determined . The Mars rover Curiosity has completed its first chemical test of soil from the red planet, and scientists say there are no surprises so far. The spacecraft is on a mission to look for ingredients in Martian soil and rocks that could support life. But in the first scoop of soil analysed, there were no definitive signs of the chemical building blocks of life. 'We have no definitive detection of Martian organics at this point, but we will keep looking in the diverse environments of Gale Crater,' said SAM Principal Investigator Paul Mahaffy of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Instead, the six-wheel rover detected water and a mix of other chemicals. A comment by mission's chief scientist two weeks ago led to speculation that Curiosity had dug up carbon-based organics, considered an essential ingredient for life. The National Academy of Sciences last year ranked a Mars sample return mission as its top priority in planetary science for the next decade. 'The (science) community already has come forward with a very clear message about what the content of the next Mars surface mission should be, and that is to cache the samples that will come back to Earth,' said Steve Squyres with Cornell University. 'That's really a necessary part of having this mission,' he said. NASA had considered flying an orbiter in 2018, but decided instead to provide equipment for the European probes, extend its ongoing Mars missions and develop the Curiosity twin rover for launch in 2020. 'We could have come up with something in 2018, but with the budget that we're in we would not have had such a full program. 'It would have been a down-scaled orbiter of some kind,' Mr Grunsfeld said. A photo taken by Curiosity from the surface of Mars: The new rover also would help NASA prepare for eventual human missions to Mars, a long-term objective of the U.S. space program . Under the revamped Mars plan, Curiosity's two-year mission would be extended to five years. The new rover also would help NASA prepare for eventual human missions to Mars, a long-term objective of the U.S. space program. 'If we think of the 2030s as the potential for human exploration, I think this 2020 rover and the other things we might be able to do in the 2020s as a synergistic collaboration between science and human spaceflight. 'There are a lot of cool things we can do,' Mr Grunsfeld said.","Duplicate rover to be made from spare parts and engineering model left over from Curiosity .

Unfortunately for his neighbours, that’s exactly what they got. Happy birthday: Ollie Boorman, left, said seeing Alesha Dixon at his party was 'crazy' and said the event was  the 'best night ever' More than 1,000 revellers – including . Britain’s Got Talent judge Alesha Dixon – packed into his parents’ garden before spilling out into the street. But while the party-goers in the village of Tewin, Hertfordshire, had a good time, neighbours were less impressed. Police were called amid reports of thefts, smashed cars and fighting. They launched a major operation, which . included closing a nearby road because of congestion caused by the . number of cars arriving. Out of control: Revellers turned up from as far away as Manchester to the party in Hertfordishire . Party: More than 1,000 people crowded into the Ollie Boorman's street after he advertised his birthday on Facebook .

Packed: Ollie Boorman said he expected about 200 people to turn up and was left shocked when five times that many arrived . They finally halted the party at 11pm, three hours after it started. Boorman – whose parents were away in Dubai – is now counting the cost after he was charged with causing a public nuisance. The day after the night before: The scene after the house party where Ollie Boorman held his 21st and over 1,000 people turned up . He admitted the offence at St Albans .

He was also ordered to . pay £500 compensation to Hertfordshire Police and £85 costs. The court heard the computer engineer admitted the party, which his brother James, 18, also attended, had got ‘way out of hand’. But he dismissed concerns after the court appearance, hailing it ‘the best night ever’. ‘It was a really good atmosphere. No . one was getting into any trouble,’ he said. ‘At first when all these . strangers showed up me and my brother were a bit worried. But everyone . was really chilled out and it was really fun so we started having a good . time. ‘It was crazy when Alesha showed up. She said thanks for letting her come and told me it was a great party. She said she couldn’t believe how many people were there.’ Boorman added his parents Karen, 49, . who works for John Lewis, and father Clive, 52, a salesman, gave their . blessing for the event so long as any mess was ‘kept outside’. ‘We tidied up.

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . PUBLISHED: . 10:07 EST, 29 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:52 EST, 30 November 2012 . Budget airline Ryanair has imposed a new blanket £6 a head ‘website administration fee’ on its customers - plus a 2 per cent booking fee on those who pay by credit card. Customers who pay by credit card face the double-whammy of having to pay BOTH charges, the no-frills airline confirmed. But Ryanair flew into a major row by claiming that the moves had been forced on it by UK competition watchdogs at the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) - a charge which they vociferously denied. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, will impose a new 2 per cent credit card processing fee on all new bookings made from Friday (file picture) The OFT criticised Ryanair for 'springing' on extra charges. Pictured, Ryanair fees before the fee change . Until now, passengers booking Ryanair tickets with either a credit card OR a debit card faced a £6 ‘admin fee’ unless they paid with the airline’s special pre-paid ‘Ryanair Cash Passport’. But the OFT ruled in July that this was unfair and that debit card customers should not pay an admin fee unless it is shown in the headline price. There should be no extra charge for paying debit card. So in retaliation, Ryanair says everyone will now pay the £6 admin fee – and credit card customers will in addition pay a new 2% booking charge. And it sought to blame the OFT for the added costs. It means a  family booking by credit card faces its costs soar. The row erupted when the Irish no-frills carrier announced it was  bringing in a new  2 per cent credit card processing fee on all new credit card bookings made from Friday. It also announced that from Friday its passengers would also have to pay a £6 administration fee to cover the airline's ‘website costs’. The airline claimed it was making the announcement  ’in order to comply with the UK Office of Fair Trading's recent ruling on credit card fees’. Ryanair said later it  was ‘disappointed, but not surprised’  by the OFT’s ‘attempt to distance themselves from their anti-consumer rulings.’ It then cheekily  ‘invited the OFT to pay these increases on the passengers’ behalf.’ Ryanair’s Stephen McNamara said: ’Ryanair is disappointed, but not surprised, by the OFT’s attempt to distance themselves from their anti-consumer rulings. 'Before the OFT imposed these baseless changes, airlines could partner with card providers to allow their cardholders the exclusive advantage of avoiding such fees. ‘As the OFT has removed our ability to help passengers avoid fees through exclusive partnerships perhaps they may wish to pay these fees on the consumers’ behalf.’ But a furious Office of Fair Trading (OFT) issued a strong denial saying this was absolutely not the case and that the extra charge was totally unnecessary. However, the move came as Ryanair WAS forced by the competition watchdogs to scrap unfair charges on debit cards and to remove a lack of transparency in the booking process which saw unfair charges ‘sprung’ on  passengers at the last minute. But the OFT insisted: ‘We have not required any airline to introduce new payment charges, increase their credit card charges or scrap any discounts they wish to offer.’ The OFT added: ‘We took action to make sure that debit card charges are included in the headline price and credit card charges are transparent and not sprung on shoppers towards the end of the booking process.’ Ryanair will also introduce an across the board £6 administration fee (file picture) Those using Ryanair's ‘cash passport’  scheme in Ireland, Germany and Spain will be able to avoid administration fees until February 1, February 15 and March 21 2013 respectively. In July the OFT told 12 airlines, including Ryanair that they could not charge a fee to customers paying with debit cards, which were considered the same as cash. At the time Ryanair charged a £6 card fee per person per booking, it said. Nor could they allow only their own debit cards to be used. Ryanair defended its actions and said it was continuing to ‘deliver the lowest fares and a no-fuel surcharges guarantee to all our passengers', and that ‘passengers could avoid credit card fees by paying with a debit card.’ Ryanair’s Stephen McNamara, said: ‘To cover our credit card processing costs and to comply with the UK OFT’s recent ruling, we are introducing a 2% credit card handling fee from 30 November 2012.‘ . He said Ryanair’s ‘avoidable’ 2% credit card fee can be avoided by using debit cards (including Ryanair Cash Passport cards) or German ELV transfer. A Ryanair statement noted: ’In addition, Ryanair’s €6/£6 admin fee (which covers costs associated with Ryanair’s website, www.ryanair.com) will apply to all new bookings made from 30 November, except those bookings made using a Ryanair Cash Passport in Ireland, Germany and Spain, where admin fees can be avoided until 1 February, 15 February and 21 March 2013, respectively. ‘ . To rub in the message, Ryanair insisted: ‘This will bring all of Ryanair’s European operations in line with its UK procedures, following the OFT’s ruling.' Ryanair and its outspoken chief executive Michael O’Leary has already come under fire from consumer groups and aviation watchdogs for luring customers in with low fares then charging sky-high fees for ‘the extras’ - and has even threatened to charge for use of the toilets. Mr O’Leary admitted to Management Today magazine: 'Of course I fly Ryanair, but it costs me a fortune in excess baggage.’ In July this year Ryanair and 11 other airline companies were told they could not charge a fee to customer paying by debit card (file picture) But the opinionated airline chief has no sympathy for other passengers who fall foul of his tightly drawn rules. Recalling the recent case of passenger and mother-of-two Suzy McLeod, who received backing from nearly half a million Facebook users when she was forced to pay £236 to print boarding passes for her family so they could fly home to Britain from Alicante, Spain. Mr O’Leary told ‘Management Today: ‘Recently a customer turned up at Alicante with no boarding passes for her family. 'She was fined €60 for each reissue. So she gets on 'the Twitter' to complain. 'Emboldened by the rising tide of support, Mrs McLeod asks for compensation, to which we replied politely but firmly, thank you, Mrs McLeod, but it was your f*** up. We're not changing our policy.’ The mother-of-two, from Newbury, Berkshire had criticised Ryanair’s rule that travellers must print boarding passes up to two weeks before flying, or face a £60 per ticket charge at the airport. At the time of the boarding card row  Mr O’Leary launched an astonishing rant  against his own customers - branding those who don’t like paying for their boarding cards as 'idiots' who should ‘b***** off’. Passengers who arrive for flights without a boarding pass are ‘stupid’ and should pay a penalty to have one printed at the check-in desk because it is their ‘f*** up’. On its website the airline carries a table of what it terms ‘optional’ fees and another saying ‘click here to see how to avoid paying optional fees.’","Ryanair will bring in a new 2 per cent credit card processing fee tomorrow .

'On the way back I was on the phone with my mother and I told her I'd seen his vehicle and she said ""no just stay in the car"" and I said ""I'm not waiting, I'm not waiting,"" and went and checked out his vehicle.' Though he was covered in blood, she held out hope tha he was still alive. 'I thought he still had a pulse. I held his head, and I told him it was going to be OK, and that I loved him and that help was on the way,' she said. Once paramedics arrived on the scene, he was pronounced dead. Heartbroken: Ashley last heard from David when he was on the way home from work and he said that he was having a 'problem' with two fellow customers at the gas station but did not elaborate . Vehicle: When he didn't arrive home shortly after the call, Ashley got nervous and retraced his steps, during which she found his abandoned Chevy Blazer (seen here) Police are now retracing the timeline of events in hopes that they can find witnesses to what they believe was a car-to-car shooting. Local news site AL.com reports that Mr DeRoncey finished his shift as the manager of Game Stop but stayed later to complete his tasks. Timeline: Police believe David, 28, was shot in a car-to-car incident around 7pm on Saturday . He then kept up his daily routine of stopping at the Shell gas station on Oxmoor Road on his way home where he called his wife. He said that he was having problems with two people at the store, and at one point he put her on hold to deal with the issue. When he restarted the conversation, he said that everything was fine and did not elaborate further. After he did not immediately arrive home, Ashley became concerned and tried calling him repeatedly. She even reached out to their friends, posting on Facebook for anyone to contact her if she had heard from him in the past four hours. She left the house to go look for him at around 7.30pm, though it seems she did not discover the abandoned blue Chevy Blazer with his dead body inside until later. 'We're very surprised that no one called in, that the vehicle sat there for four hours before his wife found him,' homicide Sgt. Scott Thurmond said at the press conference. 'It was a holiday weekend, travelers were returning back to home and even in just normal interstate traffic that was a busy area.' The couple dated for seven years before getting married this July, and the reality of the situation does not appear to have sunk in. ‘Blood all over me, holding his head telling him to hold on im here helps on the way. Never in my life. Finding your husband your best friend like that is so,..........i miss you,’ she wrote on Facebook the morning after he was discovered. 'Best friend: Ashley is now planning her husband's funeral, just four months after their wedding (right) Ashley was flanked by her relatives during the emotional press conference, and she has been organizing his funeral arrangements so that it fits with his personality. She has encouraged friends to host car shows in his memory and blast their sound systems when they drive to the burial via police escort. ‘I’m calling all bassheads!

Mitt Romney made his first step towards shaping his post-campaign career as he officially re-joined the board of directors of Marriott hotels. The decision to re-enter the world of corporate management comes as little surprise, as Romney made his name in venture capitalism, and he has a very strong family connection to the Marriotts. The hotel chain was started by J.W. Marriott, a fellow Mormon who was very close with Mitt's father George. Back in the public eye: Mitt and Ann Romney took their grandchildren to Disneyland on November 20 . Low key: Family outings, like the one to Disneyland (left) or to get gas (right) have been common of late, but his latest decision to rejoin the Marriott board is the first career move he has made . Mitt served on the board of the company from 1993 to 2002 when he resigned to serve as governor of Massachusetts. He rejoined the board in 2009 and resigned again in January 2011 as the campaign heated up with the seemingly-unending process of Republican primaries. 'It is an honor to once again be able to serve in the company of leaders like Bill Marriott and Arne Sorenson and to support the work of the tens of thousands of Marriott associates who make Marriott International the renowned success that it is,' Romney said in a statement released announcing the board position on Monday according to CNN. Board members receive an annual salary of $60,000 as well as $110,000 in company stock as compensation for their efforts. The former presidential candidate has laid low ever since he lost the election, relaxing with his family in La Jolla, California and taking time out to see the latest edition of the Twilight saga and accompanying his grandchildren to Disneyland. Romney briefly popped back up on the . political radar when he had lunch with President Obama in the White . House last week, though he did not speak to reporters after the meeting . and only one joint photo was released. Back in the hotel business: Romney has served on the Marriott Board of Directors on-and-off since 1993 . Verbally proud: J.W. Marriott Jr., of the hotel magnate family, praised Mitt and Ann Romney during church on Sunday . Long-time friends: This undated photo shows Lenore Romney (center), Mitt's mother, and Mrs J. Willard Marriott together. The couples were so close that Mitt (whose first name is Willard) is named after the elder Mr Marriott . It comes as no surprise that the company would welcome Romney back with open arms, as billionaire J.W. Marriott Jr. praised the presidential candidate for bringing positive attention to their shared religion during a church service in September. 'There has never been as much positive attention to the church, thanks to the wonderful campaign of Mitt Romney and his family,' the 80-year-old J.W. Marriott Jr. said at a Sunday service at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in New Hampshire. Friends in hand: Nancy Marriott handed her umbrella to Ann Romney as she walked into the service at Wolfeboro, New Hampshire . Happy to see you: Once inside, Nancy's husband J.W. Marriott Jr praised the Romneys and what their openness has done for the public perception of Mormonism . 'That's a great tribute to Mitt and Ann and their family for living such an exemplary life,' he said. 'Now that we're out of obscurity, everybody is looking at us and saying, ""Are you as good as the Romneys?""' The former Massachusetts governor and hotel magnate have been close friends, as were generations of their family. Mitt's father, George Romney, was in . fact so close to J.W. Jr's father J.

Happier times: Douglas Quinn allegedly beat Elizabeth, seen here at a 2009 event, while they were on a trip to New York earlier this month . The home of the soccer boss who was arrested for allegedly beating up his wife was featured on a home makeover show where the lead decorator singled out issues in the couple’s bedroom. Douglas Quinn was arrested on November 10 when he was charged by the NYPD for allegedly attacking his wife Elizabeth and suffocating her until she passed out while they were on a weekend trip to Manhattan. The Quinns are based in Dallas, Texas and their mansion was featured on Bravo’s reality show ‘Million Dollar Decorator’ as host Kathryn Ireland attempted to redo her ‘friends’ home. Though it is unclear when exactly the episode that aired on Wednesday November 28 was shot, Ms Ireland introduces the project explaining: ‘They've just moved here and I totally helped them redo it’. Mr Quinn, who has two daughters, was hired by FC Dallas as the president and CEO of the club in 2010, so their recent move must have been within the city. Looking at the decorations, Ms Ireland likened the wood panelling to the scene of a fire, even though the true sparks flew when the couple went to New York to celebrate his 50th birthday and stayed at the Alex Hotel in midtown. More romantic: Ms Ireland put a map of Paris above their bed to remind them of their honeymoon . ‘In the master bedroom, my big objective . here was to paint out all of that terrible wood. Frankly to me it . looked like there'd been a fire. So we painted all of that out . immediately,’ Ms Ireland said in the show. A slideshow of photos shows how the decorator decided to paint over a good deal of the home’s dark wood panelling to give a lighter look. In one of the girl’s bedrooms, Ms Ireland used a canopy bed to create a whimsical feel. Bold entrance: The Dallas house features a wishing well right near the front door . When it came to personal touches for . the couple’s lovenest, she looked back at the couple’s romantic history . and put a map of Paris above their bed as it was the city where they . spent their honeymoon. ‘We found this great map and I think what drew both Liz and Doug to it was that it was Paris,’ Ms Ireland said in the segment. ‘They want to feel that they've been part of this journey with you. I'm so so happy with the way it's turned out.’ Even though the renovation of the home may be done, the same cannot be said for the couple’s legal problems, as the football club announced two weeks ago that Doug would be taking ‘an indefinite leave of absence from the club to attend to personal matters.’ The 6ft 5in boss was arrested on charges of assault and strangulation at around 4pm on the Saturday afternoon. Mrs Quinn, who was taken to New York Hospital and treated for injuries to her face, arm, legs and eye at the weekend, told the New York Post: 'We had a lovely night, and unfortunately things went wrong,' she said, adding that the couple - who have two children - plan to stay together. Police sources told the newspaper Quinn allegedly hit his wife repeatedly, choked her using both hands, before holding a pillow over her face until she passed out. Party: Quinn is accused of attacking his wife at the luxury Alex hotel in Manhattan on Saturday, where the couple were staying after the FC Dallas boss' 50th birthday party the night before . Quinn was arrested and later released on $20,000 bail following his arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court.

Richard Dale Stokley was executed today for the 1991 murder and rape of two 13-year-old girls in an Arizona ghost town where they were raped, strangled and stabbed before being dumped in a partly flooded mine shaft . An inmate was executed today after being convicted of murdering two 13-year-old girls in a ghost town where they were raped, strangled and stabbed before being dumped in a partly flooded mine shaft. Richard Dale Stokley, 60, was put to death at a prison in Florence two decades after he and another man were convicted of murdering Mandy Meyers and Mary Snyder in 1991 in rural Cochise County. At 10am today, the execution team ran into difficulty setting the intravenous lines, so had to cut into an artery at the top of his leg/groin area to insert them. He did not die until 11.12am because of the difficulty finding a vein in which to administer the cocktail of drugs. Stokley had no formal last words but earlier expressed regret while speaking with members of the execution team during the lengthy setup time. 'I do wish that I could die doing something meaningful, you know, this seems like such a waste,' Stokely said. At 6pm, he had his last meal of porterhouse steak, french fries, okra, cauliflower, salad, fruit and ice cream. He did not look in the direction of the witnesses when the curtain was pulled. Mother of one of the girls Patty Hancock told The Republican: 'He was a coward from the beginning and he died a coward. He never looked at us.' After the execution, the sister of victim Mary Snyder said she resented Stokley and lamented that her young sister had been killed. 'She never got to learn how to drive. She never got to go to high school. She never went to prom, and she never met my kids,' Elisha Gonzales said. The execution of Stokley was Arizona's 34th since 1992. Daniel Cook was put to death on August 8 in Arizona's most recent execution. U.S. Supreme Court rulings cleared the way for the lethal injection given to Stokley. On Tuesday, it denied two appeals on his behalf and declined without comment to block his execution. In his final appeals, Stokley's lawyers said he was entitled to a new hearing on sentencing evidence. They also said his constitutional rights were violated because the other man convicted in the case is free after serving 20 years in prison. Prosecutors said the Arizona Supreme Court adequately considered evidence on possible leniency for Stokley. The abandoned mine near Elfrida, Arizona, where the bodies of Mandy Meyers and Mary Snyder were found in July, 1991 . Prosecutors also defended the disparity in sentences by saying the other man negotiated a plea agreement. The girls were killed after they left a July 4th holiday weekend community campout in Elfrida, saying they were going to a restroom. They never returned, instead going with Stokley and Randy Brazeal to the nearby ghost town, authorities said. Acting Cochise County Sheriff Rod Rothrock, who was the lead detective on the case, said in a recent interview that circumstances of how the girls went with the men were never determined. Stokley, who was 38 when the girls were killed, was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder. He also was convicted of sexual assault against a minor. Brazeal, who was 19 when the girls were killed, was released from prison July 2, 2011, after serving his full 20-year sentence. While Stokley said both men participated in the slayings, Brazeal denied involvement in the killings. However, he pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, avoiding a trial that the then-county attorney feared could result in an acquittal because DNA evidence was not yet ready. Stokley has said he thought his life was worth saving, that he knew he had made 'grave and irreversible errors' and that he was sorry he 'was mixed up in these awful events that brought me to this'. He also said he was sorry for the victims and their families. But he recently declined to ask the state clemency board to recommend that the governor either delay his execution or commute his death sentence in prison. A clemency request would be futile because the board hadn't shown mercy to other death-row inmates, he told the board in a handwritten letter. 'I don't want to put anyone through that, especially since I'm convinced that ... it's pointless,' he wrote. 'I reckon I know how to die, and if it's my time, I'll go without fanfare.'","Richard Dale Stokley had a last meal of porterhouse steak, french fries, okra, cauliflower, salad, fruit and ice cream .

"87% of Debenhams customers prefer star as tree topper with just 9% favouring the traditional angel . By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 08:49 EST, 4 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:07 EST, 4 December 2012 . The angel once held prime position at the top of the nation's Christmas tree, only to be recently outshone by the vibrant star. But now, department store Debenhams are pledging to restore the angel to all its glory at the top of the nation's Christmas trees. The campaign has been launched following the revelation that the star is the most popular tree topper, with 87 per cent of customers favouring it over the traditional angel. Debenhams is pledging to bring the angel back after star becomes a more popular Christmas tree topper . And only 4 per cent of shoppers choose the poor fairy, a character that didn’t actually feature in the nativity. Spokesperson for Debenhams Ed Watson said: 'The Christmas angel signifies everything wholesome and dignified about Christmas – it is as equally important to the nativity as the star and deserves to be celebrated as such. Debenhams believe that the angel symbolises the true meaning of Christmas . 'The angel signifies the true meaning of the festive period and is a way of reminding us as to what Christmas is really about. In this respect the tree topper is more important than the presents underneath. 'We are calling for our customers to save a dying tradition of putting the Arch Angel Gabriel on top of your tree this festive season.' The angel has been a topper for Christmas trees since the early 18th century, in Germany, when trees were first brought into the home and decorated. Debenhams sell both tree toppers, the angel is £10 while the star is £8, but they have upped their buy of angels in a hope to return them to the top of the tree . The star is a much more recent addition, not being used until in the early 19th century. The Christmas tree didn’t reach Britain until later in the 19th century and both stars and angels were used. The fairy has only crept to the top of the tree in the last 30 years. Ed Watson added: 'We have upped our buy of angels this year as a hope to end the star’s monopoly over Christmas tree toppers and make the angel as celebrated as it once was.' The angel symbolises the first ever Christmas- in particular Gabriel, the archangel of revelation, who informed Mary that she would be the mother of Jesus Christ. Also, an angel visited Joseph in a dream to tell him that he would serve as Jesus' father on Earth, and a number of angels appeared in the sky over Bethlehem to announce and celebrate Jesus' birth. A tree was first decorated for Christmas in Latvia in 1510 which soon became a popular tradition. Angels would be placed at the top of a Christmas tree to symbolise the significance of the angels who appeared high above Bethlehem to joyfully announce Jesus' birth on the first Christmas. They are also used to scare away evil spirits from people's homes. If not an angel, a star was used to represent the bright star that appeared in the sky to guide people to Jesus' birthplace. Also, in King James's translation of the Bible it states: 'Lo, the star went before them, till it came and stood over where Baby Jesus was lying.' Since then, stars have become somewhat a fashion statement to place at the top of a tree. Angels on a Christmas tree came to symbolise those that appeared in the sky when Jesus was born .",87% of Debenhams customers prefer star as tree topper with just 9% favouring the traditional angel .

His bizarre and comic comments are thought to have upset police bosses . A popular police officer has stopped using his force's social networking account after being accused of posting too many humourous and bizarre comments on Twitter. PC Andy Hall, 38, had been assigned to pen his own messages on the social networking site, dubbed Tweets from the Beat, to encourage more locals to report crime. But his bosses intervened when the constable started to post a number of comic messages on Greater Manchester Police's official GMP Radcliffe account. Among his random postings were song lyrics, commentary on the X Factor and gags about former pop stars. The officer also used the account to highlight the inflated price of confectionery alongside the hashtag £crimeupdate, including posts saying 'Cadburys Starbar 78p!!? Maltesers 80p!!!' PC Hall would give regular weather reports and . affectionately referred to his beat of Radcliffe, near Bury, Greater . Manchester, as 'Radders'. The officer also posted a child's drawing of himself as well as a tub of unopened lentil soup. The GMP Radcliffe account had been set up . last June after Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy . encouraged its use to help 'engage' with the public. Senior officers eventually stepped in . after a lighthearted tweet was inadvertently posted just hours after a . fatal police pursuit in Radcliffe. Jack Christian, 22, and Lee Perris, . 23, died after their Volkswagen Polo crashed as they were fleeing a . police patrol on Sunday morning. Comic: Some of PC Hall's random tweets, above, garnered him a positive reputation online, with some Twitter users calling him a 'legend' Farewell: The GMP Radcliffe account showing PC Hall's last ever tweet, posted on Monday . Community outreach: PC Hall's tweets often featured song recommendations and weather updates . Later that day, the message 'I will . find. I will hunt you down' was posted on the GMP Radcliffe account. The message, however, was in response to another Twitter user and unrelated to the . tragedy. Senior officers are thought to have spoken to PC Hall and he agreed to hand over his tweeting duties to colleagues. Twitter users condemned the police intervention today after PC Hall signed off with the message: 'I'm going back out on to your streets, where I belong. This is my last ever tweet. See you out there. Take good care Radders. I'm Andy Hall?' Catherine Elizabeth wrote: 'We still love you Andy Hall.Not your fault your bosses are shrivelled up dinosaurs who have no idea how to reach the people.' Another user, known as Stepperz, wrote: 'Absolutely farcical that Andy Hall has been stood down, i will be making my feelings known to his not so superiors.' And Warren Bridge said: 'Well done @GMPRadcliffe I guess policemen are no longer allowed to have a personality. £justiceforandyhall.' Encouragement: Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police Sir Peter Fahy, above, has encouraged officers to engage with the public on social networks . In 2010 the force published a Twitter summary of every incident officers attended over a 24-hour period after Sir Peter said he wanted to show only a third of the incidents his team responds to are genuine crimes. The GMPRadcliffe account has almost 2,000 followers on Twitter. PC Hall amassed a number of fans, with some describing him as a 'legend'. But the officer also divided opinion with some  controversial messages. He once wrote: 'Urgent message to the woman I've just seen in R'cliffe town centre wearing hot pants! Put clothes on! You'll catch a cold! It's winter!!' Another said: 'Last night I dreamt that the ghost of Gloria Gaynor was stood at the end of the bed. First I was afraid, I was petrified....I'm Andy Hall!' Another read: 'We're off duty half hour. Instead of me dedicating songs for you, Tweet me you songs for us. Best one wins a free 2012 calendar.' Greater Manchester Police said PC Hall had not been banned from using the force's Twitter account but agreed to stand down voluntarily. They confirmed officers with access to the GMP Radcliffe account had been given advice regarding the messages. A spokesman said: 'Our neighbourhood officers share information and speak to the communities they serve and we encourage them to use social media to do this. 'We receive positive feedback from people who use networks to speak to their officers. Officers receive training and support but we accept this is a new way of communicating and we will not always get it right. 'This is why we continually ask people for their views and use it to improve what we do.' Commentary: PC Andy Hall wrote about everything from the X Factor to his soup . 'Everyday is like Sunday!

Morrisons is preparing by stocking its shelves with 3,500 sets of false eyelashes, 22,000 units of fake tan, as well as 62,000 units of hair dye and over 85,000 bottles of nail varnish in the weeks leading up to 25th December. A Morrisons spokesperson said: 'The . office Christmas party is an opportunity to let your hair down, enjoy an . evening with colleagues and end the work year on a bang. 'For many, it’s an occasion that requires a new outfit, lippie and a sun kissed glow. 'For . shoppers looking to make an extra effort at this year’s get together, . we’ve ensured that our shelves are fully stocked with items that will . leave you looking and feeling great on the night.' Asda expects false eyelash sales to be up 60 per cent and mascara up a staggering 80 per cent. Gemma Goldstraw, Asda's beauty expert said: 'The party season is upon us and we are stocking up to ensure our customers are fully prepped to take them from desk to dance floor without spending a fortune. Morrisons has stocked their shelves with 85,000 bottles of nail varnish in preparation for Christmas . 'Our beauty products guarantee to add . extra sparkle for less, including our best-selling Shimmer Me bronzers . and Cheeky Tint for a sophisticated seasonal glow. 'Over the next couple of weeks we are . expecting sales of fake tan, lip gloss and Andrew Barton's S.O.S Last . Another Day Dry Shampoo to rocket as our customers glam up and celebrate . over the holiday season.' As for Sainsbury's it's hair styling products that are set to be a sell-out. Asda are expecting to see between a 40-60 per cent increase in beauty product sales over the Christmas party season . Robert Cooke, Sainsbury’s Head of . Buying for Electrical Goods, said: 'Electrical beauty product sales are . rocketing as we approach party season, indicating that women are . becoming increasingly savvy about achieving that sleek salon look at . home and by-passing the cost of a salon visit. 'We expect sales to double over the coming weeks. 'Our best selling range this year is our exclusive Salon Collection hair care range from celebrity hair stylist, Phil Smith. 'Key products for the season are . those that support the trend for “Big Hair”, the most popular will be . the Multi Styler, Curling Wand and our Salon Collection Hair Dryer, all . of which offer Salon performance at great value prices.' A new £20 beauty pack dubbed ‘the supermarket facial’ is set to become the surprise hit of Christmas after 20,000 of them sold out within its first week of launch. Now Sainsbury’s is ordering extra supplies to cope with the sudden demand for the pack to avoid shortages on the shelves in light of the sudden demand. The Ultimate Pamper Kit, a tote bag containing a range of ‘pamper’ treatments, was launched exclusively by the supermarket a week ago but has already sold out, said the retail giant. The Nip and Fab ultimate pamper kit is Sainsbury's surprise beauty Christmas gift hit . Makers Nip + Fab say the pack of facial scrub, hydrating mark, moisturiser, body wash, hand and eye cream replicate the effects of spa treatments costing around £200. And in these budget conscious times, they are becoming this year’s ‘Tracy Island’ as the unexpected festive gift for this year. Every year throws up a surprise best seller, such as Heston Blumenthal’s ‘hidden orange’ last year and, perhaps most famously, the Thunderbirds toy Tracy Island in 2000. A spokeswoman for Nip + Fab said the pamper kit had been designed by beauty experts with ‘20 years experience’ but at a price that was within the range of most British women. She said: 'Our customers are more beauty aware than ever before and we have seen a great response to the Nip + Fab pamper kit. 'While time savvy women want to look their best, it’s unrealistic due to pressures of families and work for them to spare a whole day at a spa for treatments such as facials. 'This treatment can be done in the luxury of your home and takes just 20 minutes. Women are more conscious than ever about looking after their skin but with facial treatments costing up to £200 it’s a luxury that most simply cannot justify.' Celebrity beauty therapist Nuz Sugaa added: 'The premium ingredients in the Nip + Fab products will give the same desired results as many professional facials. 'The key elements of exfoliation, cleanse, hydration and protection are all covered in this clever kit.' A spokeswoman for Sainsbury’s said: 'Our customers are more beauty aware than ever before and we have seen a great response to the what has been dubbed, ‘the supermarket facial.'","Morrisons stocks shelves with 3,500 false eyelash sets, 62,000 units of hair dye and 22,000 units of fake tan .

Fashion statement: Vogue editor Anna Wintour is rumoured to be about to . become the next Ambassador to London . Anna Wintour was keeping tight-lipped over rumours that she is set to become the new US ambassador to London as she stepped out at the premiere of a new documentary about her role as editor of Vogue. Miss Wintour, who donated tens of thousands of dollars to the Obama election campaign and helped raise another $500,000, is in line to top a shortlist being drawn up by President to replace outgoing ambassador Louis Susman. The UK-born editor of US Vogue was joined on the red carpet in New York by Sex and the City's Sarah Jessica Parker at whose house she hosted a $40,000-a-plate fundraising dinner. She is being linked to the job of ambassador in both the UK and France with some speculators suggesting her glittering contacts book would make her the perfect choice and others writing it off as laughable. A Vogue insider said that Miss Wintour was 'very happy with her current job' and a spokesman for the White House did not deny that it was courting her, but added: 'We have no personnel announcement to make at this time'. The new documentary, In Vogue: The Editor's Eye, portrays a totally different Wintour to the aloof and arrogant ice maiden lampooned in the film Devil Wears Prada. Fenton Bailey, the co-director of the latest HBO production described the 62-year-old as being 'accessible, smart and fuzzy.' As well as hosting fundraising dinners for the Obama campaign, Miss Wintour also brought together leading designers to create accessories emblazoned with the President's image. Her main competition for the job comes from Matthew Barzun, finance chairman of the President’s re-election campaign. A Democrat source in Washington said: 'A large number of Obama’s ambassadors have been fundraisers. Both these two fit the bill. 'Anna Wintour is just the kind of figure who could be an effective ambassador. 'You’re . a messenger boy or girl for the President to the host government and to . the business and political worlds, but you’re also supposed to be able . to throw a party. 'She’s . obviously got fantastic connections in London and that would be an . advantage. She’s the definition of a glamour pick. I can see it . happening.' Ambassadorships to friendly countries . are commonly given to top-tier fundraisers as a thank you gift after a . tough campaign, and the post in London is one of the nicest among them. An article by Bloomberg cites . two people, described only as being 'familiar with the matter', as . saying Susman is one of three ambassadors with plum positions who will . not be continuing abroad. Dan . Rooney, the owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers who is currently the . ambassador to Ireland, and Charles Rivkin, the former executive of Jim . Henson Co. who is the ambassador to France, will also be returning to . the U.S. The fact that she is a dual . citizen of the U.S. and the U.K. also helps Wintour's cause, but . Bloomberg asserts that she may have competition for the gig. Matthew Barzun, who served as finance chairman for the re-election campaign, is said to be interested in the job. The UK-born editor of US Vogue was joined on the red carpet by Sex and the City's Sarah Jessica Parker at whose house she hosted a $40,000-a-plate fundraising dinner for the Obama campaign . Turnout: Actress Dianna Agron, fashion designer Vera Wang and actress Nora Zehetne were also at the New York premiere of the new HBO documentary  'In Vogue: The Editor's Eye' Miss Wintour is known for her . withering put-downs in her fashion empire and has even been given the . unflattering nickname Nuclear Wintour. The . daughter of one-time Evening Standard editor Charles Wintour, she was . born in London but has relinquished her British citizenship. Wintour has hosted a number of . fundraisers for the President in the past few months, all of which have . shown the strength of her Rolodex. In . May, she co-hosted a $40,000-per-plate dinner for 50 people in actress . Sarah Jessica Parker's Manhattan townhouse. Prior to the dinner, she . even appeared in a YouTube video promoting the dinner which offered up . two raffled tickets to the event.

Payback: President Obama, seen here while he was just a candidate in 2008, rewarded Dan Rooney's support with the post of ambassador to Ireland . Wintour was born in London on November 3, 1949, the eldest daughter of Charles Wintour - editor of the London Evening Standard. As a teen, she worked at boutiques and gained experience at a series of magazines before moving to New York. She became junior fashion editor at Harper's Bazaar in 1975 and she secured a role at Vogue in 1983 as the magazine's first creative director. After . stints at British Vogue and House & Garden, she eventually took . over as editor of Vogue in 1988 and changed the direction of the . magazine, elevating photographers and covering harder news pieces. Amid . rumours she would be replaced, Wintour said in 2009 that she would not . retire. That year, she also appeared in a film about the magazine, The . September Issue. She is known for her withering . put-downs in her fashion empire and has even been given the unflattering . nickname Nuclear Wintour.

Competition: Matthew Barzun (left), who served . as finance chairman for the re-election campaign, is eying the British . ambassadorship, and Marc Lasry (right), a major bundler, reportedly . wants the one in France . In August, she moved her sights out of . the city and partnered up with Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and . his fashion designer wife Georgina Chapman to host a $38,500-per-plate . dinner in their Connecticut home. She used more than just her contacts to make the money flow in for the President during the long campaign. Wintour . used her fashion and business savvy to draw up a spreadsheet and prove . to the President's aides that the creation of a high-end accessories . line would bring in a sizable amount of cash for the campaign. From there, she enlisted a host of designer friends to create the goods. Derek . Lam designed a $75 tote bag, Thakoon Panichgul made a $95 scarf with . Obama's face pictured, and Richard Blanch was behind the makeup bag that . contained red, white and blue nail polish. Considering . her prominent position on the donor list and the cycle of turning . donors into ambassadors, it comes as little surprise that Wintour's name . has been floated as a possibility. Big money: Wintour's fundraising efforts included a $40,000 a night dinner at the home of Sex & The City star Sarah Jessica Parker (pictured) Similarities: Pamela Harriman was made the American ambassador to France in 1993 . With her English upbringing, expensive taste and cosy relationships with Democrats, Anna Wintour strikes similarities with a former ambassador for the U.S., Pamela Harriman. The powerful socialite, who is also known as Winston Churchill's daughter-in-law, was appointed as U.S. Ambassador to France by President Clinton in 1993, when she was 73 years old. After a charmed childhood in the southwest of England, Harriman studied in Germany and Paris, before working at the Foreign Office in London as a translator. There, she was introduced to Randolph Churchill, the prime minister's son, and he proposed to her in 1939 - on the first night they met. After having a child, they eventually . divorced and she moved to Paris. And after meeting . Broadway producer Leland Hayward in 1959, she moved to New York, and they married in 1960. She . enjoyed a lavish lifestyle from his successful musicals, including the . Sound of Music. After his death in 1971, she married a former flame, Averell Harriman, moved to Washington D.C. and became a U.S. citizen. She became involved with the Democratic Party and helped create fundraising . systems, throwing desirable parties - which she oversaw with an exacting eye - attended by the city's most famous faces, much like the events previously thrown by Wintour for Obama. After her husband died, leaving her with $75 million, Harriman's presence among political soirees grew and she was known to charge as much as $1,000 for a ticket to her parties, with proceeds going to the Democrats. She was appointed at U.S. Ambassador to France by President . Clinton in 1993. In a sign of their close friendship, when she passed away aged 76 in 1997, Clinton dispatched Air Force One to bring her body . from France to the U.S. and even spoke at her funeral in D.C.

As the UK divorce rate continues to soar, a new study has today shown how marital harmony is thriving in the penguin world. Research has revealed a pair of Magellanic penguins as among the most faithful in the animal kingdom. The couple have remained loyal to each other over a 16-year period, in spite of spending thousands of miles apart during their winter trips. Scroll down for video . Faithful: New research shows how a pair of Magellanic penguins were loyal to each other for 16 years (file picture) The findings come after a 30-year study of . the breed where researchers placed metal identity bands on the flippers of 50,000 birds on the southern coast of Argentina. Previously penguin relationships were believed to span a maximum of just 10 years, with many cut short by the unexpected death of birds during migration. 'Divorce' is also a possibility as couples who fail to hatch chicks will split up and find new mates. But according to The Sunday Telegraph, biologists have been surprised by the longevity of the relationship between a particular couple. 'The bond they have is incredible really,' lead researcher Dr Pablo Garcia Borboroglu, of the National Research Council of Argentina, told the newspaper. 'It is unbelievable how far Magellanic penguins swim – and each breeding season they come back to the same nest and to the same partner.' Loyal: A pair of penguins can track each other down among hundreds of thousands of other birds using a distinctive call . The research was revealed during a lecture to the Whitley Fund for Nature in London, and Dr Borboroglu will set out his findings in a book to be published next year called Penguins: Natural History and Conservation. Magellanic penguins can only be found around the Falkland Islands and South America. Loving: A Magellanic penguin stays loyal to the same mate, in spite of long periods apart . Argentina has the highest population, with 900,000 breeding pairs in Argentina, while there are 800,000 couples in Chile. But their numbers have dropped dramatically since the turn of the . century due to oil pollution and falling fish numbers and there are thought to be around 1.2 million left . in the world. Dr Borboroglu's project also used satellite tracking to identify the . movements of the birds, showing the enormous . journeys they travel each winter to the warmer waters of Brazil. Every year, the penguins arrive at their summer nests in the southern hemisphere and find their partners using a distinctive call. After reuniting and mating, the female usually lay two eggs, which each partner takes turns guarding while the other goes out to sea. After they hatch, the parents spend a month caring for their young before heading off to their wintering area. The penguins join a roll call of other animals that undertake loyal relationships, including the albatross, French angelfish and black vultures. Mates for life: In spite of long distance flights, albatrosses always return to breed with the same partners . Jealous: Like the Magellanic penguin, black vultures are strictly monogamous .","Penguin couple stayed together for 16 years, smashing all previous records .

A former Met policeman has come to the rescue of sweet-toothed vegetarians who want to enjoy treats made without animal extracts. John Baldock, 56, has opened the UK's first entirely vegetarian sweet shop with products made using plant extracts instead of gelatine. His store, called Sweet Expectations in Rochester, Kent, is modelled on a traditional sweet shop with the animal-free treats displayed in giant jars and served by weight. Serving up animal-free treats: John Baldock runs the UK's first-ever entirely vegetarian sweet shop in Kent . John said he decided to open the store because he was fed up of missing out on eating sweets after becoming a vegetarian at the age of 12 when growing up on a farm. He said: 'I . gave up meat because I loved the animals too much. When I told my mum . she told me I was going through a funny phase. 'It is very difficult when you are a vegetarian to find products that you know are 100 per cent meat-free. Most people don't know when they buy . some red coloured sweets they are coloured with cochineal - in other . words they are eating crushed beetles. Sweet expectations: The store is modelled on a traditional sweet shop but only has products made using plant extracts not gelatine . 'Now we only sell sweets which contain beetroot. There are so many vegetarians across the UK now and I think my shop has filed a gap in the market.' Many sweets contain gelatin which is derived from collagen from animal by-products. Confectioners traditionally extract the chemical from animals then use it to make most chewy and boiled sweets . and marshmallows. John uses carnauba wax from Brazilian palm leaves and agar agar from red marine algae to make his vegetarian versions. Business is booming: John said there is a gap in the market for his sweets and his success has meant he can take on staff like assistant Megan Clayson, pictured . His shop is the only entirely veggie sweet shop in the UK according to the Vegetarian Society. The father-of-two said business has been booming since he opened his store and the lifestyle is a complete change of pace to his old police job.

Change of pace: The former policeman, pictured in uniform on the day of his wedding to wife Virginia, served with the Met for 30 years . He said: 'Working for the police is all encompassing and it can be hard when you retire. Now I have a new challenge to focus on.'

Champagne lifestyle: Thomas Scragg has been told to pay back just £980,000 after conning UK tax officials out of £34m . A businessman who masterminded a £34million VAT scam has been ordered to pay back just £980,000 after a court heard he had blown the rest on a lavish champagne lifestyle. Thomas Scragg, 56, was jailed for 17 years after being convicted of leading one of the biggest scams in British fraud history. The career criminal spent £14 million living the high-life in top London hotels and restaurants as well as splashing out on luxury cars. The conman also spent fortunes in casinos and paid thousands for sporting memorabilia - including Amir Khan’s boxing gloves and Diego Maradona’s shorts. After conning the Inland Revenue over a five year period he was finally caught when his henchmen Carl and Anthony Johnson were heard boasting by neighbours: 'crime does pay.' A police investigation then exposed his criminal empire and officers uncovered another £8 million of stolen PAYE tax in a ten-month period from April 2007 and February 2008. Scragg, from Solihull West Midlands, was jailed for 13 years in November 2010 and was given a further four years in March 2011 - making it the second-longest sentence ever received in the UK for a white-collar crime. But reporting restrictions were only lifted in July this year after the convictions of gangster brothers Carl, 49, and Anthony, 51, for money laundering. Today a Proceeds of Crime hearing heard Rolex-wearing Scragg had just £982,247 left in assets. He has now been given just six months to pay up or face a further three years in jail. David Farrer QC, prosecuting, said Scragg’s ill-gotten gains had been 'hugely reduced' by the lifestyle he had pursued due to his 'enormous expenditure'. The crown are already in possession of Scragg’s property worth just over £730,000 and is now looking to recoup cash gifts made during the fraud - totalling £252,566. Detective Chief Inspector Shaun . Edwards from West Midlands Police, said at the time of the convictions: . 'This was fraud and money laundering on a massive scale; it deprived the . public purse of millions of pounds and Scragg’s audacity is shown by . the fact he continued the fraud in various guises even after he knew he . was being investigated. 'A number of my officers have devoted . the last five-and-a-half years to bringing these men to justice and I’m . pleased that we can now tell the world about the extent of their crimes . for the first time.

Scragg enlisted the Johnson brothers for protection after surviving a kidnap attempt. Scragg, from Solihull West Midlands, was jailed for 13 years in November 2010 and was given a further four years in March 2011. Reporting restrictions have just been lifted . They were paid £2.4 million by Scragg for their protection services and lived extravagant lifestyles as a result.

Carl had bulletproof glass put in his home, while Anthony rebuilt his house - installing a cinema room, stables and dog kennels. They . also drove around in expensive cars including a Lamborghini Murcielago, . Bentley Continental, Porsche Cayenne and Ferrari Spider.

He eventually pulled the keys from the vehicle's ignition . The 32-year-old, who later pulled the keys from the vehicle's ignition, had dived in front of the car to push his friend out of the way. He also crashed into the patio tables outside a pub as terrified customers jumped out of the way. Jonathan Steel was trapped by the furniture as the vehicle hurtled into the pub. He said: 'He just ploughed into the pub. I was pinned against the wall. I count myself lucky I was not seriously hurt.' In a bizarre sequence captured on . CCTV, Eastwood then reversed off as men in fancy dress, security guards . and Mr Peace chased him along the road. Recalling . the incident, Mr Pearce said: 'He mounted the path. I heard an engine . and I turned and saw the car in front of me and it ran straight over my . feet. I ran after him, I swung my arm into the driver's window and . grabbed the keys to stop him driving off again. I wanted to hit him.' He added: 'It was like there was . nobody behind the wheel. When I looked at him, he looked out of it. It . was like he was looking through me, not at me. 'The police said he was so legless, he couldn't stand up' Eastwood, of Thanet Road, east Hull, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and drink-driving. His solicitor, Jo Golding, described the CCTV as a 'graphic depiction of dangerous driving'. She said: 'It is right to say it was a . moment of motoring madness. Mercifully, there were no serious injuries . as a result of his actions.' The law arrives: A police van turns the corner as Eastwood drives along a pavement ahead of them . Approaching: Officers close in on Eastwood but he attempts to drive off, top of the screen . 'The . Army has a zero-tolerance on drink-driving and he is now effectively . out of the Army. He wanted to fight for his country and he will not be . able to do that now.' Recorder . Cook told him: 'It seems to me you have lost a lot in life in the last . few months. You tragically lost your brother and your Army career. You . were prepared to go to Afghanistan and put your body on the line and I . think you should have credit for that. 'You need to move on. If you drink, drink in moderation and stay well clear of cars.' Eastwood was given a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work. He was banned from driving for 18 months and ordered to take an extended driving test. Making a scene: Crowds of revellers begin to approach the scene after being alerted to the commotion .

Israel Keyes, the serial killer linked to eight murders, strangled his final victim and left then left her body in his shed in Alaska for two weeks while he went on a cruise in the Gulf of Mexico. Keyes' vacation is only the latest horrific detail to emerge in the killing of Samantha Koenig, 18, who was abducted from her Anchorage coffee stand in February. Federal authorities revealed on Wednesday that after his cruise, Keyes returned home to stage a ransom note with Miss Koenig's dead body and then dismembered her remains and dumped them in a lake. Keyes, 34, committed suicide in his Anchorage jail cell on Sunday while he awaited federal trial for Koenig's murder. Scroll down for video . Abducted: Keyes was tied to the death of Samantha 'Sammy' Koenig, a barista who vanished in February from her coffee stand workplace . Dead: Israel Keyes, 34, who was liked to the murders of Samantha Koenig and numerous others across the country, was found dead in his jail cell on Sunday morning in an apparent suicide . His own death was much like the murders he committed - brutal, slow and deliberate. Authorities said . he slashed open one of his wrists with a disposable razor blade that he . an embedded in a pencil and his in his mattress. He then strangled himself with a rolled up bed sheet. Alaska state troopers said it wasn't a hanging - Keyes had to lean against the makeshift noose to ensure he died. Before his death, he confessed to killing four people in Washington state, one in New York and a Vermont couple. According to federal prosecutors, Keyes abducted Koenig at gunpoint on February 1 after ordering coffee from her stand. He kept her alive . for several harrowing hours - including driving her back to her coffee . stand so he could retrieve her cell phone. He locked her in a shed on . his property and went to her boyfriend's house, where he stole her debit . card.

He did not return . until February 17 to Koenig's body, which was still kept in his shed, . preserved in the deep freeze of Anchorage's winter. When he got back . to town, he posed Koenig's body to make it appear she was still alive . and took a Polaroid photo of her tied up, along with a newspaper dated . February 13 - 12 days after the abduction. He later typed a . ransom note demanding $30,000 from Koenig's family on the back of a . photocopy of the photo, sending a text message from the woman's . cellphone with directions to the note. Keyes dismembered . Koenig's body and disposed of the remains in a frozen lake north of . Anchorage after he cut a hole in the ice, the FBI said in a release. Revelations: Police say that Keyes confessed to killing Bill and Lorraine Currier, pictured, who have not been seen since June 2011. He also said that he sexually assaulted Mrs Currier before strangling her . Informing the public: Essex Junction Police Chief Brad Larose, left, speaks at a news conference on Monday, where he revealed that Keyes had implicated himself in the Curriers' murder . Authorities also released . chilling video footage of Keyes abducting Koenig, caught by surveillance . cameras in and outside the coffee shop. Keyes was arrested in Koenig's death in March in Texas, after using her . stolen debit cards at ATMs there and in Alaska, Arizona and New Mexico. After his arrest, Keyes confessed to killing Koenig and at least seven other people across the country over the past decade. His other known victims were Bill and Lorraine Currier of Essex, Vermont, who disappeared in June 2011. He told police he broke into their home, went into their bedroom, bound them with zip ties and forced them into their car. He then drove them to an abandoned house and tied Bill to a stool in the basement, while Lorraine Currier tried to escape, Chittenden County state's attorney T.J. Donovan said on Monday. Discovering this, Keyes ran out and tackled Lorraine, and Bill then tried to escape. He shot Bill . Currier with the gun he had stolen from the couple's home, and then . sexually assaulted and strangled Lorraine Currier, Donovan said, his . voice breaking. Confessions of a killer: U.S. Attorney Tristram Coffin, pictured, told reporters on Monday that Keyes killed 'because he liked to do it' Their bodies have never been found, and Keyes did not volunteer the information. 'They fought to the end,' Donovan said, adding that they showed 'extraordinary bravery and love for each other.' Keyes told authorities he also sexually assaulted and strangled Lorraine Currier. The couple's bodies have not been found. Tristram Coffin, U.S. Attorney in Vermont, said during a news conference on Monday: 'He provided some motivation, but I don't think it's really [possible] to pigeonhole why he did this.' Mr Coffin added: . 'It was something that he could control and he liked to do it. Why . someone likes to act like that, nobody knows.' Keyes confessed to other killings without identifying the victims or saying where their remains were, other than that four were killed in Washington state and one in New York. Keyes, who faced a March trial in Koenig's death, was found dead in his Anchorage jail cell Sunday after he apparently killed himself. Authorities wouldn't say how he killed himself, only that he was alone in his cell. An autopsy will be conducted. Final hours: Samantha can be seen working at the coffee shop in this security video as her killer (seen lower left) approaches . Panic: After handing him the drink he ordered, Samantha is seen putting her hands up several times before Keyes orders her to shut off the lights in the shop . Last seen: Keyes is seen leading his victim through the parking lot. He told police that he sexually assaulted and strangled her the next day . Stolen: After killing Koenig, police said that Keyes used her phone to fake text messages from her and conceal the abduction . In the video, Keyes can be seen approaching the window of the Anchorage coffee kiosk. He then orders an Americano coffee, which Samantha makes. But after handing him the drink, she is seen putting her hands up several times before Keyes orders her to shut off the lights and uses zip ties to bind her hands behind her back. He then climbs in through the window and leads her out. The two can be seen walking in the parking lot to his vehicle. Keyes told Samantha that he would let her go if her family paid a ransom, but that was never his intention, police said. Gone too soon: Keyes told Samantha he would let her go if her family paid a ransom, but that was never his intention, police said . 'He knew all along he was going to kill her,' Anchorage homicide Detective Monique Doll said. Koenig's body was recovered from the lake in April. Another video released Tuesday shows a man identified as Keyes getting out of a white truck parked in nearby parking lot just before the abduction took place, and returning with another person he appeared to gripping tightly. Police said Tuesday a license plate, green toolboxes and a ladder rack had been removed from the pickup truck before the abduction, then reinstalled afterward so Keyes could disguise the vehicle, which had an extended bed. In their investigation, the vehicle appeared twice in a list of 750 local white trucks of the same kind, but police scratched it off the list of possibilities because it looked so different. Authorities say Keyes traveled extensively in the U.S., landing at one location and targeting victims randomly hundreds of miles away. In the Koenig case, he stuck to his own town. 'He broke his own rule,' Doll said. Samantha's family said that despite the proximity, there was no apparent previous connection between the teen and the suspect. Reached by phone on Sunday, Samantha's father, James Koenig declined to comment on Keyes' death.

As a species they are notorious for their scavenging nature, so it's no surprise that this fox attempted a smash and grab raid on a Golden Eagle's lunch. But the less than wily creature is outfoxed by the giant bird of prey as it digs its claws in and defends its meal. The plucky fox was clearly willing to put up a fight to make sure he had his share of the eagle's spoils - but was eventually overpowered by the enormous bird. Attack: Yves Adams stunning photo captured the moment a Golden Eagle dug its claws in to the not so wily fox that tried to steal his lunch . Scrap: The fox fights back baring its teeth at the angry eagle . Fight: The plucky fox is knocked to the ground as the tussle between the two animals continues . The dramatic face-off was captured on camera by Belgian photographer Yves Adams, as the animals fought in the snow and freezing temperatures - which plummeted to -20C - in Bulgaria. He had been laying patiently in wait to capture shots of vultures which the Bulgarian Government has recently reintroduced into the wild but instead came away with these magnificent stills. Yves said: 'I had been photographing the vultures and an eagle eating from the carrion for about an hour. 'The eagle was getting stuffed and the Ravens started to give up their harassing, when suddenly something reddish came over the ridge, behind the eagle, too blurred for me to see through my low depth of field 600mm lens.

'But what happened then was incredible - a red fox came down to the feeding station, to grab some meat, but the Golden eagle wasn't really pleased with that and chased the poor fox away! 'I could hardly hold my joy when I saw most of the shots were pin-sharp and both animals had great expressions! I was really lucky to had my complete set-up in the perfect settings. 'I had never been to Bulgaria before, but after this experience, I know I had been waiting too long to discover the beautiful country.'

"By . Sam Dunn . PUBLISHED: . 18:39 EST, 5 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:27 EST, 6 December 2012 . A record 4.5million workers could be paying higher-rate tax by the end of this Parliament. The number in the 40 per cent band is expected to rise from 3.8million today by another 400,000 over the next three years, the Treasury said yesterday. However, experts predicted the number dragged into the higher rate could be an additional 300,000 – which would in total account for nearly one in six taxpayers. 'It seems a bit unfair': Civil servant John Bilbrough with wife Helen and sons Ben, nine, and Zac, six (see Case Study) John Bilbrough, 39, is a civil servant edging perilously closer to becoming a higher-rate taxpayer. The father of two from Totnes, Devon, earns £39,700 as a project manager with the Environment Agency. He expects that salary to increase in line with inflation, about 2.6 per cent, but with the higher tax rate threshold increasing by just 1 per cent to £41,685 – behind the inflation rate – he looks certain to pass it within a year or two. Mr Bilbrough said that he and his wife Helen, 39, who earns £7,000 a year as a part-time office manager, will be paying more tax without actually being better off. He said: ‘If we were both earning more than £40,000 I would say fair enough. But considering it’s only me, I don’t think we should be in the higher tax rate category. It seems a bit unfair.’ Yesterday, the Chancellor announced that the point at which workers start paying higher-rate tax was to increase by one per cent a year. But as this increase is likely to lag behind pay rises, this will push anyone just below the limit today into the higher band. Mike Warburton, of accountancy giant Grant Thornton, said: ‘The Chancellor’s move will drag many more hard workers into a higher-rate tax band, most of whom will not consider themselves wealthy by a long shot. Every year the starting point for 40 per cent tax keeps being pushed down.’ In the hope of raising £3.3billion by 2018, Mr Osborne announced he would limit the size of the increase in the personal tax thresholds. Currently, everyone can earn £8,105 without paying a penny of tax. For the next £34,370 they earn they pay income tax of 20 per cent. This means that once they have a salary of £42,475, they would pay 40 per cent income tax for every additional pound they earn. Normally, these limits rise in line with inflation to take into account rises in the cost of living. However, by raising the point at which higher rate is paid by a flat 1 per cent instead, which will happen for two years from 2014, more workers will be dragged into this 40 per cent band. Next year, the point at which this starts will be £41,450. The reason for this initial drop is to stop wealthier taxpayers receiving an increase in the amount of income they can earn tax-free. In 2014 the 40 per cent band will start at £41,865 and then will again rise in 2015, to £42,285. The highest previous number of higher-rate taxpayers was 3.87million under the Labour government in 2007-2008. At the start of this Parliament there were 3million. Money, money, money: Chancellor George Osborne left, walks with Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, as he leaves the Treasury to deliver today's Autumn Statement . The Treasury’s own figures estimate there could be another 600,000 on top of the current 3.8million by April 2014. This increase will raise £295million, and then £875million by April 2016 and £1.1billion after that. The higher tax bills will hit families struggling to pay off mortgages and grappling with rocketing fuel bills and punitive petrol prices. Earlier this year, research for the Institute for Fiscal Studies showed the higher-rate tax trap was hammering those earning ‘relatively modest’ salaries. It also highlighted the huge rise in the percentage of all taxpayers caught in the 40 per cent tax net. In 1978, the net ensnared three per cent of taxpayers, and edged up to five per cent by the late 1980s. But it has more than doubled to 12.5 per cent today, and is estimated to be 15 per cent next year. At present, there are 29.7million taxpayers in Britain. Of the total, 4.1million, which is equal to 13.8 per cent, are either higher-rate or ‘additional’ 50 per cent taxpayers.","A record 4.5million could be paying the higher tax rate by the end of this Parliament .

But Mr Lambert and his wife Helen, who are both fans of the brand, were puzzled after they were unable to find any information on it in their Royal Doulton books. The Lamberts paid just £2 for a rare Royal Doulton 'Spook' ornament was produced in 1922 . This figurine is thought to have a one-off prototype glaze, which helped boost its value further . The base reveals the Royal Doulton stamp and gives an idea of just how old the ornament is . They took it to valuers from BBC's Flog It programme, and were thrilled to discover they had bought a 1922 'Spook' figure believed to be worth around £300. The excited couple, from Colne, Lancashire put the figurine up to auction and were shocked when bids reached almost £5,000. Auctioneer, John Cook, who sold the ornament at Gerrard’s Auctions, Lytham St Anne's was surprised to see its blue colour and believes it is a prototype glaze. He thinks the figure could be the only one in this colour and this is why the hammer fell much higher than expected. David and Helen Lambert beam with a photo of the car boot sale find which netted them £5,000 . The lucky couple from Colne, Lancashire, head to car boot sales in search of a bargain most weekends but have decided to save the cash they raised from selling the ornament. Helen said: 'When David first came home with the piece I really didn’t like it. 'The auction was just unbelievable and I was shocked at the starting price let alone what it actually sold for. 'After the sale I rang David to tell him what had happened. He couldn’t believe it and I was shaking when I was telling him so I had to get the lady from the auction room to confirm the news for him. 'I think this sort of thing is a only once in a lifetime thing to happen to people and we don’t expect it to happen again.'

'The . vast majority of prizes are claimed within the 180 days but to avoid . this unfortunate situation happening again, we would urge all National Lottery players to check their tickets on a regular basis.' The distribution of the money will be the responsibility of 13 lottery . distribution bodies across the country. Health, Education, Environment, and charitable causes will receive the lion's share of the winnings, at 40 per cent. Sports, The Arts and Heritage will each receive 20 per cent. Michael . Thompson, a spokesman for The National Lottery Good Causes, said: . 'Countless good causes will benefit from this unclaimed prize. 'National Lottery players should be proud that they are helping so many good causes in their own area.” 'In theory, the £64 million unclaimed prize would fund over 6,000 minibuses to help kids with disabilities. 'The . £64 million would also fund the improvement of approximately 7,800 play . areas for children across the UK and build over 1,000 village . halls/community centres across the UK'. National . Lottery officials launched a desperate search for the holder, raising . awareness through adverts and posters - with even a town crier . proclaiming the win from a Lamborghini. All . lottery players were urged to check their tickets and search some of the . more unusual places where “lost” tickets have been found in the past, . such as in bin bags, wedged down the back of sofas and stashed in car . sun visors. The . lottery spokeswoman added: 'We tried very hard to find the . ticket-holder, with lots of awareness-raising activity over the past 180 . days, and it’s a real shame that they have missed out, but there is . still one winner - the nation. In 2001 Martyn Tott, a purchasing . manager from Watford, missed out on a jackpot of £3,011,065 after losing . his ticket. Using computer records, he was able to prove the winning . ticket was his but Camelot refused to pay out — since the rules state . that the winner must have their ticket to claim their fortune. The . decision sparked a national furore, with even the then Prime Minister . Tony Blair championing Mr Tott’s cause — but all in vain. The prize money would have allowed the . winner to buy 339 houses at the  average Stevenage price of £190,000  or . — should the urge take them — more than two million bottles of . champagne. It would . also have made them a good deal richer than the commuter town’s most . glamorous son, F1 driver Lewis Hamilton (who is worth a reported . £55 million), and almost three times wealthier than local Harry Potter . star Rupert Grint (worth a relatively paltry £24 million). In 2004, £7 million went unclaimed in Belfast, and in September 2007 a £6.9 million win wasn’t claimed in Devon. Winner: Past Stevenage lottery winners include Sharon Creighton pictured celebrating with her son James at Knebworth House in 2005 . Loser: Martyn Tott, from Watford, missed out on a £3million jackpot when he didn't claim a lottery win in time . Yesterday . a drawing by Italian artist Raphael fetched a record £29 million at . auction - a price that would leave the ticket holder with plenty of cash . left in their pocket. A Boeing 737 plane . If their art tastes are more modern, Damien Hirst’s diamond-encrusted skull is worth £50 million. 60 Eurocopters .

Manchester City’s first team for a season . 500,000 bottles of 2002 Dom Perignon 200 . Until now the largest unclaimed sum is £9.4 million, on a ticket that was bought in Doncaster in July 2005. Camelot’s Simon Horne says: ‘We all want winners to get their money but there must be a deadline. Otherwise . every prize would just go on indefinitely. But this way billions of . pounds have gone to good causes over the years — from funding the . Olympics through bodies like Sport England to local playgroups and Scout . clubs.’ Still, the psychological fallout of a near miss can be devastating. After Mr Tott was denied his millions . he plunged into depression, separated from his partner and moved to . America, where he joined an evangelical cult. He has since returned and, . claiming to have found happiness, written a book about his ordeal. Residents . in Stevenage can readily imagine the pain of losing a winning ticket. Marion Johnson, 56, a human resources manager, says: ‘Can you imagine? It would be awful. It’s money that could completely change your life. If . that were me, I’d feel sick.’ Of course, the treasure hunt would not be needed if Camelot revealed  the precise place where the winning ticket was sold. Purchasing . records mean that they can easily identify the shop — but the company’s . licence forbids it from making that information public in order to . maximise the winner’s chances of anonymity.

The sister of Janee Parsons, 31, said a ‘piece of me died’ the day she died, while her biological father said he was left with a ‘tremendous hole’ in his heart. Mother-of-two Mrs Parsons died from multiple stab wounds and was discovered by police after they were called to her detached home in Bicester, Oxfordshire on Saturday. 'Piece of me died': The family of American-born Janee Parsons (right with husband Andrew), have spoken of their grief days after Andrew faced court charged with her stabbing murder . Her husband, 38-year-old Andrew Parsons, was found in their rented house with his severely injured wife after neighbours heard chilling screams and dialled 999. He was remanded in custody after being charged with murder this week. Parsons will appear at Oxford Crown Court on February 11 when he is expected to enter a plea to the charge. Today the mother of Texan-born Mrs Parsons, who had two boys aged five and eight, said she was a ‘great gift from God’ who would be deeply missed. Mary Brady said in a statement issued through Thames Valley Police: ‘Janee made me laugh and cry and was one of the brightest lights in my life. ‘She was a wonderful mother and was a tireless worker. I will deeply miss her and cherish her as the great gift from God that she was.’ Violence: American-born Mrs Parsons was stabbed to death at the family home in Bicester, Oxfordshire on Saturday after police were called by neighbours heard chilling screams and dialled 999 . 'Great gift from God': Mother Mary Brady said Mrs Parsons was a 'wonderful mother' and a 'tireless worker' Mrs Brady said that from the age of . three, her daughter had big aspirations, adding: ‘She always wanted to . be the best and smartest at everything she did. ‘She very rarely took no for an answer and her attention to detail was easily seen through her children and her career.’ Phil Brady, Mrs Parsons’ adopted father, said: ‘Janee left a huge impact on everyone she met, whether an acquaintance or myself - her father for 27 years. ‘There will never be a day in my life that Janee will not be missed.’ John Jacks, her biological father, said: ‘She was a child who never disappointed me and was very honest and loyal. I now have a tremendous hole in my heart.’ Muder probe: Police sealed off the house in Bicester where Mrs Parsons' body was found . Mrs Parsons’ sister, Jocelyn Brady, described her as ‘passionate, vivacious and magnetic’. She added: ‘To say that I will miss her terribly cannot even begin to explain how I feel. A piece of me died the day she died.’ Shocked neighbour Andrea Duggan, 69, said at the time of the suspected murder: 'It’s such a horrendous thing to happen to a young family. 'You just can’t imagine what those two little boys are going through and you can only pray that they’ll be okay. 'It must be awful for their relatives too, being so far away in the US. It must be like a nightmare. 'I haven’t lived here long but it’s quite a close community. I think everyone is a bit shaken up by it, and a bit nervous.' Tribute: One of many cards left outside the house by friends, neighbours and classmates of Mrs Parsons' sons . Neighbours said the family were under financial pressure and had recently set up two businesses in a bid to raise money. One said: ‘My children are friends with the kids and they feel like they want to help but they just can’t.’ The couple are believed to have moved to Britain from the US after Mrs Parsons sold her health spa business in Oklahoma when it ran into financial difficulty. Parsons, who has also worked as a fencer and builder, graduated from Bicester Community College in 1990. His mother Jean lives a short distance away. Companies House records show he set up a heat pumps firm in October and his wife set up a company, called Wink Ink Ltd, two months earlier.

Britain’s biggest collection of light bulbs went under the hammer for £1,750 at auction today. The set of more than 500 bulbs was bought as a single lot by a European buyer after the electrician who spent years collecting them died. It was described by auctioneer David Lay as 'probably the finest collection of light bulbs that has ever gone up for auction.' They date back to 1890 and were amassed by Bill Carlton - a lighting and engineering specialist who travelled the world for his work. Bill Carlton's 500 lightbulbs are expected to fetch more than £3,000 when they are auctioned . The late electrician collected the bulbs over an illustrious career which saw him light Westminster Abbey . Bill spent 30 years with Philips Electrical and was responsible for the interior lighting and floodlighting at Salisbury Cathedral, Westminster Abbey and Bath Abbey. In 1988 even appeared on the scientific TV quiz show Brainstorm hosted by Kenny Everett to explain the development of lighting through the decades. He collected light bulbs during his career which featured in exhibitions at the Science Museum and the Institute for Engineering and Technology. The collection had originally been . donated to the science museum but is believed to have been put up for . auction because the bulbs would have been too awkward to display and . maintain. Bright: Despite most of the light bulbs coming from Britain, these orange and blue bulbs hail from France.  They also have a decorative patterned glass and, as is typical of many bulbs which we use today, they have a standard bayonet connection . Classic: These double-filament bulbs show the intricate, fragile filaments inside which provide the bulb's light.  The bulbs are classically designed and are likely to have come from Britain . Most of the light bulbs are British, although the coloured bulbs with decorative glass come from France. It . is unknown exactly how Mr Collins came by the bulbs, although he is . said to have been part of a collectors circle who traded the rare . objects. Mr Lay said . the rarest bulb up for auction dated from 1900 and had four special . 'tier' filaments made from platinum and an unusual metal called . tantalum. This enabled it to glow for much longer than its predecessors and makes it 'extraordinarily rare' today. Inventive: Auctioneer David Lay described the large collection of light bulbs as 'rare and unusual'. The double filaments inside these two bulbs are extremely elaborate compared to a standard bulb. The filaments on the bulb on the left extend virtually the length of the bulb. The bulb on the right has a unique chocolate colour . Bold: The auctioneer said the collection gives a 'fascinating glimpse' of early lighting technology . This French bulb on the left is likely to give off a dim glow and was made for decorative purposes. Unlike many of these bulbs, the one on the right has a screw fitting and resembles a snow globe with its decorative flecks . He said:'I think it probably is the finest collection of antique light bulbs that has ever gone up for auction . 'It's a worldwide collection but the bulbs are mostly British. We had some bulbs on sale which look as if they have four tiers of support - these are very sought after. 'They have got platinum and another metal called tantalum - they were the next stage on from a carbon filament. 'That gave a long-life bulb, but they are extraordinarily rare - they date from about 1900. 'The coloured bulbs are French and were made for decorative purposes. Mr Lay added: 'Bill Carlton was just steeped in this world - light bulbs were just his working life and private life it seems. 'He bequeathed them to the . science museum, but they didn't want it because it was too much hassle. Most of them use a standard bayonet connection that we have today. 'Collectors who buy the bulbs want their filaments to work. They aren't interested in a bulb whose filament doesn't. 'They pass a low voltage through it, and you get a very dull glow.' Asked how the buyer would be able to collect their fragile purchase intact, Mr Lay said: 'The buyer is going to come and get them himself. 'I think they're going to be packed carefully in a lot of smaller boxes.' Auctioneer David Lay inspects some of the 500 lightbulbs set to go under the hammer this week .

Recovery: Madonna Badger smiles - nearly a year since her children and parents died in a Christmas Day fire . Moving on: Speaking to Matt Lauer, she said visions of her children have helped her with her grief . 'Lily came to me very early on and said to me, 'Don't worry mommy, I'm right there in your heart, and I love you"". 'Once when I was having level 10 - the . worst sort of cries, when it feels like blood is coming out of my eyes - Sarah . came to me in the mirror and said, ""There's nothing to be afraid of"".' While . Mrs Badger admitted that she first thought she 'was a little nuts' for the . visions, she said she realised it was important to for her heeling, and . professional help and readings have allowed her to accept it. 'I'm doing really well, I'm shocked that I'm doing OK, but I'm doing really well,' she said, smiling. Loss: The blaze claimed the lives of (left to right) seven-year-old twins Grace and Sarah and Lily, nine . Missed: Her parents, Lomer and Pauline Johnson, were also killed on Christmas Day last year . In . her last interview with the Today show, in June, Mrs Badger had struggled to . contain her emotions as she recounted her Christmas Day preparations . with her children, her mother and Borcina. When the couple went to bed, they put . fireplace ashes in a box inside a mud room. Despite Borcina running . his hands through the ashes to check for heat, the $1.7 million home ignited, killing . the children and their grandparents, Pauline and Lomer Johnson, in the early hours of Christmas Day. Following their deaths, Badger said she went to three mental institutions and considered suicide, but the support of her friends helped her get through. She moved in with one of her friends in Little Rock, Arkansas - where she still lives - for four months when 'half my hair had fallen out'. Inferno: The fire was started by still-smouldering fireplace embers left inside the Connecticut mansion . 'I was a disaster,' she said. 'They made me promise I wouldn't kill myself. They brought me back to life.' And as Christmas - and the . anniversary of that tragic day - looms, she has made plans to go to . Thailand, which is a 'Santa Claus-free zone'. 'I'm going to work in an orphanage with young girls who've lost their families and bring toys from my garage that belonged to my children,' she said. 'I'm going to pray and meditate and be with my kids and love them and do the very best I can.' She added that she no longer contemplates suicide because she doesn't 'know what would happen if I did that and I don't want to risk not being with my children'. Grief: Madonna Badger cries left with her ex-husband Matthew at the funeral of their three daughters, while she is pictured, right, with her then-boyfriend Michael Borcina, who also survived the blaze . Missed: Mrs Badger said the girls come to her and comfort her, which helps her know they are always with her . Her interview comes just days after her . ex-husband and the father of the girls, Matthew Badger, said he felt as . if he wanted to kill her and her boyfriend following the tragedy. 'I thought that was perfectly normal,' she told Lauer. 'I . certainly felt the same way. I don't judge Matthew's grief. In fact, I am incredibly proud of him for what he's done with the .

'Truly exceptional': This sword-pistol, which is believed to have been used by Lord Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar, is going up for auction . A sword-pistol thought to have been brandished by Lord Nelson in the Battle of Trafalgar is set to fetch up to £15,000 when it goes up for auction tomorrow. The weapon was discovered in a collection of his possessions owned by his closest friend Alexander Davison. The silver mounted D.B. flintlock tap-action weapon with attached 69.4cm blade was made by H.W. Mortimer in 1805. Ben Gamble, head auctioneer at Cuttlestones, said: 'This is a truly exceptional piece of British history with a very interesting back story. It is a very fine, rare item in its own right. 'Pistols of this period and quality and by makers of this caliber do not often come up for sale and its links to Nelson are only set to broaden its appeal. 'To say we’re excited by the prospect of selling this piece is an understatement. 'All the evidence said it did belong to him and came back from Trafalgar with Hardy, the captain of the Victory. 'The likelihood is Nelson would have used it in Trafalgar.' He said the sword-pistol was battle-worn and had suffered some damage, but could be made to work again by a good gunsmith. Mr Gamble added: 'It’s quite unusual, they were fashionable for a short period of time. They weren’t that practical to use, only high-ranking officers had them. 'The idea was you would try and shoot the enemy first but if they got too close or you couldn’t fire, you had a chance of using your sword - a simpler form of bayonet. 'Naval collectors would be interested in owning this item. Nelson is a significant historical figure. 'It’s a beautiful item - it’s such a fascinating object - the workmanship is incredible. You could be holding something used my Nelson in battle.' Nelson met Davison, the son of a Northumbrian farmer, in Quebec in 1782. Rich history: The weapon was discovered in a collection of his possessions owned by Lord Nelson's closest friend Alexander Davison . Finest quality: The silver-mounted D.B. flintlock tap-action weapon with attached 69.4cm blade was made by H.W. Mortimer in 1805 . 'Interesting story': The auctioneer says all the evidence points to the weapons belonging to Nelson and came back from Trafalgar with Hardy, the captain of HMS Victory . Ready for restoration: The weapon is battle-worn and has suffered some damage, but could be made to work again by a good gunsmith . A sword-pistol is a sword with pistol or revolver attached alongside the blade. Unlike a rifle and bayonet, the two components cannot usually be separated. As a general rule of thumb, it also differs from bayonet-fixed rifles in that it is mainly used as a sword with the gun being deployed as a secondary weapon, although this was not always the case. A young post-captain at the time, . Nelson was escorting supplies to the British army fighting the . rebellious American colonists to the south. The pair became good friends and after his victory at the Battle of the Nile in 1798, Nelson made Davison his prize agent. It was a highly lucrative appointment . that made Davison responsible for negotiating the sale of any enemy . ships captured during action. The proceeds were then distributed among Nelson and his men. In 1804, Davison was jailed for six months for election fraud after trying to bribe himself a seat in parliament and found guilty of fraud again five years later for falsifying purchase orders and receipts. Supreme commander: Lord Nelson led the British to victory over the French and Spanish navies at Trafalgar was fatally injured during the battle . Decisive: A painting of Trafalgar where 27 British ships defeated 33 French and Spanish ships off the south-west coast of Spain . Upon his release, he lived quietly in Brighton until his death in 1829 at the age of 79. Lord Nelson joined the Royal Navy at . the tender age of 12 through the influence of his uncle Maurice Suckling . and was given command of his first ship more than 20 years later. He lost his right eye and right arm . on active service but continued to inspire his men in subsequent . battles, three of which - at the Nile (1798), Copenhagen (1801) and . Trafalgar (1805) - were the most decisive in British history. During the Battle of Trafalgar, Nelson was hit by a French sniper and mortally wounded. His body was brought back to England where he was given a state funeral.

Lyn Hughes, however, had a shock when one turned up outside her door – of his own free will. Fortunately for the bird, which had escaped from a nearby farm in Worcester, Mrs Hughes, 62, already had one of his friends in her freezer and had no need for additional dinner table fare. Instead she simply took some photographs to record the moment. A great escape: This turkey escaped a local farm before being spotted by residents running around a suburban neighbourhood in Worcester . Plucky bird: Lyn Hughes discovered the turkey hiding behind shrubs on her driveway on Chelmsford Drive . Yesterday, Mrs Hughes told how a young boy called at her home on Chelmsford Drive to ask 'have you seen a turkey walking around the estate?' She initially dismissed the door-knock as a prank and shut the door - but when she saw the worried lad still outside she went out to investigate. Retired Mrs Hughes said: 'I asked him where the turkey was and he said it was hiding behind a bush. He then took me to where it was. 'All I could see was these black feathers and all of a sudden he reared up and emerged from the bush. A new home: The RSPCA managed to capture the bird - which has since been nicknamed Tommy the Turkey - and take him to a local bird sanctuary . 'Imagine the shock when he ran out in front of me and started strutting around. 'The young lad had stayed out there for hours with the bird while he waited for someone to come out. Mysterious: A spokesperson for the RSPCA said it's unlikely they will ever know where the bird came from . 'He was clearly upset at the thought of the turkey being out all night and worried a fox would probably get it. 'At one point he even tried to catch it and put it in his own garden. 'I told him he had done everything he possibly could for the turkey and that he deserved a medal for his efforts. 'I had my own turkey already so when it walked up the drive I thought ""oh no, I’ve got one of his mates in the freezer"".' The RSPCA were called to the street on November 28 and managed to catch Tommy before taking him to a nearby animal sanctuary. A charity spokesperson said the bird had been taken to the vet and checked over but they did not know where it came from. She said: 'We were asked to come and retrieve a black male turkey after a member of the public had corralled him in to a garden. 'An inspector and and animal collection agent arrived and took the bird to an animal rescue centre nearby. 'At this time of year a lot of people who wouldn’t normally do so farm turkeys on an ad-hoc basis. 'Perhaps a local farmer had been keeping them in a spare field and this one managed to escape. 'If their wings aren’t clipped properly they can easily get over a fence and make a run for it. 'So it’s likely that it’s a farm turkey but we won’t ever know for certain.'","Turkey was spotted by residents on Chelmsford Drive in Worcester .

Mrs Boughton was taking Sam and her other two other sons, Louis and Tom, for a half-term day out when the tragedy struck. An inquest into their deaths at Hereford Town Hall on Tuesday heard the mother-of-three and her eldest son died as a result of a 'momentary oversteer' caused by mud on the road. Tragedy: Kate Boughton (left) and her son Sam (right) were killed in front of her two other boys when their car ploughed head-on into a tractor as she lost control of her car on a muddy road near Leominster, Herefordshire . Mrs Boughton's children were were playing bingo when she lost control of the car and veered straight into the path of the two tonne farm vehicle. Front seat passenger Sam, who was a pupil at John Beddoes High School in Presteigne, Powys, died at the scene, while his mother  died shortly after being flown to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. Louis and Tom, who were in the back of the car, suffered serious injuries but survived. The horrific smash was described at the time as one of the worst collisions Herefordshire Fire and Rescue Service had ever seen. Crash investigator PC Neil Taylor, of West Mercia Police, said he believed Mrs Boughton lost control of the car when mud on the road caused her to oversteer. Emergency workers at the scene of the fatal road traffic accident near Lucton on the B4362 where Kate Boughton and her son Sam were killed. Helicopters: Two air ambulances arrive at the scene of the fatal collision . He said: 'The most cause for the concern was the contamination of mud on the road surface coming from the side of the road the Corsa was on. 'It was a thin layer of mud and had been compacted by the time I arrived, but I don’t know if that was caused by the sheer number of emergency vehicles that attended the scene. 'I believe the mud deposits caused a momentary oversteer situation.' Inquest: A coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death, after ruling there were no faults with the car and that the tractor driver had done nothing to cause the crash . The inquest heard a road sign warning drivers about the muddy conditions had been put out but according to PC Taylor, its location was 'insufficient' to give motorists time to react. A team of 20 firefighters used hydraulic cutting equipment and spent an hour releasing the family from the wreckage.

Accused: Kildup Singh, QC, was clocked going through a red light at speed 1.4 seconds after it had changed to stop . A High Court judge accused of jumping a red light at more than double the speed limit is battling to have his case thrown out claiming it is 'oppressive'. Kuldip Singh QC, 58, was clocked racing through a central London junction at 64mph in his 3.2 litre C-Class Mercedes Benz a full 1.4 seconds after the light had turned red. However, the Deputy High Court Judge, who also sits on the FA disciplinary panel, said prosecutors have been 'misleading and manipulative' in the legal action against him. The case has already been listed seven times and had four hearings - but Singh is yet to enter a plea for the offence which happened in November last year. At one stage he claimed the device used to catch him was not Home Office approved but later dropped this argument. Singh even complained about his right to a fair trial and cited Article 6 of the Human Rights Act during his latest appearance. Andrew Perry, prosecuting at Westminster Magistrates Court, said: 'This case has dragged on because the defendant didn’t put his hands up at the outset and has sought to claim there was something wrong with the criteria being operated by City of London Police - there is not.' Singh argues the case should be dropped because he was not given the option of paying an on-the-spot fine and official guidelines show speed should not have been taken into account when the decision was taken to prosecute. Representing himself he said: 'These proceedings should never have been brought on the basis that they were - I should not be before the court.' He allegedly committed the offence driving his black Mercedes along a 30mph stretch of Farringdon Street at its junction with Stonecutter Street in the City of London. He is not charged with speeding. Mr Perry, an expert in the field who advises both the CPS and ACPO, told the judge the case had been reviewed at the highest levels, said: 'Due to the time the signal was red the defendant would have been prosecuted, he would not have received a fixed penalty notice anywhere in the country.' He added that Singh's speed was 'clearly a relevant consideration'. Mr Perry said: 'It is a serious case of crossing a red traffic light.' District Judge Quentin Purdy was been handed three lever arch folders stuffed with documents by the Singh as part of his defence. Singh, who qualified as a barrister in 1975 and was appointed Queen’s Counsel in 1993, said: 'These proceedings have become oppressive and ought to be stopped.' Protracted: Kuldip Singh, QC, arriving at Westminster Magistrates Court with his legal adviser. The case has alraedy been listed seven times and had four hearings but he is yet to enter a plea . He also complained that getting documents from the prosecution had been like 'pulling teeth'. However, Mr Perry said: 'The defendant has built his abuse argument on sand, an incorrect statement of law, and then has tried to discredit the prosecution as they deal with his shifting assertions.' Singh, whose address was given in court as his chambers, Serle Court, at New Square, Camden, north London, has not formally entered a plea to a single count of contravening a red traffic light. District Judge Purdy, who noted a 'huge amount of court time' had already been taken up by the case, will give his ruling on January 29.

Jailed: Arms dealer Gary Hyde, 41, was found guilty of shipping weapons to Nigeria without a licence and then hiding his profits from UK authorities . An arms dealer who helped ship thousands of AK47 assault rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from China to Nigeria has been jailed for seven years. Gary Hyde, 43, moved the weapons without a licence and hid more than one million US dollars - £620,460 - in commission payments. Hyde, from Newton on Derwent, near York, looked tearful as he was sentenced at . London’s Southwark Crown Court following his conviction for two counts . of breaching UK trade controls and concealing criminal property. The deal between the two countries’ governments was lawful, but Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith said middleman Hyde was caught out by his own greed. He failed to apply for a licence to take part in the deal, fearing it would be refused, but also because he was attracted by the 'enormous profits' to be made, the judge said. Hyde, who was supported in court by his family, legitimately ran and expanded wholesale business York Guns to the point where it employed 20 staff in 2003. He helped broker various arms deals including some for the British Government. But in 2006 he got involved in the deal between China and Nigeria which saw up to 40,000 AK47s, 30,000 rifles and 10,000 9mm pistols go to the African nation along with 32 million rounds of ammunition. Prosecutor Mukul Chawla QC said: ‘This . case is about the shipment of huge quantity of guns and ammunition from . China to Nigeria in 2007. ‘That shipment, because it was being . partly arranged and organised from the UK by Gary Hyde, required the . permission of the Department for Business, Innovation, and Skills in the . form of a licence. ‘Mr Hyde, despite knowing that such a . licence was required, helped to organise that shipment without seeking . and obtaining the required licence. ‘This was not an oversight but, say the prosecution, a deliberate and calculated breach of the law. ‘In order to ensure that his illegal . activities were not drawn to the attention of the UK authorities he . placed, and thus concealed, the profits from this illegal trade in to a . bank account in Liechtenstein.’ Hyde was convicted after a retrial on . two counts of becoming knowingly concerned in the movement of controlled . goods between March 2006 and December 2007. Arms trading: Hyde oversaw the shipment of 40,000 AK47s, stock image above, from China to Nigeria . Hyde was jailed for seven years at Southwark Crown Court, London, pictured, for two counts of breaching UK trade controls and concealing criminal property . He was also found guilty of one count of concealing criminal property between March 2006 and December 2008 after he hid the profits in a bank in Liechtenstein. Hyde, who was of previous good character and served as a special constable for seven years, was also reluctant to apply for a licence lest the UK authorities discovered his tax haven account and his 'very substantial earnings', the judge said. He told him: 'You got carried away by the enormous profits that could be made elsewhere and, it would seem, in some less responsible company. 'I accept you opened your account in Liechtenstein to reduce your tax liability in lawful ways but it was there conveniently for you to launder the money from this unlawful deal.' The judge added: “Applying for a licence would have been easy. There was no evidence you would have got one, the question was never asked. I suspect you thought you would not. 'If you had, you would have also been concerned about the UK authorities finding out about your very substantial earnings.'","Gary Hyde oversaw the shipment of 40,000 AK47s, 30,000 rifles,10,000 9mm pistols and 32 million rounds of ammunition to the African nation .

Mr Cable, the Lib Dems’ former Treasury spokesman and now Business Secretary, has been pushing for a mansion tax ever since gaining office. George Osborne humiliated his Lib Dem colleagues Danny Alexander (left), Nick Clegg (right) and Vince Cable by brutally dismissing their hopes for a mansion tax in his Autumn Statement today . Grimace: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg pulls a face as Osborne dashes the Lib Dems hopes of introducing a 'mansion tax' Mocking: Labour front benchers laugh as Nick Clegg pulls faces in response to George Osborne's Autumn Statement . The plan would see an annual levy of 1 per cent on homes worth more than . £2million – penalising pensioners who have lived in their house for . years. Earlier in the year, he was still arguing for the plan, saying: . ‘A mansion tax is still very much on the agenda – it is a very good . idea. ‘It is good for two reasons. It would constitute a tax on wealth rather . than income, which we believe to be right, and also in economic terms it . creates the right sort of incentives for the property market.’ But Mr Osborne revealed crushingly yesterday that Mr Cable had failed to argue the Lib Dem case in Cabinet.

Mr Cable told Sky News he was disappointed to have lost the battle over a . mansion tax – but said it was part of a ‘very sensible compromise’. ‘The changes that have been introduced on pension tax are substantial,’ he said. ‘There was a trade-off within the Coalition.

An angry ice cream seller, who deliberately rammed a rival’s van and broke her equipment during constant rows about their ‘patch’, has been jailed for six months. Steffan Debattista, 20, reversed his van into rival Maxine Catalano’s, 49, vehicle in Dudley, West Midlands. During another attack, just 11 days later, he leant into the vehicle and broke the lever off her ice cream dispenser, flooding the van with £600 worth of ice cream. Ice cream war: Ice cream seller Steffan Debattista (right) was jailed for six months after he rammed rival Maxine Catalano's (left) ice cream van and broke the lever off her ice cream dispenser, flooding her van with £600 worth of ice cream . Debattista, of Lower Gornal, was arrested after a note of his registration plate on his bright red van was made by a member of the public when he sped off with this chimes still ringing following the road rage attack on September 4. He was bailed by police for damaging Miss Catalano’s ‘Super Whip’ van, but 11 days later struck again by targeting the van's dispenser as Maxine sold ice cream. Pulling up in his car, Debattista angrily told Miss Catalano that she should not be selling ice cream on his patch and demanded her boss's phone number. When the woman from Rowley Regis, West Midlands refused, he leant into the window as children looked on and broke her machine by pulling off the handle. Debattista was jailed for six months . at Wolverhampton Crown Court after been found guilty by a jury of . dangerous driving on Tuesday. He had previously admitted a charge of . criminal damage to Miss Catalano's van. The court heard how Debattista launched the hate campaign to scare her out of making sales in the area he considered his patch. Judge Nicholas Webb told him: ‘This kind of behaviour is serious and you deserve absolutely no credit for your stance. ‘This was prolonged dangerous driving culminating in a collision and what you did must mean custody. ‘The victim was in the business of selling ice cream and you disapproved strongly of the competition she posed. Hate campaign: Debattista's ice cream van is parked outside his house after he was jailed for the harassment he put Miss Catalano through to scare her out of making sales in the area he considered his patch . ‘You set about trying to scare her from selling ice cream to members of the public. ‘You deliberately reversed into her vehicle causing several hundreds of pounds damage when you knew she was in the vehicle with a passenger. ‘Not satisfied with that 11 days later you encountered her again. ‘You went to her ice cream machine and you manipulated the lever to the ice-cream dispenser and you poured it all over the floor. ‘People who drive like this has got to realise it will be taken extremely seriously by the courts. Fortunately no-one suffered any serious injury.’ Miss Catalano said that both she and her niece received back and neck injuries during the attack and she said she had been too frightened to sell ice cream regularly but will now start selling again after his sentencing yesterday. After the case, Miss Catalano described her attacker as ‘arrogant’.

He was trying to cut in front of me and to ram me. ‘There aren't any laid down areas where you can sell and I have never had any problems with any other ice cream seller. We all normally agree amicably about where we stop to sell and at what time. ‘When we stopped at some traffic lights outside the old he parked adjacent.’ She said that she continued to drive around the nearby area to try and dodge him with the police emergency services on her intercom in the van as she reported the drama. Just when she thought she had lost her tormenter he pulled out of a side street directly in front of her.

She said: ‘He's been depressed and I'm worried about him being in prison - he's never been away from home on his own before. ‘The sentence is so unfair and harsh. Nobody was hurt and I don't believe he did what was claimed in court.’ Debattista was also banned from driving for two years and was ordered not to have any contact order with Miss Catalano or her ice cream firm.","Steffan Debattista, 20, reversed his van into Maxine Catalano's vehicle .

The producers of The Hobbit have come under fire from wranglers after 27 animals used on set during the filming of the trilogy have died. While no animals were harmed during the actual filming, wranglers claim the production company is still responsible for the deaths because the animals were kept at a nearby farm filled with bluffs, sinkholes and other 'death traps'. Four wranglers working with the animals claim they repeatedly raised concerns about the farm peppered with bluffs, sinkholes and broken-down fencing with their superiors and the production company, owned by Warner Bros., but it continued to be used. Scroll down to watch trailer . On set: Wranglers claim 27 animals used on set, pictured above, died because of poor conditions at the nearby farm they were kept at . Concerned: Wrangler Chris Langridge claims the farm chosen to house animals used during the filming of The Hobbit, starring actor Martin Freeman pictured above as Bilbo, was filled with sinkholes and 'death traps' Wrangler Chris Langridge said he was hired as a horse trainer in November 2010, overseeing around 50 horses, but immediately became concerned that the farm was full of 'death traps'. He said he tried to fill in some of the sinkholes, made by underground streams, and even brought in his own fences to keep the horses away from the most dangerous areas but many were still injured. The first horse to die, he said, was a miniature named Rainbow. Mr Langridge added: 'When I arrived at work in the morning, the pony was still alive but his back was broken. He'd come off a bank at speed and crash-landed. He was in a bad state.' Rainbow, who had been slated for use as a hobbit horse, was euthanized. A week later, a horse named Doofus got caught in some fencing and sliced open its leg. That horse survived, but Mr Langridge said he'd had enough. He and his wife, Lynn, who was also working as a wrangler, said they quit in February 2011. The following month, they wrote an email to Brigitte Yorke, the Hobbit trilogy's unit production manager, outlining their concerns. Speaking out: While wranglers insist no horses were harmed on set, they claim three horses died because of the poor conditions at the farm where they were housed . Chris Langridge said he responded to Yorke's request for more information but never received a reply after that. A spokesman for trilogy director Peter Jackson today acknowledged that horses, goats, chickens and one sheep died at the farm near Wellington, New Zealand, where about 150 animals were housed for the movies. Spokesman Matt Dravitzky added some of the deaths were from natural causes but confirmed that the deaths of two horses were avoidable. He said the production company moved quickly and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars upgrading housing and stable facilities to improve conditions at the farm after they died. He said: 'We do know those deaths were avoidable and we took steps to make sure it didn't happen again.' He said the company no longer leases the farm and has no animals left on the property. He said he didn't know if animals will be needed for future filming in the trilogy, but added that Jackson himself adopted three of the pigs used. New home: The Hobbit director Peter Jackson has since adopted three of the pigs used during the filming of the movies . Other wranglers caring for the animals used during the making of the film have also spoken out. Wrangler Johnny Smythe said that soon after his colleague Mr Langridge left, a horse named Claire was found dead with its head submerged in a stream after it fell over a bluff. After that, he said, the horses were put in stables, where a third horse died. Mr Smythe said no autopsy was performed on the horse, which was named Zeppelin. Veterinary records say the horse died of natural causes, from a burst blood vessel, but Smythe said the horse was bloated and its intestines were full of a yellow liquid. He believes it died of digestive problems caused by new feed. Mr Smythe added that he buried six goats and six sheep after they fell into sinkholes, contracted worms or died after getting new feed because all the grass had been eaten. He said the chickens were often left out of their enclosure and that a dozen were mauled to death by dogs on two separate occasions. Mr Smythe said he was fired in October 2011 after arguing with his boss about the treatment of the animals. Making changes: A spokesman for the film director Peter Jackson said action was taken at the farm near Wellington, New Zealand, to remedy the situation after the 'avoidable' deaths of two horses . Investigation: The production company reported the incidents at the farm to the American Humane Association which made several recommendations to improve the farm facilities . A fourth wrangler, who didn't want to be named because she feared it could jeopardize her future employment in the industry, said another horse, Molly, got caught in a fence and ripped her leg open, suffering permanent injuries. The American Humane Association, which has been overseeing animal welfare on the films, currently only monitors film sets but not the facilities where the animals are housed and trained. The Association said the wranglers' complaints highlight a fault in its oversight system. The AHA said in its report on 'An Unexpected Journey' that it investigated the farm in August 2011 at the production company's request. Mark Stubis, an association spokesman, said: 'We made safety recommendations to the animals' living areas. Back again: Actor Ian McKellen, pictured on The Hobbit set in costume as Gandalf, also appeared in The Lord Of The Rings movies . 'The production company followed our recommendations and upgraded fence and farm housing, among other things.' Mr Stubis said the association acknowledges that what happens off-set remains a blind spot in its oversight. He said: 'We would love to be able to monitor the training of animals and the housing of animals. It's something we are looking into. We want to make sure the animals are treated well all the time.' 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey', the first movie in the planned $500 million trilogy, is scheduled to launch with a red-carpet premiere  in Wellington later this month. The film will then open at theaters around the world in December. The animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals says it's planning protests at the premieres in New Zealand, the U.S. and the UK. Highly anticipated: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first installment of the trilogy and will be released later this year .","Wranglers caring for the animals claim the farm they were kept at near Wellington, New Zealand, was full of bluffs, sinkholes and other 'death traps'

Italian mobsters shot dead a rival gangster in the courtyard of an Italian nursery as dozens of children rehearsed their Christmas carol service nearby. Victim Luigi Lucenti, 50, had been fleeing the attackers when he was chased into the nursery by masked gunmen and shot several times at point-blank range. The murderers eventually escaped on a powerful motorbike and police said it was a miracle that nobody was injured. Coldblooded: Luigi Lucenti, 50, had been fleeing masked gunmen when they chased him into a nursery in Naples' Scampia district and killed him . Terrified pupils and teachers dived for cover as the hitmen struck and TV footage showed a huge pool of blood on the floor where Lucenti had been shot. The killing happened at a nursery in the Scampia district of Naples - home to the notorious local mafia known as the Camorra. The area is at the centre of a bloody turf war between mobsters over the control of lucrative drug markets. Lucenti, is the latest victim in a feud which has seen dozens killed as the Scissionisti gang, who Lucenti was linked to, fought it out with rivals the Girati. Only last week an innocent man was shot dead after being mistaken by hitmen as an opposing gang member. A Naples police spokesman said: 'It appears that Lucenti ran into the nursery thinking that his killers would not follow him inside but they did and they shot him several times at point blank range in the courtyard.' 'The children and teachers were inside at the time and it is a miracle that no-one else was hurt. The children were inside singing carols for the Christmas performance. Aftermath: Police outside the nursery school afte the ambush by members of the Camorra, a mafia-style organisation operating in Naples, Italy. 'It looks like he was hit once in the street outside and then he ran into the nursery and was deliberately followed inside.' The school's headteacher Vincenzo Montesano said: 'The children were all led out through a secondary exit. They didn't see the shooting so we hope they will all be ok. We will just have to wait and see. It's lucky they were inside singing and not on a break otherwise things could have been very different.' Italy's Interior Minister Anna Maria Cancellieri said: 'Sadly Scampia is like an open wound. We are dealing with a battle that has gone on for a long time and will take time. The level of police officers will continue to remain high in the area and we will not weaken our stance.' Local councillor Angelo Pisani said: 'We strongly condemn this action but that's not enough. These beasts acted without any thought of the children who were in the nursery and who risked being caught up in what happened. What if the children had been outside? What if they had seen the body?'","Mafia chased Luigi Lucenti, 50, into nursery and shot him several times .

The icy waters of the Arctic would hardly be most people's first choice for a day at the the beach. But for these fearless surfers it provides the perfect destination for monster waves. The daredevils braved the chilly conditions in the crystal clear water as they enjoyed the powerful swells off the Lofoten Islands, in Norway. Surfers Dane Gudauskas, Alex Parker and Keith Malloy normally carve up the golden beaches of sunny California but made the trip to the Arctic, where temperatures as low as just 2-3C, after hearing about the smooth waves. Scroll down to see the video . Super cool: Surfer Keith Malloy carves up an icy wave in the Arctic, where the water temperature is as low as 2C. He's more used to the golden beaches of California . Don't catch a cold! Mr Malloy crouches in the barrel of one of the powerful waves. He's wearing a thick wetsuit, hood, gloves and shoes to prevent pneumonia . After putting his wetsuit on, surfer Mr Gudauskas , 26, walked the ice-covered road to the beach through snow as high as his waist - all just to reach the water's edge. They wear full wetsuits with shoes and hoods covering as much of their skin as possible. But Mr Gudauskas said that once the water hit his face it felt 'like fire'. They have to warm up before entering the water - and they contend with the risk of catching pneumonia. Breathtaking: One of the surfers performs a grab after getting some air on one of the less threatening of the Arctic waves. Behind him the stunning scenery makes for an impressive picture . Golden sun rays light up the sky, but the temperatures in the water and air are still dangerously low. The men had to take extra precautions to prevent them from catching pneumonia . Mr Gudauskas said: 'When the water hit any exposed skin it would burn like fire until your body temperature warmed up from paddling. Only then could you get the mojo working. 'The region is pretty cold I'd imagine by . any standard. The air was ranging from 2C to way lower depending on the . day and wind chill. 'Winds were very strong through the . valley and felt like they could cut you in half - it must have been . minus degrees fairly often and the water was probably 2-3C. Refreshing: A surfer rips up one of the waves beneath breathtaking backdrop of snow-covered mountains off the Lofoten Islands, in Norway . Extreme: One of the brave surfers performs a turn after dropping in to one of the waves. They have to warm up before entering the water if they are to survive the conditions . Foam from the clear turquoise waters sprays around the surfer as he trails a hand through the swell. They have to walk across rocky shores to reach the remote waves . It's a bit fresh out there: The clean powerful swells are rarely surfed in winter, when most people consider the water too cold to venture in to . 'It's a really strange sensation entering water that cold. We're wearing wetsuits between 5-7mm so the only parts that really feel the cold when you first enter is any exposed skin so mostly just your face. 'I remember it felt like fire - an insane sensation and very uncomfortable. If you had to duck under consecutive waves you would get a crazy headache and it felt like my eye sockets were physically swelling to the point I thought they might swell my eyes shut. 'I don't think it's too dangerous unless . you don't warm up. Although pneumonia would be pretty easy to get if . you don't know what you're doing and that can be serious. A rainbow appears through the mist of an Arctic . waterfall. Right, a surfer runs back through the water, no doubt in a . hurry for some warmer conditions . Beautiful: The temperatures in the water may be close to freezing, but the scenes of the Norther Lights are simply stunning . Remote: The three surfers survey the waters. They had to walk through the ice-covered road to the beach and through snow as high as his waist - all just to reach the water's edge . 'Overall it was an awesome challenge. We were there a week and a half and the weather spanned from full snow . white-outs, to melting snow on the hills, then right as we were leaving . we could barely drive from the house as a blizzard nearly snowed us in. 'I've been surfing relatively my whole life - I was always around the ocean and it has been a natural progression. 'But . this was extremely different from what we're used to here in . California, mainly just the harsh conditions but I loved it and every . part of it. Deadly power: Clear blue skies can be seen above the Arctic waves, which many people describe as 'unsurfable' during the winter months . Skills: The surfer performs a frontside turn on the right-hand break. The men said the water was so cold they felt a 'burning sensation' when it touched their exposed skin .

Boost: Large businesses yesterday scooped a £3billion tax cut which will slash corporation tax to the lowest rate of any major western economy. Chancellor George Osborne, left, is pictured yesterday . Large businesses yesterday scooped a £3billion tax cut which will slash corporation tax to the lowest rate of any major western economy. In a surprise move, George Osborne said the rate will drop to 21 per cent in 2014, sending a clear message that Britain is ‘open for business’. It is the fourth time the Chancellor has used either a budget or an autumn statement to cut the key corporate tax rate. In May 2010 – the month Mr Osborne became Chancellor – corporation tax was 28 per cent for large businesses which make profits of more than £300,000 a year. The tax cut is significant. Official figures, published yesterday by the Treasury, show it will save firms £415million in 2014/15, rising to £785million the following year. In the following two years, it will be worth £875million in each year, making a total of £2.96billion. The Chancellor, the son of two entrepreneurs, said he wanted Britain to have ‘the most competitive business tax regime of any major economy’. He said the tax cut was ‘an advert for our country that says, “Come here, invest here, create jobs here. Britain is open for business”.’ Richard Baron, head of taxation at the Institute of Directors, the business lobby group, said the move should help the private sector to create jobs at a time when unemployment is 2.5million. He added: ‘Reducing the tax burden for all businesses is the most straightforward way to help them expand and take on more staff.’ The Institute of Directors wants corporation tax to drop to 15 per cent. But experts warned yesterday of a sting in the tail of the corporation tax cut through a crippling back-door tax hike in business rates. Worrying: Big chains such as Clintons, Game, Peacocks, JJB and Comet, pictured, have either disappeared or have lost hundreds of outlets . Each year, the increase in business . rates, which comes into force in April, is linked to the previous . September’s RPI figure, which was 2.6 per cent. The massive increase will hit businesses, particularly small shops – many of which are struggling to survive. Stephen Robertson, director general of the British Retail Consortium, said he will continue to campaign for a freeze in business rates following two years of punishing increases. ‘The Chancellor’s failure to offer immediate support for struggling high streets by announcing a business rates freeze is disappointing. ‘A third successive, substantial rates hike will deliver a further blow to investment and job creation.’ Mr Robertson said recent increases had already hit the high streets, resulting in empty shops and redundancies. One in every nine shops is lying empty. Some 32 shops closed every day over the summer, raising the spectre of yet more high streets turning into ‘ghost towns’. Big chains such as Clintons, Game, Peacocks, JJB and Comet have either disappeared or have lost hundreds of outlets. As a result, town centres are seeing more pawnbrokers, bookmakers, charity shops, coffee shops, payday loan firms and convenience stores run by the ‘big four’ supermarkets. Firms struggling to survive the tough economic climate have been handed a huge increase in the value of their tax breaks for investment in new machinery. At present, they enjoy tax relief on £25,000 of investment each year. From 1 January, it will jump tenfold to £250,000 for the next two years in a move which will cost the Treasury nearly £1.6billion. But last night the Chartered Institute of Taxation called for ‘stability’, criticising the fact that the annual allowance has fluctuated over the past few years, knocking business confidence. Andrew Gotch, from the institute, said: ‘Businesses like certainty above everything and the chopping and changing of the annual investment allowance has been a problem.’ A Forum of Private Business spokesman said: ‘The increase is welcome but it is also a tacit admission that the decision to cut the same allowance to £25,000 this year was a wrong one. ‘Given that UK businesses are currently . sitting on £700billion of cash reserves, it could be argued that the . earlier actions of the Chancellor created a disincentive to invest . through 2012, at a time when business needs confidence to create . growth.’ In a further boost for business, . 500,000 small businesses will benefit from the Chancellor’s decision to . extend a crucial exemption which allows them to escape paying business . rates. Mr Osborne said the . small business rate relief holiday, which had been due to end in April, . will be extended by a year. It allows small firms with a rateable value . of up to £6,000 to pay no business rates, and cuts bills for larger . firms with a rateable value of up to £12,000. Mr . Osborne said 330,000 will pay no business rates at all, equal to an . average saving of £1,650, with a further 150,000 paying lower rates as a . result of the extension.","In a surprise move George Osborne said .

An increasingly confident Barack Obama has returned to his rhetoric of 2008, presenting himself as a challenger to the status quo who will change politics and railing against ‘lobbyists and special interests’ in Washington. Speaking before 10,000 people in the Democratic heartland of Boulder, Colorado, Obama, his voice hoarse, delivered a fiery 36-minute speech designed to whip up his base of voters and rekindle some of the magic of four years ago ahead of Tuesday's election. Scroll down for video . His youngest fan? Obama high-fives a young girl while meeting with supporters after speaking at a campaign event at Franklin County Fairgrounds in Hilliard, Ohio, today . Must win: Mitt Romney needs to take Virginia and Florida . Obama has edged ahead in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls by just 0.1 per cent and appears to have an advantage in the crucial swing state of Ohio. He is very much in contention too in Virginia and Florida, which his opponent Mitt Romney must win. But Obama is campaigning in Wisconsin, Colorado and Nevada, states he won easily in 2008 and which hoped would have been in the bag by now. If Ohio, Florida and Virginia fall, his aides calculate, these states might save him. ‘Back in 2008, when we talked about . change, I told you I wasn’t just talking about changing Presidents.  I . wasn’t just talking about changing parties,’ Obama said in Boulder. ‘I . was talking about changing our politics. ‘I ran because the voices of the American people - your voices - had been shut out of our democracy for way too long by lobbyists and special interests, and politicians who believe that compromise is a dirty word and who would say anything to win office, and do anything to stay in office.’ Change, again: Barack Obama brought up memories of the previous election campaign . Plans: Obama said 'the future doesn't have many lobbyists' Despite having included many former . lobbyists in his administration, Obama said: ‘The future doesn’t have . lobbyists. They’ll never have as many lobbyists as the vested interests. Never have as many lobbyists as the past does.’ Lobbyists, however, have been frequent and repeated visitors to the Obama White House. According to the Washington Post, Tim Hannegan, who lists Taser International as a client has been to the White House more than 30 times under Obama. Bill Samuel, lobbyist for the AFL-CIO, has been by more than 50 times. Michael Taylor, a lobbyist for the Monsanto corporation, has been 25 times. Former Senator. Chris Dodd, a lobbyists for the Motion Picture Association of America, has been more than a dozen times. But the populist rhetoric was lapped up by the crowd as Obama promised 100,000 new ‘math and science teachers’ and training for two million workers. Aiming high: Obama pledged training for two million workers and more teachers . Not the status quo: Romney said he was the real agent of change . Obama sought to seize back the mantle of change from Romney, who has recently claimed he is the real candidate of change and Obama represents the status quo in Washington. ‘I know what real change looks like, because I fought for it,’ Obama said. ‘I've got the scars to prove it. You have, too. And after all that we've been through together, Colorado, we sure as heck can't give up now.’ The argument is unlikely to persuade many swing voters, who have become jaded after four years of high unemployment, soaring debt and partisan gridlock in Washington. But it is a message that resonates among diehard Democrats, who Obama desperately needs to go to the polls. Obama also looked back to the Bush years, blaming his predecessor for the mess that he had spent ‘four years cleaning up’ and harking back to President Bill Clinton’s time in the White House from 1993 to 2001. ‘We know the ideas that worked,’ Obama said in Green Bay, Wisconsin. ‘We also know the ideas that don't work. Because in the eight years after Bill Clinton left office, his policies were reversed.’ Obama speaking in Boulder, Colorado .","President told 10,000 in Colorado that the future does not hold many lobbyists .

Sir Philip Green's Topshop and Topman business were today valued at a staggering £2 billion after the retail tycoon sold a 25 per cent stake in the fashion brands. The entrepreneur’s Arcadia Group, which also owns Bhs, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, netted £500 million after agreeing to sell the Topshop stake to American private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners. The high street magnate said the deal will help his group expand Topshop and Topman brands further across the US and internationally. Deal: Sir Philip Green, pictured with daughter Chloe, has agreed to sell a 25% stake in his successful Topshop and Topman business . Expansion: The deal will help fund Sir Philip's planned expansion of the popular high-street brand internationally . Sir Philip Green is the . multi-billionaire 'King of the High Street' who commutes to work by . private jet from the tax haven of Monaco. And . his tax affairs were brought into the spotlight in 2010 when he was . appointed by David Cameron as a government spending tsar charged with . finding Whitehall savings. Sir Philip, who left school at 15 to go into business, lives in London hotels during the week. But . his business empire is mostly owned in the name of his wife Tina . (pictured together above), who lives in the tax haven, where Sir Philip . spends his weekends. The couple moved there in 1998. In the past, he has joked that the vast sums paid into his wife's bank account are 'housekeeping money'. This set-up will have saved himself £125million in tax, experts have claimed. He . remains a UK taxpayer because he spends more than 90 days a year here . running his businesses but he ensured that when he bought Bhs in 2000 . and Arcadia in 2002, the transactions were in his wife's name. Mrs . Green has long been Monaco based with their children Brandon and Chloe, . meaning she escapes the tax rules for citizens living in the UK. There is nothing illegal in the set-up but he . arrangement is thought to have saved the couple tens of millions of . pounds in tax over the years. He famously paid his family a £1.2billion . dividend in 2005. Lady Tina was able to receive the dividend tax-free because she is an official resident of Monaco. Asked . about his wife's tax status he replied: 'My wife's not a tax exile - my . family do not live in the United Kingdom, it's somewhat different.' And . questioned over whether Britain would benefit from owners of British . businesses paying all their taxes in the country, Sir Philip added: 'We . do pay all our tax in Britain, I think we have paid over the last five . years some £300-400 million in taxes on profits that have been made on . our company. 'I'm a UK taxpayer, I work here every week, we employ 45,000 people in the UK and we have got a £500 million payroll.' Topshop - popular with budget shoppers and fashionistas alike - has been steadily increasing its international footprint in recent years and has 615 franchised shops across 39 countries. Sir Philip signalled a potential spending spree to come as he said the cash from the sale will remain in the Arcadia Group, leaving it debt-free and offering the 'flexibility to look at other opportunities'. He added: 'This is a very exciting time for the Arcadia Group, with a clear strategy now in place for Topshop/Topman to become major global players.' The £500million cash injection from the share issue, which waters down Green's controlling stake, will go straight into the company's coffers for expansion. Sir Philip's business empire is mostly owned in the name of his wife Tina, who lives in Monaco - where he spends his weekends. So had the family shares been sold this money would have gone into her pocket with little or no tax paid. Green famously paid his family a £1.2billion . dividend in 2005. Lady Tina was able to receive the dividend tax-free because she is an official resident of Monaco. The deal follows months of talks with Leonard Green & Partners, which has a history of retail investments in the US, including organic food group Whole Foods Market, fashion chain J.Crew, Neiman Marcus luxury department stores and pet products retailer Petco. In Arcadia's recent full-year figures, Sir Philip said international Topshop stores were performing well, with its fledgling Melbourne outlet on course for £15 million sales in its first year after record results. Shops in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Vancouver in Canada have also recorded strong opening performances. But the wider Arcadia group saw like-for-like retail sales fall 3.2% in the year to August 25 as it endured ""very challenging"" high street trading. The sales disappointment was offset by moves to sell less discounted stock, which helped improve margins and grow underlying full-year profit by 25% to £166.9 million from £133.1 million the previous year. Trading since the summer also picked up, with comparable store sales up 0.7%, including VAT, in the 10 weeks of its new financial year. Topshop and Topman have become one of the biggest successes on the UK high street, partly as a result of a lucrative collaboration with supermodel Kate Moss who designed her own clothing collection for the store. The launch of her line in 2007 saw the biggest single day of trading Topshop.com had ever seen. The chain has also been hailed for  its skill in spotting the latest fashion trends and quickly getting them on to  its shelves. Ahead of the sale a friend of the tycoon said: ‘You would be wrong to suggest Sir Philip is going to use this deal to take cash out of the business. This is about investing in a big push for Topshop and Topman internationally.’ Prior to the announcement Sir Phillip was ranked with his family at number 17 on the Sunday Times rich list with an estimated fortune of £3.3billion. Topshop started as Peter Robinson's Topshop in Sheffield in 1964, becoming a stand-alone shop in the 1970s . Sir Philip Green and his daughter Chloe at London Fashion Week. He took over the Arcadia Group, which includes the Topshop and Topman brands, in 2002 . Last month he signed up American . reality TV stars the Kardashian sisters in an attempt to boost the . fortunes of his Dorothy Perkins chain. The entrepreneur recently criticised . Britain’s battered retailers for feeling sorry for themselves, saying . there was ‘no use moping about’ and they should ‘get on with it’. But he has faced criticism himself over his tax arrangements. Sir Philip, who employs 45,000 people through Arcadia, says he always pays his tax in full. Topshop's recent success has been buoyed by the . involvement of model Kate Moss who launched her own clothing collection . in the store in 2007 .

The blunders that turned the West Coast rail franchise deal into 'a first-class fiasco' were laid bare yesterday. The former transport secretary, Justine Greening is pictured . The blunders that turned the West Coast rail franchise deal into ‘a first-class fiasco’ were laid bare yesterday. The first official reports into the auction found civil servants got their sums wrong when stripping Virgin Trains of the £7billion route. Ministers have been forced to start the tender process again – costing taxpayers tens of millions of pounds. An 84-page dossier by businessman Sam Laidlaw accused the Department for Transport of flawed and inadequate planning and producing inaccurate reports. However no individual officials or ministers were singled out for blame – a decision that led to claims of a whitewash. A second report from the Audit Commission flagged up high staff turnover at top levels at the transport ministry as well as job losses at lower levels. Yesterday the Government announced Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin company will continue to operate services on the London to Scotland route for another 23 months. The flawed tender process had given the contract to FirstGroup. Mr Laidlaw, chief executive of energy company Centrica, said there had been ‘a lack of transparency, inadequate planning and preparation, as well as a complex and confusing organisational structure with weak quality assurance and insufficient governance oversight’. He concluded: ‘The responsibility of this flawed process rests with the DfT rather than with any of its external advisers.’ Labour said ministers – including Justine Greening, who was Transport Secretary at the time but is now International Development Secretary – should take responsibility for their ‘shambolic and incompetent’ actions. Tory MPs demanded to know why the ‘Sir Humphreys’ at the heart of the scandal were still in post. Three middle-ranking civil servants suspended in connection with the botched deal have been reinstated. They include commercial and technical director Kate Mingay, who took her case to the High Court claiming she was a political scapegoat. Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Trains will now run the West Coast main line for another 23 months as ministers try to get a grip on the shambolic franchise process . Ministers say the blunder will cost taxpayers at least £40million. Rail unions put the figure at more than £100million. The Laidlow report shows that outside lawyers raised concerns seven weeks before FirstGroup won the contract on August 14. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin pulled the plug on plans to award the lucrative franchise to FirstGroup after serious failings were found in the decision process . It highlighted a ‘lack of clarity’, failure to warn superiors of mounting problems and a culture of ‘limited ownership’, ‘ineffective oversight’ and risks being ignored because of an overriding pressure to complete the procurement deal  on time. Mr Laidlaw said he could find no evidence of an anti-Virgin bias at the department but he admits his enquiries were hampered because he was not able to see all the emails he had asked for. He said the ministry was ‘excessively stretched’ due to the spending review and the competing pressures of other projects. The Audit Commission report said the department had had four permanent secretaries since 2010 and had been hit by staff reductions of up to 30 per cent. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, who published the Laidlaw report yesterday, told the Commons: ‘I do not hide from the seriousness of his findings. They make extremely uncomfortable reading for the department. ‘They caused serious problems for the bidding firms, including FirstGroup, who were in no way at fault.’ He said the Prime Minister had asked questions during the bidding process but there had been a ‘damning failure’ to provide accurate answers. Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons public accounts committee, said: ‘The DfT’s handling of the West Coast franchise was a first-class fiasco. It has left the Government’s entire policy on rail franchising in disarray.’ Manuel Cortes, of the TSSA rail union, said: ‘This is a classic Whitehall whitewash. No one was seriously guilty of anything.’ The West Coast main line is Britain's busiest rail route, connecting London to Liverpool, Manchester, Edinburgh and Glasgow .","Sir Richard Branson lost the right to run services to rival FirstGroup .

Tim Smits, 33, was knifed in the stomach and leg defending the victims, but the graphic designer has been told to return to Australia by the UK Border Agency. He was honoured by a national charity and given a citizenship award after he intervened to stop yobs picking on elderly women with shopping trollies in September last year. Deported: Tim Smits, 33, who was stabbed defending a pregnant woman and elderly passengers on a bus in London has been told to leave the UK . Mr Smits later applied for a compassionate extension to his visa after he spent months recovering from the violent attack. But despite being honoured by the Andrew Carnegie Hero Trust Fund and being given an Islington council citizenship award, the agency ruled against his application. Yesterday, Mr Smits, originally from Melbourne, told the Mail: ‘I’m disgusted by the Border Agency’s decision. It’s very difficult to swallow. ‘It seems back to front that terrorists like Abu Qatada can stay in Britain but that people who risk their lives for their community are told to pack their bags. ‘It’s been a pretty rough year for me since the attack and this letter was the nail in the coffin.’ He said that the stress of the violent attack coupled with the Border Agency’s letter had caused him to have a breakdown and had prevented him from working for the last 14 months. He added: ‘’The most disgusting thing . is that when they rejected my appeal, they said my experience wasn’t . compassionate or compelling enough for them to make an exception. ‘It has made me question whether I really want to live in a country that wants to kick me out. ‘This has messed up all my plans.

Injured: Mr Smits was stabbed in the leg during the incident . He has also helped to organise a creative festival for disillusioned young men to try to steer them away from a life of crime, but has had to put the project on hold following the letter. In September last year, Mr Smits, who lives in Hackney, said that he had stood up to a gang of yobs who were harassing elderly ladies and a pregnant woman on a bus. The gang shouted abuse at him on the journey between Dalston and Bromley-by-Bow and one member came over to his seat, stood over him and spat in his face. Mr Smits was hit in the head before he managed to pin his attacker’s arms, but he was then grabbed from behind and knifed before being taken to hospital. He was knifed by Sanchez Brown, then . 19, of Hackney, London, who was jailed at Snaresbrook crown court in . July after admitting wounding with intent. Blake Mehmet, also then 19 and of Hackney, was jailed for affray for punching Mr Smits. In an interview at the time, he said: ‘I’d do it again in a flash’ and said he was ‘unlucky this time’ because he was stabbed. ‘He threatened my life,’ said Mr . Smits. ‘I said, “Really? in front of all those witnesses on the bus in . broad daylight, you want to do that with witnesses?” Scene: The attack happened on a bus travelling from Dalston, north east London (file picture) ‘That’s when he really scared me by saying, “I don’t care - I’ll mess you up in front of all these people.”’ He added: ‘Getting into a fist fight is one thing but when there’s a weapon involved it’s like stop, stop, this stops now. ‘I don’t come from a well-off family, I come from a family that taught me good values and to respect people. Everything I have I have worked for and I just wish a lot of these kids would do the same.’ A UKBA spokesman said: ‘Mr Smits’s application was refused on October 11 this year. We had previously written to Mr Smits requesting details to support his application, however we did not receive a response. ‘He has chosen to appeal against this decision and proceedings are ongoing. It is only right that the rules apply to everyone.’","Tim Smits, 33, was knifed in the leg and stomach trying to protect a pregnant woman and elderly passengers on a bus .

One of Silicon Valley’s most valued men could soon become one of the president’s closest business confidants. Google Chairman Eric Schmidt is reportedly in line for a powerful position within the Obama administration. Schmidt, 57, the search giant’s former chief executive, may soon become secretary of Treasury or Commerce, or fill a new ‘secretary of business’ slot, the Washington Examiner reports. From the valley to the capital: Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt could be tapped by the Obama Administration to fill a high-power cabinet seat as a business confidant . Schmidt’s big role in the Obama re-election campaign, Google's $1.9 million donation to Democrats during the race, and Washington's efforts to quiet a looming Federal Trade Commission investigation into Google are key signs that the president wants Schmidt in his cabinet, insiders believe. ‘Nobody's better positioned for a Cabinet job, if he wants one,’ an unnamed Democratic strategist told the Examiner. Since Obama first ran for office five years ago, Google and Schmidt have stayed by his side with financial, political and technological support. Obama stopped by the company headquarters in Mountain View, California, in 2007 and told Google employees, ‘What we shared is a belief in changing the world from the bottom up, not from the top down.’ Old friends: Schmidt interviews Democratic Presidential hopeful Senator Barack Obama during a town hall meeting at Google headquarters in Mountain View, California on November 14, 2007 . Google's political action committee gave $1.6 million to Democrats in 2008 and only $300,000 to GOP candidates, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. This year the committee has given $2.1 million to Democrats and $715,000 to Republicans. Google donated more than $700,000 to Obama alone in the November’s election. When the President began asking Congress for a new round of stimulus spending in 2011, Schmidt helped promote the ‘jobs bill’ intended to help jumpstart the U.S. economy and help Americans hit hardest by the recession. ‘The economy is, today, stuck behind the power curve -- it needs a lot of encouragement,’ he said during a September 2011 interview on ABC’s ‘This Week with Christiane Amanpour.’ Without the jobs bill, he said, ‘We’re set up for years of extraordinarily low growth in the economy and no real solution to the jobless problem.’ As more political insiders and cabinet shakeup watchers forecast predictions of Schmidt taking a high-level cabinet seat, critics are paying close attention to the relationship between Google and the Obama administration, the Examiner reports. That’s a familiar story. Schmidt testified before a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 21, 2001, along with representatives of companies who were saying Google’s power is too great. Silicon Valley empire: A Google employee walks across the campus at Google headquarters, also known as the 'Googleplex,' in Mountain View, California .

The President's pick to fill a Republican spot on the FTC co-authored a paper in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy titled ‘Google and the Limits of Antitrust: The Case Against the Case against Google’ Now Obama and Schmidt could take their close ties behind closed doors. ‘Support in 2008, plus support in 2012, plus personal counsel by Schmidt to Messina in 2012, may now equal a plum cabinet post,’ one source told the Examiner.","Google's chairman and former CEO Schmidt, 57, is in line to become secretary of Treasury or Commerce, or fill a new ‘secretary of business’ slot, insiders say .

Concerns: Ronald Post, 53, does not have accessible veins in his arms, hands or legs because he is so obese, a doctor said . A 400lb death row killer is 'too fat' to receive a lethal injection, his doctor said in a court filing. Ronald Post, who is scheduled to die in January, does not have accessible veins in his arms, hands or legs because he is so obese, the doctor said. Post, 53, now wants a federal judge to . stop his execution on the grounds his weight could cause him to . suffer severe pain during the procedure. It is 'highly unlikely' that an IV could be placed in Post's legs and 'extremely unlikely' that veins could be found in his hands, Ohio State medical center anesthesiologist Sergio Bergese said in affidavit filed on Thursday. Post also has scars on his left and right forearms from a suicide attempt that make his veins inaccessible for an IV, Bergese added. The killer said his depression and scar tissue would also make it difficult for his executioners to administer a lethal injection. Post weighs more than 400lbs (28.5 stone), his doctor said, adding the killer had given blood in the past but had found it extremely difficult. Providing blood samples was no guarantee an IV could be inserted into Post's vein, the doctor added. Post was sentenced to death for shooting dead Helen Vantz in 1983. Vantz's son, Bill, has called Post's arguments 'laughable'. Fears: Post is worried executioners at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility will not be able to find a vein because of his weight . Arguments: Richard Cooey, who weighed 267lbs at the time of his execution in 2008, argued his own case of being too big to die while holding prison food and limited opportunities to exercise responsible . Escaped death: In 1994 Mitchell Rupe, who weighed 400lbs while sentenced to death, had his sentence changed to life in prison after found too heavy to hang without risking decapitation . The lethal injection, invented in 1977, is designed to kill a patient quickly and painlessly. The cocktail of drugs used varies from state to state, but generally it contains a barbiturate that induces a deep sleep; a paralysing agent that halts breathing; and potassium chloride, which stops the heart. However, dosages vary by state, not by inmate; people are given the same dosage regardless of their size. As a result the lethal injection is not necessarily quick or painless, a 2007 study published in PLoS Medicine found. If any of the doses in the injection are off the patient feels pain but also may suffer a slow death by asphyxiation, according to the study. Molecular biologist Teresa Zimmers of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, told the Scientific American at the time: 'This idea that this is a painless procedure is completely wrong. It's just invisible because the person is paralysed.' Post's . attorneys also want more time to pursue arguments that claims of a full . confession by the inmate to several people have been falsely . exaggerated. Post has tried losing weight, but knee and back problems have made it difficult to exercise, according to the court filing. Post's . request for gastric bypass surgery has been denied, he has been . encouraged not to walk because he's at risk for falling, and severe . depression has contributed to his inability to limit how much he eats, . his filing said. The state currently opposes Post's request. Before his execution in 2008, 266lb . (19-stone) death row inmate Richard Cooey also claimed Ohio authorities would have trouble finding a vein in his flab. In a lawsuit, Cooey argued that he would suffer a painful . death by lethal injection because of his size. However, his execution passed without any recorded incident. In . 1994 in Washington state, a federal judge upheld the conviction of . Mitchell Rupe, but agreed with Rupe's contention that at more than 400 . pounds, he was too heavy to hang because of the risk of decapitation. Rupe argued that hanging would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. After numerous court rulings and a third trial, Rupe was eventually sentenced to life in prison, where he died in 2006.","Ronald Post worried his weight will mean he suffers severe pain during procedure .

Abraham Shakespeare could barely read, wrote his name in block letters and had given away most of his $17 million in lottery winnings when he became friends with Dorice 'Dee Dee' Moore, a calculating woman who later became his financial adviser, prosecutors said Wednesday.During opening statements in Moore's first-degree murder trial in Tampa, assistant state attorney Jay Pruner said Moore swindled what was left of Shakespeare's winnings from his bank account in 2009, then killed him and buried his body under a concrete slab in her backyard.Pruner said when Shakespeare won the lottery, his life 'drastically and dramatically changed' — and that the money caused all sorts of problems, eventually leading to his death. On trial: Dorice ""Dee Dee"" Moore arrives in court at the Hillsborough County Courthouse for the opening statements in her case Wednesday . Big winner: Mr. Shakespeare collected his millions with his family by his side in 2006 . Moore, 40, wore a yellow button-down blouse and black pants to court, and her long, curly hair framed her face as she highlighted notes with a yellow marker during Wednesday's trial. Booked: Police said Dorice 'Dee Dee' Moore shot Shakespeare twice than his his body in concrete . Her attorney, Byron Hileman, said there is no evidence that ties his client to the gun used to shoot Shakespeare.'There are no eyewitnesses who can testify that Ms. Moore shot and killed Mr. Shakespeare or was present when he was shot and killed or had any part carrying out his murder,' Hileman said, adding that the evidence against Moore is mostly circumstantial.Both attorneys agreed on one thing: that by the time Shakespeare and Moore met, the man had already spent or given away most of his lottery winnings. Friends and acquaintances owed him millions of dollars, the lawyers said, and Pruner called him a 'soft touch.'Moore befriended Shakespeare in late 2008, claiming that she was writing a book 'about how people were taking advantage of him,' said Pruner.Prosecutors said Moore became his financial adviser, eventually controlling every asset he had left, including an expensive home, the debt owed to him and a $1.5 million annuity. Prosecutors said Moore got close to Shakespeare by telling him she was writing a book about his financial woes . Pruner said that during the trial, he will prove that Moore shifted money from Shakespeare's bank accounts to her own, and that she formed a company in his name — yet didn't allow him to withdraw money from the bank account attached to that company.In April 2009, Shakespeare disappeared. Pruner said he was shot, killed and buried under a 30-by-30-foot concrete slab in the back of Moore's home. Moore presented herself as a leggy blond in her social media profiles . Smith is expected to take the witness stand because he became a confidential informant and recorded numerous conversations and meetings with Moore — who told police various stories about her relationship with Shakespeare and his disappearance during several interviews.In January 2010, investigators searched Moore's property and found Shakespeare's decomposing body in Moore's backyard.Moore's attorney acknowledged that 'we certainly would agree that Ms. Moore had some knowledge that something happened,' and told a story about a meeting involving Shakespeare and a couple of guys at Moore's home.'The fact is that something happened,' said Hileman. 'Ms. Moore may have suspected something happened but she was not an eyewitness to details.'The trial is expected to last two weeks.","Prosecutors say Dorice 'Dee Dee' Moore befriended Abraham Shakespeare to get to his money .

A bullying laundry owner has been fined after issuing a string of threats against his staff such asburning them in acid, setting his dogs on them and taunting female workers about rape. Kevin Andrews, 61, was found guilty of a catalogue of abuse against former workers at Mallee Laundry and Linen Services in the town of Mildura, Australia. He was convicted by magistrates in Melbourne and fined $50,000 - worth around £30,000. Between 2007 and 2009 he had repeatedly bullied works physically, psychologically and verbally, the court heard. Magistrate Hugh Radford said on one occasion Andrews asked an employee to bring his dogs . to the laundry ‘and if an employee stuffed up they would be bitten by . the dogs – that is, the employee would be locked up with the dogs in a . shipping container.’ The magistrate added that Andrews had . ‘threatened the employees that he would dissolve them in acid, a . substance that was available to them in the workplace.’ Mr Radford said that on one occasion . Andrews told a female employee a rapist was waiting for her, following . a talk that a sex offender was in the area. ‘This was clearly designed to . frighten that particular employee,’ said the magistrate, who also . referred to a fines list under which workers could be docked a week’s . wages for ‘wasting time.’ ‘In my view,’ said the magistrate, . ‘this may have been laughed off by some employees, but it was clearly . designed by the accused to psychologically bully staff.’ Andrews called one woman a ‘big fat bush pig’ and said other women were brain dead and that ‘all women are dogs’.

Dyson has applied for a patent for a wash basin with taps that can not only spout water but also blow hot air to dry your hands. The innovative British company, already famous for its vacuum cleaners and Airblade hand driers, outlined the design in an application to the U.S. Patent Office. While some public toilets already include integrated systems where visitors can wash their hands and dry them in the same place, Dyson's innovation appears to be making both the water and the air come from one mechanism. All in one: Dyson has applied to patent a new device that would integrate taps with a hand drier, allowing people to wash their hands and dry them without moving away from the sink . In US patent application 2012/0291195, filed last week, the Malmesbury, Wiltshire-based company explains how the unit is operated by sensors which will release water from the underside of a spout. When users finish washing their hands a further pair of sensors recognise when they place each hand beneath a pair of ducts which then activate the drier to blow hot air to dry them off. The invention is an advance on the . traditional set up which forces toilet goers to wash at a sink, then . walk with dripping hands to a wall-mounted drier, where there may be a . queue. Sir James Dyson: The filing is likely to create a buzz since Dyson has since its inception been associated with clever and clean design and engineering . It doesn't move on far from the increasingly common washbasin with integrated drier set up. It is simply, as Dyson asserts in their patent application, their first dual purpose fixture that combines both functions. The filing is nevertheless likely to create a buzz since Dyson has since its inception by inventor James Dyson with his bagless vacuum cleaner been associated with clever and clean design and engineering. The filing, filed on May 17, proposes a 'dual-purpose fixture for a sink or wash basin, incorporating both a water tap and a hand dryer'. It says: 'The water tap has a spout arranged to project over the basin of the sink, and the hand dryer incorporates two or more hand-dryer nozzles—at least one for each of a user's hands. 'The left-hand nozzle is located on the left-hand side of the spout and the right-hand nozzle is located on the right-hand side of the spout, specifically so that the spout acts as a dividing partition between the two hand-dryer nozzles. 'This encourages correct usage of the hand-dryer. The fixture may be fitted to a sink or wall-mounted above the sink.'","Hands-free device is operated by sensors that both activate tap and drier .

Harassment: Ethel Watkins, 83, launched a shocking campaign against a young family after a child's football landed in her neighbouring garden . An 83-year-old woman launched a shocking harassment campaign against an Army sergeant major and his young family who lived next door after the children’s football landed in her garden, a court heard. Ethel Watkins breached her restraining order just one day after it was put in place, allegedly verbally abusing her neighbours as well as banging on the walls and setting off her own burglar alarm to deprive the children of sleep. Watkins is even said to have taunted the young mother about the loss of a six-month-old baby and allegedly said she hoped her husband ‘wouldn’t come back from Afghanistan’. The family, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were subjected to ‘some of the nastiest harassment’ that a police officer said he had seen in ten years on the force. Watkins originally admitted a charge of harassment in July this year and narrowly avoided prison because of her age, instead receiving a fine and five-year restraining order preventing her from contacting the family. But she was arrested again within 24 hours of her court appearance for allegedly resuming her campaign on the quiet street in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. Today she faced the Loughborough Magistrates’ Court accused of breaching the order on four separate occasions. The court heard the family, who now live in Cyprus where the Sgt Maj is based, moved in next to Watkins in 2011 because they wanted to make a ‘fresh start’ after the loss of their baby and initially got on well with their new neighbour. The mother even confided in Watkins, who lives alone, about the death of the child but the relationship turned sour after a ball the children were playing with landed in Watkins’ garden. The investigating officer in the . original case, Pc Chris Perry, of Melton Police, said at the time: ‘It . was some of the nastiest harassment I’ve seen in the 10 years I’ve been . doing the job. ‘It was used to totally try and mentally scar and control the victim and make her feel worse than she possibly could.’ Taunted young family: Just a day after a restraining order was put in place against her, Watkins allegedly continued her campaign, verbally abusing her neighbours as well as banging on the walls, setting off her burglar alarm to deprive the children of sleep and making rude gestures as she passed their house (left) Carol Huston, prosecuting, said the trouble then escalated rapidly, with Watkins setting off her own burglar alarm to prevent the children from sleeping. Watkins would regularly insult the mother with songs she had made up, the court heard. Mrs Huston said: ‘She would repeat over and over things like “You’re poison, an evil woman. Go back to where you come from, you witch”.’ Mrs Huston said that on September 3 Watkins was in her front garden when she started making vomiting noises when the neighbour came outside to take her sons to school. She added that on occasions, the taunts referred to the dead child. She said: ‘Watkins would shout words similar to, “What kind of life would the child have had if it lived?”’ The . family were asked by police to log every incident to build up a dossier . of evidence against Watkins. Pictures the family took included the . widow flashing a V sign as she passed their home. She . was eventually arrested and appeared in court on July 25 where she . admitted harassment and was given the restraining order. However, just a . day later Watkins allegedly committed her first breach. Giving . evidence via videolink from Cyrpus, the mother claimed she ‘couldn’t . believe it’ when Watkins allegedly renewed her campaign. She told how the children were playing in a paddling pool when Watkins began shouting over the fence. The . court heard she was singing about being ‘on top of the world’ because . she had avoided prison, and spoke loudly about how she hoped the soldier . wouldn’t return from Afghanistan ‘but probably would because he would . hide behind others’. The mother said: ‘She spoke about us being vultures and that we were in it for the money. ‘My heart was racing. I couldn’t believe what she was saying. ‘I can’t explain how it made us all feel. It was totally destructive. Quiet street campaign: The family moved into the street (house pictured far right) to make a 'fresh start' next to Watkins' house (centre) and initially got on well with her . ‘I know what she was trying to do to us. Her aim was to get us out of the house. She said that she managed to get the previous neighbours out. ‘I felt her aim was to get us out of the house. Why? I don’t know. Was it the children? I just don’t know. Unless you were involved in it, you can’t understand what we were going through.’ Watkins committed three further breaches of the restraining order in early September. She made retching noises at the family, called the mother ‘scum’ and insulted the children. The woman said: ‘I can’t explain what she’s done to us without getting upset. When it’s directed at you and your family and your security it’s totally destructive and it has been.’ The hearing was told that while the mother and her sons were in their garden, Watkins held a Dictaphone over the fence and said into the machine: ‘I just want everyone to hear the hooligans. I’ve never heard anything like it.’ Giving evidence from Cyprus, the Sgt Maj said the continuing harassment had prevented him returning to Afghanistan. He said: ‘I can’t protect my family if I am in Afghanistan. It is hard enough as it is over there just talking to your family by telephone. ‘It is hard to take knowing your family are being abused. ‘I’m a proud man. I’m proud of my job. I am 6’1” and a well-built soldier who has served his country in war zones all over the world. But here I was frustrated by a very old lady. ‘It felt like there was little I could do to protect my wife and children while I was away from home. ‘Peace and quiet was the reason we moved up there, and all I wanted was her to leave my family alone.’ Watkins denies breaching a restraining order. The trial, which was adjourned to December 18, continues.

Zoey stands to receive $108,000 annually over the next four years, $48,000 in the fifth year and then $52,000 each year until age 18. She'll continue to receive that amount until age 23 if she attends college. The beneficiary of Belcher, who was in his fourth season, also will receive $600,000 in life insurance, plus $200,000 for each credited season. Memorial: Pallbearers help load the body of Kansas City Chiefs' Jovan Belcher into a hearse . Moving on: Retired Chiefs Hall of Famer Bobby Bell said, 'It's done and over with and people need to get on with their lives.' There is also $100,000 in a retirement account that will go to his beneficiary or estate. Players' beneficiaries are kept confidential - the current collective bargaining agreement was ratified in August 2011. Belcher's mother Cheryl Shepherd, 54, has temporary custody of the couple's baby and relatives have said she will take responsibility for the infant. Family man: Belcher with his girlfriend at the birth of his son just months before he left the child orphaned . Gone: Belcher's baby will never know her mother . It is thought she will raise her granddaughter at the Long Island home where the 25-year-old grew up. Ms Shepherd had been in Kansas City to help Belcher and his girlfriend with their young daughter when the incident happened. The . couple had doted on their young daughter - they posted several photos . on the internet showing Perkins holding the infant when she was born as . well as photos of the trio. Tragic case: Belcher is pictured with his girlfriend and the mother of his child, Kasandra Perkins, whom he shot dead at his home on Saturday before killing himself . Love: On Facebook, a profile for Kasandra Perkins includes pictures of her and Belcher with their three month old baby . Meanwhile more details have been released about the hours leading up to the tragedy. Belcher was awoken by police officers at 2.50am as he slept outside an apartment block in his car. He told them that he was there to visit his 'girlfriend', yet she was not home, police spokesman Darin Snapp said. Snapp said Belcher made a phone call and a short time later, a woman let Belcher into her building. While . Snapp said police did not question the woman and don't know who she is, . the New York Post identified her as Brittni Glass, who works at an . Armani Exchange in Kansas City, . Witnesses have since told police that Belcher stayed at the apartment until 6:30 a.m., Snapp said. Murder: After leaving, he went home, shot his live-in girlfriend and then killed himself at his team's stadium . 'I was with him that night, that's it,' Glass told the Post. Glass said they had been together . that night but were not in a relationship and would not say where he . slept. Police confirmed that several people came forward to tell them . about Belcher's visit. Snapp . added: 'When he was sleeping she may have come home, and he didn't . realise. He was very cooperative and thanked the officers.' He went off their radar until about 7:50 a.m., when police were called to Belcher's home after he had shot and killed Perkins. Stepping out: Brittni Glass, who was out with Jovan Belcher the night before he killed his girlfriend before committing suicidie, is seen in Kansas City on Tuesday morning . 'Girlfriend': He was reportedly found sleeping in his car outside her home before going inside for four hours . Her body was found on the floor of the master bathroom with multiple gunshot wounds, according to a police incident report. Belcher's mother said she was not happy about the release Wednesday of recordings of the emergency phone call she made after Perkins was shot. 'I just got a phone call that they did that, and I don't appreciate it'  she said. 'Right now I don't want to talk about it.' In the  911 calls released by Kansas City police,  Shepherd begs Perkins to stay alive. 'Stay with me, the ambulance is on the way. Stay with me,' she shouts. She adds to the dispatcher: 'She's still breathing but please hurry. I don't know how he... They were arguing, please hurry.' Final night: Crews work on an apartment building in Kansas City, Missouri where Jovan Belcher spent some of his final hours outside the home of a woman whom he called his 'girlfriend' Away from home: Police said Belcher went inside around 2.30am and witnesses said he left at 6.30am . Shepherd told dispatchers that Perkins was bleeding, 'just barely' awake and that it looked as though she was wounded in the back. She said Perkins moved when she spoke to her. When police arrived at the couple's home at about 7:50 a.m., they found Perkins' body on the floor of the master bathroom with gunshot wounds to her chest, neck and abdomen. By this point Belcher had driven to his team’s stadium and shot himself dead in front of his coach and general manager. Crime scene: The Independence, Missouri, home where Belcher fatally shot his girlfriend on Saturday . On Wednesday, Shepherd said that the days since the shooting have been very difficult - but that she loves her son and the slain girlfriend. In a brief phone conversation, Shepherd, who had been staying with the couple to help out with the baby, said she had a 'beautiful relationship' with Perkins. She added that she has been working on funeral arrangements for Belcher but has not managed to sleep or eat much since the slayings. Mourners, including several Chiefs players, attended an hour-long private memorial service for Belcher on Wednesday in Kansas City. Retired Chiefs Hall of Famer Bobby Bell said afterward:  'This is a sad situation,' 'You never want to be put under those situations. Never. It's not good. You don't want to see things like that. I don't know how they got through it.' The funeral for Perkins is scheduled for this afternoon at the Ridgeview Family Fellowship Church in Blue Ridge, Texas, 50 miles northeast of Dallas . According to the Turrentine Jackson Morrow funeral home, she is also survived by two siblings, her parents, grandparents and a great-grandmother.","Jovan Belcher shot Kasandra Perkins his 22-year-old girlfriend before driving to Arrowhead stadium and turning the gun on himself .

A widow who found an old coin as she cleared out her late husband’s chest of drawers today sold it for nearly £300,000 at auction. The unidentified woman had no idea her husband had the valuable treasure stashed away among his clothes. It was only when an expert inspected it that it was revealed to be a ‘lost’ coin made from gold seized by the British from a Spanish treasure ship in 1702. Lying in a drawer for years: The 'Vigo' gold coins were only bought by 'seriously wealthy' people in 1703 . The unnamed pensioner, from Tunbridge Wells, was told the coin had an estimated value of up to £120,000, but today it was auctioned for more than double that following a tense stand-off between two telephone bidders. The coin is extremely rare as only 20 were made from 7.5lbs of gold seized from Spanish treasure ships by the British in Vigo Bay, northern Spain, in 1702. Even in 1703, when they were made by the Royal Mint, they would have been extremely expensive and bought only by the rich. The whereabouts of fewer than 15 of the coins are currently known about, and they are in private hands. The coin that was sold today is thought to have been inherited, rather than bought, by the woman's late husband, as he showed no interest in coin-collecting when he was alive. Leslie Gillham, of auctioneers Gorringes, said: 'A client of ours asked to bring in some coins that she had found at home. 'I wasn’t really excited at the time because most coins we came across are worth very little. Flip-side: The five-guinea piece bears the date 1703 and four shields with the arms of England, Scotland, Ireland and France on one side. On the other side is the bust of Queen Anne . 'She produced from her handbag one or two old silver coins worth a few pounds. I flippantly said ""It's a pity you haven’t got any gold ones"" and she said that she had. 'With that she produced this 1703 five guinea piece. She said she had found it in her late husband’s chest of drawers and he died some years ago. 'She knew nothing about it at all and neither did her grown-up children. I thought that it must have been a fake. She left it with me to do some more research on. 'I sought a second opinion which confirmed it was genuine and I went and saw her to give her the good news. 'She was very cool over it. 'Her husband was a professional man and beyond that we have no idea how he came by it. He must have inherited it.' The series of 'Vigo' coins were made out of treasure captured by the British fleet after they failed to take Cadiz in 1702 but managed to seize gold and silver from Franco-Spanish treasure ships coming back from America. The coins were made as part of an attempt to detract attention from the British failure at Cadiz, highlighting instead the haul of treasure they seized on their way home. Mr Gillham said: 'The treasure was received at the Royal Mint by the Master of the Mint, Sir Isaac Newton. 'It was decided that the treasure had to be coined as part of a propaganda opportunity. 'About 20 of the Queen Anne Vigo five guinea coins were struck and they would have been bought by seriously wealthy people at the time and kept as part of the family treasure. 'This coin is in an extremely fine condition. It is very rare and is one of the most desirable gold coins around.' The coin sold at Gorringes in Tunbridge Wells for a hammer price of £240,000, and with buyer’s premium and VAT added on, the total amount was £296,160. A set of four 14th century paintings which have hung on the wall of a village church for 150 years have fetched almost £1million at auction. The paintings depicting Christ were found to be by Italian artists Niccolo di Pietro Gerini after cleaning work was carried out on them in the 1990s. They had previously been hung at St Michael and All Angels' Church in Withyham, East Sussex, after they were donated by Edward John Ottley in the 1840s. After their true value was discovered it was decided not to return them to the church due to security issues and conditions so the artworks - dating back to about 1390 - were transferred on loan to Leeds Castle in Maidstone, Kent. They were sold yesterday at Sotheby's in London for £950,000.

George Osborne targeted workers at the top, middle and bottom of the financial heap yesterday with a raft of money-saving measures. He ordered a tax raid on higher earners’ pensions, warning that Britain is only a third of the way through its age of austerity. He dragged 400,000 more workers into the 40p tax rate by raising the earnings threshold by just one per cent – below the rate of inflation. Scroll down for video . Smiles: Mr Osborne, grinning yesterday, targeted workers at the top, middle and bottom of the financial heap with a raft of money-saving measures . Autumn Statement: Mr Osborne admitted higher government borrowing and lower-than-expected economic growth meant spending cuts and tax rises designed to balance the books would have to be extended by an extra year, to 2018 . And the canny Chancellor dared Labour to oppose real-terms cuts in welfare payments to millions of unemployed and lower-income families for the next three years, declaring himself on the side of those ‘who want to work hard and get on’. In his Autumn Statement, Mr Osborne admitted higher government borrowing and lower-than-expected economic growth meant spending cuts and tax rises designed to balance the books would have to be extended by an extra year, to 2018. Official figures showed that the hardest hit by his measures will be the top ten per cent and bottom ten per cent of earners. But today Mr Osborne defended the move to increase the number of people earning just over £41,000 who will end up paying the 40p tax rate. 'I would not describe those people as wealthy. They’re better off than many of their citizens but they’re certainly not wealthy,' he told BBC News. 'What I’ve tried to do, in a very difficult situation where I’m trying to control government spending, is make sure it is done fairly across all incomes.' David Cameron, on a visit to east London this morning, also defended the need for more cuts: We've had to take very difficult decisions and I don't hide that for a minute. 'What this Autumn Statement and what this government is all about is being on the side of people who work hard and want to get on.' David Cameron, who today addressed the Electric City Conference in east London, insisted the government is 'on the side of people who work hard and want to get on' Mr Cameron today met Daniel Hirshmann, co-founder and director of electronics company Technology Will Save Us to highlight government support for entrepreneurs . The Prime Minister added: 'By lifting the personal allowance, the amount of money you can earn before you pay any income tax, it is very close now to our goal of £10,000. 'It is hugely helpful to all working people. It means for instance someone on the minimum wage but who works full-time, working hard, we have halved their income tax under this government. 'Clearly by cancelling the 3p increase in fuel duty we're helping again people who have to use their cars to get to work. So we're on the side of those who work hard.' In a boost for Middle Britain, the Chancellor announced a surprise increase in the personal income tax allowance, meaning the first £9,440 earned will be tax free. Mr Osborne won his loudest cheers as he told MPs he was scrapping a 3p increase in fuel duty pencilled in for January. But official figures show that as a result of all the tax, benefit and public spending changes implemented by the Coalition since 2010, the average household will be around £1,140 worse off by 2015, with the top fifth of households £2,370 worse off. In other key moves, corporation tax was cut by an extra penny to 21p by 2014, compared with 28p when the Coalition came to power, and small businesses were given investment tax breaks. From 2014, lifetime pension relief allowance will fall from £1.5million to £1.25million and annual allowance will be cut from £50,000 to £40,000. The point at which debt is predicted to begin falling was delayed by a year to 2016. Estimates for public-sector job losses were increased to 1.1million, though twice as many jobs will be created in the private sector. Heads will be given discretion over teachers’ pay in a move which infuriated trade unions. Basic state pension will rise by 2.5 per cent next year to £110.15 a week. The Chancellor said that as a result of his plans, government spending as share of national income would fall from 48 per cent in 2009/10 under Labour to 39.5 per cent in 2017/18. But he was forced to concede that there is ‘much more to do’ to restore the public finances to health against a backdrop of gloomy economic data. Mr Osborne conceded the budget deficit was ‘still far too high for comfort’, though he wrongfooted Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls by announcing that having already been cut by 25 per cent, the deficit will unexpectedly fall again this year – thanks in part to a £3.5billion windfall from the sale of the 4G mobile phone spectrum. He used a fresh round of spending cuts from day-to-day Whitehall budgets to pay for investment in projects designed to stimulate the economy. There will be a £5billion investment programme in new roads, 100 new free schools and academies, science laboratories, ultra-fast broadband and further education colleges. ‘We cannot relax our efforts to make our economy safe,’ the Chancellor told MPs. ‘But Britain is heading in the right direction. The road is hard but we’re making progress. It’s taking time, but the British economy is healing. ‘As well as a tax system where the . richest pay their fair share, we have to have a welfare system that is . fair to the working people who pay for it.’ Mr . Osborne announced that he is to change the law to break a link between . inflation and the ballooning welfare bill, with out-of-work benefits . rising by just one per cent for the next three years. Under previous . rules, benefits were increased every April by the inflation rate in the . previous September, which this year was 2.2 per cent. Mr Osborne said . that as a result, the incomes of those on out-of-work benefits has . soared by 20 per cent since 2007, twice the rate of a worker on average . earnings. Labour insisted . that 60 per cent of those affected by the real-terms welfare cuts, . however, were in work – because working tax credits, child tax credits, . local housing allowance, maternity allowance and statutory maternity pay . will also be affected. Statement: George Osborne said the move would return 'fairness' to the benefits system . All smiles: The Chancellor, seen with Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander and David Cameron, is forcing the Opposition into a corner over whether to oppose the cap . The Chancellor said a new round of tax rises and spending cuts was necessary because the eurozone crisis had hit the economy and the recession was worse than previously thought – with almost seven per cent of national income lost in 2008 and 2009. Quoting the latest forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, he said the economy was now expected to shrink by 0.1 per cent this year compared with a previous prediction of 0.8 per cent growth. He admitted he was on course to miss his target that debt should start falling as a proportion of GDP by 2015/16 – the year of the next election. Instead he said it would take another year. Mr Balls, pictured, said the Autumn Statement illustrated the ¿true scale of this Government¿s economic failure¿ . Announcing the cut in corporation tax to 21 per cent, compared with 40 in the US, 33 in France and 29 in Germany, the Chancellor said: ‘This is the lowest rate of any major western economy. Britain is open for business.’ Mr Balls said the Autumn Statement illustrated the ‘true scale of this Government’s economic failure’. He added: ‘The Chancellor’s fiscal strategy has been completely derailed. The defined purpose of the Government, the cornerstone of the Coalition, the one test they set themselves – to balance the books and get the debt falling by 2015 – is now in tatters.’ Labour would not say whether it intended to vote against legislation limiting benefit increases and  a move to cap overall benefit payments, saying it would study the detail.","Mr Osborne targeted workers at top, middle and bottom of financial heap .

A £1billion raid on pensions will hit tens of thousands of middle and high-income earners, experts warned last night. George Osborne yesterday announced he was cutting the tax-free amount an individual can put into their pension each year from £50,000 to £40,000. It comes just a year after the annual limit was cut from £255,000. Autumn statement: Chancellor George Osborne delivers his Autumn budget in the Commons and cut the tax relief for rich pensioners . The tax-free cap on lifetime pension . pots will also be reduced from £1.5million to £1.25million. The . Chancellor suggested the changes would largely affect only those at the . very top of the income scale. But experts warned that many middle income earners could be affected if they are in final salary pension schemes. However the main impact will be on those earning higher incomes, particularly in the public sector. Sources suggested the change could . affect the top five per cent of public sector earners – including senior . civil servants, top doctors, leading police officers and head teachers. Off to work: George Osborne and Danny Alexander leave the Chancellor's home on Autumn Statement day - and are set to hit Britain's richest . The Treasury said 160,000 a year . would be caught by the decision to cap annual tax relief at £40,000. Some 340,000 workers will be affected by the lifetime allowance to £1.25 . million. The pensions raid was drawn up as an alternative to the Lib . Dems’ mansion tax on homes worth more than £2million. Mr Osborne said: ‘I know these tax . measures will not be welcomed by all – ways to reduce the deficit never . are. But we must show we’re all in this together.’ Joanne Segars, chief executive of the . National Association of Pension Funds, said many on middle incomes . could be hit with tax bills running into thousands of pounds if they got . a significant promotion. She added: ‘The Chancellor is wrong to say that the changes will only affect those at the top of the wage tree. Complaint: George Osborne and Danny Alexander leave the Treasury building on Whitehall yesterday but their decision to cut tax benefits for pensions have been panned by some . ‘Osborne claims he is taking a carrot . away from the rich, but he is also beating many middle class savers . with a stick. Middle managers in the public and private sectors will get . caught in the net. ‘People in a final salary pension who . have worked loyally for the same employer for years and then get a pay . rise, or a promotion, could end up with a tax bill of several thousand . pounds.’ The self-employed and those nearing . retirement desperately trying to ‘catch up’ by boosting their pension . are also at risk. ‘What we desperately need is stability, so that people . can trust the pensions system and get on with saving for their old age, . instead of being treated like a cashpoint when things go wrong,’ she . said. Doing the maths: George Osborne on his visit to HM Revenue & Customs ahead of his mini-budget . But Ros Altmann, director-general of . Saga, said it was reasonable to trim the pension tax allowances of the . better-off. ‘It is understandable that the Chancellor has chosen to . limit the amount spent on top earners’ pensions tax relief,’ she said. ‘Tax relief is meant to be an . incentive to help people save for retirement, but it is hugely expensive . and it provides the most incentive to the people who need it least. The . highest earners get the highest incentives.’ Mr Osborne said the . average pension saver put in £6,000 a year, with just one per cent . putting away more than £40,000. An individual saving for a defined . contribution scheme in the private sector would have to be earning well . over £200,000 to be affected. Successful small business owners, workers with generous final salary schemes and the very wealthiest will be hit by the raid on pensions. They will either be caught out by a lower cap on how much tax relief they can get on their pension contributions, or by a limit on the amount they can save up in a retirement fund. Yesterday, George Osborne announced the annual tax allowance for pension contributions will be cut from £50,000 to £40,000 from 2014. The lifetime limit will be lowered from £1.5million to £1.25million. For the vast majority, paying these sorts of sums into a pension pot is unimaginable. A 30-year-old, getting healthy annual pay rises and benefiting from a good return on his or her investment, would have to pay in 40p of every £1 earned every year for 35 years to get close to the £1.25million limit, according to  insurers Standard Life. Even someone in a very generous final salary scheme, with 40 years’ continuous service, who retired on £97,500 a year, would only just bust the cap. The Government estimates that just 30,000 people would have more than £1.25million in their pension pots in 2014. But around 330,000 of current working age could be affected in the future. These are all likely to be senior staff in companies or the public sector, with good final salary schemes to which they have contributed for years. It is the annual allowance which will catch out more workers. Typically, small business owners don’t pay into a pension during their working years, instead preferring to make a large lump sum when they sell their company. Head teachers, police chiefs, senior nurses, middle-ranking civil servants and private sector managers on around £50,000, who are in final salary schemes and get a 10 per cent pay rise could also bust the cap and face a tax charge on the excess. The raid on pensions may be morally acceptable but the Chancellor must, once and for all, make up his mind how he wants to treat tax relief on pensions so workers know what to expect in retirement. The message that this Government keeps reinforcing is that savers’ nest eggs are fair game when it comes to getting the economy back on track.

Turkish MPs may ban a hugely popular soap opera after it depicted a venetrated Sultan from the Middle Ages as a hard-drinking womaniser. Magnificent Century, which attracts 150m viewers an episode, was branded 'twisted' by politicians in the conservative Muslim country over its depiction of Suleiman I, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. The Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticised the show last month, and a draft law has now been proposed that could see disrespectful historical TV and film adaptions banned. Mobs of protesters deface a Magnificent Century billboard in Istanbul in protest at its sexy scenes . He condemned the show 'before the nation' - and his sentiments were echoed by MP Oktay Saral, who has proposed the new bill. Mr Saral said the show 'Imposed on Suleiman the Magnificent, a person who spent his life on horseback serving his country and his nation, is a life entirely composed of the bedroom and based on twisted relationships.' Magnificent Century attracts around a third of all television viewers during its prime time slot every Wednesday and is even shown in countries as far flung as Hungary and Japan. But it has riled Turkish hardliners over scenes showing Suleiman I hitting the bottle and cavorting with the women in his harem. The Sultan, nicknamed the Magnificent in the West and the Lawgiver in the East was at the helm of the Ottoman Empire during its glory days in the mid-16th Century. The show takes a melodramatic look at the life of 16th century Ottoman Sultan Suleiman I . He went against social conventions at the time by marrying a Ukrainian woman from his harem. The bid to ban Magnificent Century and similar shows comes amid growing accusations that the PM is meddling in social issues. He has already shocked voters this year by proposing to reinstate the death penalty and ban abortion. Mr Erdogan has also announced controversial plans to build a huge new mosque on Istanbul's largest hill. His critics claim the eye-catching proposals are an attempt to distract voters from wider issues, including the government's handling of the crisis in Syria and growing unrest among Turkish Kurds. And one of the show's former stars has condemned the proposals, claiming the PM wanted to 'change the agenda.' Nebahat Cehre, who played the Sultan's mother in the first two series of the show added: 'I can't think of any other reason to discuss an imaginary television series when there are so many problems in a country.'","Magnificent Century branded 'twisted' by Turkish MPs .

But the homeless man says he cannot even wear his new shoes for fear they could be stolen - or even get him killed by an envious fellow beggar. And his sudden celebrity has apparently done little to improve his prospects, as he continues to panhandle on the streets of New York and complains, 'I want a piece of the pie' from the touching photograph. Scroll down for video . Popular: This photograph of NYPD officer Lawrence DePrimo giving a new pair of shoes to beggar Jeffrey Hillman has spread around the world in the past few days . The New York Times tracked down Hillman, who is again shoeless, despite the good deed . Mr Hillman's fame stems from an image of NYPD officer Lawrence DePrimo handing him a new pair of $100 boots after finding him sitting barefoot and desolate on the street in Times Square. The photograph was featured on numerous news sites, and captured the hearts of millions as a symbol of unfeigned generosity and a public servant going beyond the call of duty. But when the New York Times tracked down the recipient yesterday, he claimed he had not benefited from his newfound recognition. The Times revealed that Mr Hillman is a 54-year-old veteran who has lived on the streets of Manhattan for the best part of a decade. Hero: Mr DePrimo has gained instant fame for his selfless act, but insists he was just doing his duty . Gift: But Mr Hillman says he cannot wear his new $100 boots for fear he will be robbed or even killed over them . He grew up in South Plainfield, New Jersey, and after high school he signed up to the Army in 1978. After being honorably discharged from the military, he worked in catering in his home state - and he says he does not know how he ended up homeless. He told the paper he remembered his meeting with Mr DePrimo and said he was grateful for the officer's gift, adding: 'I wish there were more people like him in the world.' But during his interview with the Times he was once again barefoot, saying: 'Those shoes are hidden. They are worth a lot of money. I could lose my life.' Family: Mr Hillman's brother Kirk and sister-in-law Tish say they hear from him around once a year . Mr Hillman also suggested that he should gain financially from the furore surrounding the viral image: 'I was put on YouTube, I was put on everything without permission. What do I get?' He added, 'This went around the world, and I want a piece of the pie.' However, he also took the time to thank those who had taken an interest in him, saying, 'It meant a lot to me.' Earlier it was revealed that his family had no idea he was living on the streets, as his sister-in-law Tish said she and her husband heard from him only around once a year. The panhandler also two children, 24-year-old Jeffrey Jr and Nikita, 22, but he is no longer in regular contact with them.","Homeless man who received NYPD gift revealed as Jeffrey Hillman, a 54-year-old Army veteran from New Jersey .

When this devastated dog owner left her tiny teacup Chihuahua paralysed after accidentally rolling on top of it in bed, she feared her beloved family pet would never recover. The dog, named Mary, was rendered immobile after a bone in its neck snapped, and vets told owner Lisa Havelock that the pint-sized pooch would have to be put down. But the Chihuahua has now been dubbed 'Miracle Mary' after making a remarkable recovery - and devout Christian Ms Havelock has said it is all thanks to the power of prayer. The miracle of Mary: Lisa Havelock feared her tiny teacup Chihuahua would not recover after she accidentally rolled on it in bed, rendering the dog immobile . Injury: Devout Ms Havelock said Mary, whose neck injury is visible in this X-ray, made a miraculous recovery after she and her friends prayed that she would get better . Ms Havelock had brought Mary home as a pet for her children Willow, 15, and Oakley, but said the whole family had fallen in love with the 'diamond' dog. She accidentally crushed the pet when she rolled over onto it at her home in Barmouth, Gwynned, in north west Wales. After rushing Mary to the local vet, Ms Havelock was told it was unlikely the dog would pull through and that it would have to be put down. Horrified at the prospect of losing Mary, devout Ms Havelock gathered 15 others to pray for her dog's recovery at her local Elim Pentecostal Church. Incredibly, Mary rallied around, and Ms Havelock firmly believes she got the miracle she prayed for. 'When we took her to the vets they thought she would have to be put down,' she said. 'The vets told us that her quality of life would be no good. 'We were absolutely devastated, and I felt awful because it was me who had done this to her. 'We got Mary for our children Oakley, who’s seven, and Willow who’s 15, but we all fell in love with her because she’s such a diamond.' Relief: Mary the Chihuahua with owner Lisa Havelock and her son Oakley, seven, who feared their beloved pet would have to be put down . Close-up: The tiny dog lost the use of all four of its legs when its neck was broken . Ms Havelock, who said the whole . family cried as she told her children that Mary might not pull through, . turned to prayer the following day. 'We've now called her Miracle Mary' Owner Lisa Havelock . 'The next day around 15 of us got together and went to Elim Pentecostal church and we prayed for a miracle for Mary,' she said. Now, following surgery and two weeks of intensive veterinary care, the Chihuahua is back at home with the Havelocks. The dog's owner added that the day before Mary . came home, vets at Tudor Lawson Dallimore and Parry vets in Dolgellau, . Gwynedd, north-west Wales, had said that she would only have 30 per cent . quality of life. 'She needed to be able to have 85 per cent quality of life before she could come home,' Ms Havelock said. 'We were dreading the phone call to say that we would have to have her put down and when the phone rang I just felt sick. 'But the vets told us that Mary was better and she would be allowed home, it was just amazing, it has got to be a miracle. 'We do believe in the power of prayer, that little dog was not supposed to live but she did. 'We’ve now called her Miracle Mary,' Ms Havelock said of her cherished pet, who spent six weeks wearing a tiny neck brace after returning home to Gwynedd. On the mend: Mary, seen with her owner and vet Alice Hewitt, is now walking around again following two and a half weeks of intensive veterinary care . A spokesperson for the vet in Gwynedd said: 'Mary’s neck injury was very severe and she had lost the use of all of her legs. 'We weren’t sure if she was going to pull through when she first arrived at the surgery. 'After two and a half weeks of intensive veterinary care from our team and complete immobilisation of her head and neck, Mary was showing signs of improvement and was beginning to move her legs on her own. 'Therefore we decided that she was progressing well enough for her to continue her recovery at home with the care of her dedicated owners.' The tiny dog now has something of a fan club at the veterinary surgery. 'Mary is such a huge character despite her tiny size,' the spokesman said. 'We are all thrilled with the extent of her recovery and are confident she will only get stronger as time goes on.'","Tiny teacup Chihuahua Mary's neck was broken when its owner Lisa Havelock accidentally rolled on top of her pet in bed .

Tragic: Casey Schulman, 22, died when her dive boat backed over her off a Caribbean island . A University of Virginia student has been killed by a boat propeller while snorkeling off a Caribbean island for a 'Semester at Sea' program. Casey Schulman, 22, died on Saturday on the tiny island nation of Dominica when the boat she and other students had hired backed over her. Police Inspector Richmond Valentine said she was killed on Saturday afternoon as she and more than 50 other students visited Dominica as part of the university's 'Semester at Sea' program. In a statement released to students and faculty, Patricia Lampkin, University of Virginia vice president and chief student affairs officer, said Schulman's death occurred during a recreational boating trip organized independently of Semester at Sea activities. Valentine said a group of students, including Schulman, hired a boat owned by local company Anchorage Dive. After a snorkeling excursion, the boat went to the west coast community of Mero where some students stayed in the water and others relaxed on the beach. Schulman was swimming when she was struck by the boat's propeller as the captain was apparently driving in reverse after picking up food, Valentine said. She sustained injuries over her entire body. Tragedy: Schulman, left, who is from an upscale suburb of Washington, DC, had hired a private dive boat along with other Semester at Sea students . Doctors pronounced her dead at a local hospital.

The founder of Wikipedia has urged the Government to block America's extradition of a British student on copyright charges in another attack on the 'dangerous' treaty between the two countries. Jimmy Wales, 45, has spoken out in support of Richard O’Dwyer, 24, who faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of charges relating to his website, TVShack.net, which linked to other sites that streamed pirated television programmes. Mr Wales, who has met Mr O’Dwyer, today called on Home Secretary Theresa May . to stop the extradition, which was approved by a district judge in . January, calling the student 'the human . face of the battle between the content industry and the interests of the . general public.' 'O’Dwyer is not a U.S. citizen, he’s lived in the UK all his life, his . site was not hosted there, and most of his users were not from the U.S.,' Mr Wales wrote in the Guardian. Outspoken: Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, right, says the Government should stop the extradition of student Richard O’Dwyer, left, claiming he is unfairly caught up in a censorship battle . 'The internet as a whole must not tolerate censorship in response to . mere allegations of copyright infringement. As citizens we must stand up . for our rights online. 'Given the thin case against him, . it is an outrage that he is being extradited to the US to face felony . charges for something that he is not being prosecuted for here. No US . citizen has ever been brought to the UK for alleged criminal activity . that took place on US soil.' Britain's extradition treaty with the US has already been branded ‘unbalanced’ by MPs who have  called for it to be urgently reformed. The Government is under huge pressure to renegotiate the Act and the Mail has also launched its Affront to British Justice . campaign in support of Asperger’s sufferer Gary McKinnon, who hacked into U.S. military computers from the bedroom of his North London flat. Support: Gary McKinnon, pictured, is also facing extradition to the U.S. on computer hacking charges . Mr Wales' plea is yet another call for it to be changed, with O’Dwyer’s supporters arguing that as the site did not host material . itself he should not face any charges and should therefore not be . extradited. Mr Wales, in a petition on the Change.org website, said TV Shack was 'similar to a search engine'. 'When I met . Richard (along with his mother), he struck me as a clean-cut, geeky kid. Still a university student, he is precisely the kind of person one can . imagine launching the next big thing on the internet,' he said today. 'Enthusiastic, with a sharp mind and a quick wit, he reminds me of many . great entrepreneurs. He tried to follow the law, and I would argue that . he very likely succeeded in doing so.' Mr Wales argued that Mr O’Dwyer, from Bolsover in Derbyshire but . studying in Sheffield, always did his best to play by the rules, saying . that on the few occasions he received requests to remove content from . copyright holders, he complied. 'Copyright is an important institution, serving a beneficial moral and economic purpose,'  he wrote. 'But that does not mean that copyright can or should be unlimited. 'It does not mean that we should abandon time-honoured moral and legal . principles to allow endless encroachments on our civil liberties in the . interests of the moguls of Hollywood.' It is the latest move by Mr Wales into a political arena. Earlier this year Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit, blacked out the English language version of its website in protest at anti-piracy laws being considered by the US government. Supporters include the film and music industry, which often sees its products sold illegally. They say the legislation is needed to protect intellectual property and jobs. Track record: In January Mr Wales shut down Wikipedia in a 'blackout' he said was a protest against US copyright laws . Julia O’Dwyer, Richard’s mother, said Mr Wales’s intervention was a huge boost to their campaign. 'It is obviously quite significant to have Jimmy Wales’s support,” she said. 'He didn’t do that lightly. He spent a lot of time talking to Richard. 'It has concentrated efforts to get the message across to the Government, because it is in their hands.' She said Mr O’Dwyer was due to have an appeal heard at the High Court in October or November this year. Mr O’Dwyer is one of several high-profile cases of Britons being extradited to the US under a treaty signed in 2003, which critics say is unfairly biased against British citizens. He told The Guardian that he was coping 'quite well' with the threat of extradition. 'It does get in the way, it distracts you... if you thought about extradition all day you’d never get any work done. It’d be a horrible mess,' he said. 'It’s quite difficult but I think I’m managing quite well. 'I think about it sometimes during the day, but I try to think about other things that are more important. I don’t let their extradition warrant ruin my life. 'Otherwise you’d fail university, just sit in your room all day moaning. They’d be winning if I let it do that.' A Home Office spokesman said today: 'We have effective, fair and balanced extradition arrangements with the US and other international partners. 'People who have committed serious offences such as murder, rape, other sex crimes and fraud, have been successfully extradited to the UK and convicted. 'It should also be noted that our courts have refused to extradite nine people requested by the US since 2004, while US courts have not refused any of our extradition requests.” Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, said: 'It is very significant that a giant of the internet has joined the campaign against Britain’s dangerously unfair extradition laws. 'The world-wide nature of the web leaves people incredibly vulnerable to being dragged across the world to face trial when they never left their bedrooms, let alone their country. 'We need far more safeguards and judicial discretion if a great deal of injustice and suffering is to be prevented.'","'It is an outrage that he is being extradited to the U.S. to face felony .

A British university student facing trial and imprisonment in America for breaking anti-piracy laws has won his fight against extradition. In a deal which is believed to be a legal first, Richard O’Dwyer, 24, will instead travel to the US voluntarily and pay a small sum in compensation. Supporters have hailed the decision, which follows a campaign led by his mother, Julia. Student Richard O'Dwyer with his mother Julia after hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court in January he would be extradited to the United States. That decision has now been overturned . The paediatric nurse, who lives near . Chesterfield, fought on behalf of her son, who had run the TVShack . website from his halls of residence at Sheffield Hallam University. The US authorities claimed TVShack . hosted links to pirated films and TV programmes and earned more than . £147,000 in advertising revenue. Prosecutors demanded Mr O’Dwyer should . be sent to the States under the controversial 2003 Extradition Act and . Home Secretary Theresa May signed a warrant for his extradition at the . start of the year. But after negotiations by Mr O’Dwyer’s legal team, he . has signed a ‘deferred prosecution’ agreement. The Daily Mail lead the fight against Gary McKinnon's extradition to the U.S. where he has been wanted to answer charges of hacking since 2002. Mr McKinnon (above) admits accessing U.S. government computers but claims he was looking for evidence of UFOs.Mr McKinnon, from Wood Green, London, has been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism, and faced 60 years in jail if convicted in the U.S. Bail conditions, imposed since 2005, meant he was banned from  using a computer and accessing the internet.On . October 16 this year Home Secretary Theresa May told MPs there was no . doubt Mr McKinnon was 'seriously ill' and the extradition warrant . against him should be withdrawn. At the High Court yesterday a judge . was told that Mr O’Dwyer was expected to complete the agreement in the . next 14 days, pay a small sum in compensation and give undertakings not . to infringe copyright laws again. His extradition application is then . expected to return to the High Court so it can formally be disposed of. Judge Sir John Thomas, president of the Queen’s Bench Division, said: . ‘It would be very nice for everyone if this was resolved happily before . Christmas.’ Sir John also said it was a ‘very satisfactory outcome’. Campaigners drew comparisons between . the case of Mr O’Dwyer and Gary McKinnon, the computer hacker saved from . extradition last month after a long Daily Mail campaign. Like Mr O’Dwyer, Gary’s supposed . crimes – hacking into military computers, while looking for evidence of . ‘little green men’ – took place from the UK. Mrs May has promised to introduce a . test to establish whether a person involved in similar cases should be . tried in the UK or US. Tory MP Dominic Raab, who campaigned . for reform of extradition laws, said: ‘This is a victory for Richard and . his family, a victory for British justice, and a victory for common . sense. We shouldn’t be subjecting British citizens to rough justice . under our blunt extradition regime.’ The court heard that O’Dwyer is expected . to travel to the U.S. in the next 14 days to complete the agreement. O’Dwyer was facing the prospect of being the first British citizen to be . extradited for such an alleged copyright offence and his lawyers argued . he would effectively become a 'guinea pig' for copyright law in the U.S. His . mother Julia O’Dwyer, from Chesterfield, said she was 'disgusted' when . she heard of the U.S. attempt to extradite her son and claimed the UK’s . extradition treaty with the U.S. 'needs fixing fast'. Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales (right) fought against O'Dwyer's extradition, saying he was unfairly caught up in a censorship battle . The US authorities alleged that O’Dwyer received more than 230,000 US dollars (around £147,000) in advertising revenue since January 2008, until the site was shut down in 2010. When he was arrested by City of London Police in November 2010, he accepted that he was earning approximately £15,000 per month from online advertisements. Human rights campaign group Liberty welcomed the proposed settlement of 24-year-old O'Dwyer's case but warned there was still need for reform of extradition laws. Isabella Sankey, Liberty's director of policy, said: 'This will be a huge relief for Richard - but how appalling that he had to wait so long for the US authorities to make this decision. 'Case after case shows that our extradition arrangements must be overhauled to allow people who have never left these shores to be dealt with here at home. We need urgent legislation to prevent their torment.' O'Dwyer, pictured here outside court in January, is expected to travel to the US in the next 14 days to complete an agreement to pay a small sum in compensation and give undertakings not to infringe copyright laws again .","Richard O'Dwyer was earning £15,000 a month from advertising on his website at the time of his arrest .

Helen Gough, 47, claimed the cash over a 10-year period, most of which she spent living in an affluent country hamlet, raising thoroughbred Arabian horses . A horse breeder who lived in a 20-room mansion has been jailed for two years after claiming £104,000 in benefits. Helen Gough, 47, claimed the cash over a 10-year period, most of which she spent living in an affluent country hamlet, raising thoroughbred Arabian horses, exporting some to Germany and making trips to the Middle East. She also bred dogs and Burmese cats and families in the hamlet where Gough lived said she was seen driving a Land Rover Discovery and a BMW convertible. But for the entire decade she was . claiming income support, housing benefit and help to pay her council . tax, Derby Crown Court heard. Gough . denied she was breeding animals as a business and said it was her . hobby, which was accepted by Department of Work and Pensions . investigators. Jailing her . Judge Andrew Hamilton said it was the worst case of benefit fraud he had . ever seen: 'It is the most disgraceful case of its kind,' he said. 'Many . people who stand in that dock are bad at managing finances or desperate . for money. For you it was entirely based on greed and determination to . fund your hobby.' He said he . had never before heard of anyone claiming benefits to enable them to . breed Arab horses.'Most people in Derby would count watching football as . their hobby,' he said. The court heard Gough had 'finance and . capital' herself, before meeting an 'affluent businessman' and moving . into his substantial property with acres of land' in Wheatcroft, near . Matlock, Derbyshire. Rhona . Campbell, prosecuting, said Gough lived a life of 'luxury and . indulgence' while claiming the benefits.Ms Campbell said: 'Few could . contemplate being able to afford this hobby of breeding horses and . whippets. 'I say hobby as she does not accept this was a business.' Gough lived in picturesque Wheatcroft, near Matlock, Derbyshire, where she bred animals for a hobby (her home is not pictured) Gough offered horses for sale on the website Acorn Arabians. The Arab Horse Society confirmed that the horses owned and bred by Gough were registered with them . She said investigators had calculated . that from 2003, when she moved into 20-room Wheatcroft House in the . village, she must have spent £44,000 on the hobby. 'This gives some indication of spare money in the household at a time when she was claiming benefit,' added Ms Campbell. Investigators . estimated she had been wrongly claiming benefits from 2000 until 2010. In 2000, she sold a house for just short of £80,000 even though she told . the authorities she was living in a rented property. Judge Andrew Hamilton called the case 'disgraceful' People living in the hamlet said it was well known that Gough was breeding exclusive Arabian horses, known for their speed, refinement, and endurance. The court was told she also bred whippets and Burmese cats. She offered them for sale on websites with the names 'Acorn Arabians' and 'Acornlodge'. Evidence was obtained from the Arab Horse Society confirming that the horses owned and bred by Gough were registered with them. Additionally, the Kennel Club confirmed that Gough had registered 162 whippets with them. Gough, now of Coton-in-the Clay, Staffordshire, initially denied the allegations but just before her trial admitted four counts of benefit fraud, which amounted to more than £104,299. Philip Bown, defending, told the court there was another side to Gough. He said she had shown 'determination and steadfastness' in spending 20 years caring for her severely disabled daughter, who suffered a rare form of cerebral palsy. The judge said he had taken her daughter into account when deciding on the sentence.But he said the fact she had tried to bring her into the court room showed what a 'manipulative woman' she was exploiting her daughter’s condition to get sympathy from the court. One resident from Wheatcroft said she had not known about the benefit fraud.But the woman, who did not wane to be named added: 'It doesn’t surprise me.' She said that when Gough had moved into the property to live with her partner, a very large barn had been built to house 20 or more horses, which had caused some problems with villagers.","Prosecutor says Helen Gough, 47, spent £44,000 on breeding animals .

But their application for residence was rejected because Mr Crystal's tumour means he can no longer work. Controversial: A British family are facing deportation from New Zealand because the father has a brain tumour, it has emerged. Sarah and Paul Crystal with their children Vincent, Claire and Max at their home in Onewhero, Auckland . According to the New Zealand Herald,  Bruce Burrows, from Immigration New Zealand, said the . family's application for residence was rejected because Mr Crystal was . 'likely to impose significant cost or demands on New Zealand's health . services'. Because the family - who have been left financially ruined because of Mr Crystal's illness - do not have a permanent residence they also been refused welfare assistance. They also can't afford air tickets back to Britain and, even if they could, they would face a six-month period without benefits because they have been away from the country for more than two years. Mr Crystal, 49, drove petrol tankers in the UK for 20 years before he took up an opportunity to drive for Caltex in New Zealand. They arrived in the country on a work visa in February 2006. They then proceed to set up two successful businesses after following the required five year period and were about to apply for permanent residence when Mr Crystal was diagnosed with his illness. Speaking to the New Zealand Herald, Mr Crystal , who lives in Onewhero, in the northern Waikato, said: 'I was actually driving to a new contract when I had a seizure. 'I just had to pull over. I was gone for 20 minutes.' Following treatment in hospital, doctors removed a lump the size of a golf ball from his brain which has left him with a constant dizzy sensation. If he attempts to work, he has to lie down for about an hour. Horrific: This image shows a picture of Onewhero where the couple live. The family's application for residence was rejected because Mr Crystal's tumour means he can no longer work . He was given just one year to live following his first operation but now, two years later, he has been told he has just a 20 per cent chance of surviving the next three years. Whilst her husband was battling severe illness, Mrs Crystal attempted to keep both businesses going. But after becoming exhausted through working so hard, she became ill with pneumonia last year. The couple then got behind with their bills and payments and their financial problems spiraled out of control. They had to sell a number of possessions, including a van. There was some relief for the family yesterday when the New Zealand government said it had reviewed the family's case and decided it was right to grant the family an emergency benefit while their appeal was being considered. The family's appeal is currently being considered by the Immigration and Protection Tribunal .","Paul and Sarah Crystal have lived in New .

Prosecuted: Jose Paulo Da Silveria skateboarded through a Rememberance Day parade dressed as a devil. His presence infuriated a large crowd which had gathered for the event . A man who gatecrashed a Remembrance Sunday parade on a skateboard wearing a pink outfit and horned mask apologised today for any offence he had caused. Jose Paulo Da Silveria, 38, said he had not intended to disrupt the parade at the Cenotaph in Bristol city centre and had stumbled upon the service accidentally. Da Silveria was wearing striped tights, pink frilly knickers, a corset and had a red and black face cover when he gatecrashed the event. His presence infuriated the large crowd which had gathered and led to threats of violence against him. Speaking today, he said: 'I apologise for the distress but I wasn’t really thinking,' he said. 'I ran into the middle of this thing and I didn’t realise what was going on. 'I was going to College Green and I was just skating along. 'I just came down from Nelson Street and I don’t remember seeing any restrictions and no one was stopping me from carrying on. 'It was only when I saw the photographs in the newspaper that I realised what was going on.' Outside court Da Silveria, wearing black and blue striped stockings, red shorts, a turquoise corset, blue blouse, white gloves, a lace face mask, hat and makeup, added: 'I didn’t take any notice of what was going on around me. 'I recall people being aggressive towards me when I was arrested. 'I am just so sorry for any offence I caused.' Da Silveria was speaking outside Bristol Magistrates’ Court after he received a £65 fine and was ordered to pay £85 costs and £20 victims’ surcharge when he pleaded guilty to an offence under the Public Order Act of using threatening words or behaviour to cause harassment, alarm or distress. For the brief hearing, Da Silveria, from Bristol, had removed his hat and lace mask to sit in the dock of courtroom three. Prosecutor May Lee told the court that Da Silveria was seen at 11.45am riding his skateboard towards the Cenotaph, where large crowds had gathered to watch the parade. 'He was wearing striped tights, pink frilly knickers, a corset and he had a red and black face cover,' she said. 'He was causing harassment, alarm or distress to the public and there was a strong reaction to his presence.' John Roberts, defending, said his client had stopped receiving medication for psychiatric problems but since his arrest his treatment had recommenced. Affront: Horrified onlookers shouted as he disrupted the city's Remembrance Sunday parade . Disgrace: The masked skateboarder, who was wearing pink frilly knickers and corset, was quickly stopped in his tracks by police . 'My client apologises unreservedly for any offence he may have caused to anybody,' Mr Roberts said. 'As far as he is concerned it was not any form of protest. 'His care package had come to an end in August and he was not taking any medication. 'He dresses eccentrically and his intention was to go to College Green but he seems to have got into the cordon.

These shocking pictures show the horrific injuries sustained by a vulnerable man who was bullied, tortured and humiliated by a bigoted couple simply because he has special needs. David Busby, 29, was targeted and belittled by Ross Walsh, 30, and his 36-year old wife Christina for sadistic pleasure when they realised he had severe learning difficulties. After offering their collection of video games and the promises of help with household chores, they lured Mr Busby into their home and subjected him to a series of unwarranted beatings - often in the cellar. Horrific: This picture shows the injuries sustained by David Busby, a vulnerable man with learning disabilities, after he was bullied, tortured and humiliated by a bigoted couple . Bullied: David Busby, 29, was targeted because he had special needs . The 29-year old was said to have been treated 'like a punch bag', as his tormentors got their kicks out of 'exercising control' over him. Walsh would repeatedly punch and kick his victim whilst his hardfaced and icy wife stood by and watched before taking money from Mr Busby. He would then return to his rented home nearby. Mr Busby endured a month-long campaign of attacks, which ended with him suffering 14 smashed ribs, a displaced breast bone, a broken collar bone and extensive bruising and whip marks on his arms, thighs, lower back, chest and kidney area. Police were called in when he was taken to hospital by his landlord who noticed the severity of his injuries. When Walsh was confronted by officers she showed no emotion was not even concerned for her vulnerable neighbour. At Burnley Crown Court the couple, of Accrington, Lancs were convicted of conspiracy to inflict grievous bodily harm with intent, between July and August 2011, after a 12- day trial. Ross was jailed for ten years and his wife got five years. Jailed: David Busby, 29, was targeted and belittled by Ross Walsh, 30, right, and his 36-year old wife Christina, left, for sadistic pleasure . Brothers Faran Abbas, 18, and Sohail Abbas, 20, also of Accrington, were also convicted of conspiracy. Faran was jailed for three and a half years whilst Sohail was jailed for five years. The court heard how Mr Busby had been a frequent visitor to the Walsh’s home after they offered him the chance to 'play video games to his heart’s content'. They also helped him with everyday tasks like washing, cleaning and dividing up his benefit money for rent and shopping. But prosecuting Joe Boyd said: 'Christina and Ross Walsh identified David Busby as a person who was vulnerable as a result of his learning difficulties. 'Together they exploited him by purporting to offer friendship and practical support whilst in fact taking him in and beating him. They just treated him like a punch bag, getting some kind of kick from exercising that control.' The Abbas brothers also went to the property frequently and joined in the violence. One witness told the jury how Ross Walsh stamped on the victim’s chest to a point where he couldn’t breathe. Mr Busby himself described an incident in the cellar in which Ross Walsh held a knife to his shoulder. Mr Busby told police: 'I was punched and kicked, I was hit with some weapons, a metal bar and a cricket bat. It just suddenly changed one day, I cannot remember what changed. I was angry, hurt and scared.' Locked up: Brothers Faran Abbas, 18, left, and Sohail Abbas, 20, right, also went to the property frequently and joined in the violence . The violence was finally discovered when he was sent to a corner shop where his horrified landlord who worked there noticed his horrific injuries. He took Mr Busby to Accrington Victoria Hospital for treatment and staff called in police. After initially telling police the injuries were as a result of a fall, Mr Busby admitted he had been beaten by his 'friends.' Christopher Stephenson, who was lodging at the Walsh’s house at the time, said he had witnessed seven to 10 attacks on Mr Busby and confessed he was 'ashamed' he hadn’t spoken out about it. He said the Walsh’s house was 'an utterly hideous place to live' and added: 'I saw David being punched, kicked, hit with a pole, with a bust lip and swelling to the face. I would hear David screaming.' PC Lisa Mason and PC Jenna Millward said they were sent to the Walsh household by Mr Busby's landlord. PC Mason said: 'Christina didn’t seem too shocked and said she didn’t know anything about the injuries.' PC Millward added: 'There was no emotion. She wasn’t concerned or surprised. There was nothing there.' Hurt: Mr Busby endured a month-long campaign of attacks, which ended with him suffering 14 smashed ribs, a displaced breast bone and a broken collar bone . The court was told because of his learning disability, Mr Busby could not give an exact timeline of his ordeal. The Walshes are now getting divorced. For Christina Walsh, Kevin Donnelly said: 'She is somebody who has been able to make a positive contribution to the lives of others.' Defending Ross Walsh, Philip Holden told the court : 'Of course, I accept there will be some considerable psychological effects upon Mr Busby and that will persist, but in terms of the physical effects, fortunately they appear to have resolved principally.' Sentencing, Judge Andrew Woolman said: 'Mr Busby has sustained appalling injuries and dreadful psychological harm. 'He has not done anything to deserve such an assault from anybody. Undoubtedly the trust he placed in the Walshes was appallingly betrayed. 'The motives are difficult to determine particularly. It may be that David Busby was seen as a source of cash. False tales were put about that he owed the Walshes money when it may be he did not. 'One suggestion for the incident in the cellar was he hadn’t paid over money he supposedly owed to you and that he was taught a lesson. 'But, part of the motive was that he was disabled and couldn’t do anything about it. He didn’t have the wit to complain to the police or anybody else.' The judge told Ross Walsh: 'You behaved in a particularly sadistic way in degrading him down in the cellar.' After the case Jo Davies, policy and campaigns officer at learning disability charity Mencap, said: . 'This is an extremely disturbing case of sickening abuse but unfortunately this kind of ""hate crime"" against people with a learning disability is far more common than most people realise.' Det Con Helen Mercer from Lancashire Police said: 'This was a horrific case where a vulnerable man with learning difficulties has been subjected to mental, financial and physical abuse resulting in multiple fractures and severe bruising. 'It took him several months to divulge even some of the horror of what he had endured. He thought these people were his friends and so couldn’t understand that it was wrong for them to treat him in this way. 'There are no words to describe what they did. They started off as his carer and struck up a friendship with him over eight years before abusing him in the most appalling and dreadful way. It became a wicked game for them. 'It has been extremely distressing for the man and I would like to commend his bravery throughout the trial. 'He is now safe and well and is being looked after. We have supported him throughout the case and will continue to offer him support for as long as he needs.'","David Busby, 29, was targeted and belittled by Ross Walsh, 30, and his 36-year old wife Christina for sadistic pleasure .

You can’t have a good showbiz tale without at least one tear-jerker of a comeback in which the hero, after suffering ridicule and criticism, triumphantly returns to wipe the floor with the opposition. And that’s exactly what gymnast Louis Smith did on Saturday’s Strictly when he did a Charleston that was hailed as the best dance of the night. Having been accused of lacking personality, producers unpacked and dusted down the ‘acting coach’ that they like to wheel out every series to inject a dose of luvviness into a chosen celebrity’s performance. Scroll down for video . Acrobatic display: Olympic silver medallist Louis Smith performs a somersault during his routine with dance partner Flavia Cacace . Rapturous applause: The audience got a bit carried away after seeing Louis's Charleston . By the time the coach had finished . with little Louis he could pull faces and do jazz hands with the best of . them. He gurned his way through the Charleston like Lionel Blair on . acid, even throwing in a moonwalk and a somersault for good measure. Following . the disappointment of his Paso Doble the previous week and his . subsequent savaging by the nasty, mean judges, it brought the house . down. Almost literally. The . studio audience – largely made up of middle-aged housewives – got a bit . carried away, not only giving him the obligatory standing ovation but . also whooping and noisily stamping their feet in appreciation. They’ll . all be rioting in their cul-de-sacs if Louis isn’t in the final in three . weeks’ time. Always a professional: Denise drew on her stage experience and carried on with her routine despite partner James forgetting part of the routine . Powering through: Denise was praised for keeping calm and carrying on after James lost his way during the dance . His sterling efforts earned him a 37  from the judges, including 10s from Darcey and Bruno. With . Louis stealing the show, Denise Van Outen lost her place at the top of . the leaderboard thanks to an uncharacteristically messy salsa. Stealing more than a few of Fern . Britton’s skirt-flapping, Cockney knees-up moves, Denise’s dance was . nowhere near the standard we’ve come to expect from her. Matters . weren’t helped by her dance partner James Jordan forgetting his routine . halfway through, standing on the dancefloor rather like a lemon waiting . for the number 14 bus to  come along. It’s . understandable when the celebrities forget what they’re doing but hard . to summon up much sympathy for a trained professional. Pulling all the stops out: Even though Michael Vaughn was determined not the end up in the dance-off, he was voted off . Despite all this, Craig Revel Horwood still saw fit to award Denise and James’s performance an eight out of ten – the same score he gave Louis’s totally flawless Charleston. He wasn’t the only judge behaving strangely on Saturday. Bruno Tonioli, an excitable chap at the best of times, seemed to have really overindulged on the orange Smarties. Not only did he actually fall off his chair, he gave viewers more innuendo and double entendres than a Carry On film boxset. While the male judges may be misbehaving, Darcey Bussell is becoming more delightful with each passing week. I love her constructive criticisms, quirky tips and easy banter with the panel. I think she’s been a breath of fresh air for Strictly. After getting great scores for his Charleston last week, Nicky Byrne was hoping to build on that success with his Argentine Tango performed to Adele’s Skyfall. Is it my imagination or have Bond themes become almost compulsory for Strictly tangos? Unfortunately, rather than capturing the passion and drama of the dance, Nicky looked more like he was paying his own one-man tribute to Monty Python’s Ministry of Silly Walks as his legs flailed around uncontrollably. I can only assume that after a decade of sitting on a stool as part of Westlife, he has a lot of leg-using time to make up for. It was no surprise when Nicky ended up in the dance-off. It was also no surprise that he was joined there by Michael Vaughan, following the cricketer’s uniquely arthritic interpretation of the samba. ‘I am going to do everything I can to make sure I don’t end up in the dance-off,’ said Michael before performing. And, you’ve got to hand it to him, he pulled all the stops out. He unbuttoned his shirt, slapped on the fake tan and had his dance partner Natalie stand in front of him throughout. However, none of this could hide the fact that his Latin dances are always a clunky, funk-free zone. Even though Michael was voted off last night, he was a great competitor who’ll be fondly remembered for his brilliant American Smooth at Wembley – if not for his ‘dad-dancing’ samba... Now watch Louis Smith's Charleston...","CLAUDIA CONNELL: VIEW FROM THE SOFA .

To add insult to injury Lindsay's bank accounts have been frozen by the IRS after failing to pay tax from 2009- 2011, TMZ claims. Begging: Lindsay Lohan's friends are desperate for the troubled star to check into rehab ahead of appearing in court for violating her probation .

According to TMZ, close friends of Lohan's are urging her to check into a treatment facility before she has appear in court as it could curry favour with the judge. However, Lohan has emphatically told them she does not have an alcohol problem and has used the fact she has recently completed three movies as proof, the website also reports. But on Monday it emerged Lohan, 26, is 'freaked out' about the possibility of spending Christmas behind bars. Boozing hard: The 25-year-old is said to be downing up to two bottles of vodka a day because of the stress of both her summer car crash and a recent bar brawl in NY where she was charged with misdemeanor assault . 'Lindsay knows it's almost a foregone . conclusion that even if she admits to the probation violation without . having a formal hearing, and throws herself at the mercy of the judge, . she would be sentenced to significant jail time,' a source told RadarOnline. Lindsay previously served 13 days in . jail in 2010, she said it was the darkest time of her life, her . arraignment is December 15, and although she wasn't summoned to appear . the judge may now choose to make her as of her lengthy criminal history. This news comes just a few days after her father Michael apparently implored her to check into the Betty Ford clinic. 'I just want her to go into rehab. I love her and I just want her to get the help she needs,' he told told HollyScoop.com. However his pleas have fallen on deaf ears as Lohan refuses to speak to him after he leaked a private phone conversation between them to the press, apparently saying he is 'dead to her'. Michael added: 'I have called, but of course she has not picked up.' He said in another report: 'Do I believe Lindsay the new reports that Lindsay is drinking two litres of vodka a day? 'I believe she's drinking to drown her sorrows. When I was at the Chateau Marmont I saw bottles. People tell me what she's doing.' Stubborn: Despite the fact she faces jail time and rehab may help her case Lohan is said to be point blank refusing to go. Pictured out in NY in November . TMZ also report that Lohan is actually drinking all day at the moment and the night of the alleged attack she was 'hammered'. They also claim that sources have said the Mean Girls actress gets 'violent' when she's drunk. According to reports, Lohan allegedly punched a woman called Tiffany Ava Mitchell in the face at Avenue club after the Justin Bieber concert because they were fighting over Max George from boy band The Wanted. Lindsay's financial woes are also taking their toll on the actress. According to TMZ Lindsay owes $233,904 in unpaid federal taxes and the IRS have seized her bank accounts. Although Charlie Sheen generously paid Lindsay $100,000 to help with her tax problem it has now emerged that she owes money for 2011 too.

Fly-half Quade Cooper has finally ended speculation surrounding his future by signing a new two-year deal with the Australian Rugby Union and Queensland. It will be unwelcome news for the Lions, who will face the Wallabies in three Tests next year. Cooper has been shrouded in controversy after publicly declaring the Wallabies had become a 'toxic environment' in September. His comments on Twitter and in interviews upset both teammates and Wallabies coach Robbie Deans. Cooper (left) has accepted a two-year deal with both the Queensland Reds and the Wallabies . He was fined 60,000 Australian dollars and offered an incentive-based contract with the ARU last month, which he rejected. Details of the latest offer have not yet been released, but it is rumoured that the fly-half turned down an offer from a French club that would have made him one of the richest players in the world in order to continue playing for Australia. The British Lions face Australia for three Tests next summer and the 24-year-old said: 'It’s no secret that I have a strong passion and desire to represent Queensland and Australia. I love playing for the Reds and the Wallabies. 'It’s a great feeling to know that things are sorted and now I can continue to improve as a player and as a member of the Queensland Reds and the Wallabies.

Prosecuted: The principal of a special school walked in on female care worker Amanda McNally, pictured, who had been having sex with a 17-year-old boy, it has emerged . The principal of a special school walked in on a female care worker who had been having sex with a 17-year-old boy, it has emerged. Amanda McNally, 41, was found hiding behind a bed with the half naked teenager in his room at the boarding school in Hertfordshire. When the principal walked in, he saw a silhouette behind the bed. The boy - who has a mental age of 13 - suddenly emerged without his top on. McNally then appeared saying they had been looking for a paint brush as they were decorating his flat, St Albans crown court heard today. Prosecutor Michael Speak said the boy, who suffers from epilepsy and is subject to seizures and depression, confessed to having sex with McNally the next day. The police were called and in a recorded interview the boy said: 'She was being nice but she took advantage of me.' He said they had penetrative sex in the flat. He said sex had happened before between them, but she had only been charged with one offence. DNA tests confirmed that they had engaged in sexual activity. Mr Speak said McNally, who has a 17-year-old son of her own, had worked as a house care assistant at the school for 3 years, with a 6 month break. 'Her responsibilities were to get the children up, prepare their breakfast, to get them to have a wash and clean their houses and do the shopping. 'At half past three they would return from school and her duties would be to make tea. The care workers are described by the Principal as surrogate parents,' he said. In a victim impact statement the boy said he had been left feeling 'insecure and felt suicidal waking up at night.' He went on: 'She said she was my friend. I can’t trust her. Now I am in a black hole.' McNally, 41, from Ware, Hertfordshire, admitted sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust on February 22 this year. She gave no comment to police interviews. She was of previous good character. Stephen Requena, defending, asked for credit for her guilty plea. In a text sent to the boy earlier she had said the relationship should end. Locked up: McNally was jailed for 14 months and banned from ever working with children at St Albans Crown Court today . At the time her friendship with the boy was the only happiness in her life, he said. She had married at 23, but separated from her husband in 2005. In January this year they divorced after he said he wanted to marry another woman. He said McNally was supported by family and friends and handed the judge references which described her as 'caring and loving.' Judge Stephen Warner told her: 'You were in a position of trust. You befriended him and his family. It was not an isolated incident and only stopped when you were discovered. 'This was a highly inappropriate relationship. He was 17, you were 41. He was vulnerable and compliant. You took advantage to enter into this relationship. You knew it was wrong but you persisted.' He jailed her for 14 months and banned her from ever working with children.

He told the city council about his . affair during a closed meeting last week and sent out the statement to . address rumors swirling in the community. Some council members reportedly wanted the mayor to resign, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. Councilwoman Ruth Jensen told the newspaper: 'Even with this confession, people might forgive, but they won’t forget. 'As a leader of our town, I don’t see how he can get over it.'

I am guilty of indiscretions that occurred during this continuation period.I recognized the need to completely terminate that relationship and I have confided the details of my transgressions to my family and my church leaders. They are assisting me in the repentance process. I have asked their forgiveness and understanding and I’m grateful it has been extended.We are working through these issues together.As your mayor, I am asking for your forgiveness and understanding.

He could drive his friends crazy with his incessant talking. But all he really wanted, by all accounts, was to fit in. When detectives found the 27-year-old autistic man's body buried in the woods months after he disappeared, they uncovered what investigators say was a horrific story of family violence. His half brother, Jeffrey Vogelsberg, had repeatedly tortured and abused Graville, prosecutors say, and the beatings finally went too far. Horrific crime: Matthew Graville (pictured left) who had Asperger's Syndrome, was allegedly tortured and murdered by his stepbrother Jeffrey Vogelsberg (right) in Mazomanie, Wisconsin . '[Vogelsberg] is someone who deserves to be hung up... and left to be tortured,' said Richard Swangstu, who befriended Graville when they were teenagers living in a foster home. 'Matt was a brother to me. I didn't lose a friend. I lost family.' Vogelsberg is charged with first-degree intentional homicide. An extradition hearing in Washington state, where Vogelsberg moved after Graville's death last summer, is scheduled for Thursday. Vogelsberg's attorney, Lisa Contris, didn't return several messages, and Vogelsberg didn't respond to a letter requesting an interview. Another man who owned the house where Vogelsberg and Graville lived is accused of helping to hide Graville's body. Robert McCumber told investigators he . went to bed listening to Vogelsberg beat Graville in the bathroom, but . he also said the beatings were nothing new. House of horrors: This photo shows the home in Mazomanie, Wisconsin, where prosecutors say Vogelsberg beat and tortured Granvile to death . When he woke up on July 1, Graville was dead on his couch; Vogelsberg was gone – on his way to Missouri to see his wife graduate from U.S. Army basic training at Fort Leonard Wood. Graville was born with Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism marked by an inability to read social cues, repetitive routines and clumsiness. Criminals have long preyed on the disabled.The violent victimization rate for the . disabled 2010 was 28 per 1,000 people, almost twice the rate among . non-disabled people, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Accomplice? Landlord Robert McCumber allegedly helped Vogelsberg by hiding Graville's body . Still, Graville's case left Wisconsin investigators shocked. 'In 33 years, 25 as a detective, I . find it difficult to find another case where an individual took . advantage of a developmentally disabled male for their own . entertainment,' Dane County Sheriff Dave Mahoney told reporters at a . news conference to announce the charges. 'Matthew lived a living hell.' Graville's early life is murky. At some point he ended up foster care. Those records are confidential and his biological mother, Vicki Graville, declined to comment, saying she doesn't want to jeopardize the investigation into her son's death. When he was 16 or 17, Graville moved into a foster home, where he roomed with Swangstu. At first Graville drove him 'up the wall' with his incessant talking, Swangstu said, but as he learned more about Asperger's, he took Graville under his wing. They went to high school together and they worked at the local McDonald's. Graville was happy, Swangstu said. He loved listening to rap music, watching funny movies, whittling walking sticks or sitting outside. 'Enjoying the simplicities of life,' Swangstu said of the time they spent together. 'Sitting around a . bonfire. Drinking soda. Watching fireworks go off. Playing catch in our . yard. ... Matt was a loving, kind, gentle soul.' Eventually . Graville moved out of the foster home and somehow connected with . Vogelsberg, his 28-year-old half-brother. Vogelsberg and Graville went . on to rent McCumber's house in Mazomanie, a village of about 1,650 . people 25 miles west of Madison. Brutal end: Police retrieved the 28 year old's corpse from rural woods in Lone Rock, Wisconsin . Court records show Vogelsberg had been in trouble with the law before. He had been convicted of siphoning gas from vehicles, shooting a man with a BB gun and throwing his dog down his apartment stairs. A former landlord accused him of blowing up her chicken with a bottle rocket. Vogelsberg's grandfather reported Graville missing in July. Weeks went by with no sight of him. In September, investigators caught a break when county workers notified them someone had used Graville's food stamp card at a Madison grocery store two weeks after he disappeared. Mommy dearest: Matthew's stepmother Laura Robar allegedly stole from his bank accounts after his death . According to the criminal complaint, store surveillance video identified the card user as Vogelsberg's mother, Laura Robar, who has since been charged with identity theft. She led investigators to McCumber, who told them that Vogelsberg regularly abused Graville, beating him and shooting him with a BB gun repeatedly, according to the complaint. Finally, Vogelsberg became convinced Graville was poisoning Vogelsberg's children and started beating him in the bathroom. McCumber said he didn't interfere because Robar was there and he thought she wouldn't let things get out of hand. When he found Graville's body the next day, he called Vogelsberg, who told him to wrap the body in plastic and place it in a chest freezer in the garage, according to the criminal complaint. Several days later, he and Vogelsberg buried Graville in the woods along the Wisconsin River. McCumber said Vogelsberg had a pistol and he was afraid he might kill him. Vogelsberg was arrested on November 5 in Washington state, where he moved after his wife was assigned to a base near Tacoma. He remains in custody with no bail. McCumber is set to be arraigned later this month. His attorney could not be reached for comment. Robar is set to stand trial early next year. Her attorney, Jason Gonazlez, said in court Wednesday that Robar was involved with making 'some really bad decisions' and is cooperating with detectives, but he doesn't believe prosecutors can prove all the elements of identity theft. Assistant District Attorney Robert Kaiser said in court Wednesday that Robar has said she will do anything to protect her son. Swangstu said he will always be angry at Graville's family. 'There won't be a day when I don't resent what his family did,' he said. 'He was doing everything he needed to do until he connected with his real family. His real family ruined it.'","Jeffrey Vogelsberg charged with torturing and killing half-brother Matthew Graville, who suffered from Asperger's syndrome .

The Mesa County sheriff's department were examining the SUV, including the emissions system for the presence of carbon monoxide. The boys' grandfather Robert Mathena told Fox 31 that he believed the boys had carbon monoxide poisoning. William's cause of death has not been released. Mr Mathena said that Tyler's condition is improving and that 'he's opening his eyes, looking around'.

Heather Jensen was widowed after her 26-year-old husband Eric was killed when his car was hit head-on by an SUV on October 10. The other driver suffered minor injuries. Mrs Jensen told investigators that she had gone to meet a male friend on Tuesday night when the tragedy took place. According to the Daily Sentinel, she let the boys play in the snow before putting them back in her Toyota 4Runner and turning the engine on. She then sat in the man's truck for around an hour and a half, police investigators said.

Standing in tranquil gardens and orchards, Anne Hathaway’s cottage provided an idyllic setting for William Shakespeare to court his future wife. But a tempest is brewing around the 16th century thatched farmhouse after developers were given permission to build up to 800 homes, a 1.3-mile road, school, shops, business units and a health centre on land as close as  238 yards to the immaculately preserved tourist attraction and its grounds. The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, which owns the historic cottage, yesterday said it was ‘extremely disappointed’ with the decision by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles to rubber-stamp the plans, which it said would do ‘irreversible harm’ to the setting of the property. The government has given the go-ahead for 800 homes to be built near Anne Hathaway's cottage . The house, which is a tourist attraction, will now be joined by another 800 homes . Furious: MP for Stratford Nadhim Zahawi (pictured here with Cameron at the Tory party conference) told the House of Commons his constituents' faith in the localism agenda had been shattered 'in a single stroke' The local MP, Nadhim Zahawi, went further, warning MPs during  a debate on the decision that the future of a house that had survived ‘the English Reformation, the English Civil War and even 13 years of Labour’ may now have been jeopardised by the ‘careless stroke of a planning inspector’s pen’. The proposed development at the hamlet of Shottery – a mile from Shakespeare’s birthplace of Stratford-upon-Avon – had originally been thrown out by the local council last year. Builder Bloor Homes appealed against the decision and the Secretary of State last month upheld a planning inspector’s recommendation to allow the appeal. Mr Pickles approved it on the basis it met a ‘significant’ need for housing, provided new local facilities and said the relief road would provide ‘modest’ transport benefits. In an impassioned speech on Tuesday, Mr Zahawi told MPs the decision ‘grants permission for a village-sized development to be welded to the side of this vitally important historic town, building a new link road directly behind the cottage in which William Shakespeare’s wife grew up’. He said Hathaway was ‘an integral part of Shakespeare’s story which is in itself an integral part of the story of this island, our culture and our language’. Eric Pickles gave developers the go-ahead to build the homes near William Shakespeare's wife's residence . Stratford-upon-Avon Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi has blasted the ruling and accused Mr Pickles of defying the will of Parliament . The nearest new home on the two-site . development will be 238 yards from the Hathaway family home, while the . 1.3-mile relief road crucial to the scheme passes 268 yards from the . cottage where it is said Shakespeare wooed his bride-to-be. According to . records, they married in 1582. There remains one glimmer of light for residents opposed to the scheme.

Breast cancer deaths can be halved after 10 years of treatment with the drug tamoxifen, research has shown. The widely used drug prevents oestrogen fuelling breast cancer in hormone-sensitive patients. Usual current practice is to administer daily tamoxifen for five years. This is known to reduce death rates by around a third during the first 15 years after diagnosis. The new trial, called Atlas, looked at the effect of taking tamoxifen for a total of 10 years after diagnosis. Atlas recruited almost 7,000 women with oestrogen-sensitive cancer who were completing five years of tamoxifen treatment. Half stopped their treatment immediately while the remainder continued taking the drug for five more years. Initially . there little difference was seen between the two groups, said the . scientists. But after 10 years the additional benefits of longer . treatment emerged in women who continued taking tamoxifen. The risk of dying during the second decade after diagnosis was further reduced by about a quarter, leading to a total halving of death rates. Most of the extra protection occurred after the end of the 10 year treatment period. Tamoxifen - most of the extra protection occurred after the end of the 10 year treatment period . Atlas trial leader Dr Christina Davies, from Oxford University, said: 'Around three-quarters of all UK women with breast cancer have hormone sensitive disease, and Atlas shows that 10 years of tamoxifen helps save lives not just during the decade women are taking the drug, but also during the second decade after diagnosis.' Tamoxifen is known to increase the risk of womb cancer in post-menopausal women. Atlas showed that the extra risk of dying from this disease due to tamoxifen was two per 1,000 women after five years, and four per 1,000 after 10 years. The trial findings are published today in The Lancet medical journal.Martin Ledwick, from Cancer Research UK, which funded the research, said: 'This important study adds further clarity to the question about the length of time women should take tamoxifen. 'Although treatment for hormone receptor positive breast cancer has become more complex in recent years with some women receiving aromatese inhibitors, these results will help in deciding the length of treatment for women who are prescribed tamoxifen alone.'","Tamoxifen is an anti-oestrogen drug that was developed over 30 years ago .

A mug of hot chocolate before bed is not usually seen as a prelude to an evening of whirlwind passion. That may be about to change, though, with the introduction  of a ‘turbo-charged’ type of chocolate said to have Viagra-like properties. The world’s largest chocolate-maker has developed a technique to concentrate levels of key plant chemicals called flavanols. 'Turbo-charged': The world's largest chocolate maker has developed a technique to make chocolate have Viagra-like properties . These are found in cocoa beans but are normally stripped out in the chocolate-making process. Swiss-based chocolate giant Barry Callebaut is said to be just weeks away from getting the go-ahead from the EU to claim the ‘turbo-charged’ chocolate boosts health by increasing blood flow. Industry experts say it will then be only a matter of time before it is incorporated into novelty chocolates, pastes and drinks that, like Viagra, use a rush of blood to stop a man from being a flop in the bedroom.

So when she was given the option of saving her life, she certainly didn't think twice. Ms Rogers from Betley, Staffordshire, gave part of her own liver to 13-month-old Imogen who was awaiting a transplant. Little Imogen was diagnosed with biliary atresia when she was just nine weeks old. The rare condition meant that Imogen was . born without any bile ducts, making it impossible for her to break down . fats in her diet, causing a severe strain on her liver. Scroll down for video . Charlotte Rogers donated half of her own liver to save the life of her baby daughter Imogen . In a worst case scenario, the bile could have built up in little Imogen's liver and poisoned her to death. Imogen had been on the transplant list for five months but it soon become clear that urgent action was needed to save her life. And after a friend mentioned to Ms . Rogers, 34, and partner Sebastian Daly, the possibility of donation from . a living donor, the couple never looked back. Imogen (with parents Charlotte and Sebastian) was born without any bile ducts, making it impossible for her to break down fats in her diet, causing a severe strain on her liver . Ms Rogers said: 'When I found out that it was possible to take a liver from a living person it was a no brainer, I knew I was going to give mine to Imogen. 'I'd cut my arm off for my little girl if I someone needed me to, so I really didn't think twice about it.' Imogen was initially diagnosed with the condition this time last year, just . a few days before Christmas. Her mother said: 'Her . newborn jaundice never cleared so we took her to the doctors. I wasn't . really concerned at the time, I just thought it would be something . minor. 'But the doctor booked us in for blood tests at the hospital and on Christmas Eve, she was being operated on. It was a really scary time.' Mother and daughter both went under the knife on September 5th and are recovering well . The aim of Imogen's initial . operation was to re-plumb her liver in the hope that bile could be . emptied from the liver and she could be cured. However, after three hours under the knife, it became clear that the operation had not been successful. The family was forced to spend . Christmas day in hospital with just three other people on the ward. Shortly afterwards, they learned of the living liver transplant procedure. 'We got the ball rolling straight away,' said Ms Rogers. 'You need to go through quite a lot, and before I could have any tests to see if I was compatible I had to loose about 30lbs, so it was about May or June time before they would even start looking at me. 'When I lost the weight I had to have scans of my liver, an abdomen MRI, and numerous X-rays. I had 18 blood samples taken in a single day at one point - and I'm scared of needles! 'We then got a date for the donation at the end of July but the doctor felt we should wait as long as possible to give Imogen as much time with her own liver as possible, so it wasn't until the end of August that the operation went ahead.' The left side of Charlotte's liver was removed to be given to Imogen. Because the liver regenerates, the right side of Charlotte's liver will grow to compensate the missing piece. Imogen will also grow a full-sized liver . Mother and daughter both went under the knife on September 5 this year - when Imogen was just 11 months old. 'I think Sebastian was in a meltdown,' recalled Ms Rogers. 'Having both of his girls under anaesthetic at the same time - and in two different hospitals - was just awful for him.' In the complex operations that took a massive nine hours to complete, the left side of Charlotte's liver was removed at Queen Elizabeth's Hospital in Birmingham and whisked over to Birmingham Children's Hospital to be given to Imogen. The liver regenerates, meaning that the right side of Charlotte's liver will grow to compensate the missing piece. The left side of the liver given to Imogen, will also grow to a full sized liver. Following the operation, Ms Rogers had to wait an agonising six days before she got to see her daughter. 'Luckily the transplant coordinator took lots of pictures for me so I could see that she was PK. 'But when I saw her it was just lovely and she did brilliantly. She got out of intensive care before I did.' She added: 'We've both been recovering really well. I tend to get quite tired but Imogen just hasn't looked back - it's like she's pressed fast forward. 'If I hadn't given Imogen part of my liver, we could still be going to bed every night wondering if we'd be woken up with a phone call telling us they'd found a donor. 'So may people die waiting for transplants - Imogen could so easily not have made it.' Throughout the process, Imogen's family have been busy raising money for the Children's Liver disease foundation. The family and their friends have also managed to raise £40,000 for the Children's Liver Disease Foundation during Imogen's treatment . Ms Rogers explained: 'We've done a bit of fundraising to say thank you. Sebastian did the great North Run - and lost 5 stone to do it - and we've also held a charity ball with a yellow theme. 'Overall we've raised about £40,000 - we're just really pleased we could help.' Catherine Arkley, Chief Executive of . Children's Liver Disease Foundation, said: 'It is wonderful to see . Imogen doing so well now and I'm sure this Christmas will be a really . special one for the family. 'CLDF has been in contact with Seb and Charlotte ever since Imogen was diagnosed with biliary atresia, providing information about her condition as well as emotional support. 'The amazing thing about this family is that during a truly anxious and worrying time they have enabled a huge amount of fundraising for us - £40,000 to date. Lisa Burnapp, Lead Nurse for Living Donation at NHS Blood and Transplant, said: 'It is wonderful that this family have had the opportunity to restore their lives through a living liver transplant for their daughter. 'Most liver transplants are carried out using organs that are donated after death and, whilst overall numbers remain stable, many patients die waiting for a suitable organ to become available. 'Due to welcome advances in road safety and prevention of catastrophic strokes through early detection and treatment of high blood pressure, the number of organs available for transplantation has fallen. 'I strongly urge everyone to join the NHS Organ Donor Register so that you can help someone who is in need of a life-saving organ transplant like Imogen.

Despite over half of Britons (58 per cent) attempting to cook their first festive meal at 24 years old, they won’t have the annual feast fully mastered for a further 12 years, when they hit 36. So celebrities like Emma Bunton, or Bond girl, Naomie Harris, both in the prime of the Christmas dinner making skills at 36, should serve up the perfect turkey, according to research from supermarket Asda. Don't stuff it up! It takes an average of 12 years practice to perfect the perfect Christmas feast . For over half of home cooks (51 per cent), the trickiest part of the annual celebrations are the timings. The huge array of different courses, trimmings and varying cooking times makes the day a scheduling nightmare. Making sure the meat is cooked to perfection is the most problematic part of the dinner for over a third of would-be chefs (37 per cent). Surprisingly, almost a fifth (18 per cent) admit to having bought their main Christmas meat without having checked whether it will fit in their oven first. When it comes to learning the necessary Christmas dinner cooking skills, mum really does know best – 83 per cent  of people say their biggest cooking influence is their mother. However one in ten can’t cope with the thought of being responsible for the meal and say they will never even attempt to cook a Christmas dinner. At 36 Emma Bunton should have perfected her turkey basting skills . The average Brit polishes off turkey and all the trimmings - and a spot of Christmas pudding - in just 30 minutes and 44 seconds after spending three hours and 30 minutes spent shopping for the food and a further 42 minutes in the kitchen cooking the meal. TV chefs, who each claim to know the best way to prepare Christmas roast, inspire almost half (47 per cent) of cooks. However only 4 per cent  of people surveyed said that following celebrity chefs have actually made them a better cook. It seems that practice and persistence is key, as 43 per cent of confident cooks say they’re self-taught, with 12 years being the optimum amount of rehearsal time. Jim Viggars, Asda’s head of meat quality said: ‘The highlight of many people’s Christmas day is the food. But cooking the Christmas dinner shouldn’t give you beef. ‘The trick to avoid stuffing up is plenty of preparation. Use the days and weeks ahead of the 25th December to perfect each individual part, so you’re not panicking on the day.

They found children born after IVF have a twofold higher risk of wheezing and are up to four times more likely to take anti-asthmatic medicines by the age of five. Scientists discovered the link after analysing data on 18,818 children from across the UK born between 2000 and 2002. Higher risk after IVF: Children born after fertility treatment have double the risk of developing asthma, researchers claim . But they say the findings do not prove that asthma is triggered by IVF and any children born as a result remain at low risk. Over 1.4 million British children have asthma and rates have shot up four-fold since the 1970s. The causes of the disease are poorly understood, but genetic and environmental factors are thought to play roughly equal roles. Researchers conducting the UK . Millennium Cohort Study compared children in different groups with those . born after natural planned pregnancies. Children born to sub-fertile parents . were 39 per cent more likely to be experiencing asthma symptoms by the . age of five and 27 per cent more likely to wheeze than children born . after planned pregnancies. But closer analysis found a stronger . link between asthma and children conceived via some form of assisted . reproduction treatment including IVF (in vitro fertilisation). They had a risk of developing asthma . more than two-and-a-half times higher, nearly two-fold increased risk of . wheezing and more than four-fold increased risk of taking . anti-asthmatic medications. First UK study: Researchers from Oxford University (pictured) conducted the study and found that IVF children were also twice as likely to develop wheezing and up to four times more likely to have taken anti-asthma medicine by the age of five . The risks were slightly reduced at the age of seven, according to a report in the medical journal Human Reproduction. The researchers said their findings . should be interpreted with caution as only 104 children in the study . were born after fertility treatment. Lead researcher Dr Claire Carson, . from Oxford University, said ‘Childhood asthma is a common condition in . the UK where the prevalence of the condition is higher than other . European countries, and to our knowledge this is the first UK study of . asthma after IVF conceptions. ‘Our analysis suggests that it is the assisted reproduction group in particular who are at higher risk.’ There could be a number of possible . explanations for the link between infertility, IVF and asthma, including . the severity of the infertility and possible role played by treatment, . say the researchers. The scientists took account of . mothers’ asthma and smoking history, body mass index - which relates . weight to height - socio-economic status, the presence of furry . household pets and other factors previously suspected to be asthma . triggers that could have affected the findings. In the paper they wrote: 'Children . born after ART have a much higher risk, though we cannot determine if . this is indicative of a treatment effect or related to a greater degree . of sub-fertility in this group of parents. Linked: Research found that there was a strong link between asthma and children conceived via some form of assisted reproduction treatment including IVF (pictured) 'If the observed association is . causal, then the mechanism driving it remains unknown and further . research in this area is warranted.' Dr Carson said it was important to . remember that in absolute terms the extra number of IVF children . developing asthma was small. She said: ‘Fifteen per cent of the . children in our study had asthma at the age of five. Although this . figure was higher, 24 per cent, in the IVF children, it isn’t much . higher than the one in five risk for all children in the UK. ‘It is . also important to remember that for most children, asthma is a . manageable condition and shouldn’t prevent children from living a full . and active life.’ Malayka Rahman, research analysis and . communications officer at Asthma UK, said ‘This study suggests that . there might be an association between IVF treatment and asthma . developing in children, but the sample size for this study is small and . currently the research in this area generally is not conclusive. ‘Overall research suggests that the absolute risk of asthma increasing after IVF appears to be small. ‘Further work is needed to establish . what might be causing this association and whether there are other . factors at play other than the IVF treatment itself. ‘In the meantime those considering . IVF should speak to their GP about the benefits and health risks in . order to make an informed decision.’","IVF children were also twice as likely to develop wheezing and up to four times more likely to have taken anti-asthma medicine by the age of five .

Going to waste: An American company says it has developed a technique to keep bread mould-free for two months. It uses microwave technology to kill mould-forming spores . With a third of bread bought by the British public ending up in the bin, one company has used its loaf...to develop a technique that keeps the mould away for two months. Scientists claim to have developed a microwave technique which sterilises food without cooking, helping to extend its shelf-life and minimise the use of preservatives. As well as keeping a loaf of bread fresh for 60 days, the method can be used to treat a range of foods including fresh turkey, herbs, fruit and vegetables. The average British family dumps food worth £680 every year, creating a vast mountain of rotting waste. A fifth of all food coming into the home is thrown away, mainly fruit, vegetables, dairy products and other perishables such as bread and meat. The nation dumps 7.2million tons of food worth £12billion annually – enough to fill Wembley Stadium nine times. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs says that 32 per cent of bread bought in Britain is thrown out. In normal conditions, bread can go mouldy in as little as a week. But a method developed by American firm MicroZap could extend its shelf-life by weeks. The technology uses pulsed microwaves to pasteurise food at low temperatures ‘without damaging or changing the quality’. A loaf of bread needs about ten seconds to treat. The company says the method was first developed to treat salmonella in eggs, adding: ‘Bread was also used in the research, showing that it too could be treated and the moulding process could be slowed down significantly. Even after a whole 60 days, the treated bread was compared to that of fresh bread in both quality and freshness.’ Unlike conventional microwave ovens, there are no hot and cold spots in the machines used in this process, according to the manufacturers. Chief executive Don Stull admitted it might be difficult to convince consumers of the benefits of long-life bread. He said: ‘We’ll have to get some consumer acceptance of that. Most people do it by feel and if you still have that quality feel, they probably will accept it.’ Going to waste: According to Defra figures, nearly one-in-three loaves in the UK is thrown in the bin .","Microwave technology can kill the spores that lead to mould .

Two young boys who were playing at a pool last summer discovered they looked incredibly similar – they even had the same walk. But Isaac Noltin, 12, and Dakotah Zimmer, 13, were in for the shock of their lives to discover there was more than met the eye with their similar appearances: they were brothers. Dakotah told Isaac that he knew he had a brother he’d never met who was adopted by a woman named Dawn. ‘That’s my mom’s name,’ Isaac responded. Issac (left) and Dakotah were reunited after being apart for over ten years when they met at swimming pool in Washington, Missouri . The touching story of how Dakotah and Isaac met is one of anxiety for Isaac’s adoptive mother, Dawn Noltin. Ms Noltin, who works as a manager for a dry-cleaning company, told her story to TODAY.com and the eMissourian, saying that she wrestled with when to tell her son that he was adopted. For weeks before Isaac and Dakotah met, she had been asking her friends and pastor how to tell her son that he had a brother, but knew it had to be before the boys started school. They would be attending the same middle school in Washington, Missouri and would surely find out one way or another. The night after Isaac and Dakotah met, Isaac approached his mother and asked if he was adopted. When Ms Nolting, 42, asked why he thought that, her son responded: ‘Because I think I found my brother.’ Siblings: 'I could tell because of the nose,' said Dakotah Zimmer (middle, with siblings Ashley and Issac) of how he knew that a boy he had met by chance at the pool was actually his younger brother . The mother and son both started crying. ‘I was so happy that I had a brother,’ Isaac explained to TODAY.com. ‘I . had always asked for one.’ Ms Nolting had met Isaac’s mother . several years ago when she was heading out to dinner with her . ex-husband. A friend of Ms Nolting’s ex-husband invited them to meet his . girlfriend and their newborn son. The 16-year-old mother had just given birth to Isaac nine days before, and also had a one-year-old son – Dakotah. Ms . Noltin had been a single mother herself, having her own daughter at 19. She told TODAY.com that her maternal instincts kicked in, and she . offered to take care of the newborn. Months passed, and Ms Noltin received a . call that Isaac’s biological mother was pregnant again. The woman’s . grandmother asked if Ms Noltin wished to legally adopt Isaac. Eighteen . months later, and Isaac was legally hers. Family: Issac poses for a photograph with his adoptive mother Dawn . Isaac and Dakotah's  biological mother died in 2007, and their biological father died a year later. Dakotah and his older sister, Ashley, live with their's and Isaac's biological grandmother - Debi Bay. Ms Bay said that Dakotah always knew he had a brother. ‘I’m just glad they got to meet,’ she said of her grandsons’ clandestine encounter.

Eleven years after their adoptive father was bludgeoned to death by their mother's lover in their Hamptons mansion, the Ammon twins have revealed the guilt they endured following his murder. In their first interview, Alexa and Greg Ammon, now 22, spoke out about how their mother had turned them against their father before his death, as she used them as pawns in her bitter divorce battle. And the manipulation was so successful that Alexa was left carrying the guilt 'for years' over her final scathing words to her father before he was murdered in October 2001, when she was just 11. 'It's hard to know that the last thing you said before your dad died was that you hated him,' Alexa told Katie Couric. Struggle: Alexa and Greg Ammon speak with Katie Couric about their adopted father's murder . Battle: They spoke about how their mother turned them against their father before his murder in 2001 . Ted and Generosa Ammon had the picture perfect family after they adopted the twins as toddlers from a Ukrainian orphanage, but after 17 years of marriage, the relationship began to crumble. Following their separation, as Generosa fought for half of his $80 million fortune, things turned ugly. Greg explained to Katie: 'There were times if we weren't awful to . our father or spying on him, or going through his drawers, mom would be really awful to us back home.' Alexa added: 'She just hated the fact that we loved our father, that we loved a man she didn't love anymore.' Picture perfect: Ted and Generosa Ammon adopted the children from a Ukrainian orphanage as toddlers . Lavish: They still own the mansion in East Hampton where their father was found dead . Instead, their mother encouraged they love her boyfriend, an electrician from Long Island named Danny Pelosi, who divorced his own wife three months after their father's death - and the man eventually convicted of the murder. 'To have somebody in our life who was more concrete, more permanent, was great,' Alexa said. 'When our mom was telling us... this is the man you should love, it messed with our minds.' The twins, who have now made a documentary about their lives, were at their father's house in Manhattan when the 52-year-old was bludgeoned to death in the bedroom of his Hamptons home. Their aunt told them that their father had been killed, and their mother later added that he 'had killed himself with pills of some sort', Greg told Katie. 'Everything was so crazy that for the longest time I thought he wasn't even dead,' Alexa said. 'I thought he faked his own death.' Divided: The couple separated and were locked in a bitter custody battle at the time of Ammon's death . Missed: Alexa said her mother turned them against her father, which she regretted for years after his death . Scene: In a new documentary about their lives, Greg stands in the room where his father was killed . The children were left without parents for a second time when Generosa was diagnosed with breast cancer and died in August 2003. The children went to live with their aunt in Alabama. Pelosi, who had been battling for a . part of the fortune left by his late wife, was eventually arrested in . March 2004 and was found guilty of murder. He has maintained that Generosa hired a hit man to kill her husband. He will not be eligible for parole until 2031. But the twins admit they were not convinced he was a killer until he was convicted. 'I still had doubts up until that point,' Alexa said. 'I was so convinced he was innocent. I don't know what he did to my mind. He's a psychopath. Both Alexa and Greg are now certain he was to blame, and say they choose to believe their mother was not a part of their father's death. Killer: Daniel Pelosi was arrested for the murder in 2004 and will not be eligible for parole until 2031. He married Generosa Ammon three months after the death of her husband . Despite enduring such tragedy before they were teenagers, the twins pulled through. 'We had each other so that was one thing,' Greg said. 'It was not easy.' Greg eventually moved to Los Angeles . and started a film production company while Alexa managed a band in . South Carolina - but came back together to film the documentary for . closure. The twins, who inherited $1 . million each after taxes and attorneys' fees, also decided to use the . opportunity of the documentary to find their biological family in the Ukraine. Searching . through documents at the mansion, they find papers leading them to the . orphanage from where they were adopted as malnourished . children. They learn that . they were the result of a one-night tryst between their mother and a . soldier. The government then took them from their mother as she . struggled with alcoholism and mental problems. Thankful: Greg and Alexa Ammon, 22, have made a documentary revealing the torment they suffered after the murder of their father by their mother's lover in 2001 - but said the family saved them . Old life: In the film, they return to the Ukrainian orphanage and say they'd have died if they were not adopted . She was also a prostitute, who begged for money on the streets to buy alcohol. She died in 2004 and left behind a total of eight children, some of whom went to the same orphanage as the twins. The documentary shows them meeting their three half siblings and speaking to another brother on the phone in Moscow. Despite being adopted into a life of bitter custody disputes and murderous affairs, they are thankful to the Ammons for taking them in - otherwise they would have died in the orphanage. Alexa told Katie Couric how she had tuberculosis, which was not treatable in the Ukraine. 'Our parents saved us,' Greg said. 'Alexa would not be here if it was not for mom and dad.' 'They literally gave us life,' his sister added. 'It's an amazing thing.' See below for video of documentary trailer .","Greg and Alexa Ammon adopted from Ukrainian orphanage by U.S. couple .

A Minnesota woman's newborn son was . mistakenly given to the wrong mother, who breastfed the infant before . doctors discovered the mixup, it has emerged. Both mothers and the baby had to . undergo blood testing for hepatitis and HIV, diseases that can be . transmitted through breastfeeding, after the incident at Abbott . Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis. Tammy Van Dyke, the woman whose baby was given to a stranger, said she had left her son Cody in the nursery overnight as she attempted to get some rest - but wishes she never had. She awoke the next morning to find two . people in her hospital room to tell her that Cody had been placed in the . wrong bassinet in the nursery and given to another woman to breastfeed. Scroll down for video . Fears: Tammy Van Dyke holds her newborn son Cody, who was given to a different woman to breastfeed . 'When the woman was breastfeeding my son she felt like something . was wrong,' Tammy told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. 'And she looked at the ID band on his ankle and realised . that she had the wrong child, that she had my son.' The woman immediately hit the nurse button and summoned her back to the room to take the baby away. Tammy struggled to contain her tears as branded the mistake an 'oversight' by the nurse, who had failed to compare the child's identification wrist band against the mother's. 'My advice would be - and I'm sure this is a rare occurrence and never happens - is don't put your baby in the nursery because you don't know what could happen,' she said. Mixup: The other mother noticed something was wrong when she started breastfeeding Cody . Horrifying: She checked the baby's identification tag and discovered the boy was not her child . 'You think you're going to get your baby back and you might not. I'm very lucky that I did get him back and everything was OK.' The hospital issued Van Dyke a letter . of apology and an admission of negligence, which stated that the babies . were accidentally placed in the wrong bassinets in the hospital . nursery. Abbott places . matching wristbands on every newborn and its mother to prevent mixups . such as this one, according to hospital officials. 'While . hospital procedures require staff to match codes on the infant’s and . mother’s identification bands in order to prevent incidents like this, . it appears these procedures were not followed in this case,' Abbott . hospital said in a statement. The . hospital is investigating the matter to try and find out what went . wrong and how the wrong baby was placed in a mother's hands. 'As far as we know, this has never happened before at Abbott,' Gloria O'Connell, a spokeswoman for the hospital, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. 'Apparently, somebody didn't follow . procedure, so that's what we're trying to figure out,' she said. 'And . there will be consequences.' Scene: The Minneapolis hospital issued an apology and said the wrist bands had not been checked, as is policy . Abbott isn't the first hospital to mistakenly switch babies at birth. In March, a similar mistake occurred at Virginia Regional Medical Center, where a newborn was brought to the wrong mother and, like at Abbott, breastfed by the stranger before doctors discovered the mistake. The hospital installed a new digital baby-mother matching system following the mix-up to ensure that it wouldn't happen again. It's unclear whether Abbott is planning similar systematic changes to its baby-mother matching system. Relief: Tammy said she feels lucky that nothing worse happened to her son after the 'oversight' 'On behalf of Abbott Northwestern, I . am very sorry this incident occurred,' said Penny Wheeler, a practicing . obstetrician and Chief Clinical Officer of Allina Health, which owns .

Thousands of images seized from the home of Susan Powell's father-in-law show the missing Utah mother as she walks in public and sits in her car - apparently unaware that someone is taking her picture. The photos - some of which are sexually suggestive - were obtained under public records laws Thursday by The Associated Press, and revealed on Thursday - three years to the day after Mrs Powell went missing. Authorities uncovered the files while serving a search warrant last year at the home where her husband, Josh Powell, and father-in-law, Steven Powell, were living. Images: Thousands of pictures seized from the home of Susan Powell's father-in-law show the missing Utah mother as she walks in public and sits in her car - apparently unaware that someone is taking her picture . Father and son: The files were uncovered in a home shared by Steven Powell, pictured right, and his son Josh, pictured left . Josh Powell killed himself and the couple's two young children earlier this year. Some of the images seized during the search, including those of bathing young girls who lived next door to Steven Powell, were used earlier this year to convict him of voyeurism charges. Other photos show a variety of women, apparently unaware that a camera is focused on them, as they walk along sidewalks, at the park or into the mall. Convicted: Steven Powell was found guilty of voyeurism and child porn charges in September . Steven Powell was not charged with any crimes related to images of Susan Powell, but the files show she was often the focus of his lens. In a folder labeled with her initials, SMP, there are images of her walking through parking lots or sitting in her car. It appears the photographer is taking the pictures from another vehicle. Some images zoom closely to Susan Powell's crotch or her backside, including a set of photos taken through blinds as she's bending over and doing laundry. None of the pictures, which were found on a disc in Steven Powell's bedroom, show her naked. The folder dedicated to Susan Powell contains nearly 4,500 images. In journals that authorities have also made public, Powell describes himself as a 'voyeur' and Susan as an 'exhibitionist.' He talks about using a mirror to spy on her under the bathroom door, and he writes about taking sexual pleasure in looking at images of Susan Powell that he kept on his computer. Powell talks in his journals about taking lots of video of Susan during a trip to Silver Falls in 2009, and a folder of images from the trip shows only photos of her backside as she's walking. In one entry, dated a few months before Susan Powell disappeared, Steven Powell wrote that he had just woken up 'from a most pleasant dream about Susan.' He described a sexually charged dream in which Susan asked him, 'Do you think I would make a good wife for you?' Anne Bremner, an attorney who represents Susan Powell's parents, said the images support the family's assertion that Steven Powell had a concerning attraction for his daughter-in-law. Mother: Mrs Powell, pictured with her sons Charlie and Braden, has not been seen in three years . 'When you look at those pictures, it's clearly surreptitious. It's clearly obsessive,' Bremner said. The family believes Steven Powell knows something about Susan Powell's disappearance, and authorities have described him as uncooperative. Mark Quigley, an attorney who represented Steven Powell in the voyeurism case, did not return a call seeking comment. Powell is in prison, serving a sentence of more than two years. Susan Powell disappeared in Utah in December 2009. Records have shown that Utah investigators handling the case focused their attention primarily on her husband.

Star player: Sam Gordon, center left, pictured in action has earned teh nickname 'Sweet Feet' from her teammates after becoming one of the fastest kids the Salt Lake City 'Gremlins' league had ever seen . Remember the name: Sam Gordon's coach Chris Staib say the 9-year-old - who doesn't even weigh 60lbs - can 'cut and follow blocks like a college football player' Weighing not even 4.5st (27kg), Sam is playing in a team of much bigger boys including a boy who weighs more than 10st 9lbs (68kg)  and nicknamed Tank but according to Mr Staib, Sam will even tackle Tank if she gets the chance. Despite being so much smaller than all the other players, Mr Gordon said Sam is used to playing rough. He said from his office in Idaho: ‘I started her out in soccer at four-years-old and we would play out in the yard and my son's friends were pretty aggressive and rough. ‘She could really handle a lot of the physical play.

Mr Gordon said that Sam told her: ‘Some kids, right before the contact, they stop. ‘I don't. I just hit 'em.’ He said: ‘That's not something I taught her.’ Mr Gordon said it took her some time to adjust when she first started playing. He said: ‘She had a little bit of a struggle. ‘The team lost a couple of games. Since she was the primary ball carrier, she felt a lot of pressure to win.

'Psycho': Kiaran Stapleton, 21, was convicted of the murder of Indian student Anuj Bidve, 23, and last week tried to take his prison chaplain hostage . A self-proclaimed 'psycho' killer who laughed as he shot a stranger in the head has tried to take his prison chaplain hostage after his appeal against a life sentence failed. Kiaran Stapleton, who bragged 'I can do 30 years standing on my head', wanted to seek revenge in an attack at Full Sutton prison near York. In October Stapleton pleaded to have his jail term reduced, despite saying he whiles away his days in 'the best cell on the wing' waiting for his favourite soaps to begin while stuffing himself with sweets. In a letter dripping with misspellings he wrote: 'I sit in my cell waiting for Emmerdale and Coronation St and Eastenders eating pure chocolate and other s***. 'Have got the best cell on the wing and nare 30 isent (sic) that long I dont think enyway. I can do it standing on my head ""ha""'. Last week the 21-year-old lured in the chaplain by saying he wanted to speak privately to come to terms with his appeal being thrown out. But once they were alone he pulled a homemade weapon on the vicar, who managed to bring in help by pressing his panic button. A  team of guards then wrestled Stapleton to the ground and disarmed him, while the chaplain escaped unharmed in an attack about a week ago. A Prison Service spokesperson told MailOnline: 'On 30 November, a Full Sutton prisoner attempted to assault a member of the chaplaincy during worship.  The police have been notified.' Stapleton was found guilty of murder in July for killing Anuj Bidve, 23, in 'a piece of cold-blooded controlled aggression' that shocked Britain. Police have never established a motive for the attack by Stapleton, then 19. Attack: Stapleton pulled a homemade weapon on the innocent vicar just because his 30-year jail term was not reduced . Bidve had arrived in the UK to study micro-electronics at Lancaster University and was visiting Manchester with a group of friends last Christmas. Tragic: Indian student Anuj Bidve 23-year-old was gunned down on Boxing Day as he walked with a group of friends in Salford . They left their hotel in Salford to queue early for the sales when their paths crossed with Stapleton’s. He calmly walked across the road and repeatedly asked for the time. When someone finally answered he pulled a handgun out of his pocket and fired one shot to Mr Bidve’s left temple. Stapleton told one psychologist in prison that he picked out his victim because 'he had the biggest head', the jury heard. The day after the murder he booked into a hotel which overlooked the crime scene in Ordsall Lane and then later went to a tattoo parlour and had a teardrop design placed below his right eye - a symbol used by some gangs to mark that the wearer has killed someone. But after officers revealed CCTV footage of him close to the scene and trying to burn his clothes in his back garden, he tried to blame a friend, before eventually admitting the manslaughter of Mr Bidve on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He claimed he had a personality disorder which affected his self-control. Sentencing him in July, Mr Justice King told Stapleton: 'In my judgment, this was no impulsive act on your part. It was a piece of cold-blooded controlled aggression.' He said he had showed a 'most callous disregard' in laughing and smirking after he gunned down Mr Bidve and also during the trial.

London 2012 was a success for British Taekwondo, with Jade Jones' gold in the women's 57kg category adding to Muhammad's bronze. Anguish: Cook believes the World Taekwondo Federation will open up a path where selection is based on rankings rather than on discretion . Cook had won European Championships gold in May - Muhammad also won gold in the under-87kg event - and battled for a spot in the squad, but . British Taekwondo's decision was eventually ratified by the British . Olympic Association (BOA) and he missed out. Cook told Sky Sports News: 'I was reigning European champion, world number one - I am never going to work with those people [British Taekwondo] again. 'They have made their minds up with what they have done to me and I've made my mind up.' 'I think I am quite lucky at the moment,' added Cook . 'The WTF are looking to organise new competitions, such as a grand prix, which they have said will open up a different path to the Olympics based on world rankings. 'So all I have got to do is go and win the World Championships, the European Championships and make sure I am top ranked in the world and I can get there off my own back which we didn't have in the past.' Of his disappointment on having to . look on rather than participate in the summer, Cook added: 'I am . extremely jealous obviously, I wish that was me. 'She [Jade Jones] did fantastic and so did Lutalo and so did Martin Stamper. 'I just wish I could have been on that team, I felt I deserved to be on that team. 'I've got to find some peace and I've to go move forward and this Isle of Man [opportunity] has come up and I can't wait to be hopefully world champion next year.' Jealous: Cook said he was 'extremely jealous' of missing out on the Olympic squad.

A woman has been banned from getting behind the wheel after causing chaos at a McDonald's drive-thru by drunkenly driving the wrong way around it. Katie Howe, 22, was twice the legal alcohol limit when she tried to enter through the exit, Newton Aycliffe Magistrates' Court heard. Howe, of Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, pleaded guilty to drink driving and was banned for 20 months and . fined £110, with a £20 victim surcharge. The court heard how she damaged two other cars as she pulled her Vauxhall Corsa into the McDonald's restaurant at Coatham Mundeville, near Darlington, County Durham, on November 17. John Garside, prosecuting, described how she tried to go into the drive-thru section the wrong way. He said her actions meant that two cars, who were trying to use the facility properly, had to reverse rapidly and were damaged. Howe's car was not damaged in the incident. Police . were called to the scene and Howe gave a breath test reading of 73mg of . alcohol in 100ml of breath. The legal limit is 35m. Up to four in five motorists risk . exceeding the drink-drive limit by miscalculating the alcoholic content . of pub measures, a recent study revealed. Some 80 per cent underestimate the unit content in a pint of lager and 55 per cent get it wrong on a large glass of wine. Carole Whittingham, national secretary of the Campaign .

A school teacher has been blasted by furious parents after he told junior school pupils that Santa Claus did not exist as they wrote their letters to him. The teacher was taking a literacy lesson which involved the children, aged eight and nine, writing a letter to Father Christmas. During the class he told the youngsters that the man bringing them presents just wasn't real - and the Year Four pupils were left devastated. Dispelling the myth: Eight and nine-year-old pupils at Christchurch Junior School in Dorset were writing letters to Santa when their teacher broke the news that he didn't exist, causing a stream of complaints . The school in Christchurch, Dorset, has now been met with a stream of complaints from furious parents. A parent of an eight-year-old child in the . class said: ‘I was fuming when I found out. I spoke to the teacher and . to the headteacher. 'The headteacher apologised, but the teacher seemed . shocked that people were complaining. ‘He told the children to put their hands over their ears if they did not want Christmas spoilt, so it was not accidental.' One parent, who asked not to be named, said: 'This teacher has upset all our children'. Headteacher Simon Adorian admitted that the teacher had made a mistake following what he described as an 'awkward exchange with pupils' after one of them quizzed him over Santa's existence. Speaking to Mail Online, he said: 'He responded clumsily and didn't do his best. 'He was asked whether he existed and responded in a way, and with a look, that gave them doubt.

A member of a smash-and-grab gang who smashed their way into top stores using high-powered motorbikes and sledgehammers is suing Scotland Yard - claiming he was injured in a police ambush. Dean Cole, 24, was part of the gang that targeted 46 stores in London's West End - including stores run by Apple, Christian Dior, Dolce & Gabbana and Jimmy Choo. Cole, from Holloway, North London, was riding a stolen high-speed . bike when police sprang an ambush in Mayfair in August last year. He was . rammed by an unmarked police vehicle after a raid on Chanel in Bond . Street, leaving him with a leg injury. He admitted at Southwark Crown Court to his part in the conspiracy to commit burglary but may be unfit to appear in the dock for sentencing on January 11 when the case comes up again, in the dock. Now he has instructed solicitors to . make a claim for compensation against Scotland Yard, alleging that the . police action caused his injury. A Scotland Yard spokesman said yesterday (FRI): 'We can confirm, as of late November 2012, the Metropolitan Police Service has been served with a claim form by solicitors who are representing Dean Cole. We await further details of that claim. 'As with all claims, once the full details have been received, then the Metropolitan Police Service will assess them. If a claim is without merit, we will defend it vigorousl . The gang's crime spree, organised by lovers Steve Dedman, 20, and Lizzie Andrews, 19, was only brought to an end when they attracted too much attention - robbing a boutique owned by designer Anya Hindmarch just days after her bags were used by Royal Wedding guests. Scotland Yard were forced to launch a major undercover operation to catch the gang involving stakeouts outside London stores lasting over 100 nights. The young thieves, convicted this week, have been compared with Fagin's gang of pickpockets in the Charles Dickens' classic story Oliver Twist. Four members of the gang were convicted of raiding 46 designer stores. Three others had earlier pleaded guilty to similar offences. Ringleader Steve Dedman, 20, of King's Cross, was one of two men found guilty of robbery. His girlfriend and Cole admitted conspiracy to burgle at an earlier hearing. Scroll down for video . Dedman, pictured left, was yesterday found . guilty of two counts of robbery and cleared of three. His girlfriend . Lizzy Andrews, 19, right, pleaded guilty to her part in the conspiracy . before the trial . The youthful thieves, who were well-trained and often knew exactly which items were the most valuable, drew comparisons with Fagin's gang of pickpockets in the Charles Dickens' classic Oliver Twist. They are estimated to have stolen up to £1million worth of goods during nearly 50 robberies last year. ‘The gang mainly, but not always, stole handbags or computer equipment,’ said prosecutor Tim Clark. ‘Their method, known and “smash and grab”, was dramatic but also amazingly efficient and quick.’ The . gang would arrive on the scene on up to four stolen motorbikes with two . people on each, often using the bikes to smash stores’ windows. Targeted: Fashion designer Anya Hindmarch had her boutique raided by the gang days after her handbags has been worn by guests at the Royal Wedding . They armed themselves with sledgehammers and crowbars for some raids, while other times they claimed to be carrying knives and one passer-by was warned off with a handgun. Mr . Clark said: ‘As the riders waited with the engines running on the . bikes, with them pointing away from the shop, the pillion passengers . would run into the store and seize valuable items before running back . and jumping onto the bikes.' They would then speed off through the streets of London jumping red lights and going the wrong direction down one-way roads to evade police. But the gang drew too much attention to . themselves after targeting a boutique owned by well-connected designer Anya . Hindmarch - days after bags were worn by guests at the Royal Wedding. Ms Hindmarch, a friend of David and Samantha Cameron, told The Times newspaper: 'They knew exactly what they were doing, they took all of our bestsellers and our most expensive pieces.' Scotland Yard launched an undercover police operation to bring down the thieves before they did any more damage to London's retail sector. When officers raided Dedman’s home he fled across rooftops but was tracked down several weeks later. In his home they discovered a cake decorated with a motorcyclist crafted from icing sugar, surrounded by handbags bearing the Louis Vuitton logo. The cake was complete with the words ‘Happy Birthday Steven’ around the edge. Southwark Crown Court heard the gang’s other targets included the flagship Apple Store in Covent Garden, as well as Hush Jewellers and a Dior outlet between April and October 2011. When police raided Steven Dedman's house house they found a cake depicting the scene of one of his ram raids . Grant McCarroll, left, and Daniel White, right, at Southwark Crown Court. McCarroll was found guilty of helping Dedman evade capture, while White was cleared of two counts of handling stolen goods . Fellow raiders Reece Jackson, 19, left, and Paul Fearn, 22, right, were also convicted. Fearn was one of six men who raided the Apple store, stealing 37 items totalling £49,893. Dedman, now 20, was found guilty of two counts of robbery and cleared of three. He had already pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary and admitted he was present at nine smash-and-grab raids last year. Fellow raiders Reece Jackson, 19, and Paul Fearn, 22, were also convicted alongside Grant McCarroll, 19, who was found guilty of helping Dedman evade capture for two weeks. Bradley White, 22, pleaded guilty to his part in the conspiracy before the trial . A fifth man, Daniel White, 19, was cleared by the jury of two counts of handling stolen goods from Dior and Hush Jewellers. Dedman’s girlfriend Lizzy Andrews 19, Bradley White, 22, and Dean Cole, 24, pleaded guilty to their part in the conspiracy before the trial. The gang will be sentenced together on January 11 next year. Judge Anthony Pitts told them: ‘I am not making any promises whatsoever. ‘I want to find out more about you before deciding what the appropriate sentences will be.’ A total of 46 raids were carried out between April and October last year, with nearly £1m-worth of merchandise stolen. ‘The bikes would then speed away. We . have evidence from CCTV, police helicopter footage, and eyewitnesses, . that these bikes would travel at very high speeds, up to 100mph, and go . through red lights to get away at speed’. During . one robbery at video agency Adjust Your Set, in Charlotte Mews, Soho, . on August 22, five raiders on three bikes broke into the shop and one . shouted at two security guards: ‘I’ve got a knife, get in the f***ing . corner.’ The gang escaped with a computer, a laptop, and three Apple monitors. When the gang struck at the offices of Overbury, near Tottenham Court Road, they caved in a glass door. Security guard Rachid Elkhamlichi confronted one of the robbers but he shouted: ‘Stand back, stand back or I’ll do you.’ Detectives probe the scene outside the Chanel store in Old Bond Street after the raid last year . The gang would arrive on the scene on up to four stolen motorbikes with two people on each, often using the bikes to smash the windows . Fearn was one of six men who raided the Apple store, stealing 37 items totalling £49,893. He was caught when officers discovered his abandoned moped outside Wyclif Court, Clerkenwell, central London, and found him hiding inside. He had a bag containing an iPad, a MacBook Air and two MacBook Pros. Bradley White and Cole were caught when undercover police rammed into their high-powered bike as they attempted to flee from a raid on Chanel, in Bond Street, and Cole suffered injuries to his leg. The judge heard Cole may still be unfit to appear in court for sentencing next month, and ordered a medical report to be delivered if he cannot be in the dock. Police discovered a photo on Andrews’ phone of a person holding a newspaper cutting about the raid at Anya Hindmarch's boutique. Dedman, of Wharton Street, Bloomsbury, central London, denied five counts of robbery and one count of possession of an imitation firearm. He was convicted of two counts of robbery, but cleared of three and found not guilty of possession of a firearm. Jackson, of Holly Park Estate, in Finsbury Park, north London, denied one count of robbery but was found guilty by the jury. Both have already pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary between April 1 and October 11, 2011, and Dedman has admitted conspiracy to possess criminal property. Fearn, of Turnpike House, Goswell Road, Clerkenwell, denied one count of burglary. McCarroll, of Drummond Way, Offord Road, Islington, north London, denied doing an act intended to pervert the course of public justice. Both were found guilty by the jury yesterday.

The Association of Train Operating Companies (Atoc) said the average increase on January 2 would be 3.9 per cent. But the Atoc was accused of trying to downplay the figures, after it was said many passengers would face much higher price hikes. And rail companies were accused of trying to 'bury bad news' as they sneaked out the details of the fare rises under the cover of the Virgin franchise fiasco. Passenger Focus said an off-peak return from London-Plymouth on First Great Western will rise from £103 to £111.50 (up 8.3 per cent) while from Birmingham-London on Chiltern will go up from £25 to £27.50 (up 10 per cent).

An Anytime return from London to Norwich on Greater Anglia will go up from £98.60 to £107.70 - up 9.2 per cent. Mr Smith said: 'It’s disappointing . that the restraint shown on season ticket prices has not been extended . to all Off-peak and Anytime fares. In the current economic climate, . already hard-pressed passengers who face these rises will feel the . pinch.’ Manuel Cortes, general secretary of . the TSSA union, said: ‘Not only do Atoc try to bury bad news by . announcing fare increases on the same day as the West Coast franchise . fiasco report, they then try to hide the massive hike in unregulated . off-peak fares - three times more than inflation.’ Mr Cortez added: ‘These increases are . normally announced in November but have been deliberately held back to . avoid another own-goal for the private industry which relies on £4 . billion of taxpayer subsidies every year.’ Passenger Focus said that although . the government announced that it would limit the rise in regulated fares in . England to the inflation figure plus one per cent -  rather than the 3 . per cent that was previously proposed -  train companies still have . flexibility to increase some fares beyond that. The level of increase on non-regulated fares, which include some off-peak trips, is entirely at the discretion of operators. This means some of these fares are likely to far exceed the 3.9 per cent average rise. Atoc chief executive Michael Roberts . said: ‘Fare rises are determined largely by Government policy, and the . Chancellor confirmed the Government's approach for next year in the . Autumn Statement. 'We know nobody likes paying more for . their journey, especially to go to work. But railway funding can only . come from the taxpayer or from the passenger, and the government's . policy remains that a bigger share must come from people who use the . train.’ Rail Minister Norman Baker said: 'We . are engaged in the biggest rail investment programme since the 19th . century and it is only right that the passenger, as well as the . taxpayer, contributes towards that.’ Passengers from the Kent stations of . Deal, Dover Priory and Ramsgate will see their season tickets rise 6.46% . to £4,940 on January 2. Other above-average rises include . Folkestone-London (up 5.98 per cent to £4,888), Canterbury-London (up . 5.9 per cent to £4,860) and Tonbridge-London (up 5.2 per cent) to . £3,796). All season tickets are classed as regulated fares where a 4.2 per cent average rise cap exists for January 2013. Hard-pressed passengers are likely to feel the squeeze as some routes are set to increase in price by as much as 10 per cent . Some season tickets are not rising as . much as 4.2 per cent, while others are on, or very close, to the . average. Others are higher. The cost of a season ticket from . Shenfield in Essex to London, for example, actually dips in price, from . £2,720 to £2,704, while an Ellesmere Port to Chester annual ticket is . rising only 2.3 per cent to £720. Among season ticket fares that are . rising by less than 4 per cent are Aylesbury-London (up 3.2 per cent), Cambridge-London .

Twin boys born 17 weeks premature have finally been allowed to go home from hospital after becoming one of the most premature sets to have survived in Britain. Little Harley Garthwaite has joined his twin brother Archie at the family home in Hartlepool, Cleveland, after spending almost six months at the University Hospital of North Tees in Stockton because his lungs were weaker than his brother’s. Their mother Hayley Kennedy, 20, and father Billy Garthwaite say they now feel ‘complete’ that their family has been reunited. Family 'complete': Twins Archie (left) and Harley (right) Garthwaite were born 17 weeks premature and now after Harley spent almost six months in hospital, they are together again at the family home . Harley has spent his life so far in the neo-natal ward while Archie was discharged from hospital in October, aged about four-months-old. Archie and Harley defied medical odds when they were born in the 23rd week of the pregnancy weighing just 1lb 4oz and 1lb 6oz each respectively, making them one of the most premature sets of twins in the country to survive such a premature birth. The precious pair clung to life despite both having holes in their tiny hearts. Archie underwent gruelling open heart surgery at just two-weeks-old with Harley following two weeks later. Medics also operated on both to correct bowel problems, performed laser treatment to stimulate their underdeveloped eyes and put them on ventilators and oxygen to help them to breathe. Little miracle: Harley has spent his life so far in a hospital neo-natal unit because his lungs were weaker than his brother's. The twins underwent open heart surgery among other procedures to defy the odds . They are still on oxygen and their parents have to keep a supply of gas canisters with them, even when they go out in the pram. Ms Kennedy said: ‘It was absolutely fabulous bringing him home. I cried. ‘It's just amazing to have them both together and we still can't believe we have them both after we thought we were going to lose them. ‘It was just so emotional leaving the hospital after everything the staff have done for them. We can't thank them enough. ‘But on the other hand we now feel like a proper little family and I feel like a proper mam. ‘I didn't feel like a proper mam when he was in hospital because I wasn't there for him 24/7. 'Thought we were going to lose them': The twins at home with mother Hayley Kennedy and father Billy Garthwaite who say that the boys now sleep much better now that they are back together . ‘We'd go to see him at the hospital for an hour or so and then have to go home. It was hard.’ Ms Kennedy said the brothers were so much more content now they have been reunited and both wake up at exactly the same times for feeds. The hairdresser said: ‘Archie sleeps so much better now Harley's home. He used to cry constantly, but now Harley's home he sleeps perfectly. ‘They both get up every night at 3am and 6am for their bottles. I feel as though they know they're together, definitely.’ The twins are getting bigger and stronger every day with Archie weighing 8lb 10oz and Harley 9lb 5oz. The couple met on Facebook in November last year and have been together 12 months. Recent research found that survival rates for babies born between 22 and 25 weeks have risen overall since 1995. The survival of extremely premature babies has also increased, but the proportion of survivors with major complications has not changed.","Harley and Archie Garthwaite were born in the 23rd week of the pregnancy .

Personal statements on university application forms should be scrapped because they are unfair to state school pupils, a study claimed today. The Sutton Trust education charity found state pupils are more likely to make writing errors and to struggle to draw on suitable work experience. Private school pupils are likelier to use ‘appropriate’ language in the 600-word texts and to describe prestigious job placements or other activities. Unfair: State school pupils were more likely to make errors in their personal statements, the study found . Half a million of the essays are penned every year by applicants seeking to sell themselves to their preferred universities. One private school pupil cited six high-status work placements including a stint on the trading floor of a top firm of stockbrokers and ‘most recently managing a small gastro pub’. In contrast, a state school pupil had written that ‘in the final GCSE year there was an opportunity for a group of us to manage the school lockers’. The study also warned of growing evidence that personal statements are ‘for sale’ and teenagers are paying up to £350 for statements written for them by graduates. The research, commissioned by the Sutton Trust education charity, called for the personal statement section of the UCAS application form to be radically overhauled to prevent pupils ‘exploiting school type advantages’. It said there was anecdotal evidence some pupils received so much help the statement could not be seen as their ‘own work’. Competition: More than half a million personal statements are penned every year by applicants eager to sell themselves to their chosen university . Applicants should be only be able to list a limited number of experiences - perhaps as few as one, the report said. Rather than allowing a ‘free response’, UCAS should consider inviting applicants to answer a specific question. Instead of simply listing their previous achievements, applicants should be asked to state which attributes they would bring to a course or university. Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, said: ‘Personal statements should be more than an excuse to highlight past advantages. ‘Applicants should outline how they might contribute to campus life, and universities should make it clear that applicants are not penalised for lacking opportunities in the past due to family circumstances.’ The study, by Dr Steven Jones, of Manchester University, analysed 309 personal statements written by teenagers with three Bs at A-levels who were applying to the same department of an elite university. He found that state school applicants appeared to receive less help in composing their statements and made three times more grammatical, spelling and punctuation errors. When discussing work experience, they were more likely to mention Saturday jobs such as waitressing at KFC or stacking shelves at Aldi rather than prestigious placements. University applicants should be allowed to outline how they might contribute to campus life, the study said . One private school applicant had talked of shadowing the Indian Ambassador to the United Nations. Privately-educated pupils were also more likely to cite working in family businesses. And when it came to listing hobbies and interests, the activities described by state school students tended to ‘carry little weight in the admissions process’, the study said. It highlighted examples of private school applicants citing cordon bleu cookery courses at Anton Mosimann’s school and skiing seasons at Meribel. But one state school applicant had written about following Manchester United, adding: ‘I regularly watch Match of the Day and I enjoy the diversity of the Champions League.’ Seventy per cent of the privately-educated applicants in the study ended up being accepted by an elite university, against just 50 per cent from comprehensives and colleges. The report called for state schools to give pupils better advice and guidance in drawing up their statements. It added: ‘UCAS should consider whether the personal statement, in its current form, is an appropriate and fair indicator of applicants’ potential.’ And it said: ‘A fairer structure for the personal statement might be one that allows one activity only to be listed.’ UCAS chief executive Mary Curnock Cook, said: ‘I have every confidence in the professionalism of admissions officers - they are highly experienced in recognising social factors in the content of personal statements. ‘The personal statement is one of a number of pieces of evidence that admissions staff look at when assessing an applicant’s potential to succeed in higher education.’","State school pupils more likely to make errors and to struggle with suitable work experience, study found .

Two men have become the first in Britain to be jailed for land banking fraud today after conning elderly and vulnerable people out of £3million. Omar Eshpari, 33, and Stefan Mitchell, 42, masterminded the deception, conning people into buying plots of land that were either worthless or massively over-priced. A string of fraudulent companies were set up and sold land bought cheaply across England or plots they did not even own. First in Britain: Omar Eshpari (left) and Stefan Mitchell (right) were jailed for seven and six years respectively for masterminding a £3million deception in a 'landmark moment' for police in the fight to prevent fraud . The locations were marketed as being in a prime position for development and would quickly increase in value. In reality, investors were putting their money into plots located on farmland, in the Green Belt, within an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty or on the sides of hills, with no chance of gaining planning permission let alone building houses. Some received small returns while others lost everything, with the duo funnelling off the funds into a network of bank accounts. Over a two-year period, more than 300 victims fell foul of the gang. Among the victims was an elderly man who was suffering from terminal cancer losing almost £300,000 and a retired woman who was conned out of £373,000. Eshpari, from Enfield, north London, and Mitchell, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, used virtual offices with London addresses and professionally-produced brochures and websites to legitimise their operation. Cold-calling and high-pressure sale tactics were put into play to target and then bully people into buying into their scheme. By late 2009, more and more investors were becoming concerned about the lack of returns from Pemberton International, Eldon International, Willow International, Allied Investment and Abacus Investment, and were increasingly asking for their money back. No profit: Prosecutor Luke Dockwray told Isleworth Crown Court (pictured) that 'only a miracle would produce a development opportunity, let alone a profit' from the land the men claimed to be selling . But following reports from numerous . victims and a detailed City of London Police investigation, working . closely with agencies including Companies Investigation Branch and the . Financial Services Authority, a series of arrests were made in October . 2009. Eshpari and Mitchell were jailed for seven and six years respectively at London's Isleworth Crown Court today. Commander Steve Head said: ‘The UK's first land banking fraud convictions is a landmark moment for all those committed to combating and preventing fraud, and sends out a clear message to the criminal community that law enforcement is wise to their new tricks and is taking decisive action.’ Detective constable David Parkinson, from the City of London Police, said: ‘Eshpari and Mitchell preyed on the vulnerable, exploiting their desire to put their savings in something tangible that would provide them with long-term security. ‘They cared not from whom they stole, but only for what they could take. High-pressure sale tactics: The men targeted and bullied people into buying into the scheme, convincing people into buying plots of farmland (stock picture) that were either worthless or massively over-priced . ‘Plots of land that were good for nothing and worth a fraction of the asking price were marketed as a sound investment with planning permissions in the pipeline and development round the corner. ‘The gang used all the tricks of the trade to give the appearance of legitimacy, picked off their targets over the phone and then disappeared without trace with their savings. ‘A complex and painstaking investigation by the City of London Police has ensured Eshpari and Mitchell have now been made to pay for the deception they created and the damage they caused.’ Luke Dockwray, prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service central fraud division, said: ‘Far from being ripe for development, one site in Halifax was on a 40-degree slope with Tree Preservation Orders and a Japanese Knotweed problem. ‘All the land consisted of undivided plots in fields; only a miracle would produce a development opportunity, let alone a profit.’ Land banking fraud has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, with fraudsters swapping shares in a company for plots of land as a way to entice people into making an investment. Victims are led to believe the land is ripe for development and can only go up in value. The reality is that it is worth a fraction of what it is being marketed at, or even nothing at all, and the people they have trusted with their savings are, in fact, highly-skilled criminals.","Omar Eshpari and Stefan Mitchell set up a string of fraudulent companies .

Simon Laxon has alkaptonuria, a highly rare genetic disease which often leads to a range of other conditions such as osteoarthritis, heart problems and kidney infections . A 46-year-old man is suffering with a million-to- one condition that gives him the body of a 90-year-old. Simon Laxon, from Coventry, was diagnosed at birth with alkaptonuria or AKU, a highly rare inherited genetic disease. He is one of only around 80 people in the UK known to have the condition, which often leads to a range of other debilitating conditions such as osteoarthritis, heart problems and kidney infections. The rare disease - which gets its name because it can turn urine a blackish purple colour - is an enzyme deficiency which sees acid attack bones and cartilage effectively aging them far faster than normal. The crippling pain caused by the condition has forced Mr Laxon to leave his job as a former brake systems engineer. The father-of-two said: ‘I feel like a 45-year-old in a 90-year-old’s body.' As the condition has progressed, leading to severe joint and back pain, the keen sportsman, with a black-belt in Kung Fu, has had to give up his hobbies. Despite knowing about his condition since he was a child, his symptoms only got worse in the last few years. ‘I suffered from AKU even as a baby as my mother would tell the doctors about seeing the black and purplish marks in my nappy.’ And despite then being told the condition was harmless, research has since shown it is linked to severe early onset osteoarthritis. It causes cartilage to become black and brittle and break away. Other symptoms include kidney and prostate stones created as the acid crystallises and heart problems due to calcification of blood vessels. Now, Mr Laxon has become one of the first people in Britain to undergo pioneering new medical treatment at a first-of-its-kind UK clinic. Now accepted on to a new trial using the drug nitisinone, Mr Laxon can live a more active life, pursuing his hobbies such as model-making . He is taking the drug nitisinone, a compound that started its life as a weed killer. It is currently used to treat hereditary Tyrosinemia type 1, a rare disease that leads to liver and kidney problems. It’s thought the drug may stem the acidic effect caused by the enzyme deficiency, preventing the bones from being attacked. Mr Laxon says the effects of the drug have been remarkable. ‘Since I went to the trial this summer I have been able to do so much more – even helping my wife with the DIY and decorating. ‘Not being able to work has been hard, as I was such an active person, doing kung fu and playing squash. I made brake pods and systems for tanks and cars. ‘It’s so liberating to be able to do the things I used to take for granted.’ He is expected to continue taking the drug for the foreseeable future. The AKU centre at the Bone and Joint Centre in Liverpool has already treated 13 other patients. Dr Lakshminarayan Ranganath, medical director of the AKU Society, told the Daily Express: ‘I believe nitisinone will effectively provide a cure. It won’t repair the genetic defect but it will block symptoms at an early age.’","Simon Laxon, from Coventry, has alkaptonuria, a highly rare genetic disease .

Carton faced a prison sentence unless her aristocratic lover could pay back the benefits bill - which he did after securing an advance from his trust fund, held by the Queen's bankers Coutts. A court heard Mr Wellesley, 39, picks up £30,000-a-year from trust funds set up for descendants of Arthur Wellesley, the first Duke of Wellington.

Mr Wellesley was true to his word - and paid the money over before Carton was due back in court yesterday. The court heard he secured an advance on his trust fund held by Coutts, the Queen's bankers, to pay back what she had taken. He can trace his ancestry back to the Duke of Wellington, has a handsome trust fund and owns a portfolio of properties. She has far humbler origins, eight children from a disastrous marriage, and is ten years his senior. But . Richard Wellesley, a great-great-great-great nephew of the famous Iron .

Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, set up a trust fund for his descendants including Richard Wellesley, his brother's great-great-great grandson . Mr . Wellesley’s great-great-great grandfather was a brother of the duke. Carton, who . appeared at Cardiff Crown Court walking with the aid of a crutch, had . pretended Mr Wellesley was her landlord and she paid rent to him. Council investigators became suspicious because utility and Sky TV . subscription bills were in his name at their address in the village of . Abersychan, near Pontypool, South Wales. Gareth James, prosecuting, said: 'After she was investigated by fraud . officers she admitted, ""He is a little more than a landlord"".'

All Australian children will learn an Asian language after Prime Minister Julia Gillard launched a visionary plan to help the country exploit the region's 'unstoppable' economic growth. In a move to ensure Australia are prepared for the 'Asian Century', Ms Gillard wants to improve links with the continent by committing to 25 ambitious goals over the next 13 years. All schoolchildren in the country will choose one of four ‘priority’ languages to learn at school – Indonesian, Japanese, Hindi and Chinese. Ambitious: Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard hopes that her plan to encourage all schoolchildren to speak an Asian language will improve financial links with the region . Australian schools will be partnered with Asian schools and television stations are being encouraged to air more Asian news and programmes to verse Australia's youth in knowledge of the booming region. The measures, outlined in a government report, also include offering thousands of scholarships to Asian students and will require a third of company directors to have a ‘deep’ working knowledge of the region, according to The Daily Telegraph. Ms Gillard said: ‘This is good news for Australia and it should drive a profound change in our thinking about our economic relationship with Asia.’ ‘Children in kindergarten now will graduate from high school with a sound working knowledge of Asia.’ Asia’s economy continues to grow, and Ms Gillard is looking for more ways to harness the financial prosperity to the advantage of Australia. Visionary: Many believe that Ms Gillard's plans are well-intentioned to improve links with areas such as Hong Kong but feel that they could have come too late . A mining boom had already been sparked by the perpetual Asian growth, yet there are growing fears that this could have peaked and may be on the decline. China’s economy in particular continues to go from strength to strength. Although the growth in Beijing was the slowest since 2009 in the three months in September, it remained at a remarkably high 7.4 per cent. Ms Gillard is not intending to lower wages to compete with the Asian workforce, but instead wants to promote tourism, education and agriculture to the growing middle classes, specifically in China. Ms Gillard added: ‘Think of it this way: back in the ‘80s Fosters beer tried to get into China. Today it is Grange [an expensive Australian wine] carrying the flag.’ Many have backed Ms Gillard’s plans, but have said they have come too late. Professor Andrew MacIntyre, from the Australian National University, told the Telegraph: ‘The scale of the change now is so huge. 'Australia has to adapt. We need to lift because the pace of change is not slowing down.’ Taking the plunge: Ms Gillard slipped and fell when she was visiting the Gandhi Memorial in New Delhi two weeks ago . Helped up: Ms Gillard was aided back to her feet after her heel was caught in the grass in India . Adrian Vickers, Asian Studies director at the University of Sydney, added: ‘The Asian century is already well underway. I think we have a lot of catching up to do. ‘The rapid advances in technology, in social change, in political change in Asia are things that we are struggling to keep up with as a nation.’ The British Council work to improve the opportunities for British schoolchildren to learn Chinese. They believe that as China is now the . world's second largest economy it is vital that Britain take similar . steps to Australia in encouraging young people to communicate in Asian . languages, particularly Mandarin. Martin Davidson, Chief Executive of . the British Council and fluent Chinese speaker, said: 'The UK’s future . prosperity depends in no small part on our ability to communicate, . interact and build relationships with people from around the world. Attention: Ms Gillard inspected a guard on honour at the Rashtrapati Bhavan in India, a country she wants to improve links with . 'With . China recently becoming the world’s second biggest economy – and set to . continue that upward trajectory – there are few more important partners . for us. 'A good understanding of Chinese . language and culture will give our young people the advantage they need . to live in a global society and compete in a global economy.' Two weeks ago Ms Gillard, while on a . state visit to India, got her heel caught in the grass and fell while . visiting the Gandhi Memorial in New Delhi. After the faux pas, as aides turned to help her up she told them: ‘I’m fine.

'The accusations have been made, the police have to look at it, that's what they have to do. 'I have to answer their questions and hopefully show clearly and conclusively to them and everybody else that there's absolutely no truth in any of this.' The publicist said that one allegations dates back to 1977, and another to a few years afterwards. He was bailed to appear at a date later this month. Leaving Belgravia police station in . central London last night, he said: 'These allegations are damaging and . totally untrue.

Asked when the allegations dated from, he replied: '1977, 35 years.’ He later confirmed there were two allegations, although it is not known whether they relate to two different people. Sources close to Clifford said he was confident he had nothing to worry about. He is the fifth suspect to be arrested – and sixth person to be questioned – in connection with Operation Yewtree, the police inquiry set up after late Top Of The Pops presenter Savile was exposed as a serial abuser. There are three strands to the Yewtree . operation – two involving Savile, and a third termed ‘Others’. Clifford . falls into this third category, meaning he was not being questioned . about anything connected to Savile. He was arrested in a low-key . operation at 7.40am, when two unmarked police cars and two white transit . vans arrived at his three-storey home on an exclusive gated estate in . the Surrey stockbroker belt. Held on suspicion of sexual offences, Clifford said the allegations date back to 1977 . British publicist Max Clifford walks out of a police station in central London on Thursday evening after being released on bail . Later, officers could be seen putting black bags believed to contain items from his house into the back of the vans, while flashes at the large windows suggested officers were taking photographs inside. A neighbour who saw the cars arrive said: ‘The arrest has come as a massive shock, as he is well respected in the community. The allegations are totally out of character.’ Clifford has been a vocal commentator on the Savile scandal, and last month said a lot of old stars were worried about being dragged into the investigation because they had appeared on Top Of The Pops or Jim’ll Fix It and had merely posed for photographs with girls and Savile. Max Clifford, seen with two of his former clients Rebecca Loos (left) and Vanessa Perroncel (right). There is no suggestion that any of his clients are in any way involved with the case . Former clients include: . Reality TV star Rebecca Loos . Former Harrods' owner Mohamad Al-Fayed . Singer Cheryl Cole . Late reality star Jade Goody . Music mogul Simon Cowell .

"By . Kate Bevan . PUBLISHED: . 08:20 EST, 5 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:28 EST, 5 December 2012 . Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg: his website now has more than a billion users, who are being asked to vote on a series of changes that the internet giant insists are 'housekeeping' ahead of new product launches . Facebook's one billion users are voting on changes to the internet giant's policy. If you haven't already voted, you have until next Monday evening to register your views. But if 30 per cent of users don't vote, all users will lose the ability to vote on any future changes. Of those who have already voted, most are against the proposed changes. Eliott Schrage, vice-president of communications, public policy and marketing, explained in a long post what the changes would mean. The main changes are to the way Facebook can share your data with its partners, including the popular picture-sharing app, Instagram. Facebook bought Instagram for about $1billion (£621million) in April. Facebook wants to be able to make changes to how it stores and shares information - including Likes and comments - with advertisers and anyone else it is affiliated with. What worries privacy campaigners is the note from Facebook that this information can include your views on sensitive issues such as health, religion or politics. However, the site's guidelines make clear that advertisers are prevented from 'running ads that assert or imply sensitive personal characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation'. Facebook also wants to end the process by which users can vote on changes. That is because of the explosive growth of the social networking platform. When the system was launched, asking for 7,000 comments in a week on a change seemed reasonable. Now, that threshold is easily reached, but getting 30 per cent of the users - more than 300million people - to vote is much less likely. On previous occasions, voter turnout among users has nowhere near reached the level required. In June, just 342,632 people participated in a vote on data use policy, while in April 2009, 665,654 votes were cast on a proposal at a time when the site had around 200million users. That means noisy minority voices can have too much influence over Facebook policy. Mobile advertising is an important move for Facebook as more users check in using their smartphones than their desktop computers . Schrage said 'Our goal in modifying our site governance process is to make sure that we receive feedback from you in the best, most productive way possible.' Facebook also wants to change your ability to limit who can send you private messages. That could mean spam from advertisers in your inbox. Facebook said it couldn't comment on upcoming changes to the product. Campaigners are urging Facebook users to vote to keep the existing documents. Doing so would prevent the changes from going through. However, a Facebook spokesman warned that many of the changes covered in the new documents come from its regulator in Ireland. He said: 'If those could then be vetoed by the vote.. where would that leave us? In violation of data protection laws. 'The changes are more than just a nice to have. 'We need to make them to stay compliant.' After its lacklustre stock market float, Facebook has been keen to build its mobile advertising presence. Until recently, those viewing the site via apps on their smartphones or tablets were seeing fewer ads, despite the fact that more posts were being made via mobile apps than from desktop computers. The internet firm's third-quarter earnings showed that advertising revenues grew by 36 per cent on the same time last year to reach $1.08billion. Of that - $139million - came from adverts shown on mobile devices. A Facebook spokesman stressed that the changes the internet giant wants to make are 'housekeeping' changes to prepare the way for new products to launch.","30% of users - more than 300 million users - must vote to have effect .

A Marine already in custody in the theft of an assault weapon was booked Tuesday on suspicion of murder in the death of another Marine's wife, authorities said. The latest allegation against Louis Ray Perez came a week after the body of 22-year-old Brittany Killgore was found in brush near a Southern California lake. Sheriff's investigators identified the 45-year-old Perez as a person of interest shortly after the body was discovered. The San Diego County district attorney's office said the case was under review. Scroll down for videos . Alternative lifestyle: Louis Perez, a persona of interest in the murder of Brittany Killgore, posted several photographs like these on a kinky sex website . Master and slave: Perez's girlfriend, seen here with her face blurred, said she had 'two slave girls' Another suspect, Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, pleaded not guilty to murder last week in Killgore's death. She is being held on $3 million bail. Authorities have not said whether Lopez and Perez knew each other or whether they knew the victim. Jeff Reichert, Perez's attorney, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Perez has been in the military for 16 years, has no criminal history, is married and has lived in the San Diego area for about 10 years, Reichert said in court last week. He is being held on $500,000 bail in Vista, north of San Diego. Only hours earlier, a 'person of interest' in the murder of marine's wife Brittany Kilgore left a series of bizarre postings on a depraved BDSM sex website. Perez, 47, who is also a Marine, used to live in Fallbrook, California, with his girlfriend and made posts on the website BMEHookups.com about wanting to find another 'sex slave' to join his home. Jessica Lynn Lopez, who has been charged with murder in Mrs Killgore's death, currently lives with Perez's girlfriend. The families of both Mrs Killgore, 22, and Lopez, 25, both vehemently deny that the two were linked with Perez's sex ring. Internet outlet: Perez's girlfriend posted several messages on the website TSRnetwork.com . However, in a posting on another BDSM website, TSRnetwork.com, Perez's girlfriend wrote: 'We have a poly home in which I own two slave girls. Life is good,' the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Poly refers to 'polyamorous,' an alternative 'open' relationship style with multiple sexual partners. Authorities have not said what led Lopez to allegedly kill Mrs Killgore and Perez has not been formally implicated in her death. Perez is currently in jail after he was arrested for possessing an assault rifle stolen from nearby Camp Pendleton, where he had served for 10 years. He is not cooperating with police, the Union-Tribune reports. On BME Hookups, a website devoted to matching connecting people with kinky sex fetishes, Perez, who used the online alias 'Ivan' wrote: 'I am lord and master, dom and daddy of my house. My slave, Ms. Dee, is a slave to no one, but myself.' His 36-year-old girlfriend described herself as 'an alpha slave to master Ivan.' Perez posted several photos of himself and his girlfriend on the website and said he was looking for another woman to join his home. Mrs Killgore was married to Cory Killgore, a Marine who was recently deployed overseas to Afghanistan. Mrs Killgore, it was revealed, maintained a blog years ago where she wrote about fears about marriage and divorce. In the blog titled 13smyfavoritenumber, Killgore, whose nude body was discovered on Tuesday, wrote about her insecurities and how she suffered from depression, according to NBC San Diego. ‘im so insecure sometimes its not even funny (sic),’ she wrote aged 17, adding that she had recently stopped taking anti-depressants. Tragic: The body of Brittany Killgore was discovered on Tuesday, four days after she was last seen with a marine who was later arrested on an unrelated charge . Suspect: Authorities believe that the victim knew Jessica Lynn Lopez (pictured here), and the two were involved in some kind of sex slave ring . She also told how she was worried . about getting married because of the high divorce rates. Tragically, . Killgore had filed for divorce from her Marine husband Cory Killgore the . week before she went missing. When responding to a question about . whether she wanted to get married, Killgore wrote in 2007: ‘i want to . be, but … i want to love that person. the divorce rate is so high its . sad.’ In other postings, Killgore revealed . she did not get on with her family and was looking forward to moving out . and going to college. ‘im planning to move out its very . difficult. i dont get along with my family all that well i think it will . be better when i move out. my sister and i have gotten closer though, . its actully realy weird,’ she said . The blog comes to light as the woman accused of killing the young wife pleaded not guilty to murder charges on Thursday. Prosecutors offered no details of the . motive Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, had to allegedly harm Killgore, whose . body was discovered in brush near a lake in San Diego, California. Suicide attempt: Jessica Lynn Lopez was found with numerous self-inflicted stab wounds on her body at this Ramada Inn near the San Diego Airport .

Within hours of . finding Lopez, searchers discovered the body of Killgore. Bail for Lopez was set at $3 million at her arraignment in Vista Superior Court, north of San Diego. Lopez's . attorney Dean Broyles said he didn't know if his client knew Perez or . Mrs Killgore, who was reported missing Saturday -- one day after Lopez . turned 25. 'There's a lot of speculation, a lot of innuendo, a lot of weak allegations and charges out there,' he said. Missing: Brittany Killgore lived in Fallbrook, California, not far from Camp Pendleton . 'I would caution everyone to not jump to conclusions and prejudge based on all the information flying around right now.' Mr . Broyles said Lopez would ask the judge for a public defender after her . family sought his help in fielding media questions. Lopez's parents, who . live in nearby Escondido, released a statement saying they loved their . daughter. 'We pray for the . family of Brittany Killgore and ask that the Lord comfort them during . their time of grief and anguish,' the parents said. 'We ask that you pray for all of those impacted by this tragic situation, including our family.' Authorities have not disclosed Mrs Killgore, Lopez, and Perez are connected. A neighbour, who declined to be identified, told ABC 10 that both Lopez and the victim took part in some kind of sex ring, saying: 'They're into the sex slave things... I try not to judge, but that's what they're into.' Perez, 45, pleaded not guilty . on Wednesday to stealing a AR-15 rifle from Camp Pendleton. Investigators have given few . details about that case, and it was not known if they suspect the weapon . was tied to Killgore's death. Perez was being held on $500,000 . bond.

"By . Liz Thomas and Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 11:32 EST, 26 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:46 EST, 27 June 2012 . John Simpson has revealed he would commit suicide if old age were to leave him incapacitated. The 67-year-old veteran broadcaster said he would rather end his life than become a ‘gibbering wreck’ who is totally reliant on his wife or carer to manage basic functions. Speaking at the launch of the BBC1 documentary When I Get Older, part of the When I’m 65 series that broadcasts next week, he said: ‘I’m working out new ways to make sure I don’t end up... utterly dependent on somebody whose life I’m [making difficult].’ Earlier this week, the BBC World Affairs editor had hailed 65 as ‘the new 55’. But in his latest comments, he said although he is less worried about getting older and dying he wanted to do it on his own terms. Happy couple: John Simpson and his wife Dee. But the BBC broadcaster has said he would rather commit suicide than allow her and his son to see him as a 'gibbering wreck' Simpson, who became a father again at . the age of 61, explained: ‘I’m not advocating [euthanasia] for anyone . else. But in my own case, I don’t want my own six-year-old son to have . his main memories of me as a gibbering, sad old wreck. I’d rather take . the early way out, rather than to hang on purely for the sake of being . alive.’ The veteran war reporter also admitted he was less worried about getting older and dying after making the programme but wanted to do it on his own terms. He insisted he was not campaigning for assisted death but felt he personally would prefer to die and leave his family positive memories of a healthy and capable man, than be left alive but unable to function. The BBC World Affairs correspondent married South African Ms Kruger – who is 19 years his junior and was formerly his producer - in 1996. He became a father again at 61. Day job: John Simpson reporting in the field for the BBC on in Northern Iraq. He is taking part in a new series on growing old . But pro-life campaigners have expressed their concern. A spokesman for Care Not Killing said it was 'unhelpful' that death was presented as a solution. He said: ‘This is a deeply sad statement from a well-respected BBC figure. These kind of beliefs are motivated by a fear of getting older in this country. ‘What we are campaigning for is that older people get better quality care and good palliative care if they are sick.’ In the programme Simpson, presenter Gloria Hunniford, actress Lesley Joseph, and comedian Tony Robinson, all spend time with elderly individuals and are tasked with encouraging older people to become more active. Battle: Much-loved author Sir Terry Pratchett has Alzheimer's disease and is for assisted dying . He added that his research for the programme, which also spends time in a care home for those suffering with Alzheimers’ Disease, had made him feel 'less frightened' about getting old and dying. The BBC World Affairs correspondent explained: ‘If only you have the ability and the freedom to manage the way you live, I now realise, even your last days can be spent in peace and harmony.' Robinson was brutal in his appraisal of UK care homes and said Britons needed to change their attitude towards the elderly. He said: ‘I think care homes are prisons that people are sent to as a punishment for being old. The problem for me having spent time in one is that every moment is being prescribed. ‘In 150 years I hope people will look back on the way we treat the elderly now with the same kind of horror as child labour.’ Life expectancy in Britain is now 78.2 years for a man and 82.3 years for a woman but the Office of National Statistics believe by 2030 it both sexes will live, on average, to the age of 87. In Britain, women have a 50 per cent chance of being a carer by the time they are 59. Robinson said that families are being exploited because the Government has failed to come up with a viable solution for people nursing their loved ones. He said: ‘There needs to be more support for carers. We consign the people that love [the elderly and infirm] most, to poverty and the most horrendous life because they are the person that will be there and care. ‘The modern way is that when people are 65 we eject them from society and isolate them by putting them in homes. There is going to have to be societal change.’ Robinson’s comments echo the views of acclaimed author Sir Terry Pratchett who he revealed he was battling Alzheimer’s Disease In 2007, aged just 57 and has campaigned for better care for sufferers. Project: Mr Simpson is one of several big BBC stars taking part in the season of programmes . Earlier this year, he accused the Government of making dementia sufferers feel like ‘malingerers’ who don’t have a proper disease. He said it was unfair that families were ‘bankrupting’ themselves paying for dementia care when treatment for other conditions is free on the NHS. In 2011, the writer made controversial documentary Terry Pratchett: Choosing to Die, which broadcast on the BBC and led to accusations the broadcaster was acting as a “cheerleader for assisted death”. Almost 900 viewers made formal complaints to the corporation about the programme, which filmed the death of motor neurone sufferer Peter Smedley, while just 82 contacted the broadcaster to praise it. Four senior Peers accused the BBC of running a 'repugnant' and 'disgraceful' 'orchestrated campaign' to change the law on assisted death. Religious leaders, charities, and politicians also joined the chorus of criticism the accusing the BBC2 documentary of being ‘one-sided’ and ‘propaganda’ for euthanasia. Opposition to assisted death has been based on grounds of public safety and this is reflected in the views of the organisations representing disabled people as well as the British Medical Association and Royal Colleges which do not wish to see doctors and nurses required to take the lives of their patients. The BBC is broadcasting a week of programmes about old age as part of its When I am 65 season, which begins on July 4.","'I’m already working on ways of ensuring that I don’t end up dependent on .

"By . James Slack, Home Affairs Editor . PUBLISHED: . 19:04 EST, 26 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:38 EST, 27 November 2012 . llegal immigrants must be given free treatment by GPs, under a hugely controversial edict handed down by NHS managers. The doctors will be paid £64 a year for each migrant they put on their books – the same amount they receive for all new patients. The guidance, which was slipped out in July, states that an overseas visitor can register with a doctor provided they are in the area for more than 24 hours. A GP’s appointment cannot be withheld on the grounds that the patient does not have personal identification or proof of residence. Guidance: GPs have been told they must give illegal immigrants free treatment (file picture) The instruction also says that past or present payment of taxes or National Insurance is not to be taken into account. Last night, Whitehall sources said Jeremy Hunt was ‘concerned’ by the edict, which was issued before he became Health Secretary in September. Officials said a review of the rules is under way to see if they need to be tightened. Two senior MPs have also written to the Prime Minister demanding the instruction – designed to protect the human rights of foreign visitors – be withdrawn immediately. In a joint statement, Labour’s Frank Field and Conservative Nicholas Soames said the order goes much further than rules operated in other EU countries. Some, including France and Germany, insist visitors have health insurance worth around £20,000 before they are granted a visa. The MPs said: ‘The public will be astonished to learn that access to GPs in the NHS has been opened to anyone in the world who comes to Britain. We believe that this is absolutely unacceptable at a time when the NHS is already struggling financially.’ The impact of the instruction, passed without debate in the Commons, was revealed in a report by think-tank Migration Watch. Earlier this year the Daily Mail reported how foreign students and tourists must be given free treatment by GPs under human rights law. But the analysis by Migration Watch reveals this must also apply to illegal immigrants. Refugees and asylum seekers already have the right to free NHS care so are unaffected by the change. Joint statement: Conservative MP Nicholas Soames, left, and Labour MP Frank Field, right, said the situation was 'absolutely unacceptable' (file picture) The group’s chairman, Sir Andrew Green, said it threatened to turn the NHS into the ‘World Health Service’. Its provisions allow illegal migrants and foreign visitors full and free access to primary care services, which can be the first step to costly secondary treatment in hospital. Sir Andrew said: ‘At a time of intense pressure on the NHS this is an incredible decision. It is an open invitation to the whole world to come and take free advantage of a health service paid for by the taxes of the people of this country. Taxpayers will regard this as an insult and will want it reversed at once.’ GPs are paid £64 a year for any patient they register. Once registered, migrants will be entitled to the same care as all other patients and can receive free blood tests, jabs and – in certain cases – free prescription drugs. In some respects, the new rules will give overseas patients more rights than those living in the UK , who can be turned away from surgeries if they live a few yards outside the catchment area. In a statement, Mr Hunt said: ‘This is a National Health Service, not a global health service, and we must stamp out this abuse of the system. Where people are using registration to get free treatment through the backdoor, we will take action.’ n MINISTERS should break EU laws and test all foreign doctors on their English to ensure patient safety, Tory MPs Andrea Leadsom and Charlotte Leslie have insisted. Brussels currently bans the Government from carrying out such checks on European doctors.","New guidance says GPs cannot withhold appointment on the grounds that patient does not have identification .

She is alleged to have forced a three-year-old girl to expose her genitals on the webcam being watched by Paul Hanlon at his home in Edinburgh, Scotland. A joint investigation by the FBI and Interpol led to the arrest of Misty Reneedawn Wofford at her Texas home . Details of the child porn show were discovered when 25-year-old Hanlon was arrested on suspicion of distributing indecent images over the internet. A search of his computer revealed the name and location of Wofford as well as details of their discussion of using the three-year-old girl in their chats via Skype. The girl was the daughter of a couple Wofford was staying with in Webster, Texas.

Disgusting: Wofford is alleged to have forced a three-year-old girl expose her genitals on the webcam . Wofford was tracked down to her friend's apartment in Webster and arrested on child porn charges. She is alleged to have admitted that Hanlon encouraged her 'to do many things' to the child but she had never sexually assaulted her. Wofford also allegedly admitted exposing the child's genitals and nipples over the webcam. Detective David Nettles with Webster Police said: 'Information on Hanlon's computer allowed us to exact a search warrant. 'Mr Hanlon was held by Lothian and Borders Police on suspicion of distribution of indecent images. 'TA preview of the contents of his computer showed conversations of a disturbing nature and allowed us to obtain a search warrant for Wolford's home.'

Last year, his images were placed on the auction block at the American Folk Art Museum in New York. Ten of them were snowflakes, which he called snow crystals, and were priced at $4,800 each. The others show winter scenes. They were being offered by Carl Hammer, whose Chicago art gallery was showing 20 other Bentley photographs. In an interview with the Associated Press last year, Hammer said: 'They're remarkably beautiful. There are imperfections on the outer edges of the image itself and on the paper, but the images themselves are quite spectacular.' On display: Bentley's photos were showcased in his groundbreaking 1931 book, Snow Crystals . Exquisite detail: Ten of Wilson A Bentley's historic snowflake photos went on sale last year . Bentley's photos don't meet modern standards because he was 'working with crude equipment,' said Kenneth G. Libbrecht, who has written seven books on snowflakes and grows snow crystals in a laboratory. 'But he did it so well that hardly anybody bothered to photograph snowflakes for almost 100 years,' said Libbrecht, a physics professor at the California Institute of Technology. When Libbrecht became interested in snowflakes, he said, Bentley was still the standard. The method of singling out a crystal to photograph hasn't changed in all that time. 'You basically let the crystal fall on something, black or dark-colored, and then you have to pick it up with a toothpick or brush and put it on a glass slide,' Libbrecht said.

Houses that rise and fall with the level of groundwater have been touted as the latest solution to the now seemingly annual floods inundating portions of the UK every autumn. Over the past week, days of torrential rain have flooded roads and more than 900 homes across the UK, leaving hundreds unable to return to their homes. The Environment Agency has warned that the flood risk remains high across the country, with 277 alerts and 204 warnings in place in England and Wales. Scroll down for video . Amphibious living: This floating home, currently under construction on the banks of the Thames in Buckinghamshire, raises to safety when the river bursts its banks . Now authorities are looking at a range of solutions for dealing with ever more frequent floods, including homes which float as waters rise. Baca Architects were earlier this year granted permission to build Britain's first amphibious house along the banks of the Thames in Buckinghamshire. The house, which is a replacement for another property, rests on land, but in the event of the river bursting its banks, it is able to rise with the water to keep its inhabitants dry. The floating house is just one idea being looked at by the Environment Agency as it investigates new technologies for dealing with floods, the BBC reported. Flood risk engineer Tony Andryszewski said the agency is keen to look at how other countries deal with repeat flooding, particularly the Netherlands which is seen as a world leader in flood management technologies. Homes are frequently built on stilts in countries like Thailand, Burma, India and Bangladesh, which all have regions notoriously susceptible to catastrophic flooding. But the more elegant solution of homes that float is more rare, although examples of different designs exist in Germany, Canada, the U.S. and even Taggs Island in the UK. Rustic look: How the finished house will look in the leafy environs of Buckinghamshire. Amphibious houses are just one of a range of solutions being looked at by the Environment Agency . All mod cons: How the house will look inside, with its panoramic views across the Thames . The Baca project currently under construction in Bucks will however be the UK's first fully amphibious house. Part of the award-winning LifE (Long-term Initiatives for Flood-risk Environments) project, of which Baca is a partner, the house is designed as a free-floating pontoon resting in fixed foundations. 'The floating house is secured by four dolphins (permanent vertical posts) arranged close up to the sidewalls,' Baca explains. 'The assembly is sited within a wet dock comprising retaining walls and base slab. When flooding occurs the dock fills with water and the house rises accordingly.' Every aspect is designed to stop any water penetrating inside so if  a flood strikes the owners can  stay put. A carefully laid out garden will act as a natural early warning flood system, with terraces set at different levels designed to flood incrementally and alert the occupants well before the water reaches a threatening level. The lowest terrace will be planted with reeds, another with shrubs and plants, another will be lawn and the highest step will be a patio with access into the dining room. Floating mechanism: The house is sited within a wet dock comprising retaining walls and base slab. When flooding occurs the dock fills with water and the house rises accordingly . All the pipes, ducts and wires for water, gas, electricity and sewage disposal in such amphibious homes are flexible, designed to remain functional even when the house rises several metres from its usual position. With most of the land mass of the Netherlands lying below sea level, it is perhaps no surprise that the Dutch have developed the world's best flood management technologies. The inhabitants of the region of since the 12th century been draining delta swamps to create artificial dry land - areas known as polders - at first using pumps powered by their famous windmills, like those pictured below. There are now about 3,500 low-lying polders in the Netherlands. Although enclosed by dykes, they easily collect water from rain, rivers and the sea so must be constantly pumped to keep waters at bay. Dutch flood agency spokesman Jos Maccabiani told the BBC: 'Since the last major flood in 1953, in which more than 1,800 people died, this system has been upgraded to very high standards.' Computer simulations have been used to demonstrate that the Netherlands' modern flood defences should be able to withstand an inundation so severe it would be expected only once every 10,000 years, he added. 'Nevertheless, with the ever-increasing urbanisation of our polders and flood plains, spatial planning is increasingly combined with flood resilience,' Mr Maccabiani said. 'There are projects under way where urban revitalisation of a city is combined with the widening of the river bed, lowering the peak water levels, and others that look into flood-proofing the country's highway infrastructure.' With an estimated value of . £1.5million, it will cost around  20 per cent more than building a . conventional similar-sized home – but there should be major savings on . insurance costs. There will be no communities built . using Baca's floating homes, since regulations restrict new homes being . built so close to the river (the Bucks house is a replacement for . another which will be torn down), however the Environment agency and its . partners are also looking at other solutions to rising water levels. The LifE Project envisages a new approach to development that embraces water and allows for the increased risks posed by flooding as climate change raises water levels across the world. With the UK currently in the grip of a housing crisis, it is hoped the project will unlock sites that are currently not considered suitable for development by managing and reducing flood risk overall. By building in features to developments that can both help prevent flooding, and lessen its impact when it is unavoidable, the project focuses on managing risk that can help homeowners, and insurers, plan for the future. A spokesman for Baca said: 'Amphibious houses or sometimes known as 'can-float' homes are a new phenomenon in the UK. 'As the cost of flood events start to have a more significant bearing on the public purse and the insurance secure demand higher levels of protection from the individual, flood resilient homes will become more common place. 'In the future communities that are holistically planned - that is to consider landscaping, urban design, energy and architecture simultaneously will be better prepared for flood events and climate change. 'Dwellings will be low carbon, and organized around multifunctional landscapes that will help control surface water flooding or act a large flood storage areas. 'New communities will be made up of streets of flood resilient dwellings located on the highest ground with amphibious homes located in the transitional zones between development and the natural environment. 'The long-term goal is to design communities that function as normal, preserving continuity of daily life during droughts and floods. Our intention, through our research and built work is that we can demonstrate that the future is not far away.'","House is fixed in a dock and designed to rise as waters fill the foundations .

This year alone the charity has rescued 1,050 dogs and 9,000 in the past six years across the US and Canada. The dogs rescued in this raid in March were kept in small, wire enclosures and many were malnourished or suffering a variety of medical conditions. They have since been put up for adoption.

The loving wife of a desperately ill musician yesterday won her fight to force a hospital to keep treating him. Doctors had wanted to withhold potentially lifesaving care from David James, 68. But a senior judge overruled them, saying they had failed to fully credit the importance of his ‘continued existence’. 'Continued existence': David James, 68, will continue to receive care after a senior judge ruled that doctors had undervalued the limited quality of life Mr James could still enjoy . Sitting at the Court of Protection, Mr Justice Jackson said the doctors had undervalued the limited quality of life Mr James could still enjoy. He described the patient’s relationship with his family as ‘of the closest and most meaningful kind’ and this carried ‘great weight’ in his decision. In emotional evidence, relatives had insisted Mr James smiled when they visited and enjoyed reading the newspaper, listening to music and seeing his grandchildren. The landmark ruling means hospitals will have to pay greater attention to the wishes of families seeking continued treatment against medical advice. Mr James walked into hospital seven months ago with a stomach complaint, but contracted pneumonia that led to multiple organ failure. He has been kept alive despite suffering a stroke, a heart attack and kidney problems that have left him unable to speak or to breathe unaided. Earlier this week, the hospital treating him launched a legal bid to refuse ‘aggressive’ treatment – including restarting his heart – if he deteriorated further. It said the potential suffering outweighed the tiny chances of recovery. But his family opposed the hospital in court – accusing doctors of placing Mr James on the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway for end-of-life care to free up his intensive care bed. Mr Justice Jackson found for the relatives, saying that while Mr James’s position was ‘grim’, the proposed treatment was not ‘futile or overly burdensome’ – as doctors claimed. ‘Although the burdens of treatment are very great indeed, they have to be weighed against the benefits of a continued existence,’ he concluded. He said while there was next to no chance Mr James would ever leave hospital and resume his musical career, that did not mean there was ‘no prospect of recovery’. ‘Recovery does not mean a return to full health, but the resumption of a quality of life that David James would regard as worthwhile,’ he said. To insist otherwise ‘set the standard unduly high’. Loving wife Mrs May James, left, with her daughter Julie. Mrs James yesterday won her fight to force a hospital to keep treating him . Mr James’s daughter Julie, 48, said: ‘I feel absolutely overwhelmed. It just proves what the hospital has been trying to do is unlawful. It’s disgusting that we should have had to come to court in the first place. ‘It’s been a terrible time for us all, but the people I feel most sorry for now are the patients who don’t have families to fight for them like my dad has. ‘To be brutally honest I think it all comes down to costs – he’s been there for seven months, he’s become a liability and they want to free up a bed. ‘But the judge agreed with us, and hopefully it will stop other families having to go through what we have.’ Mr James, a well-known guitarist in . his native Liverpool, who played on the 1974 hit Who Do You Think You . Are? by Candlewick Green, overcame bowel cancer ten years ago. But . in May he was admitted to the hospital – which cannot be named for . legal reasons – with constipation, initially seeming to be doing well, . the court heard. However . later that month he became critically ill after contracting . hospital-acquired pneumonia and was moved to intensive care. Mr James, pictured earlier this year, walked into hospital seven months ago with a stomach complaint, but got pneumonia that led to multiple organ failure. Judge Justice Jackson, right, overruled doctors yesterday . Doctors warned his family he was unlikely to survive, and over the next few weeks he sustained brain damage from a stroke and became dependent on a ventilator. Mr James has also suffered a heart attack and near-kidney failure as well as contracting repeated infections, but each time bounced back. He can no longer speak and although his family believe they can lip-read words that he mouths he has been unable to express his wishes over further treatment. The hospital trust applied for a court order stating that it would be lawful for them to withhold three types of potentially lifesaving treatment if his condition were to deteriorate further. The three were: . Invasive support for chronic low blood pressure – treatment the hospital claimed was painful and distressing; . Renal replacement therapy – a form of kidney dialysis that can leave patients shivering uncontrollably for hours; . Cardiopulmonary resuscitation –chest compressions to restart his heart which could fracture his ribs. The court heard that if the judge agreed to this course, Mr James would eventually suffer further infections which would cause him to slip into a coma and die. An independent intensive care consultant who examined Mr James for the Official Solicitor, who is acting on his behalf independently of his family, backed the hospital’s argument that he is in distress. Christopher Danbury concluded Mr James was only ‘minimally conscious’ and gave a less than 1 per cent chance of recovery. May, his 67-year-old wife of 50 years, told the court that when he overcame bowel cancer a decade earlier, his attitude was ‘This isn’t going to beat me’ and she was convinced he still felt the same way. Yesterday the Official Solicitor’s barrister, Michael Mylonas QC, said that while Mr James derived some limited pleasure from life, to provide the treatment the hospital wanted to withhold would be disproportionate given the minimal good it would do. But Theresa Pepper, for Mrs James and her daughter, pointed out he enjoyed visits and appeared to retain his sense of humour. She said the family accepted there may come a time when it would be hopeless to keep trying to save him, but that point had not yet been reached. ‘It may be that there isn’t a joyous outcome, but surely what Mr James does deserve is time,’ she concluded. Rejecting the hospital’s application, the judge stressed that exactly how to treat Mr James in future remained a matter for the doctors to decide. ‘If there is another crisis, the doctors and the family will have to try to reach a common view,’ he said. ‘It may be that this will involve treatment of one kind or another; it may be that the family will agree that Mr James has had enough.’ He paid tribute to the skill of the medical professionals treating Mr James and accepted that they had not put him on the Pathway. Vikram Sachdeva, representing the trust, applied for permission to appeal, but Mr Justice Jackson refused, saying it would need to apply to the Court of Appeal. Afterwards a trust spokesman said: ‘Our critical care teams continue to give Mr James dedicated, specialist care to meet his clinical needs. We will review the judgement and decide on the appropriate next steps for Mr James’s care.’","Doctors had wanted to withhold potentially lifesaving care from father .

Mr Knox told Judge Simon Bourne-Arton: 'In the struggle that took place, the reality is he came off worse. 'He accepts there was a struggle with the householder and accepts he would have been terrified, confronting someone in his home at night.' Daley, from Middlesbrough, who admitted burglary, was told by the judge: 'This is a bad case and you know it is bad. 'It was a burglary committed at night when the occupants were asleep, they were disturbed and a struggle ensued. 'Although you may not have got the better of that struggle, you were quite prepared to get into it. You have a very, very bad record. 'You were full of drugs. There was no thought process, no thought of the impact or misery you cause to those whose home you went into.'

'I'm going to pray and meditate and be with my kids and love them and do the very best I can.'

Popular: Professor Paul Frampton has asked that his salary at UNC be doubled while he awaits drug smuggling charges in Argentina . A physics professor, who has spent almost a year in an Argentinian jail awaiting his drug smuggling trial, has written to his employer asking to be paid double his salary. Paul Frampton, 68, has sent a letter to the provost of the University of North Carolina saying he should have his $107,000 salary reinstated - and then be paid twice as much. The British professor is being held in a Buenos Aires prison after being caught with a case containing more than 4lb of cocaine. The scientist – who faces 16 years in . prison – claims he was tricked into believing he was carrying it for a . bikini model Denise Milani through a 'honey trap scheme'. Mark Williams, a UNC math professor, told ABC: 'Most people would think its crazy for a man in prison to ask for a raise, but if you look closely, he has a good case.' Mr Williams said that his friend of 25 years is known to be excessively naive. Mr . Frampton wrote to Provost Bruce Carney to make the point that he ranks . 18th on the pay scale of the 28 professors in his department despite the . fact he is cited the most. He has not been paid since March 1 when he was put on leave after the scandal broke. UNC declined to comment on Mr Frampton's request but said that he remained a valued member of staff. Since he has been in jail, Mr Frampton has written at least three physics' articles one of which has been published. Fake: Bikini model Denise Milani had her identity used by a drug smuggling gang who allegedly lured the physics professor into smuggling a suitcase of cocaine . Prof Frampton, who is professor of physics and astronomy, said he had been communicating online with someone claiming to be Denise Milani for 11 weeks before his arrest earlier this year. He said he had met the person he thought was the model, who was crowned Miss Bikini World 2007, on dating website mate1.com and planned to start a new life with her. In January he flew to the Bolivian capital La Paz to meet her, on a ticket he thought had been paid for by her manager, a man he spoke to by phone. But when no one turned up after ten days, he claims he was persuaded to travel to Argentina to catch up with her there instead. He says he was met instead by a Bolivian man, who gave him a suitcase to take to Buenos Aires for Miss Milani, who had apparently flown there for a modelling trip. Place of work: Dr Frampton is one of 28 physics professors at the University of North Carolina - but is 18th on the pay scale . When she did not turn up, he tried to . board a plane home, but was arrested after the cocaine was found in a . false lining of the case. Argentinian authorities insist there is no evidence the brunette was aware her identity was being used. The professor, who was born in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, is being held at Villa Devoto Prison in Buenos Aires. Leading academics including 1979 Nobel . prizewinner Sheldon Glashow, who has worked on more than a dozen . scientific papers with Professor Frampton, have written to the judge in . his case to plead his innocence.","Paul Frampton, 68, has been in a Buenos Aires prison for ten months .

"By . Martin Beckford . PUBLISHED: . 20:37 EST, 17 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:37 EST, 17 November 2012 . Thousands of police officers who retire at 50 are walking into well-paid civilian jobs at their old stations while also enjoying generous pensions. Figures obtained by The Mail on Sunday show that at least 3,600 former constables, sergeants and inspectors are ‘double-dipping’ after leaving the front line while still relatively young then going back to work in the same forces. They can take up their new positions just weeks after retiring with a tax-free cash lump sum and an annual pension averaging £15,000. Back to work: 3,600 police officers who retire at 50 go back to their forces to work as receptionists, crime-scene technicians and other related jobs. File picture . Altogether, they are earning a total of £73 million a year by becoming chauffeurs, call handlers, receptionists, crime-scene technicians and even dog kennel assistants. Senior officers have also retired to take on top posts. They include Andy Trotter, a former deputy assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard who now runs the British Transport Police, and Sir Ian Johnston, another former Met chief who became Director of Security and Resilience for the Olympics. But the widespread practice is under threat as the Government forces through plans to raise the normal pension age to 60 for police officers, in line with other public-sector workers. Edward Boyd, a Research Fellow at the think-tank Policy Exchange, said: ‘Police officers remain extremely employable even after the average retirement age of 50. 'Given this, and in the absence of evidence that police officers have a lower life expectancy than the general population, raising the pension age to 60 would be a sensible approach to make policing more affordable in these straitened times.’ 'Double-dip: Matthew Sinclair of the Taxpayers' Alliance says police officers should continue to draw a salary or their pensions, not both . Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Police officers retiring must either claim their pension or a salary if they continue to work for the force. 'They shouldn’t be allowed to double dip and do both at taxpayers’ expense.’ The majority of the 134,000 police officers in England and Wales are members of an old pension scheme that means they can retire by 50 if they have served for 30 years. They are entitled to a pension worth two-thirds of their final salary and a lump sum. Those who joined after 2006 must wait until 55 to retire and receive half of their final salary. Home Secretary Theresa May wants to raise the pension age to 60 and increase officers’ contributions as part of a wider shake-up of pay and conditions. These changes are being fiercely resisted. Police say early retirement ages are justified because of the physical demands and risks involved in fighting crime, and that the public would not be kept safe by unfit or older officers. Clint Elliott of the National Association of Retired Police Officers said: ‘Our argument has always been that it should be the best person for the job. I don’t see any reason why police officers’ employment opportunities should be restricted.’","Ex-police officers work as dog kennel workers, chauffers and other jobs .

The only problem was that when the Severn got too high they invariably ended up marooned in it. Rather than move, however, the couple came up with a perfect – if expensive – solution to the problem and spent £100,000 having the £140,000 home raised 12ft off the ground to create what amounts to a bungalow on stilts. They decided to take action after their bungalow stood 4ft 6ins under water in 2007 - and cashed in part of their pensions to fund the project. After builders carefully raised the bungalow, in Sandhurst, Glos., the couple saw their forward planning pay off in last week's heavy floods. Defiant: Sam and Dawn Ray had their home raised on to stilts and now are protected from flooding . Left: Dawn Ray and her dog were caught in a flood in 1990. Here they are . seen being aided by neighbour Ken Whitfields. Right: Mr and Mrs Ray at home counting the cost of a flood in 2000 . Retired greyhound trainer Mr Ray, 75, watched as heavy rain and winds lashed at his home last week - with flood water lapping 2ft above the ground. But thanks to the stilts, the pair could shelter in a dry home. The area where the kitchen and conservatory once stood still remains under 1ft of water. Mr Ray, who has nicknamed their home the 'bunga-high' instead of bungalow, said they were delighted with the results of the work. Overhaul: Mr and Mrs Ray's house during its renovation in October 2009 - after water from the River Severn repeatedly gushed into their home and made it uninhabitable . Temporary: The wooden outhouse where the couple lived while they waited for the work to be done . He said: 'We just couldn't face being flooded again, but we can sleep at night now. 'The planners weren't keen at first but our MP Laurence Robertson was very helpful to us when we needed to get planning permission.' The couple cashed in some of their savings and used insurance money to pay for the £100,000 work, which started in 2009. Their home was left uninhabitable following the 2007 floods and could not be sold easily. Mr Ray said the work was costly but has turned the couple's lives around as they now have a house they can live in and sell in the future. Tall order: The house required extensive building work in order to elevate it 12ft off the ground . Flood: Sam and Dawn Ray's home in 2000 during the height of a flood which made their home uninhabitable . Their house insurance has also dropped from a four-figure sum with a £15,000 excess to less than Mr Ray pays for his car insurance. He said his only regret was that the builder who implemented his plans, Mark Saysell, 55, died in August before he saw the scheme working. 'He did a great job and I wish he could have seen it work,' he added. Water levels in Sandhurst are dropping but remain at 3ft deep in places - with councils attending more than 600 calls for assistance from flood victims in the last 10 days. Relieved: The couple watched from their new balcony as the flood water lashed . around the stilts .","Retired couple Sam and Dawn Ray used pension money to raise their Sandhurst home onto stilts .

And the north London house, which has become an unofficial shrine to the singer, was today sold for just £1.9million. Auction: Singer Amy Winehouse died from alcohol poisoning at the house in Camden, north London, which today sold for £1.9million - nearly one million less than the original asking price . Prime location: The large property overlooks London's Camden Square, where the singer lived before she passed away last July . The . house, which overlooks London's Camden Square, has become a much visited spot after the musician died from alcohol poisoning at the . age of 27 last July. She was five times the drink drive limit. After her death fans held vigils outside the the home to pay tribute to the star. The property was bought by a couple in their 40s at auctioneers McHugh & Co at BAFTA members club in Piccadilly, central London. The new owners, who were dressed casually in jeans and jumpers, declined to comment afterwards with the man saying: 'I’d rather not discuss it.' Amy Winehouse’s father Mitch told of his sorrow at selling the house where the wayward star died, saying: 'We are very sorry to see it go.' Music from the heart: Amy poured her emotions into her music which has continued to be popular with fans following her untimely death . An unofficial shrine: Two fans of singer Amy Winehouse console each other outside the singer's Camden home shortly after her death last year . A fan site: The Camden house is still visited by fans who continue to leave tributes to the star 15 months after her death . There was interest from four parties, including one phone bidder, after auctioneer Chris McHugh started the bidding at £1.7million. He described the house in Camden Square, north London, as a ‘substantial property in beautiful condition.’ It is described in the catalogue as being of an ‘exceptionally high standard’ and situated ‘in a most sought after residential area.’ Legend: The family of Amy Winehouse struggled to sell the late singer's former home after being inundated with viewing requests from fans rather than genuine buyers . The four-storey, semi detached house has three bedrooms, large garden, underfloor heating and a music room with sound proofed walls. Mr McHugh said the property also boasted a gym but added the equipment has since been removed. It originally went on the market for £2.8million in May but failed to sell. However it went for £1,980,000 after today’s tense 10-minute auction which the auctioneer said was ‘no price for this house’. Amy’s family asked auctioneers not to promote the sale by revealing who had lived there. They are also thought to have vetted potential buyers beforehand to ensure there were no time wasters. The house is still surrounded by tributes 15 months after the 27-year-old died from alcohol poisoning. It is thought would-be buyers were put off by the constant stream of fans and tourists gathering outside. After the Rehab star’s death last summer there were plans to transform the property into the headquarters for the Amy Winehouse Foundation charity set up in her name, but this was shelved due to fears there would be constant attention from fans. Amy was found dead in her flat by her live-in security guard on July 23 last year. An inquest heard bottles of vodka were found in her bedroom and she had five times the legal drink-drive limit of alcohol in her blood. But the troubled star, who battled drug addiction, was found to have no illegal substances in her body at the time she died and a coroner recorded a verdict of death by misadventure. Since her death the five-times Grammy winner has gone on to become the bestselling artist of the 21st century with her 2006 album Back to Black.","The house in Camden, north London, was today bought for £1.9million .

TV presenter Michael Palin dismissed a suggestion today that a film producer was a seventh member of the Monty Python comedy team. The star is currently battling the claims of Mark Forstater, producer of the film Monty Python And The Holy Grail, for a share in the royalties from the stage musical Spamalot. The West End show has proved to be a popular spin-off to the Holy Grail movie. Mr Forstater, 69, believes he was promised an equal share of all . Holy Grail merchandising and off-shoots – along with stars Palin, Eric Idle, John Cleese, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam and Graham . Chapman. Reunited: Michael Palin, Eric Idle and Terry Jones pictured ahead of the . High Court case in a dispute over the hit musical Spamalot . But Palin today told a High Court trial that the idea that Mr Forstater was a “seventh Python” would not have been accepted. He said: 'It may have been what he wanted but it was never going to be accepted by the Pythons. 'The idea of a ""seventh Python"" just doesn’t happen. It was never going to be accepted. 'I don’t think there was ever any suggestion this man was going to be a ""seventh Python"".' Palin said Mr Forstater had not 'created' Monty Python And The Holy Grail. 'The film had been created by the Python team entirely,' he added. 'Mark came on board. He became the producer. But I don’t think he was entitled to anything beyond that. 'Mark was not part of our team.' He also said it was unlikely that that Mr Forstater had 'input' into writing the Grail film. 'It doesn’t seem really likely to me,' he told the court. 'There were six of us. We were a tight group. We wrote our own material.' The Palace Theatre in London, where Spamalot! premiered in 2006 . Palin said 'major decisions' would have been taken by 'the Pythons themselves'. 'I find it really bizarre that Mark should think he would have been . there writing the film with us,' he added. 'It just wouldn’t happen.' Spamalot has already grossed more than £110million during a four-year stint on Broadway. The High . Court last week heard how Mr Forstater, of Queens Park, West London, was in . financial difficulties having been declared bankrupt. His lawyer Tom . Weisselberg said the row broke out after the ‘huge international . commercial success of Spamalot,’ which is currently running in the West . End. He said that for financial purposes, Mr Forstater should be treated as ‘the seventh Python’. He told Mr Justice Norris: ‘This claim . arises out of a dispute regarding profit-sharing of revenues from the . British comedy film Monty Python and the Holy Grail. ‘Regrettably, the parties have not . been able to resolve the dispute. Mr Forstater is in difficult financial . circumstances and has been forced to bring these proceedings.’ He said the claim concerns the . interpretation of a profit-sharing agreement signed by Mr Forstater with . the Pythons’ company back in 1974, the year before the Holy Grail film . was released. The six Pythons: The comedy pioneers took on the legend of King Arthur in the 1975 film, which descended into typical Python madness within approximately 30 seconds . Number 7? Mark Forstater, producer of Monty Python And The Holy Grail, arrives at court today . Mr Forstater claims he signed an agreement to allow him one seventh of the Pythons’ share of any merchandising and spin-offs. The surviving Pythons claim this sum . was only ever 1/14. Exactly how much Mr Forstater is claiming was not . stated in court, but after the hearing he told the Mail he was seeking a . ‘ball-park figure’ of £250,000. Mr Weisselberg added: ‘We say it is . common ground that Mr Forstater was entitled to a share in the . merchandising and spin-off from the film. The dispute relates to the . extent of that entitlement. ‘The outrage expressed by a number of . Pythons in their witness statements as to the suggestion that Mr . Forstater was to be treated as the seventh Python is, with respect to . them, misguided.’ Jones, 70, Palin and Idle, both 69, . attended the start of the five-day hearing yesterday. They are expected . to give evidence next week. However, Cleese, 73, who lives in Monaco, . and Gilliam, 72, who is filming in Romania, will not appear. Written by . Idle, Spamalot opened on Broadway in February 2005 and moved to the West . End the following year. The sell-out musical, a comic take on the story . of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, has now returned for . another run in London. Monty Python's Spamalot! The play is a 'loving rip-off' of the Holy Grail film from 1975 . Palin is reported as referring to the . money-spinning musical, which includes the hit number Always Look On The . Bright Side Of Life, as his ‘pension plan’. Forstater is also claiming entitlement to money from the film company Freeway Cam which owns the copyright to the Holy Grail. The hearing continues.

Out of control: Ed Bagley is charged with torturing a teenager whom he kept captive at his Missouri home from the age of 16 . A woman pleaded guilty today to helping her husband keep a young woman locked up as a sex slave in their rural home. Marilyn Bagley, 47, and husband Edward had been scheduled for trial in February on multiple charges including sex trafficking. Prosecutors allege Edward Bagley, 45, persuaded a 16-year-old girl to live with the couple in Lebanon, Missouri. They say she was then given drugs and tortured until she was hospitalized in February 2009. The girl was a runaway and mentally disabled. The Bagleys had claimed the sex acts were consensual and part of the sexual lifestyle they practiced. Defense attorneys plan to show evidence of 'sadistic sexual assaults'. The girl allegedly suffered water-boarding, electric shock, piercing and mutilation, according to the Kansas City Star. Marilyn Bagley was in court this morning for an unannounced appearance. Her plea deal has recommended that she be sentenced to probation. Her husband faces life in prison for his prolonged torture of the young woman. Four other men have been charged for allegedly paying Bagley to have sex with his 'slave' and to watch webcam sessions of her being tortured. The girl, who cannot be identified, featured on the cover of S&M magazine Taboo in 2010 - and her 'Master Ed' was also photographed holding a rope. Horrors: The young woman, who is mentally disabled, was drugged and kept as a sex slave at the Bagleys' trailer . The sordid case has caused some S&M advocates to fear a negative reaction to their lifestyle choices, which have come to public attention partly because of E.L. James's novel 50 Shades of Grey. Manipulation: The young woman was allegedly forced to appear on the cover of S&M magazine Taboo (her face has been blurred to protect her identity) Some worry it could open up people who practice bondage, dominance, sadism and masochism - or BDSM - to criminal charges for consensual acts they're already performing, said Susan Wright, founder of the Baltimore-based National Coalition for Sexual Freedom in September. 'We are following this case specifically because we were hoping this issue would not come up,' she said. Ed . Bagley is accused of grooming the young woman to be his sex slave from . 2002, then keeping her captive for years while making money from her . images on fetish Internet sites and forcing her to work as a dancer at . strip clubs. The case . came to light in early 2009 after the woman, then 23, was hospitalized . after what prosecutors said was a torture session. Then-U.S. Attorney . Beth Phillips called the case one of 'the most horrific ever prosecuted . in this district'. Advocates . for the BDSM community say even the most brutal acts detailed in . Bagley's federal indictment are not criminal acts, as long as there was . consent. But if the woman was too young or not . intelligent enough to consent, as prosecutors allege, or if she . initially gave consent and then changed her mind, it amounts to criminal . sexual abuse. As in several other states, Missouri assault laws limit instances in which consent can be used as a defense against criminal charges when serious injuries occur. Exceptions generally are made for athletic activities and the victim's occupation or professions in which the conduct and harm are reasonably foreseeable hazards. Wright's group contends 'serious physical injury' is not well-defined under law. 'The assessment of the seriousness of harm is often affected by judges' ""moral judgments about the iniquity of the conduct,""' the organization says on its website in a section focusing on the consent issue. 'Courts tend to inflate the risk and harmfulness of an activity they want to denounce. For example, any injury caused during a sadomasochistic encounter has been consistently classified as serious.' Wright notes that regardless of the legal precedent, prosecutors' attempts to present acts between Bagley and his wife as evidence in the Missouri case also comes at a time when kinky sex practices appear to be gaining broader public acceptance amid the popularity of the E.L. James 50 Shades of Grey bondage books. 'Because of 50 Shades of Grey, a lot of people are trying BDSM for the first time this year,' she said. 'We want to be sure they understand they have to do these activities consensually, and to make sure they have the skill to do them safely.'","Marilyn Bagley, 47, pleaded guilty to abuse of young woman in Missouri .

Doctors told her family that she would die of the mystery illness, as they felt there was little they could do to saver her. 'They told the family that she was going to die, that you need to come say goodbye,' said Amber Shoebridge, public relations officer at Legacy Emanuel Medical Center. But a specialized emergency team at Legacy Emanuel was able to stabilize her with 'extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,' a technology that provides support to patients whose heart and lungs are severely damaged and cannot function on their own. The gangrene continued to spread, however, and surgeons were forced to amputate Schulke's legs at each knee. As she fights for her life in a critical care unit, doctors are beginning to think she may be suffering from toxic shock syndrome, a disease with a 50 percent chance of survival caused by staph infections. The condition can be triggered after a cut or wound becomes infected. Women who are menstruating or using barrer contraceptive devices are more likely to contract the disease. Lab studies will confirm whether Schulke's infection was caused by toxic shock. Schulke's doctors told ABC News that while she is still in critical condition, they are hopeful that she'll recover. Survival: Katie Zimmerman, the teen's aunt, said: Just her surviving, that's all that matters. Not Christmas, not anything, just... we want Tabi' 'She's improving very much so,' Shoebridge said. 'She's a little more responsive than she had been.' Zimmerman said Shulke has responded by squeezing her hand when she asks her to give her a sign of whether she is in pain. Crying, Zimmerman told ABC, 'She's beautiful on the outside, but she's even more beautiful on the inside.'

An Arizona woman who was convicted in her young son's disappearance nearly three years ago was sentenced Friday to five years and three months in prison after tearfully telling the judge she thought she deserved the maximum of nine years and six months. Elizabeth Johnson, 26, was convicted in October of custodial interference and unlawful imprisonment in the Christmastime 2009 disappearance of her then-8-month-old son, Gabriel. The jury failed to reach a verdict on a kidnapping charge — the most serious count against her. Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Joseph Kreamer also sentenced Johnson to four years of probation when she is released. She'll receive credit toward her prison sentence for the nearly three years that she has served in jail since her arrest. Convicted: Elizabeth Johnson, 26, was convicted in her young son's disappearance nearly three years ago . Her story: Johnson initially told the boy's father, Logan McQueary, that she killed Gabriel and dumped him in a trash bin, but she later recanted and told police she gave the infant to a couple at a San Antonio, Texas, park . Prior to sentencing, Johnson stood before the judge sobbing and apologized for what she did, but she maintained her story that she gave Gabriel away to a couple in Texas. 'I wanted to give Gabriel a life that was better than I had growing up,' she said softly. 'What I have done is unbelievable. There's not really anything I can say for myself. 'I would convict myself,' Johnson added. 'It's horrible. ... I do deserve the max.' Kreamer could have sentenced her to 9 1/2 years but said he took into account her troubled childhood and mental instability, agreeing with a psychologist who testified she needs treatment. 'Her chances to succeed are increased if she gets treatment, there's no doubt about it,' the judge said while noting he had to give her prison time, given that Gabriel is still missing. 'We are three years downstream. We don't know where Gabriel is,' he said. Apologetic: Prior to sentencing, Johnson stood before the judge sobbing and apologized for what she did, but she maintained her story that she gave Gabriel away to a couple in Texas . Gone: Eight month-old Gabriel Johnson was last seen with his mother in San Antonio three years ago . Authorities said Johnson initially told the boy's father, Logan McQueary, that she killed Gabriel and dumped him in a trash bin, but she later recanted and told police she gave the infant to a couple at a San Antonio, Texas, park. She never provided the couple's names and refused to do so during Friday's hearing. Prosecutor Angela Andrews offered to only seek probation if Johnson would tell them where Gabriel is, not just 'vague statements, but his actual physical whereabouts' Prosecutor Angela Andrews offered to . only seek probation if Johnson would tell them where Gabriel is, not . just 'vague statements, but his actual physical whereabouts.' After the hearing, Andrews said no one knows but Johnson if Gabriel, who would have turned 3 this past April, is still alive. 'She's the only person that has the answer,' Andrews said. 'We just wanted her to give it to us.' Gabriel's paternal grandfather, Frank McQueary, and other family members pleaded with Johnson to explain what happened to Gabriel in tearful testimony asking the judge to sentence her to the maximum prison term. 'This isn't over for our family,' McQueary said. 'This is not going to be over until we know where Gabriel is.' Prosecutors say Johnson ran off to Texas with the child as a way to retaliate against his father for ending their tumultuous relationship. The father isn't suspected in the child's disappearance. 'What Elizabeth has done has not only robbed me but also my friends and family,' Logan McQueary said in court by telephone. 'I did not get to hear Gabe's first word. I did not get to see him walk or run. ... I do not get to see what a great man he would have been.' Johnson's attorney Marc Victor, who wanted probation for his client, cited Johnson's lack of prior felony convictions, her youth and other factors in seeking a lesser sentence.

She signed over temporary guardianship of the boy to a Scottsdale couple for about 10 days before she picked him up and left Arizona . Sandy Peters, Logan McQueary's aunt, said the family was pleased with the sentence but nothing will bring closure until they find Gabriel. 'It's never been about how long she stays in prison,' Peters said. 'It's just about trying to find Gabriel.' The boy was last seen with his mother on Dec. 26, 2009, at a hotel in San Antonio.

She signed over temporary guardianship of the boy to a Scottsdale couple for about 10 days before she picked him up and left Arizona. Remorse? Johnson begged the judge to give her the maximum sentence, saying she deserved it . The would-be adoptive mother from Scottsdale, Tammi Peters Smith, was accused of lying on a court document about the child's possible paternity in an effort to keep Gabriel from his father. Smith was convicted of forgery and conspiracy to commit custodial interference. In 2010, San Antonio police scoured a landfill that contained trash from the hotel where Gabriel was last seen. The search turned up no body or other evidence.","Elizabeth Johnson, 26, sentenced to five years and three months in prison after begging judge for maximum sentence of nine years and six months .

Despite being shunned as disruptive outsiders across huge swathes of the continent gypsies have European roots stretching more than a millennium ago, research has found. The Romani, Europe's largest minority group with approximately 11 million people, speak a mosaic of languages and practice different religions and lifestyle - but all share a common if complex past. Genetic scientists have now found they began their migration into Europe 1,500 years ago, much earlier than previously thought, from a single population in northern India. Despite their beginnings the size of . the Romani population now rivals that of several countries, including . Greece, Portugal, and Belgium. They first arrived through the Balkans and began dispersing outwards from there 900 years ago, the team found. They first arrived in the UK in 1513, the team believe. Professor David Comas, of the Institut de Biologia Evolutiva at Universitat Pompeu . Fabra in Spain, said:'We . were interested in exploring the population history of European Romani . because they constitute an important fraction of the European . population, but their marginalised situation in many countries also . seems to have affected their visibility in scientific studies.' The graph shows the Romani population throughout Europe. The blue numbers indicate when the communities are thought to have settled in the country . The Romani people lack written . historical records on their origins and dispersal so the team gathered genome-wide data from 13 Romani groups collected . across Europe to confirm an Indian origin for European Romani, . consistent with earlier linguistic studies.

The study in journal Current Biology offers . the first genome-wide perspective on Romani origins and demographic . history. The authors claim that their findings could have implications for various disciplines including human evolution and health sciences. 'From a genome-wide perspective, Romani people share a common and unique history that consists of two elements - the roots in northwestern India and the admixture with non-Romani Europeans accumulating with different magnitudes during the out-of-India migration across Europe,' co-author Professor Manfred Kayser from Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands said. 'Our study clearly illustrates that understanding the Romani's genetic legacy is necessary to complete the genetic characterisation of Europeans as a whole, with implications for various fields, from human evolution to the health sciences.' In the UK Gypsies were originally thought to have come from Egypt and early European references describe wandering, nomadic communities who were known for their music and skill with horses. The earliest references to gypsies come from Spain in the 15th Century. They are traditionally thought of as nomadic groups and have suffered centuries of discrimination, including extermination by some 20th-century fascist regimes including HItler and Stalin. Campaign groups the European Roma Rights Centre in Hungary say that the persecution and discrimination is still rife against the group which are now found to have settled in the sixth century. Robert Kushner, chairman of the board of the ERRC, said: 'I think Roma has been discriminated against in Europe almost since their arrival and they continue to suffer discrimination and structural poverty throughout Europe today. 'The vast majority of them are now settled. There are of course a great number of migrants but it is a different phenomenon, these are people seeking better lives because of discrimination, they're looking for jobs, looking for places to put their children through school.

'In some countries Roma will compromise 25 per cent of the work force in the near future so for a whole number of reasons - economic, moral, and for legal obligations to human rights - the discrimination should be addressed.' Despite their longstanding roots the communities are still segregated and subjected to 'hate speech' even by public figures, Mr Kushner said. The communities have recently been targeted both in France, during Nicolas Sarkozy's presidency, and Italy, under Silvio Berlusconi, and suffered from forced evictions.

Attorneys for Taylor Murphy, 29, attempted to damage Charriez's credibility during fierce questioning. Their client stands accused of a vicious attack on the transgender model in August 2011. Choked: Charriez demonstrates to the courtroom how she was attacked . Face-off: Claudia Charriez (left) accuses Taylor Murphy (right) of a violent attack in August 2011 . According to the New York Daily News, Murphy's defense attorney Jason Berland began by asking the former call-girl, who was kicked off American's Next Top Model in 2006 for being born a man, about her venereal disease. 'You (worked as an escort) knowing that you could potentially transmit that disease?' asked Berland. 'I was an escort, not a prostitute. I do not have sex for money,' Charriez replied. 'Whether or not I chose to engage in sexual activity with someone - protected - was my choice,' she said. 'What does this have anything to do with him hurting me?' 'Grilled': The transgendered model responds to fierce questioning during the trial at Manhattan Supreme Court . Charriez, dressed in a black mini-skirt, blazer and heels, endured over four hours of exhausting cross-examination in the courtroom yesterday. Berland asked the model as to why she charged her clients $300 per hour if she wasn’t offering sex. The defense claims that at one point her hourly rate jumped to $600. 'Dinner dates. Accompanied them on many different occasions,' replied Charriez. The defense inquired if the model had been taking estrogen over the period in question. 'I don’t need hormone therapy because at a very young age I was castrated,'  Charriez claimed. Berland then asked her about a deceased former boyfriend, allegedly the subject of tension between Murphy and Charriez. The model was upset by this line of questioning and screamed 'You shouldn’t talk about dead people' as she was escorted out of the courtroom. Murphy is accused of assaulting his ex-lover, Charriez, in the summer of 2011. The firefighter previously worked . with Engine 59 and Engine 7, Ladder 1 in lower Manhattan. He is best . known as Mr March in a 2011 firefighters calendar. But the FDNY said the calendar Murphy posed in was not affiliated with the department. At yesterday's hearing an unidentified woman waving a copy of the calendar shouted 'I love you Taylor!' before being bundled out of the court by officials. 'Hunky': Taylor Murphy is best known for his topless firefighters calendar. In court yesterday a woman burst into court with the image, screaming 'I love you Taylor.' In opening statements of Murphy's trial on Thursday, prosecutors claimed Murphy 'grabbed her with his massive hands' during the August dispute in their room at the Hotel Metro on 35th street. 'He punched her in the back on the right side, by the shoulder blade, assistant district attorney Kevin Rooney said, according to The New York Post. 'Enough to make her fear what was coming as he slammed the door shut... the two struggled. He bit her on the forearm. 'Ultimately he pinned her down on the bed... all 240 pounds of her on top of her, into her, until she felt like she was literally engulfed by the bed.' His voice rising, Rooney continued: 'He spit at her. Covering her mouth so she couldn't scream.' In his opening statement, defense lawyer Berland described the couple as having 'a textbook dysfunctional relationship.' Berland told jurors that Charriez had been working as a prostitute and the love affair 'unfortunately went south' when Murphy discovered the woman was sick with 'a venereal disease.' 'Because he loved her he begged her to stop working as an escort,' he said, according to The Post. 'But his pleas fell on deaf ears' and Murphy, who is bisexual and has a penchant for trannies, started seeing other people, which is when Charriez embarked on a campaign of threats and allegations against the firefighter. But the prosecution claims the breakup and subsequent beat-down was sparked by Murphy's drunken jealousy. Transgender: Claudia Charriez who was kicked off American's Next Top Model in 2006 for being born a man . On a separate evening, which ended in blows, the couple visited Times Square strip club Flashdancers where, according to The Post, Murphy wound up getting a lap dance and Charriez retaliated by chatting up patrons who mistook her for an employee. Tempers flared and they took their dispute outside. She called him various expletives, the prosecutor told jurors. Then started screaming 'Rape! Rape!' the defense lawyer claimed. Murphy allegedly slammed his date into a phone booth and dragged her down the sidewalk by the hair before the pair dashed back to their room in separate cabs. There, they eventually kissed and made up, prosecutors admitted. Victim: Prosecutors alleged Charriez, pictured, was dragged along the sidewalk by her hair . Jealousy: Prosecution claimed the attack against Charriez, pictured right with a friend, was sparked by Murphy's drunken jealousy . 'She realized she could not stop him,' Rooney said. 'She began to cry and she pulled him closer to her, then he started crying and they sat up in the room for several minutes.' But the two made plans to see each other the next afternoon, the defense lawyer said, while Charriez' lawyers admit they did get together soon after the brawl. Murphy is charged with felony strangulation and felony violation of an order of protection barring him from contacting his alleged victim, which he reportedly did 1,400 times in the space of three months in the form of text messages and phone calls.","Claudia Charriez, 31, forced by defense to discuss her venereal disease, life as a call-girl, and dead ex-boyfriend .

First Minister Alex Salmond has insisted an independent Scotland would automatically join the EU - something Brussels disputes . Nationalists have reacted angrily to a warning  that an independent Scotland would have to re-apply to the European Union. Eurocrats say Scotland would not have automatic membership if Scots decide to break away in the 2014 independence referendum. A leaked letter from the European Commission said the UK’s EU membership would ‘cease to apply’ to an independent Scotland. The letter, seen by The Scotsman newspaper, was destined for the Lords economic affairs sub-committee. It stated: ‘If a territory of a member state ceases to be part of that member state because it has become an independent state, then the treaties would cease to apply to that territory.’ But Scottish National Party members insisted they would have to ‘renegotiate’ rather than re-apply for membership. Finance secretary John Swinney said Scotland would still be part of the UK in the immediate aftermath of a vote for independence. He added: ‘Scotland would not be applying for membership. Scotland is already a member of the European Union, our citizens are EU citizens today, we follow all of the EU relevant provisions that we are required to follow. ‘Assuming there is a yes vote, Scotland will still be at that stage a part of the UK, and what we have always accepted is there has to be a negotiation about the details and the terms of Scotland’s membership of the EU. ‘But crucially that would be taking place at a time when we are still part of the UK, and still part of the EU of which we have been members for 40 years.’ He told the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland there was an important distinction between Scotland ‘applying’ and ‘negotiating’. But Manuel Barroso, the president of the European commission, appeared to confirm that membership treaties would no longer apply to a newly independent country. The Scottish independence referendum is being held in autumn 2014, when Mr Salmond hopes to capitalise on a patriotic mood marking 700th anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn . In a written answer to Scottish Labour MEP David Martin, Mr Barroso referred to previous legal advice issued in 2004. An independent Scotland would also have to be unanimously approved for membership by all other EU countries. But Spain, Belgium and Cyprus could be reluctant to do so as they are battling with nationalists at home. Spanish foreign minister Jose Manuel . Garcia-Margallo suggested in October that Scotland ‘would have to get to . the back of the queue’ if it wanted to re-apply to the EU.","European Commission letter to House of Lords says Scotland's membership will 'cease to apply' if it breaks away from the UK .

Long-lost sisters, who were reunited after 55 years apart, have discovered that they are in fact twins, separated at birth. Jenny Lucas and Helen Edwards, both 64, had no knowledge of each other after Jenny was given up for adoption until she tracked down her birth mother in 2003. When the pair met, they assumed they were half-sisters but were regularly surprised by their similarities such as the way they held their coffee cups and they would often go to call each other at the same time. Separated at birth: Jenny Lucas (right) and Helen Edwards (left) discovered they were long-lost twin sisters who have been reunited 55 years later . A DNA test in 2009 confirmed that they were full sisters but, still confused by their past they looked deeper into their late mother’s medical records only to discover that she had given birth to two babies on December 2, 1948, the date of Jenny’s birthday. Helen, from Morpeth, Northumberland, had always thought she was born on April 4, 1950, but medical records showed there had been no birth that day. Baffled by the mystery, the women believed that the second baby born on Jenny's birthday had most likely died but recent DNA tests have now confirmed that the sisters are actually non-identical twins. Whole childhood apart: Helen (pictured left at about two-years-old with father Wilfred Harrison) and Jenny (pictured right aged about 18-months-old with her adoptive parents) were separated when Jenny was given up for adoption . The ‘difficult’ discovery means Helen is actually 64-years-old, when she believed she was 62. Speaking today the sisters said the revelation left them with many unanswered questions about why there were separated at birth. But the sisters said they are ‘happy’ to finally have each other and have an explanation for the incredible similarities they share despite spending their whole lives apart. Retired surgical assistant, Helen, said: ‘I have been lied to about my birth all my life. ‘All the big dates in my life, like my 21st birthday, have been false. ‘This has been an incredible shock and it has been a very difficult time. ‘Jenny and I have gone through a real rollercoaster with this whole story. Discovering we were twins was happy news but a real shock. 'Difficult' discovery: Helen (right aged 18-years-old with mother) thought she was born on April 4, 1950 but discovered there had been no birth that day but two babies were born on December 2, 1948 - Jenny's birthday . ‘For twins to be separated at birth is hugely emotional, but does go some way to explain the similarities between us. We were brought up differently but are so alike.’ Jenny, a former professional golfer, from Tenterden, Kent, said: ‘Our mother’s medical records showed she had had five children, but all had been home births apart from the one in December, 1948, when she had been in hospital for 11 days which must have been because she had twins. ‘It was a huge shock to realise that I was in actual fact a twin but in many ways it made a lot of sense. ‘We are very alike, we have the same mannerisms, we hold our coffee cups the same way, we mirror each other on the little things - even when we first met. ‘We both have Chihuahua dogs too.’ Jenny, who discovered she was adopted when she was 14, began to search for her birth family in 1981. Having found her birth-aunt through her birth certificate, she was told her mother did not want to meet her because ‘too much water had passed under the bridge’. So alike: Jenny and Helen said the revelation was emotionally difficult but it explained their many similarities, despite growing up apart . Disheartened she went ahead with a move to Florida, in America with her husband Sam. When she returned to Britain in 2003, her cousin had managed to find her biological mother’s address. The mother-of-three plucked up the courage to visit her and was welcomed with open arms by her mother, who showered her with hugs and kisses. During the meeting, Jenny was told by her mother she must leave suddenly because her daughter Helen would be home soon, so she returned to America intrigued by the idea of a sister. When Jenny permanently moved back to the UK in 2007, her birth mother had passed away, leaving behind a death certificate listing Helen as her next of kin. Jenny tacked her down on social networking website Friends Reunited. The sisters, who believed they were born in wedlock, say they still have no idea why Jenny was put up for adoption and Helen was kept.","Jenny Lucas and Helen Edwards, both 64, were separated at birth .

Police are on the hunt for a group of ‘preppy’ muggers -- five dapper men, including one wearing a business suit, who last month reportedly assaulted a restaurant employee. Joshua Daniel Mosley, 30, of Raleigh, North Carolina, was taken to a local hospital after the early-morning attack on Saturday, November 24. Police are now using video surveillance footage of the five men, which was made public this week, to track down suspects, the Charlotte Observer reports. Preppy roughians: Five well-dressed men are said to have assaulted a local restaurant employee after going through his co-worker's purse. Two are shown here . Surveillance footage: Two of the suspected men were caught on camera shoving each other. It is unclear whether they were engaged in a dispute or roughhousing . Officers say the assault occurred in front of the Italian restaurant where Mosley worked between 2.30 and 3am, when most of the area’s bars began to close. The muggers seized Mosley’s co-worker’s purse and were digging through it when he ran over to help her, according to a police report of the incident. Police say the five men then punched and kicked Mosley until he became unconscious. ‘They worked me over pretty good,’ he told the Observer. ‘When they were through, they threw me on the ground.’ Suspected muggers: The men were described as wearing jeans, a pale yellow jacket, khakis, and loafers, while one was wearing a suit . Medical officials closed a gaping wound in the middle of Mosley’s forehead using glue. Look familiar? One of the men is caught on camera by himself . ‘It was either glue or 13 stitches,’ Mosley said. The assaulted restaurant employee said he also suffered a gash under his eye, injuries to his nose and bruises on his right arm due to the attack. He said he continues to suffer from headaches, dizziness and memory lapses two weeks after the incident. Mosley’s co-worker, Mia Longo, described the five muggers as being dressed ‘preppy.’ ‘Jeans, a pale yellow jacket, khakis, loafers,’ she told the Observer. ‘One was wearing a suit.’ Police obtained video surveillance footage from that morning, which includes images of the well-dressed men, but not the assault. The footage has not been released to the public yet. In two photos, two of the men can be seen shoving each other. It is unclear whether they were engaged in a dispute or roughhousing.

'Value for money': Climate change minister Greg Barker said the aid was a sensible investment which the UK's economy would benefit from . Spending almost £3billion of taxpayers’ money helping developing countries tackle climate change will save ‘British lives’, a minister has claimed. Each household is committed to contributing £116 to foreign aid projects, such as wind turbines in Africa and greener cattle farming in Colombia, over a four-year period ending in 2015. Conservative climate change minister Greg Barker said the £2.9billion was a sensible investment which was needed to prevent more ‘failed states’ as a result of ‘dangerous climate change’. Mr Barker, speaking at the UN climate talks in Doha, Qatar, added that the UK’s economy was well-placed to benefit from the growing global investment in renewable energy. Britain is the only developed nation that has so far publicly committed funds, known as climate aid, over the next three years to help poorer nations adapt to the impact of rising temperatures, such as floods and droughts. The pledge has angered some Tories, who believe the money could be better spent in times of economic hardship at home. Glyn Davies, Conservative MP for Montgomeryshire, said the Government’s spend on climate aid was a ‘complete waste’. He added: ‘Energy costs are impacting on British households and businesses. I think tackling that should be the absolute focus of the Government at the moment, not spending millions supporting wind farms abroad.’ But Mr Barker said: ‘We are extracting value for money [on climate aid]. I think it represents a sensible investment for British people. ‘If we turn our back on the developing world we will see more failed states, we will see countries struggling and failing to deal with the impact of dangerous climate change. And, ultimately, we pay the price in British lives.’ Helping developing countries: Foreign aid projects such as wind turbines in Africa will receive money over a four-year period ending in 2015 . Save 'British lives': Support foreign aid projects including greener cattle farming in Colombia mean the UK's economy will be well-placed to benefit from the growing global investment in renewable energy, Mr Barker said . The minister warned climate change would . be ‘a very aggravating factor’ that could threaten the future stability . of countries such as Somalia, Eritrea and Afghanistan. He said growing investment in the . renewable sector could also benefit Britain economically, adding: ‘These . talks are about making an audacious land-grab for the multi-trillion . low carbon market for the City of London.’ Britain’s . ‘climate aid’ includes more than £100million pledged for renewable . power generation in Africa, such as wind farms, solar, bio-energy and . hydroelectric power. Another . £21million has been pledged to provide better water resources . management for 18million of the world’s poorest inhabitants. Britain . is also giving the Colombian government £15million to support ‘low . carbon agriculture’ by helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions from . ranching. It aims to save carbon emissions, protect forests and improve . the livelihoods of farmers. Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: ‘The problem is sometimes people look at the  numbers rather than looking at the outcomes – the advantages of spending money in this way. Whether it’s bringing clean energy to Africa, whether it’s preventing the rainforest being chopped down in parts of  Latin America and Asia, these are huge benefits.’ In chaotic UN climate talks in Copenhagen in 2009, rich countries pledged to provide £6billion a year over three years as ‘fast start finance’. But with this pledge period ending, there has been little in the way of promises for further money to help developing countries grow sustainably and deal with the impacts of climate change. Oxfam climate change policy adviser Tracy Carty said: ‘The UK has taken a step forward, now we eagerly await other developed nations to follow suit.’","Foreign aid projects include wind turbines in Africa and greener cattle farming in Colombia .

"By . Luke Salkeld . UPDATED: . 06:54 EST, 12 January 2012 . Allegations: Dr Chuma Igbowke, Niger's official consul to Britain, is said to have made indecent proposals to a woman at a private hospital . An African diplomat working as a doctor in Britain sexually harassed and exposed himself to a secretary, an employment tribunal heard today. Dr Chuma Igbokwe, 45, is accused of making indecent proposals to administrator Vanessa Turley at a private hospital. The Republic of Niger’s official consul to Britain allegedly called 40-year-old Mrs Turley into his office and asked her if the locks on the door could be undone from the outside. When she told him they couldn’t, the hearing was told, the married doctor replied: ‘I want to **** over a desk.’ The tribunal also heard that Mrs Turley’s husband later received emails – later identified as being sent from Africa – claiming his wife was ‘a porn star, a prostitute and had been having affairs with men at work’. Mrs Turley, a mother-of-three, was left ‘totally shocked’ at her colleague’s behaviour at a private mental hospital, it was said. Launching a claim for unfair dismissal citing sexual harassment and bullying, she told the tribunal: ‘He called me into his office and asked if the locks on the door could be overridden. ‘I replied that I didn't think they could and he said: “Because I want to f*** you over the desk.”’ She continued: ‘I was left totally shocked and told him he should not say things of that nature as it was bad. ‘My treatment after that was unbearable - each time he visited the hospital he was rude and very abrupt to me.’ Mrs Turley then described how qualified psychiatrist Dr Igbokwe made a graphic sexual request to her in the ‘mayor’s parlour’ during a formal dinner held to mark the success of St Luke's Hospital in Ebbw Vale, South Wales. She told the tribunal: ‘This was disgusting and I couldn't believe he said it. I ignored him and turned away.’ Attack: Mrs Turley said Dr Igbokwe made a graphic sexual request to her during a formal dinner held to mark the success of St Luke's Hospital in Ebbw Vale, South Wales, where they worked . Mrs Turley also told the tribunal of an incident when the doctor asked her into his office. She said: ‘He held my hips from behind, thrusting himself against me and told me to sit down. ‘I was scared. He sat in the chair and was fumbling with his trouser fly zip. Claims: Mrs Turley told the court that the doctor actions were 'disgusting' ‘He stood in front of me preventing me from moving, exposed himself and gestured for me to perform a sexual act on him. ‘I pushed him aside and made haste to the door.’ She also alleged he would ask her to meet him at the Hilton Hotel in Newport. Mrs Turley did not complain to bosses at Essex-based St Luke's Health Group because, she said: ‘I was scared of him because he had such power. ‘He was the consul for Niger, he is a company director and chairman of various companies. How could I stand up against him?’ The tribunal in Cardiff heard Mrs Turley was demoted and after quitting her job in June last year went to the police to report her former boss. She told the tribunal: ‘My home life was suffering and my marriage was breaking down due to the stress. I was subjected to his bullying and victimised for up to a year.’ As well as the email claiming Mrs Turley was a prostitute, the tribunal was told her husband received another with a link to an internet porn site and a third one stating: ‘Now we know the truth about our star performers.’ The calls were traced by a computer expert friend of Mrs Turley's who discovered one was from Niger and another from a Sheridan Hotel in Nigeria. Dr Igbokwe is a founder and executive director of Mild Professional Homes, which is run by the St Luke's group. At the time of the alleged harassment, Dr Igbokwe was Niger's UK consul but he has now stepped down from the position. The tribunal heard Dr Igbokwe has been suspended by the General Medical Council who are investigating other complaints of sexual harassment against him. Mrs Turley is claiming unfair dismissal, sexual discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation against Dr Igbokwe and St Luke's Heath Care Group. They deny the case. The tribunal, expected to last three days, continues.","Dr Chuma Igboke accused of making indecent proposals to Vanessa Turley .

Recovery: Scarlett, pictured with her mother Samantha Roberts, survived after her father Richard Straw jumped in front of a train with her in his arms . A father who jumped in front of a train with his three-year-old daughter in his arms was devastated after discovering his partner had cheated on him with his best friend, an inquest heard yesterday. Richard Straw, 28, was holding Scarlett as he leapt into the path of an express train. He was killed instantly, but Scarlett was found on the trackside with terrible injuries. She is now four and has made a full recovery. The inquest was told that Mr Straw had discovered Scarlett’s mother Samantha Roberts, 27, had been seeing his best friend, Lee Bacon, behind his back. A week before he died, Mr Straw had been arrested on suspicion of setting fire to Mr Bacon’s home. He was distraught at the idea of anyone else ‘being Scarlett’s dad’, the inquest in Doncaster was told. The couple, who had been together for five years, had split up a month before Mr Straw’s death in July last year, with Miss Roberts leaving the family home. She had been seeing Mr Bacon since the April, when her relationship with Mr Straw, a warehouseman, was falling apart. The inquest heard they had rowed over his gambling and drinking.  Miss Roberts told the hearing Mr Straw had ‘found out properly’ about her relationship with Mr Bacon, 30, the day before he killed himself. He had acted aggressively, she said, but had calmed down by the next morning, when he arrived unannounced to take Scarlett for lunch and a trip to the park. ‘He seemed happy,’ she said. ‘He said to Scarlett to say goodbye to mummy and tell her you love her.’ But she grew worried when they failed to return, and went to Mr Straw’s house, where she found abusive graffiti scrawled on the walls. One message read ‘you always wanted me dead’ and another said: ‘Mummy I love you goodbye. Miracle: Scarlett Straw, pictured after treatment on her left leg, was found barely alive on the trackside after the train hit her, but she has gone on to make a full recovery . A third, referring to Scarlett, said: ‘Get your own family, she’s mine.’ Miss Roberts then received a phone call from the police to tell her about the train incident. The inquest was told father-of-two Mr . Straw died from multiple injuries when he was hit by the Leeds-bound . express train on the East Coast main line near Doncaster at around . 12.30pm. Driver David Dobson said he saw a man run from undergrowth at the side of the track as he neared a crossing. ‘He looked straight at me and seemed to speed up. I could see he was carrying a girl. Injuries: Scarlett's cheekbone was fractured, one arm was broken and one leg was smashed by the blow, which also left her with a huge wound on the back of her head. But she survived after 45 days in hospital . ‘She was being carried on his left hip and had her arms around his neck and her head on his left shoulder. It was apparent he intended to jump straight in front of the train.’ Recording a suicide verdict, coroner . Nicola Mundy said: ‘It’s clear from the notes he left he simply couldn’t . accept the break-up of the relationship. 'This was a very deliberate act.’ At the scene: In a further chilling twist, it emerged Mr Straw had scrawled abusive graffiti over the walls of his former family home, including the words, 'good bye Sammy, good bye mummy' Determined: The train driver said Mr Straw was running as if 'he was running from some starting blocks' and as he saw the train he seemed to speed up .","Richard Straw, 28, died when he was hit by the train but his daughter .

A 14-year-old boy who was found hanging at his grandparents home is thought to be the latest victim of the 'fainting game'. Liam Hardy - who was about to become a father - was found unconscious at the home in Sutton. He was taken to the St George's Hospital in Tooting but died eight days later. As reported by the Evening Standard, it is feared he may have become another victim of the 'fainting game' - in which young people choke themselves to achieve a brief high. It is a craze which started in America and campaign groups say 86 people may have died in Britain as a result of the game. Warm tributes have already been paid to the youngster. A memorial has been set up in front of Carshalton Boys' Sports College which is covered in flowers and messages. Some of his friends at the school are also receiving counseling. His girlfriend Paige Ramsay is pregnant with their daughter. She has left a number of messages on a Facebook page which was set up in the teenager's memory. In one she said: 'Not long until our baby girl is here Liam. I can't wait to meet her so then I'm finally holding part of you again. 'I know I always said I was scared of giving birth but now I just don't care because then you'll finally be looking back at me again.' An inquest into the teenager's death has been opened and adjourned and the Metropolitan Police are not treating the death as suspicious. He died last Tuesday. Liam's mother, Janine Hardy, told the . Sutton Guardian: 'Liam was, and still is, my world - both my sons are. He was, and still is, very much loved by all his family and the many . other people he came into contact with.

A psychiatric patient warned repeatedly that she would hurt someone shortly before stabbing a girl of 13 to death at random, a report revealed yesterday. Hannah Bonser, 26, was ‘almost invisible’ and her predictions that she would attack someone fell on deaf ears. In total 16 psychiatrists and 20 community workers were involved in her care over the years. Hannah Bonser, who was jailed for a minimum of 22 years, was 'almost invisible' to some groups, despite being in and out of mental health care since 2002 . They and mental health nurses ‘missed . opportunities’ to help Bonser and change her life for the better, said a . damning independent review of her treatment. It highlighted bad decisions, inept . leadership, inadequate information-sharing and an ‘overly-optimistic’ attitude by the professionals. Bonser was jailed for a minimum of 22 . years at Sheffield Crown Court in July after being convicted of . murdering Casey Kearney, a total stranger. The drug-addicted loner plunged a . kitchen knife into the teenager’s chest without warning as she walked . through a park in Doncaster on the way to a half-term sleepover with a . friend. Bonser, whose mental health problems . were linked to years of cannabis abuse, had been involved with care . agencies for 19 years because of a troubled upbringing. As her mental state worsened in the . weeks before the murder, she repeatedly warned she could be a danger. She told two charity workers who assessed her at home she had a ‘short . fuse and anger issues’. She warned that she was a danger to . others and one day would ‘blow up’. However, the housing charity staff . failed to share the information with mental health workers involved in . her treatment and concluded there had been ‘no direct threats’ to . herself or another person. Stabbed at random: Casey Kearney was stabbed to death in a park after Bonser was allowed to remain free . Bonser also told hospital staff she . was ‘criminally insane’ and was going to harm herself or someone else. She said she needed to be locked up. Three days later she told a . psychiatrist that ‘seven people were trapped inside her body’ adding . that ‘some of them were psychopathic, some looked down on people, some . do not like children’. Despite these warnings she was allowed to return to her flat and was visited by a ‘home treatment team’. On January 16, less than a month . before the Valentine’s Day murder, Bonser told a mental health nurse she . should not be around other people because she wanted to kill them. She . said she had bad thoughts every day and therefore tried to stay away . from people on the street. Incredibly, the home treatment team . ‘discharged’ Bonser from its care two weeks later when there was . evidence her condition had actually deteriorated. The independent inquiry concluded . that this showed she was not being ‘listened to’. It criticised the . constant changing of psychiatrists and the failure of anyone to take the . lead in her care. One consultant psychiatrist involved . in the final  key period was accused of assessment and care planning . ‘significantly below acceptable standards’. There was ‘no robust care . plan’ drawn up as her condition worsened alarmingly, said the report, . which did not name any of the culprits. Jailed: Bonser was told she must serve a minimum of 22 years in jail when she was sentenced at Sheffield Crown Court (pictured) Bonser was referred to as ‘Miss G’ in . the 146-page report written by Professor Pat Cantrill, a senior . Department of Health official. ‘Everybody knew a little about Miss G, but nobody had the full picture,’ he said. Professor Cantrill studied the . actions of ten agencies and made 21 recommendations. Although he made it . clear that Bonser was responsible for Casey’s death, he concluded: ‘She . told many agencies of her concern that she was going to harm someone. ‘Assessments made by them did not identify a high level of risk of this occurring.’ Bonser told Professor Cantrill she . felt people ‘did not listen or take her seriously’ and that she ‘asked . to be locked up as she was afraid that she might hurt someone’. Bonser . said ‘professional egos got in the way of providing the help she needed . and she was always sent home’. Christine Bain, chief executive of . Rotherham Doncaster and South Humber NHS Foundation Trust, said action . had been taken to implement the recommendations. ‘We acknowledge that . our service to Miss Bonser should have been much better.’","Hannah Bonser 'almost invisible' to some agencies .

Caring: Shannon was a 'loving and absolutely fantastic daughter' A teenager who had been prescribed a contraceptive pill to clear up her acne died after suffering a blood clot, an inquest heard yesterday. Hours before her death, Shannon Deakin, 16, had gone to an out-of-hours surgery with ‘knife-like’ pains in her thigh. She saw a newly-qualified locum GP, Dr Karim Mohammed, who excluded deep vein thrombosis as a cause and gave her antibiotics instead. He told Shannon to see her family doctor within two days if she wasn’t feeling better, but she died 12 hours later. An inquest was told the midwifery student had been prescribed the oral contraceptive Dianette by her GP. The pill is known to carry a higher risk of developing blood clots compared to similar pills. Shannon had been taking the Pill for a month before coming off it four weeks before she died on December 4 last year. A post-mortem examination showed she died from a pulmonary embolism caused by a blood clot moving from her leg to her chest, which the pathologist described as ‘extremely rare’. Consultant haematologist Dr Rhona Maclean told the hearing that the risk of Shannon developing a thrombosis from taking  Dianette was ‘very low’. But she said: ‘It would be at its highest in the first six months of taking the Pill.’ During the month Shannon was taking Dianette, the risk of having a thrombosis was estimated to be ‘15 to 25 in every 100,000’. Her GP had prescribed the Pill after the teenager complained of acne on her back, chest and face. The inquest at Sheffield was told Dr Mohammed was on call at the walk-in clinic in Barnsley Hospital when Shannon came in complaining of pain from her abdomen to her groin. Dianette: Women taking a contraceptive pill are more likely to develop blood clots . Because she had been on the Pill for only a short time, he did not ask any further questions and excluded DVT from his diagnosis. ‘I explained it was highly unlikely that it was a clot and my findings were more of an infection or muscular pain,’ he said. Shannon later collapsed on the sofa of her home in Hoyland, South Yorkshire. Her father Bryan, 58, tried to revive her but she was declared dead in hospital. Her mother, Susan, 43, said: ‘She was a very caring person, very  outgoing, loving, an absolutely  fantastic daughter and had such generosity towards everyone else. ‘She wanted a career as a midwife and wanted children. You couldn’t ask for a better daughter.’ Dr James Gray, who carried  out an independent review, said because Shannon had been off the Pill for four weeks the risk associated with Dianette was likely to  be ‘very small’. He said: ‘It is known to be slightly higher risk than other pills, but in Shannon’s case we have no known risk factors.’ Commenting on the locum doctor’s treatment, he said: ‘It may have been prudent to arrange a scan that day but I do not believe the overall assessment was in itself unreasonable.’ Asked if he had taken into account all known risk factors for DVT, Dr Gray replied: ‘I remain unconvinced that is the case.’ The hearing continues. Risks: Women are more at risk of a blood clot if they smoke, are overweight or have diabetes . Dianette, which has the medical name cyproterone acetate, works by suppressing the action of testosterone on the body's tissues.It is also used as a hormone therapy in men undergoing sex change treatment, as well as in tackling early onset puberty. The NHS website said Dianette is only used to treat acne when previous treatments have not been successful. Women are more at risk of a blot clot if they smoke, have polycystic ovary syndrome, are seriously overweight, recently had a baby, have high blood pressure or diabetes or conditions such as Crohn's disease. The NHS warns women taking the pill to be wary of signs including migraines for the first time, pain or swelling in legs, stabbing pain when they breathe, pain in the chest or sudden changes to eyesight or hearing.","Shannon Deakin stopped taking the Dianette pill four weeks before her death .

A carer who stole the savings of an Alzheimer’s sufferer she was looking after and avoided punishment by pretending to have cancer was jailed for 17 months yesterday. Lisa Whitehead, 41, twice conned courts with her fake pancreatic cancer condition. She was sentenced to do unpaid work for the theft but avoided doing it by convincing the authorities she was having chemotherapy. Lisa Whitehead, 41, pretended to have cancer in order to avoid going to court - and 'suffered a fit' (above) during a previous sentencing at Hull Crown Court . Mrs Whitehead, of Market Weighton, was initially exposed as a three-time fraudster in 2009 after forging a prescription for drugs, scamming benefits, and then stealing £7,000 from an Alzheimer's sufferer . Later she lied again to a judge to try to stop her home being repossessed. When her cancer condition was exposed . as a sham she failed to turn up in court on five occasions in 60 days, . making further false claims about her health and getting herself . admitted to hospital to avoid being sentenced for her latest crime. The judge at Hull Crown Court became . so exasperated by her lies and behaviour he even ordered police to . arrest her in hospital if necessary. Lisa Whitehead is seen leaving court in 2009 after being given a suspended prison sentence . Passing sentence, Judge Mark Bury told . her: ‘It seems to me that you have a streak of dishonesty running . through you like a stick of Blackpool rock. You told the courts that you . had pancreatic cancer and were undergoing chemotherapy. This was not . true.’ Whitehead, of Market Weighton, East . Yorkshire, was given nine months behind bars when the judge implemented . the suspended jail sentence for the original theft offence. He added a . consecutive eight-month term for perverting the course of justice by . lying in court about her cancer. Whitehead’s shameless behaviour began . when she stole £7,000 from a 91-year-old with Alzheimer’s over a . six-month period while working as her carer. She was given a suspended . jail sentence, told to do 250 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay . £1,000 costs after admitting theft at Hull Crown Court in 2010. Whitehead, who has a previous . conviction for benefit fraud, told probation workers she had pancreatic . cancer and avoided doing her community work. She used her fake cancer condition as . an excuse again when taken to Hull County Court by a housing association . for being £1,700 behind on her rent. Whitehead forged a doctor’s note – . writing in felt tip ‘Lisa has cancer and is a very poorly lady’ – to try . to avoid losing her home. The district judge saw through the ruse and . Whitehead was evicted. She was charged with perverting the . course of justice over the county court forgery and admitted the charge, . but delayed her inevitable prison sentence by repeatedly feigning . illness to avoid turning up at Hull Crown Court. Whitehead appeared in custody in Hull Crown Court (pictured) for sentence after admitting to charges of perverting the course of justice and failing to surrender . After the second missed hearing police . went to hospital – where Whitehead had been admitted for tests – and . were under orders to arrest her on the ward if necessary. However, . because she was a patient officers let her stay in hospital. Three days later she turned up for the . third scheduled hearing two hours late. Whitehead asked for a glass of . water and collapsed in the public area outside the court room, . apparently having a fit. She was stretchered out of the . building by paramedics and taken by ambulance to Hull Royal Infirmary. She was released later that day having made a full recovery. The incident happened on Friday November 2 and the judge ordered her to appear again on the Monday with a doctor’s note. However, on the Sunday she went to . York Hospital and the judge was told the following day that she was . having a hernia operation. Eventually police arrested her and took her . to court for sentencing. Joanna Golding, defending, said . Whitehead had been ill at various times because of an ‘underlying . medical condition’ but ‘it was  not cancer’.","Lisa Whitehead, 41, had a medical note - written in felt tip - which read: 'Lisa has cancer and is a very poorly lady'

When orders for their award-winning pies took off, a family bakery business urgently tried to recruit more staff. They offered decent pay rates and a permanent job. The only skills boss Roger Topping asked for were ‘common sense and a work ethic’. But what followed has left Mr Topping ‘frustrated, bewildered and shocked’ and more convinced than ever that reforms to the benefits system can’t come soon enough. Frustrated: Roger Topping of Topping Pie company in Doncaster, is struggling to get new employees to work in his factory and bakery due to a poor work ethic . For it soon became clear that the recruits who turned up at the Topping Pie Company in Doncaster weren’t interested in a job. Ministers plan to bring in a Universal Credit payment to simplify the benefits system to ensure those who take a job don’t lose out financially. Last night Mr Topping criticised the way the current system rewards the workshy. ‘They don’t want to work and more to the point they don’t have to work,’ he said. One young man lasted just two minutes into his first shift before he walked out. The company gave another 22-year-old, who had been to prison, the chance to turn his life around. But after two weeks doing a packing job, he stopped coming in and decided ‘he couldn’t cope with working’. Another applicant was a middle-aged man who put on his CV that he had just served a long prison term for aggravated burglary, was a member of the BNP and suffered from a bad back. The company's freshly made pies are sold in supermarkets and upmarket delis across the country (file picture) ‘I assume he put all that down to make sure he didn’t get a job,’ said Mr Topping, 64. The pie company has seen its order book almost double in value since the spring. Their freshly-made pies are sold in supermarkets across the country, as well as Selfridges, Fenwicks and numerous upmarket delis and farm shops. Yet despite a recruitment drive, their 34-strong permanent workforce is slightly down on what is was six months ago. The only way the company has been able to fulfil its orders is by overworked staff doing even more hours than before. Lazy: Mr Topping criticsed the way the current system rewards the workshy . Management want to hire ten workers in the bakery and packing departments, but it is proving an almost impossible task. The unemployed of Doncaster – of which there are officially 18,100 – don’t seem up for the job. Mr Topping, whose father started the company as a butcher’s in 1960, said: ‘I don’t think this is a local problem, it’s a national problem. We all know the system is wrong. ‘It would appear to be too easy not to have to go to work to earn a living and to pay the bills. How are they paying their bills? ‘From an employer’s situation it’s extremely frustrating. The work ethic is sadly lacking.’ Mr Topping said he used local agencies to hire staff, who are given a pay rise and taken on permanently if all goes well after a short trial period. ‘I don’t care what background they come from I just want good, honest hard-workers,’ he said. ‘We are a family business and our staff are not just numbers, they are people. If the company is successful, they keep a job and we all prosper.’ However, Wendy McMahon, the supervisor who sifted through dozens of CVs, said usually the raw recruits complain after a few days about having to do proper work hours. ‘They always seem keen and committed to the job and then we start getting excuses. All they need is to be willing to learn and do a hard day’s work. ‘We tell them they have a future here and can move up the ladder, they just don’t seem interested.’ It’s not the first time the business has faced recruitment problems. Mr Topping took on six Poles several years ago because vacancies were left empty and has been delighted with their work ethic. ‘The problem seems to be with the long-term unemployed,’ he said.","Roger Topping offers decent pay and a permanent job .

First steps: Two-year old Adalynn Willett leaves the Texas hospital for the first time since she was born 850 days ago after battling a rare condition where her liver and intestines were outside her body . Going home: Adalynn, with her parents Serafina Sevallos and Bryan Willett prepares to head to the family's home in Abilene for the first time . She took her first steps outside the hospital on Tuesday with her family by her side and headed home to Abilene. The child's mother Serafina Sevallos was overcome with emotion as she carried her daughter in a purple, sparkly dress from the ward. When doctors discovered Adalynn's . condition while she was still in the womb, they estimated she may have to . spend the first few months of her life in hospital. The birth defect causes the baby's abdominal organs to stick out of the belly button. Between 25-40 per cent of babies with an Omphalocele have other defects including genetic and heart problems. Once the child is born, surgery takes place to repair the Omphalocele. The organs are covered with a man-made pouch which is stitched in place and they are gradually pushed back into the body. Children are expected to make a full recovery following the procedure. Giant omphalocele is extremely rare and affects one in every 10,000 babies. Adalynn has had her heart stop twice in the course of her treatment and battled many infections. Although the toddler still has a way to go, she is expected to lead a normal life. At the moment, she as a tracheotomy to offset pressure put on her lungs by her intestines.

A father who struggled to come to terms with the loss of his daughter was found dead 18 months after her passing, with a note saying he needed to be with his princess, an inquest heard. Paul Dyer, 42, never accepted the death of his 13-year-old daughter Molly, who died from a severe allergic reaction to nuts from eating a curry in August 2010. Mr Dyer was found by staff at the Premier Inn in Prestwich, Bury, in March this year with a note which read: ‘I love you all but I need to be with my princess, love Paul.’ Molly, from Whitefield, Bury, died after going into anaphylactic shock and suffering an asthma attack as a result of eating a chicken tikka masala from a local takeaway. Her devastated father, a pharmaceutical manager, sat beside her grave almost every day after she died, Rochdale Coroner’s Court heard. Mr Dyer was found in the hotel room with prescription drugs, alcohol, and a series of notes to family members, including the apology. Photographs of Molly were also found in the room, the inquest was told. His body was found by a housekeeper who saw a note pinned to a chair which read: ‘Please be careful with me. I have just killed myself. Sorry you have found me like this.’ His brother, Darren Dyer, told the inquest that Paul had a chair positioned at Molly’s graveside. Darren, from Eccles, Salford, said: ‘He always put Molly first, no matter what. ‘Molly’s death had a devastating effect on all our lives. Paul never, never came to terms with her death. When Molly died, Paul died with her to be honest.’ Mr Dyer said his brother changed after her death and added: ‘He absolutely worshipped and adored his daughter. After her funeral he spent almost every day at her grave. He had a chair there whether it was raining or sunshine. He spent hours there.’ His mother, Margaret Dyer, aged 70, said: 'Paul couldn’t live without Molly. He tried his best, but he couldn’t cope without her. It was too much for him. 'They were best friends and he took it very hard when she died,' she told Bury Times at the time of her sons passing. 'He idolised her and said she was his princess.' Molly, who had dreamed of becoming a professional dancer, was diagnosed . with a peanut allergy at the age of three but managed her condition with the help of her family. Tragic scene: Mr Dyer was found dead by staff at this Premier Inn in Prestwich, Greater Manchester, with a note saying he needed to be with 'his princess' The teenager was attending a party with her mother Meryl Matthews where friends had ordered the Indian takeaway from a local restaurant. After eating the chicken tikka masala curry, she collapsed in front of her mother and was rushed to hospital. Despite medical staff fighting for four hours, they were unable to save the teenager's life. An inquest into Molly’s death heard she had eaten the dish twice the previous week while on holiday with her father. Mr Dyer, who suffered from asthma, lived in Macclesfield where he worked for pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. He was seeing a counsellor at the time of his death and was on prescribed sleeping tablets. Coroner Simon Nelson, noted that Mr Dyer had an undiagnosed heart disease and recorded a narrative verdict, but said he believed that he had booked into the hotel intent on taking his life. Mr Nelson said: ‘It must have been extraordinarily difficult for him and the whole myriad of emotions he was going through. ‘I do believe that his death was a combination of natural and unnatural factors.’ Anaphylactic shock, or anaphylaxis, is an extreme allergic reaction, most commonly to foods, insect stings or drugs . Anaphylaxis sees rapid chemical changes in the body causing breathing difficulties and dramatic swelling – mainly of the face and neck.

New laws may be needed to ‘civilise the internet’, protect private lives and prevent ‘mob rule’, Lord Justice Leveson has suggested. The judge, speaking in public for the first time since his 2,000-page report into the Press was published, launched a broadside against the prospect of people facing ‘trial by Twitter’. Critics have suggested that the Leveson report’s recommendations risk shackling a shrinking print media while doing nothing to address a ‘Wild West’ online culture in which innocent people’s reputations are trashed every day. Speaker: During a £620-per-ticket lecture in Sydney last night Lord Justice Leveson said 'mob rule' online needed to be dealt with .

Only one short chapter of the report . tackles ‘alternative news sources’, including broadcasters and the . internet. Only one-and-a-half pages are devoted to issues of . ‘enforcement’ raised by the web. Lord Justice Leveson said there was a . perception ‘on the internet that actions do not have legal . consequences’, unlike newspapers which must follow the rules. One of the abuses he mentioned was . the publication of topless photos of the Duchess of Cambridge in a . French magazine, which were not printed in the British Press but could . be easily viewed online. 'Unmissable': Lord Justice Leveson was among a host of experts to speak at the day-long symposium, billed as 'one of the key privacy events of the year' Example: A hoax phone call to Kate's bedside (pictured leaving hospital) was an example of the need for new privacy laws, Lord Leveson said . Lord Justice Leveson was the keynote . speaker at a conference on privacy and the internet in Australia, where . he travelled soon after the publication of his report last week.

He told . guests paying £620 each that he was monitoring developments in London . ‘with interest’ but refused to comment any further on his most . contentious recommendation for a new watchdog to be underpinned by law. However, he did finally address the . problems posed by the internet, which he called a ‘global megaphone for . gossip’, saying online allegations cause ‘permanent’ damage as they . remain in cyberspace. The judge suggested there was ‘an . element of mob rule’ – seemingly referring to false allegations against . Tory peer Lord McAlpine that emerged following a report on the BBC’s . Newsnight programme. ‘The established media broadly . conforms to the law and, when they do not, they are potentially liable . under the law,’ he said. ‘In so far as the internet is concerned, there . has been – and for many there remains – a perception that actions do not . have legal consequences. 'There is not only a danger of trial by . Twitter, but also of an unending punishment, and no prospect of . rehabilitation, by Google.’ His remarks, at the University of . Technology in Sydney, came as newspaper editors announced they had . agreed to put in place the broad principles of his report for a tough . new regulator, with the power to issue fines of up to £1million, order . the publication of prominent apologies and investigate alleged . wrongdoing – but without involving statute.

He says the male and female security guards  took him to a boys toilet where they told him they had received an anonymous tip and were looking for drugs. The Chicago police officer put him against the wall of a bathroom stall with his back against them. Abused: The boy, interviewed anonymously, claims he was asked to pull down his pants after which his privates were searched for drugs in front of the female assistant principal . ‘He searched me with my clothes on,’ the boy told CBS2. ‘Then he told me to remove my belt. As I undid my belt he pulled my pants and underwear down to my knees and then started grabbing and searching my privates.’ No drugs were found on the boy. The teen has a history of suspensions and bad behaviour and he requires special education due to ‘emotional disorder’ and a learning disability diagnosed by the school. A spokeswoman for Chicago Public School said their policy is that ‘under no circumstances are strip searches of students allowed on CPS premises’ and that their school policy manual prohibits ‘washroom searches.’ His parents’ lawsuit claims that the boy’s civil rights were violated and that the search was carried out without cause. School strip: The boy claims he was strip-searched by two security guards at William Howard Taft High School in Chicago whilst serving an 'in-house suspension' at the school . ‘No one should go through what our son went through,’ his mother said, whilst Mr Woodman added: ‘There needs to be consequences for what they did to him.’ Julie Herrera, the Woodman’s attorney called the search outrageous. ‘Having a 15-year-old boy have to have a woman – an older woman – watch him with his pants down, while he is touched by another man. I think is horribly humiliating and embarrassing.’ Michelle Woodman said her son’s behaviour has changed dramatically and that he has taken to sleeping with his clothes on and suffers from nightmares. His mother said the experience was humiliating for her son, and that it has adversely affected him. ‘He is very withdrawn and very angry. He’s depressed. He is just not the same person,’ she said in the CBS2 interview. Chicago Public Schools and the Chicago Police Department declined to comment on an on-going investigation.","Boy, 15, claim he was dragged out of detention for strip-search .

Naked protestors stormed San Francisco City Hall to show their anger after a controversial ban on public nudity was narrowly approved by city bosses. Yesterday San Francisco sheriffs were forced to cover up the bare activists who stripped off their clothes during a San Francisco Board of Supervisors meeting at San Francisco City Hall, California. The board voted to pass legislation that will amend the city's police code to ban nudity on city streets, plazas, sidewalks and other public spaces. Nudity during permitted parades, fairs and festivals will still be allowed. Scroll down for video . Modesty: A deputy rushes to cover a nude woman during the San Francisco Board of Supervisors meeting. She was protesting new nudity legislation in the city . Arrest: Under new legislation, nudists can be fines or even imprisoned for multiple offences . Slim margin: The legislation narrowly passed, sparking the naked protest . About a half dozen angry protesters stripped down to their socks but sheriff's deputies quickly covered up the demonstrators and led them from the majestic beaux-arts chamber. Protesters, one wearing only rainbow knee socks and another sporting black nylons, chanted, 'body freedom' and 'shame on you' as they were escorted out. Some residents and business owners say nudists, and specifically a group known as the Naked Guys, have gone too far with their constant presence at a square in the Castro District. But nudists claim a right to bare all and say politicians in San Francisco, which has often celebrated the bizarre and unconventional, should leave them alone. San Francisco lawmakers narrowly . approved the proposal to ban public nakedness, rejecting arguments that . the measure would eat away at a reputation for tolerance enjoyed by a . city known for flouting convention and flaunting its counter-culture . image. Brazen: A nude woman stands in front of San Francisco Supervisors during the meeting. Nudity during permitted parades, fairs and festivals will still be allowed . The 6-5 Board of Supervisors vote . means that exposed genitals will be prohibited in most public places, . including streets, sidewalks and public transit. Scott Wiener, a city supervisor representing the Castro District, introduced the proposal which would stop backsides and genitals being exposed in public. 'This has been a very difficult issue, a lot of strong views on both sides,' Wiener told Reuters after the vote. 'But it was an issue that needed to be addressed, and I addressed it in a very narrow way.' The ban would prohibit most nudity in public, but it would continue to allow marchers at special events, like the San Francisco Pride Parade, to bare all. Children under 5 can be naked in public and sunbathers can continue to strip down on nude beaches. A San Francisco Sheriff's Deputy removes a nude protester. San Francisco last year began requiring nudists to cover their buttocks in public and to wear clothes in restaurants . California state law prohibits indecent exposure, but law enforcement must show evidence of lewd behaviour rather than simple nudity. A number of cities, including San Jose and Berkeley, already have nudity bans, Wiener said. Four nudists, including a former San Francisco mayoral candidate, have filed suit challenging the ban. Attorney Christina DiEdoardo, who represents the plaintiffs, says the city is depriving nudists of their constitutional rights to free speech and equal protection. 'Now the city is going to have to spend considerable time and money to defend an ordinance that didn't have to be passed,' DiEdoardo said. San Francisco last year required nudists to cover the surfaces they sit on in public places and to wear clothes in restaurants. Residents say the restrictions spurred defiant exhibitionism. Violators under the city's nudity ban would be fined up to $100 for a first offense and $200 for a second. Three-time offenders would face up to a year in jail and a $500 fine.

Furious Russian politicians accused America of Cold War tactics for passing a law barring any of its officials suspected of human rights abuses from the US. Tensions between the superpowers were reginited yesterday after US senators passed a new bill that included the Magnitsky Act. The act is named after Sergei Magnitsky, an anti-corruption lawyer who died in a Russian jail in 2009. It is claimed Mr Magnitsky had been tortured and was denied hospital treatment prior to his death. Financier Bill Browder poses beside a picture of his former lawyer Sergei Magnitsky . He was arrested in 2008 while investigating a £143m fraud by Russian tax and police officials. Mr Magnitsky was hired to investigate the fraud by financier Bill Browder, who has since campaigned for justice him. The new bill will see Russian officials accused of human rights abuses banned from getting visas, and also aims to freeze the assets of those involved in Mr Magnitsky's death. But Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov condemned it and claimed his country would retaliate by barring US officials accused of the same abuses. Speaking after a meeting with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Dublin last week, he said: 'We will also close entry to Americans who are guilty of human rights violations.' The government department he oversees also attacked the bill on Twitter, saying it was from the 'theatre of the absurd' and would 'adversely affect the prospects of bilateral co-operation.' US Secretary of State has incurred the wrath of Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov over the bill . The tweets continued: 'Apparently, Washington has forgotten what year this is and still thinks the cold war is going on. 'It is perplexing and preposterous to hear human rights complaints from the US, where torture and kidnapping are legal in the 21st century. 'This biased approach is nothing but a vindictive desire to counter Russia in world affairs.' Angry Kremlin officials also coralled the Young Guard youth wing of the ruling United Russia party to protest. It's spokesman Maxim Rudnev said:'The US positions itself as a country of freedom. 'And yet, the American leadership is itself infringing upon the freedom of citizens of another country. 'It's worth asking: is the United States deserving of hosting the Statue of Liberty?' And Media boss Margarita Simonyan, who runs state-run news channel Russia today also attacked America's behaviour. She said: 'And now they'll shut down entry to Russia for some American officials who are involved, let's say, in the death of Afghan kids. 'What are they going to do, cry?' The criticism came despite a poll showing 39 per cent of Russians supported the US law, compared to just 14 per cent who opposed it.","Anger as US passes law named after anti-corruption lawyer .

A dog walker made a rare discovery when he found a six stone fish the size of a child washed up on the beach near his home. Matt Hyde, 44, was walking his Labrador Jimmy along The Sandilands beach near Sutton-on-Sea, Lincolnshire when he nearly tripped over the blob-like creature. The find was even more unusual than he thought as it turned out to be a a Mola mola, or Ocean sunfish, which normally lives thousands of miles away in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Rare guest: The mola mola sunfish is normally found in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean . Mr Hyde brought the giant sunfish home and contacted marine experts who told him the significance of his find. The Mola mola has previously been spotted washed up on Cornish beaches but never before has one been discovered on the English east coast. Although it weighed six stone, this is considered very little for an Ocean sunfish which can grow to be 14ft (4.2m) long and 10ft (3.1m) wide and weigh a whopping 5,000lbs, or 357 stone. Mr Hyde said: ‘Whilst taking Jimmy for a walk on the beach, he was tugging at something on the shoreline. When I went up to see what he had found, I couldn’t believe my eyes. ‘At first I thought it was a dead seal and nearly tripped over it, but as soon I realised it was a fish I knew it was something I have never seen before. Large haul: The sunfish found by Mr Hyde in Sutton-on-sea weighs six stone . Fetched fish: Mr Hyde found the sunfish when he was walking his black Labrador Jimmy , right, on the Sandilands beach near Sutton-on-sea . Big baby: Although this specimen tipped the scales at six stone it is considered a tiny one for the mola molas who can weigh up to 357 stone when fully grown . ‘To me, the fish looked somewhat prehistoric, but after doing some research I discovered it was a Mola mola sunfish.' Although they don’t have tails, the ocean-dwellers can still jump clear of the water. In January this year another Mola mola was found on the beach in seaside resort Margate in Kent. This was followed by a 35ft sperm whale which was discovered 14 miles from Sandilands at Skegness Pier in April. In 2011 a 55ft fin whale washed up on the beach in Lynmouth, Devon, which normally lives far away in the North Atlantic. In 2008 an extremely rare 12ft Sowerby's beaked whale and a baby Risso's dolphin were found within days of each other on the western shores of St Agnes on the Isles of Scilly. They have been known to be spotted along the west coast of Britain but it is extremely rare to find one on the east. Andy Horton, director of the British Marine Life Study Society, said: 'It is rare and unusual to get sunfish in the North Sea. ‘They are mainly found in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and the furthest I’m ever seen them go is the Cornish coast. ‘So for it to navigate around Scotland . like that is quite remarkable. For it to be washed up like that is even . rarer as the prevailing winds would usually propel it away from land. ‘I have heard of sightings in Irish and Welsh waters but on an English beach on the east coast is rare.’ Sunfish develop their truncated, bullet-like shape because the back fin which they are born with never grows. Instead, it folds into itself as the enormous creature matures, creating a rounded rudder called a clavus. Mola in Latin means ‘millstone’ and describes the ocean sunfish’s somewhat circular shape.

A nationwide manhunt has been launched today to find a teenager who breached a 'gang-bo' injunction. Leevon Birchall, 19, was one of the first people to be given a 12-month gang injunction in Greater Manchester, which banned him from contacting known associates following a police investigation into into a vicious tit-for-tat gun war. However, just 48 hours after the court order was imposed, Birchall posted snaps of himself posing defiantly with a teenage friend named in the legal papers. Breached: Birchall, front middle, is pictured at a club with Jacob Harrison, left, which was posted on October 28 - breaching the so-called 'Gang-bo' Taunt: Birchall last took to Twitter on November 14, pictured, where he said he had been across the country despite being subjected to a curfew . Birchall, who was also placed under curfew and barred from contacting any individuals linked to the city's criminal underworld, posted messages taunting police such 'we live the diamond life' and 'f*** the system'. In the latest message, posted on November 14, he wrote: 'I'm all over the country been wales warrington blackpool and now im on my way to london.' In another he posted to his 940 followers he wrote: 'police just take the ****out of my life.' And a third reads: '****** police are scumbags trying to say I wasn't in my house at ten when I was the ******.' At a hearing on Monday, Birchall, from Salford, Greater Manchester, was sentenced to 84 days imprisonment in his absence and is now wanted by police. Officers say they are closing in on the fugitive. He was initially arrested in September along with three other men following a zero tolerance campaign by police against two feuding gangs. It came after six underworld shootings on homes and cars in just 20 days. On . October 10, Birchall and Jacob Harrison, also 19, plus other suspects . Kane Stafford, 21, and Carne Thomasson, 22, were barred by a judge from . venturing onto the turf of gangland rivals under the terms of a civil . order.

Hunt: Leevon Birchall has taunted police through Twitter with messages such as 'f*** the system' and posts bragging he has been travelling freely across the country . The injunctions are not criminal convictions but anyone caught breaching the injunction faces up to two years in prison. Detective Chief Inspector Chris Downey from Greater Manchester Police said today: 'The whole purpose of the injunction is to ensure communities stay safe, by restricting people’s ability take part in any gang-related activity. 'He has breached this civil order and been sentenced for it so he needs to be taken to prison to serve his time. 'We know Birchall has links across Salford and I need to remind people that anyone helping him evade capture may be arrested for perverting the course of justice. 'We also know that Birchall has a large number of followers on Twitter so he needs to know that we will be appealing to them to tell us where he is.' The turf war broke out in September following a petty dispute between the two gangs which is thought to have arisen out of a minor 'respect' argument. A window of a car was shot at in a suburban street and later armed police were called to two separate shooting incidents when bullets were fired into houses.

Street-wise city birds are keeping their nests warm and pest-free by lining them with cigarette butts, research has shown. The nicotine and other chemicals in discarded filters act as a natural pesticide that repels parasitic mites. At the same time, the cellulose butts provide useful nest insulation. Researchers discovered that birds, including house sparrows, are lining their nests with discarded cigarette butts . Wild birds are known to protect their nests from mite invasion by importing certain chemical-emitting plants. The new evidence suggests some birds species in the urban jungle have adapted the same behaviour to harness the repellent properties of tobacco. Scientists in Mexico City studied nests of house sparrows and house finches that each contained, on average, about 10 used cigarette butts. The number of stubbed-out cigarettes incorporated into the nests ranged from none to as many as 48. In both species, nests with larger numbers of butts were significantly less infested by mites. To test the parasite-repelling effect, the researchers attached cellulose fibres from smoked and non-smoked filters to thermal traps placed in nests. The battery-operated traps attract mites by generating heat. Fewer parasites were drawn to traps laced with nicotine-laden smoked butts. Dr Constantino Macias Garcia, from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and his team wrote in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters: 'We provide evidence that urban birds incorporate cellulose from smoked cigarette butts into the nest and that this behaviour entails a reduction in the number of nest-dwelling ectoparasites. The team say the birds use the butts to provide warmth to chicks because of its insulating properties, and because nicotine works as an insecticide . 'It appears that this effect may be due to the fact that mites are repelled by nicotine, perhaps in conjunction with other substances, because thermal traps laced with cellulose from smoked butts attracted fewer ectoparasites than traps laced with non-smoked cellulose. 'This novel behaviour observed in urban birds fulfils one of the three conditions necessary to be regarded as self-medication: it is detrimental to parasites.' Nicotine is a natural defence chemical used by the tobacco plant to ward off plant-eating insects, the researchers pointed out. It had been used to protect crops from pests and also to control parasites in poultry. The scientists said it was possible the anti-mite nest protection was a happy coincidence. Birds might only be lining their nests with discarded butts because they provide good insulation. Further studies could reveal if this is the case by offering the birds a choice of smoked and non-smoked butts. Either would do for insulation, but only filters from smoked cigarettes can effectively repel mites. 'Birds could distinguish smoked and non-smoked butts from their scent, just as some birds that use the chemical compounds of plants as defence against parasites appear to rely on olfaction to collect those with effective chemicals,' the scientists wrote.","Nicotine acts as an insecticide, while fibres provide insulation .

Wanted: Sgt James Reading is the target of a global manhunt after he . groped four teenagers and then went on the run . An international manhunt is underway for a paedophile Air Training Corps sergeant who fled the country after abusing female cadets. Sgt James Reading was found guilty in his absence of groping four teenagers while on night exercises and at illegal underage drinking parties at his squadron hut in Okehampton, North Devon. He was today jailed for ten years at Exeter Crown Court as police resumed the search for the fugitive, who has been on the run since jumping bail in June. Reading was the NCO in day-to-day charge of a group of 30 cadets, but used his position to assault four girl cadets, aged 14 to 16, in 2011. He abused one girl during a sleepover party he organised at the ATC hut on the night before a Remembrance Day parade and assaulted another after telling her she may be promoted if she went on night exercises with him. He plied his victims with alcohol at the unofficial parties at the ATC hut where he hid his activities by putting bin bags over the windows as makeshift curtains. The sergeant invited boys to the parties but sent them on errands or into different rooms while he was carrying out his attacks. He offered one girl £50 to touch her breast and was caught red-handed when one female cadet burst into the hut’s kitchen to find him with a topless, terrified and hysterical 14-year-old. Reading, 35, of Plymouth, denied eight offences of sexual activity with a child or inciting a child to take part in sexual activity but was found guilty. The offences related to a 14-year-old and two 15-year-olds. He was cleared of sexually assaulting another 16-year-old cadet after the jury heard he may have believed she consented. And he was also cleared of an unrelated charge of raping a former girlfriend. He was jailed for ten years with a four-year extended licence and banned from having unsupervised contact with children indefinitely. Vulnerable: Female ATC cadets were attacked by Sgt James Reading during night exercises and illegal drinking parties (file picture) Judge Erik Salomonsen said: 'The ATC fulfils and important role in the community and parents must know they can rely on them to look after their children. 'It goes without saying this applies to their moral as well as their physical welfare and the highest standards should have been adhered to in relation to alcohol and the separation of the sexes during overnight activities. 'Adults must set an example and it is beyond belief that an NCO in such an organisation should be able to put himself in a position to abuse young cadets. 'He worked himself into a position of responsibility well beyond his abilities. 'He had an unhealthy interest in sex with young girls and was determined to satisfy himself in a wholly selfish way regardless of the views of those around him. 'In my judgment he is a dangerous man, particularly when in drink and in a position of responsibility with access to children.'After the case Detective Constable Chris Amey said the hunt for Reading will go on in this country and abroad. He said: 'We have already made extensive inquiries which and we may consider an appeal on Crimewatch. We have some evidence he has gone to France and we may involve international agencies.' The ATC is the RAF's cadet force, divided into six regions, 36 wings and more than 900 squadrons within communities around the UK. Its aim is to promote and encourage a practical interest in aviation and the Royal Air Force among young people, provide training and encourage 'the spirit of adventure' and the qualities of leadership and good citizenship. Cadets are offered the opportunity to fly planes, attend camps, take part in competitive sports and have a go at shooting, music, abseiling and engineering projects. An MOD spokesman said Reading has been dismissed from the organisation. He added: 'Safeguarding the welfare of cadets and volunteers in the Air Cadets Organisation is of paramount importance. 'Dedicated staff work to provide a safe and secure environment for all those involved with the ACO.'","ATC Sgt James Reading, 35, groped teenage cadets in his squadron hut in Okehampton .

A statue of an 'angel of hope' was erected in the Washington cemetery just feet from where Charlie and Braden Powell were buried after their father killed them- and himself- in a house explosion in February. A crime-fighting group used the donations they collected in the wake of the horrific double murder-suicide of the two young boys paid for the statue to be commissioned. The Powell family saga, however, drags on with little reason for hope as Charlie and Braden's grandparents still look for any clues relating to the disappearance of the boy's mother Susan. Reflecting: Chuck Cox, the boy's grandfather, pauses and looks at the statue erected in Charlie and Braden Powell's honor nearly nine months after they were killed by their father . Tragic: Susan Powell (right) disappeared in 2009 and her estranged husband Josh (top) killed himself and their two sons Charlie (left) and Braden (center) in a house explosion . Josh Powell was the main suspect in Susan's 2009 disappearance, since he told police that on that fateful night he decided to take the young boys on an impromptu camping trip in the dead of winter in a Nevada desert. His siblings have stayed in touch with Susan's parents, Chuck and Judy Cox. 'It is only a 15 minute drive from their home and right up on the hill above Charlie and Braden's plot and the plot where Susan will be buried when we find her,' Kirk Graves, Josh's brother-in-law, told Radar. The monument at Woodbine Cemetery in Puyallup, Washington near the Cox home was funded by Crime Stoppers and they dedicated it as a place of 'healing' for anyone who has lost a child in their lives. Common use: The memorial, funded for by donations to Crime Stoppers, was dedicated to all people who have lost children in their lives . Up the hill: The memorial was placed not far from the plot where the two boys are buried, and where Susan Powell will be buried if her body is ever found . As the family begins to go through their first holiday season without the two boys, they are also faced with another absence as the third anniversary of Susan's disappearance is Thursday. 'I have to hope that Josh told somebody something before he killed himself. It is hard to get really hopeful but at the same time there is a possibility that he spoke to his dad,' Graves said. Josh's dad, Steven, is the one link that remains as Josh lived with Steven for months between the time of Susan's disappearance and the day when Josh hacked his children to death during a court-ordered supervised visit before setting the house on fire with a gas explosion. Steven is in his own set of legal problems, however, as he has been arrested for two and a half years in jail for two counts of voyeurism. Tragedy: Powell blew up his Washington home, pictured, killing himself and the two young boys when they were dropped off for a supervised visit . Happier times: Susan Powell's parents, Chuck and Judy Cox, were living with her sons Charlie (left) and Braden (right) at the time of the horrific incident . Waiting for clues: Steven Powell, Josh's father, may know information about Susan's disappearance, but he refuses to talk and is in jail on different voyeurism charges . During his trial, he revealed that he had a sexual infatuation with Susan and had pictured her secretly at points over the years of his son's marriage. Even an impending jail sentence didn't sway Steven to reveal details about the whereabouts of her body- if he knows any. 'He won't talk to anyone right now, he won't respond to people who have put in an effort. I have a very low opinion of him and have for 16 years. I feel that if it serves his purpose he will talk but unless he gets something out if it then he has no reason to say anything,' Graves told Radar.","Josh Powell killed himself and his two sons Charlie and Braden in a home explosion in February during a court-ordered visit .

A 'deceitful' mother pretended to be dying of cancer so she could pocket hundreds of pounds raised for her by sympathetic workmates. Twisted Teresa Clay told 'lie after lie' to concerned colleagues and bosses at the manufacturing firm that employed her - and was given time off on full pay for bogus hospital treatment. The 42-year-old claimed she was suffering from throat cancer, and said she could only work mornings while undergoing radiotherapy. Cancer scam: Chesterfield magistrates court heard how Teresa Clay, 42, of Ripley, Derbys, told lie after lie to work colleagues with one even completing a ten-mile charity run which raised £300 . One friend at the company even completed a ten-mile charity run for her, raising £300, and others chipped in after Clay said she needed a dialysis machine for a fake kidney complaint. But the deception, which included a string of other lies including a claim she was being stalked by an ex-partner, was uncovered when she left for another job. Clay, of Ripley, Derbys, was reported to the police and admitted admitted fraud by making false claims that she was terminally ill when she appeared at Chesterfield Magistrates’ Court. The hearing was told she was paid £3,618 she wasn’t entitled to by Storm DFX in Alfreton, Derbys. The offences took place between August 2011 and May this year. Prosecutor Mike Treharne said: 'It’s a tale of deceit that’s really quite awful. 'The workforce were completely taken in by her deceit. Work colleagues took it upon themselves to do fund-raising. Clay was given a six month jail term, suspended for one year and ordered to do 200 hours unpaid work (file picture not of Clay) 'One did a ten-mile run and paid £300 to her. But there was no problem with her kidneys and she did not have cancer.' The court heard that by November last year, three months after she started her job, Clay had told bosses she could only take liquid food. She went on to claim that a former partner had thrown acid over her car, and it had blown up. She was given time off for non-existent cancer treatment, and her kind-hearted employers even hired her a car for four weeks while she claimed hers was being fixed. Magistrates imposed a six-month jail term, suspended for one year. They also ordered Clay to do 200 hours unpaid work, and pay £3,618 compensation to Storm DFX and £300 to the workmate she conned. Stacey White, defending, said Clay, who has no previous convictions, did not accept all the allegations but it was accepted it was 'a fairly despicable offence'. She told the court that at the time of the deception, Clay had debts that had 'spiralled out of control'. Ms White added: 'She regrets her actions every day. She feels embarrassed and ashamed. She hasn’t told her family.' The hearing was also told Clay, who lives with her teenage son and now works as a receptionist for the National Grid, was on medication for depression.","Teresa Clay, 42, claimed she was suffering from throat cancer and kidney failure .

After a three-year saga over the fate of the Olympic Stadium, it looks like it will become the new home of West Ham United. The east London football club have been named as the top choice to move in to the Olympic Stadium when it reopens, it was announced today . The London Legacy Development Corporation board (LLDC) unanimously made the decision in favour of the Premier League club ahead of rivals from Intelligent Transport Services in association with Formula One, UCFB College of Football Business and Leyton Orient. We're moving, lads: West Ham are ready to leave their Upton Park home . A new dawn: The Olympic Stadium is set to host football in the future . Tottenham Hotspur competed against rivals West Ham for the keys to the arena . LLDC chairman and London Mayor Boris Johnson said: 'We had four good bids, as everybody knows. 'The bid that has been ranked top is West Ham United. I am very pleased about that. West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady . 'It will, if it goes through, mean a . football legacy for the stadium but there is still a lot of negotiation . to go on between the LLDC and West Ham United about the terms of the . deal.' The choice of West Ham as tenants on a . 99-year lease came after a bitter drawn-out battle with other businesses over who would be chosen to have the tenancy of the 80,000 seat arena. Three men have been charged with fraud . after claims that Tottenham Hotspurs hired private investigators to snoop on . West Ham as the clubs battled over the Olympic Stadium. The . trio are alleged to have accessed telephone bills and other private . records of West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady illegally. They appeared before Westminster Magistrates Court on November 28, and had their case sent to Southwark Crown Court, where they are due to appear on February 1, 2013. The north London club denied putting officials under surveillance. There is still plenty of hard . talking to go on before West Ham move in, which is not likely to . be until the 2016-17 season if it happens. The decision for it to go to the club, which has long been regarded as inevitable because of . the lack of any other long-term financially viable options, comes with a . number of expected caveats. The Mayor, who did not elaborate during the two-hour meeting said: 'There’s a lot . of negotiations still to go on with West Ham. If we can’t do a deal, the . stadium will still have a fantastic future with plan B. 'But we have . plenty of time to get in a football solution by 2016-17.' The Barclays Premier League club, who . have offered £15million in cash plus a minimum £9m-a-year in rent and . share of commercial revenues to help pay for the renovation costs, must . also help to fill the funding gap in the building work  necessary to . transform a track and field venue into a multi-sports arena. Jessica Ennis competes in the long jump in the Olympic Stadium, Stratford - which could be now the home of West Ham . Britain's Mo Farah won the men's 5000m final at the Olympic Stadium, surrounded by thousands of cheering spectators . Decisions, decisions: London mayor Boris Johnson has been at the centre of plans . November 2010: West Ham and Tottenham Hotspur lead stadium bid . February 2011: West Ham win backing of Olympic bosses . April 2011: Spurs, Leyton Orient and an anonymous party launch legal bids over decision . October 2011: Government confirms collapse of West Ham bid . December 2011: Olympic bosses relaunch tender process . March 2012: Four bidders submit new proposals after 16 parties expressed an interest . July to August 2012: Stadium hosts Olympic and Paralympic Games . December 2012: Decision made on successful bidder . The hole in the projected £150m . finances necessary to install a new roof, retractable seating over the . running track and corporate boxes is now less than £20m. West . Ham believe the overall building costs could be less in the current . market with no tenders yet taking place for the work. West Ham, with partners Newham Council, . were initially successful in their bid for the stadium but the deal . collapsed in October 2011 after challenges from Tottenham Hotspurs and Leyton Orient . and an anonymous complaint to the European Commission. There is still the fear of a . fresh round of legal disputes over West Ham’s occupancy led by Leyton . Orient chairman Barry Hearn, whose bid for a groundshare was turned down . by the LLDC. Hearn, who fears that Orient will go . out of business within five years of West Ham moving into a stadium so close to the League One club, was waiting . until today’s verdict before deciding on whether to legally challenge . the decision in the courts. Newham Council's contributions of over . £60m to the funding adds to the complications. It was their original deal with . West Ham in 2011 that caused a legal wrangle, after a complaint was lodged to the European Parliament, claiming . that Newham’s financial assistance was an illegal subsidy. There is now a European Commission . investigating state aid in football, but the LLDC is confident . that the West Ham deal will pass the state aid test. Will the athletics track have to go?Not if the next generation of Mo Farahs and company are going to have something to run on in five years’ time. The stadium will host the 2017 World Athletics Championships after Lord Coe’s persuasive powers proved instrumental in bringing yet another major sporting event to London following the best Olympic Games in history.How will the seating work in such a large venue?Here’s where the money starts mounting up. A key part of West Ham’s bid is to retain the running track but they do not want fans match-day experience to suffer. The plan is to install retractable seating to slide over the running track to ensure Hammers’ fans continue to get a close up view of their club’s renaissance.Will the venue get a roof?Mercifully the weather held out for those magical nights in August but the stadium was originally conceived as a summer venue. Another chunk of cash has been earmarked to extend the venue’s circular roof to protect West Ham fans from the unpredictable elements.How much is all this going to cost?Converting the iconic venue to one which fits the bill for the Barclays Premier League, and one which can also cater for athletics and pop concerts, won’t come cheap. Estimates for the work range between £130million up to £200m and it is worth remembering the stadium cost £429m to put up in the first place.So who is going to cough up?Well, West Ham are willing to part with £15m towards the conversion plus £9million annually in rent and cash from commercial proceeds.  Fellow tenants, Newham Council, are in for between £40m and £60m while the Treasury has reached into its pockets for another £38million. Some shortfall estimates for the work range between £15 and £20m although West Ham argue that the cost of the conversion is covered with the cash already on the table.This is starting to sound like a cracking deal for West Ham - are they getting a 60,000 stadium for a knockdown price?There is little doubt that moving home would do wonders financially for a club currently around £80 million in debt and turning over around £80 million a year, provided they can maintain their top flight status. Do so and the match day revenue generated by the move to Stratford will dwarf the £18m they pull in annually at Upton Park.  David Gold and David Sullivan shelled out in the region of £50m to buy a 50% controlling stake in West Ham in January 2010 and a Premier League club with an iconic, state of the art home could certainly be an attractive proposition for outside investors. But one of the caveats of West Ham’s lease is expected to be that they share a slice of the profits with taxpayers if Gold and Sullivan eventually decide to cash in.So off to the New Boleyn Ground we go then?Romantic though that sounds, there is little prospect that West Ham will not attempt to sell the naming rights to their new ground. Manchester City get an estimated £400m from Etihad to have the airline’s name emblazoned on what was the City of Manchester Stadium, constructed for the 2006 Commonwealth Games. And while West Ham are unlikely to strike a deal of that magnitude, the potential naming rights cash would be too tempting to turn down especially if it  covered the £9m-a-year they are paying their landlords.And what happens to West Ham’s old Green Street home?Flattened is the overwhelming expectation. A 99-year lease on their new arena means the beige towers built from the proceeds of the £18m sale of Rio Ferdinand to Leeds will slip into memory. Potential buyers are already circling with community houses, flats and a supermarket the likely uses for the site.When will West Ham move in?Prior to the last bidding process collapsing in May, the club reckoned they could be out of their present home by the summer of 2014. But as a result of the delays in reaching a decision about the fate of the Olympic Stadium West Ham will need to extend that until at least the start of the2015/16 season. Many feel that timescale errs on the optimistic side as the necessary construction work may take until the summer of 2016 to be finished.

A group of Canadian travellers have been awarded $30,000 in compensation after they claimed their holiday was ruined by hundreds of drunk students on their spring break. The 19 angry tourists blame their travel agency for the ‘living nightmare’ that unfolded at the Mexican resort hotel, which was 'invaded' by 350 celebrating youngsters who urinated off their balconies and threw litter everywhere. Despite complaints, the group's 'holiday from hell' did not improve and the Toronto travel agency has now been forced for refunds and moral damages by a Montreal court. Spring break: The tourists have been compensated after partying students on spring break ruined their holiday (file photo) The Canadian travel group had arrived at Club Grand Coco Bay hotel in Riviera Maya, Mexico in March 2009 but were joined the following morning by ‘busloads’ of students. The students were celebrating the traditional ‘spring break’, a mid-term holiday in America where predominantly college students go on group holidays to party and let off steam. The drunk youngsters took over the resort, littered the pool area with broken glass, and forced staff to close the hotel’s Jacuzzi due to ‘fouled-up’ water. ‘The entire hotel was disrupted by shouts and noise that lasted all night,’ the judge’s decision from the Monteral court read.

After complaints from the guests, the hotel threw out six of the students, but the plaintiffs said in court that this did not stop the disruptions. A Montreal small claims court judge ruled against Sunwing Vacations travelling agency after the Quebec customers filed five separate claims seeking refunds for the cost of their vacation and moral damages of $500 per person. Despite protests from Sunwing Vacations that they should not have to compensate for the group’s flights, as there were no complaints regarding the travel, the judge ruled for full compensation.","Canadian travellers blamed agency for their 'living nightmare' holiday .

Popular: Reverend Richard Lee (above) has been suspended from his post after being arrested on suspicion of voyeurism . A married vicar has been suspended from his job after he was arrested on suspicion of voyeurism. The Rev Richard Lee, 48, has been on police bail since the summer while officers investigate the case. Police yesterday refused to reveal details of the claims against him. Mr Lee is the Church of England vicar for two Somerset village churches near Weston-super-Mare, St Augustine’s in Locking and St Mary’s in Hutton, where his 47-year-old wife, the Rev Anne Lee, also works. He is also the co-ordinator of a local music group called WWJD. The couple – who met while studying to be vicars and have two children – moved from their previous parish in Kent five years ago. Yesterday members of his previous congregation expressed shock at his arrest. A female parishioner at All Saints Church in Hempstead, Kent, said: ‘Richard was really popular here. He got on with everyone. 'I’m pretty shocked to hear [of his arrest].’ Last night it was not clear whether or not Mrs Lee is still officiating at services while her husband is on police bail. The vicar, who grew up in Fowey, Cornwall, is according to a social networking site profile, interested in ‘anything to do with railways’, sailing, reading, walking, the theatre, cinema and listening to and playing music. A spokesman for the Diocese of Bath and Wells said: ‘We can confirm that the Rev Richard Lee was arrested in July 2012.’ He added: ‘In accordance with the Clergy Discipline Measure 2003, the Bishop of Bath and Wells suspended Mr Lee from active ministry as soon as he was arrested. ‘The Diocese of Bath and Wells has and will continue to fully co-operate with police enquiries.’ Community figure: Rev Lee is the Church of England vicar for two Somerset village churches and also the co-ordinator of a local music group called WWJD . Place of worship: Rev Lee works at St Augustine's Church (above) in Locking and St Mary's in Hutton, where his 47-year-old wife, the Rev Anne Lee, also leads services . During his time at All Saints’ he raised money for the Friends of Chernobyl’s children charity by having a David Beckham makeover. Rev Lee had his head shaved in a Beckham-style skinhead and wore a stud earring during a service at the church. Mr Lee had promised to shave his locks in front of his flock if he raised at least £700 in sponsorship money, but local support saw the total soar to more than £1,370. But he drew the line at copying Beckham entirely and having a tattoo on his back. At the time, he said: ‘I won’t be getting a tattoo like Beckham and I have to refuse point blank to have my legs waxed.’ Yesterday a spokesman for Avon and Somerset police said: ‘We arrested a 48-year-old man from Weston on suspicion of voyeurism in July of this year. ‘Investigations are ongoing and the man remains on police bail.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Rev Richard Lee suspended from post at two churches after arrest .

Non!: French railway's new 'politeness police' will be able to fine passengers for antisocial behaviour, such as putting their feet on seats . France's state-owned railways are hiring hundreds of 'politeness police' to clamp down on bad manners on the nation's trains. The new employees will be 'conflict specialists' sent in to tackle mounting numbers of rude or unruly passengers. The main gripes of travellers included smoking on board, putting feet on seats, speaking loudly on mobile phones, playing music, swearing and amorous couples being 'too affectionate' with each other, a spokesman for the SNCF rail operator said. He added: 'We aim to tackle offensive or irritating everyday behaviour of certain people who make life a misery for other passengers and train employees. 'In certain cases our agents will be able to hand out fines, for smoking, putting feet on seats or damaging property. 'In other cases they will engage people in a conversation about simply having respect for their fellow passengers.' The scheme comes after a French mayor also brought in regulations to force people to be polite to each other in his town hall. Mayor Gerard Plee put up a notice warning that anyone who fails to say 'please' and 'thank you' to his staff or say 'hello' and 'goodbye' would be ejected from the building. He said he hoped the measure would improve 'social standards' in the village of Lheraule, northern France, which has just 185 residents. He added: 'A smile costs nothing and and in the case of manifest failure to comply voluntarily with these norms the person concerned will be requested to leave the premises.'

The mother of a woman who allegedly had a child with her father claims she tried to tell authorities about the incestuous relationship more than five years ago but was ignored. Vikki McConvey, from Bethel, Connecticut, said she went to police in January 2007 after she suspected there was more to her daughter Tiffany Hartford's relationship with George L. Sayers, 46, than just father and daughter. But she said police told her that because Tiffany was over 18 at the time, nothing could be done about it. The pair were charged on Monday with . third-degree sexual assault after DNA tests proved they are father and daughter and parents to their child. Related: Tiffany Hartford, 23, and George . Sayers, 46, of Bethel, Connecticut, were charged on Monday with . third-degree sexual assault. They lived in the same home with a number . of other relatives . Arrested: George Sayers, right, and his daughter Tiffany Hartford, 23, were charged on Monday with third-degree sexual assault after police discovered they had a child together . Ms McConvey said she moved back to Connecticut in 2006 so Tiffany could be near to her father who she hadn't seen since she was three years old. She broke up with Sayers in 1991. She wanted to list her as a runaway after Sayers took his daughter to Florida but again police said because she was 18 there was nothing they could do. 'I said to them, ""Even if she was having . relations with her father?""' It was something McConvey suspected . 'because they insisted on sharing the same bed.' She also revealed to The News Times that Tiffany was abused for years by another person who was later prosecuted for the crime. 'That is why she turned out the way she is,' Ms McConvey said of the 23-year-old. Although she hadn't seen her daughter for several months before her arrest, McConvey said she instinctively knew something was wrong. 'It was just the way that they were always together. Like they both put on their Facebook pages that they were married but didn't mention who their spouses were,' she said. Reported: Hartford's ex-girlfriend went to police when she learned Sayers was selling videos of the former couple having sex when they were just 16 . Incest: Both Sayers and Hartford initially denied knowing they were father and daughter, but DNA tests confirmed this and that they had a son together . 'I didn't know what to think. I'd hope that it was just a father-and-daughter thing and nothing else. 'I tried to talk to Tiffany into coming home with me. She wouldn't. She wanted to get to know her father more, she told me.' The . couple were shopped to police this week by Tiffany's ex-girlfriend who . was angry that Sayers was selling pictures of sex videos of her. A search of Sayers' computer turned up similar images, as well as a commercial video of Hartford dressed in risque outfits and . posing in sexually provocative positions, crediting . him with being the producer, police said. Because she was over 16 when they were taken, they are not considered to be child porn. The father and daughter were also charged with obscenity and conspiracy. They have pleaded not guilty to all charges. Hartford, . who would introduce Sayers as her 'husband/father', told police she had . dreams of being a porn star - this was before she became pregnant with . her father's child. In separate interviews, both Sayers and Hartford initially denied knowing they were father and daughter, according to the NewsTimes, although Sayers said at one point he believed that Hartford was the daughter of his deceased brother, police said.","Tiffany Hartford and her father George Sayers were arrested and charged with incest .
