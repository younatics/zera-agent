"The body of a starved springer spaniel found dumped near a school, was at the centre of an RSPCA investigation. The  emaciated animal, that was described as just 'skin and bones,' was discovered wrapped in a blue horse rug inside a blue and grey plastic kennel. The grim discovery of the male tan and white spaniel was made by a dog walker after it had been discarded behind a pipe by the side of a road in Iwade, near Sittingbourne, Kent, just yards from a local school. Warning graphic content . The RSPCA has launched an investigation to find out what happened to the starved springer spaniel . Today the RSPCA were trying to track down the animal's callous owners after saying they believed the dog had suffered in the run up to its death. RSPCA animal welfare officer Kelly Thatcher is leading the investigation into the neglected animal, who was found without any identification and is thought to be about five years old. The discovery was made close to Iwade C.P. School. The discovery comes just months after a dead border collie, also emaciated, was found in nearby bushes. 'It wasn't much of a Happy Christmas for this poor dog - who had clearly suffered leading up to his death,' said Ms Thatcher. The body of the emaciated springer spaniel was found dumped in Iwade, Kent . 'I was shocked at how thin he was - completely skin and bones. 'At first I had hoped he had died a natural death and then been dumped, but seeing how thin he was, and young, I doubt it. 'It was also such a callous way to dump the poor dog. Over the fence and lying among all manner of rubbish. 'We urge anyone with any information about this incident to let us know on 0300 123 8018.'

"In the latest edition of our series on the travel habits of the rich and famous, we talk to radio presenter Gaby Roslin about memories of Zimbabwe and her attitude to skinny-dipping. First holiday without your parents? In summer 1980, I turned 16 and went to Israel to live on a kibbutz for five weeks. We walked in the Negev Desert and stayed on the university campus in Jerusalem - amazing and life-changing. Gaby Roslin: Dreams of Sardinia, loves London . How do you get the holiday buzz? I love flying. It reminds me of my childhood when we flew to visit my grandparents in Zimbabwe. Place you most want to visit? I want to go back to Zimbabwe, as it holds so many memories. I love the beautiful vast expanse of sky, the African sunset and smell. Most romantic travel destination? Probably where my husband [publisher David Osman] asked me to marry him - in Turks and Caicos in the Caribbean, in 2012. He got down on one knee and proposed under the stars. Ever skinny-dipped on holiday? No. I'm far too self-conscious and I've never done that in my life. I'm quite shy, so absolutely no way am I ever going to skinny dip. Your travel philosophy? My mother was a linguist and always told me, 'Learn good morning, good evening, please, thank you and excuse me' in the local language and don't presume that everybody speaks English. Her attitude was, eat local food, speak the language and immerse yourself. With money no object, where would you go? Africa. We'd go as a family to Victoria Falls and on safari. The Turks and Caicos Islands: Not a bad sort of setting for a marriage proposal . If you emigrated, where would it be to? I wouldn't. I love London far too much and both David and I are born-and-bred Londoners. However, if I could afford it, I'd buy a holiday home in Sardinia. Tip for a holiday read? I've just finished The Unlikely Pilgrimage Of Harold Fry by Rachel Joyce. It's about an elderly man who gets up off his sofa and walks and walks and walks through the UK. It's beautifully written. Gaby's radio show is on BBC London every Sunday from 3pm on 94.9 FM.","BBC London presenter had her first major holidays in the wilds of Africa .

"A doctor's office left a McDonald's cheeseburger and fries along with a Taco Bell chicken taco in the open-air for two years to monitor what happened. The answer? Not a lot. As the fast-food approaches its two-year anniversary on the counter of the chiropractors' surgery in Waterford, Michigan, the meals appear weirdly unchanged - with no decay and no funky smells. Dr Jacqueline Vaughn, of Vaughn Chiropractic, told Daily Mail Online on Wednesday that she hoped to make people think about what they were putting in their bodies - especially her fast-food loving younger patients. Scroll down for video . Doctors in Michigan left out some fast food for two years at their Michigan clinic - only to find out that it changes very little and emanates no smells . She said: 'There's no smell from it, it's basically mummified. You can pick it up, turn it over and still see the cheese and pickle in the burger and the lettuce and cheese in the Taco Bell. 'Even in the summer when we get ants, the bugs won't go near it.' Dr Vaughn said that she planned to keep the fast-food on display 'forever'. Wayne State University professor of food science Yafan Zhang told CBS that it's a preservative called calcium probinate that keeps the food looking almost still edible for a long time. The burger (above) and the taco appeared 'mummified', the doctors said, but had not rotted after two years in the open air . The preservative is used in a range of products to keep them fresh such as bread, cakes and processed meat. It is non-toxic and approved safe to use, following rigorous labratory testing. Dr Zhang also told CBS: 'These ingredients, they have potential to cause some inflammation in our stomachs... unless you eat a lot of this type of food everyday – then you will be okay.' Eight out of ten Americans admit visiting fast-food restaurants each month - and half of people eat there at least once a week, according to a 2013 Gallup study. Young adults, aged from 18 to 29, eat fast food most often with more than half saying they do so at least once a week.

"Delia Smith famously published two recipes on it, Jean-Christophe Novelli says if you can't do it, then you shouldn't be cooking at all, and Mrs Beeton claimed they taste much better when they are been newly laid. The inexact science of cooking a perfectly boiled egg is one that has tripped up most home cooks. But now a simple little gadget, using temperature instead of time, can tell you exactly when you need to take an egg out of the water. The Egg-Perfect timer uses temperature instead of time to deliver perfectly boiled eggs . Delia Smith says you must never boil an egg that has come straight from the fridge as it is likely to crack . The Egg-Perfect timer $6 (£4) plastic egg has soft, medium and hard indicators on its curved front and a flat surface on the other end which rests at the bottom of the pan. Absorbing heat exactly as an egg does, the timer changes colour from the outside edge in as boiling eggs progess from raw to soft, medium or hard boiled. The clever device even automatically adjusts to the number of eggs and level of water in the pot so perfect eggs are delivered every single time. Overcooked hard boiled eggs usually have a ring of grey around the yolk and a powdery texture . The £4 Egg-Perfect egg timer . The question of cooking a perfectly boiled egg has vexed many for decades. Experts at the British Egg Information Service devised a foolproof way to tell when an egg is boiled to perfection: a high-tech ink logo stamped onto the shell that indicates when the egg is soft, medium or hard-boiled. But can a complex culinary art really be reduced to a science? Looking at the advice of leading chefs, it seems the answer is that no two can agree on a single method - and Delia Smith actually offers two. Michel Roux said: 'The secret is not to boil it at all. Growing up in the South of France after the war, we only had eggs as a treat on Sundays as they were very expensive. 'My mother would place the eggs in a small saucepan and cover them with cold water. Then she put them on a medium heat. 'As soon as the water began to simmer - not boil - she would remove the eggs. They would be cooked perfectly and were never rubbery. 'If you like your eggs done a little more, then take the pan off the heat as soon as the water begins to simmer and leave the eggs in the hot water for around 30 seconds. Delia Smith has two methods to cooking eggs . Delia Smith’s book book, How To Cook, devotes two pages to the art of cooking eggs. She says you must never boil an egg that has come straight from the fridge as it is likely to crack. (Incidentally, three Michelin star chef Heston Blumenthal suggests putting cold eggs in hot - not boiling - water for a couple of minutes first.) Use a small saucepan to prevent the eggs knocking into each other and breaking. Also, always make a pinprick in the rounded end to prevent pressure building up in the air-pocket, which would crack the shell. Delia has two methods for producing an egg with a perfectly runny, golden centre. Method One: Use a small saucepan filled with enough simmering water to cover the eggs by about half an inch. Quickly, but gently, lower the eggs into the water, one at a time, using a tablespoon. Simmer for one minute, remove the pan from the heat and put a lid on it. Leave the eggs in the pan for six more minutes for a soft, fairly liquid yolk and a white that is just set but still quite wobbly. Or for seven minutes if you like a firmer, more creamy yolk with a white that is completely set. Method Two: Place the pan with the eggs in cold water on a high heat. When they reach boiling point, reduce to a simmer and cook for three minutes if you like a really soft-boiled egg; four minutes for a white that is just set and a creamy yolk; five minutes for a white and yolk perfectly set with a bit of ‘squidgy’ in the centre . But chef Jean-Christophe Novelli has a different method . 'Boiling an egg is not easy and if you can master it, then you are officially in a position to cook. I prefer to start the way my mother and my grandmother did — by putting the egg straight into boiling water. ' Dr Charles Williams, a physicist from Exeter University has worked out a formula for the perfect boiled egg based on the ‘heat-diffusion equation for spherical objects’. According to his findings, a medium egg weighing 1.75oz (50g) taken straight from a 4c fridge needs four minutes and 30 seconds in boiling water to give it a perfect soft centre. A smaller egg of 1.5oz (43g) from the fridge takes four minutes 15 seconds to cook and a larger one — 2.25oz (63g)— takes five minutes 30 seconds. A medium egg stored at room temperature (21c) takes a few seconds under four minutes. 'Use a metal basket — for example, a deep sieve — to lower the eggs into the water together. That way, if you are cooking more than one, they will all be ready at the same time. 'Plus, you are less likely to burn yourself on the hot water and steam or break the eggs by throwing them in too fast. 'Leave the eggs in the pan for precisely three minutes. Then take them out and plunge them into another container filled with iced water, and you will have the perfect soft-boiled egg. In her seminal 1861 kitchen authority, Mrs Beeton’s Book Of Household Management, Isabella Beeton exhorts: ‘Eggs are much better when new-laid than a day or two afterwards. ‘The usual time allotted for boiling eggs in the shell is three to 3.25 minutes: less time will not be sufficient to solidify the white, whereas longer will make the yolk less digestible. 'Great care should be employed in putting them into the water, to prevent cracking the shell.’","The Egg-Perfect timer uses temperature instead of time to cook egg .

"The CEO of technology firm Monster is suing Beats Electronics and its co-founders Dr Dre and Jimmy Iovine for allegedly duping him before selling the headphone company to Apple for $3billion. In the complaint, filed in a California court on Tuesday, Noel Lee, who also founded the video and audio cable maker, accuses rapper Dr Dre and record producer Mr Iovine of double crossing him. Mr Lee - who once held a 5 percent stake in Beats via a Monster-Beats partnership that ended in 2012 - claims the pair deliberately orchestrated a 'sham' deal with smartphone maker HTC in 2011. This deal, he says, led to the termination of the Monster alliance - he pared his stake in Beats to 1.25 per cent before selling his remaining holdings for $5.5 million in the autumn of 2013. Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: The CEO of technology firm Monster is suing Beats Electronics and its co-founders Dr Dre (left) and Jimmy Iovine (right) for allegedly duping him before selling the headphone company to Apple for $3billion . At the time, he was assured by Beats executives that there were no plans to sell the company for at least several years, he states in the lawsuit, which was filed in San Mateo Superior Court. However, following Dr Dre's and Mr Iovine's alleged shady maneuvering, Beats announced its sale to Apple last May, enabling the pair to become executives at the iPhone and iPad maker. Had he held on to his 1.25 percent stake, Mr Lee would have received more than $30 million in the Apple deal. His original 5 percent stake would have been worth roughly $150 million. Both Dr Dre, whose real name is Andre Young, and Mr Iovine, a longtime recording industry executive, reaped the biggest jackpots in the Apple deal. However, the precise size of their windfalls has not been disclosed. In his lawsuit, Mr Lee states the pair each owned 15 percent stakes in the early stages of the Beats partnership. Besides Dr Dre and Mr Iovine, the lawsuit targets HTC America Holding Ltd. and Paul Wachter, a Beats investor and board member. Monster CEO: In the complaint, filed in a California court on Tuesday, Noel Lee (pictured), who also founded the video and audio cable maker, accuses rapper Dr Dre and record producer Mr Iovine of double crossing him . 'Fraud': Mr Lee - who once held a 5 percent stake in Beats (file picture) via a Monster-Beats partnership that ended in 2012 - claims the pair deliberately orchestrated a 'sham' deal with smartphone maker HTC in 2011 . Apple Inc, which now employs Dre and Iovine, declined to comment on the lawsuit. The Cupertino company isn't named in the complaint. Mr Lee's bitterness in his lawsuit seemingly contradicts how he described the culmination of the Monster-Beats partnership in a late 2013 interview with The Associated Press (AP). At that time, Lee called it an 'amicable' parting and said he was paid 'very generously' in royalties. This isn't the first time that a former Beats partner has lashed out at Dre and Iovine in court. David Hyman, who sold his music streaming service MOG to Beats in 2012, is suing the pair for bad faith. That action, filed shortly before the Apple deal, is unfolding in Los Angeles Superior Court. Executives: The HTC deal led to the termination of the Monster alliance. Last May, Beats announced its sale to Apple last May, enabling Dr Dre (right) and Mr Iovine (left) to become executives at the iPhone and iPad maker . In Mr Lee's case, he appears to be interested in recovering the money that he believes he lost through the alleged misconduct of Dr Dre and Mr Iovine. The lawsuit also depicts the executive as the brains behind the Beats By Dre headphones, while casting Dr Dre and Mr Iovine as little more than figureheads. One section of the lawsuit likens Mr Lee to two more famous innovators, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and sound-system pioneer Ray Dolby. Voicemails seeking comment were left for Dr Dre's attorney and Beats by AP on Tuesday.","In lawsuit, Monster CEO Noel Lee targets Beats, Dr Dre and Jimmy Iovine .

"A father has released a video of his 14-month-old daughter 'playing' with a huge python in order to show that the snake is not dangerous. The clip shows toddler Alyssa Guarino, now three, as she plays with a 13ft Burmese python in her family's home in Warren, a suburb of Detroit, Michigan. Alyssa's father, professional snake handler Jamie Guarino, says the giant snake posed no danger to his little girl and that pythons simply have a bad reputation. Scroll down for video . Harmless?

Mr Guarino said: 'I was trying to show that snakes are not evil creatures, they can be a loving pet despite their bad reputation. My daughter was absolutely in no danger.' 'When people see the way Nay-Nay is with Alyssa they mostly react with fear or negativity and I don't understand why. 'As you can see the snake is roaming around and it has no interest in biting her, or choking her or swallowing her. This is an embedded fear and I think people are just brainwashed.'

The Guarinos share their home with a staggering 30 reptiles, including 13ft Nay-Nay, anacondas and alligators. 'I think the benefits of raising children around exotics is simple, they can open up their mind to something different rather than your average pet,' Mr Guarino adds. 'My plan is to open up a reptile zoo with my daughters. we want to share our passion and educate people that reptiles belong.' But his relaxed attitude toward his beloved snakes raises eyebrows amongst people who see them as inherently dangerous. Jamie said: 'To those of you who might see this as irresponsible or dangerous, please don't judge me based on fear or something you don't understand. Snakes can be and are loving animals.

"The UK's largest sand drawing - an image of a Land Rover Defender measuring 1km long - has been created in the same location its inventor sketched the car's unmistakable shape almost 70 years ago. This year, Jaguar Land Rover is set to stop building the model - a favourite of the royal family - and in recognition of the end of an era, six classic defenders were used to draw the car in the sand in Red Wharf Bay in Anglesey. This is where Maurice Wilks - the man behind the original Land Rover - imagined the iconic design. Scroll down for video. Land Rover: The UK's largest sand drawing - an image of a a Defender measuring 1km long - has been created using six of the vehicles . Discontinued: Jaguar Land Rover will stop building the Defender in the UK this year and the artwork commemorated its history . Defenders: Each car towed a 12ft agricultural harrow to create the drawing in the sand in Red Wharf Bay in Anglesey . 'Massive': 'If you don't do everything quickly enough, the sea comes in and you basically don't have an image and then it's game over. This is unique in that it's massive and it's using these wonderful machines to make it,' said sand artist Jamie Wardley . Each car - a Land Rover Series I, II and III, a Ninety from the Eighties, a Defender 90 Hard Top and a Defender 110 Station Wagon - towed an 12ft agricultural harrow to create the drawing, . They helped to draw the continuous 4.52km line over about three hours, but the artwork only remained in place for a matter of minutes before it was washed away by the incoming tide. Stephen Wilks, son of Maurice, said: 'We used to come here for our holiday periods. 'My father met his brother on the beach and was explaining the concept of a new idea for a go anywhere, do anything vehicle. 'He made a drawing in the sand of an outline of how he thought the Land Rover could be made. 'That was the start of it all, the conception of Land Rover.' The Wilks family owned land on the Welsh island and Maurice wanted a versatile vehicle that could double as a light tractor and off-roader. Family history: Sand artist Jamie Wardley (right) helped create the image at the spot where Stephen Wilks (left), son of the man behind the original Land Rover, doodled a picture in the sand . Future: Land Rover is set to cease production of the Defender at the end of the year, but this week a spokesman for the firm said it is 'investigating the possibility of maintaining production of the current Defender at an overseas production facility' UK manufacturing: The last of the current Land Rover Defenders will roll-off the production lines of Jaguar Land Rover’s Solihull factory in the West Midlands in December . 4x4: The Wilks family owned land on the Welsh island and Maurice wanted a versatile vehicle that could double as a light tractor and off-roader . Washed away: The image, which took around three hours to create, lasted just minutes before the tide came in . Post war: The popular 4x4 vehicle, which is exported all around the world, represents the continuation of the very first Land Rover which came on to the scene in April 1948 and was modelled on the war-time jeeps . Special editions: Land Rover launched a year of celebrations with three run-out special limited edition versions of the Defender - called Heritage, Adventure and Autobiography . His design was christened the 'Land Rover', the outline of which is now recognised as the Defender. The first car rolled off the production line 68 years ago. Sand artist, Jamie Wardley said: 'If you don't do everything quickly enough, the sea comes in and you basically don't have an image and then it's game over. 'This is unique in that it's massive and it's using these wonderful machines to make it.' Land Rover is set to cease production of the Defender at the end of the year, a decision which has been criticised by purists and fans of the marque. This week, however, a Land Rover spokesman said: 'Land Rover is investigating the possibility of maintaining production of the current Defender at an overseas production facility, after the close of UK manufacturing. 'Any continuation would see low volume production maintained for sale outside the EU.’ The announcement came as the firm launched a year of celebrations with three run-out special limited edition versions of the Defender - called Heritage, Adventure and Autobiography . Popular: The Land Rover Defender has featured in the last James Bond movie, Skyfall, and the Angelina Jolie film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider . Invented: Red Wharf Bay in Anglesey is where Maurice Wilks - the man behind the original Land Rover - imagined the iconic design . Christened: Maurice Wilks' design was called the 'Land Rover', the outline of which is now recognised as the Defender . Royalty: The Defender is a favourite of the royal family and has featured in blockbuster movies . Six classic defenders were used to draw the car in the sand in Red Wharf Bay in Anglesey. Each car towed a 12ft agricultural harrow to turn the sand over. The image was made with one continuous 4.52km line and the help of sand artist, Jamie Wardley. Nick Rogers, Land Rover vehicle line director, said: 'With a history stretching back 68 years, this is a Land Rover that has thrived for decades on its unquestionable capability and iconic shape. 'I now have the honour of being one of the many enthusiasts at Land Rover committed to creating a fitting successor to the legendary Defender.' The last of the current Land Rover Defenders will roll-off the production lines of Jaguar Land Rover’s Solihull factory in the West Midlands in December. The popular 4x4 vehicle, which is exported all around the world, represents the continuation of the very first Land Rover which came on to the scene in April 1948 and was modelled on the war-time jeeps. It featured in the last James Bond movie, Skyfall, and the Angelina Jolie film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider.","Image was created in  same location designer sketched car's unmistakable shape in the sand almost 70 years ago .

Paramedics rushed over to attend to the motionless Ammann before calling for help . Ammann was rushed to hospital where he later regained consciousness; he is now said to be in a stable condition and can move 'all parts of his body' Swiss media  later reported that Amman had regained consciousness while at a hospital in Salzburg. The International Ski Federation later tweeted to say Ammann was in a stable condition and that he could 'move all parts of his body'. The athlete, who was in eighth place after the first round of jumps, would remain in hospital for further examinations, the federation said.

"It seems that Nicholas Sparks' bird flew the nest over a month ago. The author's wife, Cathy Sparks, paid $1.1million for a North Carolina mansion back on December 9, a month before the two announced they were splitting after 25 years. She didn't go far though, as the home is just over two miles from the family home in the town of New Bern. Scroll down for video . New digs: Cathy Sparks, paid $1.1million for a North Carolina mansion (above) back on December 9 . Moving on: The couple recently announced they are splitting after 25 years . Nice digs: The home sits on four acres of lakefront property and is just a few miles from where her family lives . The home is fairly modest and sits on 4 acres of lakefront property. It is a huge departure from the massive estate the author built just three years ago and where Cathy was living, with a bowling alley, screening room, and even a hidden room for napping in the basement. As TMZ previously reported, the couple signed a postmarital agreement back in August meaning that they have settled all their property and that neither side will receive alimony. They have not however filed their divorce documents yet. Sparks, who has written 17 novels - and seen almost all of them go on to become Hollywood films - including The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, Message in a Bottle and The Last Song, had spoken of how hard he and his wife work on their relationship in past interviews. 'There are people who are probably much better at marriage than I am – they've lasted a lot longer,' he told People in 2003. 'I could probably learn from them.' He has also revealed that he met his wife on a Monday and told her he was going to marry her the next day. The couple have five children, three sons and twin daughters, ranging in age from 12 to 23.","Cathy Sparks paid $1.1millior a New Bern, North Carolina mansion back in December .

"Health chiefs in North Wales have been forced to recruit more than 70 Spanish nurses, amid a staffing crisis gripping the country's health system. It has emerged the situation in recruiting staff to posts in the Labour-run Welsh NHS is so desperate that managers have resorted to interviewing potential candidates via Skype. It comes as experts blamed a failure to reach A&E waiting times, in part, on an inability to recruit doctors and nurses across the UK. New figures published yesterday revealed A&E waiting times have reached their lowest levels in England in a decade. The Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board has recruited more than 70 nurses from Spain, some having been interviewed via Skype, amid a staffing crisis in the NHS. File picture . Just 92.6 per cent of patients were seen within the four-hour time - short of the 95 per cent target dictated by the NHS in England. However politicians highlighted English A&Es are still performing better than those in the Labour-run Welsh NHS. In November, just 83.3 per cent of patients in Wales were seen within the four-hour time period, short of the 95 per cent target. As well as a rising number of patients across the UK, experts warned a staffing crisis is hampering emergency departments. Responding to the English figures yesterday, Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: 'Hospital trusts trying to recruit more staff have been hamstrung by the short-sighted cuts to nurse training places, which mean there simply aren't enough nurses in the system. 'This is made worse by chronic under-resourcing of community services and social care, which means more people end up in A&E who could be better treated elsewhere.' Forty-five of the 70 nurses recruited have started working at the region's three major hospitals, including Gwynedd in Bangor, pictured . Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl will also welcome some of the 70 new nurses recruited from Spain . Health officials in North Wales said 45 of the 70 new nurses have already started work at the region's three major hospitals, Gwynedd in Bangor, Glan Clwyd in Rhyl and Wrexham Maelor. The remaining nurses are expected to move to Wales to start work this year. Hospitals recruited almost 6,000 overseas nurses last year, a four-fold increase on the previous year. Four out of five new NHS nurses are foreign, with managers flying to Spain and Portugal to hire up to 50 at a time. Figures released last month show that hospitals hired 5,778 foreign nurses last year, up from 1,360 the year before. However there are fears that severe staffing shortages are leading managers to lower the bar for recruits’ English skills. Last month the Daily Mail visited a recruitment fair in Porto, Portugal, where Bedford Hospital hired four nurses. A spokesman for the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board admitted that it, like many other NHS bodies, was 'struggling to recruit new recruits from within the UK'. The board is working with Bangor and Glyndwr Universities to train nurses to degree level. But the process takes three years, and the need to recruit new staff is immediate. The spokesman said: 'We need to attract qualified nurses. 'The requirements have not changed. It takes a period of time to get degrees, you also need experience. 'During 2014 we recruited more than 70 nurses from Spain; 45 of these have now moved to Wales and taken up their posts, with the rest due to join us this year.' He added that all new Spanish nurses spoke English and some were also in the process of learning Welsh. 'We do not require staff to learn Welsh as a condition of their employment,' he added. 'Where a post requires a Welsh speaker then this forms part of the recruitment and selection criteria. 'However, as a health board we do provide active support to staff who wish to learn to speak Welsh and a number of the nurses from Spain have expressed an interest in and have commenced learning the language.' Welsh Shadow Health Minister Darren Millar said: 'There have been consistent problems in the recruitment and retention of doctors and nurses across North Wales for some time, so it is pleasing to see action to begin to address staffing shortages. It comes as experts said the staffing crisis - an inability to recruit sufficient numbers of doctors and nurses from within the UK - is hampering efforts to improve waiting times in A&E. Ambulances are pictured queuing outside the accident and emergency department at University Hospital Wales in Cardiff . New figures published on Tuesday, revealed A&E waiting times in England have fallen to their lowest levels in a decade with just 92.6 per cent of patients seen within four hours - short of the 95 per cent target. But despite the poor performance, politicians have pointed out English A&Es are performing better than those in the Labour-run Welsh NHS, where just 83.8 per cent of patients were seen within four hours in November . 'What matters most to hospital patients is not the birthplace of their nurse, but that medically trained nurses are on hand in sufficient numbers to provide safe and high quality care. 'While recruiting nurses from abroad suggests the scale of recruitment problems in Wales, many patients will welcome increased nurse numbers on hospital wards in North Wales. 'The use of Skype to interview prospective employees may seem unorthodox for the NHS but it is a tool which is often used to interview remote candidates by private businesses and can help to keep recruitment costs down - I have no problem with it.' However, Plaid Cymru North Wales Assembly Member Llyr Gruffydd said: 'For such a large organisation, it’s surprising that the health board is unable to plan its workforce recruitment without having to use an agency to go to Spain to recruit additional staff. 'Nurse training at Glyndwr University has been reduced in the past couple of years and now we’re seeing the results of that with having to go overseas to recruit 70 Spanish nurses. 'It smacks of stop-gap measures rather than long-term planning and, although I understand the nurses in question are very experienced and highly qualified, you have to wonder how long they intend to stay in Wales.'","The NHS in North Wales has recruited more than 70 nurses from Spain .

"Police arrested a 40-year-old man in a dawn raid today as part of an investigation into overseas terror offences. Officers from the South East Counter Terrorism Unit, along with colleagues from Sussex Police, held the suspect in Crawley, West Sussex, as part of an investigation into 'conflicts overseas.' The arrest is not linked to any immediate threat in the UK, police have said. Police in patrol cars stood guard outside a semi-detached home in the town this afternoon. Terror raid: Police have arrested a 40-year-old man at this home in Crawley at dawn this morning over alleged overseas terror offences . A neighbour, who asked not to be named, said the 40-year-old, who was detained in a dawn raid, was a 'really nice family guy who goes about his business.' He was said to have lived at the home for 'quite a few years.' A police spokesman said the man was detained under section 11 of the Terrorism Act 2000 and remained in custody while an address was searched. They added: 'SECTU and Sussex Police would like to reassure residents that the police activity today is part of a normal investigation in relation to conflicts overseas and is not linked to any immediate threat to local communities or anywhere else in the UK. 'We are committed to intervening in activities such as this which cause concern to local communities and we will continue to work with our partners and local communities in order to protect them from individuals and organisations which may seek to exploit them for extremist purposes.'

"A Nordic diet, full of fish, vegetables, berries and rapeseed oil can reduce the damaging effects of being overweight, a study found. Nordic researchers discovered the Nordic diet can prevent inflammation which is associated with many obesity-related diseases. The diet seems to stops the expression of a gene in fat cells found below the skin, which is associated with inflammation. Inflammation of the fat tissue below the skin, known as the subcutaneous adipose tissue, is believed to cause many health problems such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure. A Nordic diet including fresh fish three times a week can reduce the health-damaging effects of being overweight, researchers discovered . It is also associated with a condition called athlerosclerosis - where the arties become clogged up with fatty substances known as plaques. These can cause the arteries to harden and narrow, restricting blood flow to organs and stop them functioning. They can also cause blood clots, which can trigger a heart attack or a stroke. The Nordic diet has been touted as the next big trend in weight loss. It involves eating seasonal ingredients including fresh vegetables and fruit, foraged herbs – even dandelions – from the wild, lots of fish, less meat and more game. Copenhagen University researchers published a study earlier this year which found that overweight Danes on the healthy Nordic diet lost three times as much weight as those eating more typical fare such as meat balls, pizza and spaghetti. Researchers from the University of East Finland wanted to find out whether the Nordic diet could affect inflammation that causes chronic diseases like obesity and high blood pressure, without weight loss. They recruited middle aged men and women exhibiting at least two characteristics of metabolic syndrome, a combination of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity. This included increased blood pressure, high blood sugar levels even at fasting, abnormal levels of fat in the blood, or being at slightly overweight. For a period of 18 to 24 weeks, half of the study participants followed the health-promoting Nordic diet consisting of whole grain products, vegetables, root vegetables, berries, fruit, low-fat dairy products, rapeseed oil and three servings of fish per week. The Nordic diet involves ditching olive oil for controlled amounts of rapeseed oil (pictured left, with a field of rapeseeds pictured right) The control group consumed low-fibre grain products, butter-based spreads, and had a limited intake of fish. Participants were asked to keep their body weight the same during the study, and researchers found no significant weight changes occurred during this time. Samples of their fatty tissue were taken at the beginning and end of the study, and transcriptomics analysis was performed in order to study the expression of genes. The researchers found differences in the functioning of as many as 128 genes in the fatty tissue as a result of the diet. The expression of several inflammation-associated genes was lower than in the control group. The researchers said it is ‘significant’ that diet can be used to affect the expression of genes associated with inflammation, without weight loss. Eating a handful of bilberries a day could reduce the effects of a high-fat diet, scientists found . A handful of bilberries a day could help reduce the impact of a high-fat diet, scientists found. Eating the small, blue, flat-topped fruit - the wilder, more acidic version of a blueberry - diminishes the harmful effects of eating a lot of fat. For the first time, the berries - which are grown in the wild in the north of England and are a key part of the Nordic diet - were shown to have beneficial effects on both blood pressure and inflammation. Inflammation is the body’s natural immune response and is initially beneficial, but can cause several conditions and diseases in the long term. The University of East Finland researchers believe the beneficial health effects of bilberries are due to high levels of polyphenols. These are a a disease-fighting chemical component significantly higher in bilberries than in commercially-cultivated blueberries.","Nordic diet is full of fish, vegetables, berries and rapeseed oils .

"A man charged in the death of the 2-year-old son of Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson is back in custody after South Dakota authorities say he contacted the boy's mother and violated bond terms. Joseph Patterson, 28, turned himself in to the authorities Tuesday. The Minnehaha County Sheriff's Office had issued an arrest warrant. Patterson was released on a $2million bond in September. He is charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter and aggravated assault in the 2013 beating death of Tyrese Ruffin. Back in custody: Joseph Patterson (left), 28, turned himself in after violating an order of protection obtained by the mother of 2-year-old Tyrese Ruffin (right), whom he allegedly killed in 2013 . Brutal death: Patterson is charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter and aggravated assault in the beating death of Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson's lovechild . Biological father: Peterson, 29, had learned of Tyrese's existence two months before his slaying . Patterson also faces aggravated assault and kidnapping charges in an alleged attack on Tyrese's mother, Ann Doohen, in June 2014. Patterson was living with Doohen in Sioux Falls when on October 9, 2013, he called 911 and reported the boy had stopped breathing. Doctors determined Tyrese's fatal head injuries couldn't have been accidental. Less than two weeks later, Patterson was indicted on second-degree murder and manslaughter charges carrying a mandatory life sentence. Prosecutors say Patterson beat the boy to death, but the suspect maintains 2-year-old Tyrese choked on a snack. According to court documents, Patterson violated a protection order by inundating his ex-girlfirend, Tyrese's mother, with more than a dozen phone calls within minutes over the weekend. Persistent: Court documents claim Patterson called Tyrese's mother, Ann Doohen (right), more than a dozen times Saturday asking her to get back together . His version of events: he suspect maintains 2-year-old Tyrese choked on a snack in October 2013 . Miss Doohen told authorities the first call came just after 3am Saturday. Although no number showed up on the caller ID, the woman said she recognized Patterson's voice. The same person called twice more within minutes. One the third call, Patterson allegedly told Doohen he still loved her and wanted to get back together. Domestic abuse scandal: In September, Peterson was arrested for repeatedly striking his four-year-old son, Adrian Jr, with a wooden switch . After she hung up, Patterson redialed her again, but this time Doohen put him on speaker and had her iPad at the ready to record their conversation. Court papers obtained by Keloland indicate that Miss Doohen can be seen in the video recording telling her ex-boyfriend, 'I don't know what you want me to say, Joey,' to which he responds, 'Don't say my name.' The 28-year-old allegedly proceeded to call Doohen 13 more times that night. Vikings star Adrian Peterson, 29, had learned of Tyrese's existence two months before his slaying and only met him for the first time the day before he passed away. 'I was planning on seeing him and I had talked with his mom and had gotten some things together as far as financially helping her. Unfortunately, this situation took place and it's devastating,' Peterson said on the day of the boy's funeral. In September, Peterson himself was arrested for repeatedly striking his four-year-old son, Adrian Jr, with a wooden switch. The boy was left with lacerations across his body. The NFL suspended Peterson until at least April 2015 and in court he pleaded no contest to a lesser assault charge. 'I love my son more than any of you can imagine,' Peterson, who has six children, said outside court in November.","Joseph Patterson, 28, was released on a $2million bond in September after being charged with murder, manslaughter and aggravated assault .

"Australia’s national airline has been named the safest on the planet after a year when the world was captivated by a series of air tragedies and mysteries. With a ‘fatality free record’ in the jet era, Qantas scored top marks out of nearly 450 carriers monitored by aviation safety review website AirlineRatings.com. The Australian-based website ranked the rest of its top ten in alphabetical order, with British Airways, Gulf carriers Emirates and Etihad Airways, and Lufthansa finding a place on the list.

TUI Fly . WestJet . Source: AirlineRatings.com . Air New Zealand, Cathay Pacific Airways, Taiwan’s EVA Air, Finnair and Singapore Airlines rounded out the top ten. No major US legacy carrier managed to break into the top ten. However Alaska Airlines and JetBlue were included in a ranking of the world's safest budget carriers. AirlineRatings.com singled out Qantas as the world’s safest airline because it ‘has amassed an extraordinary record of firsts in aviation safety and operations’ over its 94-year history and ‘is now accepted as the world’s most experienced airline’. It said Qantas has been a leader in a number of areas, including the development of the flight data recorder and using satellite technology for automatic landings and real-time monitoring of its aircraft engines. British Airways was named one of the top ten safest airlines in the world, along with Lufthansa and Emirates . AirlineRatings.com also identified its ten safest budget airlines, with two British carriers – Luton-based Monarch Airlines and Manchester-based Thomas Cook – cracking the list. Aer Lingus, Alaska Airlines, Icelandair, JetBlue, Jetstar, Kulula.com, TUI Fly and WestJet rounded out the top ten in alphabetical order. Dublin-based Ryanair – Europe’s largest budget carrier - did not make the top ten. The low-cost airlines that made the list were selected because each has passed the stringent International Air Transport Association Operational Safety Audit (IOSA), said AirlineRatings.com. AirlineRatings.com also identified its ten safest budget airlines, with Monarch Airlines making the list . Thomas Cook was named one of the world's safest budget airlines - but Dublin-based Ryanair was not . Of 449 airlines which were included in the study, 149 achieved the website’s seven-star safety ranking and almost 50 had just three stars or less. Five airlines - Agni Air, Kam Air, Nepal Airlines, Scat and Tara Air- found themselves at the bottom of the list with just one star each. The website, a joint initiative between The West Australian and Aerospace Technical Publications International, said its rating system is based on audits from the industry’s governing bodies and governments, plus an airline’s fatality record. But the study is overshadowed by an awful 12 months for airline safety with some of the most tragic and bizarre incidents in modern history, as the report points out. Indonesian Navy personnel sift through a variety of personal items and wreckage from AirAsia flight QZ8501 . There were 21 fatal accidents last year – a record low at one for every 1.3 million flights – but the 986 fatalities were higher than the 10-year average largely due to two unprecedented tragedies involving Malaysia Airlines, which accounted for 537 deaths. Despite those high-profile incidents – plus last month’s deadly crash of AirAsia flight QZ8501 - the report insists air travel is the safest method of transportation. The world’s airlines carried a record 3.3 billion passengers on 27 million flights. Fifty years ago there were a staggering 87 crashes, killing 1,597 people, when airlines carried only 141 million passengers – five per cent of today’s total, the report says.","AirlineRatings.com singled out Qantas out of nearly 450 carriers .

"A private taxi firm's advert featuring a middle aged overweight woman with the caption 'if I start to look sexy, book a taxi' has been slammed as sexist. West Quay Cars in Southampton said they had put up the controversial poster as part of their festive campaign to stop people drinking and driving and to take a cab instead. But feminist campaigners said the advert, which  features the voluptuous lady in a suggestive pose next to the warning 'don't make bad decisions because you have had one too many' was sexist and are urging a boycott of the company. West Quay Cars in Southampton have come under fire for their controversial poster featuring a middle aged overweight woman with the caption 'if I start to look sexy, book a taxi' One campaigner, who wished to remain unnamed, said: 'I was horrified to see the recent posters by West Quay cars which featured a middle-aged larger woman with a slogan on it. 'It is supposed to encourage people not to drink and drive but it looked like they were telling people not to make bad decisions by going with a woman who looks like this. 'It is disgusting that in 2015 sexism is still alive, people shouldn't be making a profit over negative self-body image.' A picture of the advert posted to the University of Southampton Feminist Society's Facebook page where it was slammed as 'disgusting' and 'terrible.' Campaigners also took to Twitter to complain about the poster including Annie O'Halloran who sarcastically tweeted about the 'very charming' advert to the Everyday Sexism campaign. Feminist campaigners have slammed the advert which features the voluptuous lady in a suggestive pose next to the warning 'don't make bad decisions' as sexist and took to Twitter to complain about the advert including Annie O'Halloran who sarcastically tweeted about the 'very charming' poster . But bosses at West Quay Cars - who designed the posters themselves - said they were disappointed with the negative feedback and denied the company is sexist. They distributed 166 to pubs and clubs across Southampton as part of a festive campaign. The company said they received 16 complaints about the posters on January 1 - more than six weeks after they went on display. Manager Lee Haynes said there had no complaints about the male version of the poster which showed a man with a moustache dressed in '70s style disco clothes and open-chested shirt with the same slogan. Mr Haynes said: 'We are disappointed that our annual anti-drink drive campaign for 2014 has generated some negative feedback. 'We apologise for any offence that may have been caused by either of the posters. Bosses at West Quay Cars said there had no complaints about the male version of the poster (pictured) which shows a man dressed in '70s style disco clothes and open-chested shirt with the same slogan . 'We recognised that the campaign may be controversial, but in our opinion, our obligation to try to reduce the amount of lives devastated by drink or drug drivers ever year was overriding. 'We refute the claim that either our advertising or West Quay cars as a company is sexist or discriminatory in anyway. 'Of the 22 staff employed with the company, 16 are female and we have a diverse range of ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation within that group.' Before the campaign was launched, the firm canvassed 603 people and received only five complaints on the female poster and four complaints on the male poster. Mr Haynes added: 'We accept that we cannot please everyone all of the time. 'It is an accepted practice that annual drink drive campaigns organised by the emergency services are designed to shock. 'But no matter how displeasing the images, the message has to be delivered to eradicate deaths and injuries caused by drink driving.'","West Quay Cars put up the poster for their anti drink drive campaign .

"Rowena Browne, 33, from Cheshire, was left with a painful, oozing wound on her left cheek after a tooth abscess 'ate away' at her face . A woman claims she was left with a hole in her face when an abscess 'ate' into her cheek. Rowena Browne's left cheek turned purple and became swollen before the 33-year-old noticed a wound had opened up and was oozing pus. Miss Browne struggled to eat and suffered excruciating pain. She has since taken legal action against her dentist, who paid £11,500 but did not admit liability. 'I was struggling to eat or open my jaw properly, the wound was visibly oozing and horrible,' Miss Browne said. 'People used to do a double take when they walked past me, and I was very self-conscious at work. 'I couldn't even kiss my boyfriend.' After seeking a second opinion, she was referred to a specialist dental hospital. Miss Browne, who lives with her partner, Jonathan, 22, said: 'The swelling went down after about a month, and the wound started to heal, but the whole area was still very purple and red. 'I am having to look at a course of special fillers to try and balance it up and I may need surgery - it has been a devastating experience.' The 33-year-old, from Northwich, Cheshire, noticed a swelling in her cheek in March 2011. She visited her GP, who prescribed two courses of antibiotics. 'They thought that maybe I had a stone in my saliva duct but the swelling didn't really subside and it was becoming painful too,' she said. Miss Browne's GP then sent her to the dentist, who took X-rays and prescribed more antibiotics for a suspected abscess. After she returned to her dentist a further three times she became concerned, and made an appointment at a different dental surgery. 'By the time I saw a different dentist, my cheek was bright purple and oozing pus. It was horrible, really painful and disgusting,' Miss Browne said. 'I could only open my mouth a little so eating and talking was difficult and kissing was out of the question. 'It made my job, in customer care, almost impossible and I was so self-conscious. 'The new dentist took one look at me and demanded to know who had been treating me. 'She explained I had an abscess which had eaten into my sinus and she sent me straight to hospital to have my wisdom tooth removed.' After seeking a second opinion, Miss Browne, right with her partner, was referred  to hospital to have her wisdom tooth, left, removed. The 33-year-old was paid £11,500 in compensation by her original dentist . After surgery, Miss Browne's face was swollen for a further month, and she decided to take legal action. She recently settled the dispute with her dentist Dr Eva Quevedo, from Smiles Dental, with the dentist agreeing to pay an £11,500 settlement despite not admitting liability. Oasis Dental Care, the company that owns Smile Dental, in Barnton, Cheshire, has confirmed Dr Quevedo continues to work at the clinic. Julian Perry, Oasis Dental Care's clinical director, said: 'We are keen to reassure the public that Oasis Dental Care's number one priority is delivering clinical excellence to all patients. 'There are stringent standards in place for the recruitment and ongoing training of our dentists and other staff in order to provide exceptional care throughout Oasis. 'There have been no formal complaints raised to the General Dental Council (GDC) against the dentist, and we are working with her and the entire team at the practice to ensure that our rigorous standards in clinical excellence are met as Smiles Dental becomes part of Oasis Dental Care. 'As with all dentists working at Smiles Dental, the dentist is self-employed and continues to work at the practice.'","Rowena Browne noticed a swelling in her left cheek in March 2011 .

"Police have located a talented photographer after being impressed by the images found on a lost USB. Officers from Melbourne North Police Station appealed for the owner of the mysterious USB stick to come forward after the lost USB was handed in on Wednesday morning. They described it as 'containing stunning photographs' of India and a young man. Police are searching for the owner of a lost USB stick which they described as containing 'stunning photographs' of India and a young man . Sargent Steve Ridd told Daily Mail Australia that police didn't regularly treat seemingly mundane lost and found items with such high regard, however the USB stick appeared to be an item of high value. 'We've had a look at it and it contains a file called ""exhibition"". That's why we thought it needed to get back to the owner as soon as possible,' he said. One of the unique images shows a man rowing across a murky river, with an Indian city alight behind him – the colours reflecting across the water. Another, taken from behind a group of women walking amongst what appears to be street markets, celebrates the bright, colourful and distinctive head scarves worn by each person. The third image released by police, shows a stark red heart-shaped balloon amidst a silhouetted group of people while the final image displays a close-up of an unknown young boy. 'We've had a look at it and it contains a file called ""exhibition"". That's why we thought it needed to get back to the owner as soon as possible,'Sargent Steve Ridd said .

"The so-called Islamic State group is threatening to destroy the walls of Nineveh, the ancient capital of the Assyrian empire, in what would be its latest act of cultural vandalism. People living in the Bab Nergal area of Mosul, close to the historic site of Nineveh, said militants told them they would destroy the walls if the Iraqi army attacked, a report claims. Nineveh was once the largest city in the world, with a population of as many as 150,000 people in 700BC. Although it now lies ruins, it is still surrounded by a mostly intact 7.5-mile brick rampart. Ancient: Ruins at the ancient Assyrian city of Nineveh, which Islamic State militants have vowed to destroy when the Iraqi army comes to try to liberate Mosul, Iraq's second largest city . The Islamic State threat to destroy what remains of the historic site, reported by the Assyrian International News Agency (AINSA), comes amid a campaign of cultural vandalism by the group. Recruitment to the militants' ranks have been fuelled by ongoing sectarian conflict between Sunni and Shia Muslims in Iraq, and the group has targeted a number of Shiite shrines in areas it controls. Over the past month the Islamic State has seized hundreds of Assyrian relics from Mosul's cultural museum as well as destroyed Assyrian monuments in the city, which it claims 'distort Islam', AINSA reported. Assyrians believe themselves to be Iraq's original indigenous people, with a documented history stretching back to 4750BC. They now comprise 95 per cent of the country's Christian population. Nearly 200,000 were forced to flee their homes around the Nineveh plain last summer as Islamic State made its lightning advance across Iraq. Most now live as refugees in Iraq's Kurdish areas. Islamic State militants in Iraq's Nineveh province: Nearly 200,000 Assyrian Christians were forced to flee their homes around the Nineveh plain last summer as Islamic State made its lightning advance across Iraq . Iraqi Defence Minister Khaled al-Obeidi highlighed the importance of Mosul as he yesterday vowed the Iraqi army would soon retake the lands they lost in northern Salahuddin and Nineveh provinces. 'We will liberate it with the hard efforts of our armed forces, volunteers and with the aid of our allies,' he said. Mosul is the largest city under Islamic State control. Last week British hostage John Cantlie appeared in an Islamic State propaganda video in which he gave a tour of the city. In the bizarre documentary-style video, Mr Cantlie visits a souk (market place), a hospital and a police station in a bid to paint life in the bomb-hit city as stable. He is also seen driving a car and a police motorcycle during the eight-minute clip, which emerged on YouTube.","The walls of Nineveh, near the city of Mosul, date back nearly 3,000 years .

"A former alleged girlfriend of Prince Andrew has blasted claims an underage ‘sex slave’ was forced to sleep with him - saying the Duke is one of the 'most decent' people she knows. Former Playboy model Denise Martell claims she has been a close friend of Andrew since they were first linked in 2000, and is confident Virginia Roberts’ allegations she was forced to have sex with him in the US while aged 17 and working as a masseuse for convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein are fabricated. The scandal – first revealed in US court documents last week, in which Miss Roberts, now 30, claimed she had been forced to have sex with the prince three times between 2001 and 2002 – have been vehemently denied by Buckingham Palace. Scroll down for video . Denise Martell claims to have been a close friend of Prince Andrew for 15 years - and says he is one of the most decent people she knows . The Prince was allegedly introduced to 17-year-old Virginia Roberts by Ghislaine Maxwell, the then-girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein . Prince Andrew, pictured here in 2000, about the time he first met Denise in Los Angeles . Speaking outside her home in Malibu, California, Denise exclusively told MailOnline: 'Andrew's been a good friend of mine for 15 years and he's such a kind person and one of the most decent people I know. 'There is not an ounce of truth to these false allegations.' Glamorous Denise, 50, is the first of the women Prince Andrew has been linked to since his 1996 divorce from Sarah Ferguson to come speak out on his behalf. Fergie has already launched an impassioned defence of her ex-husband, telling reporters Andrew is 'the greatest man there is'. The Prince, 54, has also been linked to another former Playboy model, American actress Angie Everhart, bikini model Monika Jakisic and model and actress Caprice Bourret - not to mention rocker Courtney Love. So far, they have all kept quiet over the allegations. An American journalist has revealed she tried to expose Jeffrey Epstein's predatory behaviour 11 years ago - but Vanity Fair refused to print it. Vicky Ward, a contributing editor at the magazine for 11 years, was asked to profile the billionaire back in 2003. In a blog for The Daily Beast, Ms Ward - who describes Epstein as a 'Gatsby-esque character' - describes how she was made uncomfortable almost immediately. 'Epstein had invited me to an off-the-record tea at his Upper East Side house (during which I distinctly remember he rudely ate all the finger food himself) and then had his assistant call to tell me he’d thought I was pretty,' she recalls. But it wasn't the unwanted compliment which worried her: it was - among other things - a conversation she had with a mother of a 16-year-old Epstein had allegedly molested. 'He’d gotten to them because of his money,' Ms Ward wrote, adding: 'The girls’ mother told me by phone that she had thought her daughters would be safe under Epstein’s roof, not least because he phoned her to reassure her, and she also knew he had Ghislaine Maxwell with him at all times.' But when she tried to include the account in her final piece, it was pulled. A Vanity Fair spokesman told the Daily Beast the decision was taken because “Epstein denied the charges at the time and since the claims were unsubstantiated and no criminal investigation had been initiated, we decided not to include them in what was a financial story”. But Ms Ward - who said Epstein had 'a way of spooking you' - says it wasn't a financial piece - adding: 'it has often struck me that if my piece had named the women, the FBI might have come after Epstein sooner and perhaps some of his victims, now, in the latest spate of allegations, allegedly either paid off or too fearful of retribution to speak up, would have been saved.' However, it was Denise who forewarned of a lack of security around Andrew, when she met him during one of his business trips as an official representative of Britain in 2000. These trips would later prove controversial after it was alleged he was using taxpayers’ money to fund a lavish lifestyle while on official business. Denise met Andrew in Los Angeles, where they are said to have had a three-day romance, during which he invited her to his room alone on two consecutive nights. Speaking in 2001, Denise said: 'The nights I was alone with him in his room he never had any security with him. 'I had only just met him. But I walked straight to his room. I knocked on the door and he opened it. Party: Dara Preece Gehringer (above) said she met Prince Andrew in the exclusive resort in St Tropez . 'He'd given me his room number, his code name, his private mobile phone number, everything. 'He gave the mobile number to me on the first night after I'd only known him a few hours. There was never any security there. I was very surprised. I was shocked. The President would never have been left alone like that. I was worried for him.' During their time together, the Prince was said to have stripped to his boxer shorts and allowed Denise - who now works for Diane Warren’s music publishing company, Real Songs – to tuck him into bed. Denise's support for Andrew follows hot on the heels of one of Epstein's troupe of girls saying she was 'dumbfounded’ by claims the Prince abused a girl at an under-age orgy. Dara Preece Gehringer told how she was one of a group of young women flown by the billionaire on his private jet to St Tropez in Southern France for an evening of entertainment in 2001. ‘I flew on Jeffrey’s private jet and we had dinner with Andrew,' Miss Gehringer revealed. 'He seemed relaxed. He was wonderful and a gentleman.’ She described Miss Roberts’ claims as ‘extremely unlikely’, telling the Mail: ‘I’m dumbfounded. I can’t believe he took part in anything like that. That’s my opinion. He was nothing but pleasant to me.’ ‘If everything that went down the way she said, I just have a hard time believing it because they (Epstein and his friends) are not people like that.’ In 2011, Andrew, fifth in line to the British throne, stepped down from his role as UK Special Representative for Trade and Investment over his friendship with Epstein, who by that time was a convicted sex offender. Epstein, 61, a billionaire financier, completed 13 months in jail on a charge of soliciting sex with an underage girl after striking a plea deal in 2008. Despite Epstein’s conviction he was photographed walking with Andrew in Central Park, New York, after his release. Jeffrey Epstein and ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell are both named in the legal papers lodged in America . Epstein also stands accused of trying to cover up his actions by tracking down witnesses and warning them against testifying against him. However, Miss Roberts and four alleged other victims – who have not been identified – continue to make allegations against Epstein. Epstein has denied the claims, saying they are made up. Miss Roberts claims she was recruited to be a personal ‘masseuse’ to the disgraced tycoon when she was just 15 and that she was abused by ‘royalty’, ‘politicians’ and ‘academicians’ while under his employment. She subsequently moved to Australia, married and had three children, but later returned to the US where she co-operate with the FBI investigating Epstein’s dealings. She said in 2011: ‘I am anxious. I am still frightened of him because he has so much power. I had to put this behind me. 'But in the end this is not for me. It’s because I’m afraid there are a lot of girls still doing what I did for him, eight years after I left. I want to be the one who breaks the chain.’ There is no suggestion Andrew was aware of any pressure being exerted on Miss Roberts, who has gone into hiding in Colorado since her explosive claims about Andrew and Epstein were filed at a courthouse in Palm Beach, Florida, last week.

"It is not every day you see a man walking around a cathedral square with a smile on his face and a full-grown sheep on his shoulders. Sinister-looking black-clad riders dance stallions on their hind legs in the middle of a 20,000-strong crowd. The bravest or most foolhardy revellers dash forward to touch the horses' hearts for luck. The annual fiesta of Sant Joan in the ancient city of Ciutadella, on Menorca's west coast, features many bizarre rituals. Strangers fuelled by pomada, the local version of gin and bitter lemon, pelt you with hazelnuts (it's a sign of love, apparently). Peace and quiet, pictured: Menorca revels in quiet coves, little beaches and turquoise seas . If you jump three times over a bonfire, you can turn a bad year into a good one (useful in the Spanish economic climate). When it comes to celebrating the summer solstice, Menorca is the place to be. Sant Joan is the Catalan name of St John the Baptist and we're celebrating his June birthday, although the fiesta has much older pagan origins. Horseplay: The festival of Sant Joan is a major tradition on Menorca, with equine stunts to the fore . Menorca is the poorest and least known of the Balearic islands. We all know about Mallorca with its many hotels and reputation, in places such as Magaluf, for alcohol-fuelled package tour excesses. Ibiza has the coolest clubs and celebrity second-homers such as James Blunt, Liam Gallagher, Jade Jagger and Elle Macpherson. Mellow little Menorca is the Balearics' shy relation, positively introverted in comparison with its neighbours - and all the better for it. At last, I've found a holiday destination in the western Mediterranean that is almost entirely unspoilt by 60 years of mass tourism. The first charter flights landed here in 1953, but when you arrive by air in the capital, Mahon (or Mao in Catalan) nowadays, it comes as a welcome shock to see that almost the entire island is made up of fields and woodland, with just two small cities and a few pods of white villas scattered around the coastline. In 1993, UNESCO declared the island one of the world's 400 'biosphere reserves'. Curiously, the Menorcans have Generalissimo Franco to thank for this. In retribution for the little island's Republican stance during the Spanish Civil War, the fascist dictator spent the next 36 years denying Menorca access to public building funds. As a happy result, it escaped the high-rise concrete epidemic that blighted the mainland costas. A quaint sort of calm: The Menorcan capital Ciutadella sits prettily on the west coast of the island . Menorca is just half the size of the Isle of Wight. In the middle lies El Toro, a 1,000 ft hill with a church, a Franciscan convent and tremendous views. To the east lies Mahon with its deep natural harbour, imposing Georgian buildings and narrow cobbled alleyways. In the west, you can glimpse Ciutadella. The varietyof buildings in Mahon reflects the list of invaders, including Turkish pirates, who have invaded and occupied its streets down the centuries. Our own Admiral John Byng was executed by firing squad for losing Menorca to the French in 1756. Georgian architecture apart, our legacy was gin - distilled to this day by Xoriguer on the harbour in Mahon. Busy resorts like Cala Galdana, Arenal d'en Castell and Punta Prima have enough activities to satisfy even the most lively, though for the first couple of days I found it hard to choose between flopping by the pool and basking on the sands. Most of the best beaches, such as Cala Macarella, Son Saura and Cala Pregonda, are tucked away in isolated coves along the 116-mile coastline. The Camí de Cavalls, an ancient bridleway, encircles the island, and can be explored on foot, by bicycle or, naturally, on horseback. Take a walk with me: Ciutadella is an inviting place for an evening meal or a gentle stroll when dusk falls . Menorca bears the brunt of winds sweeping in from the Atlantic and Fornells, on the north coast, which is the best place for sailing and windsurfing. It is also an attractive town with boutiques, a craft market and restaurants. Inexpensive Sa Taula (+34 619 432 291) has folk music and tapas such as courgette carpaccio, along with mussels poached in port. The seafront in Fornells has plenty of fish restaurants and you might consider spending €40 to €60 (£31-£47 on a feast of caldereta de langosta, a spicy lobster stew. Fishermen used to eat this at sea because lobster was the only seafood that had no commercial value. These days, sadly, the lobster in question may be sourced from Cornwall or Cardigan Bay, so I'd recommend a short trip along the coast to the bistro El Castillo (+34 971 35855) at Addaia for the finest fresh fish, at more reasonable prices. For a romantic off-season break or a full-on family beach holiday, unspoilt Menorca is hard to beat. Sovereign Luxury Travel (0843 770 4526, www.sovereign.com) offers seven nights at the four-star Audax Spa and Wellness Centre in Cala Galdana from £569 per person half-board, including Gatwick flights, airport lounge access and transfers.","Menorca is smaller and far less developed than its big neighbour Mallorca .

"Sportsman-turned-politician Imran Khan will formally announce his marriage on Friday, sources at a Pakistani television station have said. It is understood Khan's new wife Reham - the former BBC weather girl he wed in secret last month - has invited colleagues to the announcement. A source at Dawn TV, the private news channel where she works, also revealed the new Mrs Khan has also invited her make up artist to Friday's event, although Mr Khan officially confirmed they were married yesterday. The source added: 'She has also shown willingness to start her regular programme for TV from next week.' Scroll down for video . Ms Khan, a divorced mother-of-three, was a BBC weather girl but is now a news anchor of AAJ TV . Imran Khan arrives at Heathrow Airport last week when, at the time, he said rumours he had married were 'greatly exaggerated' The formal announcement comes after a turbulent week for the couple, who have incited the wrath of Mr Khan's family and the wider public in Pakistan. Yesterday, a friend of Mrs Khan, 41, told how she was suffering emotional turmoil after being trolled over her marriage to the Pakistani cricketer-turned-politician. Some social media users have accused the divorced mother-of-three of being a lesbian and one image even claims to show her in a sex shop. A producer at Dawn TV told MailOnline that the backlash had left the broadcaster 'very disturbed'. The source said: 'She is not in the right state of mind after seeing the reaction of trolls on social media after news of her marriage with Imran Khan was disclosed. 'She has not been conducting her daily programme as well. She is very disturbed by the way she is being portrayed on social media.' Denial: Imran Khan's sister Aleema said the family had a showdown with the politician and he denied the secret marriage . It came as Mr Khan spoke out against the storm surrounding his  wedding, telling his critics that marriage is not a crime. His sister Aleena reacted with anger at the news, saying she doesn't want to meet the new Mrs Khan. Told by MailOnline that her brother had revealed he was actually married, Aleema Khan - who claimed the rumours were started by opposition politicians looking to discredit her brother - said: 'Really? Really? Let's see if he announces it officially. I am taken aback. 'This is a real challenge for him. We haven't met her and I don't know that we want to meet her. 'It is his decision, he is a grown up. It is more important how the children feel. 'I suppose in any situation like this the children will not feel good about it. They do look up to their father.' Speaking amid a political storm surrounding rumours of the marriage, she said she hoped Reham Khan 'will be good for Pakistan and our brother'. She added: 'It all depends on how the public respond to it. The biggest surprise is how everybody in Pakistan feels they have a right to participate in the decision. 'He is a grown man, we are watching the situation unfold.' But speaking from his home in Islamabad today, Mr Khan launched a robust defence of his actions and of his new bride, declaring: 'A person can marry whenever he/she wants.' He pointed to the fact that he had in no way deceived his wife and insisted that he put his two teenage children first when coming to a decision. The 62-year-old said: 'I didn't think of my marriage for 10 years after my divorce because my children were small. I do not ever think of hurting my children's feelings.' 'I hope he will be happy': Jemima Goldsmith, the ex-wife of Imran Khan, has offered her congratulations to the former cricketer 'on this new phase in his life' after he announced his marriage to a former BBC weather girl . After the wedding was officially confirmed by Khan yesterday following days of speculation, Ms Goldsmith took to Twitter to express her happiness for the newlyweds . Khan's ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith has been among those to offer her congratulations to the former cricketer. She tweeted: 'I hope Imran will be happy in this new phase of his life.' Ms Goldsmith, who divorced Khan in 2004 after nine years of marriage and has two teenage sons with him, also spoke of her fondness for Pakistan. Ms Goldsmith revealed in October that she was ditching the surname 'Khan' and reverting to her family name because her ex-husband was about to remarry. She said at the time: 'My ex-husband, Imran, recently announced that he intended to get remarried soon, which made me think it's probably time to change my name back to Goldsmith.' Khan married Ms Goldsmith in a traditional Islamic ceremony in Paris in 1995. What Mrs Khan's former in-laws think of the marriage is less clear. Reham, who was born in Libya to Pakistani parents, has three children from her previous marriage to a doctor. Fazlur Rehman, her ex-father-in-law, a retired major in the Pakistan army, refused to speak to reporters when they approached him. Pakistan cricketer-turned politician Imran Khan speaks out against his critics in a press conference at his home in Islamabad (left) after secretly marrying former BBC weather girl Reham Khan (right) 'A person can marry whenever he/she wants:' Mr Khan launched a robust defence of his actions and of his new bride after reaction to the marriage was negative in Pakistan and on social media . Mr Khan insisted that he put his two teenage children first when coming to a decision about marriage . Reham Khan is understood to have moved into the house with her youngest daughter, according to her former colleague and friend. The Daily Mail's diarist Sebastian Shakespeare broke the news of Khan's marriage to the broadcaster last week. On New Year's Eve, Mr Khan said rumours of marriage were 'greatly exaggerated' and his sister Aleema said the family challenged him 'a few days ago' over the news and he denied it. But speaking to reporters at Heathrow airport last night before boarding a flight to Pakistan, Khan is reported to have said: 'I am going to Pakistan to share good news about my marriage with the nation. I have nothing to hide.' More details are beginning to emerge about the marriage - including the fact it was presided over by Mufti Saeed, said to be a leading Islamic scholar. Mufti Saeed is understood to have been arrested after a failed  plot by Islamic militants within the Pakistan army, according to the Telegraph. Mufti Saeed has neither denied nor admitted that he was the person who oversaw the marriage. However, he told a MailOnline source people would soon learn about the wedding. The contact claimed that Mufti Saeed was selected a member of core committee of PTI after his service for Imran. The 41-year-old lived in Britain for part of her previous marriage, when she was a weather girl and presenter on BBC regional news programme South Today .","Pakistani politician wed divorced mum-of-three Reham Khan in secret .

'I start with the dogs on a lead so that they can get used to walking and gradually remove the leads one-by-one. 'The dogs all know they must remain in the same position and not change the formation. 'A lot of people are shocked; they can't believe that so many dogs can walk through the city in a group, off the leash. 'Some people are afraid of German Shepherds but lose that fear when they see my dogs because they can tell they are focused and well behaved. 'Overall I get a variety of different reactions from people. In general they are very impressed and it makes their day.' Bostonian Susan Wray Danowitz, who was shopping and saw Augusto and his pack, said: 'I have two dogs that are horribly behaved and would love to have them behave like Augusto's.

"The battle of the mortgage lenders intensified yesterday as a ten-year fixed-rate deal plunged below 3 per cent for the first time. Barclays slashed its decade-long offer to 2.99 per cent as banks and building societies continued to cut rates across the board. Ten-year fixed-rate mortgages have surged in popularity as the interest rates payable on them tumble to ‘remarkable’ new lows, experts said. Barclays slashed its decade-long offer to 2.99 per cent as banks and building societies continued to cut rates across the board . Homebuyers looking for long-term security are locking into fixed deals after competition between banks and building societies made the traditionally expensive option suddenly more affordable. Lenders are now able to offer rock-bottom rates after economists widely predicted the Bank of England would not raise its base rate from its historic low of 0.5 per cent until as late as next year. Ten-year deals give homebuyers the peace of mind of knowing that, should interest rates rise sharply, they will be locked into repayments that they are able to afford. Some may have been burned by escalating rates in the 1980s and 1990s when they reached highs of up to 16 per cent, experts said. The number of decade-long fixed rates on the market has ballooned from eight to 77 in the past year, according to the financial services comparison website Moneyfacts. Interest rates on these deals have also been cut dramatically from an average of 4.64 per cent in November 2013 to 4.17 per cent this month. Barclays yesterday announced the UK’s lowest ever ten-year fixed-rate mortgage at 2.99 per cent, including a £999 fee, for buyers with at least a 40 per cent deposit. This was previously available at 3.45 per cent. Eleanor Todorova, of mortgage brokers John Charcol, said: ‘Ten-year fixed rates have become dramatically more competitive. ‘A year ago there were only a few deals on the market, but the number of lenders entering the ten-year market has been quite amazing, as well as the value for money they represent. ‘I think current expectations that the base rate will probably not rise for a year have contributed to the remarkable rates on offer.’ Sylvia Waycot, of Moneyfacts, said that while most homebuyers sought the flexibility of a two-year or five-year deal, ten-year deals were now ‘cheaper than ever before’. She said: ‘Fixing your mortgage for a decade at this exceptionally low rate has got to be of interest to a lot of people.’ The Barclays deal applies only to those with a large deposit, so is more likely to be taken up by second and third-time buyers. However, Miss Waycot warned that homebuyers should look for a portable deal without high exit fees that allows them to transfer their mortgage if they move, and check if there are high charges should they need to borrow more money or want to repay their mortgage sooner.","Barclays slashed its decade-long mortgage to 2.99 per cent interest .

"FBI Director James Comey says he's confident that North Korea was behind the cyberattack on Sony. Comey said Wednesday that threats made against Sony were traced to IP addresses used exclusively by the North Koreans, at a cybersecurity conference at New York's Fordham University. Comey also said there was evidence that North Korea had sought to use proxy servers to conceal the Sony hack but they sometimes 'got sloppy' and didn't use the servers - and that they would strike again. These claims just raise more questions however for one cyber expert, Marc Rogers. Scroll down for video . Revelation: James Comey (file photo above) said Wednesday that he is ceratin North Korea is behind the Sony hack . Motivation: It is believed by the FBI that the hack begun over North Korea's disapproval of the Sony film The Interview (above) 'The Guardians of Peace would send emails threatening Sony employees and post online various statements explaining their work. In nearly every case they would use proxy servers in sending those emails and posting those statements,' said Comey. 'But several times they got sloppy. Several times, either because they forgot or they had a technical problem, they connected directly and we could see it.' He also added; 'We could see that the IP addresses they used ... were IPs that were exclusively used by the North Koreans. It was a mistake by them. It was a very clear indication of who was doing this. They would shut it off very quickly once they realized the mistake, but not before we saw them and knew where it was coming from.' Working as both the director of security operations for DEF CON, the world’s largest hacker conference, and the principal security researcher for global CDN and DNS provider Cloudflare, Rogers may be one of the foremost experts when it comes to hacking. 'It is certainly interesting stuff and adds a bit more color to the attack, but nothing he said conclusively ties it to the North Koreans,' said Rogers. 'For example when he says IP addresses exclusively used by North Korea, what does he actually mean?' he asks. 'When he says emails and messages, what messages and how does he know they weren't fake or bounced off of other servers to hide their origin?' He then went on to say, 'How do we even know the emails that look like a slip-up were even sent by the attackers? Anyone could have sent them pretending to be Guardians of Peace.' Rogers had previously voiced his problems with the FBI's claims against North Korea back in December in a piece her wrote for The Daily Beast. The first FBI claim that Rogers tore down also happened to be one the strongest that the FBI had, saying in their statement; 'The malware used in this attack revealed links to other malware that the FBI knows North Korean actors previously developed.' There were two problems with this according to Rogers, and both had to do with the bureau basing their findings on assumptions as opposed to fact. First, while a similar malware may have been used in a previous cyber attack that North Korea has been linked to, that does not serve as definitive proof that this attack was carried out by North Korea. Rogers then further chipped away at their statement, pointing out that he and many security experts do not believe North Korea was involved in those previous incidents, whose coding the FBI is referencing to tie the attacks together. What's more, the coding for one of the two malwares, Shamoon, was leaked according to Rogers, and would not be difficult for any hacker to find. He then took aim at the FBI conclusion that since the IP addresses used in the attack are addresses used by North Korea in previous attacks, they must be responsible. According to Rogers, the reasoning is flawed as these addresses are used by everyone from major hackers to even small time Internet criminals to avoid detection, meaning these addresses could tie virtually anyone in the hacking community, or even someone using stolen credit cards to shop online and avoid detection, to the attack. Then, there is the fact that the demand by the hacking group, who call themselves the Guardians of Peace, that the The Interview not be released was not announced until weeks into the hack, and only after some members of the media had begun to perpetuate the now widely accepted story that the goal of the hack was to make sure The Interview would never be distributed by Sony. Rogers pointed all this out again on Wednesday after seeing the new FBI claims, saying; 'We have already seen the FBI send out a flash alert to media organizations based on one spoof.'","FBI Director James Comey said in a speech Wednesday that he's confident that North Korea was behind the cyberattack on Sony .

"Tamara Ecclestone loves bags. Particularly Hermes Birkin bags. But even her billionaire father - Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone, Britain's fourth richest man  sometimes feels her bag-buying habit is getting out of hand. Speaking to InStyle magazine, the socialite - whose estimated worth is £300m - said: 'Sometimes he's like, ""Another handbag, Tamara? That's a bit nuts""...I think he's glad that I'm not hurting other people. I've never been to rehab. It could be worse.' Tamara Ecclestone standing in the shoe section of her walk-in wardrobe  - home to over 120 pairs of Louboutins - in her current home in Chelsea . Ecclestone, 28, is standing inside her legendary walk-in wardrobe, a multi-room experience in her Chelsea home that is stuffed to bursting with designer garments, accessories, shoes and bags. In the shoe section there are over 120 pairs of Louboutin heels - an average cost of £500 each. And she has a glass cabinet reserved exclusively for some 30 Hermes Birkins in every colour of the rainbow - bags which routinely sell for between £5,000 and £100,000. But soon Ecclestone will be packing all her glittering possessions into boxes (or, rather, she'll be paying someone else to do it), and leaving the house that has a swimming pool in the sitting room...for one that has a nightclub in her basement, a bowling alley and a million pound bathtub. She and her dogs - Alvin, Puggle Socky, Buster, Hob Nob and Duke - will be relocating to the £45m Kensington mansion (complete with £18m of refurbishments) she bought for herself and her now ex-boyfriend, stockbroker Omar Khyami, 38. Tamara plans to give her collection of some 30 Hermes Birkin bags - which sell for between £6,000 and £100,000 - to a daughter if she has one . The couple broke up in August after she discovered he had been involved in a sex tape, but Ecclestone is just relieved the couple didn't get married or have any children, and is excited about the future. Explaining that will 'never ever ever' speak to Khyami again, she said: 'It's a new beginning. Perfect timing. And when I'm ready, I'll meet a new man.'

"Private Eye editor Ian Hislop said the victims of the Charlie Hebdo shooting had 'paid a very high price for exercising their comic liberty'. The satirical magazine targeted by three masked gunmen is widely seen as France's answer to Private Eye and prides itself on a mixture of tongue-in-cheek reporting and investigative journalism. At least 12 people died in the attack, believed to include editorial staff members Jean Cabu, Stephane 'Charb' Charbonnier, Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac and Bernard Maris. Scroll down for video . Private Eye editor Ian Hislop said the victims of the Charlie Hebdo shooting had 'paid a very high price for exercising their comic liberty' Gunmen brandishing Kalashnikovs burst into the Charlie Hebdo headquarters, opening fire on staff after seeking out journalists by name. Those executed included four of the most famous cartoonists in France – men who had regularly satirised Islam and the Prophet Mohammed – including the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Stephane Charbonnier. In a statement, journalist and writer Mr Hislop said: 'I am appalled and shocked by this horrific attack - a murderous attack on free speech in the heart of Europe. 'I offer my condolences to the families and friends of those killed - the cartoonists, journalists and those who were trying to protect them. 'They paid a very high price for exercising their comic liberty.' He added: 'Very little seems funny today.' The editor-in-chief of British satire website The Daily Mash has also spoken of his shock at the Charlie Hebdo terror attack. Neil Rafferty said he and the website's team of writers felt the murderous attack was 'beyond belief'. He said that his site, which has already expressed solidarity with the French magazine on Twitter and Facebook, was planning its own response. The former news journalist said: 'We are a little bit shocked. I think me and the writers think it is beyond belief really. 'You think if it is possible that these sorts of extremists would turn their guns on writers and satirists. It seems such an extreme possibility that when it happens it shocks you to the core.' The massacre this morning was France's deadliest terror attack in at least two decades. Witnesses said the suspect Al Qaeda killers were heard to shout 'the Prophet has been avenged' and 'Allahu akbar!' as they stalked the building. Horrific footage also emerged showing an injured police officer slumped on the pavement outside the office as two of the gunmen approach. Charlie Hebdo's editor-in-chief, Gerard Biard, who was in London at the time of the attack, said: 'I don't understand how people can attack a newspaper with heavy weapons. A newspaper is not a weapon of war.' Twitter users have begun using the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag in a show of solidarity with the publication. Magazine Charlie Hebdo has taken several highly provocative swipes at Islam. The magazine once named Prophet Mohammed as its guest editor, published cartoons of the holy figure in the nude, and once renamed itself Sharia Hebdo with the cover slogan '100 lashes if you don't die of laughter'. The controversy began in 2006 when the publication reprinted now-infamous cartoons of Prophet Mohammed by Danish artist Kurt Westergaard. When the images originally appeared they lead to days of protests across the Middle East and in Western cities. The decision to reprint the images landed the then-editor in court under anti-terror laws, though he was later acquitted. Stephane Charbonnier, who was among the 12 people killed, was the editor-in-chief of Charlie Hebdo which regularly satirised Islam and the Prophet Mohammed . British tourists in Paris have been warned to take 'extra care' in the wake of the terrorist gun attack in the French capital which left 12 people dead. The Foreign Office said those in the French capital should be more vigilant because of the 'high threat from terrorism' in the country. It is understood he will order a meeting of Cobra to be held tomorrow. Scotland Yard is in discussions with the government about the public response expected later. Whitehall sources expect police, security services and senior politicians including the Home Secretary Theresa May to hold talks to discuss Britain's response to the attack. Britain's terror threat level is currently set at 'severe' but the question of increasing to 'critical', the highest state of alert, is likely to be discussed. It was last raised to critical in 2007 in the wake of terror attacks in London and Glasgow, and indicates an extremely high level of threat. The Foreign Office  updated its travel advice to state: 'If you're in Paris or the Ile de France area, take extra care and follow the security advice issued by the French authorities. 'There is a high threat from terrorism. Attacks could be indiscriminate. Due to ongoing threats to France by Islamist groups, and recent French military intervention against ISIL, the French government has warned the public to be especially vigilant and has reinforced its own domestic and overseas security measures. 'Previous incidents attributed to Islamist extremists have included the shooting of 3 soldiers and 4 civilians in Toulouse, and a knife attack on a soldier near Paris.' The Hebdo offices were burned to the ground in 2011 when attackers used Molotov cocktails to start a blaze early in the morning of November 2. There was nobody in the building at the time, and the target was instead thought to be the magazine's computer system, which was completely destroyed. Riot police were forced to stand guard outside the building for days following the attack, as the editors took a defiant stance, choosing to reprint the cartoon images multiple times. In 2012 they again printed cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed as a deliberately provocative gesture while violent protests were taking place across the Middle East. The following year the magazine's office again had to be surrounded by riot officers after they published a cartoon booklet depicting the Prohpet naked as a baby and being pushed in a wheelchair. On the final page of the booklet there was a note from the editor, Stephane Charbonnier, saying the images were 'halal' because Muslims had worked on them, and that they were factually accurate as they had been derived from descriptions in the Koran. Hebdo's current office building has no notices on the door to prevent a repeat of the attacks that have occurred in the past. In an interview with De Volkskrant in January 2013, Mr Charbonnier revealed he had been placed under constant police protection for four months after one of the cartoon issues was published. He shrugged off criticism that he was only publishing the images to gain notoriety for Hebdo, and insisted that he was instead defending the right to free speech. Mr Charbonnier pointed out that the magazine had poked fun at feminism, nuclear energy and homeland security, but the Islam issues always attracted the most publicity. Prime Minister David Cameron said Britain stands 'united with the French people' in opposition to terrorists and defending free speech and democracy. He told MPs: 'While details are still unclear I know that this house and this country stands united with the French people in our opposition to all forms of terrorism and we stand squarely for free speech and democracy. 'These people will never take us off those values.' In a statement the Queen said: 'Prince Philip and I send our sincere condolences to the families of those who have been killed and to those who have been injured in the attack in Paris this moming. 'We send our thoughts and prayers to all those who have been affected.' Mr Cameron, who is to be briefed by security services tonight, will call French President Francois Hollande  to offer British condolences and solidarity. It is understood he will order a meeting of Cobra to be held tomorrow. Scotland Yard is in discussions with the government about the public response expected later. Whitehall sources expect police, security services and senior politicians including the Home Secretary Theresa May to hold talks to discuss Britain's response to the attack.

Two masked men brandishing Kalashnikovs burst into the magazine's headquarters this morning, opening fire on staff. Police officers were involved in a gunfight with the men, who escaped in a hijacked car, speeding away towards east Paris and remain on the loose, along with a third armed man. Charbonnier, 47, known by his pen name Charb, was the editor of the weekly magazine. Cabut, also called Cabu, its lead cartoonist and Wolinski an 80-year-old satirist who had been drawing cartoons since the 1960s.

"Ben Carson, the African-American former pediatric neurosurgeon whose conservative speeches have rallied the Republican Party's right wing, was accused Tuesday of plagiarizing portions of a best-selling book he wrote in 2012. The revelation will prove embarrassing to the probable 2016 presidential contender: In the same book Carson describes being caught plagiarizing part of an assignment during his college years. In that case, the professor forgave him and allowed him to resubmit his paper; American voters may not be as flexible. 'America the Beautiful' contains several passages lifted from other books, from a conservative website, from press releases and from an American television network, according to the entertainment websiteBuzzfeed. DR. PLAGIARISM? Ben Carson, a rare black luminary among the Republican Party's likely presidential condenders, stands accused or ripping parts of his 2012 book from other publications . Carson is being urged to run for the White House by a 'draft' movement that includes a $12 million political action committee . The largest apparent offense involves 156 words from SocialismSucks.net which appeared in the book verbatim. In another, 106 words from a 2011 press release issued by the Liberty Institute, a religious freedom group, appeared in Carson's book with only minor alterations – and no citation. THE BOOK: Buzzfeed scoured 'America the Beautiful' and found numerous instances of apparent plagiarism . And 23 words from a CBS News online article about a 2010 'national day of prayer' also appear nearly identical in his text. US district judge Barbara Crabb, according to both, 'ruled that the government-sanctioned [event], established by Congress and marked with a proclamation from the president, is unconstitutional.' Other instances cited by Buzzfeed are more benign, however, including several taken from books whose author, noted conservative historian Bill Federer, expressly gave permission for others to use the text. Still more are picayune by comparison, consisting of casual rearrangement of text – but lack the footnotes and acknowledgements that are customary in nonfiction publishing. 'In many cases Carson cites the works that he plagiarizes in endnotes,' Buzzfeed reported, 'though he makes no effort to indicate that not just the source, but the words themselves, had been taken from different authors.' Federer's book grants permission 'to duplicate 10,000 words or less, provided acknowledgement is given.' Carson's original text from 'America the Beautiful' makes it clear that he's aware of the need to carefully vet writing for the unauthorized use of other authors' work. In college, he recalls, he 'found some passages that seemed particularly appropriate' to a psychology paper he was writing, 'and I included them in my writing. I did not, however, indicate that this was the work of someone else; frankly, I had never even heard of the term plagiarism.' With a lesson learned, his 'compassionate' professor allowed him to re-submit his paper. 'I certainly should have known inherently that what I was doing was wrong. I had done it before without consequences and probably would have continued doing it if I had not been caught,' Carson wrote in the 2012 book. 'This raises another question: Is ignorance an acceptable excuse for unethical behavior?' The Buzzfeed reporter who unearthed the Carson plagiarism did not immediately respond to an email asking whether other political authors' texts might be on the chopping block. The website has already skewered Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, another shoo-in for the 2016 White House race, for plagiarism. In his 2012 book 'Government Bullies,' Paul lifted entire sections of text from papers issued years earlier by conservative think tanks including the Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute. His publisher updated the book's future editions with footnotes. IN YOUR FACE: Carson compared Obamacare to slavery in 2013 as the president looked on . Carson, a world-renowned pediatric neurosurgeon, is reportedly gearing up for a presidential run in 2016 as a Republican . An Iowa political consultant who worked for two separate GOP campaigns in 2012 told DailyMail.com that this will be the beginning of the end for Carson. 'He's basically toast,' the operative said Wednesday. 'Rand Paul can recover from this because he's in the news and he's a senator. Carson can't.' 'And his whole shtick is being a doctor, an academic. How does he explain this away?' He asked not to be identified because he doesn't want to 'limit options' for employment in the coming campaign season.

"David Cameron has distanced himself from Prince Andrew by refusing to publicly back the royal over allegations that he sexually abused a teenager. Asked about the claims, which were made against the Duke of York last week, the Prime Minister replied: 'I'm not going to make any comment on it. 'Obviously, the Prince has made his own views very, very clear, and I think I'll leave it at that.' David Cameron (right) has refused to publicly give his backing to Prince Andrew (left), who is accused of sexually abusing a teenager . The extraordinary allegation was made by Virginia Roberts (pictured) as part of a U.S civil case against convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, a close friend of Prince Andrew . It came as veteran Labour MP Paul Flynn, who sits on the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the royal still had questions to answer. Mr Flynn told The Daily Mirror: 'Prince Andrew must not be above the law. He has been unwise generally in his choice of friends and exposed himself to public suspicion. 'He should have broke any links with a convicted child sex offender.' Mr Cameron's comments, made during a radio interview yesterday, showed a marked change from his reaction when the Duke's friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein first caused controversy in 2011. At the time, Mr Cameron's spokesman said the Duke was 'doing an important job' and that 'we support him in his role as trade envoy'. Despite the backing, the Duke ultimately resigned as Special Representative for UK Trade and Investment. In court papers which emerged on Friday, Andrew has been accused of abusing a girl 'procured' for him by his close friend Epstein. The Duke of York and and Epstein were pictured walking together in Central Park after the disgraced tycoon had served just 13 months in jail . Prince Andrew pictured in 2001 with Virginia Roberts, who claims in court she was forced to have sex with him three times while underage . The extraordinary allegation was made by Virginia Roberts as part of a US civil case against shamed billionaire Epstein. She claims Prince Andrew had sex with her when she was 17 - a minor under US law - and employed as a 'sex slave' by Epstein. Buckingham Palace has strenuously denied the allegations in three statements. Yesterday, Boris Johnson gave the Duke his support, saying he had 'sympathy' for the father-of-two. Speaking on LBC radio, he said: 'Prince Andrew, let's be very clear, is a guy who does a huge amount of unsung, unheralded work for this country. London Mayor Boris Johnson expressed sympathy for Prince Andrew over the sex allegations in a US court. The two men are pictured at an event in London in 2013 . 'People, they go on and and about the air miles and so on, actually I have seen that guy get out there and sell this country, try and help British firms to get business around the world. 'He does a huge amount of good and a huge amount of hard work. So if you are asking me whether I have sympathy for him, of course I do.' Mr Johnson added: 'We may think it's bizarre, but somebody who is the second son of the Queen is felt in many parts of the world to be an interesting and significant figure and they will receive him cordially and people who come with him they want to hear what business suggestions they have. 'So I think that people should respect that side of his work.' Sarah Ferguson has already launched an extraordinary defence of her former husband Prince Andrew, describing him as 'the greatest man there is'. Sarah Ferguson launched a strong defence of her ex-husband, Prince Andrew, insisting: 'He is the greatest man there is' The Duchess of York declined to comment directly on the scandal engulfing her former husband. But, when asked by the Daily Mail if she was sticking by the Duke, she replied: 'The York family is a tight unit. We've always been a tight unit. 'He is the greatest man there is. It was the finest moment of my life in 1986 when I married him. He is a great man, the best man in the world.' Andrew, who spent last week holidaying in a chalet in Verbier the chalet, flew back to the UK by private jet on Sunday afternoon with Eugenie. Sources say there are no immediate plans for him to travel to Norfolk, where the Queen is in residence until early February. However, it was indicated they had spoken by phone.

"A prized pig owned by Princess Anne has been killed by a wild boar after he broke into the pen at her home. The attack came just hours after another wild boar caused an accident which killed a man on the M4, 15 miles away. Anne’s beloved Gloucestershire Old Spot was killed on Tuesday night at her Gatcombe Park estate in Gloucestershire. Scroll down for video . Sad day: Princess Anne, pictured at Gatcombe Park, lost one of her favourite animals - her pig . The Queen’s daughter is particularly passionate about the rare breed and in 2009 became patron of the Gloucestershire Old Spots Pig Breeders’ Club. She revealed details of the attack during a speech to the Oxford Farming Conference yesterday, telling delegates: ‘We had a visit last night on our farm from a wild boar. 'My Gloucestershire Old Spot boar is no longer with us as a result.’ Like Prince Charles, Anne is a keen farmer and has kept pigs at Gatcombe for many years. On Monday night, a man died in a crash on the M4 when his car collided with a wild boar and was subsequently hit by a lorry. The incident has renewed fears that Britain’s wild boar population – believed to run into the hundreds – is out of control. Wild boar can weigh up to 20 stone when fully grown, run up to 30mph and are able to jump as high as 6ft to get over barriers. Prized possession: The rare Gloucester Old Spot (not pictured) killed by a wild boar that managed to break into the pig's pen on Princess Anne's estate in Stroud . Bacon fan: Princess Anne, pictured at Gatcombe Park last year, is the patron of the Gloucestershire Old Spots Pig Breeders’ Club . Killer: The wild boar (not pictured) broke into the pen and killed the treasured pig . They were hunted to extinction in Britain hundreds of years ago but have had a resurgence since farming them became fashionable in the 1970s. Dr Zoe Davies, chief executive officer of the National Pig Association, said she had huge sympathy for the Princess. ‘The problem is that DEFRA [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] have absolved all responsibility for wild boar to individual landowners. There is no strategy to deal with them and no one knows how many there really are,’ she said. ‘Those who escape into the wild become feral very quickly and breed well. They are incredibly resourceful animals.’ Dr Davies said some pig farmers have complained of wild boar breaking in to breed with their sows and feast on animal feed. ‘They don’t tend to be aggressive unless confronted but sows are protective of their young and if two males get together, which appears may have happened to Princess Anne, then they will fight,’ she added. One of their strongholds is in the Forest of Dean, where a controversial cull recently took place to reduce numbers. Campaign group Friends of the Wild Boar says the cull should not resume because the population of wild boar is much lower than believed. Last night, a Buckingham Palace aide described Anne as being ‘very hands on’ with her farm.","Princess Anne's prized Gloucestershire Old Spot breeding boar has died .

"A video of two sweet-tempered twin girls locking eyes for the first time has surfaced online and it is absolutely precious. The video begins with the two girls, called Paula and Alyssa, laying on their parents' bed on their stomachs, facing each other. Propped up by body pillows, the two appear to recognise the other for the first time, before engaging in a conversation that no one else can understand, occasionally reaching out and grabbing onto each other's hands. Their 30-year-old parents, Paul and Ally, admit that though life with twins can be extremely challenging, it's moments like this that also make it very fun and rewarding. The environment at home is all hands on deck and mum and dad are equally as involved in every aspect of the twins' day. 'It's a two people job,' the couple said in an email. 'They eat at the same time, they go to sleep at the same time. Dad, Paul, captured the heartwarming moment when the two realised they had a little playmate for life . Although life with twins can be difficult, their parents admit that moments like these make it all worth it . 'They copy each other, but they have very different personalities, though both love to laugh and have a great sense of humour.' And they also have similar milestones, since they develop the same - making it that much easier for proud papa Paul to capture this first-time moment on camera. 'It was so awesome to see them realising that they have a little playmate who's just the same as them,' the couple wrote. 'They have similar milestones, since they develop at the same time,' the girls' parents wrote . The two 'lit up' when they looked at each other, which is when dad, Paul, ran for the camera and began filming . 'Every time we would place the babies on their tummies after their meals, we'd see if they would interact and they didn't really,' mum Alyssa added. 'As soon as their dad saw them lock eyes on each other and light up when seeing each other, he knew it was a moment that couldn't have been missed.

"Angry and violent protests against austerity measures continue to flare across Europe, with thousands of students across Italy fighting cutbacks. Thousands of university and high school students clashed with Italian police during a number of marches in major cities, including Rome, Milan and Naples, where the crowds chanted slogans and carried banners such as ‘save schools not banks’. Up to six policemen were wounded in Rome, police said, after students wearing motorcycle helmets and carrying home-made shields pelted them with stones and tried to rush a police van before being driven back in a baton charge. Students wearing motorcycle helmets clash with police in Rome where six officers were injured . A demonstrator lights a flare during one of the protest in Turin, where a number of students were arrested for scuffles . The protests were the latest in a string of strikes and large-scale street protests against prime minister Mario Monti's spending cuts and economic reforms. ‘The protest is to renew the political class, to get rid of those who are corrupt,’ said Giulio Bianco, 18. ‘The politicians make the ordinary people pay. These are heavy sacrifices, and it is a risky policy to keep imposing them,’ the high school student from Rome said. TV pictures from Bologna showed students throwing eggs at a branch of UniCredit bank and trampling on a BNP Paribas flag, while in Palermo protesters burnt copies of political manifestos. Young people have borne the brunt of rising joblessness in Italy, where the youth unemployment rate is 35 per cent, more than three times the overall level. ‘We are worried about our prospects and about the future of our country,’ Madalina Ursu, 19, told Reuters.

Meanwhile hundreds of farmers on tractors tried to invade the country's second-busiest airport in Crete during an anti-austerity protest. Greece has been gripped by a severe financial crisis since late 2009, and waves of spending cuts and tax hikes have led to frequent strikes and demonstrations. The nation's three-month-old coalition government is currently preparing a major new austerity package demanded by rescue creditors. Unions have promised new protests and a general strike next week when the government's new 13.5 billion Euro program is debated in parliament - where the conservative-led coalition controls enough seats to pass the measures.

Police said 106 people were detained for questioning, prompting another protest gathering outside police headquarters and court building today. Misdemeanor charges were filed against the protesting shipyards workers, 94 of which were detained at the scene and subsequently released, while another 12 individuals were sent before an Athens first instance prosecutor.

On the southern island of Crete, hundreds of farmers taking part in an anti-austerity protest yesterday tried to invade the terminal and the runway of Iraklio airport. Police kept them off with tear gas, and one man was detained for trying to drive his tractor onto the runway. Airport authorities said flights were not affected by the protest. Crete is a major tourist destination, attracting more than 44,000 flights last year. Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras said earlier this week that there were still considerable differences between the government and Greece's debt inspectors from the International Monetary Fund, European Commission and European Central Bank over the new austerity package. But he said he hopes to clinch a deal by next week. The country has been in recession since 2008, and the total contraction is projected to reach a cumulative 25 per cent at the end of next year.

"Outraged customers were denied their regular Sunday brunch at the local hotel because the keen cyclists were dressed in lycra. Ross Powell walked into the Raffles hotel in Perth to grab a table ahead of his wife and their two mates, who had all just gone on a morning cycle, when he was approached by a staff member who confronted him with an unexpected remark. 'Sorry mate you can't come in here - we've got a no lycra-free policy - we can't serve you,' the waiter said. Scroll down for video . Ross Powell, along with his wife and two friend,s were denied service at Raffles hotel for wearing lycra . Mr Powell was gobsmacked and told his companions as they walked in that they were not welcome due to their cycling attire. 'I've never been spoke to like that - it was horribly humiliating,' Mr Powell told Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm 43 years old and a father of two kids - I've never been kicked out of anywhere in my life - let alone for the clothes I was wearing.' His wife, Colleen Powell, questioned the waiter when the policy had been put in place and the waiter replied with two weeks ago. 'My wife pointed out that we were served in lycra the week before and then he walked away,' he said. Mr Powell insists the move is blatant discrimination. 'I think most pubs and clubs want young people who are hip and don't like the older crowd as a general rule,' he said. 'People don't like the way we look.' 'It would be considered discrimination if it happened to people with dogs or kids - or customers wearing high visibility clothing.' Hotel management said there was no such policy but a concern for safety where some bikes were parked . Daily Mail Australia approached the hotel for comment but has yet to have heard back. However, Colonial Leisure Group State operations manger Vern Fogarty denied there was a lycra ban to The West Australian saying the concern was residents complaining about some of the parked bikes causing a safety risk. 'It is not our dress standard,' he told the paper. 'We've served cyclists in lycra in the past and we're happy to serve cyclists in lycra in the future.' Mr Fogarty said the incident was a miscommunication which has now been clarified with the staff. But Mr Powell hotel's response was complete nonsense and that the message could not have been misconstrued. 'It's an absolute smokescreen - it's just spin,' he said. 'There was no ambiguity - he was clear about the policy.' Animosity towards cyclists is not a new issue and Mr Powell, who owns the Canning Bridge Cycles shop in Perth, said everybody needed to 'take a chill pill'. 'We all need to get along - the roads are for both cars and bikes,' he said. Mr Powell said he called the hotel on Monday and was told he would be contacted that afternoon following a management meeting about the matter but was yet to hear back.

"Traps have been set up around a lakeside Florida suburb after a family dog was snatched by a gator and pulled into the water this week. Jessie, a 50-pound mixed-breed, had been the pet of Mark Byers for the last 10 years. Mr Byers daughter was walking their dog along the lake at the back of their Sunrise home on Tuesday when suddenly an eight-foot-long alligator came out of the water and grabbed her. 'It's an awful tragedy,' Mr Byers told Local 10 News. 'It's terrible.' Snatched: Jessie was out for a walk along the waters edge in Sunset, Florida, on Tuesday night when she was dragged into the water by a local gator . Missed: Jessie was a beloved part of the Byers family . Predator: The alligator is said to have been in the freshwater lake in Sunset for years, but had been appearing more frequently over the last couple of weeks . Dangerous: Wildlife officers in the area have urged residents to be careful when approaching the water . Dead: Jessie was pulled into the water in a matter of seconds on Tuesday and never seen again . Scene: Mr Byers said he had built a sea wall to try and keep any gators from getting into his yard . Mr Byers said the gator has been lurking in the lake for as long as he can remember. However locals say the reptile has been seen much more frequently over the last two weeks. Mr Byers built a sea wall to stop the animal getting to his dog or his family. However Jessie was playing in the water while out on the walk - something they could never train her to stop doing. That's when the gator suddenly snatched her. 'She’s just gone. Things happen in a split second,' Mr Byers told The Sun Sentinel. 'It’s just a sad situation.'

Ms Barraco warned people who live in the area to be extra cautious, especially if they live around freshwater bodies.

"A 57-year-old man charged with bludgeoning three elderly neighbors to death has been held without bail. Salvatore Guglielmino of North Andover, Massachusetts, allegedly killed Walter Hamilton, 78, George Kettinger Jr., 79, and Frank Kort, 68, at their homes on Tuesday morning with no apparent motive. Authorities say the victims, who lived at a senior housing complex at Foulds Terrace, had blunt force trauma injuries to their faces and no weapon was recovered. Triple-murder charges: Salvatore Guglielmino, 57, of North Andover, Massachusetts, attends his arraignment hearing at Lawrence District Court, Wednesday, January 7 . No apparent motive: He allegedly killed 78-year-old Walter Hamilton, 79-year-old George Kettinger Jr., and 68-year-old Frank Kort at their homes on Tuesday morning . Guglielmino's uncle, Angelo Guglielmino, 81, told the Boston Herald that the family are 'shocked' and 'devastated' by his actions. Other neighbors described the alleged killer as a 'gentle giant' who 'cared' for his aging mother. 'Everybody knew [Salvatore] everybody. He was big. He was nice. And I’m telling you, he loved his mother,' Patricia Bonanno told the Boston Globe. Family members say Guglielmino was taking medications for manic depression and bipolar disorder.

Recovered: The bodies of the victims were found in a unit on Foulds Terrace, which is a public housing complex for the elderly and disabled . Guglielmino apparently had 'no recent history' with the police. The four men he allegedly murdered lived in different units in the same building.

However, defense attorney John Morris says his client denies committing a crime. Guglielmino is due back in court next month. He faces charges for triple-murder and breaking and entering with a maximum sentence being life imprisonment without parole.","Salvatore Guglielmino of North Andover, Massachusetts, allegedly killed 78-year-old Walter Hamilton, 79-year-old George Kettinger Jr., and 68-year-old Frank Kort on Tuesday morning .

"Expat Nigel Jackson, 59, has been arrested by police after his wife Brenda Davidson's body was found buried in their garden in Portugal . A British man has been arrested in Portugal after the body of his wife was found buried under a concrete slab in his idyllic country home. Expat Nigel Jackson, 59, was seized by police after his wife, Brenda Davidson, 73, went missing from their home on the Algarve last November. Portuguese police were alerted by her son, Dean, who had been concerned over the whereabouts of his mother for several weeks. According to neighbours, Jackson had initially said she had returned to the UK 'for treatment for a nasty cough.' But when she failed to return to their home in Alvor near Portimao he then alerted the authorities and told them he was 'dedicated himself to trying to find her.' However her son eventually contacted police and Jackson was arrested at their home and questioned by police for several hours. He then allegedly admitted his wife was dead, led police experts back to his garden and pointed to the spot where his wife was buried. Forensic officers combed the property and then used pneumatic drills and pick axes to break through a concrete slab in the garden. Beneath the thick slab they discovered the decomposing remains of the 73-year-old expat at 8.15pm on Tuesday evening. Experts believe she may have been there for some weeks. Jackson has reportedly admitted to burying his wife but is claiming he did so after the mother-of-four unexpectedly committed suicide at their home. The investigation is being led by Policia Judiciaria officers based in Portimao - the same squad which has been assisting Scotland Yard officers probing the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. He is expected to appear before an investigating magistrate in a closed court hearing when the magistrate will decide whether to release him on bail or remand him in custody. Jackson, seen leaving the couple's home in  Alvor near Portimao, has reportedly admitted to burying his wife but is claiming he did so after the mother-of-four unexpectedly committed suicide . Forensic officers discovered the decomposing remains of the 73-year-old expat under a concrete slab in the couple's garden. Pictured: A policeman stands in front of the house where Ms Davidson was found . In a statement the Policia Judiciaria said: 'The PJ, through the Criminal Investigation Department in Portimao, identified and arrested a man suspected of the murder of his companion. 'The victim had been living with the arrested man for several years in the Portimao area. The suspect is going to be present at a first court hearing to determine the supervision measures against him.' He is expected to appear in court as an arguido or formal suspect. Under Portuguese law he has not yet been formally charged with any crime. The investigation is being led by Policia Judiciaria officers based in Portimao - the same squad which has been assisting Scotland Yard officers probing the disappearance of Madeleine McCann . A post mortem was due to take place last night to try to determine the cause of death and Jackson remains in police custody for questioning. The couple moved to the Algarve around 10 years ago from their home in Rochester, Kent and had built up a close set of friends in the close-knit village. They had apparently got bored of their life in Kent and Mr Jackson, a former taxi driver, and his wife, a retired cleaner, moved to Portugal for a change of scene. Neighbours described them as very close and said Mrs Davidson was a 'very caring and loving' woman who was well-respected in the community.","Nigel Jackson, 59, seized after Brenda Davidson went missing in Algarve .

"Just one year after the Las Vegas mansion of Liberace was purchased for just $500,00 out of foreclosure, the flamboyant pianist's massive estate has been restored to its former glory. British businessman Martyn Ravenhill put in $1million after buying the property in August 2013, and has brought back the opulence and grandeur the massive 14,939-square-foot home was once known for. And he is just getting started. Scroll down for video . British businessman Martyn Ravenhill (above) has spent $1million restoring the Las Vegas mansion of Liberace . Ravenhill purchased the 14,939-square-foot home for $500,000 out of foreclosure in August 2013 . Among the work he has had done is a ceiling mural in the master bedroom and bathroom . 'Liberace, to me, is like the face of Las Vegas. Liberace brought magic to the stage,' said Ravenhill . “I saw that it was for sale and that it was in really bad shape,” Ravenhill told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. 'I called and was told that it already had an offer and was not for sale. I asked ""Who bid on it — a person or a company? Is it officially sold?""' That is when he decided to buy the estate, paying in cash. 'I did not realize the magnitude of the place until I saw it. It is almost 15,000 square feet. In England, you can purchase a studio flat for about $500,000, and here I could get a 15,000-square-foot home owned by Liberace for the same amount,' he said. Now, Liberace's home has come back to life once again. Front door: British businessman Martyn Ravenhill put in $1million after buying the property in August 2013, and has brought back the opulence and grandeur the massive 14,939-square-foot home was once known for .

'Upon entering its ornate doors is the grand staircase that was reportedly imported from France,' says the paper as they describe the interior of the estate. 'The home features 18 chandeliers, some original to the home. There are eight marble pillars and multiple stained-glass windows. Images of Liberace and musical notes are incorporated throughout.' There are also lots of mirrors, and even a ceiling mural in the master bedroom and bath. Aerial: This view shows the huge and sprawling mansion in Las Vegas that the famed and flamboyant pianist and entertainer once called home . 'I grew up believing that Las Vegas is the place of dreams and magic. The house has that glitz and a magical feeling to it,' said Ravenhill .

"Since the emergence of the militant jihadist Islamic State last summer the popularity of the name Isis has had an unsurprising nosedive. The list of things unfortunate enough to share a name with the terrorist group known as ISIS include an Egyptian goddess, a dog on Downton Abbey - and a street in London. However, despite its unfortunate name, Isis Street in Earlsfield, South West London is lined with million-pound properties. How unfortunate! Isis Street used to be associated with an Egyptian goddess, but now, the world knows ISIS as something completely different . Earlsfield, a residential area in the London borough of Wandsworth, is located on the fringes of an area nicknamed Nappy Valley due to its large population of affluent young families. This in combination with the 12-minute train-ride to central London has contributed to property prices skyrocketing in recent years - even on Isis Street. A one-bedroom flat on Isis street sold for £365,000 three years ago, is now estimated to be worth £500,000, according to Zoopla. A two-bedroom maisonette wold for £436,000 in August 2012, is now worth more than £605,000. A house with four bedrooms a bit further down Isis Street was sold for £610,000 in 2007, but is now worth £1.09million. As upper-middle as it gets: Isis Street in Earlsfield is located on the fringes of Nappy Valley in south London . Big money: Despite its unfortunate name, houses on Isis Street sell for up to £1million and a two-bed maisonette will set you back at least £500,000 . You give love a bad name: Since the rise of the Islamic State in June, the word Isis has a bad ring to it . Top quality: Isis Street, located in residential Earlsfield in South London .","Unfortunately named Isis Street is located in south London .

Sarah-Jane Bell, from north Brisbane near Caboolture, started looking for a new travel partner online after she booked a surprise holiday to the Indonesian holiday island with her husband, but he left her by leaving a note on the bed.

Ms Bell said she returned home on September 20 last year to find that her husband (pictured left) had gone . She has received  75 offers with the bid sitting at $50,000 on Thursday morning . Ms Bell said she was only looking to recuperate the $300 name change fee on the ticket when she first posted to ad, offering to sell return flights and accommodation in Kuta for anyone willing to spend nine days with a 'complete stranger'. 'I didn't expect it to go this far,' she told the Today Show. Her eBay stunt has paid off the holiday and given her more than $47,000 in spending money - with the dollar amount expect to climb even higher before the auction ends on Friday morning at 9.48am AEDT. The Virgin Australia return flights Ms Bell booked cost $1264 for two people and the room at luxury Kuta Beach Heritage Hotel cost just over $1200. The newly single 24-year-old clarified that she was not looking to have a steamy getaway - despite the fact she will be sharing a king size bed with her travel partner.

"New Inter Milan manager Roberto Mancini is set to offer Steven Gerrard a move in January, unless the Liverpool captain agrees a new deal at Anfield. Gerrard also has a number of options to move to the United States next summer with New York Cosmos one potential avenue for the 34-year-old midfielder. But the Football Grapevine understands that a move to Serie A could be very appealing. Steven Gerrard (right) is yet to be offered a new deal at Liverpool and could leave Anfield . Roberto Mancini may try to tempt the Liverpool captain to move to Inter Milan . Mancini was unveiled as Inter's new manager at the clubs Como training ground on Saturday . As revealed in the Football Grapevine three weeks ago, Manuel Pellegrini faces the sack from Manchester City at the end of the season. But it is Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone who is top of the short list to replace him at the Etihad, not Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola. My Catalan contacts tell me that Pep would rather manage Manchester United down the line rather than City. Guardiola will see out his contract at Bayern, which runs until the summer of 2016, and, unless there is a dramatic turn of events in Manchester, the Etihad hierarchy will not wait that long.

"A police officer was spotted turning heads on a Sunshine Coast beach for his choice of transport. Contrasting greatly with the bikini-clad beach-goers, Senior Constable Pierre Senekal was seen in a full length uniform, topped off with a helmet, as he rode a Segway across the sand of Noosa beach in Queensland. Senior sergeant Steven Mcreight told Daily Mail Australia that the two-wheeled electric vehicle was often used to patrol beaches and boardwalks in the area. Scroll down for video . Senior Constable Pierre Senekal turned heads while riding a Segway during a beach patrol in Noosa, Queensland . 'It's a quick way to move around and research from other law enforcement agency's show they are relatively quick and have a beneficial height factor of about 15-30 cm that allows better vision,' Mr Mcreight said. 'It's a new technology for new police and the guy enjoys using it and finds it quite convenient.' Mr Senekal said the Segway attracted people's attention whenever he used it, particularly that of tourists. He also told Daily Mail Australia of his own enthusiasm for the device, which he said he rides 'a hundred times a day'. 'It's good fun on the beach, especially when it's busy and you can't really drive or walk - the Segway is pretty good to get around and get between people,' Mr Senekal said. While most sun-bathers waved back at the policeman as he passed by, many more couldn't help but stare admiringly at the officers wheels . 'Tourists love it and lots of people want to take photos, especially as it has police signage and flashing lights.' The Noosa Heads officer said his Segway could drive 18km/h, the pace of a fast jogger, and that although he was yet to chase anyone with it he had been called to jobs with it that had resulted in arrests. Queensland police undertook a trial of the new technology in early 2014 on the Sunshine Coast, Gold Coast and Southbank. The trial, which concluded in June, saw 75 officers trained to use the devices and found that they were an ideal alternative way of transport in areas that are normally only accessible by foot. Segways are already used by police around the world including in China, Paris and New York. The two-wheeled electric vehicle is often used to patrol beaches and boardwalks in Queensland.

"More pressure was piled on Harriet Harman and Patricia Hewitt today after it was revealed they were in contact with a notorious paedophile group after they said it was a spent force. A 1979 letter from a Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) supporter, containing £50 for 'the defence' of three members facing prosecution, is labelled with Ms Harman's initials. The Labour deputy leader has said she 'has never had anything to do' with PIE, and the group was 'marginalised' before she joined the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL) as legal officer in 1978. Her shadow minister husband Jack Dromey maintains that PIE was 'defeated' by him in 1976. Letter: This note from a Paedophile Information Exchange supporter was sent to Harriet Harman after she and others said group was 'marginalised'. It contains a handwritten annotation with 'HH' - Ms Harman's initials - next to it . Denial: : Labour grandees Harriet Harman and her husband Jack Dromey, pictured together last week, say that PIE was defeated by them up to three years before today's letter . But the letter published today arrived three years later, and has a handwritten note next to Harriet Harman's name and says: 'Can we talk about this on Friday? HH'. The letter was from a PIE fan who wanted the NCCL to help defend three members people being prosecuted for 'conspiracy to corrupt public morals' -  charges linked to indecency. The typed note was to Harriet Harman and mentioned three men, including founder Tom O'Carroll, who was later jailed for child sex offences. Its writer said his £50 would 'get the ball rolling' in their defence. 'I got it wrong on PIE and I apologise for having done so': Former Labour cabinet minister Patricia Hewitt has apologised for her links to the paedophile group . In a reply three weeks later, former Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt, then general secretary of the NCCL, wrote back to accept the funds and said her group was 'extremely concerned' and wanted to do 'everything it can to ensure a successful outcome'. Ms Harman's spokesman said last night: 'She has no recollection of any . discussion arising out of this letter but these issues were not her . responsibility and she clearly passed the letter to the then General . Secretary.' Ms Hewitt declined to comment. Jack Dromey's past links to PIE are under continued scrutiny. The shadow policing minister has angrily denied giving succour to the group as a leading light at the National Council for Civil Liberties in the 1970s and 1980s. Mr Dromey claims to have led a fight in 1976 to cast the paedophile group ‘into the darkness’ in 1976. Despite fresh allegations concerning links in years after that he has made no apology, insisting that he always fought against PIE and its aims. But new documents emerged yesterday showing he contributed to a NCCL handbook two years later which promoted contact information for the vile group. Mr Dromey also denies backing an NCCL drive to lower the age of consent to 14. But a 1976 newspaper cutting unearthed from the NCCL’s archives quotes him saying: ‘We anticipated a degree of hysteria when the report was published but we are very happy with the reception.’ Big players: Harriet Harman once legal officer . of the NCCL, now Labour Deputy Leader and husband Jack Dromey, right, a . Left-wing firebrand, now a shadow minister . One Labour figure yesterday said he was ‘stunned’ by the revelations, describing them as ‘really damaging’. Another Labour source said there was disquiet within the party about the continuing emergence of allegations that appeared to undermine Mr Dromey’s unapologetic stance. The NCCL, in which Mr Dromey, Miss Harman and former Labour Cabinet minister Patricia Hewitt were all senior figures, granted the PIE affiliate status for years. Signed: The Labour Deputy Leader's name is carried at the bottom of a briefing that argued that a pornographic picture of a naked child should not be considered indecent unless it could be proven that the subject had suffered . AGM minutes: This page reveals how the PIE was represented at an NCCL AGM at the University of Lancaster. Below the list of organisations present is Jack Dromey's name, after he was re-elected to the executive committee of the NCCL in 1977 . Miss Hewitt last week said the NCCL had been ‘naïve and wrong’ to give support to the paedophile group. Miss Harman has expressed ‘regret’ over the link, but has refused to apologise, saying her work as the NCCL’s legal officer was never influenced by it.","1979 letter from paedophile group supporter contains Ms Harman's initials .

"An Oregon psychic is accused of using her daughter as part of a 'sweetheart swindle' to extort millions of dollars from the ageing heir of a tree farm fortune in an incredible scam that spanned 10 years. Prosecutors allege Rachel Lee, 43, of Oregon, and her daughter, Porsha Lee, 25, created an intricate plot that convinced the elderly victim that Porsha was his wife and that they had together produced a young son named Giorgio Armani. The decade-long scheme allegedly saw the fortune of Ralph Raines Jr., 67 - the sole heir to Raines Tree Farm, which had been in his family for three generations - liquidated of $20 million, leaving him with just $200,000. The mother-daughter team used the proceeds to go on high-flying trips to Las Vegas, buy expensive cars - a convertible Ferrari with 'MRBIG' plates and a 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air convertible - as well as several properties, according to Oregon Live. The intricate conspiracy began in 2004 when Raines traveled from his family's 1,300-acre tree farm in Gaston to Bend for a farming conference. Incredible swindle: Rachel Lee, 43, allegedly spent 10 years scamming an ageing Oregon timber heir, liquidating him of an alleged $20 million, using a plot where her own daughter, Porsha Lee, 25, convinced the man she was his wife . There he met Rachel Lee, who had a local psychic business, and allegedly cottoned on to the wealth that Raines commanded. Lee kept in close touch with Raines and, in 2006, Raines hired her as a caretaker for his father, Ralph Sr., who had suffered a stroke, according to a feature in Willamette Week. Court records claim Lee was soon in charge of the family's finances. Later that year, Raines bought a $915,000 house in Portland, to which Lee's family moved. The scam took a major turn in 2008 when Lee introduced her daughter into her plannings. Porsha Lee - then 17 - put on a blonde wig, heavy makeup and faked a British accent, and was introduced to Raines as a as Mary Marks, a UK resident who needed a green card. Raines told investigators who quickly fell for the woman's charms, especially when she told him she wanted to have a child together. 'Ms Marks' said she wanted to have the child through IVF, convincing Raines to donate his sperm. Stroke: Lees first gained the trust of the family by working as a caretaker for Ralph Raines Sr. (picutred), who suffered a stroke in 2006 . She told him she was going to California to have the baby and later returned with a son, which she told Raines was his. The baby actually belonged to Porsha's sister, Samantha. Somehow, Porsha managed to brainwash Raines into believing they were married. During this time Lee had established joint bank accounts for her daughter and her husband and was allegedly extorting money into accounts of her own. The plot took another turn in 2011 when Ralph Raines Sr. died, with Rachel and Porsha Lee handling his $5 million estate. Rachel Lee went on to convince Raines to sell the family farm for $12.3 million, saying that he needed money for inheritance taxes. As the sale went through, Lee and boyfriend, Blancey Lee, bought themselves luxury cars - a $200,000 Ferrari convertible and a $300,000 Bentley Mulsanne - went on a gambling trip to Vegas, bought properties they used as rentals and opened four psychic shops. Last year, Lee allegedly kept her conspiracy going by convincing Raines he was bankrupt and getting to sell up the remainder the properties in his name. However it all came crashing down when an anonymous source notified police of suspicions they had over what was happening to Raines. The Internal Revenue Service were then pulled into it and started building a case. Federal agents arrested Rachel Lee and Porsha Lee at their psychic shop in Bend in May this year. Prosecutors allege they had swapped their iPhones for disposable cells and had suitcases waiting by the door at the time of the arrest, suggesting they were trying to skip town. Generations-old estate: Raines was the heir to Washington County logging company Raines Tree Farm . Porsha Lee also had about $40,000 cash in her underwear. She is expected to get about three years in prison at her April 15 sentencing after pleading guilty to her charges. She declined comment after Wednesday’s hearing before a federal judge in Portland. Her mother, Rachel Lee, pleaded guilty in the same case last fall and will be sentenced next month. As the mastermind, she is expected to spend seven to nine years in prison. Both were charged with conspiring to commit wire fraud, engaging in monetary transactions in criminally deprived property, and conspiracy to commit transactional money laundering. Wealthy: The company was worth millions of dollars after being built up over the years and was left to Raines . The prosecutor noted that even today, with the guilty pleas, Raines believes he has a wife named Mary Marks and a son. It is unclear whether he suffers from dementia or any other mental health difficulties. However investigators, according to Willamette Weekly, said that Raines tried to stand up for Lees and her daughter when police informed him what had happened. He told them he had given Lees $4 million as a gift. This behavior is said to be common in cases like this, as the victims are often ashamed of family and friends learning what had been done to them.","Rachel Lee, 41, masterminded a plot to liquidate the fortune of Oregon timber heir Ralph Raines Jr., 67, prosecutors say .

"If you've got it, flaunt it. And Labour MP's wife Karen Danczuk certainly isn't afraid of doing exactly that. Just two days ago the councillor, who is known by her army of Twitter followers for her fondness for photos of her ample decolletage, posted her most revealing photo yet, of herself wearing a very skimpy bikini. Yesterday she followed it up with yet more selfies, taken as she agonised over her outfit for an event at the Labour Party conference in Manchester. Scroll down for video . Mrs Danczuk posted this shot on Twitter yesterday, a day after posing for a bikini selfie . She accompanied it with a message that seemed to be seeking affirmation from her 17,000 Twitter fans . In her first picture of yesterday, the councillor from Rochdale, who is married to MP Simon Danczuk, wore a black low cut top with the caption: 'Right folks I've got 2 very exclusive parties to attend tonight. I hope I look ok? KD #happytuesday'. Just eight minutes later she followed it up with another picture of herself, this time wearing red, saying: 'Second thoughts - Let's celebrate #labour and wear Red!!!! Now I feel ready!! KD' A second photo, posted eight minutes later, showed Mrs Danczuk in a red outfit that was barely less revealing . 'Now I feel ready!!' she tweeted - and doubtless her many Twitter followers would agree that she looked it . It follows Monday's picture of her raciest shot to date where she appeared in a skimpy bikini top, showing off her cleavage, alongside the message: 'How chuffed do I look? I've faced my fear & swam in the sea for the first time in my life! It was fab. I'm made up. KD'. Mrs Danczuk has gained more than 17,000 followers after posting more than 50 pictures of herself on the site. But now it seems her fame is spreading worldwide with one Spanish website speculating that she could be a new international star. The Spanish website Enlace Virtual featured Monday's bikini shot alongside an article that concluded: 'Let's wait to see if we are witnessing the birth of a new star.' Since gaining fame through her selfies the 31-year-old has also sparked rumours that she could soon be featuring on the nation's television screens, having revealed she has been in talks with Channel 4. Mrs Danczuk, who posted a revealing bikini selfie on Twitter earlier in the week, left, has posted more than 50 racy shots online . Mrs Danczuk wrote: 'I've got dinner with the big bosses from Channel 4 later. Killer heels or sensible heels?? That is the question!! KD' But critics have attacked Mrs Danczuk for her pictures but she has continued to address criticism posting: 'I agree there are gender equality issues, but to suggest a woman can't embrace her sexuality just in case is madness. Its me & my curves! KD'. Earlier this year Mrs Danczuk, who says she has been urged by friends to run for parliament, was embroiled in a furious online Twitter spat with the former Tory MP Louise Mensch over pictures of her cleavage.

"January is a month of reflection - and decisions. If your relationship finished in a decidedly messy state over Christmas, the start of a New Year offers just the incentive you need to sort things out. Stopping that affair, for instance. Scroll down for video . Tracey says that having an affair doesn't mean you're a monster, and there are plenty of reasons to stray . Mira Kirshenbaum, one of my favourite US relationship experts, is the author of When Good People Have Affairs. It's one of few books written for people who are involved in affairs and don't know what to do and that doesn't beat them about the head with a stick. Mira identifies 17 different types of affairs in the book - which have inspired some of the reasons below. Others are my own observations or based on other current research. If you're having an affair and need to make some tough decisions this year, this should help clarify your motives and offer practical advice on what to do next. Many of us have affairs to make up for something our relationship is lacking, this doesn't have to be sex . The reasons why most people have affairs: . 1. TO REVIVE YOUR SEX LIFE . This affair's not about being madly besotted with someone else, it's done as a last bid attempt to wake up your partner sexually and romantically. They find out, they're upset, devastated… but suddenly they appreciate you, sex is hot again. If this is you: Most of these affairs die a natural death and some do achieve the desired result: the marriage can actually get better. Of course in other cases, the attempt to heat things up ends up causing a fire that destroys the lot. 2. TO SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING BETTER OUT THERE . Comparison affairs are the most common female affair. You're doing it because certain emotional and sexual needs aren't being met in your marriage. You compare your new lover to your husband to see if you're missing out. If this is you: You did this for a reason, now make a decision. If you're happier with the new person, leave. If you're not, finish it and put your energy back into your marriage. 3. TO FORCE YOU TO LEAVE . Tracey offers practical advice on whether now is the right time to leave your partner . If you'd secretly be relieved if your partner found out, you're having an 'exit affair'. If this is you: Leave - and don't pretend to yourself or your lover that you're leaving for them, you're not. 4. TO 'SUPPORT' THE MARRIAGE . You're happy with your marriage but bored or sexually unfulfilled: you have no desire to leave but need the excitement an affair provides. Another circumstance: there's some reason your partner can't have sex (like illness) or you don't want to leave the marriage because of children or finances. These are called 'stabilising' affairs or 'three-legged stools' as with just two legs a stool would fall over, with three it's stable. If this is you: This actually works for lots of people. But there's a huge risk involved because the longer an affair lasts, the more likely you are to get found out. Sometimes, particularly if the marriage has become more of a friendship, the affair is an unspoken agreement between couples. 5. FOR REVENGE . It could be payback for an affair they had, or they're not paying you enough attention. If this is you: If it's your only motive, you've achieved your aim. Stop it now – and don't even think about telling your partner, no matter how sweet that revenge might be. 6. YOU'RE HAVING A MIDLIFE CRISIS . Do I need to say more? If this is you: Skip the affair and talk with a friend, your partner or a counsellor about your fears of dreams slipping away, ageing or death – whatever it is you're preoccupied with. 7. TO AVOID FACING THE TRUTH . You know you should either leave or face your problems but instead you have a fling to distract yourself. If this is you: Make a choice to leave or stay and work at it. You're hurting everyone more by lingering in no-man's land. 8. TO REWARD YOURSELF . You've been a great husband/wife, mum/dad, you deserve it. Lots of people indulge this one by having a 'safe' one night encounter where the chances are getting found out are minimal. Trouble is, it turns into two nights, then three, then... If this is you: You've had your 'treat', now stop it. 9. YOUR PARTNER'S NOT MEETING A CERTAIN NEED . It might be sex you're lacking or it might be affection, feeling taken for granted. If this is you: Once you get the need met by a lover, you'll know just how important it is to you. If it wasn't that crucial, stop the affair. If it was ask your spouse to satisfy it. If they won't or can't, then leave. Tracey says that if you fancy trading your partner in for a younger model you may what to rethink . 10. TO SATISFY AN EXPERIENCE YOUR PARTNER CAN'T . You've never had a threesome/have a fetish or quirk you'd like to act out but know your partner would be horrified. It seems safer to try it outside the marriage. If this is you: Sometimes doing it once gets it out the way. Other times, it reveals just how important it is. Are you sure your partner can't provide what you crave? If you intend to leave unless they do, you've got nothing to lose by asking. 11. TO BOOST YOUR EGO . You want to see if you can still pull. If this is you: If you don't get found out and it's a relatively short affair, the confidence boost can actually renew the relationship. That's Mira's take on it. I say it's a bloody risky way to boost your ego. Wouldn't a new haircut and slinky dress do the job? 12. YOU WANT TO TRADE UP . You see it all the time when people become famous: the dutiful partner who helped them get there is rather rudely shoved aside for a sparkly young pert model. If this is you: They might be 'better' in society's eyes but plenty of people miss the 'old model' more than they expect they would.

"Karen Danczuk has come under fire numerous times over the last year for her sexy selfies, which often display her ample cleavage. And the Rochdale councillor clearly isn't changing her ways for 2015, sharing two pictures direct from her beach holiday in Spain.

The snaps, which show off the 31-year-old brunette’s generous cleavage, were taken on the beach in Spain, where she has been escaping the cold British winter. Alongside one of the pictures, Cllr Danczuk wrote: 'OK so I couldn’t come to my favourite beach without taking a selfie!!' In another tweet, the Rochdale politician said: 'When negativity is upon us***it’s always best to smile.' Cllr Danczuk also commented on the silhouette of her phone was showing up on her chest, writing: 'The sun is shining so there’s still a little shadow!'

"He may have got a standing ovation inside, but Bill Cosby was ridiculed leaving his first show November on Wednesday night, as scores of protesters braved below-freezing conditions to shame the besieged comedian. Cosby's show in Kitchener was the first of three performances planned in Canada's Ontario province and came in the wake of sexual assault allegations from more than 15 women. As he was leaving the Centre In The Square Theatre following the performance - for which seated fans got to their feet to applause -  a heckler approached Cosby, who was well-guarded by security and other entourage members. 'Congratulations on your first show of 2015. Talk about starting the year with a bang! We hope it was consensual, Billy!,' the man can be heard shouting out in a video captured by NBC. Shamed: A heckler screamed out as Bill Cosby left his first performance in two months at the Centre In The Square Theatre in Kitchener, Canada, after at least 10 shows were canceled in the wake of his sex scandal . Exit strategy: Cosby was surrounded by security as he made his way to a car outside, not far from where dozens of protesters with placards were boycotting his show . Out in force: :  Protesters gather outside Bill Cosby show on Wednesday night in Kitchener, Canada . Boycott: A woman heckles fans going into a Bill Cosby show at the Centre In The Square venue . Taking to the stage: Cosby was performing his first show since November, after a spate of rape allegations were leveled against him . The entertainer saw at least 10 performances get canceled on his North American tour. Wearing a sweater saying 'hello friend,' Cosby climbed the stage decorated with two giant posters of himself with Nelson Mandela. Some in the audience gave loud whoops but the reception was subdued compared to the standing ovation at his last stage performance in Florida. 'First of all thank you,' Cosby said to the audience before starting his routine with some cold weather jokes. There were no disruptions during the performance and the crowd laughed throughout. 'I had a wonderful time,' Cosby said before leaving to a standing ovation. However some ticket-holders had said they would boycott the performance, and the 2,000-seat venue was about two-thirds full. Several police officers and private security guards were posted throughout. Outside the Centre in the Square, more than a dozen protesters came out in sub-freezing temperatures, carrying signs saying 'rape is no joke.' Some shouted 'you support rape' and 'shame on you' at fans. On with the show: Cosby speaks with the crowd spoke to a crowd at Center In The Square in Kitchener .

People protest at the Centre In The Square venue where Bill Cosby performed Wednesday . A few protesters blocked the doors of the venue until being asked to leave by security. But fans defended Cosby as they arrived. 'I'm skeptical of all the accusations,' said Gerald Reinink. 'I always loved Cosby, good family humor. Why are 20 women coming out now when it's 20, 30 years ago?' Dan Emerson said he was glad there were no hecklers inside the venue. 'Innocent until proven guilty. I'm hope it's not true and until I know otherwise I love him to death,' Emerson said. Cosby, 77, is also scheduled to appear at the Budweiser Gardens in London on Thursday and at the Hamilton Place Theatre in Hamilton on Friday. The comedian, who starred as Dr. Cliff Huxtable on 'The Cosby Show' from 1984 to 1992, earning a reputation as 'America's Dad,' has never been charged in connection with any of the sexual assault allegations. Bill Cosby performs his standup show live at the Centre In The Square Theatre in Kitchener . A woman in a wheelchair braves freezing temperatures to protest Cosby's performance . A 2005 lawsuit by a Pennsylvania woman was settled before it went to trial, and he is being sued by a woman who claims he molested her in 1974 and by three other women who allege they were defamed by the comedian when his representatives denied some of the allegations. Most of the women say he drugged them before he assaulted them. Hours before Cosby took the stage, attorney Gloria Allred said three more women are accusing the comedian of drugging and sexually assaulting them in Las Vegas or Los Angeles between 1981 and 1996. Allred said at a news conference in Los Angeles that the accusations are too old for criminal charges or lawsuits. Phylicia Rashad, who played Cliff Huxtable's wife Claire on the Cosby Show, defended her co-star in an interview Wednesday with ABC World News Tonight. Rashad said she believed the allegations are part of a campaign to ruin Cosby's legacy. 'He's a genius. He is generous, he's kind, he's inclusive,' said Rashad, who first spoke to Roger Friedman earlier this week for his Showbiz911 blog. 'This is not about the women. This is about something else. This is about the obliteration of legacy.'","Cosby performed his first of three shows in Canada on Wednesday night .

"A mother who was so fat that struggled to climb the stairs to her flat, lost ten stone after realising she would have to diet or move house. Weighing 19st 6lbs and wearing size 24 clothes, Charlotte Cassar, 30, from Southampton was left breathless and sweating every time she tackled the three flights of stairs to her two-bedroom maisonette. With three young children and a pushchair, it felt like climbing a mountain several times a day to morbidly obese Charlotte. Scroll down for video . Charlotte Cassar, 20, from Southampton, weighed 19st 6lbs (left) after having a third child and lost her breath each time she took the stairs to her flat. She decided it was crunch time - move house or diet and then lost ten stone in under a year (right) Charlotte was faced with either moving or losing the weight. But after losing lost ten stone and going from a size 24 to a size eight she can handle the stairs with ease. In fact, instead of dreading them, they have now become part of her new healthy workout regime. Charlotte who is 5ft 8ins tall said: ‘At my size, the stairs were the blight of my life. Sometimes I wouldn’t even bother going out because I was so heavy that I was already tired out just getting to the bottom, never mind climbing back up. ‘I hated them and started looking at other properties to move into just because I was too fat to cope with them.' Charlotte at the top of the stairs to her flat - now she has lost ten stone, she incorporates them into her exercise regime . She continued: ‘It was hard enough when I had two children, but when my youngest son was born and I had to try and carry a baby and a buggy as well as all my fat, I knew I could not continue. 'It was diet or move. ‘Now I run up and down them in seconds, it’s great.’ Charlotte admits that she used pregnancy as an excuse to eat whatever she wanted without feeling guilty . Charlotte admits the stairs were already a battle for her and her two older sons Bradley, 11 and Riley, six, but it was falling pregnant with Finley, now one, that was the tipping point. She said: ‘I’ve always been a bigger girl, even at school I was a size 16, but with each pregnancy I’ve gained more and more weight and with Finley, I put on more than five stone.’ Charlotte admits that she used the pregnancy as an excuse to eat whatever she wanted without feeling guilty. She said: ‘I think a lot of women will identify with that feeling. It’s the one time you don’t have to feel bad about it.' So on top of carb-heavy meals she regularly snacked on extra toast, sandwiches and crisps. She said: ‘Savoury food has always been my downfall. I could take or leave sweets and chocolate but not crisps and sandwiches.’ But it still came as a surprise to learn that after Finely was born in December 2013, she weighed 19 stone 6lbs. Charlotte said: ‘ I was mortified. It was the heaviest I had ever been in my life and I felt awful for allowing myself to get so fat. 'I used to tell myself that because I was tall I could carry the weight but I was clearly very unhealthy not to be able to climb the stairs without sweating and panting.’ She also suffered back pains and anxiety, both caused by her weight. But it was trying to navigate the dreaded stairs with her newborn and pushchair that was the final straw. She said: ‘To me it was like climbing Everest even before I’d started the school run. ‘I’d get to the bottom a sweaty out of breath mess, I felt embarrassed and ashamed that it had come to that.’ As well as struggling to reach her own home, Charlotte claims her weight also impacted on the way she parented her sons. Charlotte with her youngest child Finn, who was born in December 2013, she weighed 19st 6lbs . She said: 'My older sons would want me to play dance games with them on their Wii but I couldn’t even finish one song. ‘If they wanted to go to the park, my heart sank because I just wasn’t fit enough to keep up with them.’ So 12 weeks after giving birth in March 2014, she signed up to the Cambridge Weight Loss Plan. She swapped all food for meal replacement products from a range of shakes, cars and soups. She said: ‘ The Cambridge Plan just took all food out of the equation for me, which is what I needed. ‘I thought I would be starving considering the amount I had been eating, but I actually felt better and less sluggish.' Charlotte went from a size 24 to a size 8 in under a year . In the first week she lost ten pounds and then continued to lose around three or four pounds a month until she reached her target of 10 stone 10 pounds in just seven months and a dress size 12. She used the dreaded stairs as part of her exercise routine and found they became easier to tackle as the weeks passed. But Miss Cassar was so thrilled with the results of her diet physically and emotionally that she continued on the plan until she reached a size eight weighing 9 stone 10 pounds in December last year. She said: ‘I cannot tell you how much easier my life became after losing the weight. Not just because I could handle the stairs so well, but also what I could do with my sons. ‘When my eldest told me he was proud of me I was over the moon because they are the reason I did it. ‘However my middle son is a little annoyed that I am not as comfortable to snuggle up to now all my padding has gone.’ Charlotte after her weight loss with her youngest son Finn . Charlotte's only regret is not losing the weight earlier. She said: ‘ I have never been a size eight in my life and it feels amazing. I’m just gutted I missed out for so long and there is no way I will ever let myself go like that again. ‘I don’t just look better, I feel a million times better.’ A move is still on the cards, but only because she would prefer her son’s to live in a home with a garden. ‘I’m looking for a house that suits as better, but now it’s because that’s what our family needs, not because I’m too fat to climb the stairs.’","Charlotte Cassar was breathless each time she took the stairs to her flat .

"Four huge castles in Scotland are among the palatial properties north of the border which would not be hit by the mansion tax - while a two-bedroom flat in central London would be, it emerged today. The row over Labour's planned levy has intensified in recent days after the party's new Scottish leader Jim Murphy boasted that he would boost the NHS in Scotland by using up to £250million raised from the controversial tax in England. Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls has suggested a £2million threshold would be placed on the tax, with the owners of properties priced above that value taking a hit. But low property prices in Scotland mean even the owners of the 17-bedroom baronial Orchardton Hall mansion house in Dumfries and Galloway - which is currently on the market for £1.4million - would get out of paying the charge. Ethie Castle in Angus dates from the 14th century and has eight reception rooms and nine bedrooms - but its £1.65million price tag means it would be unaffected by Labour's planned mansion tax, which it has been suggested would only affect properties over a £2million threshold . Lickleyhead Castle near Aberdeen has seven bedrooms and a separate 'gardeners cottage' in its sprawling grounds. But at £1.35million, its owners would also not have to pay the planned charge . According to estate agents, Lickleyhead is 'a fine example of a late 15th century four-storey towerhouse, with a stone circular stairway' Similarly, the nine-bedroom, eight-reception room £1.65million Elsie Castle in Angus, which comes with an outdoor swimming pool, tennis court and walled garden, would also avoid the tax. The sprawling £1.65million Arbigland House mansion in Kirkbean near Dumfries, which boasts, according to estate agents, 'unprecedented views over the sea and surrounding countryside' and the turreted £1.35million Lickleyhead Castle near Aberdeen would also not incur the levy. However, in London - where critics of the tax have pointed out that even owners of modest homes would face the charge - some small flats are priced above the £2million threshold. A two-bedroom, fifth-floor flat in Princes Court apartment block, Knightsbridge is currently on the market for £2.1million, meaning its eventual owners will have to pay if the tax if it is brought in. The discrepancy is one of the reasons why some of London's Labour MPs have hit out at Mr Murphy's claims of extra money for Scotland. Arbigland House, Kirkbean, near Dumfries, is a Georgian house with a cobbled courtyard and a famous coastal garden. It is one of the 'palatial' mansions whose relatively low price compared to properties in south east England mean they would be exempt from the mansion tax . Seller says Arbigland has 'a classical Georgian entrance with good decorative stone detail' and 'beautifully proportioned'  reception rooms . Similarly Orchardton House, a baronial mansion overlooking the Solway Firth. Despite having seventeen bedrooms, it is valued at £1.4million . Estate agents say Orchardton Hall is 'a fine example of a mansion house built in the Scots Baronial style popular in the Victorian era' Former Labour leadership candidate Diane Abbott accused Mr Murphy of trying to ‘buy Scottish votes with money expropriated from London’. And former Labour Cabinet minister Tessa Jowell warned him against treating the South East as a ‘cash cow’. Tottenham MP David Lammy added his voice to the Labour dissenters today when he told the Evening Standard: 'Why should the landed gentry in Scotland, or someone with a place as large as Downton Abbey, get away scot-free?' Labour’s new mansion tax will levy an annual charge on all properties valued at more than £2million. Full details have yet to be announced, but Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said last year that homes worth between £2million and £3million will face an annual bill of £3,000, regardless of income. Critics warn that the tax will disproportionately hit London and the South East, where many ordinary family homes will be caught by the plans. Fewer than 900 homes in Scotland would be affected – 0.3 per cent of the UK total. Meanwhile in London, a fifth-floor, two-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge's Prince Court has been valued at £2.1million, making it eligible .","Cheap property prices in Scotland mean even sprawling mansions would not be hit by Labour's planned charge .

"A make-up artist fears a mystery illness which has caused her to double in size in just six months will soon leave her unable to move. Laura Pell, 34, weighed 9st (126lb/57kg) last summer and kept herself in shape by going to gym three times a week and eating a sensible diet. But after being struck down with a mystery illness which has baffled doctors, she began to retain fluid which has caused her body to swell in size. She now weighs 17 stone (238lb/108kg) and describes her life as 'hell'. On average, she is gaining an average of one-a-half-stone every month and has gone from a slender size 10 to size 22. Scroll down to video . Laura Pell, 34, weighed 9st last summer (left) but has ballooned in size due to a mystery illness . Fluid retention has caused the 34-year-old to nearly double in size - from a size 8 to 22 - in just six months . Miss Pell, who lives  in Kingsthorpe, Northamptonshire, has also been forced to buy a completely new set of clothes. She has also been forced to give up her job as a wedding make-up artist because she struggles to walk and fears she she will soon be unable to move if a cure is not found. She said: 'I am in absolute agony and I am struggling to move. The last six months have been hell, and I just have no quality of life. 'When you're fat you're supposed to be flabby and wobbly, but my skin is just completely taut and tight. 'I know that some people who look at me in the street must be thinking I've just let myself go and eat too much, but I actually less than I did before I had this condition. 'I joke to my boyfriend Mark that I'm like Violet from Willy Wonka when she turns into a blueberry - I need to be sent to the juicing room. 'I'm a bit like a human waterbed, I'm just so full of liquid, you can see it in my skin.' On average, she is gaining an average of one-a-half-stone every month and says her confidence is shattered . Miss Pell has also been forced to give up her job as a wedding make-up artist because she struggles to walk. She fears she she will soon be unable to walk if a cure is not found for the fluid retention . The mysterious health problem has led to  rapid fluid retention, high blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat. Despite several weeks of hospital treatment and taking medication to ease the fluid retention, Miss Pell’s condition has not improved, the Northampton Chronicle reports. After exhausting all treatment routes available on the NHS, she is now raising money for a private medical appointment to see a specialist who may be able to diagnose the cause of the problem. Miss Pell's new appearance has also severely damaged her confidence. As a result, she barely leaves the house and also finds travelling painful. 'My heart rate goes up to about 180 beats per minute whenever I try to do any form of exercise,' she said. Miss Pell, who does not have any children, has suffered from Primary Immune Deficiency for years and needs regular injections to replenish plasma levels in her blood. The condition has caused her to suffered from a number of health problems, including meningitis, tuberculosis, pneumonia and Clostridium Difficile. Last August, doctors discovered a benign tumour on her pituitary gland but this was dismissed as a cause to her rapid fluid retention. She was prescribed powerful diuretics and steroids in an attempt to drain the excess fluid from her body but all treatments have so far failed. She is now planning to see an neurologist and an endocrinologist at a private clinic in Manchester in a desperate bid to find a cure. 'I have had so many doctors tell me I am a ""complicated case"", but I know that already. 'I want someone who knows how to sort this out. 'My boyfriend and my mum are basically my carers now. I'm 34 years old, but I feel like I'm 90. 'I don't fit into any of my old clothes and it's costing a fortune to buy new ones.' She said: 'I'm a bit like a human waterbed, I'm just so full of liquid, you can see it in my skin' Doctors are baffled as to why she is retaining so much fluid, describing her as a 'complicated case' 'I have two Jack Russell dogs called Sam and Millie and they are often the only thing that gets me out of bed in the morning, but I can't even walk them so Mark has to do that. 'I have been with Mark about 18 months but he has stuck by me through all this. I am very lucky he is with me because he loves me, not for how I look. 'When I catch a glimpse of myself in the reflection of a window or mirror I don't recognise myself.' Her friends have also rallied round and set up a Facebook group called 'Laura Needs Our Help' which already has hundreds of supporters from around the world. Miss Pell said: 'I'm used to being ill because of my immune problems, but this has been so tough.' 'It was really embarrassing the last time I went for an MRI scan because the machine is quite small and they were afraid that if I went in I would get stuck. 'I had to have an alternative CT scan instead. 'No one seems to have any idea what is causing this and I'm genuinely scared I'll soon end up too large to walk.'","Make-up artist Laura Pell, 34,  was a size 8 and weighed 9st last summer .

"It’s already been proven that cooing at a newborn baby is a vital part of teaching them to speak. Now, scientists claim that talking to babies gives them advantages in life far beyond a larger vocabulary. They say that chatting to babies under the age of one, helps them make friends, as well as making them brighter because they are better able to discover the world around them. Scientists claim that talking to babies (illustrated with a stock image) gives them advantages in life far beyond a larger vocabulary. They say that chattering to babies under the age of one, helps them make social connections, as well as improving their cognitive ability . In recent years, there have been many studies about the ‘word gap’ – the idea that parents in impoverished homes speak less to their children, leading to their kids not achieving as much as they might at school and earning less in later life. But Sandra Waxman, a psychologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, said: ‘It's not because [children] have low vocabularies that they fail to achieve later on. That's far too simple.’ ‘The vocabulary of a child - raised in poverty or in plenty - is really an index of the larger context in which language participates.’ In a study published in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences, she and Athena Vouloumanos of New York University advocate talking to babies. Dr Vouloumanos believes this is important not only because it teaches them more words, but because ‘listening to speech promotes the babies' acquisition of the fundamental cognitive and social psychological capacities that form the foundation for subsequent learning.’ The researchers say that babies who have been exposed to more human speech are better than their peers are listening to interesting sound, which allow them to pick people with whom they can communicate, as well as more easily absorb information about the world around them. Professor Waxman told MailOnline that babies who are 'clued in' to language are better able to absorb information about objects and events in the world around them (illustrated with a stock image) Professor Waxman told MailOnline: 'Because they [babies] are so ""clued in"" to language, when they are listening to language, their attention to objects and events in the world is heightened. 'This heightened focus, or attention, promotes rapid learning and discovery.' She continued: ‘These new results…tell us that infants as young as 2 or 3 months of age not only love to listen to speech, but that they learn about fundamental cognitive and social relations better in the context of listening to speech than in any other context we've discovered yet. 'Nobody would have thought that,’ ‘This early tuned sensitivity to human language has positive, cascading developmental consequences that go way beyond learning language.' Irish researchers who conducted a study on the impact of bedtime reading on 7,845 nine-month-old infants, found that absent-minded conversation was four times better at improving a child's communication skills than reading to them or showing them pictures. In the study, 94 per cent of infants had a parent show them pictures; 80 per cent of nine-month-olds were read to and 66 per cent of mothers reported always talking to their children.

Researchers at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) found that as well as communication skills, chatting to children was three times better at improving problem solving skills. Suzanne Egan, a lecturer in psychology at University of Limerick's Mary Immaculate College, told Eithne Shortall at the Sunday Times that she was surprised by the results. 'We would have thought that there might have been a good effect of reading, perhaps more so than the talking,' she said. She said that it's easier for many parents to talk to their children regularly than devote all their attention and time to reading a book.","Psychologists at Northwestern University, Illinois and New York University say it's not just poor vocabularies that prevent children from achieving .

"The funeral of a five-year-old girl who died after being knocked down by a car days before Christmas has been postponed because her grandparents have been denied a visa. Andrea Gada was hit by a car in Eastbourne in East Sussex as she walked home from school with her father and stepped out into the road. But despite the efforts of locals to raise £5,000 to support her parents and pay for family members to fly over from Zimbabwe for the funeral, officials have now denied to grant a visa for the child's grandparents Charity and Wellington Gada. The funeral of five-year-old Andrea Gada, who was killed in a road accident, has been postponed after her grandparents and aunt were denied a visa to travel to the UK from Zimbabwe to come and pay their respects . Stephen Lloyd, MP for Eastbourne, has accused the Home Office of 'callousness.' Officials have also denied a visa to Andrea's aunt who wanted to come across to England to pay her final respects to the child. Andrea was struck by a Ford Fusion in Friday Street at about 3.15pm on December 16 and was flown to St George's Hospital in Tooting in South London for treatment, but died of her injuries. Her parents believe she may have stepped into the road because she was eager to get home and wrap Christmas presents for her friends. Andrea was struck by a car as she walked home . The 64-year-old female driver from Eastbourne was not injured in the incident, Sussex Police said. Since her death locals in Eastbourne have supported the child's parents, both students, and raised money to help family members travel over for her funeral. Mr Lloyd said: 'This awful accident has shocked us all. 'Eastbourne has done what it does best in difficult situations like this and rallied around in support as a community. 'I was dismayed therefore to discover that the Immigration Services have refused point blank to issue visas for the family to come over from Zimbabwe to attend little Andrea's funeral. 'This is despite Mr and Mrs Gada giving me a categorical assurance the grandparents and aunt would be returning home soon after paying their respects. 'I am extremely angry at the callousness shown by the Home Office. 'To me this is an immigration decision which lacks compassion and basic decency - attributes which I know are front and centre with the vast majority of British people. 'I have written a further urgent letter to the Immigration Minister, James Brokenshire MP, asking that he intervene and reconsider his officials' decision. 'A young girl has died tragically. Mr Lloyd said he wanted to appeal to Mr Brokenshire to grant temporary travel visas to the family so they could pay their respects to the young girl. Wellington and Charity Gada are from Zimbabwe and were granted asylum in the UK.

"It could be a really cool way to lose weight. Research suggests that winter weather may help keep us thin. In what will be welcome news for those who ate a few too many mince pies, it seems that something as simple as standing outside without a coat on could help rolls of fat melt away. Lost the coat! Something as simple as standing outside without a coat on could help rolls of fat melt away . The troublesome white variety that we are all too familiar with soaks up extra calories and stores them in big bellies, love handles and saddlebag thighs. But adults also have a small amount of a second ‘healthy fat’. This brown fat specialises in burning off calories and generates heat as it does so. Babies have the lots of brown fat to keep them warm and adults that have more brown fat are slimmer than those without. A spokesman for the Californian researchers said: ‘Those who over-indulged during the holidays may want to get a shot of cold air to kick-start some extra fat-burning activity for the new year.’ The theory isn’t to do with low temperatures speeding up metabolism, instead it hinges on the different properties of two types of body fat. The troublesome white variety that we are all too familiar with soaks up extra calories and stores them in big bellies, love handles and saddlebag thighs. But adults also have a small amount of a second ‘healthy fat’. This brown fat specialises in burning off calories and generates heat as it does so. Babies have the lots of brown fat to keep them warm and adults that have more brown fat are slimmer than those without. The University of California, Berkley researchers, showed protein called Zfp516 to be key in turning ‘bad’ white fat into a fat that resembles the healthy brown stuff. With around 90 per cent of the fat in an adult’s body of the unhealthy white variety, finding a way of browning it could have a big impact. Importantly, cold temperatures ramp up production of the browning protein. And the more Zfp516 there, is the more white fat is converted into calorie-burning brown fat. In one experiment, mice that were genetically engineered to make large amounts of Zfp516 put on 30 per cent less weight than other creatures – despite feasting on fatty food. It is thought that while babies still need brown fat to keep them warm, the amount of brown fat in adults may have dropped in tandem with our cosy, centrally-heated modern lives. The researchers said: ‘It has been noted that outdoor workers in northern Finland who are exposed to cold temperatures have a significant amount of brown fat when compared to same-aged indoor workers but overall the per centage of brown fats in adults is small compared to white fat.’ Mice with high levels of the browning protein also found it easier to process sugar – something that should cut their odds of diabetes, the journal Cell Metabolism reports. Babies have lots of 'good' brown fat to keep them warm and adults that have more brown fat are slimmer than those without . Researcher Jon Dempersmier said: ‘Brown fat is active, using up calories to keep the body warm. It will burn fat, it will burn glucose. ‘The idea is that if we can harness this, we can try to use this in therapy for weight loss and diabetes.’ The research backs up the Ice Diet, a slimming plan that includes advice such as starting each day with a glass of cold water, sleeping in a cool room and ending a shower with a bracing blast cold water. In future, it may be possible increase levels of the browning protein – and so brown fat - without the need to endure the cold. Lead scientist Hei Sook Sul said: ‘If you can somehow increase levels of this protein through drugs, you could have more brown fat and could possibly lose more weight even if eating the same amount of food.’ Others say that low temperatures will only help us lose weight if we don’t compensate for the calories burnt off by the new brown fat. Lacking calories and miserable in the cold, it may be all too easy to reach for a bar of chocolate.","Experiment hinged on the different properties of two types of body fat .

"Joanne Mjadzelics, 39, is on trial at Cardiff Crown Court accused of possessing and distributing indecent images of children . The ex-girlfriend of paedophile Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins has denied that she carried out a campaign to expose him out of jealousy over his affairs with other women. Joanne Mjadzelics, 39, is on trial at Cardiff Crown Court accused of possessing and distributing indecent images of children and encouraging Watkins to send her images. The mother-of-one said she wanted to get 'inside' Watkins's head by taking part in graphic online sex chat, which also included references to the abuse of babies, as a way of trapping him. She insisted she had a 'legitimate reason' for the possession of indecent images of children as it was part of a plan to bring the musician - jailed for 35 years for trying to rape a baby - to justice. Mjadzelics from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, denied all charges and claimed her campaign to expose him as a child abuser was motivated by protecting victims and not out of spite. Police found a computer file titled 'Jo Filth' on which the pair discussed online incest while acting out being brother and sister and cross-dressing. They also talked about kidnapping a brother and sister from outside a school, killing one and raping the other. Mjadzelics told the jury: 'Playing him, leading him on, telling him what he wanted to hear, telling him that I loved him, although I don't think I did, just telling him what he wanted to hear. 'Dirty talk, filthy talk, describing horrible things... just to play along.' Michael Wolkind QC, defending, asked her whether she was driven by jealousy because Watkins had a string of lovers. 'No, I was concerned he was molesting a child,' she said. Earlier, Mjadzelics told the court she could not remember the indecent photographs she is accused of sending to Watkins, or searching for them. 'I'd remember if I'd done it but I haven't done that,' she said. The jury has previously heard that Mjadzelics - a former prostitute and special constable - first reported Watkins to the authorities in 2008 and claimed the police would not listen to her concerns. She said police branded her a 'nut job' who was 'harassing' the musician and his family. Cardiff Crown Court heard how mother-of-one Mjadzelics raised concerns with police and social services about Watkins' (pictured) child sex crimes four years before he was finally convicted of a series of offences . Mjadzelics told the Cardiff Crown Court (pictured) she had a 'legitimate reason' for the possession of indecent images of children as it was part of a plan to bring the musician to justice . The 39-year-old told Cardiff Crown Court that she told police and social services about Watkins' child sex crimes in 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012. Mjadzelics told the court she reported him to Pontypridd Child Services and the police child protection unit in December 2008 and gave a statement to a 'woman police constable' at West Yorkshire Police and to officers at South Wales Police in early 2009. She said she also wrote letters to Watkins' mother warning her of her son's paedophile activities only to be questioned by police in March 2009 over 'harassment' of his family. She said she broke contact with Watkins in 2009. Ian Watkins was jailed for 35 years in December 2013 after being convicted of a number of horrific sex crimes including the attempted rape of a baby . But she told the court they met again in a Leeds hotel in 2010 where he opened his laptop and showed her a video of a 'child crying and being raped' while Watkins had an 'evil smirk' on his face. Mjadzelics said: 'He was looking at me for a reaction and I cried and told him to get out of the hotel room.' She told jurors that she tried repeatedly to report the crime to police but she was 'ignored'. It was then, she claims, that she decided she needed to 'trap' the Lostprophets singer on her own and get 'evidence' against him. She said: 'We contacted each other again in May 2011 and by that time I had decided it was no good crying and sending him away anymore. 'I had to basically change the game and change my reaction and play him.' She said the next time he contacted her he told her he had gone to Los Angeles to listen to his album, and had raped a 12-year-old girl and plied her with cocaine. Mjadzelics first met Watkins in 2006 after going on the Lostprophets website looking for show tickets for a friend. She received a reply from someone called Ian who she eventually realised was Watkins and their online conversations became sexual with him inviting her to meet him at a Leeds hotel. Mjadzelics, who was working for a private bank, said Watkins filmed their first sexual encounter and later others too. She was arrested  in January 2013 for conspiracy to rape a baby. Her defence barrister said she damaged her health because of the 'incompetence and indifference' of the police and child agencies she asked for help. 'She is stressed, traumatised, has suffered a stroke, has disabling migraines', Michael Wolkind QC told jurors. The Independent Police Complaints Commission has three ongoing independent investigations into the response of South Wales Police, Bedfordshire Police and South Yorkshire Police to allegations that Watkins was abusing children. The trial was adjourned until Monday. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Joanne Mjadzelics allegedly discussed child abuse with singer Ian Watkins .

"The House of Representatives passed legislation on Thursday amending Obamacare to increase the number of hours workers must be on the clock for each week in order to qualify for health coverage through their employers. President Barack Obama has already warned that he won't sign the bill and not enough Members of Congress voted in favor of the proposed law to override the country's chief executive. The measure faces a rocky road in the Senate, as well, where Republicans also hold a slim, but not veto-proof, majority. At least 10 Democratic senators have already voiced strong opposition to the legislation. President Barack Obama, pictured here speaking today in Phoenix, Arizona, already warned that he won't sign the bill and not enough Members of Congress voted in favor of the proposed law to override him . The bill succeeded in the House on a vote of 252-172, with a dozen Democrats crossing party lines to vote for the health care reform legislation. If turned into law, the measure would redefine full-time employees that are eligible for health care coverage through their work places as those that are on the schedule for 40 hours a week, up from the current 30. The intent of the original rule was to broaden the number of Americans who are covered by their employers' health plans. Republicans argue that in effect the Obamacare provision has led businesses to cut back the number of hours it assigns to part-time workers in order to avoid the health care mandate. 'When middle-class Americans can’t work a full, 40-hour work week because of the president’s health care law, they can’t provide for their families, pay their bills, or get ahead in a tight economy,' House Speaker John Boehner said today. Earlier this week the White House said it would veto the legislation if it passed because it doesn't want to aid and abet business owners 'who are looking for loopholes' to get out out of taking 'responsibility' for their employee's health insurance. 'And we certainly don't think that we should make that easier. That's not good for the Affordable Care Act,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. 'It's not good for these workers.' 'What's clear is that the temptation that some employers might have would only be sweetened significantly if this Republican change...were to be put into place,' he said. Boehner fired back today that Obama's veto threat is 'a sad commentary on where his priorities lie.' 'House Republicans will continue putting Americans’ priorities first, and the president ought to reconsider his opposition to this bill and start doing the same,' he said. If every member of the Republican caucus showed up to vote, the GOP would still need nearly 45 Democratic representatives to vote for the bill in the House to cancel out Obama's objection. When the lower chamber voted on the legislation last session it was able stir up six more Democratic votes than it did today, but nowhere near enough to challenge the president. House Speaker John Boehner fired back today that Obama's veto threat is 'a sad commentary on where his priorities lie' The legislation never made it to the floor of the Democratic-led Senate in the 113th Congress. Now that Republicans run the legislative body, it is expected to pass. Still, Republicans have just 54 votes in the upper chamber and would need more than a third of the Democratic caucus to flip sides to nullify a veto. As soon as the House passed its version of the legislation a group of 10 Democratic senators issued statements lambasting the measure. 'This misguided proposal would actually create the problem it’s pretending to solve,' Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy said. 'By moving the threshold to 40 hours, a worker who already receives health coverage through their job could see their schedule cut by just one hour a week – to 39 hours instead of 40 – and their family’s health care taken away,' he contended. 'That’s not just counterproductive, it’s wrong.' Washington Sen. Patty Murray called the proposal 'unacceptable' and argued that it would 'actually encourage companies to game the system by cutting time for the millions of workers who work more than 40 hours. The senators argued that the legislation could raise the deficit by $53 billion while hanging millions of workers out to dry. 'After voting more than 50 times to repeal it, it is simply outrageous that Republicans are once again trying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act with a bill that would deny workers access to affordable health coverage through their employer and add billions to the deficit,' California Sen. Barbara Boxer said. Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow accused Republicans of being 'fixated on denying quality, affordable health care to millions of Americans.' 'Instead of wasting more time on a bill that would add tens of billions of dollars to the deficit and put the health insurance of millions of workers at risk, we should be focused on finding ways to make sure even more families gain secure, affordable coverage,' she said. In addition to the bill making changes to the employer mandate portion of the health care law President Obama said this week he'd toss out two other pieces of legislation if they came across his desk: a bill fast tracking approval of the Keystone XL pipeline and a measure that the White House believes would weaken consumer protections included in the 2010 Dodd-Frank banking bill. The House has plans to vote on Keystone tomorrow. It already passed the bill affecting Wall Street but the vote failed to satisfy a procedural rule so the House must again vote on it if is to be formally approved.","The legislation amends Obamacare to increase the number of hours workers must be on the clock in order to qualify for health coverage .

"Prestigious hotel Gleneagles is selling off an acre of land on a neighbouring street for £1million – with a golf course membership thrown in. Located just yards from the 2014 Ryder Cup PGA Centenary Course and with planning permission for a 'substantial' six-bedroom house, it could be a golfer's dream home. The price of the land on one of Scotland's most expensive streets has been slashed from £1.55million to £1million, despite a similar neighbouring plot selling for £1.7million. But the lucky purchaser will still have to dig deeply to build the six-bedroom home in Auchterarder, Perthshire, as it has permission for a four-car garage, pool, gym and sauna. The one-acre plot located yards from one of the golf courses at Gleneagles is on the market for £1million . The buyers will also  get two years' free golf club membership and access to all the luxury facilities. While the plot is already hooked up to mains water and electricity, it will have to be connected to the Gleneagles Hotel private drainage scheme, for which an annual levy will be payable. Anna Gardiner, for selling agents Savills, said: 'Caledonian Crescent is a broad private street lined with substantial houses set within generous and established gardens. 'In recent years it had become known as one of the Scotland's premier residential streets. The world-famous hotel (pictured) in Scotland has three championship course - the King's Course, the Queen's Course and the Centenary Course - as well as the nine hole 'Wee Course' The plot on the right was sold for £1.7million but the price of the remaining acre (left) has been slashed to £1million . 'A number of substantial modern mansions have been built on the sites of some of the original dwellings or on greenfield sites at the foot of the crescent. 'It is a great opportunity, especially as the plot is fully serviced and good to go. 'The setting is second to none in such a peaceful position so close to all the Gleneagles Hotel facilities.' She added that the price tag will afford the buyer a secluded and exclusive retreat. 'It's all about exclusivity. The site is pretty special - you don't get this quality of plot anywhere else,' she said. 'It's really a lifestyle you are buying into. The kind of people who will be interested will be looking for a substantial house. An artist's impression of what the six-bedroom house in Caledonian Crescent, Auchterarder, could look like . The buyers will also get two years' free golf club membership and access to all the luxury facilities, pictured is the entrance to the plot . 'Golf is obviously the big draw but also the fact that the hotel facilities are on your doorstep, giving you access to fine dining and the spa.' The five star hotel - dubbed a 'Riviera in the Highlands' - charges up to £2,000-a-night for a suite. It counts the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge among its high profile guests, along with Sir Sean Connery and John Travolta. Last year, the golf course was the venue for Ryder Cup, and residents of Auchterarder, despite living a few minutes' walk away, enjoyed shuttle buses to the event. The plot for sale in Caledonian Crescent has previously been on the market for over £1.55million and a neighbouring, almost identical piece of land, was snapped up for £1.7million a few years ago. In 2009 the street was named as the most expensive in Scotland by the property website Zoopla, with the average house price sitting at £1.6million . When it was opened in 1924, Gleneagles was described as 'a Riviera in the Highlands' and 'the eighth wonder of the world' Rettie estate agent Chris Hall said: 'Only one sold for £1.67m. Gleneagles withdrew the second hoping the market conditions would improve.' The agent admitted: 'The plot price has come down significantly. To buy a plot for £1million or more and develop a house is a significant investment. 'People who can afford that already have nice houses. It's a discretionary decision rather than one driven by a need.' He said: 'The current reduced price level is an attractive opportunity for some people. 'For those familiar with Gleneagles, Caledonian Crescent is very well known. There are six very substantial new build homes with build costs ranging from £2million to £7million. 'I'm not aware of any other street that rivals it in that respect.' Residents of Caledonian Crescent only have a five minute stroll to the entrance to the hotel, where they can dine in the two star Michelin restaurant run by Andrew Fairlie. In 2007 Strathearn Lodge on Caledonian Crescent was labelled the most expensive new home on sale in the country being marketed at offers over £3.75million. Meanwhile the street came out top of Zoopla's Scottish Property Rich List . In 2009 the street was named as the most expensive in Scotland by the property website Zoopla, with the average house price sitting at £1.6million. The world-famous hotel in Scotland has three championship courses, the King's Course, the Queen's Course and the Centenary Course as well as the nine hole 'Wee Course'. When it was opened in 1924, Gleneagles was described as 'a Riviera in the Highlands' and 'the eighth wonder of the world'. It most recently hosted the 2014 Ryder Cup which saw Team Europe beat Team USA 16½ to 11½ to complete a hat-trick of successive wins in the tournament. The hotel was built by the former Caledonian Railway Company, with its own railway station just minutes away, and is now owned by Diageo plc. In 1919 The King's and Queen's courses opened on the same day, but  The King's but was only nine holes until it was completed as a full 18 in 1925. When the Second World War broke out in 1939 the hotel closed and became a military hospital and then a miners' rehabilitation centre. It reopened as a hotel in May 1947. In 1993 the PGA Centenary Course, created by Jack Nicklaus, opened to complement the renowned King's and Queen's courses and form one of the world's finest golfing venues.","Gleneagles is selling an acre of land on a neighbouring street for £1m .

"A former Charlie Hebdo  employee has revealed that the satirical French newspaper will be published next week despite the barbaric assassinations of ten of it's journalists yesterday. Journalist Caroline Fourest, who worked for the paper in 2011, has claimed that the terrorist attack on the publication's Paris offices, which left twelve people dead, will not silence their cartoonists. Speaking to the ABC, Ms Fourest said past and present employees of the paper will band together to ensure a new edition of Charlie Hebdo will hit newsstands next Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Vigil: People gather around candles and pens at the Place de la Republique in Paris in support of the victims after the terrorist attack . Faces of the victims: Among the journalists killed were (l to r) Charlie Hebdo's deputy chief editor  Bernard Maris and cartoonists Georges Wolinski, Jean Cabut, aka Cabu, Stephane Charbonnier, who is also editor-in-chief, and Bernard Verlhac, also known as Tignous . 'We have all decided, the journalists who survived and their ex-colleagues, that we are going to have a meeting tomorrow to publish the next Charlie Hebdo, because there is no way, even if they killed 10 of us, that the newspaper won't be out next week,' Ms Fourest said. She revealed that the journalists of Charlie Hebdo would often try to play down threats against the paper and laugh about people who were offended by the anti-religious publication. 'All the time when we met we tried to make fun and joke about the crazy stupid people who were violent enough to be afraid of a simple cartoon,' Ms Fourest said. 'They can continue to be afraid, because there will be more cartoons. How the attack unfolded: This graphic shows the route taken by the gunmen who stormed the offices of Charlie Hebdo at about 11.25am . A former employee of Charlie Hebdo has said the publication will not be silenced . Fourest was working for the publication when it was firebombed after publishing a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad. After the attack, editor Stéphane Charbonnier said: 'I'd rather die standing than live on my knees'. He was gunned down by the terrorists Wednesday. Ms Fourest's claims come after a French official close to the case revealed 18-year-old Hamyd Mourad from the north-eastern city of Reims had surrendered to police 'after seeing his name on social media' linked to the crime. He was reportedly arrested at an undisclosed location. 'Not afraid': People gather to pay their respects for the victims of the terror attack against the satirical newspaper, in Paris last night . Among those killed were Stephane Charbonnier, 47, the magazine’s editor (left) and cartoonist Bernard ‘Tignous’ Verlhac, 57 (right) Jean Cabut, also known as Cabu, (left) and economist and contributor Bernard Maris (right) were also among the 12 victims killed yesterday . Said Kouachi, 34, and Cherif Kouachi, 32, both from Paris, have also been identified as two of the suspects linked to the deadly terrorist attacked on the newspaper. They are still at large. Anti-terrorism officers hunting the terrorists issued photographs of the two brothers describing them as 'armed and dangerous'. The terrifying attack occurred on Wednesday morning, after two heavily armed gunmen emerged from a black Citreon car dressed in black balaclavas at 11.20am. Cartoonist Philippe Honore (left) was a regular contributor who was killed as well as Michel Renaud (right) who was guest editing the magazine . Georges Wolinksi, pictured with his wife, was one of the cartoonists shot dead . Both men were carrying Kalashnikovs and one of the men was brandishing a rocket-propelled grenade launcher. They stormed the offices of the popular newspaper, identifying editor Stephane Charbonnier and gunning him down, along with his bodyguard and three other cartoonists. At least four more journalists, who were reportedly involved in a weekly editorial meeting, were also killed by the gunmen. Suspects: The three men were named as Cherif Kouachi (left), 32, his brother Said Kouachi (right), 34, and Hamyd Mourad, 18, of Gennevilliers . Response: Police are seen during an operation in the Croix-Rouge suburb of Reims, northern France, early this morning following the attacks . Witnesses have claimed that the men shouted “Allahu akbar!” as they launched the vicious attack on the journalists. The terrorists escaped, running down a pedestrian during their getaway. They also encountered a police car outside the offices, gunning down the wounded policeman who staggered from the car. The men dumped their car about two miles from the Charlie Hebdo offices, making away in a Renault Clio.","A former employee of Charlie Hebdo says a new edition of the paper will be on newsstands next week .

"Caught: Police revealed that a Minnesota's Representative Kerry Gauthier had a sexual encounter with a 17-year-old boy . After police revealed that a Minnesota lawmaker had a sexual encounter with a 17-year-old boy, both Republicans and Democrats have banded together to ask Representative Kerry Gauthier not to seek re-election. Representative Gauthier had been hospitalized in the wake of the scandal, denying any and all interview requests. Charges will not be pressed against the high-profile politician as the sex, which occurred at a Duluth rest stop, was found to be consensual. 'I am deeply disappointed with Rep Kerry Gauthier’s conduct,' Minnesota House Minority Leader Paul Thissen said in a statement to the Duluth News Tribune. 'The conduct was wrong and no one in the DFL House caucus condones the behavior. I expect he will address these issues publicly and soon.' Previously, Republicans lobbied for his resignation. 'I believe we have given Rep. Gauthier and the Democrat caucus a respectful amount of time to address this situation on their own,' House Speaker Kurt Zellers, R-Maple Grove, said Friday. 'Rep. Gauthier’s actions are not becoming of a member of the House of Representatives, and today I am calling on him to resign from the Legislature.' Mr Gauthier was treated for shortness of breath following the public investigation of his interactions with a 17-year-old teen he met on Craigslist. The two met for a rendezvous on July 22 at the Thompson Hill rest stop around 11 p.m. The Duluth News Tribune reported that a state trooper happened upon the pair after a report of 'suspicious activity.' Police reports of the incident reveal that Mr Gauthier, 56, put out an ad for an encounter on Craigslist and the 17-year-old responded. The two walked to a wooded area behind the rest stop pavilion for five minutes, where they engaged in oral sex and touching, police records show. Bipartisan: House Minority Leader and fellow Democrat Paul Thissen, left, as well as House Speaker and Republican Kurt Zellers, right, have condemned Mr Gauthier's actions . A trooper approached Mr Gauthier on his way back from the encounter. 'It was at that time I noted his zipper was open and part of his shirt was hanging out. I asked him why his zipper was down and he said he didn’t know,' the officer wrote in his police report. 'I told him to zip it up and leave. The male seemed nervous.' Then, the trooper said, he saw the teen. 'It was at that time I noted his zipper . was open and part of his shirt was hanging out. I asked him why his . zipper was down and he said he didn’t know. I told him to zip it up and leave.' State Trooper . 'He stated that he had met an older man at the rest area after corresponding with him in a response to a Craigslist ad,' the trooper wrote. The teen told the police that his parents were unaware of his sexual orientation and begged them not to tell his family of the incident. Both men said the interaction was consensual and there was no money exchanged. The teen also told police that he lied about his age, telling Mr Gauthier he was 18 years old. 'I think it’s a private matter and I don’t need to talk about it,' Mr Gauthier said to the Duluth News Tribune following the explosive investigation. No charges were pressed against the representative as the age of consent is 16 in Minnesota.","Representative Kerry Gauthier was found engaging in oral sex on July 22 .

"The Duchess of Cambridge's brother has failed to make a profit with his food business for the third year in a row, after recording an annual £23,000 loss. James Middleton's cake and bread brand Nice Group London Limited made a total loss of £23,353 for the 12 months to March 2014, accounts filed this week have shown. It means the company, which was set up in April 2011, is yet to post a profit, having lost £19,928 in its first year of trading and £21,148 in its second year. The company also owes creditors £76,394. The cake and bread business run by James Middleton, 27 (left), the brother of the Duchess of Cambridge (right), has lost more than £23,000 in its third year . A visit to the company's website today shows it is still under construction . Mr Middleton, 27, has again had to ask his family for financial help for the business, according to the accounts filed at Companies House. Under a section entitled Creditors: Amounts falling due within one year, it reads: 'The bank overdraft is secured by a member of the director's family.' He told MailOnline: 'My focus over the last year has been on Boomf as it really has taken off. 'We managed to secure £1million in funding and are up 320 per cent from last Christmas, we are shipping all over the world and we are also in Selfridges printing onto marshmallows there and then. 'We have our first TV advert coming out next month, which is very exciting and we are launching new products this year so my energy has been focused on Boomf.' He added: 'This will be a deciding year for Nice Group.' Mr Middleton, a former public school boy, dropped out of the University of Edinburgh in 2006 after a year of studying to go into business. He set up Nice Group London in 2011, the same year sister Kate married Prince William. But he has so far failed to recreate the success of his parents, Carol and Michael, who made millions with their own Party Pieces venture. Mr Middleton has defended his losses in previous years, telling MailOnline: 'Nice Group is a start-up company and as you can imagine there are overheads needed to start a company. The former public school boy has had to ask his family for financial help. He is pictured with his other sister Pippa (left) who has her own budding career in journalism . 'It is not uncommon for start-up companies to make a loss in the early stages of development and it is not something I am concerned about right now.' Nice Group London is registered to the family's trading headquarters close to their Berkshire home. It filed the accounts signed by Mr Middleton - the sole director and shareholder - with Companies House. The paperwork covers the company's third full year of trading. Mr Middleton is also a director at Nice Cakes, which sells things such as personalised cupcakes which have company logos and photographs printed in edible ink. It caused controversy in its early days by selling a line of adult-themed cakes iced with naughty slogans. These included a 'stud muffin' cake featuring a picture of a man and the caption: 'A willy that wriggles and gives me the giggles'. Another is the Cake Kit Company, which sells bits needed to make different styles of birthday cakes, including a princess-like doll. Hopefully the budding entrepreneur will have better luck with the bespoke marshmallow company he founded, Boomf - which sells nine marshmallows for $25 (£15).","James Middleton runs cake and bread company Nice Group London Ltd .

"Singles holidays are on the rise, with the biggest surge in demand from the over 50s traveller, according to research out today. Holiday companies that run group tours in the UK and overseas are reporting that 35 per cent of their clients now travel alone and they expect this figure to rise to 38 per cent in 2015, based on advance bookings. As a result, many holiday companies, including Cox & Kings, Caribtours and Journey Latin America are offering incentives to attract people who are single, divorced or widowed, such as dedicated holidays for people travelling alone and, increasingly, the scrapping of single supplements. More and more of us are opting for singles holidays with the over 50s having the highest demand . The analysis of 100,000 holiday bookings was carried out by 101 Holidays which has launched a new website to meet the demand, 101 Singles Holidays. The site has 101 suggestions for solo travellers selected by the award-winning travel writer, Cathy Winston. Winston said: 'Travelling solo has lost much of the lonely hearts stigma it once carried. And it's not limited to the 18-30 age group backpacking around the world, with single people of all ages feeling more confident about travelling alone, especially women. Greece remains the most popular destination for singles, with a nice mix of sun, sea and.... other singles . New trips such as trkking in Nepal are becoming popular with people who go away on their own . 'Our research showed that the average age of a solo traveller is now 54 and this is predicted to rise in future years. 'Not everyone holidaying alone is single, with more women leaving husbands and partners at home as they tick items off their bucket lists. The new figures also reflect changing UK demographics with a growing population that is older, healthier and wealthier.' 1. Greece . 2. Portugal . 3. St Lucia . 4. Laos . 5. Sri Lanka . 6. Singapore . 7. USA . 8. Costa Rica . 9. Turkey . 10. Vietnam (as part of a small group tour) According to the research, 58.3 per cent of single holidaymakers are female. But that figure rises for more active and exotic trips such as walking holidays (64 per cent) and African safaris (60 per cent). Men are more likely to take cycling and sailing trips. The most popular destination for dedicated singles holidays is Greece, followed by Turkey, but travel companies say many solos are increasingly looking for adventure. Popular trips include cruises on the River Nile, trekking in Nepal, viewing the Northern Lights and gorilla trekking in Rwanda. The report by 101 Holidays is supported by research from the Association of British Travel Agents. Its 2014 Consumer Holiday Trends Report found that 13 per cent of UK holidaymakers now travel alone. But, it said, 'for people aged over 65 the figure rises to 21 per cent, suggesting older age groups are among the most independent when it comes to taking holidays'. Cathy Winston added: 'Increasingly, travel companies are waking up to the fact that single travellers are big business with a huge choice of solo holidays now on offer, and some are negotiating with hotels to remove the dreaded single supplements. This is a trend that looks only set to increase.' The Northern Lights can offer a supremely peaceful moment that can be enjoyed whether with others or alone . Cathy also points to an increasing growth in single parent holidays, with several companies scrapping supplements for mums or dads travelling alone with their kids. Recent years have also seen a sharp hike in self-development and learning holidays which are growing in popularity among singles - including meditation, yoga, pilates, weight loss, cookery courses and creative writing. To make your booking on a singles holiday, visit www.101singlesholidays.co.uk . Making friends and joining a 'group' is a good way to stay safe on holiday . Look confident . Look like you know where you're going even if you don't, and always try to learn a few key words in the local language including 'help'. Do your research . Spontaneous travel is wonderful but a bit of advance planning goes a long way. Try to memorise routes so you needn't look at maps too often, and try to avoid arriving late at night, but book taxis/transfers/accommodation in advance if you can't avoid that. Expat blogs can also be a great source of tips and information. Dress sensibly . You'll attract more negative attention and mark yourself out as a tourist by wearing inappropriate clothes. Instead look at the advice on what travellers should wear to ensure it's respectful to local culture, and you're more likely to blend in. Join a group . If you're planning a more intrepid adventure and you're nervous about going solo, book a group tour with a travel company specialising in your destination as there's often a large proportion travelling solo. For something more informal check out websites like Travbuddy, Wandermates and Meetup, to help you you meet other solo travellers. Don't forget common sense . You wouldn't be careless with your valuables or walk alone at night in a strange city in the UK, so don't do it while you're travelling. Danger doesn't lurk around every corner but do stay alert. Book a guide . If you're worried about being hassled, a guide is a great barrier. Even a short tour will help you find your bearings and get advice from a local before venturing out alone. Learn to say no politely . Declining firmly with a smile and a thank you is the quickest way to deter all but the most insistent without unintentionally causing offence. Trying to stay relatively sober if travelling as a single on holiday is a good idea . Stay (fairly) sober . Travel is all about enjoying yourself but having one too many drinks is a shortcut to potentially unsafe situations, whether that's being more inclined to take risks or simply getting lost. Protect your paperwork . Make scans of all your important documents, especially your passport, with a copy safely stored online, for example with Dropbox. Then if something is stolen, you can easily access the back-up. And always get a note of your hotel's address and phone number, written in the local alphabet if it's different. Trust your instincts . If something feels wrong or someone makes you feel uncomfortable, don't ignore your instincts for the sake of politeness. There's usually a good reason for your gut reaction so if you feel even slightly unsafe, get out as fast as possible.","Prediction that 38 per cent of customers in 2015 will be travelling solo .

"A half-deaf pensioner who annoyed her neighbours by constantly blasting out Bhangra music has been ordered to pay more than £2,000. Satinder Kholi, 72, repeatedly ignored warnings about playing loud music from her house and back garden after being served a noise abatement notice in July 2013. Magistrates heard she continually breached the order by playing Sound Asia FM tunes from her property in Kings Heath, Birmingham, at all hours of the day and night. Satinder Kholi, pictured, repeatedly ignored warnings about playing loud music at her property in Kings Heath, Birmingham. She was ordered to pay more than £2000 in court costs . Yesterday, the pensioner was found guilty in her absence at Birmingham Magistrates Court of three offences under the Environmental Protection Act. She was fined £400 and ordered to pay court costs of £1,747 as well as a £40 victim surcharge. The court heard Birmingham City Council had already brought a case against Kholi and she was fined in September last year for playing loud music. But she continued to blast out tunes from her radio and environmental health officers received more complaints about noise levels at her home. An environmental health officer visited her home on July 30 last year and heard loud music coming from Ms Kholi's home. A tape recorder was installed and recordings made over two days in August reached levels that constituted a 'statutory noise nuisance.' On August 29, officers seized Ms Kholi's radio, television and laptop. Birmingham magistrates heard she continually breached the noise abatement order she was served with in July 2013 . She was charged with three counts of contravening or failing to comply with an abatement notice under Environmental Protection Act. Councillor Barbara Dring, who chairs the city council's Licensing and Public Protection Committee, said: 'Our officers have received numerous complaints about loud music coming from Ms Kholi's home since April 2013 and she was served with a noise abatement notice in July 2013. 'However, officers continued to receive complaints and, as a result, seized audio equipment from her home on three occasions. 'Despite being asked to turn down the volume, she has repeatedly broken the terms of this notice and shown a lack of respect for her neighbours' welfare and wellbeing - so I am pleased to hear she's been found guilty of these offences.' Her daughter Anita Mukherjee, 44, said her mother was partially deaf and was not bothering anybody with her music. She added: 'It is just one neighbour who complained. My mother is deaf in one ear. She entitled to lead her life, she's not bothering anyone. 'Playing music in the day time doesn't hurt anyone. They also confiscated our LG TV, radio, laptop and about 50 music CDs, a DVD player and eight DVDs. 'She doesn't listen to music loudly or at antisocial hours.'","Satinder Kholi, 72, repeatedly ignored warnings about playing loud music .

"Death: Joan Parkes, pictured, was found dead in her hospital bed by her own daughter on a routine visit . A pensioner's daughter found her mother dead in a hospital bed as she arrived for a routine visit - and medics had not yet noticed. Joan Parkes was admitted to Good Hope Hospital with a chest infection following a fall last March at her home nearby in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands. But her daughter Eleanor Johnson said that when she paid a visit six days later, she discovered her mother's body 'still warm' in the hospital bed. Mrs Johnson raised the alarm only to discover a 'Do Not Resuscitate' notice had been put on her mother's notes without her consent, despite Mrs Parkes having a history of depression. According to Mrs Johnson, nurses said they had checked on her mother half an hour before she arrived for the routine visit at 2.30pm on April 3, and the 88-year-old was alive. But she hit out at the hospital over its care of her mother, who died of pneumonia and frailty. 'She deserved better care,' the school dinner lady told the Birmingham Mail. 'I am angry. 'The hospitals are bursting at the seams, so I have tried to make allowances for that. But she was failed, in some aspects, at the most basic levels. 'I arrived on the ward and had to tell them that she was dead. She just looked asleep. She was still warm. 'They felt her pulse, and they said ""no I'm sorry, she's gone"". I said, ""can nothing be done?"" - and they said ""no, because she's agreed to this DNAR"". 'I was shocked. It was the first I heard of it. If she had been so poorly to discuss a DNAR with her, why on earth hadn't they called a member of the family? 'Pneumonia hadn't even been mentioned to me. We had seen her the previous day and not one of us thought that this could have happened within 24 hours. Instead of being seen by the critical team, the nursing staff washed her hair. It's unbelievable.' The hospital has apologised to Mrs Johnson after she lodged a catalogue of claims, including that nurses miscalculated the pensioner's 'early warning score' showing how ill she was. Had they calculated it correctly, claimed Mrs Johnson, it would have led to an immediate call to the critical outreach team and a junior doctor. Justice: The pensioner's daughter Eleanor Johnson (pictured) said: 'The hospitals are bursting at the seams, so I have tried to make allowances for that. But she was failed, in some aspects, at the most basic levels' And she said nurses failed to check on aspects of the grandmother's care for more than seven hours, instead of every 30 minutes, and failed to give Mrs Parkes her anti-anxiety medication Sertraline for three days. Good Hope Hospital apologised to Mrs Johnson in a letter, which admits her mother was 'let down', and have mounted an investigation into the full circumstances of the incident. She added: 'If they had observed my mum like they should, and alerted the critical team like they should, it's possible she wouldn't have died that day. 'Observations were missed, medication was missed, documentation was missed and communication was awful. 'On the surface her care appeared OK, but when I looked at the medical notes they told a different story. 'They let Mum down, they let me down, they let the family down. So I think they looked at her and thought ""well, she's 88"". I think that does go on a lot in hospitals today.' Tales: Good Hope Hospital made headlines just days ago for not realising a pensioner was virtually blind . Mrs Parkes was admitted to the hospital by paramedics on March 28 following a fall at her home. She had visited her GP the day before with a small chest infection and was prescribed antibiotics. She died on April 3 from pneumonia and frailty. Mrs Johnson added: 'My mum had a long history of depression and anxiety. Mrs Parkes' daughter said: 'I don't want another family to go through this' 'Without my knowledge her medication hadn't been given to her for three days. We had been warned by her GP that this could lead to serious side-effects. 'Alone, feeling ill and depressed, I doubt she had the mental capacity to make such a weighty decision regarding a ""Do Not Resuscitate"" notice herself. 'I don't want another family to go through this. I could have looked after her better at home.' Richard Parker, the hospital's managing director, said: 'We take the safety and care of all of our patients very seriously and have undertaken a detailed investigation into the care Mrs Parkes received. 'I would like to apologise to Mrs Johnson and would welcome an opportunity to meet with her to discuss any aspect of her mother's care during her time here.' The case was revealed days after it emerged a pensioner was found dehydrated and groping for food at the same hospital because nurses failed to realise she was virtually blind. Good Hope also apologised for its care of 82-year-old Margaret Jones, who was admitted following a fall in June. Staff were told the pensioner's eyes could only pick out light and dark, said her daughter Rosalind Waite-Jones, but put food and medicine out of her reach. Mrs Jones later suffered a serious infection which has impeded her brain function and left her in a care home for the rest of her life.","Joan Parkes died at Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield, W Midlands .

"The owner of a bridal shop linked to Ebola nurse Amber Vinson announced this week that the store was closing because it lost significant business and has been stigmatized. Miss Vinson, a nurse at Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, was diagnosed with Ebola days after visiting Coming Attractions Bridal & Formal store in Akron, Ohio in October. The store temporarily closed and cleaned before reopening in November but business has failed to bounce back. Scroll down for video . Anna Younker, who owns Coming Attractions Bridal & Formal store in Akron, Ohio, announced this week that she would be closing her doors after the business never recovered following a visit from Ebola patient Amber Vinson last year . Sanitation workers enter the bridal shop in Akron, Ohio in October after nurse Amber Vinson visited the store days before she was diagnosed with Ebola . Owner Anna Younker, who has been in business for 30 years, said her shop has become known as the 'Ebola store'. She told the Akron Beacon Journal that the temporary closure and canceled orders cost the store at least $100,000.  The loss wasn't covered by her insurance because the plan excludes viral illnesses. Ms Younker told NewsNet5 that Miss Vinson, who was visiting her hometown for a few days to plan for her wedding, should have been more careful. 'I wish that now she knew better not to travel. The impact its had on me is huge,' the store owner said. 'Never in a million years did I expect something like this to cause our business to have to close.' Shop assistant Kayla Litz, who is about to lose her job, had a particularly worrying time during the Ebola scare because she is pregnant . Ms Younker said she was particularly offended when Miss Vinson, 29, asked  for a $480 refund on her bridesmaid dresses. Miss Vinson, who has since recovered from Ebola, asked that the shop refund her bridesmaids the $479.89 they paid for their dresses, via her attorney. Ms Younker said the refund request feel like 'a slap in the face'. On Wednesday, the store owner posted a message to customers on Facebook, announcing that her business would be closing down. 'Despite our best efforts, we simply have been unable to recover,' she wrote. 'The decision for me to close was not easy for me. 'Over the years I have met and worked with the most amazing brides, mothers of brides, bridesmaids, prom girls and many other wonderful people. 'I want to thank all our customers, the people in our community and the well wishers from afar for being so supportive. Your kind words and loyalty have been great comfort. 'I also want to thank my amazing staff for all of their hard work and dedication to our customers and our business. I appreciate your understanding and support.' One of the four staff members losing their jobs, Kayla Litz, told NewsNet5 that the Ebola scare had been particularly worrying for her because she was in her first trimester of pregnancy at the time. Ms Litz came through the quarantine period of 21 days Ebola-free along with the other employees of the store. The store will take orders until the end of January and then sell dresses at discounts and liquidate all assets.","Coming Attractions Bridal & Formal store in Akron, Ohio announced its closure this week after it never recovered from its association with Ebola .

"Having grown up in the public eye, I’ve probably developed a thicker skin than most. A little over a year ago, however, I was photographed at the beach - already an annually scarring ordeal - and some less than flattering bikini photos started appearing online. I felt pretty terrible about myself, and promptly embarked on a diet rampage. I juiced, I did Atkins, I ate only vegetables, I hired a personal trainer and took up Bikram yoga; even tried laser liposuction. None of it worked. Then, in January of last year, I made a discovery that changed my life. I got myself tested for food allergies and spent the next ten months re-adjusting my diet to cut out my (rather random-seeming) triggers - dairy, yeast, tuna, pecans and celery. Scroll down for video . Success: Upon seeing this photo of herself  in 2013 (left), Sophie Simmons, 22, was determined to lose weight. After numerous fad diets, an allergy test triumphed and she lost ten pounds (right, now) I didn’t lose an enormous amount of weight - dropping from 170lbs to 160lbs over a year - but my body shape changed drastically. My belly, love handles and butt diminished, my skin cleared up and my energy levels soared. I was first introduced to this concept while on a health retreat at the Canyon Ranch in Tucson, Arizona. I was at the tail-end of my three month fad-dieting blitz and I was of the opinion - having been raised in Hollywood - that anyone could lose weight if they juiced for long enough. Still, for whatever reason, that just wasn’t what my body wanted. Before and after: Sophie, pictured in 2013 (left) and now (right), discovered she had minor to moderate allergies to a number of foods which was making it hard for her to lose weight . I was skeptical at first when the team at Canyon Ranch tested my blood and urine for allergies. I had never appeared to suffer any as a child; no puffy face from peanuts or angry reactions to strawberries. I do, however, get eczema from time to time, and this was cause enough for the nutritionist to suggest I get tested. Low and behold, that small red rash that I had always ignored turned out to be the result of a whole host of food allergies. Allergens are rated on a scale from one to five, five being the most severe. At a five, you’ll see physical reactions such as hives, throat swelling and face numbness. At a ‘one’ or a ‘two’ you might see, to a varying degree, gas or excess body weight. On this scale, I was rated a ‘one’ for celery, a ‘two’ for tuna and pecans, and a ‘three’ for yeast and dairy. Transformation: After cutting out her allergens completely but never denying herself of other foods, Sophie noticed the shape of body change dramatically . Lifestyle shift: Sophie, pictured (left) in May 2011 and (right) in December 2014, was initially skeptical about getting tested for allergies but has since admitted it changed her life . I was advised to cut out all my allergens completely for a period of time - I went for ten months - to see how I how I did. Food allergens are rated on a scale from one to five, five being the most severe . At the lower end, reactions can trigger excess gas, irritability and weight gain . At the higher end, symptoms include hives, throat swelling and numbness . Combining different allergens on the scale can cause a more severe reaction than consuming them alone . Cutting out all allergens for a period of time can result in weight loss and better health . Simply experimenting by eliminating common allergens - including yeast and dairy - might enable you to avoid costly testing . There is a science to allergens and a reason I hadn’t noticed them before. Because I only have allergies at levels ‘three’ and below, I don’t experience the physical symptoms typical of a more severe reaction. But I was gaining weight because of them. And while consumed solo these effects are less, when I combine allergens I do react. If I eat a ‘two’ and a ‘three’ together - tuna with cheese for example - I will break out in a rash or get tired and irritable. It’s a new numbers game I had to learn to play. At first, I felt like I had nothing to eat. My world went from cuisine to plain chicken and veggies, excluding celery. I hadn’t realized how much of my diet contained dairy and yeast. It was staggering. Still, I was on board and disciplined, and I learned as I went along. I was never once hungry, just eating different sorts of foods. Stayed active: Sophie, pictured in 2013 (left) and now (right) never changed her exercise regime, which involves hiking and going the gym, but after she cut out her allergens, she started seeing real results . Within the first two months, I had lost around ten pounds. This may not have been ‘fat’ per se. Call it toxins, water weight or extra lovin’ - whatever it was, it left my body. I didn’t lose any more weight but I kept the ten pounds off and what surprised me most what the changing shape of my figure. My goal after that changed. I no longer wanted to lose weight, I wanted to hone my natural figure. I’ve never been a gym freak, but I stay active, and the amount of exercise I was doing hadn’t changed - it was just having a different effect. I hike with my dogs a few times a week for an hour and I hit the gym when I can to walk and jog on the treadmill or lift light weights. But unlike before, I’m no longer feeding my body with foods that are toxic to it, so I’ve finally been seeing real results from my workouts. Model: Sophie has launched two clothing lines - pictured, her New Year's Eve collection for Sophie Simmons x The Style Club - and makes it a policy never to have her photos Photoshopped . Family: Sophie (left) pictured with her mother, ex-Playboy Playmate Shannon Tweed (center left), her father, Kiss legend Gene Simmons (center right) and her brother Nick Simmons (right) A year later, I’m slowing reintroducing some of my lower scale allergens, like celery, back into my diet. I don’t think I will ever fully embrace dairy or yeast again. On every occasion I’ve slipped up on that - my belly has bloated. And there are so many other food options that keep my body happy. If I’ve learned anything about my body over the last year, it’s that we all respond to food and exercise differently. We can’t expect juicing and sweating it out at spin class to be a blanket fix-all. If you don’t want to shell out for the allergy test, which I admit can be expensive, then try cutting out dairy and yeast - which are very common triggers - to start, and see how you feel. It’s all about giving your body the best tools to succeed. I’ve launched two clothing lines in the last few months which I modeled myself, and far from being horrified by paparazzi photos of my derriere, these days I make it a policy to never have my images re-touched or Photoshopped. I’m proud of my bikini body now. I’ve got curves in all the right places, and most importantly of all: I’m healthy, not hungry.","Writing for Femail, the 22-year-old details how she lost ten pounds after cutting out the foods she was unknowingly allergic to .

"Losing a beloved dog can be like losing a member of the family, but one artist has come up with a clever solution to comfort grieving pet owners.

Lucy Francis Maloney creates miniature replicas of deceased dogs for grieving owners . Lucy who lives in Saint Paul, Minnesota, came up with the idea in 1997 when her parents suggested creating a miniature version of their family dog, Old Ted, a Yorkshire terrier. Combining household items such as string and loose hair from her family pet, the first miniature mutt was born. Since then, she has created thousands of miniature dogs using yarn, chicken wire, and a selection of materials to replicate the fur including alpaca, cashmere, baby camel and occasionally real dog hair. Lucy creates her models using as little as an old photograph of the much-loved pet to work from . Lucy uses a selection of materials to replicate the fur including alpaca, cashmere and occasionally dog hair . Lucy has created thousands of dog models since she first started creating them in 1997 . The addition of glass eyes and fur grooming completes the life-like look. Having spent the last 18 years honing her skills, Lucy is now inundated with requests from pet owners across the world who are longing to resurrect their furry friends. Often spending hours to produce them with meticulous detail, customers from Netherlands, Russia, Qatar, Germany and the UK pay anything between $200 (£132) and $2,000 (£1326) on Lucy's website for her realistic models. Lucy  created her first miniature model when the family pet Old Ted, a Yorkshire terrier, died in 1997 . Lucy's creations have received so much attention that she now receives orders from all over the world . The prospect of keeping a souvenir of their passed-on-pup has even seen Lucy receive interest from celebrity dog lovers, with Martha Stewart, Andrew WK, Shirley McLaine, John Prine and Keither Sykes all requesting a petite pooch of their own. Lucy, owner of three dogs, says that she has been fascinated with pooches her whole life and this job means she can do what she loves. 'My passion for dogs has been with me since my earliest memory. All I wanted was to do something with dogs. The artist now charges between $200 (£132) and $2,000 (£1,326) for her miniature creations . Lucy has even had several celebrities get in touch wanting to purchase a model including Martha Stewart . 'I started working with miniatures when I created my old dog Ted, but soon word of my mini dogs reached other pet lovers and I started creating peoples' dogs exact to the photos.' Lucy says that her replicas provide something that a photograph of an old pet can't. 'People loved the idea of a three dimensional piece to remember and cherish their pet. 'Customers are usually reduced to tears when they see their dog brought back to life.' The 61-year-old says that people are generally reduced to tears when they receive their models . As well as dogs that have passed away Lucy creates miniatures of live hounds too . Lucy says that she can completely emphasise with her customers and says that it is really rewarding to help owners through a difficult time. 'When a dog is brought back to the owner in a realistic way it always brings emotions to the fore. I always work to get the dog as perfect as the real one. 'I love to reach people suffering that loss. I myself know the pain of losing a pet, combined with my unequalled love of dogs; I feel I have a profound understanding of the grief.' Dog artist Lucy (pictured) says that she is thrilled to help grieving owners . Lucy is currently creating a model for a man in the armed forces about to go on tour (dog not pictured) The artist believes that a 3D model can provide more comfort to grieving pet owners than a flat photo . Lucy has recently received a very special order that will see her work against the clock. 'I recently received an urgent request from a mom: her son is about to leave for his fourth tour in Afghanistan Special forces, but his dog just died suddenly.

"Italian winemakers have threatened to launch legal action against British pubs and bars which serve prosecco on tap . Italian winemakers have threatened to launch legal action against British pubs and bars which serve prosecco on tap. The group, backed by the Italian government, has warned that establishments could face fines of up to 20,000 euros unless they stop the 'illegal' trade of selling the sparkling drink from kegs. They insist that selling the fizzy wine in the same manner as lager or cider is illegal under EU laws, which state the drink must be sold by the bottle. The producers also say that drinking prosecco on tap ruins the taste of the drink and is causing damage to the industry's reputation. The consortium has now contacted the UK's Food Standards Agency and Intellectual Property Office in a bid to crack down on the new craze. They warn that those who refuse to stop the trade could be taken to court under European Union trading regulations and prosecuted for 'fraud'. Luca Giavi, the director of the consortium of winemakers in the Valdobbiadene-Conegliano area of the northern Veneto region, told The Telegraph:  'If prosecco is sold on tap then it is no longer prosecco – it needs to be served directly from the bottle. 'We're just trying to protect consumers – if they order a glass of prosecco, then that it what they should be getting.' The winemakers say that, under a European law from 2009, it is illegal to sell prosecco on tap and that it should be 'marketed exclusively in traditional glass bottles'. They have been backed by the Italian government, with one MP saying politicians will 'act immediately' to see how they 'can best discourage further violations'. Michele Anzaldi, an MP from the Democratic Party of Matteo Renzi, the prime minister, described it as a 'very serious abuse'. He said: 'It's one thing to drink prosecco, a protected brand, but quite another to drink pseudo-wine pumped with carbon dioxide, as seems to be served in some British pubs.' The Priory Bar in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, is one of those pubs which has introduced prosecco on tap at the establishment. But owner Marcus Hilton said he was forced to change the the name of the sparking wine to 'frizzante' after officials from the Food Standards Agency said he was in breach of EU regulations. The winemakers say that serving the fizzy drink in the same manner as lager and cider is bad for the reputation of the industry. Pictured: An Italian vineyard in Tuscany . He still supplies about 200 other venues with the wine and he says it is possible that not all the venues have done the same. He told The Independent: 'I’m now calling it frizzante. But obviously I can’t answer for the other 200 or so people I’m supplying it to,' Last year, Britain became the top export market for prosecco, overtaking Germany. Sales increased dramatically over Christmas and New Year. Demand for the popular fizz has rocketed to the point where it is being mass produced on a grand scale in factories in northern Italy. Locals pay around four or five euros (£3.31 to £3.92) for the low-quality bubbly but the price almost doubles by the time it gets to Britain. Traditional producers also say taste is being substituted for quantity as large cooperatives compete to satisfy Britain’s insatiable thirst for the drink. In some cases, producers are even topping up cheap ‘bulk wine’ with super-strength concentrate to make it more alcoholic after poor weather this summer affected the grapes. This summer, the harvest had been hit by bad weather leading to a 30 per cent drop in grapes.","Consortium contacted UK Food Standards Agency to crack down on craze .

Troublesome moggy Mya become an internet hit after getting herself jammed into a watering can. She has now gone missing from her home in Leicester . After she didn't come in one evening,  Charlotte King and her mother Mandy went calling all over their garden looking for Mya. With no luck, they put her food out and hoped she would soon reappear. But in the morning tortoiseshell Mya had still not come home and she has been missing ever since. Miss King, 24, from Leicester, said: 'I am really upset. She is a really homely cat and has never ventured more than four houses away. 'She climbs up trees then is scared to get down so she just starts meowing - I'm really worried as to what she might have got up to this time!' Mya, also known as May May, was a birthday present in December 2013 but the adventurous animal has been on a a campaign on mischief ever since. In just 12 months she has been stuck up trees, trapped on top of a shed roof and wedged under fences as well, as the near permanent jam in the watering can. in just 12 months the tortoise shell pet has also been stuck up trees, trapped on a shed roof, wedged under a fence .

Now, Miss King's other cat Missy is pining to have her back and Charlotte and her  46-year-old mother are campaigning to get Mya home and hoping a public appeal will see her returned. The mischievous moggy became an internet hit after she got stuck in the watering can on April 2 last year on the first day she was let out of the house to play. Worried: Dedicated owner Charlotte King fears spends hours each week rescuing her pet from mishaps and now fears for the animal's safety . The kitten disappeared and Charlotte couldn't find he anywhere until Mya's head then popped out of the watering can. Miss King said: 'She was just wondering what was going on. She kept meowing for me to get her out.' No amount of manoeuvring could help Mya wriggle out and Charlotte and her mother were forced to call in the fire brigade. Mandy said: 'We let her out in the garden and then could not find her. 'I could hear her meowing and thought 'where are you?' - and then her little head popped out of the watering can.

"The US military is to shrink its presence in Britain, closing three bases and slashing thousands of roles as part of a major shake-up of its overseas deployments. The closure of RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk alongside RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth in Cambridgeshire will see the number of US military personnel drop by around 2,000. Hundreds of British civilian workers will also lose their jobs as part of the cost-cutting. RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk, one of three U.S. air bases in Britain which will close shedding hundreds of jobs . Pentagon officials said that the US presence at RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk – the largest US Air Force combat base in Europe – will be beefed up with two squadrons comprising 48 of the new Lockheed Martin Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters, which will arrive by 2020. The closures are expected to save £320m ($500m) a year across Europe, US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said. He added: 'I know this will result in a reduction of our local host nations workforces at some locations. I value the tremendous support they have provided us for decades.' RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk is an historic airbase used by the U.S to defend Britain since 1950. It was opened in 1934 and went on to play a key part in WWII and the Cold War. Throughout the war, the base was involved in most of RAF Bomber Command's offensives against Germany. The base withstood several attacks by the German Luftwaffe, but was never put out of commission. By the end of the war, aircraft from RAF Mildenhall and its satellite airfields dropped more than 23,000 tons of explosives, laid 2,000 mines in enemy waters, and flew more than 8,000 sorties. After the war, RAF Mildenhall flew home prisoners of war and took part in other humanitarian missions. It is currently home to 3,200 military personnel, including the 352nd Special operations Group - the US special forces which fly secret missions - and the 100th Air Refuelling Wing, a fleet of air-to-air refuelling tankers. The latter are some of the most important elements of the U.S Air Force as they enable aircraft to reach targets and to remain over combat zones for the duration of the mission. RAF Alconbury, based in Huntingdon, and RAF Molesworth, near Molesworth, Cambridgeshire - once home to Cold War cruise missiles - are used as USAF communications bases, rather than for flying. They are the last Second World War-era Eighth Air Force bases in Britain that are still actively in use. Along with RAF Upwood, they are considered the 'Tri-Base Area' due to their close geographic proximity. RAF Mildenhall is the biggest base to close among 15 installations across Europe. The historic airfield is home to the 100th Air Refuelling Wing, which flies KC-135R tankers used for mid-air refuelling duties, as well as the 352nd Special Operations Group, which flies secret missions with its C-130 transport planes and CV-22 Osprey tiltrotors – a cross between an aircraft and helicopter. Mildenhall's special forces aircraft will be moved to Germany, the refuelling tankers will go to Germany but RC-135 surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft are set to move elsewhere in the UK. The Pentagon's European Infrastructure Consolidation review will see some 3,200 people moved from Mildenhall, with 400-500 civilian posts under threat. An additional 1,200 additional servicemen will go to Lakenheath to support the F-35. The US Department of Defense said the decision to base American F-35 aircraft in the UK reflected 'the closeness of the US-UK defense relationship and the military value of basing in the UK'. It added: 'The presence of U.S. F-35s at RAF Lakenheath will deepen our already close partnership and offer new opportunities for collaboration between the U.S. and UK.' Together, Lakenheath and Mildenhall contribute some £500million to the East Anglian economy each year and enjoy strong support from local people, many of whom work on the bases. Matthew Hancock, MP for West Suffolk, said: 'Mildenhall has a long and proud history of strong relations with the United States Air Force. With this deep history in mind news of the proposed closure of Mildenhall will come as a shock to many. 'I will do everything in my power to support those affected, and to make sure that Mildenhall gets the support it needs to adjust. I have met with the Defence Secretary, and others in Government to ensure we can work, together with the American administration, to support the community. Strategic: Matthew Hancock, the local MP for Mildenhall (pictured), said the town had 'a long and proud history of strong relations with the U.S. Air Force. The proposed closure will come as a shock to many' 'We will create a Mildenhall, Alconbury and Molesworth (MAM) Working Group, which I will chair, inviting local LEPs, councils, the Ministry of Defence, and US representatives to ensure no stone is left unturned in supporting Mildenhall and the surrounding area.' Last year, the two bases were flagged for potential closure by a RAND Corporation report into military cost-cutting. The Pentagon was understood to be concerned that Lakenheath and Mildenhall were too far away from Middle East trouble sports such as Iraq and Syria. But recent events in Ukraine and the potential for a new Cold War with Russia may have prompted a rethink, with the 48th Fighter Wing considered a vital outpost of US air power able to deploy its jets anywhere in the world with fewer than 24-hours notice. Unstable: The situation in Ukraine (pictured) may have prompted a rethink of the U.S. Air Force's facilities . The unit was recently sent to Lithuania to support the NATO North Atlantic alliance's Baltic air patrol mission and has established a reputation for always being among the first on the front line, having flown combat missions in both Iraq wars, Afghanistan and Libya. Lakenheath already has 4,500 military personnel and 2,000 civilians, who do everything from serving coffee in the restaurants to scaring birds away from its 9,000ft-long runway. Colonel Robert Novotny, commander of Lakenheath's 48th Fighter Wing, recently told the Mail he had not read the RAND report, adding: 'Commanders and politicians are going to make the decision. I don't think we're going anywhere any time soon.' Col Novotny said: 'This base has more fighter aircraft than almost all the rest of the other American bases in Europe. This base as a combat search and rescue unit that does not exist anywhere else in Europe. You can't just replace that capability.' The change in US presence comes as Britain's government is under pressure to retain 2per cent of its annual spending on defence. Independent defence analyst Howard Wheeldon said: 'The decision by the US is an object lesson for the UK government just as it is for those of our NATO allies that we must place a much greater emphasis on ensuring we have sufficient capability to defend ourselves.'","RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk is one of trio announced for closure today .

"A former medical student who murdered his roommate with poison and then tried to pass it off as an April Fool's joke gone wrong has lost his appeal against the death sentence. Lin Senhao, 28, a former master’s student at Shanghai Medical College, was convicted last February of the intentional homicide of Huang Yang, who was 27. Mr Huang died of multiple organ failure in April 2013 after swallowing a toxic chemical that Lin had placed inside a water cooler in their halls. Impassive: Lin Senhao stands for his appeal at the Shanghai Higher People's Court in Shanghai, where his death sentence for the lethal poisoning of his university room-mate was upheld . A post-mortem revealed that he had been poisoned with the toxic chemical N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). After Lin's death sentence was upheld today, his father was seen breaking down outside court. Surrounded by reporters and cameramen, he dropped to his knees and held his head in his hands. At his original trial in November 2013, Lin confessed to poisoning the water, but insisted he never intended to kill Mr Huang. The Global Times reported that prosecutors rejected Lin's argument, claiming he was familiar with the effects of the chemical he put in the water as he had used it in experiments on laboratory animals. 'The defendant Lin Senhao committed intentional homicide by poisoning due to trivialities. The method was ruthless, the harm to society was great, the crime extremely serious,' the court said in a statement. Prosecutors asserted that Lin killed Mr Huang because of a grudge he held over 'trivial daily matters'. Grief: Lin's father falls to his knees outside court after his son's death sentence was upheld on appeal . Lin's lawyers argued against any intention, claiming 'trivial daily matters' were not enough for Lin to commit the murder. In addition, they said he would have used a different chemical if it was his intention to kill due to NDMA's strong odour. Lin stated he was prompted to do the prank after Mr Huang announced his own plan to trick someone on April Fool's Day but added that he only wanted to cause Mr Huang some discomfort. Still, his understanding of NDMA was believed to be extensive after he published several articles with descriptions of experiments with the chemical in national academic journals, including measuring lethal volumes in mice. Lin put at least 30 grams - 10 times the fatal does for an adult man of Mr Huang's size - of the chemical in the water dispensers on March 31, 2013, at about 5.50pm. Prosecutors said Lin had taken the chemical from an experiment at the hospital on the same day. NDMA is primarily used for research and according to the US Environmental Protection Agency exposure in humans may cause liver damage and affect the blood. Homicide: A photo of murdered student Huang Yang on a fundraising collection box . After drinking the toxic water on April Fool's Day, Mr Huang was hospitalised. He was later transferred to intensive care with liver failure, plunging blood platelets and fever. Lin examined Mr Huang on the morning of April 2 and told him there was nothing wrong with his liver. Lin even visited Mr Huang in hospital. Mr Huang's condition was undiagnosed for eight days after drinking the chemical. Lin's other roommate, Ge Jungi, not a resident in the dorm at the time, remembered Lin had written articles about the chemical. When police found the chemical in the water dispenser and arrested Lin, he confessed. Police also found Lin had searched murder cases involving fatal doses on his laptop from April 1 to April 4. China's top court must review death sentences before execution can take place. The crime has been compared to a 1994 case that saw a student at Tsinghua University in Beijing allegedly poisoned with thallium, a toxic chemical used in rodent and insect poisons, by classmate Sun Wei while the two were studying chemistry. The victim, Zhu Ling, survived the poisoning but sustained severe brain damage. CNN reported that, at almost 40 years old, Zhu remains mostly bed-ridden, practically blind and with the mental capacity of a 6-year-old child. He was previously a keen swimmer and skilled musician. Despite being suspected of the poisoning, Sun was never tried and now lives abroad.","Lin Senhao, 28, was convicted of intentional homicide last February .

"It is one of the most enduring and baffling crime mysteries of modern times: The disappearance and murder of candy heiress Helen Brach. The horse-loving Helen, who inherited a multi-million dollar fortune from her husband, Frank, vanished in 1977, following a visit to a clinic in Minnesota, for a routine medical check up. No-one has ever been convicted in connection with her disappearance. But now recently revealed documents, and the claims of a former federal investigator, show that there is evidence and testimony that may finally solve the mystery. Brach, it is alleged in the documents, was kidnapped, beaten, shot and her body disposed of in a steel furnace, on the orders of a notorious Chicagoland horse dealer. Scroll down for video . Missing: Horse-loving Helen Brach, who inherited a multi-million dollar fortune from her husband, Frank, vanished in 1977, following a visit to a clinic in Minnesota, for a routine medical check up . Implicated: Richard Bailey was a well-known Chicago lothario who took up with the rich widow . How sweet it is : Brach's Confections was founded in 1904 by Emil J. Brach, the father of Helen's husband. He opened a candy store and factory in Chicago, the building used in the 2008 film The Dark Knight . Treats: The company's first product was caramels, but they are best known for their candy corn . The heiress, 65 when she disappeared and a dealer in horses herself, had stumbled into the dark underbelly of the trade, discovered major fraud and, it was feared by the plotters, was going to tell all. It was an insurance fraud, where highly-prized horses, many of them show jumpers, were killed for cash. A new book Who Killed the Candy Lady? by James Ylisela and published by Agate has brought together all the evidence – and sheds doubt on the involvement of the one man serving a prison sentence linked to the murder, Brach's lover, a sweet-talking conman called Richard Bailey. Bailey, now 85, is in a federal prison in Florida serving a 30-year sentence. He pleaded guilty to a federal racketeering charge, being part of an ongoing conspiracy to cheat elderly women out of their money. But, in an unusual sentencing hearing in 1995, the judge agreed to hear claims from prosecutors of his involvement in the murder of Helen Brach. And the judge agreed, on the preponderance of evidence rather than beyond reasonable doubt, that Bailey was involved in her disappearance and murder. On that basis, the judge handed down the 30 year sentence, 20 for his alleged involvement in Brach's murder. Brach's disappearance nearly three decades ago continues to fascinate. The former hat check girl from Ohio, a beauty in her youth, was 38 when she met and married then 60-year-old Frank Brach, who died in 1971. Founded in Chicago in 1904 by Frank's father, Emile J., the brand was arguably best known through its jingle 'Stop where you are, buy a Brach's candy bar'. Following the death of her husband, and living alone in her home on the north shore of Chicago, Brach began to get involved in selling and buying horses. And this was how she stumbled into a world of deeply unsavory characters involved in fraud, implicated in murder and with links to the Chicago Mob. It was also how she met the smooth- talking conman named Richard Bailey. Ylisela, a Chicago-based author, has been following the story for some 15 years, driven by the belief that Richard Bailey had nothing to do with the disappearance, or murder, of Brach. 'The reason I was fascinated is because it's a story with everything,' Ylisela said. 'It's got bad guys, commen, gigolos, horse thieves, an heiress, money and murder. This makes it a complicated story because there are so many characters, You could not make them up.' Ylisela writes: 'Richard Bailey is an interesting character, a born conman.' When he met the widow Brach in the mid 70s, he was already middle-aged and quite the lothario. 'He has a particular quality that things will always be better around the corner. He was friendliest, brightest inmate I have ever interviewed.' Ylisela has interviewed Bailey in prison a number of times over the past 15 years. 'He's not a good guy but one thing I do not think he is, is a murderer.' Ylisela believes, based on the recently revealed documents obtained by the author and interviews with a former federal investigator, that Brach became a victim of a sinister 'horse mafia' that operated for decades in the Chicagoland area. For much of that time it was led by an individual named Silas Jayne, the head of a family of horse dealers. Jayne, who died in the mid 1980s, was implicated in a series of murders, and convicted of conspiracy to murder his own brother. Jayne is a central figure in the files detailing what two senior investigators, John Rutonno, recently retired from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and John O'Connell, of the Cook County state's attorney's office, believe happened. The files were produced following an investigation carried out ten years ago after an individual named Joseph Plemmons came forward with claims he knew exactly how Brach was killed and her body disposed of. Horsing around: All fingers point to Silas Jayne as the man who was responsible for Brach's disappearance and death, says the author. His motive: Helen had discovered his insurance fraud scheme . Guilty? Helen's houseman Jack Matlick, appeared at a probate hearing in 1984 to determine if Brach should be declared legally dead. But he was implicated in Brach's disappearance by an eyewitness . Plemmons, who alleged he was part of the gang that kidnapped and killed Brach, implicates Jayne, claiming the notorious horse dealer ordered Brach's murder from his prison cell, where he was serving time for conspiracy to murder his brother, . Plemmons named names of those involved in the plot, a motley, and pretty nasty, crew including Brach's long time house man Jack Matlick, long a prime suspect in her disappearance. Plemmons is still alive and living in Florida. Two others, Frank Jr, and Lee Reiter, the police officer, are also still living. Neither of the two would speak to the author. Plemmons tale, and the painstaking efforts of investigators to independently verify his claims, is laid out in gruesome detail in the files produced by the investigation but only recently revealed. Brach was targeted after she threatened to reveal to authorities details of a major fraud involving horses orchestrated by Silas Jayne. Horses were bought and insured, then killed for the insurance money. The elderly heiress was beaten, shot point blank and her body disposed of in a blast furnace in an Indiana steel plant, according to Plemmons. Crucially, Ylisela argues, Bailey is not implicated in the gruesome plot. His name does not appear in the files, . But following the investigation, no further action was taken by prosecutors. Target: Helen got involved in the horse trade and came across a scheme run by mobsters where horses were bought, insured and then killed for the insurance money . Innocent: The author has been following the case for some 15 years, driven by the belief that Richard Bailey had nothing to do with the disappearance, or murder, of Brach . The home where Helen Brach lived in Chicago . Rutonno, the former ATF agent deeply frustrated at the failure to pursue the prosecution following Plemmons' 2005 revelations, said there was still a chance, probably the last, to solve this great crime mystery. Rutonno told Ylisela: 'There is no secret to the Brach case. We know how, we know why and we know where. I'll go to my grave knowing that we had it done.' Ylisela believes Bailey was the victim of a system and federal prosecutors who wanted the crime solved. He believes that Bailey should be released from the Coleman federal correction institution, not least because of his age. 'He long ago served his 10 years for fraud. The extra time was a sentence for the Brach murder. But he's served enough even on that. The fact is they were wrong to add that time.' Ylisela believes if Bailey knew anything of the murder he would long ago have revealed everything. 'Even if somewhat damaging to him, he would have played that card a long time ago and blamed anybody if he could have.' Ylisela added: 'Bailey is not the hero by any stretch but the Feds wanted to solve this case and going after Bailey was the only way to do that.'

"This is the moment a Gary Barlow tribute act got down on one knee to propose in the middle of a performance. Dan Maines, 32, was half way through singing Take That hit 'A Million Love Songs' when he stepped off the stage and pulled out a ring for girlfriend Vicki Gaiger at a New Year's Eve gig in Wales. The 25-year-old waitress said yes before she burst into tears and fell into his arms as the crowd of fans clapped and cheered. Dan Maines, 32, a Gary Barlow tribute act, was midway through singing when he got down on one knee . He was performing at a New Year's Eve gig in Wales when he asked girlfriend Vicki Gaiger, 25, to marry him . Miss Gaiger, from Herne Bay in Kent, said: 'We'd had a little set-to on the way to Wales  as Dan got us lost, so I thought he was just trying to apologise. 'I had no idea what was happening when he proposed.'I was already pretty overwhelmed by the dedication with the song, so it was definitely a shock.' The couple originally met at one of his gigs where he was performing with Take That tribute act, Rule the World, in March last year where they performed in Miss Gaiger's home town. She added: 'I found out he lived 328 miles away in Cleckheaton in West Yorkshire. The couple had met at one of his gigs a year ago, where he performed with band mates from Rule The World . The moment was captured on tape as Miss Gaiger looked shocked before saying 'yes' and bursting into tears . The couple are now hopeful that the real Gary Barlow might perform at their wedding after he announced he would perform at three receptions this year . 'It wasn't ideal, but it didn't stop us. We chatted and Facetimed each other for a few weeks, then Dan came down for a ""date weekend"" and hasn't left since. Mr Maines said: 'I knew the moment I met Vicki that I would marry her, it was just a case of picking the right time. Vicki Gaiger, left, and Dan Maines, right, are now celebrating their engagement in the Canary Islands . 'We wanted to be living together for a year before we got engaged but I felt it would have been less of a surprise if I waited the full 12 months. 'I felt there was nothing more perfect than having the chance to see in the New Year with the woman I love as my fiance.' Mr Maines has been performing on stage for a decade and, along with his bandmates, he recently met Take That on the Graham Norton Show. He added: 'I've been gigging for 10 years and performed in some of the most prestigious venues in the world. 'But I have to say that I have never come close to feeling as nervous as I did on New Year's Eve. 'I'm a very lucky man and very proud and privileged to call Vicki my fiance.' The couple flew to the Canary Islands this week to celebrate their engagement and now hope the real Gary Barlow will take to the stage at their wedding. A hopeful Miss Gaiger said: 'Everyone's tweeting him to get him to sing at our wedding.

"As freezing cold weather sweeps most of the country, many Americans are cranking up their thermostats and trying  to avoid any time outside in the frostbite-inducing temperatures. Not Laurens de Jong. The Detroit resident has been driving his convertible with the top down every day for 12 years running, no matter the weather.

Brrr: Laurens de Jong has been riding his convertible with the top down for the past 12 years . Hasn't stopped: 46-year-old de Jong, originally from the Netherlands, started the habit in September 2003, when he challenged himself to keep the top down for 100 days straight . 'I love how unbelievably pure the air is when it's cold,' he told the Detroit News. 'I love the padded sound of tires on fresh snow.' However, he does pridefully keep track of how many days in a row he has kept the top down, using a little metal counter stashed in his blue 2005 Honda S2000. As of Wednesday, that number was 2,809 days. De Jong admits he's not superhuman. He does get cold on the commute, especially in the winter. Thursdays's temperatures around rush hour, for example, were just 9 degrees with fast-accumulating snow. Snow, though, is not as much a problem for de Jong as rain - which has short-circuited his electrical system before. He says the only time he rolls the top up is if a passenger in the car asks or if there's a downpour. Morning rush: Detroit residents often take pictures of de Jong out and about in unusual weather. His commute to his IT job in downtown Detroit takes about 50 minutes each way . Exceptions: De Jong says he only ever puts the top up if he has a passenger in the car who feel uncomfortable, or when it's downpour raining . Paying it foward: De Jong has started advertising a non-profit called THAW on the side of his car. The charity helps Michigan families in need pay their utility bills . However, he says he's mostly been able to avoid getting soaked by scanning radar for breaks in the rain. De Jong has become somewhat of a celebrity in Detroit, where he works downtown as a IT supervisor. Befuddled drivers on the road often take pictures of him driving around town in unusual weather. De Jong says he gets a mixture of reactions - and not all of them positive. One time, a man road up alongside him and said: 'You're lucky I don't have my gun with me!' The majority of comments though, are from curious drivers asking if he's cold. While de Jong isn't a big fan of people taking pictures of him on the road, he has accepted it as a reality of his lifestyle choice and embraced it by promoting a charity on the side of his car. A sticker on both doors advertises the non-profit THAW, a charity which helps Michigan families in need pay their utility bills. No one at the organization knew de Jong or that he was promoting their work, but the CEO said it was 'very cool' that he was going cold so that others wouldn't have to.","Laurens de Jong of Detroit has been riding this way for the past 12 years, after challenging himself to keep the top down for 100 days straight .

"California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer of California said Thursday in a YouTube video that she won't run for re-election in 2016, sparking immediate discussions about an arms race among Golden State liberals to succeed her. A fearless backer of abortion rights, gun control and environmental regulation, Boxer boasted that 'I have about a thousand accomplishments' First elected to Congress in 1983 and sent to the Senate ten years later, the 74-year-old Boxer told supporters in the brief video that she doesn't feel old. 'I feel as young as I did when I got elected,' Boxer claimed. But she would have been 82 if she had won and completed a fifth consecutive Senate term. Scroll down for video . Sen. Barbara Boxer said in a YouTube video filmed with her grandson (foreground) that she's not planning to run for re-election next year . 'WHAT?' House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was shocked to learn from a reporter that her fellow California liberal lioness was calling it quits . 'I am never going to retire. The work is too important. But I will not be running for the Senate in 2016,' Boxer said. She has said previously that she is proudest of the vote she cast against the war in Iraq during the George W. Bush presidency. Leading Democrats now expected to contend for her seat include Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, Attorney General Kamala Harris and Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg has also been long-rumored as eyeing the seat. Sandberg was chief of staff to Treasury Sec. Larry Summers when Bill Clinton was president, and could fund her own U.S. Senate race without missing the money. With Boxer out of the race, at least, Hillary Clinton would be free of the angst-inducing endorsement choice between her old political ally and one of her husband's former advisers. The renewed energy surrounding a hotly contested Senate primary could create problems for Democrats, however. In California's 'jungle primary' system, the top two vote-getters advance to a runoff in the general election regardless of their party. While that could mean an expensive and divisive two-Democrat slug fest in November 2016, it could also present an opportunity for Republican challengers if too many liberals enter the race and find their votes split. NOT RUNNING: 2010 Republican Senate candidate Carly Fiorina said through a spokeswoman that she has no intention of making a second bid for Boxer's U.S. Senate seat . GOP candidates could wind up in both of the top slots if only two ran and a more fractured Democratic field included five or more hopefuls. Boxer is best known in California as an environmentalist warrior, writing and passing laws that reclassified more than 1 million acres of land there as 'wilderness,' a designation that bans motor vehicles, new roads and all mining. She also led efforts to prevent oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. But her most memorable moment on Capitol Hill was a momentary gender-politics flare-up involving U.S. Army General Michael Walsh – who called her 'ma'am' during a 2009 Senate hearing. 'Do me a favor,' she interrupted. 'Can you say ""senator"" instead of ""ma'am""?' 'It’s just a thing. I worked so hard to get that title, so I’d appreciate it. Thank you.' Gen. Walsh quickly obliged – 'Yes, senator.' In the military, regulations require addressing superiors – including members of Congress – as 'ma'am' or 'sir.' But among feminists the term 'ma'am' it can be seen as demeaning or patronizing. Elaine Donnelly, president of the Center for Military Readiness, told the Washington Times the following day that Boxer was 'embarrassing herself by showing hypersensitivity and insecurity that is unbecoming to a United States senator.' 'I've always been suspicious of women who are insulted by pronouns,' Donnelly jabbed. The episode became political grist during the 2010 election, when parody filmmaker David Zucker – of 'Airplane!' fame – made an online ad mocking her. Boxer is a liberal's liberal, advocating for decades in favor of abortion rights, environmental regulations and gun control . The 2-minute spot included everyone from Indian chiefs and nuns to Eagle scouts and surgeons insisting on being called by their proper titles. 'We've called her ""senator"" for 20 years,' the ad's voiceover intoned. 'It's time to call her ""ma'am"" again.' Boxer bested former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina by 10 points to win re-election. Fiorina spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores told DailyMail.com that she won't be running in California again. The one-time candidate has 'called Virginia home since 2011 to be near her grandkids,' Flores said. 'She and Frank also lived in virginia for 7 years in the 1980s.' FIorina is, however, scheduled to appear at the Iowa Freedom Summit on January 24, fueling rumors of presidential aspirations. People close to fIrebrand GOP Rep. Darrell Issa and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, both Californians, told reporters on Thursday that neither will run for the open Senate seat next year. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a fellow California Democrat, was visibly shocked on Thursday when a reporter asked her about Boxer's retirement during a regular weekly press briefing. The news had broken while Pelosi was at the podium taking questions. 'What?' she asked. CALL ME SENATOR: Boxer famously upbraided U.S. Army Brigadier Gen. Michael Walsh (right) in 2009 for calling her 'ma'am' during a Senate hearing, even though he meant it as a term of respect . Pelosi said the senator had phoned her office during the morning but she never took the call. 'She called, she wanted to talk to me personally. I thought she wanted to have dinner tonight,' Pelosi chuckled. She said Boxer's retirement 'will be a great loss to the United States, the people of California and, the country.' Boxer's popularity among Californians has been on a downward slide for the past few years. One September 2014 poll from the Public Policy Institute of California put her approval rating at just 41 per cent. Dianne Feinstein, California's senior senator, praised Boxer's 'hard work in support of women and families, the environment, human rights and her tireless efforts to modernize our country’s infrastructure.' 'She is never one to shy away from any challenge, and I can’t thank her enough for being such a resilient collaborator,' Sen. Feinstein said in a statement. 'We blazed many trails together, and now I’m eager to see where her next steps take her.'","Liberal icon dropped her retirement bombshell in a YouTube video with her grandson .

"Karl Wilson has been jailed for 16 years for running a heroin and crack cocaine trafficking ring which moved drugs from the Midlands to Scotland . A drugs baron who ran a multi-million pound smuggling ring by hiding heroin and cocaine in Asda coffee tins has been jailed for 16 years. Karl Wilson, 58, lived in a £400,000 villa in Jamaica after fleeing Britain when his Class A drugs ring was smashed in 2008. After being extradited back to Britain last year, he admitted money laundering and conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine and was jailed yesterday. Wilson and his gang trafficked heroin and cocaine from Wolverhampton, West Midlands, to Aberdeen in north-east Scotland. They smuggled the drugs in tins of Asda coffee, soaked in vinegar to put sniffer dogs off their scent. Wilson, whose nickname was 'Mafia' in the underworld, first went to Aberdeen from Wolverhampton to sell drugs with his associate Melanie Clarke in 2002. It is believed the pair saw an increase in trade in December that year when other drug dealers went away for Christmas. They then took £40,000 in cash back to Wolverhampton to buy more drugs and Wilson's gang started shipping one or two kilo loads of heroin to Aberdeen twice a week. The drugs were then smuggled to Scotland in the spare tyre of hire cars with Wilson often travelling in a car an hour behind the courier. At the height of the operation, they took just four days to sell a kilo of heroin. Police found £50,000 worth of drugs in some of the tins when they arrested two of the gang members. In November 2004, officers found Wilson at a house in Wolverhampton with £322 in Scottish notes and the keys to a Mercedes where they found a bag containing £6,990 in cash. His associate Clarke spent most of 2005 in prison after being jailed for drug dealing but then returned to the West Midlands and linked up with Wilson again. Police continued to secretly monitor their operations with vehicle tracker devices and mobile phone checks but Wilson fled to Jamaica before he could be arrested in December 2008. He continued to direct the drug running operation from his luxury £400,000 villa in Bulls Bay, Luceau - one of Jamaica's tourist hotspots - until other key gang members were arrested in February 2009. Wilson fled to Jamaica after some of his gang's drugs were seized and lived in this £400,000 villa in the tourist hotspot of Bulls Bay, Luceau . Speaking at her trial in 2010, Clarke said: 'Karl was in control and everybody had to abide by him. He said what took place and you had to follow what he said. 'We made a lot of money then (in December 2002) because a lot of the other dealers had gone home over the festive period.' Clarke, who was released from prison in 2012 after serving half her sentence of four years and two months, died in a house fire 12 months ago aged 34. Wilson, who holds dual British and Jamaican citizenship, originally came to the UK in his late teens and set up home in the West Midlands. He worked as a panel beater   before turning to pimping and then becoming a drug dealer. Eight of his gang members were sentenced to a total of more than 30 years in jail in 2010 and 2011 as part of a long running investigation named Operation Sorcerer. British police began extradition proceedings in March 2011 and the drugs baron was arrested by Jamaican authorities almost two years later in February 2013. He was then returned to the UK on June 17 last year to face charges of conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine and four counts of money laundering between 2000 and 2009. Wilson, previously of Tettenhall, West Midlands, pleaded guilty to the charges at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Monday and was jailed for 16 years yesterday. The gang initially avoided detection by hiding the drugs in coffee cans soaked in vinegar to hide the smell . Judge Martin Walsh told drug kingpin Karl Wilson: 'An orchestrated chain of supply existed between the West Midlands and Aberdeen. 'The exact volume involved is impossible to calculate but was clearly substantial. You were the organiser and controller. 'You played a leading part in the recruiting of others and were unquestionably involved in the buying and selling in the expectation of substantial gain. By 2004 many thousands of pounds were being made. 'The commercial dealing of drugs destroys the lives of individuals and blights the communities in which they live which is why those who supply the drugs can expect to receive substantial sentences. You were the lead player in this conspiracy.' Mark Heywood QC, defending, said the drugs baron - who fought a four-year battle against extradition - was 'broken' by his crimes. He added: 'He knows he has ruined his own life and helped to ruin the lives of many others. His pleas of guilty were entered because he has given up. He is broken.' Speaking after the hearing, Detective Chief Inspector Martin Brennan, of West Midlands Police, said: 'This was an organised group of individuals who had a very slick operation to distribute drugs in Aberdeen but it was not slick enough to avoid detection by police. 'The message from court is a clear one - all drugs offences of this nature will be investigated thoroughly and the punishment can be very severe for offenders.' Following the sentencing, police are now looking at confiscating Wilson's assets.","Gang hid drugs in  coffee tins soaked in vinegar to avoid detection .

"Thousands of academy schools are ‘not helping our kids’ and could be forced back under council control by Labour, Ed Miliband warned yesterday. The Labour leader hit out at the ‘alphabet soup’ of school structures, including academies, which were championed by Tony Blair, and free schools, which were introduced by the Coalition. In comments that appeared to go much further than Labour’s official policy, Mr Miliband suggested all schools should be placed back under local bureaucrats. Mr Miliband’s comments came during a question and answer session with local people in Hucknall, near Nottingham - the first in a series of ‘People’s Question Time’ events the Labour leader is planning in the run-up to the election. Mr Miliband said: 'You have got to have proper local accountability. You cannot run thousands of schools from Whitehall' during a question and answer session  in Hucknall near Nottingham . Responding to a question from a representative of the National Union of Teachers, Mr Miliband said: ‘The alphabet soup of different kinds of schools - free schools, academies, trust schools and all that - is not helping our kids. ‘You have got to have proper local accountability. You cannot run thousands of schools from Whitehall - Michael Gove has certainly proved that. You can’t run all these schools from central government.’ Mr Miliband then posed for pictures with NUT rep Laura Hastie, a primary school teacher, while holding a copy of the militant union’s education ‘manifesto’. The document calls for all state-funded schools to be put back under the control of local councils. It also calls for an end to free schools, and urges a cap on teachers’ working hours, as well as making numerous demands for more funding. Self-governance is a key feature of academy and free schools, which supporters say gives them the freedom to innovate and drive through improvements without council interference or bureaucracy. Labour’s Blairite shadow education secretary, Tristram Hunt, has adopted a much more positive approach to academies than his leader. Mr Hunt has said Labour would not approve any more free schools, but would introduce a new class of ‘parent-led academies’ - potentially adding to the ‘alphabet soup’ attacked by Mr Miliband yesterday. Mr Hunt has also proposed the introduction of local ‘directors of standards’ to keep tabs on academy and free schools and encourage greater co-operation. But he has not suggested they should be placed fully back under local authority control. A Conservative spokesman last night said Mr Miliband’s comments left Labour’s education policy in ‘complete chaos’. He added: ‘They have no plan to raise standards in our schools. In fact, we now know that Ed Miliband wants to turn the clock back and undo everything that has been achieved under this government. ‘As a result of our plan for education and the success of our free schools and academies programme, a million more children are being taught in good and outstanding schools, 100,000 more six year-olds are on course to become confident readers and parents have more choice than ever before. 'Labour would put all of this progress at risk because they are driven by the interests of the unions rather than those of pupils and parents.’ Michael Gove (pictured at Durand Academy in Stockwell, south London in 2011 when he was Education Secretary) has certainly proven that schools 'cannot' be run 'from central government', according to Mr Miliband . A Labour source yesterday said there was no change of policy and said Mr Miliband was simply re-stating his position. In a separate development, Mr Miliband said Labour plans to offer a pay boost to thousands of workers providing care to the elderly. ‘When we are talking about one of the most important jobs in our society, it is also one of the worst-paid jobs in our society - that is looking after elderly people.’ We are going to have more to say about this in the coming weeks - about how we can do more for those people doing that really important job of looking after elderly people. A Labour source confirmed the party is examining ways to boost the pay of care workers, but was unable to provide details of what the new policy would mean. The party has previously criticised the practice of offering 15-minute care appointments in people’s homes, where carers are often not paid for the time spent travelling between appointments. ‘These people do an important job and don’t get a fair deal. We are going to do something about that,’ a source said.","The Labour leader attacked the ‘alphabet soup’ of school structures .

"The BBC has been criticised for airing an episode of Silent Witness in which a sniper killed eight people including a police officer on the same day 12 people were shot dead in a terror attack in France. Last night's episode of the BBC One drama concluded with eight people being shot, including a female detective, and aired just hours after news of the targeted attack on Charlie Hebdo broke. Some fans were angry, with some condemning the licence-funded corporation for airing the violent episode in the wake of the tragic attack which saw two gunmen storm the Paris offices of the French newspaper. Scroll down for video . Last night's episode of BBC One's Silent Witness (above) featured eight people being shot, including a female detective, and aired just hours after the horrific terror attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris, France . The Silent Witness episode was aired on the same day 12 people were gunned down in Paris, France, in a terror attack. Two gunmen (pictured) stormed the offices of French newspaper Charlie Hebdo and opened fire . Several viewers took to Twitter last night to express shock and disappointed at the BBC for airing the episode . It was the second episode of Silent Witness to air this week, with the first part of the BBC drama – which aired on Tuesday - showing a gunman kill three people at a petrol station. Today, it emerged that anti-terror police in France had swooped on a petrol station in the northern part of the country after two men 'armed with Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers' stormed the garage and robbed it. While that episode aired before the events in Paris yesterday unfolded, viewers took to Twitter last night to suggest the BBC was wrong for showing the second part – called 'Sniper's Nest' - and claimed it should have been postponed. Twelve people – including two police officers - were gunned down in Paris yesterday after two armed gunmen stormed the offices of Charlie Hebdo - the notoriously anti-Islamist satirical newspaper. Using the #jesuischarlie hashtag – which was trending around the world on Twitter last night carrying messages of support and solidarity with the French victims – people blasted the BBC for showing the drama. Dolly Belle said: 'Whoever at the @BBCOne who gave the green light for a gunman-themed episode of #SilentWitness was very misguided. #jesuischarlie (sic)' Sally-Ann Burgon said: 'V disappointed in @BBCOne for choosing to show #SilentWitness tonight in light of today's events #ParisShooting #CharlieHebdo #JeSuisCharlie.' Many viewers condemned the licence-funded corporation for airing the episode in the wake of the Paris terror attack, branding it 'insensitive' and 'misguided'. Others said they refused to watch the show out of respect . Mark Smith added: 'Really think @BBC should have pulled #SilentWitness because of #ParisShooting #JeSuisCharlie.' Another Twitter user, writing under the name Angela, said: 'Somewhat surprised @BBCOne screening #SilentWitness tonight; #JeSuisCharlie.' And Geoff Betteridge said: 'Why are BBC running Silent Witness? Very insensitive.' Meanwhile, others refused to watch the BBC drama – which attracts about six million viewers – out of respect for the Paris victims. John Ashton wrote: 'Won't be watching part 2 of #silentwitness tonight. Doesn't seem appropriate somehow. #JeSuisCharlie' The BBC confirmed to MailOnline it had received at least 10 complaints over the content of last night's episode but said: 'The background and storyline in Silent Witness was very different to the tragic events in France'. Those who sent messages to the BBC's Twitter account last night didn't receive a reply.

The officer, who has not yet been named, died after being attacked just before dawn in Montrouge, a suburb in the south of the French capital. This afternoon, armed anti-terror police swooped on a wooded area in northern France following reports of sightings of the two suspects – brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi - of the Charlie Hebdo massacre.","Fans hit out at BBC for screening Silent Witness episode after Paris attack .

With a 60-minute appointment at Oro Gold costing £256 or a bulk purchase of six coming in at £1,200, having the clinic's maximum of 12 treatments per month could cost £28,800 a year . In the first episode of The Super-Rich And Us, broadcast last night, presenter Jacques Peretti visited a branch of the Oro Gold beauty clinic in London and was given a treatment where a mask containing real gold flakes was laid over his face. Oro Gold puts 24-carat flakes in all of its products. A beauty therapist told the programme that clients can have up to 12 treatments a month.

It claims it will ‘give your skin a boost of vitamins, minerals and long lost vital ingredients to help you look and feel radiant’. Other products include a ‘24K Cryogenic Diamond Mask’, selling for £1,000 a pot and with ingredients including diamond dust, which it claims will ‘add shine and gently moisturise while reducing the appearance of wrinkles’. Skin experts say that these luxurious products have 'no conceivable medical benefit'. Beauty therapist Lisa Harris said: 'It's impossible for gold to penetrate the skin, it's the other ingredients which are good for the skin' But Dr Adam Friedmann, a consultant dermatologist at the Harley Street Dermatology Clinic, said: ‘It sounds like a good way of spending money for nothing. The reality is that gold and diamonds are completely unreactive, so the benefit of using gold and diamonds over other things is pretty much zero. ‘It just sounds like a clever bit of gimmickry with no conceivable medical benefit.’ Beauty therapist Lisa Harris said: ‘It’s impossible for gold to penetrate the skin, it’s the other ingredients which are good for the skin. Diamonds won’t penetrate either, again it’s the other ingredients.’ Oro Gold said last night: ‘Gold and diamonds are being rediscovered today in modern skin care and their inclusion can be found in the world’s most luxurious brands.’ Oro Gold said its products will moisturise, rejuvenate and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.

"The Australian health department is paying for its staff to undergo unproven methods to help them quit their smoking habits as part of its Smoke Free Workplace policy. These include remedies such as hypnotherapy and acupuncture which have been offered to public servants who are trying to give up cigarettes, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. According to a health department spokeswoman, in the last financial year the government paid two workers a total of $1000 for hypnotherapy. The Australian health department is paying for its staff to undergo unproven methods of quitting smoking habits as part of its Smoke Free Workplace policy . Since 2010, the department has examined applications for 'reasonable reimbursement of a range of activities to help employees quit smoking' a spokeswoman told the Herald. The revelation comes after a question on notice was submitted by Labor senator Joe Ludwig. Hypnotherapy is one of the many methods used to help smokers quit their habits by placing suggestions in the subject's unconscious mind, according to Tobacco in Australia - a review compiled by the Cancer Council Victoria and funded by the department. This weakens the desire to smoke, or strengthen their will to stop, or improve their ability to carry through a treatment program. 'The effectiveness of hypnosis has been poorly studied, with studies producing conflicting results,' the review states. 'It has not been shown that hypnotherapy itself increases long-term quitting rates, although counselling or other treatments that accompany it can be helpful to some smokers. 'To date, there is no clear evidence to support the use of hypnotherapy, acupuncture or related treatments in their own right as quitting aids.' However the funding for such therapies has been met with criticism from health experts. Professor in public health at the University of Sydney, Simon Chapman, told the Sydney Morning Herald the department is 'just throwing money away and those procedures are often quite expensive'. Mike Daube, a health policy professor at Curtin University in Perth, also told the Herald that the department should 'stick with what we know to be most effective'. He suggests that staff should be urged to try giving up smoking cold turkey, go to their doctor for advice or opt for proven methods such as nicotine replacements.","Health department reimbursed two staff members a total of $1000 for hypnotherapy .

"It is the smallest county in mainland England. But house prices in the rural, rolling hills of Rutland are rising faster than almost anywhere else in the country, and are even out-performing Greater London. Figures show that homes grew in value by 19 per cent last year, quicker than in the capital where they rose by 18 per cent. Rutland is the smallest county in mainland England (Buttercross Market square in the county pictured). However, house prices are rising faster here than almost anywhere else in the country - and last year, homes grew in value by 19 per cent . The average property in the picturesque East Midlands county shot up by almost £50,000 in 12 months to reach £305,000. This compares to the average in England and Wales of £279,000, figures show. Data collated by  LSL Property Services, owner of the country’s largest chain of lettings agents, found that Slough was the strongest performing unitary council or county with 21 per cent growth. This was followed by Rutland, Southend-on-Sea, Windsor and Maidenhead, Hertfordshire and Medway.

There are also several prestigious independent schools in the county, including Uppingham, where alumni include actor Stephen Fry, property presenter Phil Spencer and chef Rick Stein. The ancient county was abolished as a county in 1974 when it became part of Leicestershire, but reinstated after a 23-year campaign. Victory was declared in 1997 when it was allowed to be governed by its own council and it became the smallest unitary authority in England. In 2007, Royal Mail officially recognised Rutland as a postal county again. Yesterday, Cheryl Farrow, of Murray Estate Agents in Oakham, said: ‘Rutland is a very quaint county with pretty villages and town, a nature reserve and great schools. ‘We do get a lot of people from the south moving here and either commuting to London or retiring here. ‘There are fast train links from nearby Grantham and Peterborough, but it is a quiet county with small high streets and independent retailers. ‘The older properties are good-looking houses and highly sought-after so, when one does come on the market, they sell very well and for a premium.’ It is the tiniest county in the country, except at high tide when the Isle of Wight temporarily takes this crown. Rutland Water is the UK’s largest man-made lake, similar size to Windermere in the Lake District. It has previously been reported to have the highest fertility rate and life expectancy in the country. Rutland is the only county not to have a ‘McDonalds’ fast food chain.

"A 28-year-old mother-of-four who claims to be the 'Queen of Frugal' is determined to show people they don't need to spend big to enjoy life. Jordan Page from Draper, Utah, was plunged into financial hardship after a housing project she was working on with her unemployed entrepreneurial husband, Bubba, fell through. With $15,000 in credit card debt and little income, Jordan forced herself to cut back on everything - stocking up on coupons, cheap make-up and even taking leftovers from neighbors. Scroll down for video . Queen of Frugal: Jordan Page from Draper, Utah,  is determined to show people they don't need to spend big to enjoy life . Now, three-and-a-half years later, the stay-at-home mother has cleared her dues and has started speaking out about her penny-pinching antics  in a bid to help others. In one of her YouTube videos, Jordan shows how to apply fake eyelashes and curl hair instead of going to a pricey salon. She also notes that her secret weapon to looking good is an eyebrow pencil which she picked up for just 99 cents at a drugstore. 'I'm a busy mom, I don't have time for complicated makeup! This is my NO-FAIL routine that I use every day...and it uses mostly drugstore products!' she tells viewers. On the food front, she says she waters down expensive fruit juice to make it last longer.

'My family has never noticed . . . it's pretty strong anyway,' Jordan says. On her blog, Fun Cheap or Free, Jordan says it's essential to make financial plans for the year ahead. For 2015, she recommends plotting out birthdays and anniversaries to save for presents in advance. She also notes the importance of thinking about vacations so that friends might be contacted for free accommodation and cheaper flights can be sourced. Despite their improved finances, Jordan and her husband - who currently runs a tech start-up - continue their frugal lifestyle. They have a giant haul of free and bargain items in their $1 million house - which they claim as their biggest bargain after buying it for a cut-price $400,000. In an effort to further reduce the house price they even sold the basement to Jordan's parents to use as a holiday home. Jordan now plans to write about her thriftiness after signing a book deal. Portion control: Jordan prepares some snacks for her brood . Bulk buying: Food shopping must be difficult for Jordan as a wife and mother-of-four . She said: 'Being frugal is not about giving up everything you love but learning to get everything you love the smart way. 'We cut back on our spending but by being so extremely frugal we didn't have to lose out on much in life. 'We found ways to eat out for free or cheap, enjoyed discounted movies, free events, we won contests and got free stuff, we learned we could live on very little. 'I love proving my sprawling fashionable wardrobe, the good food we eat, the beautiful home we live in and fun things we do as a family are because of how frugal we are, not in spite of it.' Jordan, who appeared on TLC's Extreme Cheapskates last year, admits she has always been frugal - thanks to her mother who taught her to get excited about finding a deal.

She added: 'Buying something on sale, the joy of finding second-hand items and stretching money - mum taught me everything. 'I was considered the cheap one of my friends in college because I'd pack food rather than buy lunch every day. 'But it wasn't until our financial disaster I learned what it really meant to be frugal.' Jordan acknowledges many people turn their noses up at her perceived 'cheap' methods of living. But she is able to enjoy everything other people do albeit with a slight twist. She said: 'The greatest compliment is when I go to a business event or a blogging conference and people ask if I'm a fashion blogger.

"Striking differences have been found between our galaxy, the Milky Way, and its near-twin neighbour, Andromeda. Both are spiral collections of stars with similar structures and look almost identical, despite Andromeda being about twice as large as the Milky Way. But appearances can be deceptive. A new study into the motion of stars has found Andromeda has a history of violence, in contrast to the relatively peaceful Milky Way. A new study into the motion of stars has found Andromeda (left) has a history of violence, in contrast to the relatively peaceful Milky Way (artists's impression right) Andromeda's stars are more disordered than those of our galaxy, probably as a result of clashes and mergers with smaller galaxies. Such violent histories are thought to be common for large spiral galaxies, with 70 per cent experiencing at least one interaction in the last 10,000 years. The apparent orderliness of the Milky Way marks it out as unusual. Professor Puragra Guhathakurta, from the University of California at Santa Cruz, who led the research using observation data from the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, said: 'In this context, the motion of the stars in Andromeda's disk is more normal, and the Milky Way may simply be an outlier with an unusually quiescent accretion history.' Click on the image to zoom in on Andromeda . Although 'neighbours' the Milky Way and Andromeda are separated by a distance of 2.5 million light years. The two are the largest members of the Local Group, a collection of 30 galaxies. The scientists found that the youngest stars in Andromeda moved in a relatively ordered way around its centre while older stars displayed much more disordered motion. Previous studies have found evidence of galactic mergers in tidal streams of stars in Andromeda's extended halo. They appear to be the remnants of cannibalised dwarf galaxies. It’s widely accepted than in five billion years our Milky Way will collide with the nearby Andromeda galaxy - but what will happen when it does? In a new simulation revealed in September, scientists showed the intricate process that will take place, with the two central supermassive black holes merging into one. And the newly formed super-galaxy, dubbed ‘Milkomeda’, will also ultimately spell disaster for Earth as our planet is flung out into interstellar space. The simulation was created by a number of institutions led by the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (Icrar) in Western Australia. In the simulation it can be seen how the two galaxies will interact as they approach each other. First, in a tentative meeting, they will ‘swoop’ past each other, possibly disrupting some of the orbits of stars in the arms of each spiral galaxy. Then, after separating, the two galaxies will accelerate towards each other again. As Andromeda is larger than the Milky Way, with one trillion stars in the former compared to about 300 billion in the latter, it will technically be the one ‘eating’ our galaxy. The Milky Way is also expected to ‘eat’ two nearby dwarf galaxies, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, at some point in the future. The findings were presented at the winter meeting of the American Astronomical Association in Seattle . Earlier this week the sharpest and largest image ever taken of the Andromeda Galaxy - the nearest spiral galaxy to our Milky Way - has been revealed by astronomers. It shows more than 100 million stars and thousands of star clusters embedded in a section of the galaxy’s pancake-shaped disc stretching across over 40,000 light-years. The sweeping view, which reveals one third of our galactic neighbour, also suggests that the galaxy may have been battered by a collision with another galaxy two billion years ago. Benjamin Williams of the University of Washington in Seattle told Nature that the image hints at an older wave of starbirth that had previously only been spotted in one area of Andromeda. ‘No one would have guessed it was galaxy-wide’, he said, suggesting there may have been a major collision in the galaxy’s history.

Ataxia affects the central nervous system, causing problems with balance and coordination. It often affects movement in the fingers, hands, arms and legs. It can also cause sight and speech problems. Secondary complications, such as recurrent urinary tract infections and obstructive sleep apnea, can be life-threatening. Ataxia can be caused by damage to a part of the brain known as the cerebellum, the spinal cord or peripheral nerves. Some forms of the disease and conditions that trigger it are hereditary. Treatment depends on the cause and physical therapy might help in some cases. Molly's mother, Dawn Bricker, said the community's support for her daughter, who was diagnosed four years ago, was overwhelming. 'This is fabulous,' Bricker said.

"In the course of their murderous rampage yesterday in Paris, two of the Islamist shooters announced that they were acting in the name of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula or AQAP, the affiliate of Al Qaeda that operates in Yemen. Formed in 2009, AQAP merged existing Yemeni and Saudi jihadists after the Saudi Kingdom became too unsafe for them and they fled southwards. This suggests that AQAP feels eclipsed by ISIS, which has attracted so much coverage since last summer, and is determined to put itself back in the international spotlight with this act of mass murder, in broad daylight, in a major European capital. There is a proven link between AQAP and the gunmen's choice of target since AQAP's online magazine 'Inspire' recently included the editor-in-chief of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in a list of 'unbelievers' deserving a bullet. AQAP also has a track record of mounting attacks on western targets, and has its own Foreign Operations Unit to train terrorists who can convincingly pass themselves off in foreign contexts. Scroll down for video . The two men were named as Cherif Kouachi (left), 32, and his brother Said Kouachi (right), 34 . There is a direct personal link between AQAP and core Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Its leader, Nasir Abdel Karim al- Wuhayshi, served four years as Osama bin Laden's aide de camp and then became Ayman al-Zawahiri's 'general manager' thereafter. After three years in a Yemeni jail, in 2006 Wuhayshi escaped and has led AQAP ever since. Attacks on the 'far enemy' as they call the West, are integral to Al Qaeda's strategy, since it undermines western support for the local regimes Al Qaeda wishes to destroy. Like Afghanistan under the Taliban, Yemen is almost ideally suited for terrorist groups to operate. It is a wild place, with vast and rugged desert wastelands, including the Hadramaut region in the north east where the family of Osama bin Laden originated from before they emigrated to Saudi Arabia. Yemen is the poorest Arab state, not least because its modest oil reserves are almost totally exhausted. So too is the country's water supply, with so much of it diverted into growing the leaf narcotic qat which Yemeni men chew obsessively throughout the afternoons. The capital, Sana'a will soon be the first city in the world to run out of water as the aquifers empty. The politics of Yemen are desperate too, with government compared with dancing on the heads of snakes. Its long time dictator, President Ali Abdullah Saleh, was ousted in February 2012, leaving what amounts to a power vacuum. The country was already faced with two secessionist insurgencies in north and south. One of these involves the Iranian-backed Houthis, who come from the country's large Shia minority in a country that is predominantly Sunni. The Sunnis are backed by Saudi Arabia which is so worried by its disturbed southern neighbor as to construct a huge fence along the heavily patrolled border. This has not checked the Houthi advance. Recently, the triumphal Houthis virtually hijacked the weak government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi and took control the capital. The Shia Houthis are waging a violent struggle against the Sunni AQAP, with almost daily bomb attacks, like the one which on Wednesday killed 38 would-be recruits at Sana'a's police training academy. Drive by shootings of intelligence and police officers by AQAP gunmen are also becoming more frequent. 'Massacre': Two masked gunmen brandishing Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers attack the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo office . Helpless: The gunmen move in on the officer as Ahmed Merabet - who is believed to have been a Muslim - lies wounded on the pavement . Intelligence officers have been told the brothers attended jihadi training camps in Yemen overseen by Al Qaeda – one is believed to have made two visits, stopping initially in the capital Sanaa. They are said to be checking whether he went there to study. Al Qaeda operates several remote training camps in the east of Yemen that have been the target of US-led drone attacks and where trainers have taught Europeans, including Britons and French nationals. Detectives are trying to confirm the information and seeking to check whether the brothers had received military training in Algeria with militant groups. Both men operated during the Charlie Hebdo shooting with military expertise and precision, using classic tactics when leaving the building and running down the street – one covering the other throughout. They did not waste bullets, firing individual shots or short bursts displaying a calmness that suggested both had previously been in combat, possibly as part of Al Qaeda units fighting Yemen’s Army in the east of the country. Anwar al-Awlaki (pictured) was killed in 2011 but had been a prolific recruiter for AQAP . For in these grim circumstances, AQAP has prospered. The wildness of Yemen provides plenty of remote places to use as training camps, where the group's highly proficient bomb makers can practice their craft. Here they receive basic and then more advanced infantry training of the kind used to devastating effect in Paris yesterday. Covering their advance by sweeping their guns left and right, the two gunmen used single shots rather than blasting away indiscriminately. One of them simply said 'OK Chief' as he murdered a wounded policeman lying helpless on the pavement. These camps were responsible for training both the 'underpants' bomber Abdulmutallab who attempted to blow himself up on a trans-Atlantic flight on Christmas day 2009, and a year later for a sophisticated attempt to smuggle bombs hidden in printers on cargo planes bound for the US in order to kill designated Jewish targets in Chicago. Since the Yemeni armed forces are largely deployed combating separatist rebels, the US has had little choice other than to strike these terrorists with drones, especially since they lurk in inaccessible regions. Some of these strikes have killed considerable numbers of women and children since AQAP terrorists and trainers are often accompanied by dependent family members. That in turn magnifies sympathy for the group within the wider Yemeni population. So although nothing seems to connect a wild tribal society on the verge of ruin with the deaths of witty and sophisticated writers and cartoonists in the 'city of light', unfortunately globalization means that just such a connection exists and it is lethal. And unlike ISIS, which so far has simply incited random individuals to carry out low level attacks involving using cars or knives as weapons, AQAP can evidently mount carefully planned operations, in which the professionalism of the attackers is as evident as their implacable religious fanatacism. The gunmen being hunted by police over the Charlie Hebdo attack are believed to be from militant group Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). The group was established by Yusef al-Ayeri in 2003 in Saudi Arabia, but was forced to flee to Yemen after a series of attacks drove them back. Yemen's weak government allowed the group to rally and gain members, though they are only thought to have around 400 troops today. While their attacks initially focused on targets in the Middle East, such as an attempted suicide attack on Saudi Minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, they quickly spread to Western targets. On Christmas Day in 2009, they were implicated in the underwear bomb plot after Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was discovered on a Detroit-bound plane trying to detonate liquid explosives in his underpants. The following year AQAP also took responsibility for a plot to blow up two devices hidden inside printer cartridges loaded on to cargo planes travelling from Yemen to the United States. One device was discovered during a stopover at East Midlands Airport in Britain, while another was uncovered in Dubai. According to Stanford University the group is currently lead by Yemen-born Nasser al-Wuhayshi, who is an apprentice of Osama Bin Laden and was imprisoned for a time in Yemen, but escaped in 2006 along with 22 others. The group has a global jihadist agenda. Like ISIS, they aim to create a single Arab caliphate, covering Pakistan Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen and the Levant - the area encompassing Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and Israel. If yesterday's attack is confirmed as coming from AQAP, it will be the first time the group has used lone-wolf style tactics, in which gunmen act alone or in small groups to attack targets.","The massacre in France may be because Al Qaeda feels eclipsed by ISIS .

"A bi-partisan congressional group has called on President Barack Obama to publish 28 pages of dossier which they claim proves a financial link between Saudi Arabia and the 9/11 attackers. The report, which was produced by a joint congressional inquiry into the 9/11 attacks was heavily redacted by the then president George W Bush. The Joint Inquiry Into Intelligence Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 2001 was published in December 2002. Former Senator Bob Graham, pictured, who co-wrote a report on the 9/11 attacks has called on President Barack Obama to publish the final 28 pages of the 828-page dossier relating to the financing of the atrocity . The classified 28 pages are believed to outline how the 9/11 terrorists were financed by Saudi Arabia . The 28 pages of the report were redacted, pictured, by George W Bush when the report was published in 2002 . However, 28 pages of the report were blacked-out in a bid to protect the United State's relationship with Saudi Arabia. The pages formed part of a wider 828-page dossier on the atrocity. Former Senator Bob Graham, who co-chaired the probe and helped write the report told ABC News: 'The 28 pages primarily relate to who financed 9/11 and they point a very strong finger at Saudi Arabia as being the principal financier. 'The position of the United States government has been to protect Saudi Arabia. 'At virtually every step of the judicial process, when the United States government was called upon to take a position, it has been a position adverse to the interests of United States citizens seeking justice and protective of the government which, in my judgement, was the most responsible for that network of support.' The former Democratic senator has joined with Republican Walter Jones and Democrat Stephen Lynch as part of his campaign along with families of the victims. Senators Jones and Lynch have introduced legislation to force President Obama to publish the 28 pages. If evidence proving a firm link between Saudi Arabia and the attackers, who were led by Egyptian-born Mohamad Atta, it would be possible for families of victims to sue the oil-rich Kingdom through the U.S. courts.

"Many teenagers seeking to get out of their PE lessons say they are 'allergic to exercise', but for one young woman it is actually true. Tasha Coates, 19, was struck down with a series of life-threatening allergic reactions called anaphylactic shocks beginning in May 2013. She suffered from a mystery illness that caused her to lose her hair and be rushed to hospital more than 30 times in 12 months. Tasha Coates, 19, has become the champion of British Disability Gymnastics - despite suffering from a rare condition which means she can suffer a severe allergic reaction if she gets too hot or sweaty . Miss Coates is allergic to exercise, and was rushed to hospital suffering an anaphylactic shock 30 times in 12 months in 2013 (she is pictured, right, in hospital). But she has found a way of safely practicing her sport with the British Disabled Gymnastics club, and has won many of their competitions (left) Doctors were baffled as to what was causing her reactions, but eventually found she has a rare condition which means getting hot and sweaty can trigger an allergic reaction. While some with this diagnosis would head straight for this sofa, Miss Coates, who has had gymnastic lessons from the age of eight, has found a way of exercising safely and has won a raft of medals and the overall national trophy. She has battled through her illness to win five gold medals and became the champion of British Disability Gymnastics. Miss Coates, who lives in Warrington, Cheshire, said: 'I fell ill when I was 18-years-old after 10 years of doing gymnastics. 'I was allergic to everything and people would hug me and come away with clumps of my hair when it started falling out. 'I would be sat in college doing my work and 10 seconds later I wouldn't be able to breathe - I didn't know what was triggering it.' Miss Coates has  diagnosed with a rare condition which affects her mast cells, which protect against disease and are involved in wound healing. Doctors believe when she gets hot and sweaty, this causes degranulation of her mast cells, which sends her into anaphylactic shock as her body releases too many histamines. Histamines are released when the body detects that foreign matter has entered into it. The histamines signal the body to send blood to the affected area, which causes swelling and inflammation. But for Miss Coates, the histamine response is triggered by her mast cells' abnormal response to getting hot and sweaty. It continues unabated, causing her body tissues to swell up, her blood vessels to become constricted and the tubes in her lungs to become inflamed and constricted, causing her to have difficulty breathing. 'I had never heard of disabled gymnastics and wanted to keep on doing the sport so I sent in an application. 'There are different rules to make competitions safer for disabled people so it's about having fun rather than the serious competitiveness of mainstream gymnastics.' After  Miss Coates has finally been diagnosed with a rare condition which affects her mast cells, which protect against disease and are involved in wound healing.

It began in May last year, when she was out with her friends but began to feel unwell. The next thing she remembers is waking up in the resuscitation department at Royal Liverpool University Hospital. She suffered eight anaphylactic shocks in two weeks, which caused clumps of her hair to fall out in the shower before it all fell out completely. Doctors were baffled as to what was causing Miss Coates' anaphylactic shock, but eventually they found she has a rare condition which affects her mast cells - which protect the body against disease. If she gets too hot or sweaty, they release histamines, which cause an allergic reaction. She is pictured, left and right, in hospital . Miss Coates was also diagnosed with a catalogue of allergies including asthma, oral allergy syndrome, which makes her body think she is ingesting pollen when she eats raw vegetables, as well as eczema, hay fever and Raynaud's syndrome. But she is able to compete in  competitions safely (pictured) if she doesn't exert herself . Miss Coates said: 'My body went into shock and my hair fell out as a result. 'But before I lost it all I went to get some of my hair braided so that it could be used by somebody who has cancer, then I shaved my head until it became even all over.' Doctors finally diagnosed Miss Coates as having catalogue of allergies which leave her, in her own words, 'allergic to life'. On top of the rare condition that affects her mast cells, she has asthma, oral allergy syndrome, which makes her body think she is ingesting pollen when she eats raw vegetables, as well as eczema, hay fever and Raynaud's syndrome. But the allergies are not going to stop Tasha from continuing as a top flight disabled gymnast. Her classes are controlled so she doesn't exert herself and is able to practice the sport safely. Miss Coates has been invited to perform in front of 11,000 spectators at the Artistic Gymnastics British Championships in Liverpool in March. 'It still doesn't feel real and I never dreamed I could be a national champion,' she said . Her medal-winning achievement has caught the attention of mainstream gymnastics officials. She has been invited to perform in front of 11,000 spectators at the Artistic Gymnastics British Championships in Liverpool in March. The A-level student, who studies health and social care and child development at Priestley College in Cheshire, said: 'I want to get more people involved in disabled gymnastics, that would make me happy. 'It still doesn't feel real and I never dreamed I could be a national champion. 'I haven't really been to the gym much lately but hopefully I will be fit enough for the event in March.'","Tasha Coates, 19, suffered  allergic reactions known as anaphylactic shock .

These stunning pictures were taken by photographer Baldur Sveinsson, who was in another plane flying around the volcano. The 72-year-old retired teacher captured the photographs at a volcano in Holuhraun, Iceland. Baldur, from Iceland, travelled with his friend, pilot Elias Erlingsson, to witness the longest and largest eruption in Iceland since 1783. While in the air, he was able to make contact with another plane flying around the volcano and ask them if he could take pictures of them.

These stunning pictures were taken by photographer Baldur Sveinsson, who was in another plane flying around the volcano . Baldur said: 'This eruption started on August 31, 2014, and has been sending lava to the surface since and shows no signs of stopping. 'Myself and a private pilot friend, Elias Erlingsson, decided to go to Holuhraun for sightseeing and see if we could find anyone out there to photograph with the crater as a background. 'The flight from Reykjavík to the eruption took around an hour in our aircraft, an airobatic Cap 10, registered TF-UFO. 'When we arrived, there was a sightseeing flight from the Myvatn area in the vicinity, and we called them up.

"Armed police are today patrolling London's Eurostar terminal as security checks at ports and stations were ramped up in the wake of the gun massacre in Paris. The development came as the head of MI5 warned that the attack at the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine was a 'terrible reminder of the intentions of those who wish us harm'. Home Secretary Theresa May chaired a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee this morning as British police and security agencies closely followed developments in France. Scroll down for video . Armed officers are also on duty at the entrance to Horse Guards in central London, just a short walk from Downing Street and the Houses of Parliament . British Transport Police said they have increased armed patrols at London's St Pancras station to provide reassurance to the public at the Eurostar terminal. A spokesman said: 'Since 2012, we have deployed armed officers within London. 'The safety of rail passengers and staff is of paramount importance to us, and we want to provide a reassuring, visible armed presence to deter terrorism on the rail network. 'In light of the events in Paris, we have increased patrols at St Pancras, in order to maintain and provide enhanced visibility and reassurance to the public. We keep our security arrangements under constant review.' Ahead of a speech in London tonight, Andrew Parker, director general of the Security Service, said . 'It is too early for us to come to judgments about the precise details or origin of the attack but it is a terrible reminder of the intentions of those who wish us harm. ""As you would expect, we are offering our French colleagues our full support as they respond."" Home Secretary Theresa May arrives in Downing Street to chair a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee. Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'We have to fight this terrorism with everything we have' Prime Minister David Cameron, speaking at an event in Manchester, said: 'We have to fight this terrorism with everything we have' Downing Street said there was no specific threat to Britain, but extra measures had been put in place as a precaution. The Government has sent a specialist counter terror police officer to Paris to beef up the UK's anti-terror team in France. David Cameron's official spokesman said: 'What has happened since the incident is, one, the intelligence does not suggest there is any change in the threat level here but on a precautionary basis we have tightened up border security. 'So, I think for example, ports - people going through them will see increased car and truck searches; a bit more scanning of freight. 'They will also see an increased visible presence in the Gare de Nord in Paris.' Downing Street said checks at ports and Eurostar terminals would be stepped up in the wake of the Paris attacks . Armed police stand guard outside the French embassy in central London as Cobra met to agree new security measures . Mr Cameron this morning observed a minute silence in respect of the victims of the massacre. Speaking this morning, the PM said his thoughts were with the French people following the 'appalling' events in Paris. He told business leaders at a conference in Manchester: 'Everyone's thoughts will be with the French people and will be thinking about the appalling events that happened yesterday in Paris. 'These are a challenge to our security because we have to fight this terrorism with everything we have. 'But they are also a challenge to our values and ... when it comes to security we must use every part or vigilance and security we have.' When it comes to values he said the best way to protect them was to 'repeat our belief' in them. He added: 'We stand with them today in defending the values we all hold dear.' It comes after Nick Clegg this morning insisted Britain's security services have a grip on the terror threat as he faced questions about why the Cobra emergency committee is not meeting until 24 hours after the Paris attack. The Deputy Prime Minister stressed that the police, MI5 and MI6 'work flat out all the time regardless of whether a Cobra meeting is taking place in Whitehal. Home Secretary Theresa May will chair the Cobra meeting this morning with security chiefs, police and senior ministers, after what David Cameron described as a 'different' kind of terror plot. Masked gunmen killed 12 people, including four cartoonists and two policeman, in the assault on the Paris offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. A huge manhunt is underway in Paris after police identified two 'armed and dangerous' brothers with links to terrorist groups going back at least a decade. At least seven other people have been arrested. Mrs May last night said that Britain stands with the French people 'at this time for freedom of speech and democracy and against terror'. She warned that the terror threat to the UK is 'grave and relentless'. Mr Cameron has offered the assistance of British spies to help French agencies investigate the atrocity. Metropolitan Police officers and staff stood outside New Scotland Yard to make a two minute silence . Officers stood in the rain to pay their respects to the police officers and journalists killed in Paris . Political journalists, officials and MPs including William Hague, Harriet Harman and John Bercow held up pens and signs ready 'Je suis Charlie' during a two minutes silence in Westminster Hall at the Houses of Parliament . Taking calls on his weekly phone-in, Mr Clegg faced questions about the British response to the attack in Paris and why Cobra did not meet last night. He told LBC: 'Our intelligence services and police work flat out all the time regardless of whether a Cobra meeting is taking place in Whitehall or not. 'They do an extraordinary job and thwart a lot of threats we don't hear about. 'I think it's right that Theresa May is chairing this Cobra meeting this morning to stress test and absolutely check that all the measures that need to be taken in the light of this barbaric murder of journalists in central Paris that every possible eventuality of how that might affect us is properly addressed.' Mr Clegg stressed that a meeting of Cobra was 'just a forum' at which senior security officials can 'double check' the impact of the Paris attack. 'It is not as if nothing happens until a meeting happens in Whitehall', he added. British tourists in Paris, meanwhile, have been warned to take 'extra care' in the wake of today's terrorist gun attack in the French capital which left 12 people dead. The Foreign Office warned there is a 'high threat from terrorism' and attacks 'could be indiscriminate'. The Prime Minister and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were given an extraordinary joint security briefing by British intelligence agencies MI5 and MI6. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg stressed that the police, MI5 and MI6 'work flat out all the time' regardless of whether a Cobra meeting is taking place in Whitehall . The 10-minute briefing was based on what the intelligence agencies had been able to piece together so far from open source material. It highlighted the calm, determined and apparently professional way the killers had carried out the assault. Mr Cameron said: 'This is different from some of the plots that we have seen here in the UK from so-called home-grown terrorists.' The PM added that the UK was 'already at a very high state of alert' and the security services were looking at what more could be done, he said, 'but there is no one single answer to these appalling terrorist attacks'. Defending the right to free speech he said: 'We should be very clear this day that these values that we have are not sources of weakness for us, they are sources of strength. 'Of course there are all sorts of economic things we have to get right but, as we do that, the countries that succeed in the future I think will be those that stick to the values of freedom, of democracy, of the rule of law. 'Those are part of the things that make our economies and our societies and our political systems strong and powerful and good and we must not give those up.' Mr Cameron and Mrs Merkel also spoke to French President Francois Hollande from the Prime Minister's office in No 10, a call the German Chancellor described as a 'very moving moment'. France has raised its terror alert system to the maximum - Attack Alert - and bolstered security with more than 800 extra soldiers to guard media offices, places of worship and other possible targets. French President Francois Hollande chaired an emergency meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris this morning. Britain's terror threat level is currently set at 'severe' but the question of increasing to 'critical', the highest state of alert, is likely to be discussed. It was last raised to critical in 2007 in the wake of terror attacks in London and Glasgow, and indicates an extremely high level of threat. Three masked attackers brandishing Kalashnikovs burst into the Charlie Hebdo headquarters, opening fire on staff after seeking out journalists by name. Those executed included four of the most famous cartoonists in France – men who had regularly satirised Islam and the Prophet Mohammed – including the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Stephane Charbonnier. Witnesses said the suspect Al Qaeda killers were heard to shout 'the Prophet has been avenged' and 'Allahu akbar!' as they stalked the building. Horrific footage also emerged showing an injured police officer slumped on the pavement outside the office as two of the gunmen approach. Suspects: The three men were named as Cherif Kouachi (left), 32, his brother Said Kouachi (right), 34, and Hamyd Mourad, 18, of Gennevilliers . In a statement the Queen said: 'Prince Philip and I send our sincere condolences to the families of those who have been killed and to those who have been injured in the attack in Paris this moming. 'We send our thoughts and prayers to all those who have been affected.' The Foreign Office has updated its travel advice to state: 'If you're in Paris or the Ile de France area, take extra care and follow the security advice issued by the French authorities. 'There is a high threat from terrorism. Attacks could be indiscriminate. Due to ongoing threats to France by Islamist groups, and recent French military intervention against ISIL, the French government has warned the public to be especially vigilant and has reinforced its own domestic and overseas security measures. 'Previous incidents attributed to Islamist extremists have included the shooting of 3 soldiers and 4 civilians in Toulouse, and a knife attack on a soldier near Paris.'","Terror threat against Britain is 'severe' - meaning a attack is highly likely .

"A climber was seen on the top of a 50ft pylon, without a rope or harness, on a 80ft tall cliff at Durlston Country Park in Swanage, Dorset . For many the plunging cliffs in Swanage are the perfect vantage point for a view of the dramatic Jurassic coast. But for one man the view from the 80ft cliff was obviously not enough because he decided to scale a pylon instead. The climber was seen perched at the top of the 50ft pylon at Durlston Country Park in Dorset without any ropes or a harness. Officials feared the unidentified man could easily have been blown off the metal structure and into the ravine below by a gust of wind. There were also concerns for how he had managed to get up the metal structure, used as a nautical marker for shipping, because a ladder does not begin until 12ft up it. He was seen by Kerry Jury, an off duty coastguard. Mrs Jury took a photo of the climber perched on top of the pylon and coastguards have since uploaded it to their website to urge people not to be so reckless near the coast in the future. The incident happened at the Durlston Country Park, near Swanage, Dorset, where there are several mile markers that help ships check their speed. Mrs Jury said: 'I was out walking with my family when I saw this guy at the top of the mile marker. 'I double checked but he definitely wasn't wearing a harness. He seemed like a normal member of the public. 'I have no idea what he was doing up there, but it seemed like he just wanted to check out the view. 'It's quite a dangerous climb. You can't access the ladder right from the bottom, it starts about 12ft up so it's not an easy thing to do. 'Had a gust of wind blown him off he probably would have ended up in the ravine. 'I just thought what an inappropriate thing to do, particularly when it was so busy and there were so many families around. Pylones are located along the top of the cliffs and are used as mile markers for passing boats . The tall cliffs provide views along the Jurassic Coast and there were concerns for the climber's safety .

"A mythical metal said by ancient Greeks to be found in the lost city of Atlantis has been recovered from a ship that sunk 2,600 years ago off the coast of Sicily. Marine archaeologists found 39 ingots of what they believe is 'orichalcum' on the sandy seabed among the wreck of a trading vessel that sank 1,000 feet off the coast of the town of Gela, in southern Sicily. The wreck is the fifth ancient ship to be recovered off the coast of the town. Scroll down for video . One of the lumps of 'orichalcum' that was found on the seabed just off the coast of Gela, in southern Sicily . It is thought that it had been carrying cargo from either Greece or Asia Minor when it was caught in a storm and sunk. Atlantis was first described by the Greek philosopher Plato more than 2,000 years ago. While many believe the story is a myth created by Plato to illustrate his theories about politics, others insist it is based on a real historical disaster. According to Plato's account, written around 360BC, Atlantis was a major sea power located in the Atlantic. It was larger than ancient Libya and Asia Minor (modern Turkey) put together, and was 'the way to the other islands, and from these you might pass to the whole of the opposite continent'. His account included detailed descriptions of the island - with mountains in the north and along the coast, and a plain in the south. Its kings were descended from Poseidon - the god of sea - but their divine lineage became diluted as they mixed with mortals. By around 9600 BC the island had conquered much of Western Europe and Africa and enslaved its enemies. This date would make the city nearly as old as the end of the last ice age and pre-dates the earliest recorded city states, found in what is now Iraq, so seems rather unlikely. After a failed attempt to invade Athens, the entire island sank into the sea 'in a single day and night of misfortune'. Over the centuries, scholars have attempted to locate the real Atlantis - believing the account was based on a real ancient superpower. One of the most plausible theories is that Plato was describing the Minoan civilisation on Crete and the neighbouring island of Santorini which was devastated by a massive volcanic eruption around 1600BC. Some believe the Atlantis myth was inspired by the Black Sea floods of around 5000BC - an event that may have also generated the flood stories which appeared in the Old Testament. Professor Sebastiano Tusa, an archaeologist at the office of the Superintendent of the Sea in Sicily, claimed the metal they had discovered in the remains of the ship was probably the mythical and highly prized red metal orichalcum. Analysis of the metal ingots revealed they were made from an alloy of copper and zinc with traces of nickel, lead and iron. Professor Tusa told the Mail Online that the X-ray fluorescent analysis of the metal had confirmed that it was orichalcum. He said: 'The discovery is unique and exceptional because it is the fist time that we find oricalcum ingots.' Speaking to Discovery News, he added: 'Nothing similar has ever been found. 'We knew orichalcum from ancient texts and a few ornamental objects. 'The wreck dates to the first half of the sixth century. 'It was found about 1,000 feet from Gela's coast at a depth of 10 feet.' If the metal discovered by Professor Tusa and his team is really the mythical orichalcum, then it lends support to the idea of Atlantis as being a real place. The existence of the island is greatly debated among historians and archaeologists. Some believe it is entirely fictional while others claim stories of the 'Island of Atlas' may have been based on a real historical location that was drowned by rising sea levels or a tsunami. The Egyptian city of Heracleion, for example, was lost 1,200 years ago when it was engulfed by the sea. Most of the legend of Atlantis comes from the work of the Greek philosopher Plato, who describes how the great nation was submerged beneath the Atlantic Ocean after falling out of favour with the Gods. Plato mentions orichalcum in the Critias dialogue and describes Atlantis as flashing with the 'red light' of the metal. He wrote that orichalcum was highly prized and second only in value to gold. It was mined in the mythical island and covered the surfaces of Poseidon's temple. The existence of this metal and its composition has since been widely debated, but it is commonly thought to be a brass-like alloy. Brass is made from copper and zinc. It is thought to have been made through a process called cementation, which reacts zinc ore with charcoal and copper in a crucible. This map of Atlantis - oriented with south at the top - was drawn by 17th century scholar Athanasius Kircher, who pinpointed the mythical continent as being in the mid-Atlantic before it was lost to the sea . Professor Sebastiano Tusa, centre, and his team of divers discovered the metal ignots of what they believe to be the mythical metal of orichalcum on a 2,600-year-old shipwreck found off the coast of Gela in Sicily . X-ray fluorescence of the ingots found off the coast of Gela show they were made from 75-80 per cent copper, 15-20 per cent zinc and small amounts of nickel, lead and iron. Professor Tusa told the Mail Online: 'The shipwreck is dated to the beginning of 6th century BC. 'We cannot say how big is the vessel because we have to dig into the sand to recover what it is left of the wooden hull. But I presume that she was about 15 metres (49 feet) long. 'It is a new shipwreck unknown before this discovery.' 'She was sailing to Gela and was entering the harbor situated at the mouth of river Gela. 'Probably during the entrance there was some mistake in the maneuvering because of heavy sea and the ship went into the sandy beach' Professor Tusa said that they also found some Greek vases, a terracotta figure of the Goddess Demeter and some wood in the wreck. He added: 'The finding confirms that about a century after its foundation in 689BC, Gela grew to become a wealthy city with artisan workshops specialised in the production of prized artifacts.' The shipwreck with the ingots was found 1,000 feet off shore of the town of Gela in the sourthern part of Sicily . The metal found on the sea floor off Sicily (above) was found to be an alloy of copper, zinc, lead, nickle and iron . Statues like this one above from the sunken Egyptian city of Heracleion have recently been rediscovered by marine archaeologists, raising hopes that if Atlantis did ever exist then it may still be found under the sea . However, some experts disagree about the composition of orichalcum. Enrico Mattievich, a former physics professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, believes the metal has its origins in the Chavin civilisation that developed in the Peruvian Andes in around 1,200 BC. He claims the metal alloy is made from copper, gold and silver. He claims that the discovery off the coast of Gela is not true orichalcum. Indeed in Ancient Rome, coins made from brass were also said to be made from orichalcum. Professor Tusa said that while he did not believe Atlantis existed, he found the idea of it appealing. He said: 'I think it was a Plato metaphore. But I am happy if this story will continue to raise and feed our fantasy.' The lost civilisation of Atlantis was reputed to have many treasures including buildings clad in the metal  orichalcum that were lost to the sea after the people there apparently fell out of favour with the gods . There have been many locations around the world suggested as potential sites for the lost island of Atlantis .","Marine archaeologists found 39 ingots of 'orichalcum' off the town of Gela .

"An elderly couple fear their £210,000 bungalow could be swallowed up after a giant sink hole appeared in their front garden. Great-grandparents David Mason, 77, and his wife Sylvia, 75, first spotted a small hole by the kerb outside their home on December 30 but thought it was caused by a lorry. But the hole expanded at a 'staggering' speed and now measures 16ft by 12ft and is only a few feet away from their front door. David Mason, 77, surveys the hole that has appeared in front of his home in Cottingham, Northamptonshire . The 3ft-deep crater was first caused by a burst water main but heavy rain meant it grew even further . Mr Mason fears the sinkhole could swallow up his home - he moved in to the property three years ago . The 3ft-deep crater was first caused by a burst water main but heavy rain meant it grew even further. The couple, who have two grown-up daughters, four grandchildren and one great-granddaughter, now fear they may have to leave the bungalow they purchased three and a half years ago. Mr Mason, who lives at the property in Cottingham, Northamptonshire, said today: 'I am genuinely concerned about the safety of our property because the hole is creeping nearer our front door almost by the hour. 'My wife is disabled after having a stroke a few years ago and this is causing more worry for her because if we have to get out we don't know where we'll go. 'The speed of it happening has been quite staggering.' Mr Mason, who ran a motorcycle repair business before he retired, added: 'It got progressively worse, so I got the police out and they put a temporary barrier around it. 'They must have contacted someone because later that night someone came out to put a more permanent enclosure around the hole. 'It was amazing how rapidly it escalated. We just sat and watched it happen in front of our eyes.' Mr Mason said it was 'staggering' and 'amazing' how rapidly the sink hole escalated outside his home . The retired great-grandparents fear they may have to leave their bungalow because of the sinkhole . The initial burst water main was fixed by Anglia Water, but an assessor came to inspect the hole and found another leak. Mr Mason said: 'We have not contacted the insurers yet because we need to know exactly how bad the situation is going to get. 'Hopefully the hole will stop getting any bigger but it's a worrying time.'","David Mason, 77, and wife Sylvia, 75, spotted hole outside home last week .

"Benjamin Wilson, from Billingham, was jailed for six years after admitting wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm . A son has been jailed for a horrific hammer attack on his father after snapping over tears of 'excessive and extreme' domestic violence. Benjamin Wilson, from Billingham, was defending his mother when he beat his father Craig with a lump hammer . The attack left his father - who was described as a 'violent nasty drunk' in court - with brain damage and holes in his head. The 22-year-old, who is a new father himself, had grown up in 'an atmosphere of violence, fear and intimidation' and was subjected to violence himself. He was jailed for six years after admitting wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, but the sentence has sparked outrage. Thousands of people have signed a petition calling for Benjamin Wilson to be freed. The 'Free Ben Wilson' e-petition has more than 20,000 signatures from around the world, and a 'Help Free Ben Wilson' Facebook page has thousands of likes. The petition, which was set up by Marie Taylor, says: 'Ben got 6 years for protecting his mother and himself from an abusive man under the influence of alcohol.

'Save this boy from more years of [torture] he has suffered enough and his family.' Tammy Jones, from Portsmouth, wrote: 'He was defending his mum after years of both physical and to both mental abuse.' Anita Homer added: 'This is appalling!!! We have a wonky, unfair and non standardised jurisdiction. 'There are so many cases where a person has intentionally killed someone and only received very short sentences. 'This lad's behaviour was not intentional. He only wanted to protect his mom.' Alex Loveridge, from Christchurch in New Zealand, added: 'I'm signing because even though using a hammer to stop someone is wrong in his circumstances it's completely justifiable and my heart breaks for him.' Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC told Teesside Crown Court that the case was a sustained attack with a 'fearsome weapon' on a defenceless man. The court heard the 22-year-old, pictured, had grown up in 'an atmosphere of violence, fear and intimidation' and was subjected to violence himself . But he said the alcoholic father, described in court as a 'violent nasty drunk' had subjected his family to domestic abuse, and the son had been the victim of such abuse and violence. Craig Wilson was described in court as a 'Jekyll and Hyde', who once served a two-year sentence for assaulting his wife. During that assault on New Year's Eve 2007, the 46-year-old put both hands around his wife's neck and pressed so hard her eyes bled and she passed out. Benjamin Wilson's sentence was reduced by the judge from 12 years to six, because of his good character and 'the degree and nature of the provocation that you've faced, not only on that occasion but on other occasions'.

"Hundreds of die-hard chicken sandwich fans swarmed Chick-fil-a locations in three states Wednesday, where they set up parking lot tent cities in bone-chilling bids to win a year's worth of free food. The campers hoping to be among the first 100 customers at new stores in Kansas, Virginia and South Carolina lined up just as the current polar plunge brought the weeks lowest temperatures yet this season across much of America. Because the stores weren't slated to open until 6am Thursday, the campers braved the frigid night as temperatures plunged to as low as -10F for some. Bone-chilling: Chick-fil-a fans in Kansas (pictured), South Carolina and Virginia braved Wednesday night lows that dipped to -10F in the hopes of winning free food at the chicken sandwich chain . First 100: The chicken fans vied to be among the first 100 customers at three new locations that opened Thursday morning . Campers at the Derby, Kansas opening faced those lowest of lows and, perhaps unsurprisingly, only around 50 people had set up their tents and portable heaters in the lot as the sun set Wednesday. As such, 50 more lucky breakfast customers would be rewarded with a coveted gift card loaded with some $32,000 worth of free food, reports MyFoxDC. Campers at the  Northern Virginia location were slightly more fortunate than their Kansan comrades, but not by much. Hundreds packed the lot in Dumfries Wednesday as overnight lows plummeted to near zero and relentless wind chills made the temperature feel like 10 below.

As night fell, the dedicated fast food lovers braved temperatures as low as -10F . Welcome! The Dumfries, Virginia chain opened with a raucous welcome from employees for the lucky first customers . The campers' got what they came for as doors opened early Thursday and they were treated to a raucous welcome from store staff--one dressed as the chain's cow mascot--in addition to the massive gift cards. The most fortunate of the lot spent their nights waiting for a Powdersville, South Carolina store to open. While the most southerly of the day's openings, the Palmetto State's came during a stretch of uncharacteristically low temperatures. Even as the doors opened Thursday, and hours after, weather authorities in the area warned of dangerous wind chills that could feel as low as 10 below. 'My husband said I'm nuts,' South carolina camper Joy Boudreau told WLOS on Wednesday evening. 'He packed me two sleeping bags, an air mattress, a bed roll and I think he's bringing by another blanket. He thinks I'm crazy, he's staying home nice and warm.' In Kansas, only around 50 had lined up by Wednesday evening, meaning  50 more lucky breakfast customers would be rewarded with a coveted gift card loaded with some $32,000 worth of free food .

"A Michigan family made a frantic 911 call begging for help after their minivan became lodged beneath a moving semi-truck in a snowstorm. Matthew Menz, 46, was driving with his wife and two grown children south of Roscommon, Michigan, early Wednesday morning when their vehicle rear-ended a truck and became stuck. Just before 2am, Pamela Menz called 911 telling the dispatcher that their snow-encased minivan was being dragged by the truck-trailer along northbound I-75. Scroll down for video . Family: (From left to right) Justin Menz, Jennifer Menz and their Matt Menz (seen holding an unidentified woman) were in the minivan with their mother Pamela Menz when it got stuck to the semi-truck's trailer . Scary: Deputies helped the family of four early Wednesday morning, after their minivan was unwittingly hauled by the semi-truck for 16 miles in the snow . 'It was snow blinding. We ran into the back of a semi-truck and he's not stopping and our car is embedded underneath of it,' the caller said. 'Our windshields have completely shattered. I can't see nothing.' 'I just want to get off the back of this thing,' Mrs Menz pleaded on the call, which lasted for more than 20 minutes. Law enforcement officials estimate that the Menzs' 2001 Toyota Sienna was dragged down the road for 16 miles before before they were rescued. Menz was  returning from an airport with her husband Matt Menz behind the wheel, as the couple's children Justin and Jennifer, were passengers, UpNorthLive reported. The Roscommon County Sheriff's Office said snowfall prevented the family from telling 911 where they were exactly, and that deputies for both Roscommon and Crawling counties went to help. Matt Menz told UpNorthLive of the semi-truck driver 'He apparently didn't know that we were there and before we knew it, he ended up dragging us 16 miles. 'I was on the phone with 911 for the whole time. It's a hopeless feeling, helpless feeling. Out of control, you're just along for the ride.' Justin Menz has autism and was launched from the backseat into his sister's seat in the minivan, the website reported. Jennifer Menz told UpNorthLive '[I] started to console him, and take care of him, and tell him it was okay. I started to call him down. When the airbags went off, just that smell like we were going to catch on fire and I thought we were.' The 911 dispatcher initially asked if they could honk to alert the driver of the semi, but Mrs Menz replied that their minivan lost all power and had no heat, Mlive.com reported. 'We have nothing; we’ve lost everything,' Pamela Menz said. Terror: The Roscommon County Sheriff's Office said that snowfall prevented the Menz from telling 911 where they were . Incident: The Menz family was on the phone with 911 for 25 minutes until deputies showed up and were able to help them . At one point, the family thought the truck was slowing down to get off the highway, and the dispatcher asked if they could jump out of the minivan at the exit ramp, but the family had no idea where they were. The dispatcher was able to pinpoint their location using GPS and determined that the two vehicles had just crossed into Crawford County. About 35 minutes into the ordeal, sheriff's deputies showed up and were able to help the stranded family. In a release, the sheriff's office said 'The vehicles were later intercepted by deputies from the Crawford County Sheriff’s Office, south of Grayling on northbound I-75. 'Deputies successfully stopped the vehicles without incident, 16 miles from where the original collision had occurred.' Authorities took the four people to a nearby hospital, and 'no serious injuries are suspected,' the release said. The unsuspecting semi-truck driver was reportedly upset after learning of what happened and told police he did not want to drive his truck again, according to MyFox Detroit, .","Pamela and Matt Menz, along with their children Justin and Jennifer, were in a minivan coming home from an airport early Wednesday morning .

"Nine visitors to Disney's theme park in California have developed measles and three others are suspected of having contracted the virus which had been eliminated in the United States since 2000. Seven people from California and two from Utah have now been diagnosed with measles. All of the sufferers visited Disneyland or Disneyland California Adventure between December 15 and December 20. The California Department of Public Health has issued an alert, warning that anyone who suspects they may have been infected to go and see their doctor immediately. Scroll down for video . Public health officials confirmed that nine people who contracted measles all visited Disneyland, pictured . The measles virus, pictured, can survive in the air or on surfaces for two hours after a cough or sneeze . Measles sufferers first develop a fever, cough and runny nose then an irritating rash, file photograph . According to the health alert: 'Based on information from current cases, it is likely that a person infectious with measles was at one of the theme parks on these dates. 'People can be infectious with measles for nine days. Measles typically begins with fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes and within a few days a red rash appears, usually first on the face and then spreads downward to the rest of the body. 'Measles is a highly infectious, airborne disease.' The California Department of Public Health confirmed that measles was eradicated in the U.S. in 2000, although the country remains at risk from foreign visitors carrying the infection. The alert continued: 'Large measles outbreaks have occurred in Western Europe, Pakistan, Vietnam and the Philippines in recent years. 'Travellers to areas where measles is endemic can bring measles back to the U.S., resulting in limited domestic transmission of measles. Disney and other theme parks in California are international attractions and visitors come from many parts of the world, including those where measles is endemic.' The victims are aged between eight months and 21 years. Six of the sufferers had not been innoculated against the disease, although two of those were too young to be given the MMR vaccine. Three other cases are under investigation while a massive tracing effort is underway in a bid to prevent a major outbreak. California Public Health official Dr Ron Chapman said: 'The best way to prevent measles and its spread is to get vaccinated.' He urged anyone who may have been infected to check immediately with a doctor. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, measles is a highly contagious virus that lives in an infected person's nose and throat mucus and spreads through coughing and sneezing. The CDC warned: Measles virus can live for up to two hours on a surface or in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed . 'If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected.' Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes and a red rash that usually first appears on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Disney officials said they had not received any reports of staff contracting measles. Park officials are working with the health department to provide any necessary information, said Dr. Pamela Hymel, chief medical officer for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. The CDPH warned medics to ask patients if they have either travelled to areas with a measles problem or locations domestically with a large number of foreign tourists from infected areas.","Nine people who contracted measles all visited Disneyland in California .

"Celebrity chef Giada De Laurentiis announced her split from husband Todd Thompson after 11 years of marriage last week. But the breakdown in their relationship quickly spawned unfounded claims of an affair with the Today show's Matt Lauer. Then there were also rumors concerning fellow chef Bobby Flay, after the pair were seen dining together in New York just days before the 44-year-old Food Network star announced her breakup at the end of December. However Giada has now said any suggestions of romance involving the two - which first surfaced in Star magazine - were false. Strictly professional: Celebrity chef Giada De Laurentiis says any suggestion of a romantic involvement with Matt Lauer (left) or Bobby Flay (right) are false, following her separation with husband Todd Thompson . 'My long-time friendships with my co-workers Matt Lauer and Bobby Flay are exactly that — long-time friendships,' she said in a statement to website Gossip Cop. 'There has never been a romantic relationship with these two men,' she added. Giada and her husband, fashion designer Todd Thompson, separated in July but only announced the split last week. The couple have a six-year-old daughter, Jade. Their separation comes three years after Giada was forced to deny claims she had been cheating on Todd with musician John Mayer, 37. Denial: Three years before announcing her split from husband Todd Thompson, Giada De Laurentiis was forced to deny claims she had hooked up with John Mayer . Speaking to Redbook magazine about the claims in 2011, Giada called it unexpected and insisted nothing had happened with the Your Body Is A Wonderland singer. Star magazine reported that the duo had a 'steamy hookup' at the Gansevoort Hotel in New York, in 2010 but Giada revealed her husband was actually in New York with her when she was alleged to have been with John. And she revealed Todd's embarrassment that his family in Michigan might believe it was true. She told Redbook: 'I was shocked. And not so much for me, but for my husband and family. My family is used to that sort of thing. But my husband's family is not. Todd was embarrassed that his family in Michigan would see it and think, What is going on over there in Hollywood?' Giada admitted she had met John in the past but insisted it was nothing more than a brief introduction and she hadn't seen him in three years before the alleged fling took place. John's rep also told E! News: 'The claims are absolutely ridiculous.' Giada's representative told MailOnline on Wednesday: 'She barely knows John Mayer. She met him at an event and chatted with him for about five minutes and that is the extent of her contact with him.' Separate paths: Giada and Todd, shown in February in New York City, separated back in July . The chef and Todd appear to be having an amicable split, with Giada writing on Facebook: 'After an amicable separation since July, Todd and I have decided to end our marriage. Although our decision to separate comes with a great deal of sadness, our focus on the future and overwhelming desire for our family's happiness has given us the strength to move forward on separate, yet always connected paths. 'Todd and I share a beautiful daughter and a lifetime of great memories that we both treasure more than anything. We are so thankful for our friends and family, and really appreciate the support in this time of change,' she added. The statement did not mention if divorce proceedings had started. 'Thanks so much for your support in this time of change...', Giada tweeted on Monday night to her more than one million followers on Twitter. The couple were married in May 2003. Giada won a Daytime Emmy Award in 2008 for Outstanding Lifestyle Host for her show Giada At Home. Happier times: Giada is shown with Todd and their daughter Jade in February in Miami Beach, Florida . She was born in Rome, Italy and her maternal grandfather is the noted Italian film producer Dino De Laurentiis whose producing credits include the Fellini films La Strada and Nights Of Cabiria and the 1992 cult classic Army Of Darkness. After her parents' divorce, she and her siblings moved to Southern California, where they grew up. Giada graduated from UCLA in 1996 with a degree in social anthropology. Along with her cooking show and contributions to the Today show, Giada also came out with a line of kitchen supplies for Target in 2010.

"A shameless prisoner has sparked outrage after smuggling a phone in to jail and posing for a selfie which he then uploaded on to Facebook. Jack Carter took the picture with another inmate, who was also snapped staring down the camera in Wymott Prison in Lancashire. The 29-year-old then posted it on Facebook with the caption: 'selfie in my cellfie haha get on it.' A friend asked him to send him his number and asked if he had credit, referring to him as a #LEGEND. Carter is currently serving time following a recall for prison, in which he breached the conditions of his licence. His original offence was for attempted grievous bodily harm. Jack Carter (left), with another inmate, in the snap he put on Facebook with the caption 'selfie in my cellfie' A Prison Service spokesman said an investigation was ongoing and could not give a comment about the prisoner. She said: 'We have made clear that it is totally unacceptable for prisoners to access social networking sites or instruct others to do so on their behalf. 'No prisoner should be in any doubt that if they break the rules they will be stripped of their privileges and may be reported to the police for further action. 'We have an agreement with Facebook to close down accounts being updated by or on behalf of serving prisoners.' Carter is currently serving time in Wymott prison, near Chorley in Lancashire, following a recall for prison, in which he breached the conditions of his licence. His original offence was for attempted grievous bodily harm . The prison holds 1,100 prisoners - use of a mobile behind bars is punishable with up to two more years inside . The selfie comes in the wake of new legislation proposed in Parliament to cut prisoners off from their mobile phones. Phone networks will be forced to block mobile phones and SIM cards if they are being used in prison as a suggested amendment to the Serious Crime Bill. It is hoped the new legislation will take advantage of cutting-edge detection equipment to allow prisons to identify unauthorised phones. Prison guards seize around 130 mobiles every week which are frequently used to run rackets inside from drug smuggling to contract killings or to harass their former victims or witnesses, . Use of a mobile behind bars is already punishable with a sentence of up to two more years in jail and an unlimited fine, but around 7,000 criminals still use them inside. The most recent figures available show that a total of 7,451 illicit mobile phones were seized in prisons in England and Wales in 2013. Glyn Travis, from the Prison Officers' Association, told MailOnline: 'There's nothing unusual about this. It's another example of prisoners abusing the system. 'I think the Ministry of Justice have shown some form of action but it has not been done quick enough. It is too little too late. 'The only thing they can do is to put blockers on mobile phones in prisons. 'What the Ministry of Justice should do now is to fine the prisoner who has posted this selfie and give him an additional prison sentence to send a message out. 'As far as I'm aware, that has never been used yet but they should now prosecute to show it is being taken seriously.'","Inmate Jack Carter took picture with fellow prisoner in Wymott Prison .

"A father who tortured and killed his three-year-old son and four-year-old daughter has been sentenced to death. John DeBlase from Mobile, Alabama, was found guilty of two counts of murder in November for poisoning Natalie and Chase with antifreeze and strangling them. The 31-year-old and his wife Heather Keaton - who will also be tried for the killings in April - were then arrested after the children's bodies were dumped in a rural area in Mississippi in 2010. Chase's remains were found six months after he was killed. The pair's biological mother, Corinne DeBlase, wept silently as the court heard how the search for her children unfolded before he was sentenced on Thursday. Murderer: John DeBlase walks to his seat in a courtroom in Mobile, Alabama, before being sentenced to death for torturing and killing his two young children . Gruesome: The 31-year-old poisoned four-year-old Natalie (left) and three-year-old Chase with anti-freeze before strangling them and dumping their bodies in Mississippi in 2010 . According to AL.com Circuit Judge Rick Stout had two options in deciding DeBlase's fate: either life without possibility of parole or death by lethal injection. He told the court that the killings were 'especially heinous, atrocious and cruel,' and included 'completely consciousless, pitiless torture of the victims.' He then sentenced DeBlase to death after it was suggested by the jury. In a bid to save his own life, DeBlase addressed the judge before sentencing and said: 'I am not going to beg for mercy, I'm going to ask for mercy. I'm going to ask for my life. Your honor, I love my kids.' During the trial John DeBlase's attorneys argued that Keaton's harsh discipline tactics lead to the children's deaths, but prosecutors said DeBlase likely killed the children to end their suffering. 'I don't think there's any doubt that the person who had the motive and hatred was Heather Keaton,' defense attorney Glenn Davidson said during his closing arguments Tuesday. 'She had no regard for the children and evidence showed she had no concern for their safety or their well-being. She was consumed with jealousy of Natalie's relationship with her father. When she couldn't control the children, she killed them.' Horrifying: Circuit Judge Rick Stout told the court the pair's deaths were especially heinous, atrocious and cruel,' and included 'completely consciousless, pitiless torture of the victims.' Their biological mother wept as DeBlase was sentenced . Accomplice: Heather Keaton, DeBlase's common-law wife (right), will be tried separately for the killings in April. Prosecutors said DeBlase likely killed the children to end their suffering at the hands of Keaton . Earlier in the trial, Corrine DeBlase said she had given up custody of her daughter Natalie, four, and three-year-old son Chase to John DeBlase in 2008 because she thought he was a 'good father'. 'He was their father, he was supposed to protect them. That's what a father is supposed to do,' she told the jury. She added: 'Nobody can blame me more than I can blame myself. I know there are things I could have done then. I was their mother I should have done something.' Mrs DeBlase said she had been forced to give up custody of her 'well-mannered' children after she lost her job and home, and her marriage collapsed. She said that her ex-husband mainly treated Natalie like 'his little princess', but had once 'popped her in her mouth' when she was suffering from a night terror, according to AL.com. Devastated: Earlier in the trial, Corrine DeBlase, the children's biological mother said she had given up custody of her daughter Natalie, four, and three-year-old son Chase to John DeBlase in 2008 because she thought he was a 'good father' The last time she had seen her children was November 17, 2009. A year later, she was told the youngsters were missing, Fox 10 reported. 'They were my heart. It may not seem the way they make it look but I loved them so much. I loved them so much and I can’t have no more (kids),' Mrs DeBlase told the court. Yesterday, Brandon Newburn a former cellmate of DeBlase, claimed the suspect wrote a series of letters saying he choked the youngsters to 'end their suffering' at the hands of Keaton. In the 10 letters, DeBlase reportedly said Keaton rained 'tortures and abuse' on his children at their home in Mobile County, Alabama, before finally giving him an ultimatum that it was 'her or the kids'.","John DeBlase from Mobile, Alabama, found guilty of murder in November .

"The Connecticut Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that state officials aren't violating the rights of a 17-year-old girl by forcing her to undergo cancer chemotherapy she doesn't want. The decision came in the case of the girl known in court documents only as Cassandra C., who will be free to make her own medical decisions when she turns 18 in September. She, with the support of her mother, had fought against the six-month course of chemotherapy which doctors said would give her an 85 per cent chance of survival. The case centered on whether the girl is mature enough to determine how to treat her Hodgkin lymphoma, which she was diagnosed with in September. Several other states recognize the 'mature minor doctrine.' Cassandra's chemo resumed on December 17, with surgery to install a port in her chest that would be used to administer the drugs, after she initially refused the treatment for her Hodgkin lymphoma . Jackie Fortin, pictured on January 2, at her home in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, said she and her daughter just want to seek alternative treatments that don't include the 'poison' of chemotherapy . The court ruled that her lawyers had the opportunity to prove her maturity during a Juvenile Court hearing in December and failed to do so 'under any standard'. The teen, for example, was allowed to go home to undergo treatment in November but instead ran away for a week, according to court documents. 'Cassandra either intentionally misrepresented her intentions to the trial court or she changed her mind on this issue of life and death,' Chief Justice Chase T. Rogers said. Hodgkins lymphoma (cells pictured) is a disease of the white blood cells . Hodgkin's Lymphoma is cancer of the white blood cells called B lymphocytes that circulate around the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body. The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes. Lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes or glands. These lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. The most common symptom of HL is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. It usually affects young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50. The cause is unknown but risk factors include medical conditiona that weakens your immune system, taking immunosuppressant medication and being previously exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (which causes glandular fever). It isn't thought a family member having the disease increases the chances of developing it. The only way to confirm a diagnosis of HL is by carrying out a biopsy. Almost all young people with HL will be fully cured. For older people over the age of 50, the cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent. Treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and drugs including steroids. A more lengthy written decision will come at a later date, she said. Cassandra currently is confined in a room at Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford, where she is being forced to undergo chemotherapy. Without it, they said there was a near-certainty of death within two years. The teen's mother, Jackie Fortin of Windsor Locks, said after the arguments on Thursday that she wouldn't allow her daughter to die. The single mother said she and her daughter just want to seek alternative treatments that don't include putting the 'poison' of chemotherapy into her daughter's body. 'This is her decision and her rights, which is what we are here fighting about,' Fortin said. 'We should have choices about what to do with our bodies.' Fortin and her lawyer said they are considering their next step after losing the case, but expect to go back to the trial court in an attempt to more fully explore the mature minor argument. After Cassandra was diagnosed with high-risk Hodgkin lymphoma, she and her mother missed several appointments, prompting doctors at Connecticut Children's Medical Center to notify the state Department of Children and Families, court documents said. The child welfare agency investigated and a trial court granted the agency temporary custody of Cassandra. Lawyers for Cassandra and her mother then sought an injunction prohibiting medical treatment but were unsuccessful. Cassandra's treatment resumed on December 17, with surgery to install a port in her chest that would be used to administer the drugs. Chemotherapy began the next day and continues. Assistant Attorney General said Cassandra exhibited the 'magical thinking' of an immature child, believing that if she ignored the cancer it would go away and using the slang of the day was 'blowing off the severity of her condition'. Child welfare agency officials defended their treatment of Cassandra, saying they have a responsibility to protect the girl's life. 'This is a curable illness, and we will continue to ensure that Cassandra receives the treatment she needs to become a healthy and happy adult,' the agency said in a statement. Cassandra currently is confined in a room at Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford, where she is being forced to undergo chemotherapy, which doctors said would give her an 85 per cent chance of survival .","Court ruled her lawyers had the opportunity to prove her maturity during a Juvenile Court hearing in December and failed  'under any standard'
The teen was allowed to go home to undergo treatment in November but instead ran away for a week, according to court documents .
The teen's mother, Jackie Fortin, said she and her daughter just want to seek alternative treatments that don't include  the 'poison' of chemotherapy .
She said: 'This is her decision and her rights, which is what we are here fighting about. We should have choices about what to do with our bodies'"
"India's tourism minister will provide emergency helpline numbers for foreign tourists and a list of dos and don'ts in a bid to prevent further attacks on women. The proposal comes a week after a 22-year-old Japanese tourist was allegedly lured to a Buddhist shrine then locked in a basement at gunpoint and raped repeatedly by two men. The rape accusation is the latest in a long list of headline-grabbing attacks on women - both Indian and foreign - which has sent tourism numbers plunging. A plain-clothes policeman (L) escorts two men who were arrested in connection with the alleged abduction and gang-rape of a Japanese tourist, outside a court in Kolkata . Tourism officials estimate that visitors numbers are already down 20 to 30 per cent compared to last year. Reports  suggest the latest victim's captors were part of a gang of tour guides who first befriend tourists then sexually exploit them across three states: Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Six men have been arrested. 'The incident is a national shame',  India's tourist minister Mahesh Sharma told reporters. Tourism numbers have dropped following a string of high-profile attacks on women . He added to the CNN-IBN news network: 'We are only getting 6.9 million tourists in a year so that's a matter of concern for us. We have to take care of the security of travellers'. Seven million is a low figure for tourism given the country's size, cultural and architectural heritage, beautiful scenery and diverse ecosystems. British nationals make up 800,000 of those visitors. Despite it's beautiful scenery and size, India attracts less than seven million tourists a year . Even the Taj Mahal is suffering, witnessing a 6.8 per cent decline last year  of foreign visitors from 2013. The tourism sector of Agra, the city in which the Taj Mahal resides, has blamed the rising crime rate in the region. India's Tourism Minister has introduced new measures to try and keep visitors safe . In comparison Thailand receives 27 million tourists a year, almost four times as much as India. Officials have said by 2016 they want to increase India's share of the world's tourists by one per cent, a small amount for such a large country. Earlier this year a visa-on-arrival system was introduced to make travel there easier. Mr Sharma also announced plans to reserve train carriages  for tourists who book in advance, with better facilities and possibly security cameras. Some other attempts to make tourists safer have proved unworkable. In the summer of 2013, the National Tourism Advisory Council issued badges for taxi drivers and guides to wear that said 'I respect women'. While most stays are trouble-free, the latest advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office states: 'Women should use caution when travelling in India. Reported cases of sexual assault against women and young girls are increasing; recent sexual attacks against female visitors in tourist areas and cities show that foreign women are also at risk. Even tourist hotspots such as Kerala have been affected by the drop in visitor numbers . 'British women have been the victims of sexual assault in Goa, Delhi, Bangalore and Rajasthan and women travellers often receive unwanted attention in the form of verbal and physical harassment by individuals or groups of men. 'Serious sexual attacks involving Polish, German and Danish women travellers were reported in 2014.' The official advice recommends exercising caution even if in a group and avoiding isolated areas, including beaches, when alone at any time of day. Even the Taj Mahal has suffered, witnessing a 6.8 per cent decline last year of foreign visitors from 2013 . Female travellers should avoid travelling alone on public transport, taxis or auto-rickshaws and when collected at the airport by a hotel driver, visitors should make sure their drivers properly identify themselves before getting in, they say. India has faced intense scrutiny over its efforts to curb violence against women after the fatal gang rape of a medical student on a bus in New Delhi in December 2012, which sparked a global outcry. The most recent attack echoes that of a 25-year-old Japanese woman who was gang-raped in 2010 while she was on her way to the railway station in Gaya. Official advise from UK foreign office says female lone travellers should take care when getting in rickshaws . Sex attacks against women from Western countries, including the US and Britain, have received major media coverage and tourism bosses are growing wary of their negative impact. In January 2014 a 51-year-old Danish tourist was robbed and gang-raped at knifepoint in Delhi in a case that grabbed national and international headlines. In 2013 a Swiss cyclist holidaying in the central state of Madhya Pradesh was robbed and raped by five men, all of whom were later jailed for life.","Last week 22-year-old Japanese tourist allegedly escaped kidnapping .

"A shark attack was probably never going to stop this teenage surfer from getting back in the water. Rip Curl sponsored-surfer Kirra-Belle Olsson was bitten by a shark when she went for a morning surf at Avoca Beach on the NSW Central Coast in October last year. The 13-year-old recalls ‘something was pulling my foot underwater’ but she ignored it, thinking it was just a friend trying to scare her. But when she noticed a tail nearby, she quickly dashed back to shore and found gashes on her foot when she pulled her wetsuit up. Scroll down for video . Surfer Kirra-Belle Olsson was bitten by a shark in October but she returned to the water just a month later . Her mates and a professional photographer were on the beach when the shark struck. Kirra was treated by bystanders and was rushed to Gosford Hospital. Three months on, Kirra, from Copacabana on the Central Coast NSW told Daily Mail Australia she actually returned to the water just one month after the incident. ‘I kind of forgot about the shark attack,’ Kirra told Daily Mail Australia. ‘It didn’t put me off surfing. Not at all – I’ve put it behind me and pretty much carried on with my normal life. ‘My friends were very shocked and a bit worried when they heard the news but they knew I would be alright – they supported me through it.’ The 13-year-old took out first place in the under-18's girl’s Subway Summer Surf Series in November . The Rip Curl sponsored-surfer came first in the under-14's at the Australian Junior Surfing Titles . Surfing runs in the family for Kirra, who is the niece of pro surfer Matt Wilkinson . The teenage surfer suffered injuries to her lower calf muscle, as well as puncture wounds to her foot but she recovered in time to take out the under-18's girl’s Subway Summer Surf Series and under-14's Junior Surfing Title in Australia. Surfing runs in the family for Kirra, who is the niece of pro surfer Matt Wilkinson. With the summer holiday on, she has been keeping herself busy at the beach with training ahead of the Surfer Armour competition at Avoca Beach, which will be held on Friday. When she isn’t in the water, she says she’s just a ‘normal kid’ who goes to school. ‘I train around eight hours a day when I’m not at school but I’ve been able to juggle both – And I still have time to chill and hang with my friends,' she said. In October, the multiple state title-winning surfer was attacked by a shark when she went surfing on morning . The dramatic moment Kirra was carried off the beach by her father's friend Matt Stienweid after the attack . Gruesome photo shows where the shark bit into her left ankle but said it hasn't deterred her from surfing . Her dad Jamie (right) said he is very proud of his daughter and added: 'She's definitely my hero' Her proud father Jamie said he is relieved that his daughter is safe and doing what she loves most. ‘I’m very proud and it’s good to see the results and hard work she puts in,’ Mr Olsson told Daily Mail Australia. ‘She’s doing very well and I’m relieved that the attack didn’t put her off going in the water. ‘She’s tough and she doesn’t like getting second place but she’s definitely making a good name for herself in the surfing world. ‘We have a running joke in the family that started after the attack that I wished my two boys were as tough as her but yeah I can’t say so myself because I wish I was tough as her too. ‘She’s definitely my hero.’ Kirra has been keeping herself busy training ahead of Friday's competition Surfer Armour at Avoca Beach .

"An Australian man joked about a skydiving plane crashing just moments before he was forced to jump from the aircraft as it plunged into a lake. Scott Burnett, 28, was one of the 13 survivors on board a bright pink sky diving plane when it nosedived into  Lake Taupo on New Zealand's north island on Wednesday, stuff.co.nz reports. The truck driver from Adelaide sustained just three scratches after jumping out of the plane attached to his instructor when things took a turn for the worst. Scroll down for video . British television producer Rebekah Millichip, who lives in Sydney, was among the 13 people who had to jump from the plunging plane at Lake Taupo on New Zealand's north island on Wednesday . Bright pink Skydive Taupo plane has since been pulled from Lake Taupo after it nosedived into shallow water . 'I did have a few jokes with the guys on board on the way up about the possibility of the plane dropping into the lake, having a bit of banter, joking around,' Mr Burnett said. 'I didn't actually think a minute or two later it would actually happen.' The Skydive Taupo plane suffered engine problems shortly after take-off, with the pilot ordering everyone on-board to get out. 'What was originally meant to be a 15,000 foot jump soon turned into a 1,500 foot jump (for myself),' he wrote on his Facebook. 'The others jumped out anywhere from 1,800 feet down to the pilot who jumped out last of all from his escape hatch at around 1,200 feet or so.' There were six crew and six passengers on board. The other tourists are believed to be Dutch and Canadian . Ambulance crews reported that, remarkably, just one person required treatment for scratches after plunging into a bush . Mr Burnett was fourth out of the plane before it crashed in shallow water in the lake. British television producer Rebekah Millichip, who lives in Sydney, was also among the six tourists who had to jump from the plunging plane. 'The irony of my story was that I intended to skydive to overcome my fear of it. Having to emergency jump from an exploding plane completely overthrew it,' she told the New Zealand Herald. The Skydive Taupo plane suffered engine problems shortly after take-off, with the pilot ordering everyone on-board to get out as it plunged into the shallow water of Lake Taupo . The plane wreck has since been removed from the shallow water. Civil aviation officials and local police are continuing investigations after speaking with the skydiving company . 'Watching a plane - I had ten seconds prior been sat on - crash and explode into the lake below me whilst I was still suspended mid-air was perhaps one of the most surreal moments of my life.' There were six crew and six passengers on board. The other tourists are believed to be Dutch and Canadian. The wreckage has since been removed from the lake and police and aviation authorities are still investigating. Taupo Mayor David Trewavas said the region hosted the most parachute jumps of any in the southern hemisphere, and they are carried out by 'very experienced operators'. There were six crew and six passengers on board, they leapt out in tandem, while the pilot jumped out when it became obvious the plane was on its way down .","Scott Burnett, 28, was one of the 13 survivors who jumped from a plane before it nosedived into Lake Taupo on Wednesday .

"He has starred in everything from Avatar to Tintin, and worked with Hollywood legends such as Jackie Chan. Yet you are unlikely to have ever seen Reuben Langdon's face on screen - only his movements. The 39 year old Hollywood stuntman is one of the most successful motion capture artists in the world - and his been the star of some of the best selling computer games in the world. Scroll down for video . Langdon says his motion capture work is 'the evolution of makeup', and is rarely seen without the motion tracking makeup used in many hit films (left) The Los Angeles-based Actor began his career in Japan as a series regular acting in the Japanese superhero TV series 'B- FighterKabuto.' He later relocated to Hong Kong to work alongside the most recognizable names in action, including Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung. Eventually he made his way to Hollywood and worked regularly as an actor and stuntman on the international hit show 'The Power Rangers.' His motion capture performances have made it to the big screen in Steven Spielberg's and Peter Jackson's, The Adventures of Tintin, and James Cameron's Avatar, while he starred in the computer games Resident Evil and Devil May Cry. However, unlike Andy Serkis, who played Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and has become synonymous with  motion capture, Langdon has remained unseen. Reuben worked as a motion capture actor on James Cameron's Avatar, and appears as a Na'vi . Langdon provided the voice of Ken, a fighter in the hit game Street fighter . 'Just think of it as the evolution of makeup,' he told Grantland. He also revealed that working on computer games was usually more fraught than working on films. 'Usually the video-game guys are more secretive than the movie guys,' he said. Langdon's first motion capture  job was for a game called Resident Evil: Code Veronica for the now-defunct Sega system Dreamcast. To capture his moves, a system called magnetic capture was used. Performers wore a suit covered with receivers that were connected by wire to a central transmitter, which created data by measuring the distance between it and the receivers. The transmitter was basically a giant radio, blasting powerful frequencies to everyone in range. Langdon has worked with dozens of different motion capture systems . One of his most impressive roles is in the zombie 'movie' game The Last of Us, one of the most innovative games ever made. 'We could only be in the room for two or three hours,' Langdon said. 'You'd feel like someone punched you in the face, or like you just woke up.' One of his most impressive roles is in the zombie 'movie' game The Last of Us, one of the most innovative games ever made. Just some of Langdons roles include: . Film & TV: . Star Trek Continues, The Witches of O, Wizards of Waverly Place, The Green Hornet, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Night at the Museum 2, The Office, Dexter, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, CSI: Miami, Spider-Man 2, Power Rangers Time Force, Star Trek Continues . Computer games: . Lost Planet 2, Resident Evil: 5, The Bourne Conspiracy, Tao Fang, Star Wars: Jedi Knight II, Castlevania: Curse of Darkness, and Dead Rising. In Devil May Cry 3 and 4, Street Fighter, The Last of Us, Batman: Arkham Origins, Tomb Raider . He played so many characters that he no longer remembers them all. Langdon also specializes in death. 'I've done dramatic deaths, having them cough and choke, getting shot in the leg, the slow agony—I feel I've done every death possible,' he says.","Reuben Langdon has starred in everything from Avatar to Tintin .

"The wife of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has been forced to deny that she wore jeans to the funeral of a slain NYPD officer after furious cops lashed out and called her 'disrespectful.' Within hours of the funeral for Officer Wenjian Liu, pictures began to circulation on NYPD email chains and social media criticizing First Lady Chirlane McCray for reportedly wearing denim to the ceremony. One internet meme showed a picture of McCray in the outfit that read: 'Nothing says disrespect like rocking jeans to a cops (sic) funeral.' Scroll down for video . This meme began circulating after New York City First Lady Chirlane McCray was spotted wearing what looked like jeans at the funeral of Officer Wenjian Liu . The outfit was actually a 'respectful' blue-and-grey pantsuit, says City Hall and the designer who made the $600 clothing set . The criticism reached such a furor that City Hall issued a statement saying that the outfit was in fact a dark pants suit and was 'somber and appropriate.' Even McCray's favorite fashion designer, who sells the $600 pantsuit, has chimed in - telling the New York Daily News that she was actually wearing a dark rayon-polyester blend suit and that it wasn't denim. The criticism comes as tensions between City Hall and NYPD officers are at their highest in decades. Several officers turned their backs on the de Blasio when he spoke at Liu's funeral on Sunday - and dozens more turned their backs when the mayor spoke at the funeral for his partner Rafael Ramos last month. The head of the NYPD's largest police union has said de Blasio has 'blood on his hands' for the deaths of Ramos and Liu after they were gunned down by a madman who was upset about alleged police brutality cases. The mayor, whose children are biracial, said in a speech that he has talked to his son about avoiding racially profiled by the NYPD. He also expressed sympathy for protesters angry about this death last summer of State Island resident Eric Garner while he was being arrested. Arrests and citations have plummeted across the city and there are reported of an organized slowdown in work. McCray, a former lesbian who is a poet and a marketing executive, wore a pantsuit by Taiwanese-American designer  Anni Kuan to the funeral. Kuan admitted to the Daily News that the grey-white-and-blue patterns on the suit could be mistaken for denim. However, she says it was appropriate attire for the funeral. 'It's a very respectful suit you would wear to an important gathering,' she told the newspaper.","Chirlane McCray was criticized online by officers after she wore what appeared to be jeans to the funeral of Officer Wenjian Liu .

"Apple fans should be able to get their hands on the Apple Watch in March, but if you can't wait that long, a firm has created an online demo. The interactive watch is modelled on official images released by Apple, and lets people see how their messages, emails and homescreen will look and work. The demo also shows how push notifications will appear, and lets users control music on the virtual watch. The interactive watch (pictured) is modelled on official images released by Apple, and lets people see how their messages, emails and homescreen will look and work. Clicking the crown on the right of the watch brings up the homescreen, featuring a host of circular app icons . It was created by designers at Pipes, an app that lets people track news stories and trending topics. Clicking the crown on the right of the digital watch brings up the homescreen, featuring a host of circular app icons. Clicking the mouse and moving it to the left and right will swipe through pages on the watch's face. And clicking an individual icon will open that particular app. Reports suggest that supplies of the iPod Shuffle are dwindling. Apple's online store quotes a delivery time of between seven and 10 days. By comparison, other iPod products are shipped within 24 hours. Apple fan site 9to5Mac said Apple has warned its retail employees Shuffle supplies will be short for an 'unspecified period of time'. For example, clicking the iTunes icon opens a music player screen and lets users press play and pause, and change the volume. On the left-hand side of the demo are options that let users see how push notifications will appear, as well as how Apple's Glances feature works. Glances is a summary of the apps the user open the most, such as Facebook, the weather app, emails or maps. The feature is similar to Google Now, and on the physical version of the watch, Glances will be accessible by swiping up from the bottom of the watch face. In the demo, Glances shows the weather, news articles from Mashable, and Pipes' Top Stories menu.

Glances feature (picutred) shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping up from the bottom of the screen . So far Apple has refused to reveal exactly when it will be released, although a statement made to Apple employees suggests the release will be in 'the spring.' It has previously been claimed that suppliers were struggling to make enough screens and processors. Now 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman said Apple Store employees are set to be trained in February. 'One or two representatives from many Apple Stores in the United States, depending on store and market size, will be sent to Apple offices in either Cupertino, California or Austin, Texas to learn first-hand about the Watch,' he claimed. 'These training programs will take place between 9 February and 16 February.' The employees will then train the rest of their store's staff, it is believed. Unveiled on 9 September at Apple's iPhone 6 launch event, the Apple Watch is the company's foray into wearables. Samsung, LG, Sony, Motorola and Microsoft have already launched their own smartwatches, but Apple is expected to face unprecedented demand for its timepiece. Quanta, which is building the watch, has upped its number of workers from 2,000 to 10,000 and is ultimately aiming for 20,000. The initial round of shipments will be 3 to 5 million watches. Apple anticipates a total of 24 million watches to be shipped during 2015. During the announcement in September, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook didn't announce exactly when the watch would be available, but said it would go on sale 'early next year.' A 'source close to Apple' told The Information in November that the firm 'would be lucky to ship [the watch] before Valentine's Day'. Despite the range of impressive features unveiled by Mr Cook, there was something he failed to mention: battery life. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook (pictured) unveiled the watch at a launch event in September. Earlier this week, reports said Apple is 'finishing up' work on the watch’s software and it could go on sale in March . Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications . The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.' Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list. The crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen. Different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes, and force touches. The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom. Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications. It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone. Users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply, or have it transcribed to them. There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji. Siri also is built into the Apple Watch. The telling omission suggests the watch’s battery life will be the Achilles Heel of the device when it eventually does go on sale. Apple is said to be unhappy with the watch's battery life, and the long lead time before the $349 (£216) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it's released early next year. Most existing smartwatches on the market, such as Pebble and MetaWatch, tend to last up to a week on a single charge. The closest Cook came to talking about the battery life for the Watch was saying that users would ‘charge it at night.’ During an interview in Bloomberg Business Week, Apple's senior vice president of operations Jeff WIlliams said: 'We want to make the best product in the world. The watch has a completely new user interface (left), different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown' (right) presented by chief executive Tim Cook .

"David Cameron was accused of being a ‘chicken’ tonight after leaving plans for televised leader debates in tatters by refusing to take part. The Prime Minister said he would not sign up to a proposal from Britain’s main broadcasters for the TV debates unless it was changed to include the Green Party. Mr Cameron’s refusal put the plans in chaos with growing doubts over whether the debates would take place, although there is still the possibility they could take place without him. Scroll down for video . David Cameron (left),  Nick Clegg (centre) and former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, during the final live leaders' election debate, hosted by  the BBC in 2010 . Nigel Farage and Ed Miliband last night accused Mr Cameron of being ‘chicken’ and ‘running scared’, while Nick Clegg said the PM was 'making excuses'. The BBC, ITV, Sky News and Channel 4 had set-out plans that would have seen Ukip leader Mr Farage invited to take part in one debate also featuring David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg. The Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem leaders would have then taken part in a three-way discussion, before Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband went head-to-head in a final clash. When asked if it was correct that would not take part as it stands, Mr Cameron told ITV News: ‘Correct.’ Mr Miliband seized on the response to accuse Mr Cameron of dodging the debates. ‘The Prime Minister should be able to stand on his record and stop running scared,’ the Labour leader said. Mr Farage added: ‘Looks like Mr Cameron is a chicken running scared over the TV debates.’ Mr Cameron is not thought to have been happy with Mr Farage’s inclusion in the debate, while being eager for Green leader Natalie Bennett to be added to the line-up to split the left-wing vote.

Green Party leader Natalie Bennett (left) has insisted she should be included in televised debates alongside Nigel Farage (right) The move came as Ofcom ruled commercial television and radio broadcasters should give Ukip the same standing as Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats in their general election coverage for the first time. It will mean the Eurosceptic party will get extra party election broadcasts and increased coverage in new bulletins. Mr Miliband said: ‘It's not for the Prime Minister to choose who is in the TV debates. ‘What's now clear is that David Cameron is trying to find any excuse to stop these debates happening. The Prime Minister should stand on his record and stop running scared. ‘He wants to avoid these debates at all costs. ‘This is a Prime Minister who is running scared, trying to chicken out of these TV debates. ‘He shouldn't be doing it because he owes it to the people as do I to make sure these debates happen. ‘David Cameron doesn't have the right to block these debates or choose who is in them. But it is now clear that he is trying to do anything to stop these debates happening. The PM should be able to stand on his record and stop running scared.’ Mr Clegg told the Prime Minister to ‘stop making excuses’ and warned that voters will expect him to take part. The Deputy Prime Minister said: ‘Come on, David Cameron. The broadcasters have invited us, the public expect it, just say yes and stop making excuses.’ Mr Farage added: ‘Mr Cameron's comments about the TV debates show disdain for the British public who are very keen to hear from the major political party leaders - a point that Mr Cameron was not shy of making in 2010. ‘This proves that the Prime Minister is now a chicken, running scared, and running away from having an open and honest debate. ‘At a time when people seem increasingly disillusioned with British politics, it seems deeply irresponsible of Mr Cameron to hide away when this is obviously the most important general election for a generation. ‘It's unsurprising, given that Mr Cameron spent yesterday reiterating his support for the European Union, and the open border immigration policy imposed upon Britain by it.’","PM said he would refuse to take part with only Labour, Lib Dems and Ukip .

"A highly rated pitching prospect for the Yankees is recovering after a 'vicious attack' against him last month, his agent said Thursday. Ty Hensley's agent, Rob Martin, said in a statement to SBNation 'On behalf of Ty Hensley and his family, we are able to confirm that Ty was hospitalized after being brutally attacked and assaulted over the holidays in Oklahoma City. 'Ty was treated and released from the hospital and is presently recovering at home from the injuries he sustained after being knocked unconscious in this vicious attack. Ty and his family are grateful for all of the support, thoughts, and prayers he's received from friends, fans, and well-wishers. We respectfully request privacy during this difficult time.' Hensley and the alleged attacker, Anthony Morales, had a verbal dispute over money teams give signing players, a probable cause affidavit said. Incident: Ty Hensley, (left), and Anthony Morales, (right) were at a mutual acquaintance's house December 28. The two athletes had a verbal dispute over money teams give signing players, a probable cause affidavit says . Morales faces a felony assault charge, ESPN reported. Hensley's attorney Jacob Diesselhorst told the news outlet that his client suffered numerous wounds. 'Ty was hospitalized and is now home recovering,' Diesselhorst said. 'He has multiple injuries to his face, most notably a broken jaw in multiple places. 'Luckily, he has no neurological injuries of any kind. He is pretty beaten up. He is doing well now and recovering. Besides his facial injuries, we expect him to make a full recovery.' Diesselhorst told ESPN that Hensley and Morales had 'a friend-of-a-friend kind of deal.' On December 28 - the night of the alleged assault - Hensley went to a friend's house in The Village, Oklahoma, after going to a bar with some buddies, a probable cause affidavit obtained by NJ Advance Media said. Morales was noticed at the bar while the group headed out and invited to come along by a male friend of Hensley, the document said. Ty Hensley's attorney Jacob Diesselhorst says his client suffered numerous wounds including a broken jaw. Hensley is seen here playing in 2011 . Morales was a Weber State linebacker who the Carolina Panthers dropped earlier this year. Morales is seen playing against New England Patriots Taylor McCuller in this August 2014 file photo . A female witness told police she 'was in the laundry room [in the house when] she heard Mr. Hensley and the defendant  having an argument about the amount of money professional athletes are paid for signing with a professional team,'   the affidavit said. The witness heard noises in the living room - and came out to find Morales fleeing on foot with Hensley passed out, the document said. Hensley did not want to tell Morales about the money he received from the Yankees after being drafted in the first round, Diesselhorst told ESPN of his client's account. Hensley spoke to police one day after the alleged assault and said 'his jaw was broken in two places, he was missing a tooth, his mouth was wired shut, his right eye was black, and he had stitches from a 2"" laceration on his chin, and the right side of his head was swollen,' according to the probable cause affidavit. Morales was a Weber State linebacker who the Carolina Panthers dropped earlier this year, ESPN reported. Martin, Diesselhorst and the Yankees did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Ty Hensley is recovering after 'vicious attack' against him last month, his agent said Thursday .

"Dance Moms star Maddie Ziegler has spoken out to praise actor Shia LaBeouf after the pair starred together in a music video for Australian popstar Sia's new single Elastic Heart. While the 12-year-old reality star, who also appeared in the video for Sia's number one hit Chandelier, did not address the recent accusations about the 'inappropriate' nature of the pair's performance, she described the 28-year-old actor as her 'buddy' and went on to congratulate him on his emotionally-charged dancing. '[Shia] really did [fit into the family on set],' she told Cosmopolitan.com. Scroll down for video . 'We're buddies': 12-year-old Dance Moms star Maddie Ziegler has described the close friendship that she and Shia formed while on set . Inappropriate? The music video for Sia's new song Elastic Heart has caused upset with some who feel its content is too suggestive . 'Before we started the video Shia took me and my mom out to eat just to get to know each other because it'd be awkward just being like, ""Hey, let's dance together"" the first day, you know? 'It's kind of weird. So you have to build that bond.' The youngster, who is currently filming the fifth season of Lifetime reality hit Dance Moms, went on to add that, while she found Shia's method acting slightly bizarre, she was incredibly impressed with his overall performance - especially in light of his lack of professional dancing experience. 'I was confused [when they told me he was in the video], I was like, ""Wait, does he dance?"" And they were like, ""Ehhh, no.""' she explained. 'To be honest, he wasn't that bad at dancing... 'We had fun on set definitely, but when we got into it he got super serious. He was running around, he was punching the cage, and screaming and doing a lot of push-ups... I was a little intimidated but I understood.' Maddie added that she and Shia have stayed in touch following the performance, even revealing that the Transformers star sent her a text to congratulate her on a job well done. Dancing king: While Shia is understood to have had no professional dance training, Maddie admitted he 'wasn't that bad' at performing the choreography . Caged: In the video, Maddie and Shia play caged animals who begin fighting one another . The video, which sees Shia and Maddie take on the role of animals trapped in a large cage, while dancing around each other in a raw and dramatic way, has been slammed by some critics who say that its entire concept is wholly inappropriate. 'The Elastic Heart video would be magic if her dancing partner wasn't 30 years old, looked like a child predator and was a good dancer!' one Twitter user wrote about after seeing the clip. Another person on Facebook added: 'I understand that everyone thinks this is a piece of art, but I find it a little too sexual because why is a full grown man in a cage with a 12 year old and both wearing nude suits and making funny faces at each other. 'I find that disturbing.' Yesterday evening, Sia, 39, took to her Twitter account to apologize for any upset caused by the video, explaining that she had only hoped to create some 'emotional content'. 'Build a bond': Maddie told Cosmopolitan.com that Shia took her and her mother Melissa out for a meal before they began filming so that the pair could get to know each other . Close friends: It is the second time that Maddie has appeared in one of Sia's videos . 'All I can say is Maddie and Shia are two of the only actors I felt could play these two warring 'Sia' self states,' she explained. 'I apologize to those who feel triggered by Elastic Heart, my intention was to create some emotional content, not to upset anybody.' Meanwhile, fellow Dance Moms star Cathy Nesbitt-Stein has also spoken out against the video's content, according to TMZ. The stage mom and reality star claims she 'nearly threw up' while watching the video and went on to call the film 'vile'. She also lashed out at Maddie's mother: 'I am flabbergasted Melissa would go to the levels she is going to get her daughter famous.'","The reality star described the 28-year-old actor as her 'buddy'

"George Osborne has revealed he could pay for £7billion of promised Tory tax cuts by continuing his austerity programme after he has cleared the deficit. The Chancellor is planning to run a £23billion surplus in 2018/19 - three years after the election. Mr Osborne today revealed he could use the surplus to raise the personal tax threshold to £12,500 and the point at which the 40p higher rate starts to £50,000. The Chancellor is planning to run a £23billion surplus in 2018/19 - three years after the election - which could pay for David Cameron's £7billion tax cut . The Chancellor said he ‘completely’ agreed with former education secretary Michael Gove, who claimed earlier this week that the money could come from the surplus predicted by the Office for Budget Responsibility. In comments which appeared to suggest that the cuts may not come until the final year of the next Parliament, Tory Chief Whip Mr Gove told BBC2's Newsnight that the OBR was predicting a surplus of £23 billion by 2019/20 under Tory plans. He said: ‘Within that, we can afford to have tax cuts. If you've got £23 billion spare, left over, then you can take £7 billion out of that for tax cuts.’ Speaking to business leaders in Manchester as part of his tour of the north-west with Mr Cameron, the Chancellor said: ‘What Michael Gove is saying - and I completely agree with him - is the spending plans we have set out show you can deliver a surplus. ‘I think it is perfectly consistent to have spending plans that deliver the surplus, that reduce the national debt and to deliver those tax cuts that we have promised the British people because they are all part of the long-term economic plan. ‘The forecast surplus is £23 billion by the end of this decade. Those spending plans deliver economic security and by having a surplus you can not only eliminate your deficit but you can start to get your debt down. ‘Our national debt is too high. It went up a lot in the economic crisis because we had a high deficit and we kept adding to that debt. That leaves the UK exposed to the next shock.’ In June 2010, the Office for Budget for Responsibility predicted that in 2014-15 borrowing would fall to just £37billion, but it has remained high at around £100billion and is not expected to return a surplus until 2018-19 . With Britain borrowing billions every year, the total net public debt is set to top £1.5trillion before the end of the decade . In that context he said it was a ‘sensible approach’ to put economic security and stability first as without that none of the economic plan would work. But he added: ‘Consistent with that and at the same time we can also deliver tax cuts for working people. This is not a bolt-on to our plan. This is also central to our plans so that in this country you are incentivised to work, you are rewarded for your hard work. ‘In this Parliament we have managed to achieve £9 billion of income tax reductions by increasing the tax-free personal allowance whilst cutting the deficit in half and delivering economic stability again to our country. ‘We have shown you can do it, we have got the spending plans that show you can manage the public finances and deliver that surplus. ‘We must learn the lesson that you should fix the roof when the sun is shining. The economy will, by the latter part of this decade, have been growing for seven or eight years. If you are not using that period to be paying down your debts, when are you paying down your debts?’ This was in contrast, he went on, to Labour who he said did not want to reduce the national debt. He added: ‘They say they will run a deficit forever. I say that is repeating the mistakes of the past, that is borrowing against our country's future and our children's future. It leaves our country exposed, as it was when the financial crash happened.’","Chancellor planning to run £23bn surplus in 2018/19 after clearing deficit .

"A former cult member has spoken out to warn others of a religious sect that she says has robbed 14 years of her life. Alison Forden says she escaped from the Magnificat Meal Movement (MMM) which is currently based at a country home in Helidon, southeast Queensland. The woman behind MMM is Debra Geileskey who founded the group in 1986 and claims to hear voices and visions of angels, Virgin Mary and Jesus. Ms Forden told A Current Affair on Thursday night that she was 'brainwashed' by the cult which not only cost her thousands of dollars but also ruined her life and the lives of her children. Scroll down for video . Alison Forden says she escaped from the Magnificat Meal Movement (MMM), warning others of the religious sect that she says has robbed 14 years of her life . Hundreds of members are part of the the religious sect which was founded in 1986 . The woman behind MMM is Debra Geileskey, who claims that she can hear voices and visions of angels, Virgin Mary and Jesus . The Queensland mother joined MMM after her marriage broke down and admits that it took her awhile to finally come to her senses. 'I was brainwashed,' Ms Forden told A Current Affair. 'I had no connection with the outside world. 'I was encouraged not to watch TV, not to read news, not to buy magazines.' Ms Forden says all members were told to give 10 per cent of their income, while also supporting other money-making schemes led by Ms Geileskey. 'I would hate to do the figures because it would be thousands but also my children's lives they have been affected and no amount of money would ever restore that,' Ms Forden said. 'I can't believe I actually went along with everything that was told to me and I didn't question it earlier. 'I can't believe I was sucked by this place because it really is a cult.'

Ms Forden's mother, Rosemary, was also living at the country home and was required to pay rent. She says she was constantly monitored by Ms Geileskey. 'You always had to ask or tell where you were going,' she told A Current Affair. While Ms Geileskey now lives overseas, Ms Forden believes the cult leader still operates MMM and has 100s of followers visiting or living at the Queensland home. Raphael Aron from Cult Counselling Australia told A Current Affair 'concerns need to be expressed for any religion that pushes a particular product or particular commodity'. 'If people feel a sense of submissiveness, a sense of obligation, a sense of belonging and also the fact that if they are going to leave they may end up in not a very good place, that's when I talk about not having the freedom to go,' he said. While Ms Forden rebuilds her life, she still remains worried about the other lives that may be destroyed by Ms Geileskey. 'She's lying to a group of people, misleading them. How many homes will be lost? How many marriages will be wrecked? How many people will have their lives destroyed?' Ms Forden said.

"Vivica A. Fox has defended Bill Cosby in light of his mounting rape allegations, saying: 'The man I met was nothing like the man they are describing.' The actress joined a growing number of Cosby Show alumni who have come to the embattled comedian's defense as she appeared on The Meredith Vieira Show, which will air on Thursday. Fox, 50, recalled how she worked with the actor - who has been accused of drugging and sexually assaulting more than two dozen women - on 'Cosby' for an episode in 1999. 'I worked on the Cosby show and was honored to do the show, and... the man I met was nothing like the man they are describing,' she said. Scroll down for videos . Defense: Actress Vivica A. Fox told Meredith Vieira that she stands by Bill Cosby, whom she called 'kind' Support: She said when she worked with Cosby in the 90s, she witnessed nothing inappropriate . 'He was nice, kind. There was no sexual overtones or anything so I defend him and I stand by him as well, too.' Vieira asked her about Cosby after her fellow Celebrity Apprentice teammate, Keshia Knight Pulliam, who played Rudy on the Cosby Show, was quizzed about the scandal this week. 'I wasn't there,' Pulliam told the Today show on Monday. 'No one was there expect for the two people to know exactly what happened. All I can speak to is the man that I know and I love.' Also in recent days, Phylicia Rashad, who played his on-screen wife, Clair Huxtable, came to his defense. She was initially reported to have said to 'forget these women', but later explained that she does not think the discussion should be about the women, it should be about Cosby's damaged legacy. Back to work: On Wednesday night, Cosby was met with empty seats and hecklers as he returned to the stage for the first time in 2015 (pictured). He performed a stand up show in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada . 'It's difficult for me to watch this legacy be erased, as if [it] never happened,' she told ABC. She said she never saw anything inappropriate while they worked together and that Cosby's wife, Camille, would often visit the set, so when she heard the first allegations against him, she was suspicious. 'My initial reaction to the allegations was, ""Hmm someone has a vested interest in preventing Cosby's return to network television"",' she said. Although she has not spoken to him recently, she said that no doubt the accusations have 'not been easy' for Cosby. 'I did talk to him towards the beginning of all of this and his comment was the internet has given some anonymous people a very loud voice,' she said. On-screen family: Earlier this week, Keshia Knight Pulliam, who played Rudy on the Cosby Show, defended Cosby, saying she was unable to pass judgment on the accusations because she was not there . Suspicious: His on-screen wife Phylicia Rashad, pictured on Nightline, also spoke out in his defense and said she believes the accusations are an orchestrated plan to keep him off network television . Cosby's career unraveled after his accusers came forward, with a TV project halted and at least 10 stand-up comedy tour performances canceled or indefinitely postponed. The 77-year-old, who has been accused of drugging or sexual abuse by more than 20 women, including models Janice Dickinson and Beverly Johnson, has denied the allegations. On Wednesday, he returned to the stage in Ontario for his first show since November - and was met with empty seats and a sea of protesters brandishing signs reading: 'Rape is no joke.' The three performances in Canada come after Cosby saw at least 10 performances get canceled on his North American tour. He next appears at the Budweiser Gardens in London, Ontario, on Thursday and at the Hamilton Place Theatre in Hamilton, Ontario, on Friday.

"Ever wanted to eat whatever you want without worrying about calories? It may sound too good to be true but if one man has his way, this could be the future of food. Project Nourished is a  gastronomic virtual reality experiment using Oculus Rift headsets, cutlery with sensors, low-calorie foods and aromatic diffusers to mimic the taste of the real thing. If the experiment proves successful, being prevented from eating whatever you like due to food allergies and dietary restrictions will become a thing of the past. Project Nourished uses virtual reality headsets and low calorie food to mimic steak, pie and lasagne . The brainchild of Los-Angeles based Kokiri Lab, the project was inspired by a scene in the film Hook, in which Peter Pan learns to use his imagination to see food on a table that appears empty at first. So successful have experiments been, Jinsoo An, 30, the founder of Kokiri Lab believes Project Nourished could pioneer a new way of eating. ‘I've been disappointed by the fact that our way of eating hasn't changed much since the beginning of time and I wanted others to realise that they don't have to follow the status quo,’ he told MailOnline. ‘I also want to make it clear that I don't want this to replace the way we consume food. It's simply another alternative.’ An alternative to the way we eat, Project Nourished will let you eat wherever you want to, be it in the middle of a desert (pictured) or standing in the street of a bustling city full of people and moving objects . Motion and food detection sensor work with aromatic diffusers to mimic a broad spectrum of food . Currently in its early stages, the experiment is a complete sensory experience that uses virtual reality headsets and special cutlery with sensors to create environments based on real locations. This is then combined with low-calorie foods derived from agar, konjac jelly and gum Arabic, which mimic foods such as steak, lasagne, pies and sushi. Aromatic diffusions also come into play, making it possible to smell your virtual steak before you tuck into it. ‘We've began prototyping the object detection sensor for chopsticks and fork, as well as the virtual reality software using Unity and Oculus Rift,’ Mr An explained. ‘Our first demo will feature an environment based a fictional place that is set in the past and future of Tokyo. You'll be able to eat in the middle of the bustling city full of people and moving objects. ‘We've also been experimenting with water to agar ratio and layering thin sheets of agar (like lasagna) to achieve different textures of the virtual foods.’ Virtual sushi, steak and pie are made from low-calorie gum Arabic, konjac jelly and agar . Project Nourished was inspired by a scene in the film Hook in which Peter Pan learns to use his imagination to see foods on a table that seems to be completely empty at first . Founder of Kokiri Lab, Jinsoo An (pictured) believes the experiment could pioneer a new way of eating . On the menu and currently being trialled are dishes such as sushi, steak, lasagne and pie. ‘So far, we've been focusing our efforts on sushi, steak, lasagna and pie since they have relatively simple geometry and large flat surface areas -- which means they're easier to detect using our sensors,’ Mr An continued. ‘The foods that have irregular shapes, have many chunks and fall apart easily will be the hardest to mimic. 'Most likely, we will stay away from foods like rice pudding, sweet and sour chicken, and salad.’ He hopes to begin further testing later this year. ‘We expect to have our first alpha sometime in the middle of the year. If we can get more funding soon, we can probably have it sooner. 'Currently, I'm funding it out of my own pocket, so there are some challenges.’","Project Nourished uses Oculus Rift headsets and cutlery with sensors .

"The devastating invasion of Native American land that bulldozed the indigenous population into relative insignificance has been visualized in a striking time-lapse map. Between 1776 and 1887, white conquerors razed across 1.5 billion acres of occupied land, claiming it for their own. By 1800, Native Americans only accounted for 15 per cent of the nation, compared to the settlers' 85. Video provided by Claudio Saunt, eHistory.org, University of Georgia . How it started: The settlers started on the East Coast and headed west through the center, the video shows . Just the beginning: Within 30 years, almost 200 million acres had been seized from the indigenous people . A survey taken in 1900 showed the Indians to make up just 0.5 per cent of the United States population. It is a history that many claim to be ignored by the majority of non-indigenous Americans, who focus on the lives lost during the Civil War and European atrocities of the 19th century. Attempting to bring the scale of land and lives lost, Dr Claudio Saunt, of the University of Georgia, created a YouTube video mapping the dispossession. 'Few [Americans] can recall the details and even fewer think that those events are central to US history,' Dr Saunt wrote in an accompanying article for Aeon magazine. The video was put together by University of Georgia professor Dr Claudio Saunt to promote awareness . Gradual: In the first 100 years, the settlers largely swept the east and south as they focused on other issues . 'Their tenuous grasp of the subject is regrettable ... and deplorable.' The video shows how settlers started their onslaught in 1776 from the East Coast and through the center - Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Arkansas. It was a gradual process: by 1860, there was still a significant faction of indigenous land across the west half of the country. In 20 years, that was almost entirely annihilated. Dr Saunt explains the 'rapid and murderous' sweep by quoting California's first governor John Sutter: . 'That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between races, until the Indian race becomes extinct, must be expected,' Sutter said in 1851. East gone: In the years leading up to the Civil War, virtually the entire east half of America was occupied . Reservations: Half way through the 19th century we start to see the first reservations popping up . The onslaught: After the civil war was a 'rapid and murderous' rampage across the West Coast . Plans: After the settlers discovered California's gold, officials vowed to stop at nothing to control the land . 'Europe’s 20th century atrocities are easier for most people to envision than the dispossession of Native Americans,' Dr Saunt writes. 'Accounts of those episodes describe the victims as men, women and children. 'By contrast, the language used to chronicle the dispossession of native peoples – ""Indian"", ""chief"", ""warrior"", ""tribe"", ""squaw"" (as native women used to be called) – conjures up crude stereotypes.' In the 21st century, the canvas is being stretched for a change of perspective. Now, more than one per cent of Americans identify as indigenous - 'an increase,' Dr Saunt writes, 'that reflects not a substantive demographic shift but a newfound willingness and desire to identify as indigenous.' Virtually obliterated: By 1887, 1.5 billion acres of land had been taken and the population vastly diminished . In 2010, the map of America's reservations had since diminished, though more identify as indigenous now . While the Constitution recognizes reservations as possessing a nationhood status and inrehent powers of self-government, Dr Saunt calls for more universities to teach indigenous history as a matter of course. He concludes: 'A history that glosses over the conquest of the continent is partial, in both senses of the word. 'It misleads people about the past and misinforms their debates about the present. 'In charting a course for the future, Americans would do well to put the dispossession of native peoples back on the map.'","Settlers conquered 1.5 billion acres between 1776 and 1887 from Indians .

"It was a day Bella Davison's parents feared they would never see - their daughter home for the first time. The six-month-old was born a week before the legal abortion limit at only 23 weeks into her mother's pregnancy, weighing just over 1lb - the same as a bag of sugar. Doctors are advised not to resuscitate babies born before 23 weeks and her parents, Vicky Jackson and Graeme Davison, an electrician, were told by doctors to prepare for the worst. But their daughter fought hard to survive and is now thriving. Today she left hospital after spending her entire life under the care of medics at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary. Vicky Jackson, 30, of Morpeth Northumberland (right), was thrilled to take her baby daughter Bella (left), now six months old, home today. Bella was born at 23 weeks old, a week before the legal abortion limit . When Bella was born weighing just over 1lb, the same as a bag of sugar (pictured top) doctors told her parents to fear the worst. But Bella survived and is now thriving, weighing a healthy  12lb 11oz (bottom) Ms Jackson, 30, of Morpeth, Northumberland, said: 'It was very emotional to bring Bella home as there was a time when we thought this might not happen. 'The day after Bella was born we were told she would not survive the night but she did and now she is home - it's amazing. 'It is great to see how well Bella's doing as she looks like any other baby, and you would not know that she was premature, she is just a little miracle. Ms Jackson is now calling for the abortion limit to be lowered. She said: 'I think the abortion limit should be significantly lowered to 10 weeks unless there is a medical reason. 'Bella shows that babies can survive at 23 weeks old if they are given a fighting chance. 'More premature babies are surviving all the time due to advances in medical treatment.' Earlier this week MailOnline reported on the story of baby Jet Morris, who was born prematurely at 25 weeks weighing just 1.4lbs - having survived for five weeks in the womb after his mother's waters broke. Doctors had advised mother Mhairi Morris, 34 that the pregnancy was 'non- viable - and prepared her for a termination. But she and husband Paul defied doctors' advice - and believe had it not been for their determination, Jett - who is thriving and recently celebrated his first birthday - would not be here today. Bella and her twin sister Sophia were born by Caesarean section at Wansbeck General Hospital, four months before their due date. But Sophia suffered complications and doctors were unable to save her. Ms Jackson said: 'We are devastated that Sophia did not make it. Ms Jackson said: 'Bella shows that babies can survive at 23 weeks old if they are given a fighting chance.' She is pictured here in hospital, where she spent the first six months of her life . Bella's plight has attracted followers from around the world, after her mother started a blog about her daughter's fight for life. Ms Jackson has received messages of support from as far away as America . 'But we are very lucky that Bella is here with us as there was a chance that we would not have either of our daughters. 'The last time Bella was weighed she was 12lb 11oz and she's doing well.' 'Bella 100 per cent wanted to be here and she has just dealt with everything, she has such a strong little character.' Bella will continue to be regularly seen by nurses and she will be monitored by experts to see if she is developing as expected. There is a possibility that she may have mild cerebral palsy and slight developmental problems following a bleed to her brain at just one day old. Ms Jackson said: 'Like any first-time parent, I am a little nervous having her home and I'm constantly watching her to check that she's OK. 'But it's very exciting and I'm used to sleepless nights as I've been staying with Bella in hospital.' Bella's plight has attracted followers from around the world, after her mother started a blog about her daughter's fight for life. Her parents Graeme Davison, 38 (left) and Vicky Jackson, 30 (right) are now campaigning for the abortion limit to be lowered. The couple are pictured with Bella in their home for the first time . Ms Jackson's Facebook posts about her Beautiful Bella and life on the Special Care Baby Unit was started initially to give family and friends daily updates on her daughter's condition as her life hung in the balance. But messages of support have come from across the Atlantic as far away as Texas, America. Ms Jackson and Mr Davison, 38, both former students at King Edward VI school in Morpeth, said the online support they have received had been a great source of strength. 'Some of the messages we get from people around the world are really inspirational,' said Ms Jackson. 'Some of them are from people who have been or are going through similar situations.' The couple pledged to raise vital funds for Tiny Lives to thank the charity for its help and support. A charity night at Gala Bingo in Cramlington, Northumberland, helped to raise more than £200. 'We wanted to raise money for Tiny Lives to say thank you for all their help, but also to try and help save the lives of more premature babies,' said Ms Jackson. 'They fund research and equipment but also facilities for the families and support with financial costs like the daily hospital parking charges.'

"Shaker Aamer has been detained at the US detention facility without trial or charge since 2002 . Amnesty International today launches a major petition demanding the release of Shaker Aamer. The global human rights organisation said the ‘terrible farce’ of his continued detention had ‘gone on too long’. The petition launch coincides with the 13th anniversary of the opening of the infamous US detention facility in Cuba on Sunday. In almost all that time, Mr Aamer, who has resident status in Britain and whose British wife and children live in South London, has been held in Guantanamo without charge. The new petition calls for Mr Aamer to be released and returned to the UK ‘without delay’, and for an immediate investigation into his allegations of torture and other ill-treatment. Supporters of the campaign for his release have called on David Cameron to raise the issue with President Obama in talks expected later this month. Downing Street say the case has been raised at the ‘highest levels’. Amnesty International UK Director Kate Allen said: ‘Since the publication of the report into CIA torture there’s been renewed interest in Shaker’s plight, and not before time. ‘It’s been 13 shameful years since the US authorities took those first orange-jumpsuited detainees to Guantánamo, and Shaker’s been there almost for the duration. Scroll down for video . Mr Aamer with two of his children, son Michael and daughter Johninh. Amnesty International said the 'farce' of his detention at Guantanamo has 'gone on too long' and launched a petition today demanding his release . ‘We need the UK government to definitively establish what the blockage over his release actually is - this terrible farce has gone on long enough. ‘Messrs Cameron and Obama need to put the relevant officials in a room and sort out the means of releasing Shaker without delay - in days, not weeks.’ Recent weeks have seen a flurry of releases from Guantanamo, raising new hope that Mr Aamer’s detention may soon come to an end. Five former detainees were sent to Kazakhstan at the end of December. President Obama pledged to close Guantanamo when he first campaigned for election to the White House, and there is hope it may yet be emptied by the time he leaves the White House at the end of next year. Mr Aamer has twice been cleared for transfer from the camp, the first time in 2007 and again two years later. His health has deteriorated and last year he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. The 46-year-old father of four was first transferred to Guantanamo on 14 February 2002, after he was detained in Afghanistan and transferred to the custody of the American government.

They say he is a terrorist who was a close ally of Osama bin Laden, a claim he strenuously denies. Joanne MacInnes, campaign director of ‘We Stand With Shaker’ said: ‘We are delighted that Amnesty has launched this timely petition for Shaker Aamer, which boosts the growing campaign momentum and marks the 13th year of the opening of Guantanamo prison. ‘Shaker is one of seven non-Yemen detainees cleared for release and so doesn't need to be found a host country - and therefore should be amongst the first and easiest to bring home. ‘If Shaker is indeed David Cameron's top priority, as we are so often told, then I see no reason why Shaker shouldn't be on the next plane home. ‘If that's not happening can we please be offered an explanation as to why he isn't amongst the very next releases. ‘Shaker's family is owed an explanation as to why they cannot get him home. The British Government has a non-negotiable responsibility to secure the return of Mr Aamer, given his status as a legal British resident.’ The petition can be found on the Amnesty International website.

"It's not often that a king comes face-to-face with an emperor but that is exactly what happened when the Netherland's King Willem-Alexander was welcomed to Japan by the country's Emperor Akhito. The Dutch royals are beginning a six-day tour of the country, and were greeted by an honour guard as they arrived in the Japanese capital. After a visit to a design museum and a gorgeous oriental garden, the two finished their first day with a lavish state banquet thrown in their honour. Scroll down for video . Dazzling: Maxima wore a royal sash over her golden bejeweled gown and a large bow shaped brooch . Delighted: The Queen seemed thrilled to be attending the dinner in Japan's capital city . Elegant: Queen Maxima sipped on her drink as she enjoyed the state banquet . Engaging: The Dutch royal seemed engrossed in conversation with Emperor Akihito . Sumptuous: The Dutch royals are greeted by their Japanese counterparts ahead of a state dinner . Glittering: Maxima opted for an opulent gold gown which she wore with her royal sash and tiara . Big welcome: The Dutch royals were greeted by Emperor Akhito and Empress Michiko at the Imperial Palace . But despite the best efforts of the two monarchs, it was Queen Maxima who commanded most of the attention - courtesy of a chic silk dress and hat in patriotic orange, and later, a glittering gold gown. Also on hand to welcome the Dutch monarch and his wife was Empress Michiko, 80, who, when she married Emperor Akhito on the 10th April 1959, became the first commoner ever to marry into the Japanese royal family. After exchanging handshakes on the red carpet, Akhito, 80, joined his Dutch counterparts for a flag raising ceremony and official public welcome. Glowing: The Dutch royal appeared to be in good spirits during the evening . Bejeweled: Queen Maxima commanded most of the attention at the dinner - courtesy of a glittering gold gown . Later, the Dutch couple were taken to visit a design museum, with Queen Maxima, ever the fashion fan, proving particularly interested in the style offerings on show. An exhausting day then ended with a sumptuous state banquet, which saw the couple arrive in full royal regalia for their dinner with the Imperial couple at the Palace. Warm: The two couples exchanged kisses as they were introduced to one another . Ceremony: The two couples then took part in an official welcome ceremony which saw both flags raised . Making an entrance: Queen Maxima, 43, was glamorous in a patriotic orange silk dress and hat . Formal: King Willem-Alexander looked sombre as he walked with Emperor Akhito during the ceremony . Big event: The Dutch royal couple are beginning a six-day tour of the Far Eastern nation . Solemn: Although sombre during the ceremony, Maxima and Michiko appeared to enjoy each other's company . Japan boasts the oldest continual hereditary monarchy in the world, beginning with Emperor Jimmu who reigned from 660 BC. Since then, 125 emperors have come and gone, with the most recent, Hirohito, famous for being head of state during the Second World War. Unlike other members of the Japanese administration, he was not charged with war crimes and instead oversaw Japan's rebirth as a constitutional monarchy - a process continued by his son, Akhito. Unlike their Japanese counterparts, who have sat on the Chrysanthemum Throne since 1990 following the death of Emperor Hirohito, the Dutch royals are among the newest - and youngest - monarchs in the world. Willem-Alexander, 47, was one of the beneficiaries of a spate of abdications in 2013 which saw his mother Queen Beatrix step down along with King Albert II of Belgium and Pope Benedict XVI. Only Felipe and Letizia of Spain have been on the throne for a shorter period of time, with the two crowned in June following the abdication of King Juan-Carlos. But while Letizia and Felipe's reign has so far gone smoothly, Maxima and her husband have had a rougher ride in recent months thanks in part to the MH17 tragedy, which left the Netherlands reeling. Nevertheless, since the crash, the popularity of the Argentina-born Dutch Queen has soared thanks to her tireless work on behalf of the MH17 families. She has also attended some of the repatriation ceremonies and was seen sobbing from her perch beside Prime Minister Mark Rutte as the first flight arrived back on Dutch soil. Salute: During the ceremony, the royal flags of both countries were raised by the guard of honour . Stylish: Maxima pulled out all the stops for her meeting with Empress Michiko and opted for patriotic orange . High-powered: During the meeting, Willem-Alexander spoke to his Japanese counterpart, Emperor Akhito . Tour: After the meeting with the Japanese royals, the Dutch couple were taken to a design museum . More recently, the Dutch royals have found themselves cheered to the rafters during public appearances, most notably when they appeared on the balcony of the Noordeinde Palace in the Hague on Prinsjesdag [Prince's Day], along with the former Queen Beatrix, 76 . Maxima, 43, has also become a familiar sight at charity events around the Netherlands, with her most recent outing being at a symposium organised by women's rights activists in Amsterdam, which celebrated the 40th birthday of a Dutch law banning domestic violence. With her husband, she also enjoyed a successful trip to New York last month, where she was seen chatting with fellow queen Letizia during a meeting of the UN General Assembly. The pair were reiunited for the second time in a month two weeks ago, when the Spanish royals paid their Dutch counterparts a friendly visit in The Hague. Entertaining: The couple appeared to enjoy their time at the museum, Maxima in particular . What's this?

"Passengers on a new flight planned between Vienna and Bratislava will barely have time to open the inflight magazine and order hot drink between take-off and landing. FlyNiki, a low-cost Austrian airline, has announced plans for what it claims is the world’s shortest international flight – a 30-mile trip between the Austrian and Slovakian capitals. But baring in mind that the journey takes just an hour by car and even less by train - one wonders if it's worth the hassle of faffing around in immigration and check-in.

"Film legend: Hong Kong tycoon Run Run Shaw at an awards ceremony in 2010. He died at home aged 107 . Hong Kong media mogul Sir Run Run Shaw, who created an empire in Asia spanning movies to television, died on Tuesday at the age of 106, his company said. Shaw died peacefully at his home in Hong Kong, surrounded by his family, his company, Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) , said in a statement. One of Hong Kong cinema's defining figures, Shaw popularised Chinese kung fu films in the West and helped turn the former British colony into a 'Hollywood East' over an 80-year career. He set up Hong Kong's biggest free-to-air . television operator, TVB, in 1967 and served as its executive chairman . until 2011, helping to shape the city's media culture. 'He has contributed greatly to TVB. Thanks to his wise leadership, TVB has its status today after 46 years,' said TVB Executive Chairman Norman Leung. English film director Edgar Wright, who . helmed Hot Fuzz and Shaun Of The Dead, tweeted: 'Rest In Peace Sir Run . Run Shaw. 106 years. What a life.' Glamorous: The tycoon with actresses Toby Chan and Sammi Cheung at an anniversary party for TVB, the TV station he oversaw . A passionate film-lover from an early age, legend has it that Shaw first cut his teeth in the business by distributing film reels on a bicycle to rural cinemas in Singapore and Malaysia, giving poignancy to his name 'Run Run'. He started out helping his elder brothers . Runje, Runde and Runme set up a film studio in Shanghai in 1925. The . brothers later moved into Hong Kong - making and distributing films to a . chain of around 100 cinemas spread across other Asian markets such as . Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. Sir Run Run Shaw in London with his wife and daughter, after receiving  a Knighthood from the Queen in 1978 . Shaw eventually split from his brothers to set up his own studio in the 1950s dubbed the dream factory, which ushered in a golden era of Hong Kong film-making. A Miss Hong Kong Pageant 2005 contestant poses with Sir Run Run Shaw, veteran producer and founder of Shaw Brothers Studio . The Shaw studio produced about a thousand titles, including melodramas, historical epics and kung fu classics like 'The One-armed Swordsman' - helping to redefine genres and lure new cinema-goers not only in Hong Kong and Asia, but in the West. Shaw also invested in a number of co-productions, most notably the Ridley Scott classic, 'Blade Runner', starring Harrison Ford, in 1982. The studio also pioneered so-called 'Wuxia' or 'martial hero' genre films - which had highly choreographed fight scenes. Ang Lee's Oscar-winning 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a striking modern example of the genre. The Shaw influence is also evident in the films of kung fu legend Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan and director, writer, actor and producer John Woo. It has also heavily influenced the work of Oscar-winning director Quentin Tarantino, most notably in the Kill Bill films. While Shaw was famed for his business acumen and nose for spotting and grooming new talent, he famously turned away a brash, young actor who came to see him in the 1960s. This spurned man, martial arts legend Bruce Lee, later teamed up with Raymond Chow, a former Shaw deputy-turned-rival, to make 'The Big Boss' in 1971, propelling him to stardom. In 1980, Shaw focused on television, becoming the chairman of TVB, which grew into a successful television and entertainment empire that remains a deep influence on popular culture in Hong Kong and overseas Chinese communities. In 2011, Shaw sold his entire 26 per cent stake in TVB to a consortium for HK$6.26 billion (£492million). He retired as chairman at the end of that year after holding the post for 30 years and was appointed chairman emeritus. The Chinese movie maker invested in the Ridley Scott classic, 'Blade Runner', starring Harrison Ford - one of the most influential films ever made . Writer-director Quentin Tarantino is a keen fan of the Hong Kong cinema Sir Run Run Shaw popularised across the world. Its influence can be keenly felt in films like Kill Bill . Shaw is also a noted philanthropist, having donated millions to charity through his Shaw Foundation, mostly to causes in China. Hong Kong media reported that he donated more than £453m to the mainland over the years, mostly in the field of education. Many hospital and school buildings in Hong Kong are named after him. The tycoon also ran the so-called Shaw prize, sometimes referred to as Asia's answer to the Nobels, which rewards excellence in maths, astronomy and science, with a prize of £600,000 for each laureate. 'Wuxia' martial arts flims are now popular throughout the world, as shown by the success of films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon . He was knighted by the Queen in 1977 and received the Grand Bauhinia Medal from the Hong Kong government in 1998. Popularly known as 'Luk Suk' or 'Sixth Uncle', Shaw was born in 1907, the sixth child of a well-to-do family in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo. Shaw married twice. His first wife died in 1987. He is survived by his current wife, Mona Fong, two sons and two daughters.

"Tony Abbott has launched a blistering attack on the head of Australia's human rights watchdog, calling into question her judgement. The prime minister labelled as 'pretty bizarre' a ruling by Human Rights Commission president Gillian Triggs that recommended the release from detention of a Papuan refugee who killed his de facto wife in 2000. Ms Triggs also recommended John Basikbasik receive $350,000 in compensation for his arbitrary detention since 2007. Tony Abbott has launched a blistering attack on the head of Australia's human rights watchdog, calling into question her judgement . Successive immigration ministers have opted to leave Basikbasik in detention rather than release him into the community. Mr Abbott said the ruling by Dr Triggs showed 'extremely questionable' judgment. 'Decisions like this do, I think, tend to shake people's confidence in institutions like the Human Rights Commission,' he told reporters in Adelaide on Thursday. When asked whether he continued to have confidence in Dr Triggs, the prime minister said: 'I'm not going to go into that.' The prime minister labelled as 'pretty bizarre' a ruling by Human Rights Commission president Gillian Triggs that recommended the release from detention of a Papuan refugee who killed his de facto wife in 2000 . Dr Triggs, a Labor appointee, ends her role in June 2017. In a report published late in 2014, Dr Triggs said successive ministers had breached Basikbasik's human rights by keeping him in detention after his seven-year manslaughter sentence had concluded. Because he is a genuine refugee, Basikbasik cannot be deported back to Indonesia. He has a history of violent crimes and breaching bail conditions that dates back to 1985 when he arrived in Australia by canoe. Ms Triggs also recommended John Basikbasik receive $350,000 in compensation for his arbitrary detention since 2007 . Former immigration minister Scott Morrison, who refused Basikbasik's request for a bridging visa in 2013, was dismissive of Dr Triggs. She seemed to be 'always arguing for a fair go for those who have forfeited that right by their own behaviour'. 'There seems to be no consequences for one's actions in the system she seems to believe in,' the now social services minister told The Australian. His successor, Peter Dutton, said suggestions 'wife killers should be released back into the community with a cheque from the taxpayer are so far removed from the public view, it is just offensive'. Former Labor immigration minister Tony Burke would not be drawn into criticism of Dr Triggs, telling reporters she was principled and fearless. He also saw her as someone who acted with complete probity. Mr Burke defended his own role in keeping John Basikbasik in detention, saying he was very confident he had acted according to law. So too did Chris Bowen, another Labor immigration minister, who said he had no regrets about denying Basikbasik a bridging visa in 2012. The government has rejected a number of other decisions by Dr Triggs in recent months. One involved paying $300,000 in compensation to a US-born convicted fraudster whom the government deported after he swindled $644,000 from taxpayers and banks.

"Justin Robert Muoio is accused of pimping out a pregnant woman, 23, on Craigslist for $200 a time . A man who allegedly pimped out a pregnant women to 'fetish' clients on Craigslist for $200 a time has been charged with false imprisonment. Justin Robert Muoio, 32, is accused of posting adverts for the woman on Craigslist as a 'pregnant prostitute' for 'fetish clientele'. The 23-year-old woman, who says she was forced to have sex with strangers for two months of her pregnancy in 2013, is also alleged to have been kept inside Muoio's apartment on the outskirts of Miami. Muoio was arrested in August 2014 after a 'heated altercation' with the woman, who then tried to leave the apartment but was locked in. She was trapped inside for 90 minutes until Muoio's mother Louise Henig-Muoio, 65, went outside briefly, the Miami Herald reported. But the woman later told Sergeant Misael Reyes that Muoio had 'physically forced her' to meet men for sex since 2009 through a company called VIP Escort Services. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, would meet eight to 10 men a day, six days a week, according to a search warrant. The warrant also stated that the woman started living with Muoio and his mother, with the man taking the money she earned and 'restricting where she could go and who she could talk to'. Investigators seized two phones Muoio is accused of using to take photos and post adverts on Craigslist, before communicating with clients. Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said: 'Human trafficking cases, or modern day slavery, involve unspeakable and unthinkable acts of inhumanity.

"A 15-year-old girl who shot dead her brother, 16, suffered years of abuse, including being locked in a room for weeks at a time with only a blanket and a bucket to use the bathroom, according to police. In documents seen by Daily Mail Online, the girl had been sexually abused for years by an uncle. In 2011, the brother and sister were discovered having sex by their mother. The shooting happened on Monday at a small, white house off a dirt road in rural north Florida  while the children's parents were away for work. The father, a truck driver, and his wife, who often goes with him, left the 16-year-old boy to watch over the 15-year-old, her 11-year-old sister and their three-year-old sister, police said. The parents left on Sunday and were due back on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . A 15-year-old girl (left) and her 11-year-old sister (right) are facing murder charges after the eldest girl fatally shot her 16-year-old brother at their Florida home. The 15-year-old had been allegedly caught by the mother having sex with the brother in 2011 and suffered sex abuse at the hands of an uncle . The shooting at a small white house off a dirt road in rural north Florida happened on Monday while the children's parents were away for work . The girls' mother, 33, told police that they often locked the 15-year-old girl up when she misbehaved. She had recently been removed from school. The longest they kept the girl locked in her room was 20 consecutive days, the father told police. In the  room, police found only a blanket and a bucket filled with urine in the closet, allegedly a punishment because the girl was stealing and talking back. Letters from the parents asking her why she should be let out of that room were also found in the police investigation. 'It was learned that (the 15-year-old girl) has made past attempts at ending her life but neither law enforcement nor (emergency management services) was notified,' police wrote in their report. Police documents released on Wednesday said the girl's uncle was convicted of molesting her in 2010. The uncle was arrested in December 2010 on sex charges after his wife found a USB with movie clips of him and the 15-year-old engaged in sexual acts. It had been going on for some time. The 16-year-old victim was allegedly shot dead by his younger sister as he lay sleeping . According to police documents, his wife reported seeing a video clip of the girl sitting down and a man with his penis out, standing behind her. He then had oral sex with the underage girl, while she made noises, the wife told police. The victim later told investigators that she did not want it to happen. The uncle had told her to 'suck on his thingy' and that 'they were to be private and not to tell anyone no matter what'. The abuse had been going on 'for a long time', according to the police report, and the videotaping for about a year. The uncle was convicted and is on the registered sex offender's list. Police documents also revealed that the children's mother discovered the siblings having sex in 2011. The mother reported to police that she heard noises coming from the bedroom and found the teenage boy having sex with his sister, who is a year younger. The mother told police that she separated the siblings. Authorities and child welfare officials investigated, but no one was charged. Sometime on Monday, the 15-year-old girl was locked in her room by her brother, police said. After the boy fell asleep, she talked her 11-year-old sister into unlocking her door. The older girl knew her parents kept a pistol in their room, but they had locked their door. So the girl went outside and used a knife to remove an air conditioner from her parents' bedroom window. She climbed in while her 11-year-old sister kept watch and grabbed the gun out of a pink bag and loaded it, police said. The girl went back inside the house, telling her young siblings to hide in the closet, she told police. She turned her head and fired at her sleeping brother in the living room, and he screamed 'Help! Help!' The victim was shot in the neck from five feet away. She buried her head in a pillow for a while and upon returning to the living room, the girl found the three-year-old, crying and trying to wake the dead brother, according to the police report. She then gathered belongings and some money, fleeing with her 11-year-old sister and leaving the youngest sister behind, police said. 'It's hard for us to get our arms around this act,' Columbia County Sheriff Mark Hunter said. 'This is the stuff nightmares are made of.' Police caught up with the girls after a friend received a 'weird phone call' from the 11-year-old girl, saying she had run away and needed someone to pick her up from a Dollar General, according to a police report. The girls had walked four miles from their home to the store. When the woman arrived, she found the older sister there, too. The older girl said something might have been wrong with another sibling at home. As she spoke, she applied makeup and 'would not maintain eye contact and appeared emotionless,' officers wrote in a police report. The parents, pictured in court on Wednesday, have been charged with child neglect and failing to supervise. The girls' mother told police that they often locked the 15-year-old girl up when she misbehaved . She soon started crying and told the officers that her brother had beaten her and that she had shot him. When officers arrived at the home, the three-year-old said: 'he's dead.' The brother's body was lying near the fireplace, under a blanket with his head on a pillow. The gun was found on a blanket in the hallway. Police have not released a motive for the shooting. The girls are in being held in juvenile detention on suspicion of murder, and a prosecutor is trying to decide whether they will be charged as adults. The mother and 37-year-old father were charged with child neglect and failing to supervise. The parents and daughters appeared before a judge on Wednesday morning. The parents' bail was set at $20,000 each and both were ordered to have no contact with their children. The three-year-old is in the custody of child welfare officials. Because of the girls' ages and abuse allegations, the girls, their brother or the parents have not been named. The family home, situated down a dirt track in north Florida, is marked with evidence tape after a 15-year-old girl stole a gun from her parents' bedroom and shot her brother dead .","The girl allegedly turned her head away and shot her brother in the neck at the Florida home as he screamed 'Help!

"A teenager's attempt to take his friend's attractive mother to the prom has been foiled by his school - after the boy's online campaign to make it happen swept across the internet. Virginia high school student Anthony Pinnisi took to Twitter on Thursday night asking people to 'help a dude out' with a series of racy images of his friend's mother. The senior at Patriot High School in the Virginia suburbs of Washington DC, had asked his friend Chloe Albright if he could take her mother to the prom if he got enough online support. After his friend said 500,000 retweets would be required, and expressed her doubts that he could achieve this total, Pinnisi posted the conversation to Twitter with the images of Chloe's mother. Challenge accepted: A Virginia teen recently started an online campaign to ask his friend's mom (left) out to prom . Tweet: Pinnisi tweeted these images of his conversation with Chloe and photographs of her mother . Looking for a date: Anthony Pinnisi (left) asked his friend Chloe (right) how many Twitter re-tweets he would need to take her mom out to prom and she said 500,000.  He amassed 80,000 in just a 24 hour period, before he was forced by his school to take the tweet down . But after 80,000 people retweeted his post, school officials stepped in and told him to stop his online campaign. His friend also seemed to be unimpressed at his antics - and the thoughts of her mother are unknown. Many Twitter users found Anthony's elaborate prom proposal hilarious, but others called him out for being inappropriate. Chloe, for one, didn't seem to find it too amusing. Criticism: Some called Anthony out for being inappropriate on Twitter, but many also found the campaign humorous . Campaign over: Above, the tweet Anthony wrote after his school asked him to take the tweet down . Prom date? Pictures of Chloe's mom that the young girl posted to her personal Twitter account . Not funny: Chloe didn't seem to impressed by Anthony's online campaign, as evidenced by this tweet . Mother and daughter: Chloe posted this picture of her and her mother on vacation to Twitter, shortly before Anthony's online campaign started .","Virginia high-schooler Anthony Pinnisi jokingly asked his friend Chloe if he could take her mother to prom .

"A father has been forced to sign the sex offenders register after a paper girl saw him standing naked at his living room window. Daniel Beveridge, 56, was arrested after a paper girl reported seeing him naked from outside his home in Fairways, Dunfermline, 'a number of times' . Dunfermline Sheriff Court was told the girl had delivered papers in the area between 2013 and 2014. Daniel Beveridge, 56, was arrested after a paper girl reported seeing him naked at his living room window from outside his home in Fairways, Dunfermline, 'a number of times' Prosecutor Azrah Yousaff said: 'This came to light after a paper girl delivered her papers between 2013 and 2014. 'She went past the accused's house on a few occasions and she seen him standing completely naked at his living room window. 'This happened three or four times. 'She told her gran about the situation. 'On the 15 April 2014, at about 10 to seven in the morning, the paper girl was delivering her papers and when she was delivering them she looked at the accused's house and seen him fully clothed at his living room window. 'She made a few more deliveries and returned to the accused's house minutes later and as she past she seen him completely naked standing in the middle of the living room window. 'She said she felt uncomfortable and disturbed by this.' Mrs Yousaff said the paper girl told her grandmother, who then called the police. Dunfermline Sheriff Court was told that it was 'common practice' for Beveridge to sleep naked and then wander around his house with no clothes on . She added that the next day, on the 16th April, the paper girl witnessed Beveridge standing naked again and mentioned it to a neighbour of the accused. Beveridge, of Fairways, Dunfermline pled guilty to committing an offence of public indecency on a number of occasions between January 1 2013 and April 16 2014 at his home address. His defence lawyer, Jonathan Matheson-Dear told the court that it was 'common practice' for Beveridge to sleep naked and then wander around his house with no clothes on. He said: 'It was thoughtlessness on his part. 'He didn't give it any thought that anybody passing outside couldn't see in. 'It is clear that it was not presented at any particular individual. 'Because it was in his home he thought it was perfectly acceptable behaviour. 'He is extremely embarrassed and ashamed and is aware that he will be place on the register. 'He is a married man with children.' Sheriff Charlie Macnair placed Beveridge on the sex offenders register and deferred sentencing for reports to be produced. He said: 'Sentence is deferred for a criminal justice social work report to be produced.'","Dunfermline Sheriff Court heard Daniel Beveridge was seen inside house .

"In the search for ultimate beauty, many women - and some men - choose to lengthen their eyelashes. But a study has claimed that doing so can have detrimental effects and prevent them doing what they were supposed to do. The scientists say that eyelashes should not be longer than a third the width of your eye, otherwise they are less effective at keeping eyes moist and clean. Scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology studied eyelash length (stock image shown). They say they should not be longer than a third of your eye width. In the study they looked at 22 different species of mammal. They found that eyelashes played an important role in keeping eyes moist and dust-free . The research, to be published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface, was carried out by scientists from the Georgia Institute of Technology. They reported that, while some of the benefits of eyelashes were already known, there were lesser known effects that would be hindered by making them longer. ‘We essentially found that there filtering aspect of eyelashes could help reduce the amount of airborne particulate [dust] deposited onto the eye,’ PhD student and author of the study Guillermo Amador told MailOnline. In their study they looked at 22 diverse species of mammals, ‘from hedgehogs to giraffes,’ and found that optimal eyelash length was typically one third an eye's width. Eye experts have discovered a drug used to treat glaucoma can also boost the growth and prominence of eyelashes. In a year-long trial, researchers at Southampton General Hospital and St Louis University in the US analysed the effects of a daily application of bimatoprost to the upper eyelid of patients with poor eyelash growth, known as idiopathic hypotrichosis, or eyelash loss as a result of recent chemotherapy. Conventionally, under the brand name Lumigan, the drug has been used in eye drop form to decrease the amount of fluid in the eye and reduce eye pressure, treating both glaucoma and ocular hypertension. A total of 368 patients - four men and 364 women - of an average age of 50-years-old took part in the study, which found length in those with idiopathic hypotrichosis increased from 5.69mm to 7.12mm after six months and thickness from 0.79mm² to 1.30mm². Any more, and they were less effective. Mr Amador added there was no optimal minimal length, but positive effects started to be noticed ‘above a length of zero.’ Using synthetic meshes to simulate eyelashes, they then tested their aerodynamic capabilities in wind tunnel experiments. When the eyelashes were the appropriate length, one third the eye width, they reduced evaporation and dust accumulation by 50 per cent. The ability was due to the reduced air flow over the eye from the eyelashes. Lengthening the eyelashes, however, stopped this ability from working. When they were too long, they no longer trapped air, and instead funneled air onto the eye - increasing evaporation and dust accumulation. In other words, they made them drier and dustier. ‘Beyond a certain length, which was about a third of the eye, the evaporation rate would increase,’ said Mr Amador. ‘To get any sort of length they need to be bigger than no lashes, but beyond the optimal length they attract more air flow.’ Celebrities like Katy Perry are known for their long eyelashes, but are they making their eyes dry and dusty in the process? ‘We essentially found that there filtering aspect of eyelashes could help reduce the amount of [dust],’ PhD student and author of the study Guillermo Amador told MailOnline . In their study they looked at 22 diverse species of mammals, ‘from hedgehogs to giraffes,’ and found that optimal eyelash length was typically one third an eye's width, as shown in this diagram. The researchers came to the conclusion by testing synthetic eyelashes in wind tunnel experiments . While there is an aesthetic aspect to the research, there is also a less obvious conclusion to come out of it: space exploration. The researchers say that their studies could help develop cleaning devices for optical sensors and even rovers on other planets. Specifically, Mr Amador says the research could help clean solar panels on rovers on Mars. Nasa’s Spirit and Opportunity rovers, only the latter of which is still active, were both powered by solar panels. However, when the Martian winter came along, it brought with it intense dust storms for a few months. In order to survive these for a few months, the rovers needed to angle themselves towards the sun, to ensure they got as much sunlight as possible and stayed alive if their panels were covered in dust. If the rover survived, the panels were often cleaned at a later date by the Martian wind. This is ultimately what led to the demise of the Spirit rover in 2010; when it became stuck in soft soil, it was unable to orientate itself towards the sun and survive the Martian winter. The researchers found that the longer the eyelashes, the more air was directed towards the eye (shown in image). This brought more dust with it, and prevented the eye from staying moist. ‘Beyond a certain length, which was about a third of the eye, the evaporation rate would increase,’ said Mr Amador . Pictured is the Spirit rover, which in early 2010 succumbed to the Martian weather and ultimately ceased contact with Earth after it became stuck in soil and its solar panels were covered in dust. This new research, however, could apparently help develop cleaning devices for panels on future rovers . Mr Amador and his team, therefore, suggest that their technique could be used to create small meshes on the rover that protect future solar panels from dust. ‘Trying to prevent the accumulation of dust on the surface [of the solar panels] would help it function autonomously without it powering down and waiting for Martian winds to remove particles,' he said. The current Curiosity rover, however, has a plutonium power source, as solar panels were deemed insufficient to power the large car-sized machine on Mars. But maybe on future smaller rovers, Nasa will consider employing these synthetic eyelashes to keep them operational. For now, the research is more applicable here on Earth. Beauty experts take note: don’t make your eyelashes longer than a third of your eye width, or it could spell trouble for your sight.","Scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology studied eyelash length .

"An Uttar Pradesh cleric has offered a reward of Rs 51 crore to 'any 'individual or organisation' behind the attack on French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo, in which 12 people were brutally slain by masked gunmen. Addressing journalists in Meerut on Wednesday evening, Haji Yaqub Qureshi, who is also a former state government minister, said: “Any work against religion and the Prophet must not be tolerated at any cost. The French magazine was continuously committing a crime by targeting religion. This was the reason that its office was attacked and journalists were killed. We will give a reward of Rs 51 crore to any individual or organisation which comes forward and claims that they executed this attack.” He added: “Whatever happened in Paris was absolutely justified.” Outrageous: UP cleric Haji Yuqub Qureshi, pictured here in a file photo, has offered a reward of Rs 51 crore to those responsible for killing 12 people in an attack on the Paris magazine Charlie Hebdo . Later, Qureshi claimed his statement had been twisted - but didn't deny that he had supported the terrorist attack. Reactions . Reacting to his outburst, Naib Sheher Qazi of Meerut Jenur Rashideen said: “There is no place for terrorists in Islam. Those who are making wild statements to laud the attack on the French weekly must be condemned.” The Bharatiya Janata Party’s Uttar Pradesh spokesman Vijay Bahadur Pathak said: “The government must register a case against Qureshi and arrest him. He has been trying to terrorise society. His only place is in jail.” Known for declaring himself the most popular Muslim politician of India, the 54-year-old Qureshi has been dubbed a megalomaniac by many. The controversial cleric was once a poster boy of Mulayam Singh Yadav’s Samajwadi Party (SP), Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), and former prime minister late Vishwanath Pratap Singh’s Jan Morcha. Denounced: The BJP's Uttar Pradesh spokesman Vijay Bahadur Pathak (left) called on the government to register a case against Qureshi (right) after the cleric offered a reward of Rs 51 crore to the Charlie Hebdo terrorists . Qureshi, who is always clad in terry-cotton fabric and sports white sneakers with a loose beard, hit the headlines on February 17, 2006 when he announced at a Friday prayer in Meerut that he would give Rs 51 crore to anyone for beheading a Danish cartoonist whose caricature of Prophet Mohammad had appeared in a newspaper in Denmark. At that time, Qureshi was Minister of State for Minority Welfare and Haj in the Mulayam government. The politician again hogged the limelight when he was caught travelling without a train ticket on September 16, 2007 and attacked the railway authorities when they sought his ticket or pass. He was let off after paying a fine of Rs 14,056. During those days, he was often heard saying at public meetings: “As of date, I am the most known international Muslim leader.” He won the Meerut Assembly seat in 2007 on a United Democratic Front (UDF) ticket and then merged it with the BSP. Mourning: French nationals held a vigil on January 8 outside the French Embassy in New Delhi for those killed in the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine . Although he was known for having little control over his speeches, BSP chief Mayawati somehow managed to contain him for a while. However,  in 2011 he caused controversy again by making a derogatory remark against the Sikh community. This infuriated the Dalit leader, who declared that she had suspended him from the party. The suspension proved short-lived, as Mayawati  fielded Qureshi in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Moradabad with the hope that Muslim votes would take him to victory. In fact, he lost that election. Meanwhile, Omkar Singh, senior superintendent of police, Meerut, has said that they have started a probe into Qureshi’s statement.

"The pros are getting into pot. Founders Fund, the $2 billion San Francisco venture capital firm run by Silicon Valley stars including Peter Thiel, co-founder and former CEO of PayPal, is investing in Privateer Holdings, a marijuana company that owns several pot-related brands. The companies declined to disclose the size of the investment Thursday, but described it as a 'multi-million dollar' participation in a $75 million fundraising effort by Privateer. The deal had been rumored last year. Founders Fund, the $2 billion San Francisco venture capital firm run by Silicon Valley stars including Peter Thiel, pictured, is investing in Privateer Holdings . Founders: (From left to right) Christian Groh, Brendan Kennedy and Michael Blue of Privateer Holdings are seen together in this March 2014 file photo . Privateer, based in Seattle, owns the Canadian medical marijuana producer Tilray and the pot information service Leafly. It is also launching a brand of marijuana and products with the family of Bob Marley called Marley Natural. Founders Fund partner Geoff Lewis, who is leading the firm's investment in Privateer, said in an interview that he believes the broader legalization of marijuana is inevitable. 'Public sentiment is there, and it crosses political lines,' Lewis said. There are 23 states that allow the use of marijuana for medical purposes and Colorado has legalized its recreational use. There has been some pushback, however, despite growing public support. The states of Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the legalization of marijuana in Colorado, saying that they are being overrun with marijuana from across their borders. And Founders Fund does not expect a quick turnaround on its investment in Privateer, Lewis said. Founders is investing in Privateer because it believes Privateer can eventually establish mainstream brands that will be recognized and trusted as marijuana becomes legal and socially acceptable, he said. Privateer was founded in 2010 and has previously landed $22 million in funding. Before the announcement Thursday, Privateer's funding came mostly through wealthy individuals and investment offices that steer private family funds. Privateer CEO Brendan Kennedy thinks the Founders investment will lead to more professional investment into marijuana-related businesses and help advance the push toward legalization. 'One of the important milestones for this business is having access to capital, and significant capital,' he said. 'There will be a lot of people who wake up (now) and realize they need to look at this industry just as they have looked at other emerging industries around the world.'

"Several hundred fans braved freezing cold on Thursday to join Elvis Presley's family in Memphis, Tennessee on what would have been the King of Rock 'n' Roll's 80th birthday. Cheers went up as Presley's former wife Priscilla and their only child Lisa Marie, along with Elvis' grandchildren, sliced an eight-tier cake frozen by the 16F temperature, then sang happy birthday to the king. Fans got a chance to get a bite of the cake at a diner across the street from Graceland, the Presley residence that has become a shrine to his life, work and rich musical legacy. In a ceremony held at Graceland this morning, January 8 was declared to be Elvis Presley Day in Memphis, Tennessee. Scroll down for video .

Ben, the lone male grandchild of Elvis, isn't seen in public as much as his older sister Riley, a model. Their father is Lisa-Marie's first husband, whom she married when just 20. Priscilla married Elvis then had Lisa Marie in 1968 when she was 22 years old. Lisa Marie also had children in her earlier 20s - giving birth to Riley when she was 21 and Ben when she was 24 . Priscilla (left), holds the hand of one of her twin granddaughters and is followed by her daughter, Lisa Marie (right). The Presley family returned to Memphis to celebrate Elvis' 80th with hundreds of fans . 'My gosh, I'm in total shock. So many of you here!' said Priscilla Presley, 69, adding that Elvis 'would have been amazed' to see so many fans come out for his birthday. 'There's really no where else we'd rather be,' added Lisa Marie, 46, accompanied by her four children - Riley and Benjamin Keough and six-year-old twins Harper and Finley Lockwood. Elvis Presley's grandchildren Ben Keough (L) and Riley Keough stand in front of Graceland during a proclamation of Elvis Presley Day . Riley Keough holds her little sister Finley Lockwood in front of Graceland during a proclamation of Elvis Presley Day . The twin girls were born in 2008 to Lisa Marie's fourth husband, guitarist and music producer, Michael Lockwood. Elvis Presley was born in poverty in Tupelo, Mississippi on January 8, 1935, and as a teen moved to Memphis with his parents and absorbed the mixture of blues, rhythm and blues, and African-American gospel from which rock music emerged. Flowers and birthday wishes from around the world lie beside the grave of Elvis Presley at his home at Graceland . A wreath commemorating what would have been Elvis Presley's 80th Birthday sits by the grave of the late singer at his home . He moved to Memphis with his parents at age 13. He died on August 16, 1977 in Memphis at the age of 42. An American pop culture icon like few others, Presley rode high in the rock music charts in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s before his untimely death. His legacy includes 108 songs on Billboard magazine's Hot 100 pop music chart as well as 129 records in the Billboard 200 album chart - most recently in 2002 with a greatest hits set. 'He has stayed on top all these years,' said Scotty Moore, 83, of Nashville, the guitarist and last man standing from the recording session that yielded the 1954 hit That's All Right. Flowers and birthday wishes from around the world lie beside the grave of Elvis Presley . That first session at Sun Studios in Memphis changed everything in popular music and culture, said Peter Cooper, writer and editor for Nashville's Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. 'It changed all of our lives, even those of us who weren't born yet. It changed the way we dress and the way we wear our hair and the way we talk,' said Cooper. 'It was a reset button for the United States of America.' Elvis' 69-year-old ex-wife, told fans she was in shock that so many of them had turned out in freezing temperatures to celebrate the music legend's birthday . No denying those genes: Lisa Marie's fraternal twin girls, Harper and Finley, aged seven, both have the family's Presley pout . Other birthday events on Thursday include an auction of authenticated Elvis memorabilia including his first driver's license and the jacket he wore in the movie 'Viva Las Vegas.' Also up for grabs is the first recording Presley ever made - an acetate disc from Sun Studios on which he sang the 1940s chestnut 'My Happiness' for his mother. He was 18 at the time. Fans with deeper pockets can meanwhile bid in a separate auction on Presley's two private jets, which have been on display since the 1980s across the street from Graceland. Their owners say they are under an April deadline to remove the Lockheed JetStar and Convair 880 after Presley's estate said it would not renew a joint venture agreement to exhibit them. But on social media, both Priscilla and Lisa Marie have signaled they are unhappy with the sale, which is being handled by a Los Angeles auction house. 'It is the owners who are doing all of this to try and get more money,' wrote singer-songwriter Lisa Marie on her Twitter feed, to which she added the hashtag: '#Greed.'

"The BBC has submitted its live coverage of the police raid on Sir Cliff Richard’s home for a top television journalism award . The BBC has submitted its controversial live coverage of the police raid on Sir Cliff Richard’s home for a top television journalism award. Despite the continuing fallout from the story, the Corporation has entered its footage for Scoop of the Year at the Royal Television Society’s prestigious Television Journalism Awards next month. A source was quoted as saying: ‘It was a good story and it was important to stand by our journalism. Notwithstanding the controversy, when we came to assess the best scoops of the year this was definitely up there.’ The BBC has faced the threat of legal action from the singer since it screened live footage, shot from a helicopter, of the raid at his £3.5million Berkshire residence last August – and stationed reporters at the house’s gates even before police arrived. Sir Cliff, 74, vigorously denies an allegation of sexual abuse of a boy under 16 at a Christian rally in 1985. No charges have been brought. His lawyer Gideon Benaim said the BBC report led to ‘immeasurable harm to our client and was both premature and disproportionate’. Tony Hall, the BBC’s Director- General, faced a grilling by MPs after it emerged that its journalists had been tipped off about the raid by South Yorkshire Police. A report into the affair by the Home Affairs Select Committee, published in October, said South Yorkshire Police had been ‘utterly inept’ but added that the Corporation was ‘well within its rights’ to run the story. As a result of being tipped off, TV reporters were able to film live aerial shots of the raid on Sir Cliff’s home on August 14. A camera in a helicopter zoomed in on officers through windows as they searched the star’s belongings, while journalists reported live from his gates. After the broadcast, the BBC received hundreds of complaints from viewers, with many saying that the coverage made the singer look guilty. Tip off: Reporters waited at Sir Cliff's gates for police to arrive for the raid in August last year . At the time of the select committee’s report in October, Lord Hall said that if a news editor or other senior figure had been informed of the sensitivity of the investigation, ‘we would not have run the story’. The report claimed that a BBC reporter, Dan Johnson, threatened to break the story prematurely unless he was granted ‘inside access’ to the police raid. Keith Vaz MP, the committee’s chairman, commented: ‘South Yorkshire Police’s handling of this situation was utterly inept. ‘No British citizen should have to watch their home being raided by the police live on television. Sir Cliff Richard has suffered enormous and irreparable damage to his reputation and he is owed an apology.’ The singer was interviewed under caution by police ten days after the raid. He has described the allegation as ‘completely false’ and has been supported by a host of celebrities including Cilla Black, who said last summer that she was ‘absolutely positive’ that he was innocent. The Royal Television Awards will take place on February 18. Last night a BBC spokesman refused to comment.","BBC screened live footage of the raid on Sir Cliff Richard's home in August .

Tatiana's siblings suffered only minor injuries, and were treated for scratches and bruises. Police had followed the car into Bessbrook Way, a cul-de-sac, when the driver ran down a garden fence and drove into a backyard near where the children were playing about 7pm last night. The Audi was being chased by five police cars, but police have yet to forensically confirm which vehicle struck the child. Neighbour Raymond Nair is adamant the impact occurred on the street, not in the backyard. Mr Nair, who lives two doors up from the family home, watched on in shock and told of how he saw members of the family run out of the home, crying out loud. ‘The kids ran inside and called the mum and they ran outside and saw her there,' he told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I came out and saw the Audi and then the undercover cop car with the siren on and four other police cars behind them.’ An emotional police officer on the scene at Bessbrook Way in Constitution Hill near Parramatta . A child's toy is teen lying on the grass near a fence which was mowed down by an allegedly stolen Audi . Mr Nair said the Audi went through the small and usually quiet culdesac at Bessbrook Way at high speed of about 100km/h. ‘The Audi went straight through the fence and then the backyard and the fence into the park and the kids were playing out the front, on their bicycles you know,' he said. ‘Then I heard the bang and I went and saw the little kid on the floor and bleeding and everything and then I went and asked if I could help but the police said ""no, it’s a crime scene"" so they I did what they told me and backed off.’ ‘Then I was standing there for a while and I was in shock with the little girl just there. ‘I couldn’t believe what I saw in this street. Why a chase like this in this street?’ Kristina, 13, was among a group of a dozen local children playing cricket with other members of the Tauaifaga family in the park, which borders the housing commission estate, just moments earlier. She was one of several locals who visited the scene of the accident on Friday afternoon - as a small makeshift shrine of flowers and cards began to take shape. 'We had just finished playing and stopped to sit on the wall for a few minutes,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'Then all of a sudden there's all crashing and banging and we look up the hill and there's cars smashing through the fence right into the park and they're chasing the Audi down the hill. 'Then we see another car come into the park from behind us. 'One of her brothers started running up to the house and that's when we heard what happened.' Police had followed the car into Bessbrook Way, a cul-de-sac, when the driver ran down a garden fence . Police have established a critical incident investigation to look at all circumstances surrounding the incident, including the pursuit. The investigation will be overseen by the Professional Standards Command. A 22-year-old woman, reportedly a passenger in the Audi, was arrested in Darlinghurst in inner-city Sydney and will appear in court on Friday. Police arrested the woman on Clapton Place and will allege she was searched and found in possession of prohibited drugs. She was taken to Kings Cross Police Station and charged with supplying a prohibited drug and two counts of possessing a prohibited drug. Police also executed six outstanding warrants for offences including; armed with intent to commit an indictable offence, affray, stealing, possessing housebreaking implements, possessing a prescribed restricted substance, using a false document to influence exercise of public duty, and two counts of goods in custody. The wanted man, described as being in his mid to late 20s, remains on the run this afternoon but is apparently well known to police, who want to question him in relation a spate of armed robberies in the local area in the past month. On Thursday evening, the Audi smashed through the Bessbrook Way fence before driving through another fence on the property and into nearby Richill Park. Another group of children playing cricket were forced to drop their bats and run to get out of the vehicle's dangerous path. The toddler sustained fatal injuries in the chase involving an allegedly stolen car and multiple police vehicles . Reports have emerged that up to seven other children of Samoan background - including the 17-month-old's twin - were playing in the backyard when the car drove through . Witness Carol Davis said she screamed at the children to run for their lives as the car came tearing through the park. 'I ran up to the house and I see the mother holding her newborn baby, she was screaming,' Ms Davis told the Daily Telegraph. 'I could hear the kids in the house just going ballistic, they were petrified.' Rose, 14, is a friend of the Tauaifaga children and was visibly upset when she recounted the incidents of Thursday night. ‘I was outside when it happened, I heard this bang and then everything went slow and then fast again and everything broke, the whole fence and then I saw one Audi car and two four-wheel-drives chasing it,’ she said. ‘Then the first car hit a trolley and the others kept following it. I got scared and then ran inside. ‘Then I looked from inside and saw the mum holding the baby, calling out “someone call an ambulance”. ‘I sat outside for a bit. I’m feeling very upset, we used to play together.’ A neighbour said the Audi came through the normally quiet and small Bessbrook Way at high speed . The driver of the car is still at large and is believed to be known to police. Assistant Commissioner Frank Mennilli said the offenders involved in the police pursuit were violent and 'a risk to the community'. He urged any associates to come forward with information. 'This person is well known to them, they know who this person is it is best for them to come forward,' Mr Mennilli said. Mr Mennilli said the officers involved in the incident are suffering. 'My thoughts and prayers go to the family but to also the police involved. 'They are distraught - they really are - these are family members, they've got children the same age. They are doing it very tough at the moment.' Police have established a critical incident investigation to look at all circumstances surrounding the incident .","Tatiana 'Talia' Tauaifaga, 17 months, was killed during a police pursuit .

"Every weekend around the UK, in spacious private houses and mansions, champagne flows, music throbs and guests are bathed in soft gentle light. These aren't A-list events but the latest generation of 'posh orgies', according to a new Channel 4 documentary, Sex Party Secrets airing tonight. Welcome to the world of the sexual elite where the proclivities detailed in erotic novels like Fifty Shades Of Grey aren't just the stuff of fiction. Scroll down for video . A new generation of orgies is springing up in which young, professional couples join invite-only sex events . Forget tales of wife-swapping in Suburbia, these bashes are for young, attractive and professional couples seeking extra thrills in a sophisticated setting. They take place in expensive townhouses, sprawling West Country mansions or even on yachts or villas in Ibiza. Forget Christian Grey's red room of pain, at Pure Pleasure Parties in Spain's clubbing capital, there's a 'human jigsaw room', consisting of a 'giant bed where it's all happening', says organiser Louise. Guests must pass a strict vetting procedure and are largely, young, professional with impeccable grooming habits - if there is a dress code it would involve having Brazilian bikini waxes. Chris Reynolds Gordon  runs  Heaven Circle, which organises exclusive orgies where the guest list is as strict as any private members club. While thousands of people apply to join there are only 90 members. He says: 'It's becoming way more open, I don't want to use the word trendy, but it's quite the thing to do at the moment.' Sexual safety is paramount at these events and condoms - in various sizes - are laid on for guests . 'You say to your friends, by the way me and my girlfriend went off and did that. They will probably say ""oh that's weird we do the same thing""' Asked why he started creating his own events he says, 'I've been to other parties and I thought I can do better than this.' He admits he didn't want middle aged people people at his parties. 'We've had actors, actresses, models to nurses lawyers, teachers, old school mates even.' One event featured in the programme is held in a £30million London townhouse complete with a hot tub and stuccoed 18th-century stone staircase. Anonymous party-goers talking to the camera wear Venetian masks but even they can't disguise the women's cut glass accents and model cheekbones. The men show off muscled torsos, shaved chests and hipster haircuts. Another organiser Jon Blue looks like a fashion designer with his bleached hair, dapper headgear and waspish sense of humour. Instead he runs  invite-only orgies, set in  beautiful country piles where clinches take place in four-poster beds and on vast manicured lawns. He says: 'Here we have VIP room where we have the lovely food and champagne for people who have paid a little extra.' 'This is someone's home which is obviously different to hiring a venue like a club because you have to have a little more respect.' Increasing numbers of couples are spicing up their sex lives at controlled events filled with people like them . 'They're lovely owners, very chilled and enjoying the whole spectacle.' 'The idea is that we will have lots of flamboyant spectacle creatures, the theme is mythology, so we're going to have a mermaid in the pool and a unicorn.' 'Basically we open up the house and the play rooms are open and hopefully by that stage we've got their juices flowing and their passion built up and there's a collective arousal.' Mr Blue's goal is to create an entirely new, exotic environment in which to spice up their sex lives either with each other or a variety of partners. 'Most people don't have to have sex on a bed, you could have it on a couch, the corner of a couch, there's plenty of bed space. But the idea of my parties is it’s more a beautiful party, where there's sex possible.' Meanwhile Pure Pleasure Parties take the old fashioned orgy into the rarified environment of private villas and yachts in Ibiza. The events are so popular they're attended by up to 250 people. Louise, the tanned, up-front woman behind the adults-only business says, 'We have parties in yachts as well as villa parties and mansion parties. For the ones in Ibiza you have a 15-strong dance show. 'The things that are different about my parties are that they really are for the elite. The phones are taken off people on the door. There is no chance of being filmed at these parties whatever your position you are safe and secure.' She says: 'We are not born to be with one partner for all our life. Come to a party, live out your fantasies together or let your guy go off and do what a man needs to do.' Dressing up in strappy heels, sexy underwear with trimmed and waxed bikini lines is de rigeur at these events . Sandy and Poppy, first timers at a Heaven Circle, described the thrill of being accepted to the select group as being 'awesome'. On arrival at the event's chic six-bedroom town house, the pair sipped Champagne and watched 'an orgy with five couples all on the same bed all having sex in several different positions.' Another married couple Charlotte and Frank are  sex party regulars. She says: 'My husband likes to see me having fun with other men.' Frank adds: 'I just get extremely turned on because I know what the other chap is feeling. When we come back afterwards we are just buzzing and bouncing off the walls from the evening that's just happened.' 'On the way back from a party we usually have to stop on route and get in the back of the car and have some fun. We have sex again on the way home.' Books like Fifty Shades Of Grey have helped bring alternative sexual practices into the mainstream .","Private event with 60 couples took place in £30million London townhouse .

"Target has defended its decision to only stock larger sizes of its new Lily Pulitzer collection online, not in stores, a week after an angry consumer backlash erupted. 'The last time we did this, it didn't work,' said Target spokesperson Joshua Thomas told Refinery 29, referring to poor sales of the plus sizes it tested with its Calypso St. Barth collaboration in 2011, which was also offered exclusively online. Last week, one Twitter user, grownandcurvywoman, echoed the sentiments of many plus-size consumers when she tweeted: 'It's like Target is dating a fat girl but won't take her out in public.. that's how I feel right now.' Scroll down for video . Eagerly anticipated:  Target's upcoming collaboration with popular American fashion label Lilly Pulitzer goes on sale on April 19, with sizes larger than US 18 available, but only online . Responding to the criticism, Mr Thomas said Target was offering its Lily Pulitzer collection in sizes larger than US 18 exclusively online to 'try different things' and 'be flexible.' He added: 'We need to take a measured approach in terms of responding to the guests. 'They say this is something they want to purchase; so we're hearing the feedback, we're seeing the feedback, and what I think is really important, we are responding to the feedback.' Target had previously described its decision to include larger sizes in the collection as 'democratic'. Outrage: After being applauded for its decision to include plus sizes in the collaboration, Target later revealed the larger options would only be available online . Grown and curvy: Many plus-size fashion fans have hit back at the store's decision, accusing it of discrimination against certain groups of customers . 'They're really saying we only want 40 [per cent] of customers to be seen in store,' Sarah Conley added. The disappointing revelation only came to light after a customer queried a Target spokesperson on its plans for plus size stock of the collection via its Twitter account. 'The question is, is [plus] size going to be sold in every store carrying the line or select store[s] of the standard online online,' FatGirl_fashion tweeted, to which a Target representative replied: '... The plus sized collection will be available online only.' Just hours earlier, Target's senior vice president of apparel and accessories Stacia Andersen released a statement about the store's plans to include a selection of larger sizes in the limited edition collaboration, something which has happened only rarely in the past. 'It’s really important for us that we can provide stylish apparel for everybody, and we felt like this collection was the right time to do it,' she told Fashionista.com. 'They only want 40 per cent of customers in store': The plus-size community has been left feeling angry and frustrated at the news . Ongoing issue: It is not the first time that Target has been accused of disrespecting plus-size men and women . Disappointment: Some women have stated that they are sad to be missing out on the chance to actually browse the clothing in-store . 'This project is so democratic. When we do these collaborations, there’s a certain group of people that always really respond to them. 'But this, anybody can wear this. There’s just such a range that anyone can find something that they love.' The statement was initially praised by the plus-size community - many of whom applauded what they believed to be Target's attempt to change the way it views its larger customers. 'This is a victory for plus-size women...' Plus Model Magazine's Marcy Cruz wrote online. 'It seems Target is willing to try this and see if plus sizes will sell. And we think Lilly Pulitzer is perfect. 'It’s a well-known loved brand that’s chic, stylish and fun and known as the mother of American resort wear.' Bright and bubbly: The bold collection is full of unique prints and patterns . The best is yet to come: The collaboration will launch in-stores and online in April . However, following the recent clarification about Target's plans to only stock the larger sizes online, many are now accusing the retailer of being hypocritical. 'I'm excited about the offering but I'm really sad that we won't be getting the shopping experience,' Jeniese Hosey said on Twitter, before adding: 'I feel like we got served steak on a garbage can lid... like my Grandma used to say...' This is not the first time that Target has faced criticism from its plus size customers; in August, fashion blogger Chastity Valentine called for a nationwide boycott of the store, after it was revealed that the retailer would not offer any plus sizes as part of its recent Altuzarra collaboration. 'All I want is the clothing you offer all your other regular sized customers, but you always leave me out,' she wrote on her blog Garner Style. 'With that being said, I have to end this relationship. It’s you, not me and for my own well-being and my self dignity I have to sever ties between us.'","Last week, Target announced via its Twitter account that  sizes larger than US 18 for its new Lilly Pulitzer collection will only be available online .

"'Revenge porn': New York Jets linebacker Jermaine Cunningham, who has been charged with sharing explicit photos of a female friend . New York Jets linebacker Jermaine Cunningham is embroiled in the latest high-profile case of so-called 'revenge porn' after he was charged with sharing explicit photos of a woman. The Union County prosecutor's office said Cunningham was arrested December 29 in Summit, New Jersey, and charged with invasion of privacy, criminal mischief and unlawful weapons transport. They allege Cunningham violated a law that forbids disclosing photos or videos without the consent of someone 'whose intimate parts are exposed' or who is engaged in a sex act. They told the Associated Press Cunningham had lived with the woman involved. It wasn't immediately known how or where the images were shared. Cunningham was arrested at his apartment after police responded to a 911 call from someone nearby at about 4.15pm, Union County Prosecutor's office spokesman Mark Spivey told NJ.com. Mr Spivey said the criminal mischief charge was in connection with alleged destruction of clothes belonging to the former resident, who had been in a relationship with Cunningham. Cunningham was released without bail. It wasn't immediately known if he had an attorney. A Summit phone number wasn't listed for Cunningham. The criminal mischief and invasion of privacy charges are third-degree offenses that can be punished by prison sentences of up to five years upon conviction. The unlawful weapons transport charge came after a loaded .38-calibre handgun was found in Cunningham's Audi, a prosecutor's spokesman said. Police seized the weapon. New Jersey led the U.S. in tackling so-called 'revenge porn', with its 10-year-old law the first in the nation to criminalise spreading sexual images of someone without their consent. Pro football: Jermaine Cunningham #96 and Jarrad Page #44 of the New England Patriots celebrate a defensive stop  against the New York Jets at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Massachusetts, in this 2010 photo . Tom Haydon of NJ.com writes cites lawyers familiar with such invasions of privacy who say the increasing prevalence of camera phones and popularity of social media has nevertheless made it a growing problem. Brooklyn lawyer Carrie Goldberg told him that although the practise is commonly dubbed 'revenge porn', in effect that's actually a catch-all phrase referring to disclosure of sexual pictures without consent. 'Regardless of the motive, the harm and humiliation to the victim are the same,' Ms Goldberg said. Cunningham, a fifth-year professional, missed last season with a torn Achilles tendon. Sports Illustrated reports that he was originally picked by the New England Patriots in the second round of the 2010 NFL draft.  He appeared in 36 games for the Patriots, recording 3.5 sacks, before being cut during training camp in 2013. The New York Jets said it was aware of the charges but declined to comment on the arrest. Cunningham is expected to appear in court within the next few weeks.","Cunningham arrested after police called to his apartment on December 29 .

"Struggling heat-stricken koalas with burnt paws are in desperate need for mittens followed by the devastating bushfires in South Australia and Victoria. The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) has launched a public appeal in a bid to get cotton-made mittens from knitters to help treat injured koalas. The injured marsupials typically come into care with severe burns, especially on their paws, caused by contact with burning trees or from fleeing across fire grounds. It comes as South Australia endured the state's worst fire conditions since the Ash Wednesday and Black Saturday, destroying more than 30 homes and leaving 134 people injured. Scroll down for video and a pattern to make a pair of koala mittens . Calling all knitters! An animal care group has launched a public appeal for mittens to be made to help koalas . When koalas come into care, they get treatment with burns cream and their paws would be covered with bandages before being protected with the special cotton mittens. 'We don't know how many mittens we need but once the grounds are reopened to the wildlife rescuers, they will begin their black walk,' an IFAW spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia. 'We just don't know the extended injuries but we want to have the mittens ready to go and fit over their paws when they come into care to help protect their wounds. 'The treatment for koala burns is quite similar to treating human burns and koalas are very passive animals so they don't react like cats or dogs.' Once the koalas come into care, they will get treatment with burns cream and paws will be covered with bandages before being protected with the special cotton mittens . One of the marsupials being treated and cared for at the wildlife hospital followed by the raging bushfires . When the koalas come into care, they get treatment with burns cream and paws will be covered with bandages . IFAW native wildlife campaigner Josey Sharrad said a plentiful supply of these mittens is needed throughout the bushfire season. 'Just like any burns victim - koalas' dressings need changing daily, meaning a constant supply of mittens is needed by wildlife carers. Some burned koalas can take up to a year to fully recover,' she said. Firefighters and residents  have also provided water to thirsty and severely burnt marsupials since the extreme blaze took place last week. Click here for a special pattern to make your mittens from clean 100% cotton for our furry friends! A young koala is in recovery after suffering second-degree partial thickness burns on all his four paws from the raging bushfires in South Australia . Heartbreaking images of Jeremy the koala have gone viral since he was treated at Australian Marine, Wildlife Research and Rescue Organisation (AMWRRO) on Tuesday . On Tuesday, Jeremy the koala suffered second-degree partial thickness burns on all four of his paws from the raging blaze as he tried to escape the fires.

"When Dr Michael Mosley launched the Fast Diet two years ago, he was confident that it was a great way to lose weight and improve health. But even he could not have been prepared for how the diet would take off, with hundreds of thousands of people around the globe successfully losing weight and transforming their vitality and wellbeing. While the basics haven’t changed — the aim is still to cut calories by three-quarters on two days of the week and eat normally the rest of the time — this week he and his co-author, Mimi Spencer, launch an exciting new Fast Diet book. Scroll down for video . The Fast Diet is simple: cut you calorie intake by three-quarters on two days of the week and eat normally the rest of the time . It includes new recipes for mouth-watering diet day meals that both men and women will love — making it easy to get in shape alongside your partner, as long as you remember that women should eat no more than 500 calories on a diet day, while for men it’s 600 calories. In the book, Dr Mosley also explores the part exercise has to play in health, longevity and weight loss. Don’t worry, he’s not suggesting you embark on a gruelling regime. You won’t have to join an expensive gym, either. The truth is that even if you don’t exercise, you’ll see many benefits from fasting two days a week. However, research shows that 12 minutes of exercise a week can significantly boost results. Yes, that’s right — just 12 minutes a week. And here, in the final part of our Fast Diet series, we’ll show you how to do it. In one study highlighted in the new book, participants were asked to combine 5:2 fasting with three short bursts of high-intensity training (HIT) on three separate days each week. The result was an average weight loss of 4.6kg (10lb) over 12 weeks, all of it fat. One dieter on the programme lost an impressive 12.6kg (2st). Another study found that those who combined intermittent fasting with exercise (40 minutes three times a week) lost twice as much over 12 weeks as those who only did the fasting. The good news is that you don’t need to exercise for anything like 40 minutes to see benefits. Exercising fast-style couldn’t be simpler. Forget running or cycling further, research shows that you gain the most benefit by increasing the intensity of your exercise, not the length of time that you do it. If you push yourself to the max for even a few seconds, there’s no need — according to Dr Mosley — to exercise for very long at all. So whether you choose jogging, cycling, swimming or just trotting up and down a flight of stairs, think short, sharp bursts. Push the intensity as much as you can for 20 (building to 30) seconds, then slow the pace right down for a minute or so, and repeat. If you do it right, there’s no need to be active for more than four minutes in total. Find time for three of these mini-sessions each week, and you will be increasing the effectiveness of the diet and boosting your health. It doesn’t matter whether you exercise on fast days or ordinary days, although studies show you will burn more fat if you exercise on a fast day. You may choose to build fast exercise into your ordinary fitness regime (Dr Mosley builds sprints into his daily cycle home from work). If that doesn’t appeal, rest assured that you can get all the benefit you need in just a total of 12 minutes a week. Start off with a couple of minutes of gentle pedalling, jogging or swimming. When you feel ready, speed up fast and work your body as hard as you can, maintain that intensity for 20 seconds, then slow down and allow your body to recover for a minute by returning to an easy pace. Then repeat the intense ‘sprint’ for 20 seconds before slowing right down again until your heart rate has returned to normal. If you are very unfit or have never tried this sort of training before, slowly build up the sprints from two lots of ten seconds. Then, once you have mastered two 20-second sprints, add a third before your final cool-down. The whole ‘workout’ should take no longer than four minutes, and should be repeated three times a week. When you are comfortable with three 20-second sprints, move up to 30 seconds of intense activity (the extra ten seconds lasts a lot longer than you think). Start with two lots of 30 seconds and increase to three bursts of activity with a 1-2 minute recovery in between them. Jogging . If you are new to running, go for a brisk walk, breaking into a jog for your timed 20 or 30-second ‘sprint’ intervals. As your stamina improves, your ‘sprints’ can be faster or done up hills to intensify the workout. Just make sure you perform three sprints each time. If you are using a treadmill, put the machine at a permanent 1 per cent incline and increase the speed (and incline) as quickly as you can for each timed sprint. Stair climbing . A great activity for bottom and leg toning which intensifies the health benefits of jogging by forcing your body to work against gravity. Find a stairwell in a building with at least four full floors. Ensure your whole foot lands on each step (to avoid straining the Achilles’ tendon in the heel) and walk back down during recovery periods. After a gentle warm-up (walk up and down a couple of flights), sprint hard up the stairs as fast as you can for 20 (building to 30) seconds, then slowly recover as you walk back down. Repeat three times. Cycling . Build intensity into the ride by intermittently switching to a higher gear and cycling very hard uphill for three 20 and then 30-second bursts. Freewheel back down between bursts to catch your breath. Exercise bike . Spend a few minutes pedalling gently, then ramp up the RPM setting to 90 and pedal as hard and fast as you possibly can for 20 seconds before freewheeling for a few minutes to get your breath back. Repeat two more times. You can build RPM to 110 as you get stronger and increase the sprint times from 20 to 30 seconds. Swimming . Challenge yourself to put three fast laps into your routine, but make sure you allow yourself time to catch your breath in between. A 25m length at full pelt is comparable to sprinting for around 30-40 seconds.

"You may just be getting to grips with the concept of 3D cinema. But it appears that technology is already outdated. Britain’s biggest cinema chain is now preparing to unveil the UK’s first 4DX theatre, which features water sprays, gusts of air, fog and strobe lighting inside the auditorium to simulate the weather and scenes on screen. Scroll down for video . 4D cinema audiences wear glasses while being rocked in their seats and hit with elements including water and wind . The new theatres have water-spraying devices at the front and wind machines on the walls add another dimension to audiences' experience . The new Cineworld multiplex in Milton Keynes will also feature moving seats which shake from side-to-side, up and down and rock backwards and forwards, and which are synchronised with the film’s action. Other effects include pumping out bubbles to ‘bring to life the buoyant atmosphere of the scene’. Different scents recreating explosives and coffee are also pumped into the movie theatre, while the seats are equipped with a ‘tickler’ – a small brush that swipes the back of viewers’ legs and which is designed to help bring the audience closer to the drama. Large fans are used to create wind effects ranging from turbulent storms to gentle breezes, while small jets of water are sprayed from the back of seats in front of audiences to simulate rain. The cinema will open on January 30 after taking five months to complete. It includes 140 seats and a curved screen measuring 5.8m x 10.5m – bigger than a double decker bus. The first film to be screened at the cinema will be spy thriller Kingsman: The Secret Service. 4DX cinema chairs have different components not found in traditional seats, such as water-spraying devices and a tickler for viewers' feet . Bubbles are pumped out in 4DX theatres at certain moments to 'bring to life the buoyant atmosphere of the scene' (artists' impression) Audiences in Milton Keynes will get their first taste (and smell) of 4D cinema with Kingsman: The Secret Service . The Cineworld cinema in Glasgow was the first UK multiplex to experiment with ‘immersive cinema’ techniques when it installed 35 vibrating seats into its auditorium in 2012. It is now hoped that more 4DX cinemas, which have been created by South Korean company CJ 4DPlex, will be rolled out across the country in the next two years. Tickets will cost from £13.40 for a standard adult single and £14.90 to watch a 4DX film in 3D. The world’s first 4DX cinema was launched in January 2009 in Seoul, South Korea, and featured a showing of blockbuster sci-fi, Avatar. The technology has since been installed in around 150 theatres across 30 countries including China, Vietnam, Thailand and Mexico, with CJ 4DPlex hoping to have opened more than 1,000 4DX cinemas around the world by the end of next year. The first 4DX theatre in the US was opened at the LA Live auditorium in Los Angeles last year. There are currently around 30 films each year which are screened in 4DX cinemas. While cinema-goers have mostly been impressed by the technology, some have reported feeling sick and being left damp after watching box office hits such as Pirates Of The Caribbean. And there were reports of people becoming nauseous and going temporarily deaf after watching Transformers: Dark Of The Moon, where the major smell was the scent of burnt rubber and explosives. Talking about the 4DX technology, the company say: ‘Movies are now no longer bound by their visual and aural limits. '4DX is the next step in the movie-going evolution taking audiences on a journey into the full feature film. Free yourself from the confines of the flat screen and live the experience with 4DX.’ James Cameron's 2009 film Avatar features elaborate visual effects that led CJ 4DPlex to use it as its first 4DX movie . Some viewers find the 4D cinema experience of films such as Transformers: Dark Of The Moon to be jarring, even causing nausea and temporary deafness . Films in 4D such as Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides use water to immerse moviegoers in the story, though some audience members were left feeling damp and sick . Mooky Greidinger, Cineworld Chief Executive Officer says: ‘We are incredibly excited to be bringing this revolutionary cinematic experience to the UK. ‘Cineworld Milton Keynes will be our first location among many others to come. In 4DX, cinema-goers will become part of the action as sounds, motion, lights and special effects thrill them in their seats. ‘At Cineworld, we are committed to differentiating ourselves – ensuring we are at the forefront of innovation and technology, while giving our customers the most enhanced cinematic experience there is.’ Offerings of 3D movies have increased in the past five years, with many films being shown in IMAX 3D .

"Some women say dating a shorter man isn't an option but Mindie Kniss, whose husband Sean Stephenson  is 2ft 8in tall, couldn't care less. The couple, who are both motivational speakers, met through a mutual friend in 2009 and married in 2012 after Mindie moved to Chicago to be closer to Sean. 'It’s a joy to be married to this woman – not a day goes by when I don’t tell her I love her like 8,000 times,' says Sean. Scroll down for video . Mindie Kniss says she and her husband Sean Stephenson have an 'awesome' sex life . 'People think she’s sweet for being in love with me but they’ve got it wrong, I’m the saint in this marriage – I take care of her.' Despite their happiness the couple have been targeted by internet trolls who suggested that Sean could never satisfy Mindie sexually and that she is with him only for his money. 36-year-old Mindie, who is 4ft 11in, said: 'I had to set the record straight. Just because he's disabled doesn’t mean we don’t have an awesome sex life. 'It wasn’t love at first sight but Sean is one of the most sexual people I have ever met – it’s appalling to suggest that my husband cannot satisfy me sexually and it’s none of their business.' 'I’m the most sexual person I know,' confirms her husband. 'Sex is probably the biggest part of my life.' At 35, Sean is 33.6 inches (2ft 8"") tall with shorter than average legs because of brittle bone disorder . The couple, who met through a friend, were married on September 14, 2012 in Chicago by a film-maker friend . Both halves of the couple are motivational speakers and they live together in Scottsdale, Arizona . Sean was born with Osteogenesis Imperfecta, or, as it is more commonly known, Brittle Bone Disorder. Aged 35, he is just 33.6in tall and has shorter than average legs due to his condition, which affects bone growth. By the time Sean was 18 he had suffered over 200 fractures to his legs, arms, neck, collarbone, ankle, femur and nose. His worst accident, which happened when he fell from his wheelchair while walking his dog, broke his skull, ankle, kneecap, thigh and hipbone. 'I can’t just mindlessly go to the store by myself,' says Sean. 'I have to be aware of my surroundings because a little bump or step down from a larger curb could be fatal to me. 'That’s something that’s just a part of my life and it’s also something that brings a lot of gifts too. Nobody forgets Sean Stephenson after they meet him. Sean says it's a 'joy' to be married to Mindie and tells his wife he loves her around 8,000 times a day . Trolls have targeted the couple online and say Sean cannot possibly satisfy Mindie sexually . The couple, pictured with their five-year-old nephew Winston, say their sex life is totally normal . Mindie and Sean also hope people will start to accept that disabled people can and do want sex lives . Six months after the couple first met during a discussion on Facebook, Mindie attended a motivational speaking event in Chicago. Mindie, who then lived in Oregon, said: 'The speaker mentioned Sean Stephenson and said this guy was only 3ft tall but living large. 'He told us that Sean had been on stage with the Dalai Lama and Bill Clinton. I was intrigued enough to actually check him out.' In December 2009, Mindie returned to Chicago and met  Sean for the first time in person. 'We got along very well, and he kissed me at the end of the day,' she remembers fondly. 'I was in such a rush to leave to see my family for the holiday and I was left thinking that Sean was such a playboy.' She returned to Chicago in April 2010 and the pair spent a weekend together in a hotel during which they made love for the first time. 'It was different from having sex with an averaged size person of course - but it wasn’t a problem at all,' says Mindie. Sean and Mindie at work, preparing to record a motivational web blog in their home . Sean thinks that people are uncomfortable with the idea of disabled people having ordinary sex lives . Mindie says some of her normal-sized ex boyfriends had emotional issues that were harder to handle . She has also hit out at people who say she is with Sean solely for money . Sean and Mindie on their wedding day on September 14, 2012 . Mindie received an email from a woman who asked if Sean allowed her to cheat on him to satisfy her needs . Sean proposed in the spring of 2011, at an event in California, USA - with their family and friends looking on from their seats among an audience of more than 100 people. They were married on September 14, 2012 in Chicago by a film-maker friend, and exchanged vows they had written themselves. Despite their happiness, the couple, who now live in Scottsdale, Arizona, still fall victim to internet trolls but have resolved to not let strangers stand in the way of their happiness. 'Most people think I look past his disability, when his physical differences are clearly obvious', says Mindie. There is full acceptance here. We all have challenges - it’s just his are visible. 'There are people I’ve dated in the past who have internal issues that are way harder to deal with.' 'I think people are uncomfortable with the idea that those with disabilities are normal human beings and that they have sexual desires and fantasies and enjoy being touched and touching,' says Sean. 'I think it’s a big statement more abut people not being comfortable with their own bodies and the thought of the disabled having sex lives. ' Sean has had his fair share of challenges and had broken bones more than 200 times by the age of 18 . His worst accident saw him break his skull, ankle, kneecap, thigh and hipbone - leaving him in agony .

"After a month of festive indulgence, the majority of Brits are embarking on a New Year health regime - and fitness companies are coming up with inventive ways to keep us interested. Virgin Active, for one, has created a brand new in-club experience it claims will help participants burn up to 900 calories in just half an hour. But they're not promising it's easy, as they offer The Grid, an obstacle course that forces participants to undergo a series of high-intensity moves... one after the other. Scroll down for video . Virgin Active's The Grid, offers a series of 30-minute, high-intensity classes based on circuit training . Instructors will make participants perform a series of 'primal' movements to tone muscles and build fitness . Forget staring into space as you run aimlessly on a treadmill; the The Grid promises to challenge participants in each of the six primal movements, to twist, pull, lift, bend, squat and lunge. The workout has been broken down into four separate classes, each based on high-intensity training. Trainers say the goal is that members can train for their specific needs, whether it's running for the bus or taking on a gruelling obstacle course such as Tough Mudder. Each class - Fit, Lean, Strong or Active - involves short, sharp circuits, which focus on different parts of the body. The Grid Fit class employs the 'accumulator principle' which means trainers crank up the intensity as it progresses to increase cardiovascular fitness, reduce body fat and improve muscle tone. The 30-minute Grid Lean is based on Tabata, the four minute cardio routine. Based around high-intensity interval training, its designed to help burn calories, reduce body fat and build muscle. The Grid offers four classes, Lean, Fit, Strong and Active, which all tackle different workout issues . The Grid offers training to the new generation of weekend warriors doing obstacle courses like Tough Mudder . For those who want to build up, the Grid Strong promises to improve elasticity and flexibility while creating muscle at the same time. In Grid Active, the class uses the floor as an obstacle course, with participants forced to get through an obstacle to get to the next exercise. Using weights and a large range of movements it claims to be the perfect way to train for increasingly popular challenges such as Tough Mudder. The classes, which all last 30 minutes, could involve heaving tires, throwing ropes or doing press ups . Andy Birch, Head of Exercise & Wellbeing at Virgin Active said: 'When coming up with The Grid concept we wanted to bring consciousness back into the high intensity arena. 'Being more mindful of our movement and drilling this down to help us achieve our goals is key. To bring this to life we wanted to reinvent how people use the equipment and space in our club. 'The Grid emerged as it allows us to programme better for people to move better in the toughest way to get the best results.'","Virgin Active gyms offer four explosive, high-intensity classes .

"Jeb Bush launched a trial balloon attack on presumed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Wednesday evening at the launch of his political action committee, taking aim at her foreign policy credentials and economic message. The Republican businessman currently exploring a presidential bid suggested former Secretary of State Clinton should be held responsible for the foreign policy blunders of the Obama administration, according to an attendee of the Greenwich, Connecticut, event. Speaking more generally, Bush said, ‘If someone wants to run a campaign about 90s nostalgia, it’s not going to be very successful,’ the source told a reporter for Hearst Connecticut Media Group. Scroll down for video . Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, pictured here in December at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council, tested out attacks on Hillary Clinton at the launch of his leadership Political Action Committee (PAC) Right to Rise last night . Former President Bill Clinton and Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are pictured here on Tuesday at the funeral of ormer New York Governor Mario Cuomo at St. Ignatius Loyola Church on Park Ave. in Manhattan. Clinton has not announced her candidacy for president yet but she is already the Democratic frontrunner . Clinton's husband, Bill, held the title of president during the last seven years of the '90s, and the era is often associated in the U.S. with economic prosperity. In her previous presidential campaign, the former first lady sought to tap into her husband's popularity and wield it to her advantage, telling voters, 'I’ve apprenticed, and I’ve learned how to do it. I have watched it being done for eight years … It took a Clinton to clean up after the first Bush, and it’ll take a Clinton to clean up after the second Bush.' While longing for years gone by wasn't enough to propel Clinton to victory over Barack Obama in the 2007 Democratic primary, her association with the 'Last Great Decade' did resonate voters. 'During the Clinton administration, we were thriving,' one Pennsylvania resident told a reporter for McClatchy-Tribune at the time. 'We had a home, two cars and my husband had a good job. After the Republicans came in, we lost the house and one of the cars. It was like we lost everything.' This time around Clinton has kept her political speeches in close alignment with economic initiatives favored by the Obama administration and progressive groups such as equal pay for equal work and paid family leave. But in a face-off against Bush, whose father lost the presidency to Bill Clinton after only one term and brother exited the Oval Office amid a sky-high unemployment rate, '90s comparisons would likely resurface in Clinton's stump speeches. That's if either Bush or Clinton competes for the Oval Office at all. Neither have officially declared their candidacies, although both are expected to early in the year. Jeb is pictured here in Austin, Texas,  earlier this month with his son George P. Bush at George's swearing in ceremony as Texas Land Commissioner. To Jeb's left is his wife, Columba, and at the far right is George's wife Amanda. Jeb has not officially announced his candidacy for the Republican nominiation for president but he is 'actively exploring' a bid . In preparation for a possible head-to-head challenge with Clinton, Bush is already readying attacks on the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. Ahead of the midterm elections, Bush went after Clinton over her argument that corporations and businesses don't create jobs. Clinton's camp swiftly clarified that she meant to say 'our economy grows when businesses and entrepreneurs create good-paying jobs,' but the damage was already done. Bush used the verbal gaffe to highlight his own business acumen. 'Well, the problem in America today is that not enough jobs are being created. They are created by businesses where people’s income rise where they can live a life of purpose and meaning independent of government,' he told a group of Republicans at a Colorado rally. 'That should be the mission,' he continued. 'And the only way that we do that is to create a climate of high sustained economic growth where everybody, everybody in this country has a chance at earned success.' After serving two terms as governor of Florida, Bush joined the business world, taking seats on a handful of boards, including Barclays bank and Rayonier. As of last week he had resigned those positions to focus on his presidential campaign. Within hours of his announcement that he would 'actively explore' the presidency, the Democratic National Committee was already imploring its supporters to 'think about how President Bush worked out last time' and comparing Jeb to his brother George, who held the position for eight years directly after Bill Clinton. At the fundraiser on Wednesday evening for his Right to Rise leadership PAC, Bush also reportedly tested out a response to naysayers who don't want a repeat of either Bush presidencies. 'Do you have a father? Do you have a brother? Are you the same person?’ he said, according to the the insider who talked to Hearst.","‘If someone wants to run a campaign about 90s nostalgia, it’s not going to be very successful,’ Bush is said to have told a group of his supporters .

"A Saudi blogger will be publicly flogged tomorrow as part of his 10-year jail term for 'ridiculing Islamic religious figures'. Raif Badawi, who co-founded the Free Saudi Liberals website, was arrested in 2012 and sentenced to 1,000 lashes and a decade in prison for insulting Islam on his online forum. His corporal punishment will be carried out after Friday prayers, outside the Al-Juffali mosque in Jiddah, which has earned the grisly nickname 'Chop Chop Square' as the site of executions. Raif Badawi, who co-founded the Free Saudi Liberals website, was arrested in 2012 and sentenced to 1,000 lashes and a decade in prison for insulting Islam on his online forum . The online activist was found guilty of cyber-crime in May last year and ordered by the Jiddah Criminal Court to pay a fine of 1 million Saudi riyals, or about £175,900. He was also charged with apostasy, which carries the death penalty in the Saudi Kingdom, but he was cleared of this crime in 2013. Badawi called his family from prison and informed them of the flogging, according to the Associated Press. Amnesty International said Badawi would receive 50 lashes on Friday and the rest of the sentence would be carried out over a period of 50 weeks. A whip, a leather strap or a long cane may be used to carry out floggings in Saudi Arabia (pictured) 'It is horrifying to think that such a vicious and cruel punishment should be imposed on someone who is guilty of nothing more than daring to create a public forum for discussion and peacefully exercising the right to freedom of expression,' said Philip Luther, Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa director. He will be publicly flogged tomorrow as part of his 10-year jail term for 'ridiculing Islamic religious figures' A whip, a leather strap or a long cane may be used to carry out floggings in Saudi Arabia, according to corpun.com, a website dedicated to the study of corporal punishment. 'Sometimes the lashes are confined to the buttocks, more often it seems they are spread out from the neck to the ankles, and usually with the prisoner simply lying face down on the ground. 'In one or two reports the offender was said to be tied upright to a post,' said corpun.com. Badawi was originally sentenced in 2013 to seven years in prison and 600 lashes, but after an appeal, the judge stiffened the punishment. Following his arrest, his wife and children left the kingdom for Canada. Badawi's lawyer Waleed Abul-Khair was sentenced in July to 15 years imprisonment and barred from traveling for another 15 years after being found guilty by an anti-terrorism court of 'undermining the regime and officials,' ''inciting public opinion' and 'insulting the judiciary.' Saudi Arabia's legal code follows Sharia Muslim law. Judges are trained as religious scholars and have broad scope to base verdicts and sentences on their own interpretation of religious texts.","Online activist Raif Badawi will be publicly flogged at Jiddah mosque .

"It is a tale of two black holes. A new high-energy X-ray image from NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, or NuSTAR, has pinpointed the true monster of a galactic mashup. The image shows two colliding galaxies, collectively called Arp 299, located 134 million light-years away. The black hole located at the right of the pair is actively gorging on gas, while its partner is either dormant or hidden under gas and dust.  In this image, X-rays with energies of 4 to 6 kiloelectron volts are red, energies of 6 to 12 kiloelectron volts are green, and 12 to 25 kiloelectron volts are blue. The new X-ray data from NuSTAR - overlaid on a visible-light image from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope - show that the black hole on the right is, in fact, the hungry one. As it feeds on gas, energetic processes close to the black hole heat electrons and protons to about hundreds of millions of degrees, creating a superhot plasma, or corona, that boosts the visible light up to high-energy X-rays. Meanwhile, the black hole on the left either is 'snoozing away,' in what is referred to as a quiescent, or dormant state, or is buried in so much gas and dust that the high-energy X-rays can't escape. Nasa's NuSTAR instrument found that the black hole located at the right of the pair is actively gorging on gas, while its partner is either dormant or hidden under gas and dust. The findings are helping researchers understand how the merging of galaxies can trigger black holes to start feeding, an important step in the evolution of galaxies. 'When galaxies collide, gas is sloshed around and driven into their respective nuclei, fueling the growth of black holes and the formation of stars,' said Andrew Ptak of Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, lead author of a new study accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal. 'We want to understand the mechanisms that trigger the black holes to turn on and start consuming the gas.' NuSTAR is the first telescope capable of pinpointing where high-energy X-rays are coming from in the tangled galaxies of Arp 299. Previous observations from other telescopes, including NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton, which detect lower-energy X-rays, had indicated the presence of active supermassive black holes in Arp 299. However, it was not clear from those data alone if one or both of the black holes was feeding, or 'accreting,' a process in which a black hole bulks up in mass as its gravity drags gas onto it. The new X-ray data from NuSTAR - overlaid on a visible-light image from Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope - show that the black hole on the right is, in fact, the hungry one. As it feeds on gas, energetic processes close to the black hole heat electrons and protons to about hundreds of millions of degrees, creating a superhot plasma, or corona, that boosts the visible light up to high-energy X-rays.

Meanwhile, the black hole on the left either is 'snoozing away,' in what is referred to as a quiescent, or dormant state, or is buried in so much gas and dust that the high-energy X-rays can't escape. 'Odds are low that both black holes are on at the same time in a merging pair of galaxies,' said Ann Hornschemeier, a co-author of the study who presented the results Thursday at the annual American Astronomical Society meeting in Seattle. The system consists of a pair of galaxies, dubbed NGC 3690 (or Arp 299), which made a close pass some 700 million years ago. As a result of this interaction, the system underwent a fierce burst of star formation. In the last fifteen years or so six supernovae have popped off in the outer reaches of the galaxy, making this system a distinguished supernova factory. Arp 299 belongs to the family of ultra-luminous infrared galaxies and is located in the constellation of Ursa Major, the Great Bear, approximately 150 million light-years away. It is the 299th galaxy in Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies. Despite its enormous amount of absorbing dust, enough violet and near-ultraviolet light leaks out for it to be number 171 in B.E. Markarian's catalog of galaxies with excess ultraviolet emission. 'When the cores of the galaxies get closer, however, tidal forces slosh the gas and stars around vigorously, and, at that point, both black holes may turn on.' Nasa says NuSTAR is ideally suited to study heavily obscured black holes such as those in Arp 299. High-energy X-rays can penetrate the thick gas, whereas lower-energy X-rays and light get blocked. Ptak said, 'Before now, we couldn't pinpoint the real monster in the merger.'","Galaxies, collectively called Arp 299, are 134 million light-years away .

"Tourists who bring their own parasols to popular beaches on the picturesque Thai island of Phuket are being forced to sit in designated areas under a pilot project announced this week. Holidaymakers who take the ‘bring-your-own-umbrella’ approach will not be allowed to sit wherever they please amid ongoing complaints about ‘clutter’ on beaches. Provincial officials are testing the idea of setting aside 10 per cent of space at each of the island’s most popular beaches for umbrellas and hired mats, Phuketwan reported. Tourists relax on Kata beach as local officials measure one of the designated zones for umbrellas . Umbrellas will be restricted to just 10 per cent of Phuket beaches under a new pilot project . The scheme will be tested first at Kata beach before it is rolled out at other beaches, including all of those in the Phuket city district. Somkiet Sangkaosutthirak, Phuket’s vice-governor, and baffled tourists watched on Wednesday as officials marked an area measuring 32ft by 82ft. Tourists who bring their own umbrellas will be confined to seven of the zones on Kata beach and each will have a kiosk where they can hire parasols and mats, but not sunloungers, Phuketwan reported. Massage vendors will be allowed to operate within the designated zones. The scheme will be tested first at Kata beach before it is rolled out at other beaches, including Phuket city . Tourists with their own parasols will be herded into areas shared by beach and massage vendors . Nisit Jansomwong, the region’s governor, wants to trial the scheme for three months before deciding whether to continue it. In November, holidaymakers were left stunned and outraged when armed police officers raided Surin beach in Phuket to seize their personal parasols and sunloungers. The incident occurred amid confusion about a local beach furniture ban that applied only to vendors. It led to an angry confrontation with some holidaymakers arguing and refusing to take down their umbrellas.","Those with their own brollies will not be allowed to sit where they please .

"A viral video is causing uproar online for giving step by step instructions on how to avoid a DUI arrest. The lawyer who created the controversial method says he's just trying to prevent false arrests, but safe driving advocates think it encourages drunk driving. The video posted on New Year's Day, one of the most dangerous days for drunk driving, shows a Levy County, Florida man preparing to enter a DUI checkpoint by putting his license, insurance and a flyer in a plastic bag. Scroll down for video . Your get out of DUI kit: A viral video shows you how to avoid arrest for drunk driving at a DUI checkpoint. It advises drivers to put their ID, insurance and a flyer that reads 'I remain silent, no searches, I want my lawyer' in a plastic bag and then rolling the window up for police officers to inspect . Above, a detailed view of the flyer, which details the driver's rights including the right to remain silent . Doors closed: Leaving the documents outside the vehicle for waiting officers to inspect is crucial the driver in the video explains, since 'the second that you open the window they can say they smell alcohol' The flyer details the driver's rights and reads: 'I remain silent, no searches, I want my lawyer'.' The bag is connected to a string, so that he can roll the window all the way up. Leaving the documents outside the vehicle for waiting officers to inspect is crucial. 'The second that you open the window they can say they smell alcohol or drugs coming from the vehicle and the moment you speak a word they can claim that you speech is slurred,' the man says. As the man pulls up to the checkpoint, a handful of officers walk up to the vehicle and seem baffled by the bag. One officer reads the flyer with the aid of a flashlight, before sending the driver on his way - no questions asked. He even waves goodbye with a smile. For a good cause: A Boca Raton lawyer created the guidelines for the flyer, and says he just wants to protect drivers' rights. Above, a DUI checkpoint officer checks the packet . Bad example? The driver is waved away with no questions. Some have criticized the video for promoting drunk driving . On your way: The officer who let the driver go even waves him goodbye with a smile . Boca Raton lawyer Warren Redlich is the person who wrote the guidelines for the flyer, and says he's just trying to prevent drivers from being wrongly accused of DUI and doesn't encourage drunk driving. 'It's not designed for drunks and I don't think it really works for drunks because you have to follow instructions and drunks aren't good at that,' he told WPTV. But Tara Kirschner, who works for safe-driving organization Dori Saves Lives, was outraged after seeing the video. 'It's not the example we want to set for our youth. we want them to learn how to do the right things,' she said.

"The NFL did not receive a video of Ray Rice knocking out his fiancee in a casino elevator before it was published online after they failed to investigate the case properly, according to an independent review. 'The NFL should have done more with the information it had and should have taken additional steps to obtain all available information about the February 15 incident,' former FBI director Robert S. Mueller III said in a statement after releasing his 96-page report on Thursday. The Ravens running back was only suspended for two games after his arrest for punching his now-wife Janay during a night out at an Atlantic City, New Jersey casino in February. After video of the incident emerged on TMZ, he was released by the team and suspended indefinitely from the league, although the latter decision was ultimately reversed. 'Should have done more': NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, pictured in October, did not see the video of Ray Rice punching his fiancee in an elevator before it emerged online, according to an independent review . In his report, Mueller said he can find no evidence the league received the video of the incident. A law enforcement official previously said he had mailed a DVD to NFL headquarters in April. The report said a review of phone records and emails of NFL employees showed no evidence that anyone in the league had seen the video before Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Rice. The private investigation without subpoena power did not include any contact with the law enforcement official who claimed the DVD had been sent to the league. The officer had also played the Associated Press a 12-second voicemail from an NFL office number dated April 9, in which a woman verifies receipt of the DVD and says: 'You're right, it's terrible.' The official, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to share the evidence, said he took steps to avoid being found or identified by the NFL. 'We have reviewed the report and stand by our original reporting,' said Kathleen Carroll, the AP's executive editor. 'The Mueller team did ask us for source material and other newsgathering information, but we declined. Everything that we report and confirm goes into our stories. We do not offer up reporters' notes and sources.' Brutal: Elevator surveillance cameras caught the moment that Rice punched his then-fiancee Janay in the face in an Atlantic City casino elevator. She can be seen on the floor after the knockout punch . Free agent: Rice, pictured with his wife Janay outside court in November, was initially suspended for two games and then released by the Ravens over the footage. He successfully appealed and is now a free agent . Mueller's report disputed this, saying that investigators 'found no evidence that anyone at the NFL had or saw the in-elevator video before it was publicly shown'. 'We also found no evidence that a woman at the NFL acknowledged receipt of that video in a voicemail message,' Mueller said. Investigators spoke with Goodell and more than 50 NFL employees, all 188 women who had been in the NFL office building on the day of the supposed voicemail, and looked at e-mails from all league officials, many of which contradicted the notion they might have viewed the elevator video. The probe also searched more than 400 NFL employee computers plus mobile phones of top NFL executives. 'We found no evidence the in-elevator video was or had been stored or viewed on a league computer prior to the video's public release,' Mueller said. But Mueller also found the NFL's deference to the law enforcement process involving Rice 'led to deficiencies in the league's collection and analysis of information during its investigation.' The approach 'can foster an environment in which it is less important to understand precisely what a player did than to understand how and when the criminal justice system addresses the event.' Findings: Former FBI Director Robert Mueller, pictured in 2013, concluded in his report, which was released on Thursday, that the NFL had substantial information about the case and could have obtained more . Mueller's report details some of the efforts the NFL made in obtaining the video, but said the league should have taken additional steps to find out what happened inside the elevator. 'League investigators did not contact any of the police officers who investigated the incident, the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office, or the Revel to attempt to obtain or view the in-elevator video or to obtain other information,' the report said. 'No one from the league asked Rice or his lawyer whether they would make available for viewing the in-elevator video they received as part of criminal discovery in early April.' The report also said the league didn't follow up on initial conversations with the Ravens to determine whether the team had more information. The official showed the AP multiple videos from the casino the night Rice was arrested. Those videos included security cameras from inside and outside the elevator and two cellphone videos that included some audio. The league said it considered the video published by TMZ in September to be new evidence meriting an indefinite suspension. Scandal: Janay Rice appeared at a press conference about the incident with her husband in May (pictured) and apologized for her part - later claiming that the Ravens had encouraged her to do so . Its emergence drew renewed backlash to the league from women's organizations, members of Congress and players - all calling for more detail on how the NFL handled the case. Giants owner John Mara and Steelers President Art Rooney, the men appointed by Goodell as liaison's to the investigation, said Mueller made six recommendations that the owners will review.  Rooney and Mara discussed the report's recommendations with Goodell on Thursday. Rooney and Mara agreed that the league's policy on domestic violence was insufficient. 'We were slow to react, and in the case of Ray Rice, the original punishment was insufficient,' their statement said. 'In addition, the steps taken by the NFL to investigate this matter were inadequate. Since then, a new policy concerning domestic violence and other rules for conduct violations have been put into place.' In the wake of the knockout punch video becoming public, Rice was released by the Ravens. He won a legal appeal in November to overturn the indefinite suspension but did not play in the 2014 NFL season and remains a free agent.","Independent review by former FBI director Robert S.

"Lauren Kavanaugh, from Texas, lived in a 4ft x 9ft closet from three to eight years old, only brought out to be tortured. She was rescued by police in 2001 and adopted but struggled to adapt to a normal life. Since then, she has graduated high school and is now studying psychology with the aim of qualifying as a counsellor. A woman whose mother and stepfather tortured her, forced her to live in a wardrobe for five years and allegedly raped her nightly has spoken of her joy at finally being able to move on with her life. Lauren Kavanaugh, now 21 and living in Athens, Texas, lived in a 4ft by 9ft closet from the ages of three until eight, held there by her mother Barbara Atkinson and stepfather Kenny Atkinson. The evil couple called Lauren their 'little secret' – only bringing her out to torture and allegedly her – but were caught when they showed her off to a horrified neighbour who alerted police. When Lauren was pulled from the tiny cupboard at her mother's home in Dallas, Texas, in 2001, she was eight but weighed 25.6 pounds (1st 8lbs), the same as the average two-year-old and was potbellied with malnutrition. She was rushed to surgery where she was fitted with a colostomy bag, but her organs were shutting down. During her stay in hospital, doctors had to use a feeding method devised for Holocaust victims because her body was so starved. Investigators said she also suffered years of sexual abuse - leaving her tiny body so badly damaged that she needed a series of reconstructive surgeries - but because it would be too traumatic for the then-eight-year-old to testify, Barbara and Kenny Atkinson were never convicted of rape. Fortunately, she recovered from the traumatic time and now she is a student who supports other victims of abuse. Barbara and Kenny were convicted of felony injury to a child in 2002 and jailed for life, not eligible for parole until 2031. Scroll down for video .

Lauren's mother Barbara Atkinson and stepfather Kenny Atkinson were convicted of felony injury to a child in 2002 and jailed for life, not eligible for parole until 2031. Recounting her ordeal, Lauren said: 'One day mum was so sick of me sobbing that she grabbed my arm and told me, 'get into the closet.' 'I was huddled in there for hours under a rail of dresses and shirts. I thought it was a punishment. 'There was no water or food, just darkness.' Sometime later, she recalled being pulled out and raped. She was only three. She continued: 'They put country music on blaring to hide my screams. 'After hours of abuse, I was bundled back into the closet, confused and in agony. 'From then on, it became my new home. 'I couldn't do anything in the darkness. I slept in there and had to use it for the bathroom. 'The carpet was drenched in urine and I lay under a thin, wet blanket.' Lauren was forced to live in a 4ft x 9ft closet for five years. She also had to use the space as her bathroom . The carpet was drenched in urine and her only comfort was a thin blanket . Lauren was also tortured and burnt with cigarettes. She said: 'I was weak from hunger and was tied down so I couldn't fight back. 'I had to eat anything I could find in the closet and I was only let out for torture. 'One day, mum ran me a bath and pushed my head under water. 'Another time when I was six, mum put a bowl of macaroni cheese in front of me - she told me I could chew it but then had to spit it out.' Although Lauren was constantly abused, her brothers and sisters were left alone. She admitted: 'Sometimes I could hear them laughing and playing outside.' Lauren had initially been given up for adoption by Barbara as a child and was taken in by a couple called Sabrina and Bill Kavanaugh, but eight months later, the Kavanaughs received a call that Barbara had changed her mind and wanted the little girl back.

The couple fought to keep the child, but during the adoption process, their lawyer had mistakenly never filed the paperwork to terminate Barbara's parental rights. The mistake meant the Kavanaughs lost the custody battle on a technicality, and had to send the little girl back to her mother when she was two years old. Over the next six years, Lauren was subjected to horrific abuse by her mother and stepfather until she was finally rescued. After being found by the police in 2001,  Lauren was re-adopted by Sabrina and Bill. But despite finding a loving family to take care of her, her early trauma had a lasting impact and she would hide food for later, worried it would vanish. Over the next six years, Lauren was subjected to horrific abuse by her mother and stepfather until she was finally rescued . She also did not know how to play with toys, had the mental age of someone much younger and would try and sleep in her wardrobe every night. She said: 'The first time I saw grass I was eight and I thought it was biting my feet and when I had baths I would yell, ""don't drown me.""' She has regularly endured fits of rage, fights at school, self-harming suicide attempts, and seizures when her body sought to block out the painful memories, particularly of the rapes. But she said a fight at school was a turning point because she was put in an alternative school and residential therapy, where she met other abuse survivors and learned she was not alone.

"A cheat was caught by his blonde fiancée when she found a clump of red hair clogging up her Henry hoover. Deron Yapp, 24, initially told Nicola Lyon, 21, that the hair belonged to a friend's furry hat. But Miss Lyon - the mother of his four-year-old son - threw him out before he admitted to having his lover round. Nicola Lyon, 21, (right) found out Deron Yapp was cheating on her when she discovered red hair in a hoover - the couple are pictured here celebrating the christening of their son, Riley, with a cake . Mother-of-one Miss Lyon was doing a spring clean when she found the red hair in her Henry the Hoover . The mother-of-one said: 'His excuse was the straw that broke the camel's back. His lies, coupled with his suspicious behaviour, were too much to handle. 'I kicked him out then, telling him enough is enough. 'It was heartbreaking but I was glad I found out before I married the rat. It was all thanks to Henry the hoover that I discovered his filthy secret.' The couple had been engaged for two years when they hit a rocky patch soon after their son Riley was born. Miss Lyon, from Woodford Green, north-east London said: 'Deron's behaviour changed. He'd say he was nipping to the shops but would go AWOL for hours. I told him, as a dad, he couldn't just come and go as he pleased.' He apologised and said he would take care of Riley for a weekend so she could relax with her parents. Returning home to an empty flat which was a mess, Miss Lyon started cleaning up with her Henry the Hoover. She said: 'I was hoovering our bedroom when Henry started to overheat and shut off. 'On closer I could see it was jammed. I reached down to unpick the nozzle and I could see that it was choked with strands of long red hair - but I was light blonde. ' Miss Lyon pictured with son Riley - she said 'it was all thanks to Henry the hoover I discovered my fiance's filthy secret' Mr Yapp eventually came clean and said 'it was a mistake' which had been 'playing on my mind every day' Miss Lyon said the behaviour of her fiance changed shortly after the birth of their son, Riley . Soon after, Mr Yapp returned home with Riley and she immediately confronted him about the strands of red hair. 'I asked him straight away to explain the knot of hair. 'He had the cheek to tell me it belonged to his friend's furry hat. Unless the hat was made from human hair what he was telling me was almost certainly a big fat lie. I told him he was sleeping on the sofa', she said. It took two months before Mr Yapp confessed to his cheating ways - but there was another shock for Miss Lyon when she discovered his red-haired lover was pregnant. She said: 'He explained he'd been seeing her for a year. I was gobsmacked. 'It was heartbreaking but I was glad I found out before I married the rat. It was all thanks to Henry the hoover that I discovered his filthy secret.' Mr Yapp said: 'Obviously it was a mistake. I admitted it to her - it kept playing on my mind every day.'","Deron Yapp, 24, was caught cheating by his blonde fiancée Nicola Lyon, 21 .

"Tourists from around the world are flocking to a vineyard at the renowned location where the British TV classic Last of the Summer Wine was filmed. While the programme’s popularity helps, the real reason holidaymakers from as far as Argentina and Australia are visiting Holmfirth Vineyard is to witness a grape-growing miracle. Britain’s highest vineyard, located in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, manages to produce wine 840ft above sea level on vines that survive sub-zero temperatures. Holmfirth Vineyard is a draw for tourists as it manages to produce wine 840ft above sea level . It is achieving the feat as the UK wine industry gains credibility with experts and consumers around the world. Long the butt of French jokes, Britain has been recognised as a premium wine-producing region with more than 400 vineyards in England and Wales producing sparkling and still wines, an increase of 50 per cent compared with last year. Holmfirth Vineyard, which has a restaurant and holiday accommodation, is a home-grown success story. It is owned by Ian and Rebecca Sheveling, who met while studying design at university. Located in West Yorkshire, the vineyard uses hybrid vines which can survive sub-zero temperatures . Employee Dean Conway spreads heat-absorbing  pebbles to help the roots thrive and reduce weeds . Ian went into manufacturing and Rebecca designed seats for Formula 1 cars, but they soon decided that they wanted to open a vineyard. In 2006 they bought an old sheep farm and the first vines were planted a year later. Luke Tankard, Holmfirth Vineyard’s general manager and winemaker, said people are interested in its novelty value. He said: ‘I think people want to satisfy their curiosity about how we can make wine on a hillside so high up. ‘When they arrive at the car park, they are hugely surprised. Their first reaction is what a beautiful view it is and then they say: “I didn’t know you could grow grapes up here.” They are amazed. ‘Sometimes the wind and rain is lashing down - we get more bad days than good weather-wise.’ General manager and winemaker Luke Tankard says people are interested in the vineyard's novelty value . Wine production at Holmfirth Vineyard has increased from 2,500 bottles in 2010 to 12,000 last year . Holmfirth Vineyard is drawing even more tourists after seven flats were built in a disused quarry last year. It is now listed alongside those other bastions of northern English viticulture – Driffield, York and Leventhorpe near Leeds. Luke said hardiness is the key to producing wine on the Pennine snow line. For the basic root stock it has selected hybrid vines which thrive in cool climates. Luke said: ‘These vines have to work a lot harder than normal vines, which just like to sunbathe. ‘Ours have to survive frost and attacks in the soil; they can survive temperatures of -25C. Owners Ian and Rebecca Sheveling purchased an old sheep farm and planted the first vines in 2007 . Bottles are sold for £14.99 each to the thousands of visitors who come from near and far . ‘We have turned a huge corner here, both in terms of the quality and the quantity of our wines. After two good summers our sugar and acidity levels are balancing out nicely.’ Holmfirth Vineyard grows several grape varieties, including Solaris, Seyval, Siegerebbe and Madeleine Angevine for white wines. Luke said: ‘The white Solaris wine is our most popular, it’s like England’s answer to Sauvignon Blanc - and it comes out at 12.5 per cent.’ With the rise in popularity the vineyard has grown its footprint to 7,000 vines over seven acres. When the winery was built in 2010 it harvested 2,500 bottles a year. This year the output topped 12,000 bottles which sell for £14.99 each. After being processed the grapes go into stainless steel fermentation vessels for up to six months . Brian Wilde (left), Peter Sallis (middle) and Bill Owen starred in the British sitcom Last of the Summer Wine . Before the wine is bottled the grapes go into a machine to remove the bitter stalk, which is recycled as compost. The grapes are then crushed with the skin and pips being used for pig food before going into stainless steel fermentation vessels for up to six months to develop body and character. Despite the frost, December has been a busy month for maintenance and pruning at the vineyard. Luke said: ‘We are expecting a cold winter, which won’t be much of a problem as the vines will hibernate. ‘But next year what we really want are sunny days with a little light rain at night.’","Holmfirth Vineyard produces wine 840ft above sea level in West Yorkshire .

"It is the first televised show of the awards season, or as co-host Allison Janney put it, the one where you ‘get to see all the stars before they get down to Oscar weight’. But Allison's acerbic wit aside, it is the night when 'the people' get to pick their big winners in showbiz - and coming up trumps were stars Iggy Azalea, Melissa McCarthy and Kaley Cuoco, who were all in attendance at the Nokia Theatre in LA on Wednesday night. First, The Big Bang Theory star Kaley dished out the award for Favourite Comedic Movie Actress to Melissa for the (critically derided, but commercially successful) movie Tammy, and poked fun at the recent controversy surrounding her comments on feminism in Redbook magazine. Scroll down for video... Big win: Melissa McCarthy kicks off the People's Choice Awards as she is named Favourite Comedic Movie Actress, at the event held at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles . Asked by actor Josh Gad whether she should really be presenting an award honoring (gasp) a woman (and not one dedicated to her husband Ryan Sweeting, we presume) Kaley quipped: 'I know, it's part of my apology tour'. Next was Adam Sandler who picked up his ninth award, this time for Favourite Comedic Movie Actor, albeit for the negatively reviewed flop Blended. Parenthood stars Monica Potter and Dax Shepherd presented the award for Favourite Hip Hop Artist – with Dax dryly suggesting they were chosen because ‘we’re in our forties and super white’. Popular gal: Iggy Azalea took home to award for Favourite Hip Hop Artist beating out Nicki Minaj . He's not worthy! Iggy joked that presenter Dax Shepherd had kept her up the night before, because she was watching him on his show Parenthood . Not so Fancy: Iggy admitted she hadn't prepared anything for her speech, so kept it short and sweet as she took home to award for Favourite Hip Hop Artist . Even she looks surprised!

Josh joked if Kaley should be honoring a woman (Melissa McCarthy) at the event, considering her comments on feminism to Redbook magazine . Iggy Azalea won the award, joking that Dax was the reason she was late to the show because she was up all night watching him on Parenthood. ‘I didn’t expect this so I wrote nothing,’ Iggy said, keeping her acceptance speech simple. 'It's definitely not lost on me.' The mood then went from hip-hop to country, as Lady Antebellum took to the stage to perform their new song Freestyle. And country star Hunter Hayes was then named Favourite Male Country Artist. Ellen DeGeneres made a big impressed as she handed the prestigious TV Icon Award to Golden Girls legend Betty White, who received a standing ovation (and was walked to the stage by the super hunky Chris Evans). Presenting: Boyhood star Patricia Arquette gave Matt Bomer the award for Favourite Cable TV Actor . ‘When Melissa McCarthy came up on stage and she said she would stay with us as long as you let her, well you’ve abused the privilege with me!’ Betty said. ‘I cannot possibly say thank you, can you imagine… the People’s Choice… at 93?! Thank you with all my heart,’ she gushed. 2 Broke Girls stars Kat Dennings and Beth Behrs – who hosted the show last year – followed Betty’s triumph, to present the award for Favourite Action Movie Actor. The gong went to Captain America himself, Chris Evans, who seemed genuinely pleased with the result, claiming that he doesn't usually win things. '30 to 40% of the votes came from my mom,' he added. Boyhood actress Patricia Arquette then awarded Matt Bomer with the gong for Favourite Cable TV Actor for his work on White Collar, beating out the likes of Sons Of Anarchy star Charlie Hunnam.

Star of the night: Oscar-nominated actress Amy Adams couldn't wait to get her picture with Betty . Kaley Cuoco was named Favourite TV Comedic Actress, but failed to say anything further on her feminism controversy. ‘The fans at People’s Choice you guys rock! I know most of those votes are from my parents but there you go,' she said, somewhat stealing the same joke from Chris Evans. ‘I love playing Penny I hope to be playing her for many years. And hey if you want to see The Wedding Ringer on January 14th, go for it!' she added, with a shameless plug for her new movie. No wonder she looks happy! Betty was helped to the stage by hunk Chris Evans . First timers: This was the first year that Anna Faris and Allison Janney hosted the ceremony, after losing in their respective categories the year before . Amazingly, Kaley beat Amy Poehler and Melissa McCarthy. Amy Adams arrived on stage talk about actor Ben Affleck, praising him for his charitable efforts that got him voted the Favourite Humanitarian on the night. 'This is very heavy, if anyone breaks into my house… watch out!’ Ben joked before getting serious. Big honors: Big Eyes actress Amy Adams introduced Ben Affleck to the stage, who was named Favourite Humanitarian . Captain Ameri-Phwoar! Hunk Chris Evans took to the stage to accept his award for Favourite Action Movie Actor .

Following Ben, was Entourage star Adrian Grenier who announced Chloe Grace Moretz as the winner of Favourite Dramatic Movie Actress. ‘I would love to dedicate this movie to my Grandmother who passed away last year,’ Chloe said sweetly.

Rightly so, Viola Davis picked up the award for Favourite Actress In A New TV Series, for her hit show How To Get Away With Murder. Viola may have also won the award for best speech, after she thanked ABC producers for casting someone with her 'classic beauty' a surefire dig at the New York Times article that suggested she was otherwise. Mom and daughter? Hosts Anna and Allison looked more like sisters as they took the stage in a number of different outfits on the evening . Gettin' Iggy with it: Azalea later put on a raunchy performance of her new single Beg For It . Showstopper: Iggy got the crowd moving with her new hit, including Kaley Cuoco who seen dancing in the audience . Modern Family star then introduced performer Iggy Azalea, who rapped her way through her new hit Beg For It. The highlight of Iggy's performance though, was how the tune made Kaley Cuoco break out some classic 'dad dancing' in the audience. Ginnifer Goodwin and Jane The Virgin Star Gina Rodriguez were next up, presenting the award for Favourite Movie Actor. Iron Man star Robert Downey Jr. took the honor, and also the award for Favourite Movie Actor in a Drama.

Closing the show on a high note were The Big Bang Theory cast who took home two, for Favourite TV Show (beating Game Of Thrones!) and Favourite TV Network Comedy. First-time hosts (and Mom co-stars) Anna Faris and Allison Janney did a sterling job with their jokes, which included poking fun at huge budget of The Big Bang Theory (the main cast of which demand up to $1 million per episode). The pair joked that not only is the food better than they get on the set of Mom, but The Big Bang Theory cast are also treated to their own 'massage tent'. Probably. And the laughs came thick and fast early on, as Allison told the audience: 'We are completely live, so keep everything clean - especially you Betty White.' Now it's time for you to top that, Amy Poehler and Tina Fey, as The Golden Globes is set to roll on awards season this Sunday. This is the skit!

"It had no catchphrases, no music and not even footage of a supermarket - but Aldi's ad campaign has been named the most memorable of 2014. The clips of customers comparing the price of cheese and tea with better-known brands were recalled more often than Iceland's or Morrisons', despite the rivals hiring Peter Andre and Ant and Dec. It is another coup for the discount brand, which has  beaten more upmarket rivals like Tesco and Sainsbury's to sales targets and industry awards amid the rise of the thrifty weekly shop. Scroll down for video . Spot the difference: Aldi's comparison adverts have helped it become the most memorable brand of last year . Simple: The format features customers comparing two products which they claim taste identical . Aldi's adverts came top of a study by Marketing magazine, which compiles a list every week of how well various firms' ad campaigns are being remembered. The magazine found Aldi's brand was the most consistently well-recalled throughout 2014 as a whole, with an aggregate score of 169 points. It was followed in the supermarket stakes by Morrisons (92 points), Iceland (81 points), Asda (59 points) and Tesco (57 points). The scores were compiled by awarding a brand ten points if it came first in a weekly ranking, nine points if it came second, and so on. Aldi's score meant it hovered on average around seventh place across the year. Aldi won despite its adverts being banned twice last year by the Advertising Standards Authority following complaints by rival supermarket chains. Variety: One Aldi ad. The chain won despite being rapped twice by the Advertising Standards Authority . Fame: Jean Jones, 83, from Middlesborough, kicked off the trend in 2011 by appearing in this tea advert . The most recent ASA decision on December 31 came after Tesco complained an Aldi comparisons misled viewers by being out of date and not relevant to a 'price-sensitive market'. In that case, the ASA banned the advert despite admitting Aldi offered savings because the chain exaggerated how many people had taken part in a brand-swap 'challenge'. The adverts said 84 out of 98 people saved at Aldi compared to Tesco, but only four of those involved had taken part over the full eight weeks stated. Despite this the adverts have warmed the public's hearts since 2011, when one of their first stars became an online sensation. Jean Jones, 83, from Middlesborough, landed the acting job on a whim and said it was her first since she was in a Shakespeare play at the age of 14. 'I buy this tea for my husband,' she told the camera. 'He likes tea. He also likes this one. I don’t like tea. I like gin.' Last year's versions included a woman in a red dress enjoying an ice cream, a hapless fisherman and his daughter with fish fingers and a bearded man eating cheese. No comparison: Iceland's adverts featuring Peter Andre made it to sixth place in the overall list . Festive: Iceland was the second-placed supermarket, with budget brands all jostling for the top spot . The budget German chain was named Grocer of the Year last June for the second time in a row, beating its upmarket rivals to the 'Oscar' of the supermarket world. It wasn't all ordinary people, though - the adverts also include former England manager Graham Taylor drinking Aldi-brand cider and tipping himself back in an armchair. And for its Christmas advert, the firm departed from the usual format and featured BBC presenter and musician Jools Holland. In the overall rankings by Marketing magazine, the famously repetitive and functional DFS sofa adverts came second, while promotional clips for Argos came third. Adverts did not have to be well-liked. Compare the Market and GoCompare, with their meerkats and opera singers, both came in the top ten. Morag Blazey, chief executive of advert analysts Ebiquity UK said: 'We recognise the formula but we are not tired of it; we watch because we know it will be amusing and engaging. 'Other supermarket brands spend more but have a less consistent message.' Third place: Ant and Dec appeared in several adverts for the supermarket chain Morrisons last year . The clips showed the TV stars walking down 'Market Street' and visiting a butcher and a greengrocer . 1. Aldi - 169 points . 2. DFS - 148 . 3. Argos - 142 . 4. Sky TV - 96 . 5. Morrisons - 92 . 6. Iceland - 81 . 7. Gocompare - 72 . 8. Comparethemarket.com - 63 . 9. Confused.com - 62 . 10. Virgin Media - 61 . 11. Asda - 59 . 12. Tesco - 57 . 13. McDonald's - 54 . 14. Marks & Spencer - 51 . 15. Littlewoods - 49 . 16. Muller - 48 . 17. Barclays - 46 . 18. KFC - 45 . 19. Jackpotjoy - 44 . 20. BT - 42 .","Supermarket's simple ads featured shoppers comparing two items .

"With her flowing raven locks, slender figure and rouge lips, 28-year-old Jessie sounds like the type of woman who would easily turn men's heads. However, all is not as it seems, because Jessie is actually a man called Joel who likes to dress up like a living doll. The Essex-born bartender is one of a growing number of people who like to wear rubber suits, which is documented on TLC's My Strange Addiction. Scroll down for video . Joel, a 28-year-old bartender from Essex, loves getting dressed up as a woman - and his girlfriend even helps him get into character . Unlike transgender people, ‘maskers’, or ‘rubber dollers’ as they’re also known, do not feel born in the wrong body. For them, they say dressing up as a member of the opposite sex is a simply a way to have fun. Joel  has been dressing up this way since he was 15 and estimates he has spent £9,900 ($15,000) on suits and masks over the years. He has just moved in with his girlfriend Mel, who is aware of his obsession and supports him. She helps him get ready - and is on hand as he reveals his alter-ego look to some friends for the first time. Men around the world are being  unmasked as those who like to dress up in rubber doll suits on TLC's My Strange Addiction . Joel had just moved in with his girlfriend Mel, who is aware of his obsession and supports him. For Joel, dressing up as a member of the opposite sex is a simply a way to have fun . Mel is even on hand as he reveals his alter-ego look to some friends for the first time . For Joel, dressing up is all about escapism. ‘I get enjoyment out of it, I get a sense of escapism out of it,’ he reveals. ‘I'm just out to have fun. It's like the extension of another persona within me that just wants to go out and have fun. ‘The conundrum is people ask: “What do you do when you get dressed up?” And the answer is: not much. ‘Sometimes I just take photos to put up on masking websites, other times it just happens to be who I want to be that day.’ For Joel, pictured without his get-up on, dressing up is all about escapism . Supportive Mel helps Joel get into character on the show on TLC . Speaking about why he dresses up, Joel said: 'I get enjoyment out of it, I get a sense of escapism out of it' But Joel’s masking career hasn’t always gone smoothly. While girlfriend Mel is happy to accept his alter-ego Jessie, he spent 15 years hiding her from his parents – and from his neighbours. ‘I wouldn't walk 20 steps down the road dressed as a doll because I know general society in the area we live in would be very, very against it,’ he explains. ‘Who knows what could happen?’ The show also feature 70-year-old 'Robert' from Newport Beach, California, who had hidden his addiction for 12 years. He loves to dressed as Sherry in a rubber suit and blonde wig and is part of a huge online community. Joel, pictured getting dressed up with the help of Mel, explained: 'I'm just out to have fun. It's like the extension of another persona within me that just wants to go out and have fun' Joel has spent thousands of pounds on the outfits he wears and has different wigs to go with each one . The show's cameras follow Robert as he travels to the Rubber Doll World Rendevous in Minneapolis for the first time to meet his online pals, many of whom are married with children but who all love to dress up in their silicone alter-egos too. But while many of the maskers who appear in the documentary say it’s all about having fun; for 70-year-old Robert, matters don’t appear quite so simple. 'That's why I do this,’ he breathes as he pouts at his reflection in the bathroom mirror, ‘because I think I look amazing. 70-year-old Robert dresses as a living doll because it makes him look 'amazing . ‘I just can't believe that's a 70-year-old man in the mirror and that's why I do this,’ he continues. ‘If I saw a 70-year-old man in the mirror I would quit this tomorrow. ‘ . Asked what he sees when he looks at his dolled up reflection, he replies: 'An exciting looking female,’ adding: ‘If I saw a woman like this and she asked me to go hang out, I'd say yeah.' For him, the appeal of Sherry seems to lie partly in the fact that for him, dating real women has been something of a disappointment. The show's cameras follow Robert as he travels to the Rubber Doll World Rendevous in Minneapolis . Robert meets his online pals, many of whom are married with children but who all love to dress up in their silicone alter-egos too, for the first time on the show . 'They're not freaky people,  they're just like you and me,' explains Barbie Ramos, the owner of Femskin, a company that makes the $850 (£518) custom-made silicone outfits worn by maskers . Some of the men feel that no one pays attention to them when they're in male mode . ‘You see, after all, I'm 70 years old and I've tried dating, and when I'm dating, the women I meet are generally 55 to well up into their 60s,’ he explains. ‘Some of them are in really good shape for their age but they don't look anything like this and it's very difficult to date when you have this to come home to. ‘They’re not freaky people, they’re not weird, they’re just like you and me,’ explains Barbie Ramos, the owner of Femskin, a company that makes the $850 (about £518) custom-made silicone outfits worn by maskers. ‘They’re just like what they call “vanilla people” - that’s you and me - except for at night or on special occasions, they like to put on a mask. Why not?’ Her son Adam, who also works at Femskin, adds: ‘I don't think it would be fair to call them gay or even attracted to other men.’ ‘It's about fun. A lot of men have fun by pretending to be women. Not all of them even want to be hot. Some want to be nasty hags.’ The show's cameras follow Robert as he travels to the Rubber Doll World Rendevous in Minneapolis for the first time to meet his online pals, many of whom are married with children but who all love to dress up in their silicone alter-egos too . Vanessa, left, said: 'When I dress up, put this mask on and the wig, it's like being a beautiful woman' 'Vanessa', left, a 56-year-old who is father of six, says he feels like a beautiful woman in the outfit . One masker who is far less reticent about his hobby is Jon, a Minneapolis father-of-six who works as a forklift driver in a warehouse. According to Jon, not only does masking make him feel good, it also helps him to bond with his daughters. ‘I try to find ways to fit in and be involved with the daughters, and that sometimes means make-up and fingernails and things like that as well,’ he explains. ‘You don't have to have your guard up and necessarily be afraid of other people if you want to dress in a way that makes you feel really good. ‘One guy in particular that I trust at work - he knows that I put on the boobies!’ The show documents some of the maskers meeting each other for the first time . Adam Ramos, who works at Femskin with his mother, said: 'I don't think it would be fair to call them gay or even attracted to other men' But not everyone is quite so understanding. Jon’s wife Sunny is his second, met and wed after his first marriage broke up because of his penchant for rubber dolling. ‘This does affect my relationships because I make my priorities and sometimes other people are not happy about my choices,’ he admits. So is it all worth it? Jon’s friend ‘Vanessa’, a 56-year-old who is also father of six, thinks it is. ‘When I'm in my male mode, I go out in public and I just blend in,’ he confesses. ‘When I walk down the street, people don't pay any attention to me. ‘But when I dress up, put this mask on and the wig, it's like being a beautiful woman walking down the street. ‘You become one of the beautiful people and you draw a lot of attention, and attention is not something I've had a lot of.’ My Strange Addiction on TLC .","Stars of TLC documentary, My Strange Addiction .

"A TV reporter in Colorado has been hospitalized with frostbite to his fingers after trying to film a late-night live shot during freezing temperatures. Eric Fink, a reporter for KRDO in Colorado Springs, was wearing cold-weather clothing while preparing to film a live shot on his own on Saturday night but ran into difficulties with his equipment. He told his producers that he needed to remove his gloves in order to connect his camera to the backpack, but that he was worried about taking them off in freezing winds, Mediabistro reported. But he removed them - as temperatures plunged to 11F (-11.7C) with a wind chill of 3F (-16C). Hospitalized: Eric Fink, a reporter for KRDO in Colorado Springs, is pictured receiving treatment in hospital after he suffered frostbite while reporting in freezing temperatures on Saturday night . The station would not comment on whether Fink was reporting on the weather at the time or on a different local story. Another KRDO reporter tweeted a photograph showing Fink receiving treatment for several frostbitten fingers on Sunday. 'How cold is it? Reporter @E_FINKSTER has frostbite on both hands after working in Falcon,' reported Jonathan Petramala tweeted. On Wednesday, Fink, 27, took to his own Twitter feed to give followers an update. 'Recovering from frostbite,' he wrote. 'I am overwhelmed by the prayers and support. Tweeting a heartfelt thank you to everybody.' Recovering: Fink, pictured, needed to take off his gloves in sub-freezing temperatures to fix his equipment . On the mend: On Wednesday, he told his Twitter followers that he was on the road to recovery . Ahead of the incident, KRDO had been warning viewers to bundle up against the sub-zero temperatures, warning them of the risks of frostbite. Mediabistro reported that the station's journalists had criticized KRDO for a lack of weather safety training. 'No one was surprised that something bad was going to happen during spot news or weather, we'd just hoped it wouldn't lead to someone potentially losing fingers as a result,' an insider told the site. Staff from KRDO declined to comment on the incident. Temperatures plunged in Colorado on Saturday during a cold front that lumbered across the U.S., and the temperature in Colorado Springs dropped from 30F to 20F in just one hour that afternoon. Freezing: The channel has been warning viewers about the freezing temperatures across Colorado Springs. It was 11F (-11.7C) with wind chills when Fink tried to film his shot on Saturday night . Frostbite happens when skin is exposed to freezing temperatures – typically any temperature below 31ºF. It can affect any part of your body, but hands, feet, ears, nose and lips, are most likely to be affected. To avoid frostbite: . The very young and very old are most at risk of frostbite as their bodies are less able to regulate body temperature. Smokers and diabetics are also at risk. During cold weather alcohol can be a factor in frost bite - it causes you to lose heat at a faster rate. The symptoms of frostbite usually begin with the affected parts feeling cold and painful. If exposure to the cold continues, you may feel pins and needles. If the tingling in the fingers and toes doesn't stop, or there are at least 30 minutes of symptoms and no feeling in the extremities, you should seek medical attention.","Eric Fink, 27, needed to remove his gloves to fix equipment while filming alone in Falcon, Colorado on Saturday night .

"A director from the Indonesian search-and rescue agency said readings detected on Friday suggest the black box may be outside the tail section of the plane. It comes as footage has emerged showing Indonesian military divers investigating the submerged tail of doomed AirAsia flight 8501, as search and rescue teams are hopeful that  the black box from the plane's wreckage has been located. Having located the tail of the plane on Thursday, search teams began pressing ahead with their efforts to find the black box and retrieve bodies from the wreckage, and on Friday afternoon reported detecting 'pings' from the flight data recorder. But Suyadi Bambang Supriyadi, director of operations of Indonesia's search-and-rescue agency, said pings detected about 1km southwest of the wreckage suggest the black box may be located elsewhere, reports Business Spectator. New footage has emerged showing Indonesian military divers investigating the tail of AirAsia flight 8501 . The underwater searches ended before dusk on Friday, after divers were unable to find the black box. Indonesian authorities have warned that the black box, which is located in the tail in the Airbus A320-200, may have become separated during the crash. Footage released by Indonesian authorities shows divers surrounding the submerged wreck, shining torches into the badly damaged hull, 30 metres under the surface of the Java Sea. The flight data recorder, or black box, which is located in the back end of the plane, could prove crucial to determining the cause of the December 28 crash that killed all 168 people on board. Lifting balloons were loaded onto helicopters in preparation of recovery efforts to lift the tail out of the Java Sea, despite worries that the black box may have been separated from the tail during the crash. The footage was captured by the divers despite poor weather and murky water which has been hampering recovery efforts. The footage shows elite divers holding a box to the exterior of the tail, which still has the identifying markers 'PK' plane on its side. An Indonesian Armed Forces Commander confirmed that a recovery of the tail is in progress, after signals from the black box, which only has 30 days of battery life, were detected yesterday. The divers hop to locate the flight data recorder and retrieving more bodies of the crash's victims . Footage released by Indonesian authorities shows divers surrounding the submerged wreck of the tail . Divers are shown shining torches into the badly damaged hull, 30 meters under the waters of the Java Sea . Navy ships USS Sampson and USS Fort Worth have deployed helicopters and sonar devices into the Java Sea to aid the recovery operation off the coast of the Indonesian island of Borneo. Only 43 bodies have been retrieved so far, as monsoon rains and winds have caused choppy sea conditions and blinding silt from river run-off, reducing visibility underwater and preventing the removal of large pieces of the wreckage. Many of the other passengers are believed to be inside the wreckage of the plane's main cabin, which has not been located, due to strong currents moving debris around. At two weeks, most corpses will sink, said Anton Castilani, head of Indonesia's disaster identification victim unit, and there are already signs of serious decomposition. 'Divers have reached the tail part but ... the visibility was below one metre so they only managed to retrieve various debris,' said Bambang Soelistyo, chief of Indonesia's search and rescue agency. 'Now we are waiting for the speed of the current to ease. If it gets calmer later, they will go back to do another dive to determine whether the black boxes remained in the tail or were detached,' Mr Soelistyo said on Thursday. Divers travelled by rubber boat from the KRI Banda Aceh warship that was being stationed close to the site of tail wreckage . Indonesian navy divers arrive on their inflatable boats after conducting operations to lift the plane's tail . Retrieval experts are hoping to lift the tail on Friday if weather conditions are fine . Divers travelled by rubber boat from the KRI Banda Aceh warship that was being stationed close to the site of tail wreckage, which Mr Soelistyo said would be lifted off the seabed by retrieval experts on Friday if weather permitted. Lieutenant. Edy Tirtayasa, commander of Indonesia's navy rescue team, told Channel News Asia they planned to send two contingents to the plane. 'We are going to send down one observation team to take photos. Then two teams will do the recovery process -- to recover bodies if there are any,' he said. 'If not, they will recover the black box for investigation and then other debris from the aircraft, he said. Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs Indroyono Soesilo told reporters the black box would be analysed by experts in Indonesia when it was located . Lieutenant.

It will provide essential information about the plane along with final conversations between the captain and co-pilot, despite the Indonesian meteorological agency indicating that weather was the 'triggering factor' of the crash, with ice likely damaging the engines of the Airbus A320-200. Five other big objects have been found on the floor of the ocean, though no visual confirmation has been obtained yet. Smaller pieces of the plane, such as seats and an emergency door, have been collected from the surface. Tony Fernandes, AirAsia's chief executive officer, welcomed the news. Navy personnel carry air balloons into a NC212 aircraft at Juanda airbase . Inclement weather has hampered recovery efforts by Indonesian and international personnel . AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes said that the airline's priority was the recover the bodies of the victims . If it is the right part of the tail section, he tweeted, then the cockpit voice and flight data recorders, or black boxes, 'should be there'. He said the airline's priority still is to recover all the bodies 'to ease the pain of our families'. Families of the victims whose bodies have been recovered held funeral ceremonies on Thursday to lay their loved ones to rest. Family members and friends buried their bodies and lay flowers over the graves, bringing photos of the victims to lay at memorial sites. The National Search and Rescue Agency found four more bodies on Friday, bringing the total body count to 48. Divers found the bodies strapped to their passenger seats.

The recovery operation comes as news that the families of the victims of the flight will be offered $US100,000 in compensation by the airline. An offer of $US24,000 was presented to family members, who were given a draft letter from AirAsia, which detailed its initial compensation deal, CNN reported. Family members have been left confused about the letter's wording and raising issue with the airline approaching families separately in relation to compensation, the Wall Street Journal reported. But Indonesia AirAsia's director of safety and security defended the isolated discussions to The Strait Times on Tuesday, saying: 'We respect that [some] families are still hoping to see that their relatives survived, so we offered [compensation first] to those whose family members have been identified'. On Wednesday, searchers looking for the plane say they believe they have found the aircraft's tail . Along with the tail, the fuselage is thought to be with it, off the coast of the Indonesian island of Borneo . The black box is thought to be inside the tail. It will help shed some light on the last moments of the flight before it crashed . Captain Raden Achmad Sadikin added the airlines would be compensating families in line with Indonesian policy. According to the regulatory body that is responsible for Indonesia's finance sector, agencies that insure airlines were liable to give 1.25 billion rupiah for every one of the 155 passengers including 315 million rupiah to 750 million rupiah for the 25 passengers who bought flight insurance. Just before losing contact, the pilot told air traffic control he was approaching threatening clouds, but was denied permission to climb to a higher altitude because of heavy air traffic.

Britain’s wartime Prime Minister commissioned a custom made green velvet all-in-one suit designed especially to be worn in the bunker. So beloved were his all-in-one 'siren' suits, named in reference to the fact that they put on with ease during an air-raid, that he ordered 12 of them. They are perhaps more commonly associated with pop starlets and reality television stars - but the true pioneer of the onesie was Winston Churchill according to a new exhibition . Britain’s wartime Prime Minister had a custom made all-in-one suit designed especially to be worn in the bunker . But these weren't just any old onesies - handmade by gentleman's outfitters Turnbull & Asser, they came in pinstripe, and in the style of an Army dress uniform. The Royal Warrant shirtmaker is apparently hoping for a revival of the one piece suit and is planning to make two new siren suits  - a city and country version - at £3,000 a piece. Churchill's love of science and innovation extended to much more than his fondness for romper suits - and is to be celebrated at a new exhibition at London’s Science museum. Marking the 50th anniversary of his death, Churchill’s Scientists tells the little-known story of how Churchill’s fascination with science led to the scientific achievements that helped Britain win the Second World War. Churchill's 'romper suits' weren't just any old onesies - handmade by gentleman's outfitters Turnbull & Asser, they came in denim and pinstripe, and in the style of an Army dress uniform . The siren suit is included in the exhibition to mark how Churchill was dressed when he first met his scientific advisers Reginald Jones - who mistook him for a maintenance man . He was the first Prime Minister to take on a scientific advisor, and gave scientists unprecedented access to funding. The siren suit is included in the exhibition to mark how Churchill was dressed when he first met his scientific adviser Reginald Jones, who was so baffled by the outfit, he assumed the Prime Minister was a maintenance man, The Times reports. Churchill’s Scientists opens at The Science Museum on January 23, marking the 50th anniversary of his death . 'I imagined him to be a Ministry of Works maintenance engineer who had inadvertently strayed into the room while looking for some domestic installation such as a hot water radiator... but to my surprise he turned out to be the Prime Minister in his famous siren suit.' Andrew Nahum, lead curator of Churchill’s Scientists, told the Telegraph: 'During the war the question was never how much will it cost? It was can we do it and how soon can we have it? This left a heritage of extreme ambition and a lot of talented people who were keen to see what it could provide.

"Bill Cosby's TV wife Phylicia Rashad has claimed she was misquoted in an interview discussing the mounting accusations against him - before claiming the allegations are just an orchestrated effort to keep him off television. In an interview that was published on Showbiz411 on Tuesday, Rashad was quoted as saying 'Forget these women' - referring to the more than two dozen women who have stepped forward in recent months to accuse the comedian of drugging and sexually assaulting them. But in another interview that aired on Wednesday night, she told ABC that she had been misquoted. 'That is not what I said,' Rashad, 66, explained. 'What I said is, ""this is not about the women. This is about something else. This is about the obliteration of legacy"".' Scroll down for videos . Denial: Phylicia Rashad said in an interview with Nightline on Wednesday, pictured, that she did not tell people to 'forget' Bill Cosby's accusers but instead wanted them to focus on his damaged legacy . She went on: 'I am a woman. I would never say such a thing. I would never think such a thing.' Rashad, who played Clair Huxtable in the long-running Cosby Show, said she never saw anything inappropriate while they worked together and that Cosby's wife, Camille, would often visit the set. So when she heard the first allegations against him, she was suspicious, she said. 'My initial reaction to the allegations was, ""Hmm someone has a vested interest in preventing Cosby's return to network television"",' she said. Although she has not spoken to him recently, she said that no doubt the accusations have 'not been easy' for Cosby. 'I did talk to him towards the beginning of all of this and his comment was the internet has given some anonymous people a very loud voice,' she said. 'It's difficult for me to watch this legacy be erased, as if [it] never happened... I think in the hearts and minds of people he is still held in high regard.' Co-stars: Cosby and Rashad as the Huxtables in the long-running Cosby Show for which she won an Emmy . Old friends: Rashad, pictured with Bill Cosby in September 2011, said he told her that the internet 'has given some anonymous people a very loud voice' as she defended him in the interview . She also dismissed the suggestion that she was defending him so the show would continue to air and she would receive royalties. She said she no longer receives much money this way. Her interview came after comments appeared on Roger Friedman's Showbiz 411 column on Tuesday, sparking uproar. 'Forget these women,' she was quoted as saying. 'What you're seeing is the destruction of a legacy. And I think it's orchestrated.' Director Judd Apatow, who has posted a stream of tweets denouncing Cosby and those who have rushed to his defense, tweeted on Wednesday: 'Phylicia - how many women need to be raped before you realize he destroyed his own legacy? 40? 50? For me it's one.' After the outcry, Friedman published another post on Wednesday night saying he was removing the 'forget these women' line from his interview because he thought it had been misconstrued. 'I did not misquote Phylicia Rashad,' he said. 'But she didn't mean for it to be taken the way it was, and I should have punctuated... She meant, ""those women aside"" – as in, she's not talking about that, she's talking about Cosby's legacy being destroyed.' Cosby's career unraveled after his accusers came forward, with a TV project halted and at least 10 stand-up comedy tour performances canceled or indefinitely postponed. Thin crowd: On Wednesday, he returned to the stage for a show in Kitchener, Ontario. His stage is pictured before he went on - showing images of him with Nelson Mandela and many empty seats . Return to the stage: Cosby is pictured on Wednesday during his standup show, which was not disrupted . Anger: Outside the theater, in sub-freezing temperatures, crowds gathered to protest the comedian . The 77-year-old, who has been accused of drugging or sexual abuse by more than 20 women, including models Janice Dickinson and Beverly Johnson, has denied the allegations. Cosby, who starred as Dr. Cliff Huxtable on The Cosby Show from 1984 to 1992, earning a reputation as 'America's Dad,' has never been charged in connection with any of the allegations, and through his representatives he has denied them. A 2005 lawsuit by a Pennsylvania woman was settled before it went to trial. Scandal-plagued Cosby returned to the stage in Ontario on Wednesday night for the first time since November - and was met with empty seats and a sea of protesters brandishing signs reading: 'Rape is no joke.' Wearing a sweater saying 'hello friend,' Cosby performed his set beneath two giant posters showing him with Nelson Mandela. There were no disruptions during the performance. But as he was leaving the Centre In The Square Theatre following the performance, a heckler approached Cosby, who was well guarded by security and other entourage members. 'Congratulations on your first show of 2015. Talk about starting the year with a bang! We hope it was consensual, Billy!,' the man can be heard shouting out in a video captured by NBC. More voices: Three women who allege they were sexually assaulted by Cosby, Lynn Neal, Linda Kirkpatrick and 'Kacey' sit with lawyer Gloria Allred on Wednesday as they stepped forward to accuse him of attacks . The three performances in Canada come after Cosby saw at least 10 performances get canceled on his North American tour. He next appears at the Budweiser Gardens in London, Ontario, on Thursday and at the Hamilton Place Theatre in Hamilton, Ontario, on Friday. Hours before he took the stage, attorney Gloria Allred said three more women are accusing him of drugging and sexually assaulting them in Las Vegas or Los Angeles between 1981 and 1996. Allred said at a news conference in Los Angeles that the accusations are too old for criminal charges or lawsuits.

"The Ministry of Defence has been forced to ask the US for help as it hunts for a suspected Russian submarine believed to be lurking off the coast of Scotland. Two U.S Navy aircraft were this week drafted in to carry out patrols in the North Atlantic in a bid to bridge the 'gaping chasm' in Britain's anti-submarine capability. It comes after the RAF's £4bn fleet of 'spy-in-the-sky' Nimrod surveillance aircraft was controversially scrapped in 2010, amid warning it would weaken Britain's defences. Scroll down for video . The Ministry of Defence has been forced to ask the US for assistance as it hunts for a suspected Russian submarine believed to be lurking off the coast of Scotland (stock image of Russian submarine) The latest operation follows a recent surge in Russian naval and airforce activity (shown in graphic above) Experts said the latest request for assistance raises questions about the UK's ability to adequately protect its nuclear submarines. And Angus Robertson, the Scottish National Party's defence spokesman, said the deployment showed Britain had resorted to going to its allies with a 'begging bowl'. The U.S P3 Orion maritime patrol aeroplanes, which are currently based at RAF Lossiemouth, were deployed on the trail of the mystery vessel this week. The crews worked alongside the Royal Navy's anti-submarine frigate HMS Somerset, which has been operating off Scotland for a month. The emergence of the Russian submarine is said to be linked to the alleged departure from Faslane Naval base of one of the Royal Navy's Vanguard-class nuclear submarines, which carries Trident missiles. The base, at Gare Loch on the River Clyde, is the home of the UK's ballistic missile submarines. Peter Roberts, a senior fellow of the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies, told The Independent: 'HMS Somerset is a capable platform and I have no doubt that her deployment alongside these U.S Navy aircraft is related to the reported departure of a Royal Navy Vanguard ballistic missile submarine from Faslane, and the countering of any Russian deployment from over the horizon.' The two U.S Navy P3 Orion maritime patrol aeroplanes were deployed to fill what defence experts described as a 'gaping chasm' in Britain's anti-submarine capability (stock image) The U.S crews co-ordinated searches alongside the Royal Navy's anti-submarine frigate HMS Somerset (pictured), which has been operating off Scotland for one month (stock image) But he added that Ministry of Defence chiefs had been 'scratching their heads' ever since Nimrod was scrapped, adding: 'It has left a gaping chasm in the UK's capabilities and left us highly dependent on co-operation from our allies.' This week's operation follows a deployment last month by maritime patrol aircraft from Canada, France and the U.S. The periscope was sighted in waters where British submarines would normally surface as they head into or out of Faslane. On that occasion, it was also suggested that a suspected Russian submarine may have been trying to track one of Britain's four Vanguard-class boats. Sources said 'visits' from Russian submarines were 'happening quite often' off the north and west coasts of Scotland. Some say the presence of the Russian submarine could be linked to the alleged departure of the Royal Navy's Vanguard-class nuclear submarines (pictured) from Faslane naval base (stock image) In October, Sweden mounted a search for a suspected Russian submarine thought to be operating in its territorial waters. Sweden closed off waters and airspace off Stockholm and warned the public to stay away after the military made three sightings of the mystery vessel. It also said it had picked up three encrypted signals from a suspected submarine it believed to be Russian. One theory was that an experimental Russian mini-sub called the Triton NN had got into trouble on a spy mission in Swedish waters. Although the hunt was unsuccessful, defence officials said there was no doubt that their waters had been violated by a foreign power. Russia denied that any of its forces were involved. In November, the Royal Navy tracked four Russian warships passing through the English Channel. On this occasion The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said that the ships had been escorted out of UK waters by Royal Navy warship HMS Tyne. David Cameron axed the Nimrod MRA4 aerial surveillance planes in October 2010 as part of the Strategic Defence and Security Review. The MRA4 was intended to replace the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR2 and would ensure that no foreign submarines could track Royal Navy vessels coming in and out of Faslane. The MoD had signed a deal with BAE in 1996 to build 21 of the Nimrod planes, only for the contract to be reduced to 12 and then nine aircraft. The request for foreign assistance comes after the RAF's £4bn fleet of Nimrod surveillance aircraft (pictured) was controversially scrapped under David Cameron in 2010 (stock image) Last month, patrol aircraft from four countries were deployed after a suspected Russian submarine was sighted at Faslane naval base (pictured) where is was allegedly tracking one of the Vanguards (stock image) At the point of being scrapped, the project was £789m over-budget and more than nine years late. The political move prompted criticism from top military figures and MPs who warned it would weaken Britain's defences. Even the then Defence Secretary Liam Fox admitted  the move was a 'risk', but ministers pressed on, claiming it would save the MoD £2billion. Meanwhile, Labour leader Ed Miliband this week backed replacing the Trident nuclear weapons system with the 'least-cost deterrent' possible. The submarine-based system is up for renewal in 2016 and the issue could be a key factor in any coalition deal after the May election. The current system involves four submarines, with one armed boat always at sea, operating out of Faslane. A spokesman for the MoD said: 'Tough decisions had to be taken in order to rebalance the Defence budget, which included removing the Nimrod MR2 from service. 'However, maritime surveillance is provided through a combination of layered capabilities including surface ships, submarines, and air assets such as the RAF Hercules which searched for the missing yacht Cheeki Rafiki in May. 'The UK continues to work closely with its NATO allies in the operation of Maritime Patrol Aircraft.'","American P3 Orion planes deployed this week on trail of mystery vessel .

"In Kenya's Maasai Mara, it's every lion for itself. Each day is a battle for survival. Big cats are in rapid decline due to loss and fragmentation of their habitat, a depletion of prey thanks to poaching, retaliatory killing due human wildlife conflict, and ruthless killing by American hunters and Maasai warriors intent on proving their manhood. In the early 1990s Kenya had 7000 lions, but by 2009, the Kenya Wildlife Service reported that there were just over 2000 lions remaining. In fact, lions have become extinct in 26 countries, and wildlife experts warn that the king of the jungle is in crisis. The litter of four cubs, The Luxury Safari Comapany's Il Moran Camp, are thought to be under three weeks . Big cats are in rapid decline due to loss of their natural habitat and hunting. Madomo the lioness pictured . But from The Luxury Safari Company's Il Moran Camp, some good news: Lioness, Madomo has given birth to a litter of four tiny cubs, thought to be under three weeks. The proud mother has hidden her offspring in by a riverbed, where the some of the staff got their first glimpse of them a few days ago. Patrick Reynolds, the manager of Il Moran says, 'At a time when lions are being persecuted, and are seriously endangered, we have exciting news to share! New cubs have been born for the Marsh Pride of lions. At a time when lions are being persecuted, the news from the camp comes as a breath of fresh air . The cubs are hidden in the thickets next to a riverbed, but being so tiny, their lives are hanging in the balance . 'Madomo is originally from the Marsh Pride but when she reached adulthood she and her sisters were pushed out of the pride.' 'They spent their time roaming and existing on the edges of the Marsh Prides territory constantly harassed by the formidable Marsh Pride Lioness Siena.' The cubs' father is a nomadic lion who regularly visits the territory when the other males are away. 'This is dangerous behaviour,' says Reynolds. 'As male lions do not tolerate intruders and will kill the offspring of others if they find them. Despite being hidden in some thickets by the riverbed where Madomo was born herself, the cubs are in a danger, being within the Marsh Pride's home range and around 3km from where the pride currently is. Survival of the fittest: Hungry lionesses crowd their latest catch in the grasslands of Maasai Mara, in Kenya . The world's lion population has reduced by approximately 30 per cent in the past two decades. Lions are now listed as 'vulnerable' on the IUCN red list, the most comprehensive evaluation of the conservation status of plant and animal species. It describes the main threats to lions as: . Indiscriminate killing (primarily as a result of retaliatory or pre-emptive killing to protect life and livestock) Prey base depletion . Habitat loss and conversion . Trophy hunting . Source: iucnredlist.org . Reynolds says: 'If Siena or any of the Marsh Pride males find them they will surely kill the cubs and chase Madomo away once more. 'Her cubs also face a threat from Martial Eagles who hunt in the area and buffalo who do not take kindly to lions and their cubs.' 'So far she has shown herself to be a good mother but the cubs lives hang in a precarious balance, as ever the drama of the Marsh Pride of lions on the plains of the Masai Mara continues to unfold.' Rose Hipwood, the Managing Director of The Luxury Safari Company, says: 'At the moment it is elephants and rhino which are receiving a lot of publicity, but the big cats are also under threat - this is why stories of new cubs are always rejoiced in from all corners of Africa, and it is testament to the preservation of the Mara ecosystem that big cats thrive there'.","Big cats are in fast decline thanks to hunting and a loss of their habitat .

"Michael Sam, the first openly gay player to be drafted into the NFL, has become engaged to his boyfriend and college sweetheart Vito Cammisano during a romantic trip to Europe, according to reports. The couple - who met as students at the University of Missouri, where they were both standout athletes - traveled to Spain for New Years before traveling on to Italy, where the proposal appears to have occurred. TMZ are reporting that a friend of 23-year-old Cammisano announced the pair's engagement on Twitter, congratulating the two on their decision to be married, and that Sam liked the post. The announcement coincided with Sam's 25th birthday and, according to his social media, he spent the day with Cammisano in Rome. Here come the grooms: Michael Sam - who celebrated his 25th birthday in Rome this week - is reportedly engaged to his longtime love, Vito Cammisano. The pair shared this picture from Italy on Instagram . Confirmation?: A friend of Cammisano's posted this message to her Instagram congratulating the two, which Sam clicked as a 'like' At Christmas, Sam also posted a photo to his Instagram of a ring, where he thanked his boyfriend for 'a great Christmas gift' They had to comment on the reported engagement. The couple met when Sam was a freshman at Mizzou, during one of his first college parties. It was a lingerie party and Cammisano was dressed as a rabbit, complete with a tail, which Sam told Out magazine he remembered because Cammisano - a star swimmer from 2009 to 2012 - was drunkenly vomiting over a railing from a second-story deck. 'I went up to him to ask if he was OK, and he started cursing at me, screaming, ''F--- off — do you know who I am?'' ' Sam told the mag. 'I told him I didn't care who he was. We didn't speak again for two years.' Vacation: Sam, the first openly gay player to be drafted into the NFL, is reportedly set to marry his college sweetheart, Vito Cammisano. The two are currently in Rome together . Wrong finger: At Christmas Sam posted a photo of a ring his boyfriend had given him, which he appears to be wearing on his right hand in this shot . Nice ring: Sam posted this photo to Instagram at Chrismas, thanking Cammisano for the amazing gift . When Cammisano came out to his swim team in 2011, they started dating, however it was secret, because Sam was closeted. 'Early on, it was awesome,' Sam said during a recent documentary on his life produced by the OWN network. 'And then bad things started to happen.' 'When Vito came to my house, he had to sneak through in and out of the window. 'Vito was getting really tired of that.' The pair broke up for a few months, until the holidays, when Cammisano realized Sam didn't have anywhere for Christmas. 'So Mickey came to Kansas City for Christmas and that's when (we realized) we missed this,' Cammisano said in the doco. 'It really was Christmas that brought us back together.' Controversial: Many viewers erupted in anger after a televised kiss was shown on ESPN in May as Sam was drafted by the St. Louis Rams . The pair have been together since, but were not captured in public together until earlier this year. They hit international headlines in May, when Sam - who  had come out in February - made history as the first openly gay NFL draft pick. The moment he was told he had been drafted by the St. Louis Rams was televised live on ESPN, and an emotional Sam kissed Cammisano in celebration. The unprecedented moment was met with reactions of joy by most but dismay, anger and even hate by others. Some online postings deplored the kiss as inappropriate for family viewing. Sam and Cammisano shared another public kiss last month when Sam accepted a GQ Man of the Year award. Sealed with a kiss: NFL player Michael Sam kisses his boyfriend Vito Cammisano after being named GQ Man of the Year 2014 in West Hollywood last month . Happy couple: Sam was nominated for the award along with Chris Pratt, Steve Carell, Dave Chappelle, Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley and featured on a joint cover of GQ magazine in December . Sam recently told Oprah Winfrey that while the aftermath of the moment was surprising, he would do it again. 'Absolutely. I came out so I wouldn't have to hide myself,' he said in the interview. 'That was me. What you saw was me. It wasn't staged. I was very emotional. 'And when I got that phone call it was one of the happiest moments of my life. 'It was three long days, coming close to the end of that, almost not being drafted. 'I wanted to share a moment with the one who had spent the same three days, I wanted to share a moment with him. 'I'm not a pretender anymore.' Sam was cut from the St. Louis Rams and then, in October, was dropped by the Dallas Cowboys. 'While this is disappointing, I will take the lessons I learned here in Dallas and continue to fight for an opportunity to prove that I can play every Sunday,' he wrote on Twitter at the time.","Mutual friend sent engagement rumors flying by posting a congratulations message on Instagram, which Sam 'liked'

"Earlier this week astronomers made the groundbreaking announcement that they had found eight new habitable planets using the Kepler space telescope - bringing its total up to 1,000. But will we ever have a chance to glimpse these planets in greater detail, either by telescope or perhaps by visiting them in the future? According to one of Nasa's top planet hunters, we will find a planet with oceans like Earth in the next 15 years - but visiting one would require us to overcome Einstein's law of special relativity. Dr Mather from Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland explained how the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope could find planets with oceans on them (illustrated). The giant tennis court-sized telescope will be used to scour the universe. His full interview appears in issue 34 of All About Space magazine . Dr John Mather is an astrophysicist at the Nasa Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, and the senior project scientist on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The giant telescope will be used to find the first bright objects that formed in the universe, figure out how galaxies evolved and find out how stars formed. But perhaps most excitingly, it will study Earth-like worlds beyond our solar system. ‘We hope to find a planet that’s Earth-like and measure its atmosphere to work out if it has enough water on it to make an ocean,’ he said in an interview with All About Space Magazine. Dr Mather's interview appears in the latest edition of All About Space magazine, issue 34 (shown), which is on sale now . ‘I think that will be in around ten to 15 years from now. ‘In that time we might be able to say: “I can see that star over there. [Its planet] has a climate that’s like Earth and it might have life on it.”’ While observing distant worlds is all well and good, actually visiting one at some point in the future poses somewhat of a challenge. And it’s something that Dr Mather thinks might be too much for us even with the help of artificial intelligence. To have any hope, one thing that will be important will be ‘defeating Einstein’ - namely, finding a way to overcome the limitations of light speed and space-time - or enlisting the help of robots. According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, nothing can travel faster than light - making interstellar travel all but impossible for humans. ‘We’re very fragile,’ said Dr Mather. ‘We’re not going to be able to travel in person very far without a lot of help. ‘I think robots are coming along very quickly. I believe robotic intelligence will come and we’ll have to decide whether we like them or not. ‘If they’re smart enough, then they can tell us what to do and where to go just as they did in the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. ‘However, I think it’s also possible that we’re going to defeat Einstein and that it will still be too far for us to go to another solar system. ‘It’s not impossible but it’s pretty hard. That’s what I think.’ The giant JWST will be used to find the first bright objects that formed in the universe, figure out how galaxies evolved and find out how stars formed (left). Dr Mather (right) also said that in ten to 15 years 'we hope to find a planet that’s Earth-like and measure its atmosphere' to see if it has oceans on it . The JWST is the successor to Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope and will launch in 2018. It is the size of a tennis court and will be launched in a compact form before unfolding in space. Shown here is a full-scale mock-up of what it will look like when it unfolds . The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be a large infrared telescope with a 6.5-meter (21ft) primary mirror. It is named after astronomer James Webb, who was the effective administrator for Nasa from 1961 through to 1968. He is widely heralded with persuading President Kennedy to fund the Apollo missions to the moon. The project is working to a 2018 launch date. It is a collaboration between Nasa, Esa and the Canadian space agency. The JWST will be the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide. It will study every phase in the history of our universe, ranging from the first luminous glows after the Big Bang, to the formation of solar systems capable of supporting life on planets like Earth, to the evolution of our own solar system. But while travel to one of these distant worlds might be somewhat of an impossibility for now, Dr Mather is optimistic when it comes to the chances of finding life elsewhere. ‘How life came to evolve on our planet is strong evidence that life can evolve elsewhere in the universe,’ he said. ‘Intelligent life - that’s us - has only really turned up quite recently. We ourselves are made out of star material. ‘Stars that explode send chemical material into space. Some of it is recycled and some of it travels outside of our galaxy to make the next generation of stars that could have planets - worlds that could be like Earth. ‘So that’s the idea: stars explode and make future generations of stars and planets.’ Finding out if we are not alone in the universe - or at least detecting tantalising hints that we are not - will be one of the primary goals of the JWST. It will also be used to scour the universe, just like the Hubble Space Telescope, and with the ability to take images in visible light it will no doubt return fascinating vistas back to Earth. Each of the 18 hexagonal-shaped mirror segments on the JWST (shown) is 4.3ft (1.32m) in diameter. The giant telescope will be the powerful space telescope ever launched. It will be in an orbit about 930,000 miles (1.5 million kilometres) from Earth to get the best views of the universe . Earlier this week astronomers revealed eight new planets had been discovered in the 'Goldilocks' zone of their stars, orbiting at a distance where oceans and life could exist. The discovery doubles the number of small planets less than twice the diameter of Earth which are believed to be in the habitable zone of their parent stars. Among these eight, astronomers say there are two that are the most similar to Earth of any known exoplanets to date. The two most Earth-like planets, known as Kepler-438b and Kepler-442b, both orbit red dwarf stars that are smaller and cooler than the sun. They have a 70 per cent and 60 per cent chance of being rocky, respectively. Its design, though, is radically different from that of Hubble. The JWST ‘doesn’t look like a standard telescope in a tube,’ Dr Mather explained. Instead, it will be a vast array of 18 hexagonal gold mirrors stitched together, which unfold after launch, to afford it our best ever view of the universe. Together with its vast sunshield, which prevents light from the sun ruining its optics, it is about the size of a tennis court. Thousands of astronomers will use data from the telescope after it launches in 2018 atop an Ariane V rocket. 'We’re doing this for the whole of humanity and 10,000 future users of the telescope,' explained Dr Mather. And many of those will be waiting with bated breath to find out if it can reveal fascinating new insights about potentially Earth-like worlds in other planetary systems.","Dr Mather from Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland said the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope could find habitable planets .

"At first glace, the 'Fahz' looks like an abstract work of art. But a closer look at this 3D printed vase reveals hidden faces in its outline, or 'negative space'. The vase was the brainchild of Nick Desbians, a designer from New York, who was asked to create an unusual gift for his wife on Mother’s Day. Scroll down for video . 'Rather than giving Martha a vase, I ended up designing a ""generative vase creation algorithm"",' he told MailOnline. 'I know, I also could have just gotten a card. But I've continued to play around with the program over the last few months and eventually we kind of wanted to take it out for a test drive.' When his wife, Martha, received the gift, she noticed that by gazing into the negative space she could see the faces of her children herself, and her husband. The profiles of Mrs Desbians' children appear on opposite sides of the negative space as the vase - or 'Fahz' -rotates, and these slowly transform into the profiles of Mr and Mrs Desbians. The ‘Fahz’ vases were created using photos of Mr Desbian's family. The concept came about when Nick Desbians, a designer from New York, was asked to create an unusual gift for his wife on Mother’s Day. Pictured is the outline of Nick Desbians (right) and his wife, Martha (left) He then isolated their outlines and used software to find out something known as ‘vector geometry’ which brought the profiles to life in negative space. In art, negative space is the area around and between the subject of an image. It becomes evident when the space around a subject, rather than the subject itself, reveals a hidden shape. Artists, such as Tang Yau Hoong, use negative space to draw attention to make conceptual and surreal paintings. Perhaps the most famous example is a vase, but other notable example include the key that shows the image of a skyline and the lady that appears in the shadow of a saxophone player. ‘Most images taken from the side will work, although higher contrast images produce more predictable results,’ said Mr Desbians in his Kickstarter site. ‘The outlines from the photos become the scaffolding for a 3D model that merges the distinct profiles into a seamless sculptural form.’ Under the banner Desbiens Design Research, the inventor now wants to use the funds from his Kickstarter campaign to buy a 3D printer to produce more Fahz’. 'The first step is to get our hands on that 3d printer,' he said. 'Then the real fun can begin. 'Martha and my background designing high quality bespoke spaces for real people makes us extremely curious about the potential of new technologies to create a new type of bespoke design. 'The idea can start with a vase, but the potential is much greater.'

"Firefighters in upstate New York were unsuccessful in their efforts to rescue a dog that got stranded on the ice of the Mohawk River near Schenectady. Fire officials in the town of Glenville said the 7-year-old Husky was about 200 yards from shore when rescue crews arrived on the scene around 3.30pm Wednesday. The owner, who has not been named, said his pet pooch broke free while being walked and ran onto the ice floes 'of his own accord.' Failed attempt: Firefighters in upstate New York were unsuccessful in their efforts to rescue a 7-year-old Husky that got stranded on the ice of the Mohawk River near Schenectady . Firefighters used an ice rescue team and an air boat to try and save the dog standing on an ice floe 200 yards from shore . An ice rescue team tried to reach the dog but the ice broke up and the current proved too risky, reported the Daily Gazette. A fire department airboat crew was launched, but rescue crews lost sight of the dog as it got dark. Officials say the ice jam the dog had been on broke up and was swept downriver. Emergency crews responded to the Mohawk River near Maalwyck Park in Glenville after getting a call about a stranded dog Wednesday afternoon. The Husky was barely visible amid ice floes as darkness fell on the river and temperatures plummeted to low teens. The owner of the runaway dog was on hand calling for his four-legged friend by name to try and make him come ashore, but to no avail. After about two hours, rescuers lost sight of the dog when the ice floe he was on broke up and was swept downstream . The owner of the runaway dog was on hand calling for his four-legged friend by name to try and make him come ashore . Beukendaal Fire Chief Paul Chevalier told Time Warner Cable News since this is the first freeze of the river, the ice was thin; as soon as it started to crack, they had to take the rescue team out and launched an airboat at around 5pm. By that point, however, they lost sight of the dog because the ice jam he was on had broken up and was swept by the current. The rescue operation was officially called off at 5.30pm, about two hours after the dog ran away. Chevalier said they put in as much effort into trying to locate the dog and bring it to safety as if they were dealing with a person.","7-year-old Husky got stranded on Mohawk River near Schenectady after breaking free from his owner on a walk .

"GOP leader John Boehner pushed back on Thursday against complaints from the right that he's not conservative enough, pointing out to reporters that when he was still a voting member of the House, he was ranked the eighth most conservative representative. 'It does pain me to be described as spineless or a squish,' Boehner said. 'I'll tell you what pains me the most is when they describe me as the establishment,' he added. 'I'm the most anti-establishment speaker the House has ever had.' At the news conference the House Speaker also blasted the White House for issuing a pair of veto threats on the very first day of the new Congress just as lawmakers were returning to Washington. Scroll down for video . I am not a 'squish': House Speaker John Boehner defended himself against attacks from the right today, telling reporters that it 'pains him' to be called 'establishment' 'At a minimum he could have waited a few hours. Maybe he could have waited a few days, ' the Ohio congressman said, referring to President Barack Obama. 'We were taking our oath of office, and they were issuing veto threats. Come on!' On Tuesday the White House said Obama would not sign legislation approving the Keystone XL pipeline nor would Obama put his seal of approval on a measure to raise the minimum number of hours that workers must be on the clock from 30 to 40 in order to qualify for health insurance from their employers. Both bills are expected to receive approval from the legislative branch but its unclear if they would receive enough votes in the Senate to nullify a veto. Boehner said today that the bills provided Obama with the opportunity to begin his last two years in office by signing into law measures that would advance the economy. 'Unfortunately the president's been taking steps towards more confrontation rather than bipartisan cooperation on jobs,' he said. 'Given the chance to start with a burst of bipartisan productivity, the president turned his back on the American peoples' priorities.' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also opened fire on Obama on Thursday over his plan to stall construction on Keystone. 'Let’s keep the voters in mind who sent us here, and let’s remember what they told us in November. One of the things they told us is that they’d like to see more teamwork across the aisle,' McConnell said on the Senate floor. 'So for a president who has said he’d like to see more bipartisan cooperation, this is a perfect opportunity, he continued, calling on the the president to work with the Senate 'to end the gridlock and get this job-creating infrastructure project moving.' House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio gives House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi a smooch after being re-elected to a third term during the opening session of the 114th Congress. Boehner narrowly avoided a coup from his own party, forcing what he calls a 'family conversation' among the GOP . Boehner said today that he understands why the American people are 'frustrated' with Washington, as well his own leadership, and that they 'want action.' 'This frustration that's out there, they need to take it out on somebody. Take it out on the president, take it out on me...it comes with the territory,' he said, brushing off attacks from supporters of his own political party. But Boehner pooh pooh'd accusations that he's part of the problem. The House speaker pointed out that he he supported the earmark ban and brought the lower chamber back to regular order. He said he's also allowed more members from both sides of the aisle to participate in the political process than any other speaker. 'I'm pretty conformable in my own skin, and I'm gonna do my best to show all our members, Democrats and Republicans, and those members who voted against me, that I'm up to the job that I was given,' he said. Boehner narrowly survived a challenge to the gavel on Tuesday after 25 conservative members of his caucus revolted. In the end he was reelected to his leadership position with 216 votes, staving off a second ballot situation, but the fallout from the intra-party fight has continued. Two Republicans who voted against Boehner were removed from their positions on the House Rules Committee that the speaker controls. Allies of the speaker what him to exact retribution on more of the dissenters in order to ward off future ambushes and ban them from chairing subcommittees in the House. Other representatives think such actions would be too heavy-handed, however, and Boehner promised before the vote that he would not retaliate against Republicans who voted against him. Boehner told reporters on Wednesday that the GOP would work out its issues during a 'family conversation.' Today he said he still hadn't decided how to proceed in the matter. 'My focus is on the American people's priorities,' he asserted. 'This family conversation will continue and will come to some resolution in the days and week ahead.'","'I'll tell you what pains me the most is when they describe me as the establishment,' the GOP leader said.

"It has long been a mystery why agile birds cannot out-manoeuvre huge jetliners, causing aircraft to make emergency landings in extreme circumstances. But now scientists have worked out why, and it appears that birds don’t take into account an aircraft's speed, when calculating how to avoid it. This failing means that birds have little time to escape vehicles such as aircraft and speeding cars, which travel faster than 75 mph (120 kph). Scientists believe that birds don't take into account an aircraft's speed, when calculating how to avoid it, instead solely relying on how far away the aircraft is from them at a certain time (stock image). This results in the deaths of thousands of birds every year and potential aircraft disasters . According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 9,000 birds are struck by aircraft over the US every year and the estimate is conservative, because bird strikes don’t have to be reported. Bird strikes not only usually kill the animals, but can injure drivers if they hit a vehicle’s windscreen, as well as posing a potentially serious threat to flight safety, because they can cause engine failure. To work out why the strikes happen, a team of scientists from the US Department of Agriculture's National Wildlife Research Centre in Ohio, Indiana State University and Purdue University, also in Indiana, used virtual reality, to avoid injuring birds. Researchers found that the birds they studied left it too late to escape vehicles travelling faster than 75 mph (120kph). Essentially, they judged a safe distance to manuoeure without calculating that the vehicles might approach them at speed, as shown in this diagram . The FAA estimates that bird strikes have resulted in 200 worldwide deaths since 1988. They are dangerous to aircraft because birds can be sucked into a jet engine and strike an engine fan blade. That impact knocks out a single blade and can trigger a domino effect, resulting in engine failure. Incidents are most common shortly before landing or take-off when the jet engines are at top speed. A 12 lb (five kg) goose striking an aircraft going 150 mph (241 kph) at lift-off generates the force of a 1,000 lb (454 kg)weight dropped from a height of 10 feet (three metres), according to Bird Strike Committee USA. Despite this, the number of accidents involving civil aircraft is low, estimated at one fatal accident in one billion flying hours. Around 65 per cent of bird strikes cause little damage to aircraft, but the blow is usually fatal to the bird. It's been estimated that bird strikes cause $400 million (£265 million) of damage every year in the US and up to $1.2 billion damage to commercial aircraft globally. The first reported bird strike was by Orville Wright in 1905. In 2005, the Space Shuttle Discovery hit a vulture during its launch, with no damage. On January 15, 2009, a US Airways flight ditched into the Hudson River after experiencing a loss of both turbines. The suspected cause of engine failure was a collision with a flock of geese shortly after take-off. The experiment took place in an enclosed chamber where brown-headed cowbirds were played videos of lorries rushing towards them at speeds ranging from 37 to 224 mph (60 to 360 kph), which is the cruising speed of some small airplanes and falls within the take-off speed for commercial aircraft. By measuring their reactions, the scientists discovered that the birds seemed to react based on the distance between their bodies and the lorry, ignoring how fast the vehicle was travelling. The birds repeatedly started to fly away from the vehicle when it was 98 ft (30 metres) away, according to the study, published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. The study says: ‘Alert and flight initiation distances remained similar across vehicle speeds, and accordingly, alert and flight initiation times decreased at higher vehicle speeds. ‘Thus, avoidance behaviours in cowbirds appeared to be based on distance rather than time available for escape, particularly at 60–150 km.’ While the strategy worked for avoiding slower moving objects, the researchers observed that it failed when trying to escape vehicles travelling faster than 75mph (120kph), such as cars, lorries and airplanes. They were unable to pinpoint exactly how the birds reacted to speeds above 112 mph (180kph) – cruising speeds typical of a small aircraft, or commercial aircraft at take-off. The scientists concluded: ‘As vehicle speed increased, cowbirds did not have enough time to assess the approaching vehicle. ‘Although potentially effective for evading predators, the decision-making process used by cowbirds in our study appears maladaptive in the context of avoiding fast-moving vehicles.’ They said that further research is needed to check that different species of birds use the same avoidance techniques and suggested that installing lights on aircraft could help avians dodge death from a longer distance away.

"A newly released video shows the moment Cleveland police officers tackled and restrained Tamir Rice's 14-year-old sister after their colleague shot dead the 12-year-old boy. The grainy surveillance video made public by the City of Cleveland shows the officers struggling with the teen before shoving her into the back seat of a patrol car parked next to the where Rice lay on the snowy ground bleeding. Northeast Ohio Media Group is reporting that it obtained the nearly 30-minute-long footage from the city after officials initially refused to release it. Other media outlets were given the video Thursday. Scroll down for videos . A newly released video shows the moment Cleveland police officers tackled and restrained Tamir Rice's 14-year-old sister just moments after the 12-year-old was shot . The footage shows the officers struggling with the teen just steps away from the spot where her young brother lay bleeding on the snow . Roughed up: The teenager is pushed to the ground by the partner of her brother's killer and another officer . Putting up a fight: The sister tries to rise several times, but the officers repeatedly push her down . Patrol officer Timothy Loehmann shot Tamir in the abdomen within two seconds of a patrol car stopping near the boy November 22. He died the next day. Tamir's family gave the city permission to release another version of the video days after the shooting. That shorter video shows Tamir in a park near a recreation center carrying what turned out to be an airsoft gun that shoots non-lethal plastic pellets. The video ends with Loehmann shooting Tamir. Loehmann, a rookie cop with a checkered employment history, and his training officer and the driver of the patrol car, Frank Garmback, had responded to a report about a man with a gun on November 22. Not going quietly: Tamir's sibling writhes while being led to the squad car after having her hands restrained . Strong words: The Rice family's attorney described the treatment of the 14-year-old at the hands of the officers 'the cruelest thing I've ever seen on video' A police union official has said the officers thought the gun was real and that they didn't know Tamir, who was 5 feet 7 and weighed 195lbs, was so young. The new video begins with the shooting of Tamir. About 90 seconds later, Tamir's sister, whose name has not been released, runs toward her fallen brother and Garmback immediately pushes her to the ground. Garmback and another officer are then shown handcuffing the struggling teen and finally placing her in the back seat of Loehmann and Garmback's patrol car. Walter Madison, an attorney for the family, called the treatment of the 14-year-old sister, who he would not name, 'the cruelest thing I've ever seen on video.'

"Owner Pam Dillion, 55, claims that her cat Tuppence is the world's oldest moggy . A Briton claims she owns the world's oldest cat - a 27-year-old one-eyed moggy who has been run over an incredible 25 times. Pam Dillon, 55, says her pet Tuppence was born in 1987 and beats the current official World Record Holder Tiffany Two, who lives in the USA, by one year. Tuppence has used all of her nine lives and then some, and experts say in human terms she would be around 125-years-old. She only has half a tail after one of her many road accidents that saw her lose 25 lives - including one last year when she broke her back legs. Tuppence also lost a further life and an eye after a coming together with a dog two years ago. In total it is estimated that the moggy has used up 26 lives. But Ms Dillon, of Plymouth, Devon, said despite her cat's battered body, she is still going strong. 'There is no secret remedy for a long life,' she said. 'We had another cat in the family who lived to 22. 'I give her oil and garlic tablets but really Tuppence is just lucky to be alive.' Infact Tuppence has used up 26 lives after she has been run over 25 times and then attacked . The oldest cat living is Tiffany Two - born 13 March 1988 - aged 26 years 204 days as of 3 October 2014. Tiffany Two lives with her owner, Sharron Voorhees in San Diego, California, USA. Ms Dillon, who lives on her own, only took ownership of Tuppence when her father Raymond died aged 82 in February last year. He was given her as a young kitten after her brother Clive, found her while working at the Devonport dockyard in 1987. One-eyed Tuppence has used up all of her nine lives and has survived being run over an incredible 25 times . 'Tuppence was just a kitten,' she said. 'She was a dockyard moggy and when she turned up she was shabby and mucky as she had been out in the rain. 'None of us expected he would still be here 27 years later. I am amazed to discover she might be the oldest in the world. It is lovely. Tuppence also only has half a tail after one of her many road accidents - including one last year when she broke her back legs . 'She is just brilliant - she sleeps a lot now and can't run, so I keep her away from the road. She has been run over 25 times - and I don't think she would survive another accident.' Tuppence celebrated her 27th birthday on December 21 last year with a small party and a few extra treats. Ms Dillon said: 'She has been through the wars. She has half a tail and one eye and is looking a bit rough. Her owner is confident that Tuppence will make her 28th Birthday in December this year . 'We nearly lost her recently in the vets but she suddenly started perking up again. She is still lively - and we think she will make it to her 28th birthday. 'It is brilliant she is still here. She just sits around, eats and occasionally goes out to the garden. She walks with a wobble and is not as agile as she once was. Tuppence is very protective of Pam's other cat, Tigger, who is 22-years of age . 'Even though I only got her when my father died, she has always been part of the family and I love her. 'I also have two German Shepherds who she loves and is very protective of and another cat Tigger, who is 22.' In June this year Poppy the tortoiseshell, who was born in February 1990, the same month as Nelson Mandela was released from prison, from Bournemouth, Dorset, died at the age of 24. She lived through five British Prime Ministers and was officially recognised by Guinness World Records on May 19 2014. The oldest cat in history was a feline called Creme Puff who was born on 3 August 1967 and lived until 6 August 2005 - an amazing 38 years and 3 days. Creme Puff lived with her owner, Jake Perry, in Austin, Texas, USA. Other cats who have made a claim to the record over the past few years, include Mischief from St Austell, Cornwall, who celebrated his 27th birthday, Lucy from Llanelli, South Wales, whose owner's said she was 39-years-old, and Olive from Partington, Greater Manchester, who was 24-years-old.","It has been claimed that former dock yard cat,Tuppence, was born in 1987 .

"An elderly couple were attacked in their home by a pair of machete-wielding thugs while they watched television. The 70-year-old pensioner - who wished to remain anonymous - was punched repeatedly in the face and his wife, 69, was also threatened with the large blade. The raid took place in Birch Avenue, Chadderton, Oldham, on Tuesday evening while they were watching television at about 6.20pm. The elderly couple - who wish to remain anonymous - were attacked as they watched television on this road . When the pensioner opened the door to his house in Chadderton, he was punched repeatedly by the offender . When the couple heard the doorbell ring, the husband answered the door and was confronted by two men who forced their way in to the house. The pensioner tried to push the offenders out the door but was punched by one repeatedly in the face. He was left with a bloody lip and shoulder injury. Hearing the disturbance, his wife ran to his aid into the hallway of the £200,000 property. By this point, the offenders were half-way up the stairs and were seen holding a machete. The thugs demanded to know if the couple had a safe, and threatened them with a blade. The wife managed to run from the house, screaming for help and both offenders fled in panic, empty-handed. The first offender was described as black, about 6ft 2in tall, well-built and in his mid-20s. He had prominent eyebrows, a large nose, and was wearing a dark grey woollen hat with a black scarf around his face. The thugs demanded to know if the couple had a safe, and threatened them with a blade at their house . His accomplice was also black, about 5ft 8in tall, in his mid-20s with a slim build. He was also wearing dark clothing and was carrying a stainless steel machete said to be about 18 inches long, three inches wide and with a slightly curved walnut handle. Police are now appealing to anyone with information to come forward. Det Con Kelly Bragg said: 'The motive for this appalling attempted robbery is unclear. We cannot be certain if it was a case of mistaken identity or for whatever reason the offenders have deliberately targeted this address. 'What is for certain is that an elderly couple have been left extremely traumatised after the sanctity of their home was invaded and they were violently assaulted. For those reasons it is imperative we locate the offenders as soon as possible. 'I would therefore urge anyone who has information about this incident, or perhaps know who may be responsible, to call us and help us put these dangerous offenders behind bars.'

"Ready? Set? Go crazy. Most Americans' 2014 tax returns are due in 14 weeks, and the Internal Revenue Service is trying to cope with reams of new Obamacare regulations with a lengthy instruction manual that's likely to send countless taxpayers sprinting toward accountants and other tax preparers. The manual, called 'Publication 5187 – Health Care Law: What’s New for Individuals & Families,' is 21 pages long and written with all the compassion of a mediaeval dentist. Its central instruction, though, is simple: Either prove you have medical insurance that satisfies the Affordable Care Act, or prove you have an exemption. Otherwise, calculate how much extra you owe in taxes. SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE MANUAL, IF YOU DARE . IRS Publication 5187 is 21 pages long and written with all the compassion of a mediaeval dentist . HE'S GOT A PLAN: President Obama pledged to lower the cost of health insurance but the end result of Obamacare may be a boom year for professional tax preparers . POP QUIZ: Can you decipher these examples from the IRS? They're included in the tax agency's latest effort to make Obamacare penalties easier to document . The examples the IRS provides are about as digestible as the thousands of pages that make up the law itself, or the tens of thousands of pages of regulations it has spawned. And they require the use of a four-page glossary of terms, definitions and acronyms just to understand it all. Forget the obvious ones like Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and Federal Poverty Line (FPL). This year Americans need to know about Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC) and Exemption Certificate Numbers (ECNs). There's also the SLCSP, which stands for the 'second lowest cost silver plan.' That's the benchmark insurance plan available in each ZIP code that the government uses to calculate the maximum allowable tax credit anyone can claim for paying their premiums. The 'National Average Bronze Plan Premium' (NABPP) is another critical number. That figure, the IRS says, 'is used in calculating the shared responsibility payment (SRP).' It helps to know what the shared responsibility payment is, too. That's the new tax. And then comes the switcheroo: 'A table of NABPP amounts can be found in the Instructions for Form 8965, Health Coverage Exemptions, and in Publication 4012, ACA tab.' This is where tax filers reach for a bottle – either Tums or bourbon. Reprinted from Publication 5187 – Can you understand it? How is the premium tax credit claimed on the tax return? Only taxpayers who purchased qualified health plans from the Marketplace may be eligible for the premium tax credit. Eligible taxpayers claim the premium tax credit on their federal income tax return. Taxpayers who received the benefit of advance credit payments must file a federal income tax return even if they otherwise are not required to file. On Form 8962, Premium Tax Credit, a taxpayer must subtract the advance credit payments for the year from the amount of the taxpayer’s premium tax credit calculated on the tax return. If the premium tax credit computed on the return is more than the advance credit payments made on the taxpayer’s behalf during the year, the difference will increase the refund or lower the amount of tax owed. This will be reported in the Payments section of Form 1040. If the advance credit payments are more than the premium tax credit (an excess advance credit payment), the difference will increase the amount owed and result in either a smaller refund or a balance due. This will be entered in the Tax and Credits section of the return. There may be a limitation on the amount of tax liability a taxpayer owes as a result of an excess advance credit payment. The limitation is based on the taxpayer’s household income. For taxpayers with household income below 400 percent of the FPL, the amount of tax liability due to excess advance credit payments is limited as provided in the repayment limitation table. ON YOUR MARK ... GET SET ... CRY! New IRS forms will meet broken pencils and green eyeshades this year, including a dense worksheet required of everyone who wants credit for paying their insurance premiums . 'Brandon Talbot is single, has no dependents and lives in Alabama,' one example begins. 'When he enrolled through the Marketplace, Brandon was approved for advance credit payments based on his projected 2014 household income of $39,095. The applicable figure for his household income is .095. Brandon enrolled in a qualified health plan. The applicable SLCSP is $5,200.' Understand so far? No? No matter. 'Brandon’s Form 1095-A shows advance credit payments of $1,486. Brandon’s actual modified AGI for 2014 was $46,000, which is more than the FPL limit shown in Publication 4012, ACA tab (more than 400% of the FPL for a family of 1).' You do have a copy of Publication 4012 handy, right? 'Since Brandon’s household income is above 400% of the FPL, he may not claim any premium tax credit, and must increase his tax liability by the amount of his advance credit payments.

"A shocked nine-year-old girl found a dead maggot in a packet of Asda noodles after she had started tucking into the snack, it has been claimed. Malika Carrington was said to have made the grim find in the supermarket's 25p noodles after they had been heated up in the microwave. It was not know whether the grub was alive or dead when the instant chicken flavoured treat, which had been bought two weeks earlier, was heated up. It was claimed that nine-year-old Malika Carrington found the dead maggot after heating up a packet of Asda's instant noodles . 'I couldn't believe it when Malika showed me,' said her mother Keisha Carrington, 28, from Longsight, Manchester. 'She didn't realise what it was initially but I could see it was as maggot straight away. 'I was fuming. All I could think was how on earth did it get in there? It was so disgusting. Thank goodness she didn't eat it.' After complaining, the supermarket offered to reimburse Ms Carrington 50p for the incident - 25p for the faulty packet plus an extra 25p for goodwill. Malika, nine, pictured with her mother, Keisha, who branded the alleged find 'disgusting' Keisha Carrington says her daughter has been put off noodles for life after making the discovery . The mum-of-two added: 'Normally my kids love noodles for a quick snack. But finding a dead maggot in her bowl was enough to put my daughter off noodles for life. 'I complained to Asda and they have asked me to take the packet and maggot back to the store so they can see what happened. 'And then they said they would give me the money back for the packet of noodles plus an extra free. 'I'm sorry but I just don't think that's good enough. It's not like the good was faulty. It was not known whether the maggot was dead or alive when it was heated up in the microwave . 'It was an actual maggot. We don't know whether it was alive or dead because by the time we realised what it was, it had been in the microwave for eight minutes. 'I just hope they found out where it came from so it doesn't happen to someone else.' Asda have asked Ms Carrington to return the offending maggot and noodles so they can investigate. An Asda spokesman said: 'We're very sorry for what's happened and have been in touch with Ms Carrington to ask her to return the product to store in order for us to carry out a full investigation.'","Malika Carrington, 9, claims to have found a dead maggot in her noodles .

"With their stubborn tempers and massive jaws, rottweilers haven't always had the best reputation. But these dogs laid that ghost to rest by saving a shivering trapped pensioner - who they licked placidly until a human came to raise the alarm. The 80-year-old woman had been stuck in a field for 15 hours following a fall, and would have remained there all night had Tillie, Billy, Gerrard and May not found her during a 1am walk. Gentle giants: Tillie, five, Billy, eight, Gerrard, six, and May, three, rescued an 80-year-old  who was trapped in a bush in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. Also pictured (far right) is the rottweiler owned by Lana Martenovic . Owner David Malt said the incident unfolded when his pets, aged eight, six, five and three, scampered off during the late-night walk next to Bournside School in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. He followed the rottweiliers as they made a beeline for a bush in the school playing field - where he only walks the dogs when the field is deserted because of their fearsome reputation. When he and his nephew Jack caught up with the pets, the pair discovered them sitting with an 80-year-old woman and licking her gently. She was conscious and told Mr Malt she had been trapped in the bush since 10am the previous day after losing her footing. He immediately called an ambulance following the incident, which happened in the early hours of January 3, and she was taken to hospital suffering from exposure. Jack's mother Lana Martenovic, who also owns a rottweiler from the same family, credits the gentle giants with saving the woman's life. Quiet: The woman had been walking in the grounds of Bournside School in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire . 'They bounded over the field when they were let off the lead,' she said. 'The female dog started licking her and refused to leave her side until my son and his uncle arrived. 'The woman had been stuck there in the bushes all day, since about 10am, but she didn't make a sound when the dogs found her. 'She told the boys later that she got off the bus at the wrong stop. 'If my son and brother in law hadn't have walked their dogs at that time, it might have been a very different outcome for the lady. I don't think she would have survived.' A spokesman for the South Western Ambulance Service said paramedics were called at 1.20am on January 3 to treat an 80-year-old woman who was suffering from exposure to the cold. She was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital for treatment. Used as guard dogs for centuries, rottweilers are known for their stubborn natures and strong jaws, which can refuse to let go of an object unless the dogs are taught the firm command 'drop it'. But owners say the breed is unfairly maligned, and have set up a society called The Rottweilier Club to rehabilitate its image. While club members admit the dogs can be 'strong, very demanding and somewhat arrogant', with a firm and sympathetic hand they can be loyal and gentle to almost anyone they encounter. Ms Martenovic said: 'Rottweilers don't have a great reputation because they are perceived as aggressive, but they're really protective, and originally bred as working dogs. 'So it is good to hear some positive news about them.' Were you the woman who was rescued or do you know her?

"Boob jobs remain the UK's favourite cosmetic procedure, with 11,00 women going under the knife every year. But as restaurant manager Laura Damiani, 31, found out, not every operation goes exactly as planned. Ms Damiani was left in agony following a botched boob job and things got worse 14 days later when necrosis - a type of gangrene - set in. Scroll down for video . Agony: Laura Damiani, 31, was left with necrotic nipples following a bungled breast operation . After weeks of unbearable pain, her nipples had to be removed - leaving her self-conscious and her relationship with her boyfriend at breaking point. 'The surgeon made me feel very comfortable,' says Ms Damiani who had hoped to have her differently sized breasts evened up. 'He said the outcome was going to be fantastic and I had no reason to think otherwise. You go into it a bit blind. 'You have this sort of rosy outlook that everything is going to be fine. You hear things occasionally but you never think it's going to be you or your family and friends. That's just the risk you take.' Initially everything seemed fine and Ms Damiani was told her breasts were healing normally. But suspecting something was wrong after the pain worsened, she insisted on a second opinion. 'I saw a second nurse and that's the first time I was advised that something was seriously wrong,' she says. Normal: At first her wounds appeared to be healing normally but they soon grew painful and infected . Infected: Gangrene had set into the wound and her nipples turned black . Necrosis, the most common form of which is gangrene, sets in when part of the body suffers trauma or lacks blood flow. Common causes include road accidents, bungled surgery and war wounds. Diabetes and blood vessel disease can also cause gangrene to set in. Symptoms include discoloured skin, usually blue, green or black, foul smelling discharge, numbness in the affected area, fever, confusion and persistent pain. As the name suggests, necrosis kills off tissue cells and in extreme cases, can leave body parts literally rotting away. Cases of gangrene or necrosis usually result in the amputation of the infected body part or, if it is caught early enough, an operation to remove the dead tissue. If left untreated or if the gangrene is particularly extensive, it can be deadly. In fact, things were more than seriously wrong - they were dangerously so. Ms Damiani had developed necrosis. Usually caused by severe trauma to cells, necrosis causes tissue cells to die and results in parts of the body quite literally rotting away. In Ms Damiani's case, it was her nipples that had succumbed and before long, she found herself back in hospital. 'I'd never heard of necrosis before,' she says. 'I was very scared.' Shockingly, the surgeon who bungled the operation proved less than sympathetic. 'He said: ""Oh this happens but it has not happened to me in a long time"",' remembers Ms Damiani. Despite the surgeon's ministrations, in the end he was forced to cut away all of the infected parts of Ms Damiani's breasts. 'Basically, what he did was remove the whole areola and nipple so I was left with just raw skin on my left breast,' she says. 'I realised that my breasts would never be the same again and I wasn't going to have the outcome I had hoped for.' Left with no nipples and uneven breasts, Ms Damiani became depressed and was left so self-conscious, she couldn't even bear to be touched by her boyfriend Wesley. 'I was in a really bad way,' she remembers. 'Everything seemed to be going really badly. I suffered from depression for a while. I still am. I'm still on antidepressants. 'I didn't want to do anything with Mum. I didn't want to go out. I didn't want to meet friends. Sex was non existent for about six months and it's still suffering now. 'A year and a half down the line, I still feel really ugly. We were literally on the verge of breaking up. It was really hard.' Healed: After three more operations and 18 months of suffering, Ms Damiani is finally back to normal . But despite her past experience and fear of going under the knife, Ms Damiani has finally taken action to fix her ruined breasts and has had another operation, this time with surgeon Paul Harris, to mend the damage. Two operations, one of them nipple reconstruction, later and she says she is finally learning to enjoy life again. 'Now I'm feeling absolutely fantastic,' she says. 'Already I've taken steps to feeling more confident about myself, to getting my life back on track. 'It's a huge relief not to feel bad about myself anymore and to feel self-conscious. I never thought I would get to this point. 'When I look in the mirror now, I see a completely different person. I see someone who's happy, who's confident in their skin and I'm not afraid to show myself anymore. 'Before I was always hiding and now I feel I can show myself again.'","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Richard Bristowe is facing jail after admitted to downloading thousands of images of boys being abused in the Philippines . A top flying instructor is facing jail after he admitted to downloading thousands of images of boys being abused in the Philippines. Richard Bristowe was caught after he made international money transfers to a criminal in Manila who runs a live streaming service on the internet. The 70-year-old is the director of Aviation South West, which runs a flying school at Exeter. Officers raided his Exeter home and his office at Exeter Airport in December 2012 and found 3,600 images or movies on his computers. These included 41 in the worst category, which shows sadism or bestiality, and 275 showing adults raping children, of which 49 were movies. He was also found with a memory stick in his pocket which contained the encryption key to many of the files which he had downloaded from the Philippines. Bristowe, from Exeter, has also run lessons from Plymouth Airport and is on the Civil Aviation Authority's heads of training group. He has continued to sit alongside councillors and airline representatives on the Exeter Airport Consultative Group during the two years since his home was raided by police. Bristowe has trained thousands of pilots and succeeded in keeping his secret life hidden until British police were tipped off about his Western Union payments to Manila. He admitted 12 counts of possessing indecent images of children at Exeter Crown Court. Judge Phillip Wassall adjourned his sentence until next month and ordered the probation service to prepare a probation report. The 70-year-old admitted 12 counts of possessing indecent images of children at Exeter Crown Court, pictured, and will be sentenced next month .

"An art thief brazenly walked into a New Orleans gallery on Tuesday, took a painting off the wall, and walked straight back out again. The suspect, who remains at large, entered Rodrigue Studio, located at 730 Royal Street in the French Quarter, at 3 p.m. and stole the 24x26 inch painting, 'Wendy and Me' by beloved New Orleans artist George Rodrigue. Brazen: The unidentified thief (top) who remains at large, took the painting 'Wendy and Me' off the wall of the gallery in New Orleans' French Quarter and walked out unchallenged . The whole incident was captured by the gallery's surveillance cameras, which clearly show the thief enter and exit the building in under a minute (video below). He is described as a white male with a full beard, 5'8' tall, weighing approximately 165lb and aged about 30 years old. Police say the suspect traveled down nearby Royal Street on foot towards Saint Ann Street but it is uncertain where he went from there. The suspect (pictured) is described by police as a white male with a full beard, 5'8' tall, weighing approximately 165lb and aged about 30 years old . The distinctive painting, valued at $250,000, features the blue dog for which Rodrigue's work is famous and was used on the artist's wedding invitations when he married his wife Wendy in 1997. It is therefore also of great sentimental value to the family. George Rodrigue passed away in December 2013 and the painting was on exhibit as part of a retrospective of his work. Wedding day: The stolen painting pictures the artist as his famous Blue Dog with his wife Wendy, who he married in 1997. The image was used on their wedding invitations and so has enormous sentimental value . In a happy turn of events, Nola.com has since reported that the painting was found undamaged by a local rock band, Stereo Fire Empire, near Royal Street just hours after it was taken. The band members had left the House of Blues when lead guitarist Evan Diez spotted two paintings leaning against a wall of the Omni Royal Hotel. Diez told Nola.com: 'I'd read the article [about the missing painting] and then had to explain it to everybody... Blue Dog paintings are as New Orleans as a pothole, like everybody knows it.' The second painting, titled 'Three Amigos' is believed to have been a print sold to a local non-profit organization through the George Rodrigue Foundation for the Arts. Local heroes: Evan Diez (third from left), guitarist of New Orleans rock band Stereo Fire Empire, spotted the painting on the street later the same day. He and his band mates handed it in to 8th District Police Station . Both paintings were handed in at the 8th District Police Station just a block away from where they were found. The band posted a video to Facebook that showed them handing in the stolen goods. The group have joked that they might write a song about what they have described as their 'Scooby-doo-like adventure'. They also said they saw a man that fitted the description of the suspect walking around the area earlier in the evening. Jacques Rodrigue, son of the artist, was overjoyed to have the special painting back in his family's possession. The Advocate reports that the theft on Tuesday is similar to an incident in 2010, when a man took two small 'Blue Dog' paintings off the gallery’s wall, put them in a bag and walked out. Those paintings were later found in the shed of a New Orleans home, but the thief was never found. More recently, two men were arrested after trying to sell a stolen Rodrigue painting valued at $50,000 on Craigslist. That painting had been stolen from a framer’s warehouse. The police will now use DNA fingerprinting techniques to try and identify the suspect in the latest theft.

"Signals from the black box of AirAsia Flight 8501 were detected Thursday near where the plane's partly submerged tail was located, but the signals were lost soon after. An Indonesian Armed Forces Commander said that a recovery of the tail, where the flight recorders are typically located, is in progress. The black box or flight data recorder could help determine the cause of the crash, however it only has 30 days of battery life. It comes as news that the families of the victims of AirAsia flight QZ8501 will be offered $US100,000 in compensation by the airline as those searching for the plane claim they are just hours away from finding the plane's black box. It follows an offer of $US24,000 after family members were given a draft letter from AirAsia, which detailed its initial compensation deal,CNN reported. Scroll down for video . Indonesian navy divers prepare to dive in an area where they found the tail of AirAsia QZ8501 in the Java sea . Signals from the black box of AirAsia Flight 8501 were detected Wednesday near where the plane's partly submerged tail was located, but the signals were lost soon after . Australian experts have flown into Indonesia to help identify the victims of the AirAsia QZ8501 flight . Several divers jumped into the sea where the plane is located on Thursday in a bid to locate the missing black box. Lieutenant. Edy Tirtayasa, commander of Indonesia's navy rescue team, told Channel News Asia they are planning to send two contingents to the plane. 'We are going to send down one observation team to take photos. Then two teams will do the recovery process -- to recover bodies if there are any,' he said. 'If not, they will recover the black box for investigation and then other debris from the aircraft,” There were 162 people on board the flight, so far only 40 bodies have been recovered with more expected to be found in the plane's fuselage which lies at the bottom of the sea, off the coast of the Indonesian island of Borneo. Of the 162 people on board, 155 were passengers while others were pilots and crew members. No survivors have been recovered since the search for the plane began 11 days ago. Family members have been left confused about the letter's wording and raising issue with the airline approaching families separately in relation to compensation, the Wall Street Journal reported. But Indonesia AirAsia's director of safety and security defended the isolated discussions to The Strait Times on Tuesday, saying: 'We respect that [some] families are still hoping to see that their relatives survived, so we offered [compensation first] to those whose family members have been identified'. So far 40 bodies have been recovered from the Java Sea. Families of victims have been offered compensation . They have been offered $US100,000 after they were initially offered $US24,000 by the airline . Captain Raden Achmad Sadikin added the airlines would be compensating families in line with Indonesian policy. According to the regulatory body that is responsible for Indonesia's finance sector, agencies that insure airlines were liable to give 1.25 billion rupiah for every one of the 155 passengers including 315 million rupiah to 750 million rupiah for the 25 passengers who bought flight insurance. This news comes as searchers are hopeful they will recover the plane's black box on Thursday after finding the aircraft's tail the day before. Bad weather conditions have hampered the search, which has prevented divers from confirming the object in the water is in fact the tail, according to the Singapore-based news website. It is thought the black box and voice recorders were inside the end of the plane. The search area for bodies and debris was expanded this week to allow for the strong currents that have been pushing debris around, Indonesian search and rescue operation coordinator Tatang Zainudin said. On Wednesday, searchers looking for the plane say they believe they have found the aircraft's tail . Along with the tail, the fuselage is thought to be with it, off the coast of the Indonesian island of Borneo . The black box is thought to be inside the tail. It will help shed some light on the last moments of the flight before it crashed . The water in the Java Sea is relatively shallow, about 30 meters deep, but this is the worst time of year for a recovery operation because of monsoon rains and wind that create choppy seas and blinding silt from river run-off. But in some ways, it is easier to find a missing plane compared to the extreme depths of the Indian Ocean, where searchers continue to hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared last March with 239 people aboard. 'Because the Java Sea is such an enclosed basin, and there's not really big currents passing through it, everything just stays there for quite a while and the waves make it so that the sediment doesn't slowly sink to the bottom,' Erik van Sebille, an oceanographer at Sydney's University of New South Wales, said. 'It continuously keeps churning it up.' Dr van Sebille said the conditions also make it particularly dangerous for divers because the water is dark and murky, making it easy for them to cut themselves on jagged wreckage or become snared and trapped. During the dry season, he added, it would likely be easy to see the plane underwater from the sky. Searchers remain hopeful the recovery of the tail would happen sometime on Thursday . Indonesina Sea and Coast Guards display recovered seats from the AirAsia flight QZ8501 on Tuesday . National Search and Rescue Agency personnel carry wrecked seats from the AirAsia plane to land . Indonesia Sea and Coast Guard carries remains of seats from the Royal Malaysian Navy KD Kasturi at Port of Kumai on January 6 . As the cause of the incident remains a mystery, the find would shed light on what happened during the final moments of the QZ8501 flight. But The Indonesian meteorological agency said weather was the 'triggering factor' of the crash in the Java Sea, with ice likely damaging the engines of the Airbus A320-200. Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs Indroyono Soesilo told reporters the black box would be analysed by experts in Indonesia when it was located. It will provide essential information about the plane along with final conversations between the captain and co-pilot. The ping-emitting beacons still have about 20 days before their batteries go dead, but high waves had prevented the deployment of ships that drag 'ping' locators. Sonar-equipped ships involved in the massive international hunt have identified what they believe to be the fuselage of the plane in recent days. Five other big objects have been found on the floor of the ocean, though no visual confirmation has been obtained yet . Five other big objects have been found on the floor of the ocean, though no visual confirmation has been obtained yet. Smaller pieces of the plane, such as seats and an emergency door, have been collected from the surface. Tony Fernandes, AirAsia's chief executive officer, welcomed the news. If it is the right part of the tail section, he tweeted, then the cockpit voice and flight data recorders, or black boxes, 'should be there'. He said the airline's priority still is to recover all the bodies 'to ease the pain of our families'. One released image appeared to show an upside down 'A'' painted on a piece of metal, while another grainy shot depicted some mechanical parts. So far, 40 corpses have been found, including an additional one announced Wednesday, but time is running out. At two weeks, most corpses will sink, said Anton Castilani, head of Indonesia's disaster identification victim unit, and there are already signs of serious decomposition. Officials are hopeful many of the more than 122 bodies still unaccounted for will be found inside the fuselage, which is believed to be lying near the tail. Just before losing contact, the pilot told air traffic control he was approaching threatening clouds, but was denied permission to climb to a higher altitude because of heavy air traffic. No distress signal was issued.","Signals from the black box of AirAsia Flight 8501 were detected then lost .

"A German nurse today admitted to killing 30 patients in his care because he was 'bored' and wanted to show off his 'excellent' resuscitation skills. Nils. H., 38, is being tried for three specimen murders by injecting patients with a dangerous medicine. The ex-nurse went on trial in Oldenburg in northern Germany in September and today claimed responsibility for dozens of deaths at the clinic he worked at. Nils. H. (pictured left concealing his face as he arrives for his trial) today admitted to killing 30 patients in his care because he was 'bored' and wanted to show off his 'excellent' resuscitation skills . After he was arrested, the nurse explained to police 'I was bored' - and prosecutors say he was keen to show off his CPR skills. According to the prosecution, if the first attempt at resuscitation was a success, he would sometimes make a second attempt. The nurse, whose full name is withheld under German privacy laws, used Gilurytmal, a medication which should only be used by doctors under strict supervision, it was said. Side effects include an irregular heartbeat, a drop in blood pressure and uncoordinated functioning of the heart muscle. Prosecutors in the district court of Oldenburg said Nils. H. (pictured) could be involved in more than 150 deaths . Though the nurse is facing charges over three murders and two attempted murders, the state prosecutor said he could be involved in more than 150 deaths. In cooperation with the police, the state prosecutor is currently investigating the deaths of 174 patients who died during Nils. H.'s shifts  at a clinic in Delmenhorst, near Bremen, between 2003 and 2005. The investigators will also look into deaths at Nils. H.'s previous jobs in Oldenburg and Wilhelmshaven and dozens of bodies will be exhumed. In 2008, Nils. H. was  sentenced to seven-and-a-half years for the attempted murder of another patient. He gave his patient an overdose of heart medication, with the man narrowly escaping death. The ex-nurse went on trial in Oldenburg in northern Germany in September and today claimed responsibility for dozens of deaths at the clinic he worked at . The death rate in the Delmenhorst clinic nearly doubled in the time Nils. H. worked there, and use of the heart medication also increased dramatically. But it took nearly a decade before an investigation was launched, angering relatives of the dead who are demanding information. A senior doctor who gave evidence in September said Nils. H. was a 'passionate medic' who made a good impression on staff at the clinic. But the doctor added: 'I found it strange that he was always on hand when patients were being resuscitated, often helping younger doctors with intubation - inserting a breathing tube into a patient's airways.' 'No one wants to believe that a colleague would rather kill patients, instead of helping them,' said Erich Joester, a lawyer for the clinic. He said that the increased death rate had been attributed to a number of causes rather than a rogue individual. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","German nurse Nils.
