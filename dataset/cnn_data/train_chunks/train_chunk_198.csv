"Rio de Janeiro (CNN) -- As Brazilian authorities work to ""pacify"" Brazil's slums ahead of two global sporting events, police in Rio de Janeiro captured one of the city's most notorious drug traffickers. Antonio Francisco Bonfim Lopes, alias ""Nem,"" was found hiding Wednesday in the trunk of a car attempting to avoid a police siege in the outskirts of Rocinha, a slum in the heart of Rio that was under his control, police said. But the car was stopped at a police checkpoint, and a confusing scene unfolded. The driver of the car told police he was a Congolese diplomat and refused to open the trunk, police said. He then partly relented, saying he would only open it at the federal police station. On the way there, police said, the car stopped again and one of its occupants offered the officers 20,000 reais (U.S. $11,400) in exchange for their freedom. When the officer declined, the offer was raised to 1 million reais (U.S. $572,000), police said. The local officers called in federal police, who conducted an immediate search of the vehicle and discovered Lopes in the trunk, police said. The driver claimed to be an ""honorary consul"" of ""Congo,"" but the embassy of the Republic of Congo told the state-run Agencia Brasil that they have no consul in the country, and the Democratic Republic of Congo said it has no diplomatic mission there. A second passenger in the car was identified as an attorney and a third man also claimed to be an employee of the consulate. Rio will play host to the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics, and has turned its attention to restoring control of the slums, or favelas, that had been in the hands of criminals and gangs. Rocinha is one of Brazil's biggest favelas and one of the main strongholds of the drug dealing in the country. Rocinha is a community with nearly 70,000 residents, according to the last census. Lopes controlled the drug trafficking in that favelas for nearly 10 years.","Brazil is working to regain control of Rio's slums .

"(CNN) -- Having a heart attack is often a wake-up call for people to change their lives, whether that means quitting smoking, eating healthier or simply focusing on doing the things they enjoy. But surviving a heart attack can trigger anxiety, too: What if it happens again? And while many men and women may worry that their heart will give out during a vigorous exercise session, an even bigger concern seems to be sex. To address this fear, the American Heart Association recently released its first-ever guidelines for helping health care providers advise patients about resuming a healthy sex life following a heart attack, stroke, heart transplant or other cardiovascular procedure. It may sound pretty standard, but the truth is that, until now, patients have received little to no counseling about this important issue. In fact, a study last year of 1,900 heart attack patients suggests that just one-third of women and less than half of men received instructions about resuming sexual activity after they left the hospital -- and were 44% more likely to report that they still hadn't had sex a year later. Another recent study found that very few female heart attack patients are given advice from their physicians about resuming sex. The new AHA guidelines are aimed at educating health care professionals about the importance of discussing sex with their cardiovascular patients, but they also offer insight for patients themselves. ""These are important recommendations that acknowledge the hesitancy of couples to resume their sexual activity, even though the actual risk of worsening with sexual activity is extremely low,"" says my colleague Dr. Madeleine Castellanos. Does your relationship need a 'love drug'? Here are some highlights from the guidelines: . Sex isn't as risky as you fear. It's natural to be concerned about being sexually active after a heart attack or other cardiovascular problem. But it's unlikely that sex will trigger another attack in most people. According to the AHA, if you don't experience cardiac symptoms (such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and dizziness) during exercise, you probably won't experience them in bed. It's helpful to think of sex the way you might think of other activities that require exertion, such as walking up stairs, exercising, or returning to a generally active lifestyle. If your doctor doesn't offer, ask for an exercise ""stress"" test: If you can walk on a treadmill at a pace of about 3 to 4 miles per hour, you should be fine, says the AHA. Your sex life may change -- and that's OK. As I mentioned earlier, many people take a cardiac event as an opportunity to make some changes to their lifestyle. While you certainly may be able to return to the same sex life you had before, you may want to reassess things between the sheets. The AHA recommends considering positions that are comfortable -- the partner on top during intercourse usually exerts more energy, for example. If you're not ready to return to sex completely, don't miss out on other forms of physical intimacy, such as hugging, kissing, cuddling, and touching each other. Masturbation can be a healthy way of easing back into things, too. When your child walks in during sex . Women are not small men. Research suggests that rates of erectile dysfunction among men with cardiovascular disease are twice as high as those without the condition. But women may experience their own sexual challenges, both before and after a heart attack. ""I appreciate that the AHA was careful to point out that women's sexuality can often get marginalized, and that their sexual complaints regarding lubrication and excitation should be seen as a serious indicator of possible cardiovascular disease, just as it is in men with ED,"" says Castellanos. Communication is key. The major takeaway message from the AHA guidelines is that doctors and patients must put aside any embarrassment and talk about sex openly. ""I hope that all health professionals will recognize the importance of sexual counseling and appreciate the importance that it has for people's quality of life,"" says Castellanos. Unfortunately, not all doctors and nurses may feel comfortable broaching the subject, so you may have to raise it yourself. Just think of your sexuality as part of your overall health, and be sure to ask all of your questions, from when can you have sex again, to how to deal with fears and anxieties. It may not be easy at first, but talking with your doctor -- and your partner -- about your concerns can go a long way to helping you get back in the swing of things.

"(CNN) -- The ""mommy war"" between stay-at-home and working mothers is in danger of being overshadowed by another maddening contest: the one between mothers in the U.S. and France. Two recent books, Pamela Druckerman's ""Bringing Up Bébé"" and Karen Le Billon's ""French Kids Eat Everything,"" make the case that French parents raise kids who behave and eat far better than their American counterparts. This month, the English language debut of the European bestseller by French philosopher Elisabeth Badinter, ""The Conflict: How Modern Motherhood Undermines the Status of Women,"" is already causing a stir. Badinter argues that overwhelming numbers of French mamans manage to work full-time and have several kids because they haven't succumbed to intensive ideals of motherhood, most of all American-style ""natural mothering.""  Think extended breastfeeding, nonmedicalized birth, co-sleeping, and cloth diapers. Commentators are already jumping on Badinter's polemic as mommy war fodder.  Does La Leche League oppress women?  Is the environmental movement, or feminism, to blame? It's been a busy season indeed for chroniclers of the faux mommy wars.  But as usual, that war is more farce than reality.  Fini, everyone. The global battle between mamans and mamas, just as the one between stay-at-home and working moms, is largely staged.  The sometimes jazzy headlines -- such as ""The conflict attacks progressive parenting as anti-feminist"" on April 10 in The Washington Post -- do a disservice to the complex lives of women. Creating two categories of mothers pits one against the other, and obscures the way traditional mommy-dividing categories often overlap. Women frequently opt in and out and back from paid work. Conversations about that fabricated domestic war and the latest international one obscure real differences linked to factors such as class and education.  And of course, ""French"" and ""American"" simplify the lives of millions of mothers in both countries. If, instead, we actually read these books, we would realize that these authors are trying to offer solutions to the same problems in different ways.  We admit it's hardly as sexy as the Hilary Rosen-Ann Romney showdown, whereby stay-at-home motherhood became partisan fodder after the Democratic strategist Rosen criticized Mitt Romney for turning to his wife, who has ""never worked a day in her life,"" for counsel on the economic issues working mothers face.  But we ought to slow down long enough to hear what these authors say before pulling our guns.  There are kernels of wisdom here. Badinter, for example, wants all women (and particularly those who are French) to resist ideals of mothering that view women as the primary, more ""natural"" caregiver, which can make it all the more difficult to balance motherhood with work and a full, adult life. We applaud the way she asks us to examine these intensive ideals of motherhood and their reach. No woman should feel shame because she fails to breastfeed or give birth without an epidural.  More fundamentally, we agree that care-giving shouldn't be the province of women alone. We disagree with Badinter, however, that the obstacles are merely in our heads.  We think they're in political structures, too.  Despite Badinter dismissing as irrelevant the French policies that make health care and day care accessible and affordable, here in the U.S., we lack such support for parents, mothers in particular, who work and do the second shift at home. The battle for pumHping stations and flextime seems a worthier cause than the trumped-up war between those who breastfeed and those who don't.  Surely natural mothering practices would not be so oppressive and disadvantageous to women if we set up society to accommodate them. And while we're on it, the focus on breasts is a diversion.  As a mother said in an interview when Badinter's book came out in France, the real conflict is not between the mother and the woman,  but the woman and the company.  When Badinter rejects breastfeeding so mothers can retain their sexuality, one could argue she is merely replacing the tyranny  of ""breasts for bébé"" for the tyranny of ""breasts for men."" Still, Badinter has good points, and we shouldn't be so offended as to let the criticism of our parenting overshadow the reality that we, in the United States, have a long way to go.  Perhaps there is something to American mothers' nostalgia for the French way of life, like authors Judith Warner, Jennifer Conlin, Le Billon and Druckerman, all who have raised children in France. You don't have to be an anthropologist to know that other cultural perspectives can shed light on how we've constructed particular ideals of motherhood and family, how our government and workplaces value -- or don't value -- motherhood. Perhaps the French experience might be a reminder that, with a revolution, structures can, and do, change. The solution to the challenges of American parenting is hardly as simple as making children eat spinach, or privileging disposable diapers over cloth. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","Writers: The first ""mommy war"" pitted stay-at-home against working mothers .
Now, three books extoll the virtues of the French mothering style, they say .

"(CNN) -- Children's lives are at risk in swimming pools across the country as government agencies waffle on how to enforce a new federal law, child safety advocates say. A child's stomach shows the injuries of being sucked into a drain in a swimming pool. The law requires new drain covers on pool filtration systems. The covers prevent children from being caught in the suction, disemboweled and completely eviscerated -- ""turning your insides basically into your outsides,"" said Alan Korn, public policy director of Safe Kids USA, a Washington-based nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing injuries to children. But despite the dangers -- and the federal law -- many pools are not in compliance with the law. It went into effect December 19, and pool operators have known about it for more than a year. Some children caught in the drains can be saved, though they might be paralyzed. Some will bear the scars, in the form of welts shaped like the drain, on their bodies forever. But others die. Kids like Virginia Graeme Baker. The 7-year-old granddaughter of former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, who went by her middle name, was in a hot tub during a school graduation party in Virginia in 2002. Her horrified twin sister ran to their mother, Nancy Baker, saying Graeme was trapped. ""The tub was just dark. I couldn't see anything,"" Baker said. ""Only bubbles."" But when she jumped in and stuck her head under the water, she saw her daughter. Her daughter's eyes were pinched shut, and her limbs were being ripped in every direction by the suction. She was ""essentially cemented"" to the bottom of the pool. ""I was thinking she was tied down or caught on something,"" Baker said. ""Honestly, I couldn't figure it out. All that adrenaline was running through me, and I was just trying to get her out."" With all of her strength, Baker tried to pry her daughter free from the hundreds of pounds of suction force. ""I couldn't understand why, despite all of my efforts, I couldn't pry her free. I couldn't get her off the drain,"" Baker said. It took two other adults to pry Baker's daughter free. When Baker got to the hospital, doctors said there was nothing they could do. Her daughter was gone. So Baker went on a crusade of sorts to raise awareness and help save other children from what Korn calls ""particularly horrific deaths."" ""There's a moment in time when the child realizes that something is wrong, that they can't break themselves from the suction,"" Korn said. The statistics for entrapment are probably grossly underestimated (only 33 deaths have been officially listed as being caused by entrapment between 1985 and 2004) because nobody knew the dangers that lurked at the bottom of the pool, according to Safe Kids USA, which was founded by Children's National Medical Center in Washington. That was until Baker, Safe Kids USA and legislators lobbied for a law so those deaths were not in vain. The law applies to all pools with public access, including those at hotels, apartments and residential communities. But experts advise owners of residential pools, like the one Virginia Graeme Baker died in, to make the modifications, too. Several pool operators nationwide who spoke to CNN said they simply weren't given enough time to get the covers and claimed some models weren't available until weeks before the law went into effect. Others said the models they requested are on back order.  See how one town is handling the change » . Complicating matters further is the different way that states are enforcing the law. Because the agency overseeing the law -- the Consumer Product Safety Commission -- is so small, it is looking to state public health and safety departments for help. And some states and towns are being more lenient than others enforcing the law. Baker says there should be only one standard: saving children's lives. ""If you make the choice not to put on this cover, you're leaving open the chance for a child to sit on a drain and then be so horribly injured that they'd be without their intestines, without their colon, and basically live a life on a feeding tube,"" Baker said. Still, many states are allowing pools to remain open, or at least have not begun inspecting the pools and actively shutting them down. Without offering details, some health and safety officials said the law wasn't being followed because they didn't have the authority to enforce it.  See examples of safe and unsafe drain covers » . The public health department in Riverside, California, said it will not enforce the law until a similar law is passed by the state legislature. The Connecticut Department of Health said that although the law wasn't on the books in that state either, it was the ""expectation"" that state and local health departments would close noncompliant pools. ""I know I wouldn't let my child swim in a pool without these new covers, and I'd give that advice to any stranger,"" Korn said. ""Nobody should be in these pools."" Heeding that advice, some pools across the country have closed or been shut down, including those at several high schools. For some, it was a city decision. In some cases, state health departments granted extensions if the pools turn off the suction at the bottom until covers arrive. For others, like a baby pool at the North Platte, Nebraska, Recreation Complex, the decision to shut the pool came at the request of insurance companies. Scott Wolfson, a spokesman for the safety commission, said the agency that knows some pool operators have problems obtaining the drain covers and said it is focusing its efforts on the most high-risk pools, such as wading pools, kiddie pools and the shallow end of larger pools. Wolfson said that ultimately, a pool owner will be held liable if there is an injury or a death at a pool lacking the proper drain covers. Jeff Long, communications director for the Fox Valley Park District in Illinois, has been waiting for drain covers for the pools he oversees. But he hasn't gotten them. ""It's not a matter of us ignoring the law,"" Long said, adding that many of the pools he oversees will remain open. ""We obviously want to protect children, but what can we do if we can't get the product we need to save them?"" The answer is simple for Baker: shut down the pool until you get the product. ""Everyone has the mentality of 'it can't happen here; it won't happen to me,' "" Baker said. ""If you would have told me eight years ago that there was any chance that I'd live out the rest of my life thinking about the fact that my child was cemented at the bottom of a hot tub, I'd say that was impossible, but it does happen, and it always leads to grisly, devastating misery or death. How can anyone be OK with that?""","New federal law requires drain covers that prevent children from being sucked in .

"(CNN) -- Western companies operating in Africa have long underestimated the continent's consumers, according to a top executive in one of the world's biggest consumer goods groups. Frank Braeken, executive vice president of Unilever in Africa, said that for a long time multinationals have thought of the vast continent as a ""monolithic"" market, failing to address its diversity. ""The African consumer has been underestimated, underserved and underserviced,"" said Braeken. ""What I mean is we have looked at it a little bit generically, like 'the Africans,' a little bit patronizing generically. Now we start to take the African consumer seriously."" Unilever, the maker of brands such as Lipton and Knorr, has been active in the continent for more than a century, with a presence in 15 countries and employing thousands of workers there. Read more: Are one in three Africans really middle class? Yet, despite its long history and deep presence, Braeken acknowledged that the company had been slow in engaging with the diverse types of consumers in the continent. ""I'm almost somewhat ashamed to admit that we are still very much in learning mode about what the differences are within Africa."" Braeken said that it was becoming increasingly clear that there were major differences between the different countries in the continent. ""What we now increasingly do is we think much more in terms of sub-clusters, where you have east Africa, where you have west Africa, where you have southern Africa,"" he said. ""It is more about how you define the brand mix, how you bring it to the consumer, that we localize and that we make it relevant for the local consumer."" A recent survey by Nielsen has identified seven types of consumers that companies targeting African markets need to be aware of. ""Rather than just a continent, Africa must be viewed as 54 separate and distinct countries with a wide array of political, economic, geographical, cultural and social features,"" said Nielsen's ""The Diverse People of Africa"" report. According to the research firm, there is no ""single African consumer."" Instead, Nielsen says its seven types of consumers can be grouped in three tiers based on monthly income and average spending. In the first tier belong the ""Trendy Aspirants"" and ""Progressive Affluents"" (wealthy, urban, well-educated Africans with high income and consumer packaged goods spending (CPG)). The second group is comprised of ""Balanced Seniors"" and ""Struggling Traditionals"" (middle aged, mid-income Africans with average CPG category spend), while the third one includes ""Evolving Juniors,"" ""Wannabe Bachelors"" and ""Female Conservatives"" (this is the continent's biggest tier, consisting of consumers who spend much less than average on CPG categories -- see fact box). Meanwhile, household spending in Africa is projected to increase from $860 billion in 2008 to $1.4 trillion in 2020, according to a report by McKinsey. The growth in spending on consumer goods, telecoms and banking can turn Africa's consumers into an increasingly attractive business proposition, creating markets large enough to be appealing for multinational firms, said McKinsey. Read more: EasyJet founder to launch low-cost airline in Africa . Braeken said the emergence of a stronger middle class is only one part of the story. He argued that the focus should be on how companies can foster innovation and organizational capability to tap the collective spending power of both the high and low ends of the continent's consumer market. ""By having a product that is more affordable you reach down, so certainly you have more consumers in your catchment area,"" he said, noting that Unilever has doubled the number of stores it goes to physically in the last few years to over 400,000. ""So certainly your products can be found in more places in Africa, so you expand your catchment area -- that to us is the real story of our growth in Africa at this moment."" Looking ahead, Braeken said he was very positive about the continent's future but warned that there were still many issues that needed to be addressed, citing infrastructure, good governance, corruption and fostering local talent. ""I'm very optimistic about Africa, but I say it always with a tinge of hesitation because one of the big risks is that we get carried away and therefore forget to talk about the real challenges that are still ahead of it,"" he said. ""We have to keep on talking about the real issues and then I am sure that Africa can continue that path that it's on now, and we will see not only Unilever but many other companies easily double in size from what they are today.""","Frank Braeken is the executive vice president of Unilever in Africa .

"(CNN) -- Liam Neeson was already an Academy Award-nominated star when director Pierre Morel's ""Taken"" was released in 2008, but the movie's sleeper success made audiences look at the actor differently. His portrayal of Bryan Mills, a former CIA operative on the hunt for his daughter's sex-trafficking kidnappers, became a cult success and made him a full-fledged action star at almost 60. As such, ""Taken 2"" barreled into theaters this weekend, bringing in $50 million. It's the first film to make that much in three days since ""The Dark Knight Rises"" in July. ""Taken 2"" is not so much a sequel as it is an extension of the first movie. The Albanian brothers of Neeson's victims demand vengeance. ""The dead cry out to us for justice,"" says Murad Krasniqi, the film's villain played by Rade Serbedzija. This time the director is France's Olivier Megaton, who reportedly adopted his last name because his birthday falls on August 6, 1965, 20 years after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Japan. It would seem subtlety isn't his forte or his movie's. Review: 'Taken 2' Espionage is synonymous with explosions in the ""Taken"" series, along with pretty much every film representation of the CIA -- from Jack Ryan to Jason Bourne. ""That's always the intention in Hollywood,"" says Melissa Boyle Mahle. ""That's the Hollywood shortcut."" A covert CIA operative for 16 years, Mahle knows about what she's talking. ""My area of expertise was the Middle East and counterterrorism,"" she says. ""I did the classic work that Americans think spies do overseas."" She chronicles her experience, as much as she's able to, in her book ""Denial and Deception: An Insider's View of the CIA."" The book takes a look at Mahle's work as well as the post-Cold War culture and structural issues with the agency. Considering Mahle's blond hair, you think she'd stick out like a sore thumb in that part of the world. ""You can certainly blend in if you are of Middle Eastern ethnicity, but we adopt cover stories that allow us to live, work and move through these societies in ways that look very natural and normal within the context of their engagement with foreigners,"" she says. Sometimes that also included traditional dresses and veils. ""We know the language, we know the societal norms -- things we can and cannot do and what will draw attention to you."" Neeson throws any form of clandestine operations out the window as the Albanian terrorists take him and his ex-wife, played by Famke Janssen, into their desolate torture room of chains and pipes. After his ex-wife is hung upside down with a bag over her head, Mills calls his daughter Kim (who was taken in the first ""Taken"" film). The first plan is for her to make her way to a U.S. Embassy, but she refuses. She needs to help her father despite the post-traumatic stress disorder she may be suffering from after her own sex-trafficking experience. ""You can only train so much for something like that,"" Mahle says of an abduction scenario. ""We know that when you're caught by a terrorist, you have a bad outcome in front of you, and you hope for either immediate rescue or a quick death."" But operatives know the risk, Mahle says. ""If you're going to be so focused on the risks, you're not going to be able to do your job."" Mills' Plan B involves his daughter using a shoelace, a sharpie and some hand grenades thrown on the streets of Istanbul, Turkey, to help pinpoint his location. From an audience standpoint, it makes no sense and perfect sense all at once. ""It's very hard to be a clandestine operator if every time you walk through the door something blows up,"" Mahle says. ""That makes a good film, but it doesn't make very good operations. Espionage, by its very nature, is a mind game. People don't wake up and decide to trigger countries in vengeance on a whim."" The vengeance in ""Taken 2"" is in full force as Kim and her father seek to sort out the group of Albanian misfits. This includes a wild ride through the streets that is a bit of a ridiculous premise but does allow for some father-daughter bonding time that's important given the pair's somewhat rocky relationship. Mills' relationship with his ex-wife is also strained because of his former career as a CIA operative. ""It takes a special kind of person to live in a world that we create for ourselves,"" Mahle says. ""In your personal relationships that are not part of that clandestine world, there is an element of omission and people can feel that."" Despite the opportunity for leaving out details about her life, Mahle points out that her whole career was based around figuring out people. ""I've been married to my husband for forever, and we figured out a way to make it work."" But living undercover means lying to everyone -- including children. ""Here we are trying to (raise) upstanding, honest Americans, but we're lying to them from Day One, and we're doing it for the specific reason of protecting national security,"" Mahle says. ""When you choose that moment to say, 'By the way son, I've been lying to you all along,' that's hard.'

"Washington (CNN) -- Marijuana cultivation in Mexico increased 35 percent in 2008 and continues to grow, even as authorities there push forward with a large offensive against drug cartels that smuggle the product into the United States, according to a State Department report released this week. The 2010 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR), is a yearly report that assess anti-drug efforts around the world. The part of the report dealing with Mexico is illuminating because most of the illegal drugs in the United States are transported and smuggled through there. ""There's a broad impact in the United States of cartel operations that are based or emanating from Mexico,"" Assistant Secretary of State David T. Johnson said at the news conference where the report was released. The report could be additional fuel for critics who say that Mexican President Felipe Calderon's war against the drug cartels has been ineffective at stopping the drug violence or the flow of illegal drugs. ""Despite the efforts of the (Mexican government), drug cultivation rose significantly in 2009 according to U.S. government agencies' estimates,"" the report stated. In 2008, 12,000 hectacres were used for marijuana cultivation, up from 8,900 in 2007. The 35 percent increase is the most recent statistic available, and marks a 16-year high. Mexico also eradicated fewer marijuana plants than in previous years, the study said. ""Much of this can be attributed to Mexican law enforcement's shift in focus to harder drugs such as methamphetamine as well as more military and law enforcement resources being diverted to confront the (cartels) and violence,"" the report said. In the State Department's assessment, Mexico fared better in other areas. By November of last year, Mexico had already seized more metric tons of cocaine than in 2008, 20 compared to 19.

"London (CNN) -- On the pitch, he is known as a combative defender whose marauding runs down the left flank have helped him establish himself as one of football's most enterprising fullbacks. Off the pitch, however, Tottenham Hotspur left back Benoit Assou-Ekotto is far from your ordinary top-level footballer. Opinionated and strong-minded, Assou-Ekotto's surprisingly candid views have often been at odds with the monotonous, if not pretentious, rhetoric that often surrounds the beautiful game. The French-born Cameroonian international has famously admitted that he's playing the sport just for the money on offer. He's grabbed headlines by saying every player is driven by riches and has openly criticized badge-kissing peers of ""hypocrisy."" The refreshingly open, yet soft-spoken, player describes football as a ""very, very, very good job,"" but says there are more important things in life. He shies away from the celebrity lifestyle favored by many of his English Premier League colleagues and has few friends within football. ""For me it's very important to have a normal friend and not only friends in football because you can see the reality and the difficulty of the life, [which] you can forget as your job is a very good job,"" he explains. Watch video: Assou-Ekotto on race relations in France . Is he concerned whether some of his comments can be seen in a negative way? ""I'm honest and I say what I think,"" says Assou-Ekotto, who is known as much for his frank comments as his eye-catching hairstyles. ""If you don't like, I don't care -- I know how I speak maybe will not help me, but I don't care and I have too much confidence in me."" With a French mother and having grown up in the city of Arras, northern France, Assou-Ekotto, 28, could have played for the French national team. But he turned his back on ""Les Bleus,"" opting instead to play for the country of his father's origin. He says he's no turncoat -- he just never had an emotional connection with Europe, unlike his strong Cameroonian roots. ""I have more feeling with Cameroon and Africa,"" he explains. Assou-Ekotto says that his decision to play in Africa does limit his earning potential at club level in Europe. He claims African players don't earn the same wages as other players, partly because they have to play in the Africa Cup of Nations. The tournament, which is usually held every two years, takes many of the continent's top football stars out of action for their club teams at a critical period in the European domestic season. See: Africa Cup of Nations 2013 team guide . ""When you make a choice and play for an African [national] team, the football will be more difficult for you because you have the Africa Cup of Nations and there's not a club [that] wants their footballers to travel one month out in the middle of the season,"" he says. ""A French player or an English player or a Belgium player or a Spain player would be all the time more expensive as an African player -- it's like that, it's a reality."" Yet, for Assou-Ekotto, the choice to represent Cameroon's ""Indomitable Lions"" was easy to make. ""I prefer to be proud to play for my country, even if my football will be more difficult, [than] to play for France and don't have a feeling,"" he says. See: NBA boss finding Africa's basketball stars . Assou- Ekotto, who joined Tottenham from French outfit Lens in the summer of 2006, comes from a fine footballing pedigree. His older brother Mathieu played top-flight football in Belgium, while his dad, David, left Cameroon for France as a teenager to play professionally. Assou-Ekotto's footballing education came from watching matches with his dad, who was an astute mentor, passing on the nuances of the sport. ""Every weekend when I was about 10 I go with him to see football and to play football and then I said, it's a good job,"" remembers Assou-Ekotto. ""I said, okay, I will focus only on the football."" Disinterested with learning in the classroom, Assou-Ekotto dropped out of school at the age of 16 to pursue his sporting ambition. But although his gamble has paid off, Assou-Ekotto says today he regrets not completing high school. His view on the importance of education has prompted him to start BA32, a foundation promoting the idea of teaching youth in a practical and interesting way, focused on encouraging children across the globe to learn more about mathematics, science and technology. ""When I make this foundation [it] is to give the opportunity to a young boy to understand that the education and the school is very important because you know when you are young you don't see the real problems of the life; to sleep under the roof you have to pay every month,"" he says. ""I think it is more easy to pay this kind of stuff when you are clever and when you have a good job."" Assou-Ekotto is keen for his philanthropy, rather than his sporting success, to be his lasting legacy. ""I prefer to be remembered about what I will do after football because every weekend about 40,000 people enjoy with me and my team but I hope to help more than 40,000 people after football over the world,"" he says. ""People need help and that will be more interesting for me. People [will remember me] not just as a footballer, because I am not just a footballer.""

"(CNN) -- A Tunisian, who authorities believe radicalized one of the suspects held in Canada on charges of plotting to blow up a passenger train, has been arrested in New York on unrelated counts, according to authorities who said he wanted to commit acts of terror in the United States. Ahmed Abassi was arrested last month and charged in a newly unsealed indictment with two counts of making false statements to immigration authorities while applying for a work visa and green card. ""As alleged, Ahmed Abassi had an evil purpose for seeking to remain in the United States -- to commit acts of terror and develop a network of terrorists here, and to use this country as a base to support the efforts of terrorists internationally,"" said Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Much of the discovery in the case originated from recordings between Abassi and an undercover agent who spoke Arabic. They still must be translated and much of the material remains classified, prosecutor John Cronan said. In court documents, prosecutors allege Abassi radicalized Chiheb Esseghaier, who then allegedly traveled overseas for training and plotted ""to engage in terrorist activity in the West."" Esseghaier was arrested in Canada in April in a high-profile terror case. According to a U.S. intelligence official and another government official, Esseghaier, 30, of Montreal and another suspect plotted to put explosives under a trestle and set them off after a passenger train crossed from the United States into Canada. Abassi previously lived in Canada, traveled to the United States in mid-March and was under surveillance by law enforcement until he was arrested on April 22, said prosecutors. He allegedly met with Esseghaier in New York City. A man who neither Abassi or Esseghaier knew was an undercover officer also was present during their discussions and secretly recorded the conversations, said the government. During the meeting with Esseghaier, Abassi allegedly ""discussed his desire to engage in terrorist acts against targets in the United States and other countries, and his intention to provide support and funding to organizations engaged in terrorist activity, including the al Nusrah Front,"" according to a letter prosecutors wrote to a federal judge. The al Nusrah Front is an organization commonly referred to as al Qaeda in Iraq. Abassi also allegedly said he wanted to recruit other like-minded people for acts of terrorism. The letter adds that Abassi told the person he didn't realize was an undercover officer that Esseghaier's plans were good but the timing for them was not right. Abassi allegedly said he had a plan involving ""contaminating the air or water with bacteria in order to kill up to 100,000 people"" but he said Esseghaier was dismissive. The documents do not specify whether Abassi had a location in mind for such an attack. Abassi allegedly discussed with the undercover officer his plans to obtain immigration documents fraudulently so he could stay in the United States and engage in terrorism, and his plan included a claim that he was working for a company owned by the undercover agent. The documents did not say whether Abassi knew of the foiled Canadian rail plot. Albassi appeared in federal court in New York Thursday. Each of the two charges against him carries up to 25 years in prison. CNN's Gloria Borger, Paula Newton and Pam Benson contributed to this report.","Man was arrested in New York last month, charged with immigration counts .

"(CNN) -- Can I level with you? The guy made me nervous. All those flashy jump cuts and strobe-like visual progressions from one scene to another! I don't go to movies to make myself more nervous. I go to movies to slow time down or make it vanish altogether. The movies of Tony Scott, who jumped to his death Sunday from a bridge in Los Angeles, were high, hard adrenaline shots injected into the audience's collective nervous system to make time (and your head) explode. His name on the credits virtually assured the moviegoer of a ride that rivaled Disney World's Space Mountain for gut-wrenching, head-spinning thrills that would leave you wobbly at the end. British director Tony Scott dead after jumping from California bridge . They weren't to everyone's taste -- and not always to mine. And yet, I am altogether certain that over the next several decades, Scott's movies will be among the very first pored over by cinema scholars tracing the development of the action-movie genre, cultural historians seeking clues as to the jittery mood swings of the American mindset at the turn of the 21st century and aspiring filmmakers who simply want to know how the hell he mesmerized people in the first place. Establishing Tom Cruise and Denzel Washington as action movie icons, however considerable (or unlikely) that achievement, isn't even half of Scott's legacy. Unlike his older brother Ridley, whose credits roamed the categorical countryside from science fiction (""Blade Runner,"" ""Alien"") to period adventure (""Gladiator,"" ""Kingdom of Heaven"") to contemporary bloodbaths (""American Gangster,"" ""Black Hawk Down""), Tony Scott maintained a signature style throughout his career that arguably yielded a steadier rate of success. His first feature, the 1983 erotic vampire mood piece ""The Hunger,"" ended up a relative anomaly (except in sheer style) to such high-octane thrill machines as ""Top Gun"" (1986), ""Revenge"" (1990), ""The Last Boy Scout"" (1991), ""True Romance"" (1993), ""Crimson Tide"" (1995), ""Enemy of the State"" (1998), ""Man on Fire"" (2004), ""Domino"" (2005), ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" (2009) and ""Unstoppable"" (2010). ""Top Gun"" director left notes before jump . Most of these movies -- and their protagonists -- were governed by seemingly impossible deadlines. To watch ""Last Boy Scout,"" ""Crimson Tide,"" ""Enemy of the State,"" ""Pelham"" and ""Unstoppable"" is to feel pressed for time. Their heroes had no time to think, and neither did you. Propulsion, urgency, energy-for-the-sake-of-its-expenditure were the only guiding principles of Scott's movies, and yet as you were pressed against your seat by their momentum, you somehow couldn't help being transfixed by the images. The change of each frame from oily to sooty, from sleek to parched, from cramped to wide-open, seemed at once abrupt and flowing. Maybe the din and distortions weren't your flagon of grog. But few filmmakers before or since have been able to consistently orchestrate such maddening elements into a metal rock flow. Having a good script always helps -- and Quentin Tarantino's contributions to both ""True Romance"" and ""Crimson Tide"" make those the Tony Scott movies that the smarty-pants critics like to single out. ""Top Gun"" will remain the first thing people mention when they mention his name, and there's a lot to be said for the charm and efficiency of the relatively laid-back but no less riveting ""Unstoppable."" (It's almost as if he was starting to calm down at last.) But grump that I am, the Scott movie I'm going to single out for special scrutiny is one of his least successful -- at least, financially. ""Domino,"" whose story was inspired by the real-life adventures of a movie star's daughter turned bounty hunter (played by Keira Knightley) is one of the more subversive action epics ever made, precisely because of the things that drive you crazy about it: set pieces that make you dizzy and giddy at the same time, patchwork plot devices that literally veer all over the map, lighting and scenery oozing raw menace and hyperbolic performances that somehow stay fixed on the narrative core. I didn't always enjoy it as I was watching it. But parts of it stuck with me long afterward. I could say the same for most of Tony Scott's films -- and, for that matter, his entire career.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson traveled with what amounted to a mini-clinic and an anesthesiologist who used a surgical anesthetic to put the singer to sleep after shows during his ""HIStory"" tour, sources close to Jackson told CNN just days after his death. But Paul Gongaware testified Friday that he never saw indications Jackson used drugs or traveled with a doctor when he managed that tour in 1996 and 1997. What Gongaware knew -- or didn't know -- about Jackson's drug use is a key issue as the Jackson wrongful death trial enters its sixth week Monday in Los Angeles. The co-CEO of AEG Live -- the concert promotion company being sued by Jackson's mother and children -- returns for a fifth day of testimony Monday. The Jackson family contends AEG Live is liable in Jackson's 2009 death because it negligently hired, retained or supervised Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Gongaware was the top producer of Jackson's comeback concerts when the singer died of an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol. It was Gongaware who negotiated the deal to pay Dr. Murray $150,000 a month to be Jackson's physician for the ""This Is It"" tour. Jackson lawyers argue that Gongaware should have known the hazards of hiring the doctor because of his personal experience with Jackson -- and his work with other artists, including on Elvis Presley's last tour. AEG Live lawyers contend their executives had no way of knowing that Murray was using propofol to treat Jackson's insomnia because the singer was very good at keeping his ""deepest, darkest secret."" ""AEG knew nothing about this decade-long propofol use,"" AEG Live lawyer Marvin Putnam said in his opening statements. ""They were a concert promoter. How could they know?"" What killed Elvis? It's a question at Jackson's death trial . Gongaware, under questioning by his own lawyer Friday, testified that he only became aware that Jackson was addicted to painkillers when the singer made a public announcement after his ""Dangerous"" tour abruptly ended so he could enter rehab in 1993. He was a manager for the ""Dangerous"" tour, but only handled logistics and didn't travel with Jackson then, he said. His job on the second half of the ""HIStory"" tour, however, carried more responsibilities and he worked closely with Jackson, he said. Gongaware testified that he saw ""no indication at all"" that Jackson was using drugs during that tour. ""I would be certain to notice it if that was the case."" Did Jackson have a doctor treating him during the ""HIStory"" tour, his lawyer asked. ""Not that I know of,"" he answered. In fact, Jackson was ""sensational"" on stage, performing 10 to 12 shows a month, he said. Unlike in the ""Dangerous"" tour, he never canceled a show because of his health. ""He only missed one,"" he said. ""That was when Princess Diana died. He heard about the accident, went to bed, woke up, found she passed away and it affected him deeply."" But an interview that Jackson gave to Barbara Walters weeks after Diana's death could help Jackson lawyers refute Gongaware's claim that no doctor traveled with the singer during the tour. Walters asked Jackson about how he learned the news that his friend, the princess, had died. ""I woke up and my doctor gave me the news, and I fell back down in grief and I started to cry,"" Jackson said. ""That's why the inner pain, the pain in my stomach and in my chest, so I said 'I cannot handle this. It's too much.'"" Promoter grilled about 'smoking gun' e-mail . Jackson's statement that a doctor was at his bedside when he woke up the day of a scheduled ""HIStory"" show in Belgium is not the only evidence he did have a physician on the tour. Dr. Neil Ratner, an anesthesiologist from New York, has acknowledged that he traveled with Jackson during part of the tour. He was at Munich, Germany, in July 1997 when a stage collapsed and Jackson suffered a back injury. It was two months before Diana's death. Dr. Ratner declined to talk about his treatment of Jackson when CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta confronted him outside his Woodstock, New York, home in July 2009, although he did confirm that Jackson had trouble sleeping. ""It's really something I don't want to talk about right now,"" he told Dr. Gupta. A source who was close to Michael Jackson told Gupta in 2009 that when Jackson had trouble sleeping that Dr. Ratner helped ""take him down"" and ""bring him back up."" Ratner, who was convicted of insurance fraud and stripped of his license to practice medicine for three years in 2002, is on the witness list for the trial and has been questioned in a deposition by each side. Debbie Rowe -- Jackson's former wife and the mother of his two oldest children -- will testify that she assisted in administering propofol to Jackson in the 1990s when she was a nurse, AEG Live's Putnam said on the opening day of the trial. AEG exec called Jackson 'freak' before signing concert contract . ""She saw several doctors put Mr. Jackson to sleep in hotel rooms while on tour,"" Putnam said, including in Munich, London, Paris. But Gongaware and others did not know, he said. ""The truth is Mr. Jackson fooled everyone,"" Putnam said about Jackson's propofol use. ""He kept those who might have helped him at a distance and no one knew his deepest, darkest secret."" Jackson's ability to keep his private side private meant AEG executives could not see any red flags warning of Jackson's destruction, Putnam said. ""They didn't see this coming,"" he said. ""They had no idea."" Putnam said Jackson family members -- including Janet and her famous siblings -- will testify about their failed attempts at intervention and their lack of knowledge about what was happening. ""If they didn't know what was going on, how could someone else think there was even a problem,"" he said. But Jackson lawyers will argue that Gongaware, who closely watched expenses on the ""HIStory"" tour because it was losing money at one point, would have noticed spending on hotel rooms and fees for a doctor traveling with the tour.","AEG LIve Co-CEO Paul Gongaware faces more grilling in Michael Jackson death trial .

"(CNN) -- Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said Wednesday that Zimbabwe is in shambles and warned that deaths from starvation and a cholera outbreak threaten to surge with the rainy season approaching. A man carries a relative in a wheelbarrow to a cholera clinic in Harare on Tuesday. Bemoaning Zimbabwe's decline is a familiar refrain for the embattled head of the Movement for Democratic Change. His most recent remarks, however, were backed by former President Carter, who returned from a five-day trip to neighboring South Africa this week and declared Zimbabwe ""a basket case."" Tsvangirai also expressed frustration with attempts to form a unity government between his group and the ruling Zanu-PF party. He said he has asked that South African ex-President Thabo Mbeki recuse himself as mediator between the two parties. The Zimbabwean government quickly countered Tsvangirai's allegations that President Robert Mugabe and Zanu-PF were responsible for the problems gripping the country. ""The government is very committed to ensure that the humanitarian crisis is addressed. It would be wrong for the MDC to blame it on the government,"" Foreign Affairs Minister Simbarashe Mumbengegwi said. Addressing Tsvangirai's allegations that cholera deaths could soon top 50 a day and that the Mugabe-led government seems intent on covering it up, Mumbengegwi noted that Zimbabwe is not the only country where cholera is a problem.  Watch why world leaders call the situation in Zimbabwe shocking » . ""No government would want its people to suffer. Cholera is not peculiar to Zimbabwe,"" he said. ""We hear it is now in South Africa, too, but we cannot relax because of that. We have to fight it as Zimbabweans."" A report in the state-run Herald newspaper Wednesday said the government has kicked off an information campaign to inform citizens of ""the do's and don'ts to combat the disease."" The government is also drilling boreholes to find clean, subterranean water that can be pumped to the surface for drinking and bathing, the Herald reported. The World Health Organization said last week that almost 300 people have died of cholera since August and more than 6,000 cases have been reported. Tsvangirai said Wednesday that conditions would worsen this month as the rainy season brings steamy downpours to much of Zimbabwe, especially the eastern mountain forests. Carter, former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Graca Machel, wife of former South Africa President Nelson Mandela -- all of whom belong to a group of world leaders called the Elders -- had hoped to visit Zimbabwe on their recent trip to the region but were denied visas, according to Tsvangirai and a statement from the Carter Center. ""Mr. Mugabe would prefer that the suffering that he and Zanu-PF have caused, and continue to cause, remains in the dark,"" Tsvangirai said in a statement, adding that because the Movement for Democratic Change and Zanu-PF cannot form a partnership after months of wrangling, ""the MDC must instead work with those Zimbabwean organizations, groups and individuals to address the humanitarian crisis."" The humanitarian problems illustrate the political quagmire in Zimbabwe, where a power-sharing agreement that Mugabe and Tsvangirai signed in September has yet to take effect. Carter issued a statement Tuesday condemning what he said was Harare's decision to renege on an agreement to allow him, Annan and Machel into the country. He also offered a damning assessment of the Mugabe regime. ""After almost three decades of governmental corruption, mismanagement and oppression, Zimbabwe has become a basket case, an embarrassment to the region and a focus of international concern and condemnation,"" he said. Denied passage to Zimbabwe, Carter, Annan and Machel were left to consult with regional leaders -- including Tsvangirai, Botswana President Ian Khama and South Africa President Kgalema Motlanthe -- as well as United Nations officials, nongovernmental organizations and Zimbabwe's civil leaders. ""We had a complete and balanced agenda and more frank discussions than would have been possible in the oppressive and restrained environment of Harare,"" Carter said in his statement. Carter said he learned of conditions in which the official inflation rate has soared to about 231 million percent while thousands of Zimbabweans stand in line for their daily allowance of about 2 cents a day -- from their own bank accounts. The allowance does not afford them a half loaf of bread, he said. Teachers, who earn about a dollar a month, report a student-textbook ratio of about 20-to-1, and school attendance has dropped to about 20 percent in the past three months, the former president reported. The few students still attending classes are generally doing so in the hopes of being fed, he said. ""Meanwhile, top government officials and other privileged people can exchange Zim money at a favorable rate that is several thousand times more than the official rate available to other citizens,"" Carter said. ""They profit greatly from these monetary transactions and shop in special stores."" The nation's four major hospitals have shut down, as roughly 3,500 AIDS victims are dying each week. Unchecked sewage and filthy water have compounded the cholera problem, and Zimbabwe's death rate from the disease is 10 times greater than rates in areas where treatment is available, Carter said. The former president said 19,000 Zimbabweans are fleeing the country each month, mostly to South Africa and Botswana. He estimated that 4 million people have fled the nation. ""The middle class is departing, leaving behind the extremely poor and the small elite group around Mugabe who are profiting from the economic disaster,"" he said. Comparing Zimbabwe to Somalia, a failed African state that has had no functional government since 1991, Carter cast blame on African leaders who fail ""to confront Robert Mugabe and force him to accept the result of the March election and more recently to comply with negotiated political agreements to share governmental authority with Morgan Tsvangirai and the opposition party."" Tsvangirai snared more votes than Mugabe in March's election but not a majority. Tsvangirai dropped out of a subsequent runoff, citing widespread violence against MDC supporters. Carter's call for African leaders to step up pressure on Mugabe came a day before Tsvangirai asked South Africa's Mbeki to bow out as mediator between the MDC and Zanu-PF. ""Sadly, the negotiations have also been hampered by the attitude and position of the facilitator, Mr. Thabo Mbeki. He does not appear to understand how desperate the problem in Zimbabwe is, and the solutions he proposes are too small,"" Tsvangirai said in his statement. ""He is not serving to bring the parties together because he does not understand what needs to be done. In addition, his partisan support of Zanu-PF, to the detriment of genuine dialogue, has made it impossible for the MDC to continue negotiating under his facilitation."" Asked for the Zimbabwe government's reaction to the MDC asking Mbeki to recuse himself, Foreign Minister Mumbengegwi said, ""We have no right to tell them who to complain about. It is their decision in the MDC."" Unless African leaders can find a way to mitigate the political impasse in Zimbabwe, the United Nations or the African Union might need to enter the fray, because, Carter said, ""the poisonous effects"" of the Mugabe regime, including the cholera outbreak, are spilling into other African nations. Food, medicine and monetary donations should be sent immediately to humanitarian agencies such as CARE, World Vision and Save the Children, Carter said, advising that it is unwise to send cash directly to people in Zimbabwe. ""It is counterproductive to contribute money that can be confiscated by the Zimbabwe government,"" he said.","Opposition's Morgan Tsvangirai asks Thabo Mbeki to recuse himself as mediator .

"(CNN) -- The dice have been thrown; over the next couple of months consumers ready to upgrade their phone will be forced into making a decision. Do they go for a phone that is beautifully designed, will make them feel safe, and never for a moment make them feel out of their comfort zone? Or do they take a risk, a risk that sees them fundamentally change the way they use their phone, the way their phone looks, and even what their phone will be able to do? Decisions will have to be made. In the one camp is Apple, in the other is HTC, Samsung, and Nokia. The latter three have all announced Windows Phone 8 devices that are expected at the end of October or the beginning of November. Apple's iPhone 5 went on sale around the world on Friday. While Apple has already confirmed that it has sold 2 million iPhone 5s, and retailers around the globe detail best ever pre-order records, Microsoft is hoping people will wait. It's a tough ask, do you go with the market leading smartphone now, and get what you expect, or wait for another couple of months and hope it has been worth it. Those questions aside, Microsoft with the help of HTC, Nokia, and Samsung, hope you'll wait. If it can convince you to do that, it has a good chance of succeeding. The operating system, not yet fully detailed, looks to have some really nice features above and beyond emailing or making calls. Take the People Hub that seamlessly manages your contacts and your social life, or the in-built Office Hub that makes writing Word documents or managing spreadsheets really easy. There's a kids corner feature too that locks out important features when you give your phone to your kids so they can't email your boss. On the hardware front, Nokia and HTC have both gone for a colorful experience. Windows Phone 8 phones are Flame Red, Limelight Yellow and California Blue. They aren't just Black or White. That is likely to appeal to those that want to be noticed, the cool hipsters and fashionastas, that whether you like it or not, influence how you dress. Nokia, to some outcry, has ditched a Cyan version of its new Lumia handsets. When asked why, it simply replied that Cyan wasn't this year's color. We haven't heard that from a phone company for a long time. Likewise HTC's new 8X and 8S phones have an equally vibrant color scheme that will either appeal or appall. It's about thinking and being different, almost on purpose. Get past the colors, the OS, and the spec sheet is just as cutting edge, untried and untested. Most of the new Windows Phone 8 devices will come with NFC, a new technology that will let you pay with your phone or connect instantly to other NFC devices. Apple has shunned the technology in the new iPhone 5. Microsoft is hoping that's going to be a mistake. Nokia is hoping wireless charging will be a big draw, losing the need for cables all together even in charging and allowing you to just dump your phone on a pillow instead, while HTC has teamed up with Dr Dre's Beats Audio to try and win the battle for your ears. If it is good enough for Olympians, it is good enough for us. Both are pushing the camera at the forefront of the experience. The elephant in the room is still apps. Nokia is doing its best to fill the gaps itself, but with momentum still to kick in, Apple has the upper hand. Windows Phone offers a very viable offering for consumers looking for a change, and business users keen to be secure. Against Apple, Microsoft and its new friends have to convince developers to get building, and convince consumers that there is a point to your phone beyond apps. With such a competitive market that's no easy task. For Microsoft it has a great OS on its side, but the battle is only just starting and they have a long way to go before any of them can claim victory. The question is though, are consumers willing to wait with them, or get their gratification before the race has even begun.","HTC, Samsung, and Nokia have announced Windows Phone 8 devices for October or November .

Nicklaus, who went on to win a record 18 major titles, described Merion's championship East Course as ""Acre for acre, maybe the best test of golf in the world."" Current No. 1 Tiger Woods is another big fan. ""You have to be so disciplined to play that course,"" he said after a recent practice round. So what is it about the Merion which evokes such praise -- and what will await Woods and his rivals when they bid for major glory this week? Thursday's opening round was disrupted by the arrival of predicted bad weather, but there is much more at the Pennsylvania venue to challenge the world's top golfers. CNN's Living Golf has gone behind the scenes at the iconic venue to provide the definitive guide to the magic of Merion and all its charms. Wicker wonders . Foremost among them are the famous red wicker baskets which are positioned above the pin sticks in place of conventional flags -- a peculiarity these days, though more common earlier in the history of golf. They first appeared at Merion in 1915, three years after the course opened in September 1912. The historical origins of the baskets and indeed the reason for them remain unclear, but by the time the 1916 U.S. Amateur Championship was hosted -- the first major event on the course -- they were still in place and have remained ever since. The green staff even have a special machine into which each individual wicker basket flag can be gathered up each night in the ""wicker cart."" When a move to replace ""the wickers"" with standardized flags was mooted, the outcry was loud and clear. But, according to Trevino, they add to the challenge facing the golfers, particularly in breezy conditions. ""Generally when we stand out in the middle of the fairway we can see which way the flag is blowing so we have some idea of how to play the wind,"" he told CNN. ""But with the wicker baskets, no!"" Whoever emerges the winner this Sunday evening will be presented with a wicker basket to commemorate their win along with the championship trophy. One-iron wonder . In 1950, the legendary American golfer Ben Hogan won the U.S. Open at Merion -- just 16 months after suffering terrible injuries in an automobile crash which nearly claimed his life. By a curious twist, and for the only time, the wicker baskets were not used that year. Perhaps they did not want to upset Hogan -- who had the unfair reputation of being a ruthless and aloof winning machine -- on his courageous comeback trail. So when he came to play his second shot to the testing par-four 18th in the final round, he would have seen a flag blowing in the far distance over 200 yards away. Struggling with pain from his still-healing injuries and knowing he needed to find the small green with his shot to have any real chance of joining two other golfers in a playoff, Hogan selected a one-iron club -- which hits the ball far and low if hit correctly. Ever the perfectionist, Hogan's strike was pure perfection and brought gasps from the galleries as it arrowed its way to the heart of the green. Two putts for a par were enough and he won the next day's 18-hole playoff against Lloyd Mangrum and George Fazio. The drama of the moment was captured for posterity by famous Sports Illustrated and Life Magazine photographer Hy Peskin. It is rated one of the best sports photos of the 20th century. That club used by Hogan now resides in the U.S. Golf Association Museum as one of its prized exhibits. Iconic winners . Hogan would be near the top of any list of all-time great golfers, but call it coincidence, the best of the best have filled the honors board at Merion. The 1916 U.S. Amateur was the first tournament for a 14-year-old Bobby Jones. He returned in 1924 to win the event, but his victory in 1930 is best remembered. In the days before the U.S. Masters and PGA Championship, the majors were considered to be the U.S. and British Opens and the British and U.S. Amateur Championships. Jones, the dominant golfer of his era, amateur or professional, arrived at Merion in September 1930 needing to win the U.S. Amateur to complete the set in the same calendar year. In the 36-hole final, played to a matchplay format, he thrashed his unfortunate opponent Eugene Homans, watched by a massive crowd. A reporter labeled the feat as the ""Grand Slam"" -- a term which has stuck. It was to prove Jones' final tournament as he retired from competition aged just 28 to practice law, although he was the driving force behind founding the Masters at Augusta. Olin Dutra won the first U.S. Open to be staged at Merion in 1934, Hogan's 1950 heroics have gone down in golfing folklore, while Nicklaus famously led the United States to victory there in the Eisenhower Trophy (the World Amateur Team Championship) in 1960. His four-round total of 269 is considered one of the greatest displays in the history of the game, but when Nicklaus returned to Merion for the U.S. Open at the peak of his powers in 1971 he found Trevino barring his way to victory. They both tied in 280 level par after four rounds on a course Trevino described as holding ""a lot of trouble and with a lot of tall grass."" Few gave him much chance in the playoff, but with a round of 68 to Nicklaus' 71 he claimed his second U.S. Open and his words ""had beaten the best"" giving him the belief he ""really belonged"" in very elite of golf. David Graham claimed the fourth staging of U.S Open at Merion in 1980 and was in awe of his place in golfing history, becoming the first Australian to win the tournament. ""Bobby Jones won there, Trevino, Hogan won there and then this little kid from Australia comes along and wins,"" he told CNN. Hogan phoned him after his victory and they had lunch. ""He liked international players, he congratulated me on winning. It was cool,"" Graham said. Anyone for cricket . Coming from Australia, Graham would acknowledge that while golf is a popular sport, cricket is a national obsession as it is in England -- the two battling for supremacy for the famous Ashes. When the original Merion club was founded in 1865 -- a playground for the rich society elite of Philadelphia -- the British influence was still strong, so cricket was the chosen sport for the country club setting, while tennis also became popular. In 1896, a golf club was formed from the membership and a course built on existing grounds. The Merion East Course came later -- completed in 1912 and built on land acquired near Ardmore. It was designed by one of the club's members, Scotsman Hugh Wilson -- who had never done such a job before. Scottish roots . He went back home to find inspiration from Scotland's famous coastal links courses, and it was he who introduced the wicker baskets. North Berwick Golf Course, near the border of England, has a strong resemblance to Merion, particularly the 15th and 17th holes. The style of the bunkers is also different from that commonly found in the United States and according to Trevino are devilishly difficult. They are nicknamed the ""white faces of Merion"" and with good reason. ""The Scottish-type bunkers are unbelievable because you think you might be in the bunker, then all of a sudden you're in the lip of it and you can't find your ball, I mean it's hiding in there!"" Trevino told CNN. Trevino believes that despite its short length by modern standards, the combination of the bunkers, small greens and forbidding rough will leave Tiger and co. with a very real test. ""That'll be the toughest little 7,000-yard golf course you'll ever see."" Lunch tee . One of other challenges facing the players will be the unusually close proximity of the dining patio to the first tee. Nerves jangling at the start of an important round, the players can almost hear the tinkle of cutlery and glasses as the members tuck in to some fine cuisine. ""It almost feels like you're teeing off in a carport because the first tee is just outside the door there,"" Trevino said. ""That's the way all the courses used to be. If you go over to Scotland and if you shank a ball out of a bunker, then you'll break the biggest window in the world in a dining room. ""That's the way they built it -- they had a lot of property, they didn't waste it. Now you're building golf courses on 500 acres and nine holes covers five miles!"" Merion, hosting the U.S. Open for the fifth time, takes up a mere 120 acres. All about tradition . As Trevino and others have suggested, it is a course absolutely dripping with traditional influence and none more so than the clubhouse, which was once a farmhouse. Players will use a changing room full of big metal lockers and period features. Photos and old scorecards adorn the walls and there is a massive trophy case -- appropriate for a club which has hosted more USGA events, 18 in all, than any other in the United States. The last was the 2009 Walker Cup amateur competition, where the likes of Rickie Fowler helped the United States to victory over Great Britain and Ireland. Once on the course, players and caddies will have to do without yardage markers, while golf carts are prohibited even for members. Graham has nothing but praise for the work of the club in preserving its culture and heritage. ""They've done such a superb job with their museum, they're very cognizant of the club's tradition and they do what Augusta National does. At all costs they protect the integrity of the club,"" the 67-year-old said. ""Certain (U.S.) Opens, like the one at Pebble Beach, is a little special and certainly the Open at Merion was special, especially for me."" Doubtless, whoever writes their name into the roll of honor under 2012 U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson will take away similar thoughts and join a list of special greats.","Merion is renowned as one of the finest golf courses in the world .

"(CNN) -- Ecuador's government says it has well-founded suspicions that a private security company bugged its London embassy. But Surveillance Group Limited, whose website boasts ties with British law enforcement agencies and European financial institutions, denied that accusation on Thursday. ""We have this morning heard an accusation the source of which is apparently Ricardo Patino, the Ecuadorian foreign minister, suggesting that we have bugged the Ecuadorian Embassy. This is completely untrue,"" Timothy Young, the company's CEO, said in a written statement. ""The Surveillance Group do not and have never been engaged in any activities of this nature. We have not been contacted by any member of the Ecuadorian government, and our first notification was via the press this morning."" Patino told reporters Wednesday that Ecuador had ""founded suspicions"" that the British company was tied to a secret recording device discovered inside an electrical outlet in the ambassador's office last month. But he did not detail what led Ecuadorian authorities to suspect the company's involvement. The foreign minister called for British authorities to help investigate the incident. In addition to serving as an office for Ecuadorian officials abroad, the embassy has also been home for more than a year to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who received asylum from Ecuador in August and risks arrest if he leaves the property. The revelation comes amid worldwide debate over U.S. surveillance, including reports that the National Security Agency planted bugs in diplomatic offices. It also comes as Ecuador plays a key role in the global guessing game over the next steps for Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who is on the run after admitting that he leaked classified documents about U.S. surveillance programs. Snowden has asked for asylum from Ecuador and 20 other countries. Patino said on Wednesday that his country was still evaluating the request. Asked whether Assange's presence inside the Ecuadorian Embassy had opened the building to more risks, Patino acknowledged that the WikiLeaks founder's presence had brought greater attention to the embassy. ""Surely, there are risks, yes ... but we are willing to run them when it comes to defending rights,"" he said.","CEO: Accusations that a company bugged Ecuador's embassy are ""completely untrue""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A convicted rapist seeking to prove his innocence with a new DNA test lost his appeal Thursday at the Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court case involved a crime in which post-conviction DNA testing was available. The justices ruled 5-4 that inmates cannot use a federal civil rights law to press for advanced DNA testing that was unavailable at the time of the crime. Forty-four states and the federal government have laws allowing post-conviction access to biological evidence for such testing, but that number does not include Alaska, where William Osborne was sentenced 15 years ago for a vicious attack on an Anchorage woman. ""He has no constitutional right to obtain post-conviction access to the state's evidence for DNA testing,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. He was supported by his conservative colleagues Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. In dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens said, ""There is no reason to deny access to the evidence and there are many reasons to provide it, not the least of which is a fundamental concern in ensuring that justice has been done in this case."" Justices David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer backed his conclusions. Osborne's trial attorney in Anchorage made a strategic decision 16 years ago to forgo more sophisticated DNA testing of the evidence in the criminal assault case, believing it might end up working against her client. Several years later, the Alaska inmate sought access to the state's biological evidence to have a state-of-the-art DNA test done. Although the court was ruling on the specific facts of Osborne's case, the implications could be felt across the country. The high court refused calls to provide an automatic constitutional right to post-conviction DNA testing for older crimes in which biological evidence is available for such testing. Some states had feared a flood of frivolous lawsuits clogging the courts from prisoners whose guilt has already been established, a fact Roberts noted in his opinion. The Innocence Project, representing Osborne, said DNA testing has exonerated 232 wrongly convicted people in the past two decades. That includes 17 men on death row. Alaska officials told the justices that even if more sophisticated genetic testing did not show the semen and hair at the crime scene matched Osborne, other evidence remains strong enough to uphold the conviction. And they said that since there was no trial error, Osborne should have made his claim of right to access to biological evidence at the trial, not on appeal. Osborne was found guilty in 1993 of kidnapping and assault. He and a co-defendant were convicted of raping an Anchorage prostitute, then beating her with an ax handle, shooting her in the head, and dumping her in a snowbank near the airport, believing she was dead. The victim survived and identified Osborne from photo lineups. He was sentenced to 26 years behind bars, with five years suspended. His co-defendant has continued to implicate Osborne, and the 37-year-old prisoner admitted his guilt in a 2004 parole hearing, although he later said he had made the confession only in the hope it would secure his release. He was not granted parole at that time, but was in 2007. Initial state forensic testing on a condom and hairs found at the crime scene found the DNA consistent with Osborne's genetic profile, but that one in six -- or about 15 percent -- of African-Americans like Osborne might share a similar genetic profile. Osborne's appointed trial counsel declined more sophisticated, independent testing, believing the initial one-in-six ratio represented ""very good numbers"" to make a case for mistaken identity, according to an affidavit submitted in the high court appeal. The trial lawyer was also worried that further testing could work against Osborne. A federal appeals court ruled in favor of Osborne, saying Alaska was trying to ""foreclose"" his possible innocence ""by its simple refusal to open the evidence locker."" Osborne's legal team said that under a section of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, he has a right to such evidence in the government's possession when making a ""free-standing"" claim of innocence. The high court had never before decided what role DNA can play in post-conviction appeals, despite a variety of testing that has been around for more than two decades. Roberts noted that states are ""actively confronting"" how to handle evolving DNA technology and increasing challenges by inmates. ""To suddenly constitutionalize this area would short-circuit what looks to be a prompt and considered legislative response,"" he wrote. He said having courts take over this issue now would be wrong. ""We are reluctant to enlist the federal judiciary in creating a new constitutional code of rules for handling DNA."" The majority found that Alaska's procedures are adequate. But Souter said the state ""has demonstrated a combination of inattentiveness and intransigence in applying those conditions that add up to procedural unfairness that violates the [Constitution's] due process clause."" Within months after Osborne was paroled, he was re-arrested and then convicted of kidnapping and assault in a home invasion in Anchorage. He is awaiting sentencing on those counts. The Supreme Court case is District Attorney's Office for the Third Judicial District v. Osborne (08-6).","Justices: Inmates cannot use federal civil rights law to get advanced DNA testing .

"Washington (CNN) -- Cory Booker already had a national identity before he decided to run for senator. The media-savvy, tweet-happy mayor from Newark -- who easily won the New Jersey Democratic primary for Senate Tuesday -- has been known for his man-of-the-people streak, charismatic presence and social media intensity, or as some say, fixation. Cory Booker becomes Democratic nominee for N.J. Senate seat . But can he make the switch from a nationally popular hands-on mayor to the contentious spotlight of the United States Senate? Booker, in his path to Tuesday's win, weathered a few negative headlines, but came out largely unscathed by his Democratic opponents. His Republican challenger, former Bogota Mayor Steve Lonegan, may be able to go after Booker for spending more time on his national profile than on running the city he leads. But several polls show Booker running away with the special election on October 16 and becoming the first African-American elected to the Senate since Barack Obama. Despite the possible attacks, experts in New Jersey politics and friends close to Booker tell CNN that there is little chance the mayor's national profile will diminish if he heads to the Senate later this year. ""I wouldn't expect those media requests are going to abate because he moved into a new role,"" said Andra Gillespie, a friend of Booker's and the author of ""The New Black Politician: Cory Booker, Newark, and Post-Racial America."" But is that a good thing? Booker shoots down 2016 presidential bid . Elizabeth Warren or John Edwards? When Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was elected to the Senate in 2012, she came in as someone with substantial liberal chops and national notoriety for her expertise on banking and consumer rights issues. After arriving in the Senate, however, Warren shied away from national media attention and is no longer a regular on the interview circuit. That likely won't be the case with Booker. ""The difference between him and Elizabeth Warren (is), he has already mastered social media and mainstream media in a way that she hasn't,"" Gillespie said. In six years as Newark's mayor, Booker gained notoriety for an experiential kind of leadership. Late last year, the mayor lived on food stamps in order to show how difficult relying on the government program can be. From 1998 to 2006, Booker lived in a housing project as a way to connect with constituents. These stories -- along with others -- have made Booker a household name in New Jersey and national politics. On Twitter, the mayor has a massive 1.4 million followers and has sent more than 30,000 tweets in his time on the site. It isn't unusual to see Booker direct message constituents who tweet him with issues -- in fact, it has become part of his persona. And that might be a problem for Booker. As a possible preview to attacks that could be leveled against the mayor in the future, Republicans have questioned how Booker could rise so high nationally from such an unusual perch. ""There is something decidedly odd about the whole Cory Booker phenomenon,"" wrote Stuart Stevens, a Republican strategist, in a Daily Beast opinion piece. ""Someone who managed to become a national political figure as mayor of the nation's 67th-largest city, he is dangerously close to falling into the celebrity trap of being famous for being famous."" That idea -- that Booker is famous for being famous -- has begun to circle at home, too. ""The phrase that everyone has been throwing around here is workhorse vs. showhorse,"" said John Weingart, associate director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. ""I think he certainly has a unique path to political prominence,"" Weingart said. ""People used to say being mayor of New York was a dead end job politically, but nobody ever said being mayor of Newark was a path to higher office. He has certainly had some accomplishment as mayor of Newark, but it is almost (that) his fame is on a separate track as his record from Newark."" In particular, Weingart notes, Booker is regularly in front of the camera on national news, but rarely to talk about Newark. Instead, he said, he is booked because of his charisma and ability to talk about Democratic politics, in general. Gillespie thinks those critiques are somewhat unfair. Instead of comparing him to the media-shy Warren, the Booker chronicler said the more apt comparison is with former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina. When Edwards was elected to the Senate in 1998, the North Carolinian was known as the charismatic lawyer who gained national attention for protecting patients' rights against doctors and hospitals in a 1985 case. When he got to the Senate, he became a party standout and was the champion of an issue that put him in front of cameras with some regularity: tort reform. If Booker can find an issue, Gillespie said, the comparison with Edwards -- who ran for president in 2004 and 2008 -- could stick. How far can Booker go? Even when Booker was a Newark City Council member, people who came into contact with him said they could see him running for president someday. ""Having known him for a long time, people were talking about him being the first black president in 2001 and 2002,"" Gillespie said. ""It is looking more plausible now."" Weingart shared a similar story. Cost to win congressional election skyrockets . ""I think a small number of political figures who from the beginning of their career, lead people to say I can imagine him becoming president,"" Weingart said. ""It has been true of Cory Booker."" Earlier this month, Booker ruled out the possibility of running for president in 2016. Asked by Politico whether he would rule out a presidential or vice presidential bid in the next election cycle, Booker responded with three words: ""Absolutely yes, unequivocally."" But that doesn't mean never. And with the Democrats' markedly short bench on future presidential candidates, along with Booker's ability to command national attention and hefty amounts of fundraising dollars, the possibility is clearly there. With those attributes comes another, more grandiose comparison, with President Barack Obama. Supporters, such as Gillespie, said the comparisons have to do with a mix of race, charisma and electoral history. And, of course, possible presidential aspirations. But it is in that last regard that Gillespie looked to distance Booker from Obama. ""If Booker were to run in 2020, he would have served a full term as U.S. senator,"" she said, ""which would be different than President Obama."" Last month, the two sides of Booker -- the political rising star and the national media figure -- came into conflict when a scheduling snafu for a speaking gig at the University of Iowa, the state that traditionally hosts the first caucus of the presidential election season, put his possible White House aspirations into focus. All part of the game, says Weingart. ""I think Booker will have to face that,"" he said, referring to the mayor being asked about running for president ""If he goes to Iowa, that will be looked at through the lens."" ""The Democrats don't have a deep bench, so I think every conversation about the future of the party that extends past Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, he will be on the list.""","Newark Mayor Cory Booker won the Dem. primary for the Senate seat from N.J.

"(CNN) -- An announcement on Tuesday marked, quite literally, a watershed moment in the history of solar system exploration. NASA scientists said an analysis of drilled rock samples collected by the Curiosity rover shows that ancient Mars could have supported living microbes. It is the first time that we've discovered actual evidence for fresh water on another planet. We've been down this watery path before -- sort of. Back in 2004, NASA's Opportunity rover found evidence of ancient water on Mars. For a place to be habitable by life as we know it, it has to have liquid water, heat sources like volcanoes or impact craters, and carbon-bearing organic molecules. NASA: Yes, Mars could have hosted life . Mars had abundant volcanoes and impacts early on, and Opportunity rover scientists finally found smoking gun evidence for the ancient liquid water. What that rover couldn't tell us was whether Mars had organic molecules. But organic molecules get delivered to planets all the time from impacts by small and large asteroids and comets (like February's fireball impact above Chelyabinsk, Russia), providing the last key ingredient for habitability. That argument sealed the deal back in 2004: Mars was habitable. Cool! But the evidence we found in the rocks back then prescribed a very specific kind of habitable environment, and one that many biologists think is quite rare and special. The rocks contained abundant sulfur minerals, implying that the water in which they formed contained sulfuric acid. On Earth there are micro-organisms that can live, and even thrive, in acidic water, even battery acid. But these are rare and specialized niche organisms, what biologists call ""extremophiles,"" because they love extreme environmental conditions. Still, extreme conditions or not, it meant that Mars could have been habitable for some forms of life. Now fast-forward to 2013, where in the past few weeks the Curiosity rover has been drilling into some different rocks half a planet away, inside a deep basin formed by the Gale impact crater. Armed with more sophisticated analysis tools than earlier rover teams, Curiosity scientists have been able to conclusively find the first on-the-ground evidence for the presence of abundant clay minerals within those drilled rocks. Clays are water-loving materials (just ask any friends who make pottery), sometimes forming from the interaction of water and different kinds of precursor volcanic rocks, and holding much of that water within their mineral structures. But here's the catch: Clay minerals are easily dissolved in acidic water. Because they are preserved in the Gale crater still today, it implies that the water there had relatively little acidity -- that is, it was fresh water, like the water you'd find in most ponds or lakes on Earth today. Indeed, there's geologic evidence from the rover and from NASA's Mars orbiters that there may once have been a large lake and streams within the basin that Curiosity is driving around in now. And there's more to be excited about. Micro-organisms on Earth are much more common in fresh water than acidic water, and so rather than Mars just having been a potential haven for some extreme forms of life, Curiosity's discovery means that Mars had -- and still preserves evidence of -- environments that were habitable for an enormous variety of micro-organisms that thrive on our own planet. It seems as though NASA or other space agencies ""rediscover"" water on Mars every few years, so maybe this latest announcement will be regarded as just more of the same. But this time it's different -- really! The stakes have just been raised a notch: Not only is there another planet right next door in our own solar system that had habitable environments on its surface long ago, but there appear to have been common and recognizable -- perhaps even Earthlike -- environments on Mars. That's the big news coming out of this latest discovery from NASA's Mars rovers. Curiosity is only about a quarter of the way through its primary mission, so there's lots of time to search for more watery evidence, as well as for any elusive associated organic molecules, which have yet to be found. Because of abundant solar ultraviolet radiation at the surface, organic molecules might not be preserved as well as clay minerals. But Curiosity has the tools, and the brainpower back here on Earth, to find out. The implications of discovering evidence for fresh water are exciting for macro-organisms as well: Rover chief scientist John Grotzinger of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has speculated that we would have been able to drink that ancient water, had we been there some 2, 3, or 4 billion years ago to witness glorious Lake Gale. Imagine that. Let's go back in time -- how would you like your water? Sparkling, fresh, or Martian? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jim Bell.","NASA announced on Tuesday that ancient Mars could have supported living microbes .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are preparing to resume long-stalled direct talks on Wednesday, but news of Israeli plans for more than 1,000 new settlement units on disputed territory has cast their success into doubt. The two sides agreed to return to the negotiating table following intense diplomatic efforts by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on a visit to the region last month. But the news that Israeli authorities have given preliminary approval for new settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem -- considered illegal under international law -- has angered senior Palestinian figures and prompted condemnation from Israel's Western allies. Mark Regev, an Israeli government spokesman, told CNN that the announcement was a ""preliminary procedure decision"" and that additional decisions would be needed before any construction could start. The issue of Israeli settlement-building in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem derailed the last round of direct talks in 2010. Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesman for the Palestinian presidency, told the official WAFA news agency that Israel's latest settlement plan ""aims at obstructing the peace efforts."" Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, deplored the failure of the international community to hold Israel accountable for its actions. ""I think this whole series of settlement expansion, land confiscation will turn any peace initiative into a mockery, any negotiations become a travesty -- there is no possibility of peace with such actions and plans,"" she said. ""Israel is destroying the negotiations, Israel is destroying any chances of peace, and Israel should be made to bear responsibility for this."" 'Undermine trust' UK Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt called on the Israeli authorities Saturday to reverse its decision to advance plans for 1,096 settlement units in the West Bank and approve dozens of new units in East Jerusalem. ""Israeli settlements are illegal under international law, undermine trust and threaten the viability of the two-state solution,"" he said. ""We urge both parties to continue to show the bold and decisive leadership needed for these efforts to succeed, and to avoid steps that undermine negotiations."" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Thursday that the United States had been in touch with the Israeli government over the decision and was making its concerns known. ""Our position on settlements has not changed. We do not accept the legitimacy of continued settlement activity and oppose any efforts to legitimize settlement outposts,"" she said. Psaki said she had no indication that the Israeli announcement would impact on the negotiations. Kerry, she added, ""has made clear that he believes both of the negotiating teams are at the table in good faith and are committed to working together to make progress."" Israel also approved the construction of a 69-unit settlement in East Jerusalem -- which Palestinians consider to be the capital of their future state -- just before Kerry's visit last month. Palestinian chief peace negotiator Saeb Erekat said then that the world must act to stop Israel building more settlements. Letting its government get away with it, he said, takes away any motivation for Israel to work toward peace. The European Union angered Israeli leaders last month when it issued a directive that no EU funding or grants can go to Israeli settlements outside Israel's pre-1967 borders. In January, the United Nations Human Rights Council said Israeli settlements amount to ""creeping annexation"" of Palestinian territories by Israel and have taken a ""heavy toll"" on the rights and sovereignty of Palestinians. CNN's Kareem Khadder reported from Jerusalem and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","Israeli and Palestinian negotiators scheduled to meet for peace talks .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A nurse who administered propofol to Michael Jackson more than a dozen times said the pop star did not appear to be a drug-seeker. David Fournier was called as a witness Thursday by AEG Live in an effort to convince jurors that Jackson was so deceptive and secretive about his drug use that its executives had no way of knowing his health was in danger as he prepared for his comeback concerts. An economist hired by the concert promoter's lawyers will testify Friday in an effort to downplay how much money Jackson might have earned had he not died at age 50 -- an important issue if the jury decides AEG Live is liable in his death. Michael Jackson's mother and three children contend the company negligently hired, retained or supervised the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter in his death -- which the coroner ruled was caused by an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol. AEG Live argues that Jackson chose and controlled Dr. Conrad Murray, who told investigators he gave Jackson nightly infusions of propofol to treat his insomnia. Fournier, a certified nurse anesthetist, testified about an incident on June 3, 2003 in which Jackson stopped breathing while under sedation for a procedure with Beverly Hills dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein. After Jackson suffered a ""somewhat bizarre reaction"" during the sedation, Klein told Fournier it might be because the singer had an ""opioid antagonist"" implant. It was intended to help treat a dependence on Demerol, he said. ""You expect your clients and doctors be honest with you and I felt ambushed and was upset,"" Fournier testified. The nurse said it made him angry at both Klein and Jackson. AEG Live lawyers hope jurors see the incident as evidence that Jackson was dishonest about his drug use, which would support their contention that their executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments he was getting from Murray. Fournier also testified that Jackson failed to follow his instructions in two instances after being sedated for procedures. Jackson went to a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant for a bucket of chicken instead of going home and eating crackers, he testified. Another time he went to a rehearsal for a Grammy show performance and sprained his ankle, he said. Every instance where Jackson was given propofol was medically justified, Fournier said. The 14 times he administered it between 2000 and 2003 involved plastic surgeries, dermatological procedures and oral surgeries, he said. He first sedated Jackson in 1993 when he was being treated for serious scalp burns suffered while filming a Pepsi commercial several years earlier, he said. Some of the 25 times he was hired to assist with Jackson's procedures no drugs were given, he said. He would just hold his hand and assure him it would be all right. Jackson never asked for specific drugs and never quarreled with him, he said. All of the doctors who treated him were respected physicians, he said. Fournier's friendly relationship with Jackson ended in November 2003 when he canceled a procedure because Jackson was ""a little goofy, a little slow to respond."" Fournier said he refused to sedate Jackson because he suspected he was lying to him about his use of drugs. ""Despite 10 years of good quality care and taking good care of him for a long period of time, he never called me,"" he said. AEG Live's lead lawyer has said he would call as witnesses ""many, many, doctors"" who have treated Jackson to make their case that he was a secretive drug addict. The trial in a Los Angeles court concludes its 13th week Friday and is expected to last into September.","Nurse David Fournier gave Jackson propofol 14 times in 3 years .

"(CNN) -- A woman in Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey, came forward as part of a group of 16 that won a piece of the $448 million jackpot from Wednesday's Powerball lottery drawing. Susan Nichel told CNN affiliate WPVI in Philadelphia on Friday that she was part of a group in the Ocean County vehicle maintenance facility in Toms River that pooled their money together to buy a ticket. ""I'm still up in the clouds. I can't even tell you. I'm so excited. My coworker Elaine came out and shook me and said 'We did win,'"" Nichel said. The group's lottery ticket was worth $86 million, but between federal and state taxes and splitting the sum among the group, each contributor will received about $3.5 million, according to WPVI. There were three winning tickets sold in this mega Powerball drawing. An electrical engineer in Minnesota came forward on Thursday to claim his one-third stake. The other two tickets were sold in New Jersey, one at a Super Stop n Shop in South Brunswick and the other at an Acme Market in Little Egg Harbor, according to Carole Hedinger, the executive director of the New Jersey Lottery. Why you keep playing the lottery . The holder of the third lottery ticket has yet to come forward. On Friday, CNN spoke with another member of the group of 16 maintenance workers. The man, 59, did not wish to be identified. ""We're just trying to keep it normal, stay relatively calm. Keeping it real as they say,"" he said. Sixty people work at the Toms River facility, though only 16 decided to pool their money together. The all-time largest U.S. jackpot was $656 million in the Mega Millions game in March 2012. That was split among three tickets sold in Illinois, Kansas and Maryland. Powerball is played in 43 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

"(CNN) -- During the White House Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday night, Jimmy Kimmel made a joke that President Obama laughed at, but that you could see was just killing him inside. ""Mr. President, do you remember when the country rallied around you in hopes of a better tomorrow?"" Kimmel asked. ""That was hilarious. That was your best one yet."" Yeah it was. I'm sure he still has a lot of hope. But I would dare to say the thing that changed most over these past three years is Obama. The unbridled optimism that his first campaign once embodied has been bludgeoned by dogmatism, pragmatism and bipartisan cronyism. Hope and change are tough when the worst economy in 80 years is waiting to greet you at the door. Hope and change are challenging when Rush Limbaugh, the unofficial gatekeeper of the conservative movement, tells his troops ""I hope Obama fails"" before your first day on the job. Hope and change are virtually impossible when working with a Congress so dysfunctional that its approval rating never reached 25% in all of 2011 and was as low as 10% in February. No wonder his hair is a bit grayer these days. And no wonder the new Obama slogan is ""Forward."" ""Hope and Change"" captured the heart of a people who believed one man could change the culture of Washington. ""Forward"" acknowledges things are not where he said they would be, but takes ownership of a record that shows he at least has us pointed in the right direction: 12 consecutive months of job losses before he took office, 25 consecutive months and counting of job growth since 2010. It's not as sexy, but at least it's honest. After all, Guantanamo Bay is still open. Unemployment is still above 8%. Housing prices are still low. This is why probably why Mitt Romney felt comfortable enough to send out this tweet: ""The promises that candidate Obama made are very different than what President Obama delivered."" Embedded in the tweet was a video, showing Obama in 2008 promising to go through the federal budget line by line to cut fat, and then fast forwarding to today with stats about the growing debt and the nearly $1 million wasted on the now infamous GSA conference. Had another challenger posted the ad, it would have landed a solid right hook to Obama's re-election bid. But it was Romney, so it was more like a boomerang -- an aggressive attack sent out but ultimately coming back to its sender. The last person who should want to start a video rewind contest is Romney, who has enough flip-flops and broken promises captured on film that he could start his own network. Nonetheless, while the messenger is a bit shaky, the overall message is not. Obama has indeed fallen short on quite a few of the promises he's made over the years. And the campaign slogan ""Forward"" reflects those shortcomings and challenges: obstructionist Republicans determined to bring him down, self-serving Democrats too scared to pass a budget, and a public so dense that at one point it thought Donald Trump would make a good president. But at the end of the day, Obama has only himself to blame for the malaise of disappointment that has draped much of his presidency. A disappointment, mind you, that has less to do with his actual policy than with his inability to reach the ridiculously high bar he set for himself over the years. Tweets like Romney's are not necessarily fair -- after all, nothing happens in a vacuum -- but Obama was the one who made all of the promises. He was the one who set the standard. He is the one sitting in his own prison. I doubt he'll ever say it, but I bet if he had a chance to do it all over again, he would underbid rather than overbid his hand. Romney will continue to hammer away at what Obama hasn't done -- and he should -- if for no other reason than hoping to distract voters from seeing all of the things Obama has accomplished. Like preventing insurance companies from denying people with pre-existing conditions, courtesy of the flawed but helpful Affordable Care Act; overturning ""don't ask, don't tell;"" appointing two women to the Supreme Court. Getting Osama bin Laden. That was one of candidate Obama's promises, you know. In 2007 he said he would get bin Laden, even if it meant going into Pakistan. This week marks the one-year anniversary of President Obama delivering on that promise. Funny, for some reason that clip didn't make it into Romney's ad. I'm sure it was an oversight.

"(CNN) -- I have smoked pot. Not today or this week, or even this month, but I have. I'm telling you this because before I begin talking about the pot-smoking habits of others, I thought it would only be right that I first owned up to my own past use. Maybe this will encourage others to be a bit more honest because, like it or not, admitting to smoking pot is bound to get a lot less scandalous. Three states -- Colorado, Washington and Oregon -- have marijuana legalization proposals on the ballot, and it won't be surprising if at least one of them passes. Not medical marijuana, mind you, but the regulation and selling of small quantities for recreational use. If you thought Nirvana and Pearl Jam put Seattle on the map, legal marijuana will make it out of this world. And I promise that will be my last pot joke, although being silly about pot illustrates why it's taken this long for the country to begin adult conversations about marijuana, and not just knee-jerk rhetoric based on fear instead of facts. When President Nixon signed the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, officially starting the so-called war on drugs, it was largely in response to pot-smoking hippies and Vietnam vets coming home addicted to heroin. Nixon budgeted $100 million to fight what he called public enemy No. 1 -- illegal drugs. In 2010, it was $15 billion. A trillion dollars has been spent on the war on drugs since it began. Two government reports released last year had difficulty proving the billions being spent are making a big difference. In 1970, the federal government listed pot to be more harmful than cocaine and meth. We now know that isn't true. That's not to say legalizing pot is without risks; it has been shown to impair concentration. But one study found alcohol was by far the most dangerous drug, followed by heroin and crack. Weed rated far down the list. So why do we continue to allow the Nixon administration's hatred of hippies to influence what we think about drug usage today? I don't know how much or how little tax revenue is actually going to come from state-sanctioned pot, but to me that's not the point. The issue isn't how much money the government can make from pot sales, but rather, are the reasons why pot was originally classified as illegal still valid today? Now that we have studies that debunk the myth of longtime impairment from using pot, now that we see how ineffective the government has been in keeping pot off the streets, now that we have seen the gangland violence of drug cartels, should we still be looking at marijuana the way we did 40 years ago? In the 1928 presidential election, Herbert Hoover crushed his opponent, Al Smith, winning 40 states, in part because Smith was demonized as ""the cocktail president."" Smith was in favor of repealing the 18th Amendment -- Prohibition -- while Hoover believed he must enforce the law. It's hard to imagine today, but alcohol was so vilified then there was an actual Prohibition Party dedicated to keeping it illegal. Members even endorsed their own candidate for president. Yet, just five years after that election, alcohol was legal. And even though Hoover lost his bid for re-election, he did so supporting the repeal. That's how quickly things can change. And that bit of history is what makes the results of these three states so fascinating. No one expects President Obama or Mitt Romney to come out in support of legalized marijuana within the next few days, but what will the conversation be like four years from now? If the nation can go from upholding Prohibition to ""drink up"" in an election cycle, why couldn't 2016 feature the first pro-pot president? Especially if next week's results are, shall we say, favorable? Voting for a candidate solely because he or she lets you light up is stupid, but if all other things are equal, are we ready to vote to legalize marijuana the way our grandparents voted to legalize alcohol? I think we are, but then one could say I'm a bit biased.

"(CNN) -- Colorado theater shooting suspect James Holmes will wear a hidden harness under his clothes to restrain him during his trial, which will have the largest jury pool in state history. Holmes is accused of killing 12 people and wounding dozens more in an Aurora movie theater. He will wear the harness, which will be anchored to the floor, because of the violent nature of his alleged crimes, a judge said. Judge Carlos Samour Jr. will send out 5,000 jury summons and expects at least 3,200 people will end up in court, he ruled on Thursday. That would mean each of the 450,000 Arapahoe County residents eligible for jury duty would have a 1 in 90 chance of being called, for this one case alone, court spokesman Rob McCallum told CNN. The idea is to bring in 800 prospective jurors at a time on Thursdays and Fridays early next year, a process that McCallum says could take three to four weeks. Those thousands will be winnowed down to 12 men and women for the start of the trial, which is set to begin February 3. It is expected to last four months. Judge accepts theater shooting suspect's insanity plea . Asking more people than usual to come to court for high-profile cases is common in the U.S. justice system, given concerns many of them already know the story and have strong opinions about it. In Florida, for example, there was a 500-person jury pool for the now-ongoing murder trial of George Zimmerman, who is accused in the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin -- a case that drew national headlines for weeks. So too, of course, did what happened just after midnight the night of July 20, 2012, in the Denver suburb of Aurora. It was then and there, authorities say, that a man walked through an exit door into a crowded Theater 9 of the Century movie complex as a late-night premiere of the Batman sequel ""The Dark Knight Rises"" played. The former neuroscience graduate student wore all-black, a ballistic helmet, a tactical ballistic vest, protective leggings, a throat and groin protector, and a gas mask, police say. And he carried an arsenal that included two Glock handguns, an AR-15 rifle, a shotgun and 6,295 rounds of ammunition, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent Steve Beggs has testified. ""He didn't care who he killed,"" prosecutor Karen Pearson told a judge during a preliminary court hearing in January, adding Holmes chose his venue carefully to cage his victims. ""He intended to kill them all."" After the carnage and Holmes' subsequent capture outside the theater, he was charged with 166 counts of murder, attempted murder and weapons violations. Rescue workers weren't prepared for chaos of Aurora shooting . Since his arrest, much of the in-court discussion has resolved around Holmes' mental state. Judge Samour earlier this month accepted the defense's plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. He was then taken to the Colorado Mental Health Institute in Pueblo for evaluation, and is expected to be back in Arapahoe County Jail on August 2. Prosecutors in Arapahoe County announced in April they would seek the death penalty. Despite the notoriety of the mass shooting, the judge ruled Thursday that the empaneled jury will not be sequestered, as Holmes' defense team requested. Making it so they couldn't go home throughout the prolonged trial, Samour said, was an ""unnecessarily drastic, expensive and impractical remedy that ... will create an extreme and undue hardship for jurors."" The judge also ruled against the defense's attempt to prevent jurors from using phones or computers, barring their use in court but saying preventing them from using them outside is ""unreasonable and unfair."" One thing jurors won't be able to see is restraints on Holmes. As someone accused of ""multiple violent crimes,"" Samour says that Holmes must be restrained carefully during his trial. But the judge said he needn't wear handcuffs or shackles. Instead, the judge ruled, Holmes will ""wear a harness under his clothing which will not be visible to the jury"" and will be anchored to the floor.

"(CNN) -- A former Colombian model wanted on drug trafficking charges was captured Wednesday in Argentina, a spokesman for the Argentina Airport Security Police said. Angela Sanclemente, 30, was picked up the K-Lodges Hostel in Buenos Aires' Palermo neighborhood, police spokesman Maximiliano Lencina told reporters Wednesday afternoon. Lencina said Sanclemente was registered at the hostel -- popular with foreign university students -- under the name ""Annie"" and had told people at the hostel she was from Mexico. She had dyed her brown hair to blonde and was alone in the hostel when detained. Lencina said Sanclemente has been in touch with her lawyer and will be questioned on Thursday by an Argentine federal judge. She will be transported Wednesday afternoon from the hostel to Airport Security Police offices at the Ezeiza International Airport, he said. Interpol issued an international arrest warrant for Sanclemente in March. Investigators at the time said they believed she might be in Argentina, where authorities suspected she may be the ""queen-pin"" of an international operation that uses models as drug mules to move suitcases loaded with cocaine out of the Buenos Aires airport. ""We believe she played an important role in the drug trafficking organization,"" said Lencina. Argentine authorities had already detained several alleged members of the trafficking gang, and sources told CNN that some of those arrested named Sanclemente and her Argentine male model boyfriend -- now in custody -- as ringleaders. In Facebook messages posted earlier this year, Sanclemente maintained her innocence. ""I'm very sad and hurt by the bad information. I don't know how the press can destroy an innocent person,"" she wrote. ""I don't want to go to jail. I don't deserve it. I am innocent."" Sanclemente's mother, Yaneth Valencia, arrived at the hostel, where she was denied permisssion to see her daughter. She told reporters outside the hostel that ""there is a plot against her."" ""They are using my daughter,"" she said, without specifiying who she meant. ""My daughter is innocent."" She told the reporters that she would be ""happy to give you an interview in a studio,"" but would charge them, ""because I need the money to help my daughter."" Sanclemente first hit the headlines in 2000 when she was 20. She won Colombia's prestigious Queen of Coffee beauty pageant. Victory was short-lived. Judges dethroned her after two days when they found she had been married, contrary to competition rules. That marriage -- to a Barranquilla, Colombia, businessman -- lasted three months in 1998. He paid for her to study journalism at Barranquilla's university. A university friend, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals, said Sanclemente dropped out of college after three semesters and spent tuition fees on silicone breast implants instead. That friend said Sanclemente idolized Colombia's then-top model Natalia Paris. She dyed her hair blond and imitated Paris' distinctive accent to appear more like her. Paris married a drug trafficker turned DEA informant, known as Julio Correa. He was killed in 2001 by his former associates when he returned to Colombia from Miami, Florida. Drug underworld sources said he was cut up in a meat grinder. Sanclemente left Colombia around 2005 and headed to Mexico, where she continued to pick up modeling assignments and bit-part roles as a TV actress, according to friends.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama's plan to review U.S. surveillance programs has validated fugitive NSA leaker Edward Snowden's role as a whistle-blower, the head of the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks said Saturday. The statement came a day after Obama outlined steps to reform intelligence gathering measures, saying the classified leaks by Snowden created a public distrust in programs meant to safeguard Americans. ""As Snowden has stated, his biggest concern was if he blew the whistle and change did not occur,"" Julian Assange said in a written statement. ""Well, reforms are taking shape, and for that, the president and people of the United States and around the world owe Edward Snowden a debt of gratitude."" Obama has refused any characterization of Snowden as a ""whistle-blower"" or ""patriot,"" telling reporters there were ""other avenues"" the former National Security Agency contractor could have taken instead of leaking national security surveillance information. The president said Snowden's leaks came in ""dribs and drabs,"" giving a false general impression that ""we are somehow out there willy-nilly sucking information from everybody."" At the same time, Obama sought to assure the public that there are safeguards in place, while acknowledging the need for transparency. Among the steps being taken, according to the president: Working with Congress to pursue appropriate improvements of the telephone data program; reforming the secret court that approves that initiative; improving transparency to provide as much information as possible to the public, including the legal rationale for government collection activities; and appointing a high-level, independent group of outside experts to review surveillance technologies. Snowden stepped forward publicly in June to claim responsibility for leaking to the media that the NSA had secretly collected and stored millions of phone records from accounts in the United States. The agency also collected information from U.S. companies on the Internet activity of overseas residents, he said. Snowden fled first to China and then to Russia before Moscow granted him temporary asylum despite pressure from the Obama administration to return him to the United States to face charges. He has been charged with three felony counts, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act, for the leaks. If Snowden believes his actions were right, ""he can appear before a court with a lawyer and make his case,"" the president said. Snowden and others have contended that he did America and the world a service by revealing information on secret programs, which they say wrongly impinge on people's right to privacy in furtively giving too much information to the U.S. government. ""The simple fact is that without Snowden's disclosures, no one would know about the programs and no reforms could take place,"" Assange said. Assange released the statement from Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he sought refuge to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning over alleged sex crimes. CNN's Jessica Yellin contributed to this report.","Julian Assange says the world owes Edward Snowden a debt of gratitude .

"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- Venezuela's Supreme Court has upheld the country's presidential election results, ruling Wednesday against the opposition candidate's challenge. The court also rejected a claim disputing President Nicolas Maduro's Venezuelan citizenship -- ending one avenue members of the opposition had pursued to challenge the legitimacy of his presidency. After the closely watched April election to pick Hugo Chavez's successor, officials said Maduro won 51% of the vote. Maduro, Chavez's political heir, was sworn in as president at an April 19 inauguration ceremony. Opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski had argued that the results were illegitimate and called for new elections. In May, the opposition filed a lawsuit contesting the election, presenting what it said was a long list of election irregularities that totaled more than 180 pages. Maduro has stressed that he won a clear majority of votes in the election and accused Capriles and his supporters of inciting violence. At a press conference Wednesday, Supreme Court President Gladys Gutierrez said that all the lawsuits filed challenging the election were invalid because they did not present enough proof or documentation, Venezuela's information ministry said in a statement. In another push to challenge Maduro's presidency, some in the opposition have resorted to a tactic familiar to Americans: questioning the birthplace of the president. In the Venezuelan version of the ""birther"" movement, its proponents say Maduro was born in neighboring Colombia and is either a Colombian citizen or a dual citizen, either of which would make him ineligible to be president. The leaders of the movement took their complaint to Venezuela's Supreme Court, to Colombian authorities and even to the European Union. Maduro's supporters ignore the question as nonsense, and Maduro has repeatedly said he was born in Caracas. No birth certificate has been produced for Maduro.

"(CNN) -- The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Friday that same-sex marriages can resume in California, a move that the Supreme Court paved the way for on Wednesday. Three judges on the appeals court made it possible for local governments to issue marriage certificates for gay and lesbian couples with a few words: ""The stay in the above matter is dissolved effective immediately."" Very soon after, cheers erupted and camera flashes flickered as Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier obtained a marriage license and wed at San Francisco's city hall. The two were one of the couples who sued to stop a voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage from taking effect. ""This is a profound day for our country, and it's just the right thing,"" said California Attorney General Kamala Harris, shortly before presiding over Perry's and Stier's wedding ceremony. ""Justice is finally being served."" California's Supreme Court struck down the state's ban on same-sex marriage in May 2008, ruling that the state's constitution gives ""this basic civil right to (marry to) all Californians, whether gay or heterosexual, and to same-sex couples as well as to opposite-sex couples."" But months later, 52% of voters backed Proposition 8 to once again restrict marriages so that they can only be between a man and a woman. The measure put gay and lesbian marriages on hold in the state, though lawsuits followed. State officials declined to stand behind Proposition 8 -- and, thus, its prohibition on gay marriage -- though private parties did step in and offer to do so. A federal appeals court later ruled that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional, though it still issued a stay on same-sex marriages until the U.S. Supreme Court could weigh in. That happened in a 5-4 decision Wednesday, when the high court dismissed an appeal of that federal court ruling on jurisdictional grounds. That meant Friday's news -- the resumption of same-sex marriages in the Golden State -- was expected, even though no one knew when it would happen. The Supreme Court ruled that the private parties backing Proposition 8 did not have ""standing"" to defend the ballot measure. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion, joined by fellow conservative Justice Antonin Scalia and more liberal Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan. ""We have never before upheld the standing of a private party to defend a state statute when state officials have chosen not to,"" wrote Roberts. This decision was cheered by gay marriage supporters in California, though it skirted the larger issue of whether same-sex marriage is a constitutional ""equal protection"" right that should apply to all states. So, too, did another landmark ruling that same day on United States v. Windsor: It struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act and found that the federal government must recognize legal same-sex marriages, though it did not compel them to be legalized in the 37 states where they currently are not. Supreme Court cases rest of citizens who sued, made history . Still, both decisions were resoundingly cheered by gay rights supporters. Many who believe marriage should only be between a man and a woman, however, were disappointed. And that held to form on Friday as well, after the 9th Circuit's ruling allowing same-sex marriages in California. ""This outrageous act tops off a chronic pattern of lawlessness, throughout this case, by judges and politicians hell-bent on thwarting the vote of the people to redefine marriage by any means, even outright corruption,"" the Proposition Legal Defense Fund said in a statement. ""...If our opponents rejoice in achieving their goal in a dishonorable fashion, they should be ashamed.""

"(CNN) -- A Malian presidential candidate conceded to his opponent Monday, a day after a runoff election in the nation rattled in the past year by a coup and insurgent Islamists. Former Finance Minister Soumaila Cisse conceded to former Prime Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita on social media. ""My family & myself went to Mr. Keita, the future president of Mali, congratulate him on his victory. God bless you,"" he said on Twitter. On his official Facebook page, Cisse issued a statement: . ""Dear citizens, dear friends: . To those who have been following me and supporting me here on this page for so many months, I would like to tell you that my family and I went tonight at Mr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, who will be our next President of the Republic to congratulate him on his victory in the presidential election."" In the first round of voting last month, Keita won nearly 40% of the vote, while Cisse garnered close to 20%. Keita ran for office in 2002 and 2007. He lost both times, most recently to Amadou Toumani Toure. Toure was ousted by a faction of the military in March of last year, plunging Mali, a landlocked country in West Africa, into chaos. A group of outraged soldiers accused the government of not providing adequate equipment to battle ethnic Tuareg rebels roaming the vast desert land in the north. Disgruntled, the soldiers marched to the palace. A few hours later, a soldier appeared on state television and said the military was in control of the nation. The coup leader later stepped down and transferred power to a civilian transitional government. But uncertainty reigned. Islamic extremists, some with ties to al Qaeda, capitalized on the coup. They toppled the Tuareg tribe roaming in the north and seized control of Timbuktu and other cities in the region. They carved out a large portion of the region and began instituting their own laws. Saved from Islamists, Timbuktu's manuscripts face new threat . They banned music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television, and destroyed historic tombs and shrines in the north. World leaders feared that the al Qaeda-linked militants would turn the area into a terrorist haven. Their victories prompted a French-led military campaign in January to flush out the insurgents. France has a close tie to Mali after holding it as a colony from 1898 to 1960. A successful election would allow France to withdraw some of the troops it put in place to halt Islamist militants from advancing toward the capital, Bamako. French troops and United Nations peacekeepers still patrol the streets of the fragile north.

The 59-year-old Pellegrini signed a three-year contract and will begin his role as Roberto Mancini's successor on June 24, the English Premier League club said on its website. Mancini steered City to its first top-flight title in 44 years in 2012 but last season it lagged 11 points behind Manchester United, struggled in Europe and suffered a shock defeat in the FA Cup final. ""Roberto did a great job, it's not easy to win the title after 43, 44 years,"" Pellegrini said. ""But I think now we start a new cycle, adding to what Roberto has done."" The Chilean possesses 25 years of managerial experience, most recently coaching Spanish club Malaga. Like Jose Mourinho's return to Chelsea, Pellegrini was widely expected to join Manchester City following the departure of Mancini. ""He shares the club's approach to football and our ambition to achieve onfield success, coordinating with the wider football support teams to ensure natural progression from the Academy to senior level,"" said Manchester City chief executive Ferran Soriano. After completing a reported $300 million takeover of Manchester City in 2008, Sheikh Mansour has proceeded to spend more than $600 million on players such as Sergio Aguero, Carlos Tevez and Yaya Toure. In contrast, Manchester United's success over the past two decades was based partly on the fruits of its famed youth academy. The likes of David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and the Neville brothers, Phil and Gary, came through the ranks to feature alongside marquee signings Eric Cantona, Peter Schmeichel and Cristiano Ronaldo. Defending its league title last season, City finished a distant second after failing to sign striker Robin van Persie, who went to Manchester United from Arsenal. A pair of younger players signed in the summer transfer window, Scott Sinclair and Jack Rodwell, failed to make an impact. City couldn't escape the Champions League group stage for a second straight term, while Pellegrini's Malaga advanced to the quarterfinals last season for the first time, beaten by eventual finalist Borussia Dortmund. ""We have been greatly impressed throughout the selection process by his philosophy, his attitude, and his commitment to the long-term development of Manchester City,"" City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak said. ""I am delighted that he has joined us."" Pellegrini led Villarreal to a second-place finish in La Liga and the Champions League semifinals, while in his one season with Real Madrid, in 2009-2010, it amassed a then club record 96 points without winning any trophies. Mancini was sometimes criticized for his defensive approach but Pellegrini promised to play attacking football at City. He said others were interested in his services. ""I had other important offers from important clubs,"" he said. In an effort to make up ground on United, City has already made two major signings in the off-season, acquiring Spanish winger Jesus Navas from Sevilla and Brazilian midfielder Fernandinho from Shakhtar Donetsk for a total believed to be $70 million. ""I'm sure we have the best squad in the Premier League, we have wonderful players and can win more titles in the next three or four seasons,"" added Pellegrini. ""Manchester City also has incredible fans. ""I think we have (everything at the club) to be successful."" His hiring completes managerial changes at the top three teams in the Premier League, after David Moyes replaced the retiring Alex Ferguson at Manchester United and Mourinho took over from Rafael Benitez at Chelsea. Mourinho left Real Madrid and Moyes bid adieu to Everton. Malaga, meanwhile, announced Friday that former Real Madrid manager Bernd Schuster would replace Pellegrini at La Rosaleda.","Manuel Pellegrini joins Manchester City on a three-year contract from Malaga .

"CNN's Arwa Damon visited a national park in West Java, part of Indonesia, on March 7, and reports on her experience with scientists working to save the habitat of the endangered gibbon species. Poachers kill the mothers and sell the baby gibbons on the black market. There are only 4,000 Java gibbons left. WEST JAVA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Primatologist Dr. Jatna Supriatna scans the treetops in a national park on the island of Java, looking for gibbons. This area is home to about 150 of the remaining 4,000 Java gibbons. These highly acrobatic creatures are easy prey on the ground and live well above it in the jungle canopy. ""They like the trees here, the fruit from the trees, so sometimes they are here,"" Supriatna says softly, as we trek through the natural beauty with midday light streaming through the foliage. ""This is keystone to the gibbons. You can't kill the trees"" he continues emphatically, pointing out the dainty figs that are a staple part of the gibbons' diet. But that's exactly what's going on. Indonesia has the shameful distinction of holding the ""highest deforestation"" title in the 2008 Guinness Book of World Records, destroying an estimated 300 soccer fields of forest every hour. According to the World Wildlife Fund, these shy and elusive creatures are the most endangered of all ape species. ""They don't have any too big a natural enemy, but encroachment,"" Supriatna explains. Through the foliage we can see the electrical towers from the human communities, slowly eating away at what's left of this protected land. Baby gibbons are also subject to illegal poaching because they are considered cute pets and, according to Supriatna, selling for thousands of dollars on the black market. ""They kill the mother because they want to have the baby,"" Supriatna says. ""So if they kill the mother, there is no chance for survival of the population, of the gibbon."" In a project run by Conservation International, primatologists are trying to rehabilitate gibbons they saved from people's homes. UuUu, a 7-year-old female, is tranquilized and gently moved to the ""introduction cage."" Because gibbons live in family groups, her only chance of survival in the wild is with a mate. As she sits hunched over in a corner, drooling and smacking her lips from the effect of the drugs, in the neighboring cage, Kiss Kiss, a male, emits low whimpers, a visible sign of his agitation.  Watch the effort to get the pair to mate » . UuUu slowly shakes off the drugs and groggily clambers on the fencing. ""They will spend at least a week watching each other,"" Supriatna explains laughing. ""Not like humans. They have to invest a lot in the pairing because when they are in nature, they have to find the right guy for the female because their entire life, they will be there. It's not like they can choose one and just move to the other."" For this species, there are no one-night stands. And Kiss Kiss can attest to just how picky female gibbons can be. He was already rejected by a female he spent six months with. In the five years since this project began, there have only been three successful couplings, between the 16 gibbons at the center. So far no couples have been introduced back into the wild. Not only do the primatologists have to get the pairs to mate, but they also have to teach them vital lessons about their diet. For these gibbons that were snatched from the wild, nature can be poisonous. This makes preserving those already there even more important. Gibbons are a vital part of this already fragile ecosystem, crucial to seed distribution and the health of the ecosystem. Supriatna warns that changing the balance of nature will cause disasters. In the distance, as the afternoon rains start to roll in, we can hear the gibbon's melodic song. Supriatna's picks out the male-female duet. ""Listen, the female [is] usually singing a little bit longer and louder."" The haunting melody gets louder, but the gibbon pair it's coming from isn't close enough for us to see. But its easy to imagine them deftly swinging through the canopy. And the realization sets in, that the gibbon song, like the nature we hear it in, risks being a thing of the past.

"(CNN) -- Adam Scott -- the lanky, easy-going 32-year-old golfer who made history by becoming the first Australian to win the U.S. Masters -- not only has to contend with national hero status at home but also the role of golf's latest sex symbol. Jessica Korda, a member of the LPGA tour who won last year's Women's Australian Open, tweeted: ""Adam Scott!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A million girls just fell in love."" It's not the first time the 6-foot (182cm), 180-pound (81kg) Australian has provoked a Beatlemaniac response on the course . In 2005, during the Players Championship in Florida, Scott struggled to ignore teenage girls yelling their phone numbers at him as he concentrated on his game. ""They looked a little too young to be giving me their phone numbers,"" the self-effacing golfer reportedly told a Florida newspaper at the time. Born in Adelaide, South Australia in 1980, Scott showed early promise as a golfer growing up in Australia's tropical state of Queensland -- a favored golfing destination in Australia. His father, Phil, said he remembers his son hitting a golf ball around a par-three golf course at the age of four. ""In his primary school days a golf club was the same as a cricket bat, tennis racquet or football,"" Scott Snr. told Queensland's The Courier Mail newspaper. ""Whatever he picked up first was good enough."" His father was the first director of golf at Twin Waters Resort and, naturally enough, became his son's coach. He perfected a simple swing technique which Scott has used to devastating effect throughout his career. ""I tried to keep it simple and natural,"" he said. ""As a golf pro, I appreciated the need for solid technique, but I never tried to cloud his mind with too many technical thoughts."" Battling demons . In 1996, at the age of 17, Scott enrolled at Kooralbyn International School south of Brisbane, a school with a renowned golf program. His teacher Peter Claughton told Australian media that Scott had been a cut above the other golfing students. ""Adam was switched on and organised. He knew all about golf courses all over the world, the great players, the touring pros and what other amateurs were doing,"" Claughton said. ""He was single-minded and talked about what he wanted to do. On weekends, he'd plan exactly what he was doing. He wasn't a kid to just hit balls on the practice range. He'd always work on something specific."" From there, the golf prodigy went on to attend the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, turning professional in 2000. Since then, it has been a steady climb. He has won nine PGA Tour events, eight on the European tour, four on the Asian tour, one Sunshine Tour title and three PGA Tour of Australasia competitions. Scott has always idolized Australian golfing giant Greg Norman -- nicknamed was the Great White Shark -- whose defeat in at the U.S. Masters in 1996 became a defining national moment in Australia. Scott is now being viewed as an avenging angel for Norman's defeat from a seemingly unbeatable position. ""Australia is a proud sporting nation,"" Scott told a press conference following his Masters victory. ""And this is one notch in the belt that we had never go."" He then paid tribute to Norman, his childhood idol. ""It was one guy who inspired a nation of golfers, and that is Greg Norman,"" Scott said. ""Part of this definitely belongs to him."" Scott has also had to battle his demons on the golf course, which was epitomized by his stunning capitulation at last year's Open Championship at Royal Lytham in England. Going into the final round with a four-shot lead, a disastrous run of four straight bogeys from the 15th hole saw him finish one shot adrift of former world No. 1 Ernie Els. The young Australian wore a haunted look in the post-match press conference that suggested the experience would permanently scar his sporting psyche. But as with many great Australian sportsmen and sportswomen down the years, Scott's battling determination gave him the last laugh.","The 32-year-old self-effacing golf champion has become a national hero in Australia .

"(CNN) -- The former head of Turkey's military was sentenced to life in prison Monday in the controversial Ergenekon case. CNN Turk reported that Ilker Basbug, a former military chief of staff, and others were sentenced in the lengthy and polarizing court drama. He is the most prominent of hundreds of people accused of trying to overthrow the government. Along with Basbug, other retired high-ranking military officers, journalists, academics and politicians were sentenced. One military figure was Dursun Cicek. The retired navy colonel also got a life sentence, according to Turkish media. ""This is a grave injustice,"" said Irem Cicek, the retired colonel's daughter. ""We will fight against this system. We will resist."" She added, ""I will never forget this court, the names of the prosecutors, the names of the judges. I will never forget or let (them) be forgotten."" Muharrem Ince, a spokesman for the opposition Republican Peoples' Party, called the sentences hostage-takings. ""Our friends are hostages, they are not arrested,"" he said. ""They are not convicts."" The case underscores the divide in Turkey between secularists in the opposition and the military and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's Islamist-oriented government, dominated by his Justice and Development party. Prosecutors have accused hundreds of suspects of being part of a covert ultranationalist organization that wants to overthrow the government and sow unrest. They allege that the group created dozens of websites disseminating propaganda aimed at bringing down Erdogan's government. Supporters of the process say the once-dominant military has a half-century history of overthrowing at least four governments in Turkey and meddling in civilian political affairs. But opponents of the government say the evidence has been fabricated by a government witch hunt intent on weakening and discrediting his secular and military political opposition. Tensions outside the court . The Ergenekon case had its origin in an investigation that began in 2007 after the discovery of a stash of grenades and bomb-making materials in Istanbul. The name is a reference to a mythical story about the origins of the Turkish people. The trials have been taking place at the 13th Istanbul High Criminal Court at the Silivri Prison Complex. More than 60 of the 267 suspects have been in detention -- in some cases for years -- as the court case has slowly proceeded. Along with military officers, the suspects included journalists, academics, political leaders and lawmakers. The roads leading to the court have blocked in all directions by security forces. Citizens who traveled from all points of Turkey to witness the court's verdict had been blocked from getting near the court. As the court began reading the sentences, police intervened in a crowd of roughly 1,000 people protesting the proceeding. Police tried to disperse crowds with water cannons, paint balls and tear gas. Sparks from tear gas canisters on dry grass started a fire. One protester who would identify herself only as Sibel said she was at the gathering for two reasons: to protest a lack of justice and to exercise her right of protest. ""Those of us who were here, we had no weapons, nothing. Just my body, that's my weapon,"" she said. ""They are treating us like criminals, but it is our constitutional right to protest, and they are not allowing us even that."" Others were sentenced . Basbug was in charge of Turkey's military from 2008 to 2010 under Erdogan. Turkish media reported other sentences, including a life sentence for Dogu Perincek, chairman of the socialist Workers Party. Others sentenced include a former Turkish Orthodox Patriarchate spokeswoman, Sevgi Erenerol, who got a life sentence; Kemal Guruz, former head of Turkey's Council of Higher Education, who received a sentence of 13 years; author Ergun Poyraz, 29 years and seven months; Istanbul government official Gurbuz Capan, one year and three months; and academician Umit Sayin, four years. The military people with life sentences include retired Gens. Muzaffer Tekin and Veli Kucuk and retired Col. Albay Arif Dogan. Oktay Yildirim, a former military member whose alleged possession of grenades started the investigation, got nearly 34 years. A lieutenant, Mehmet Ali Celebi, got more than 16 years. The wife of Constitutional Court member Osman Paksut got two years and six months. Others were acquitted, including opposition lawmaker Mehmet Haberal. ""I am very sad, our friends remained here. My heart wants to leave here with my friends. But unfortunately, our country is going through a difficult time. I wish these problems are resolved soon and citizens gain their freedoms back,"" he said. Journalist Tuncay Ozkan also was imprisoned for life. His daughter Nazli was incensed. ""We will not pretend not to see this injustice, to not see how unfair this is. This is just the beginning for us. They will not silence us, and we will prevail."" Nurperi Sancak, one of Perincek's attorneys, told CNN that defense lawyers proved their clients don't belong ""to this fictional organization,"" a reference to Ergenekon. ""I began representing my clients because I believe that they are not being tried for what they did but because of their political affiliations,"" she said. ""Right now, in the conclusion of this case, I am sad, I am disappointed for Turkey. Because I know that when the truth comes out about the faked and made-up evidence, that the younger generation will be ashamed."" Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc told reporters that ""whether we like it or not, we all have to obey the court's decision."" ""No one has the privilege to commit a crime. The judiciary made the decision it saw fit. We will all see what the next step brings together. We are not people that are personally happy to see anyone convicted or arrested, but there is a court decision and everyone must respect that,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Bella Homes LLC, a real estate investment company, and its principals are being sued by the federal government and the state of Colorado for allegedly preying on homeowners in foreclosure. Bella Homes LLC, is a limited liability company organized in Delaware. According to the lawsuit, the company operates from the principals' private residences in Arizona and Georgia, and maintains ""virtual offices"" in Atlanta and Scottsdale, Arizona. The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Denver by Colorado Attorney General John Suthers and U.S. Attorney John Walsh and announced in a joint press release, alleges Bella Homes scammed more than 450 unsuspecting homeowners across the nation, including five in Colorado. The company took in more than $3 million in ""rent"" between March 2010 and this February, according to a press release from the Colorado attorney general's office. The Department of Justice alleges Bella Homes convinced homeowners to transfer their home titles to the company and enter into a type of lease agreement, where the homeowners would then rent or lease their homes back for a fee. During the lease period, Bella Homes claimed if would work to stop foreclosure and would purchase the homeowners' mortgages, according to the release. In exchange, Bella Homes allegedly promised homeowners they could avoid eviction, foreclosure and ruining their credit. The company also told homeowners they would have an exclusive option to ""repurchase their homes in three years for 90 percent of its fair market value and receive credit for 60 percent of the rent paid to Bella Homes,"" according to the release. Homeowners would also ""enjoy a mortgage payment following their repurchase that is 40 percent to 60 percent lower than previous payments."" The complaint alleges Bella Homes did not pay off or assume the existing mortgage, nor did it make make mortgage, tax or insurance payments on the property. Prosecutors contend the promises made by Bella Homes were false and the company actually does very little to actually help homeowners. Calls and e-mails to Bella Homes LLC and its Georgia attorney were not returned over several days. ""Bella Homes gave false hope to desperate homeowners, taking advantage of their desire to do anything to save their homes,"" said U.S. Attorney John Walsh. ""Bella Homes's actions not only hurt those vulnerable homeowners, but the housing market generally. The company will now face the consequences of its misconduct."" U.S. District Judge Marcia Krieger granted a temporary restraining order against Bella Homes on February 15 that prohibited the company from entering into additional deals, and froze Bella Homes' assets. On Sunday, Bella Homes website, bellahomesllc.net, was no longer available. Only the message ""This Account Has Been Suspended"" appeared on the site. Bella Homes does not contest the facts, according to court documents, and it consented to stop making real estate transactions. In addition, the company voluntarily arranged to set aside $500,000 for restitution, pending a resolution in the case. Bella Homes also agreed to cooperate with prosecutors to minimize the negative impact on homeowners and provide a list of homeowners in the Bella Homes program, according to court documents. In the release, Suthers said Colorado law prohibits a loan modification company to charge a homeowner an upfront fee. The company can charge for services rendered, but only once the services are completed. He further warned homeowners that any time someone stops making payments on their mortgage, foreclosure could result. Bella Homes and its principals have not filed a response to the allegations in federal court yet, but the parties are expected to be in court March 6 for a scheduling conference.","Prosecutors allege Bella Homes scammed 450 homeowners .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Strong winds and rough waves Sunday dimmed hopes of rescuing 46 South Korean sailors as search efforts entered their second day following the Friday night sinking of their navy ship off the North Korean coast. South Korean rescuers continued to scour the Yellow Sea on Sunday for the missing sailors from the patrol ship Cheonan, according to the Yonhap News Agency. ""We are hoping to be able to go underwater today,"" a military official said, according to Yonhap. The news agency said that military divers failed Saturday to reach the sunken vessel. The ship was carrying 104 sailors, 58 of whom have been rescued. No bodies or survivors have been found in the sea. No cause has been determined for the ship's sinking, although Yonhap has quoted military officials as saying that an unidentified explosion tore a hole in the ship's rear, shutting off the engine and sinking the ship in fewer than three hours. After visiting the site, Defense Minister Kim Tae-young told the media Saturday that the vessel appears ""to have been split into half."" However, he said making predictions ""is meaningless. ... Please bear with us."" A photograph released to media showed a section of the ship's hull still above water, raising hopes that the sailors could be alive. The navy plans to salvage the sunken vessel to determine what caused the incident, Yonhap reported. It was carrying missiles and torpedoes, Yonhap reported, quoting navy officials. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has ordered a ""quick and thorough"" investigation into what caused the ship to sink, keeping in mind ""all possibilities,"" his office said, according to Yonhap. President Lee met with security officials on Sunday, but the government did not offer new information on the missing sailors. Families of the missing sailors stormed the Pyeongtaek naval base south of Seoul on Saturday afternoon demanding information. Given Baengyeong island's proximity to North Korea, North Korean involvement was feared, but South Korean officials have played down that scenario. And U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Friday that there was no evidence North Korea was behind the incident. Baengnyeong residents had reported hearing gunfire at sea shortly after the Cheonan sank. South Korean officials later confirmed that one of their ships had fired on a radar contact that turned out to be a flock of birds. Presidential spokeswoman Kim Eun-hye told reporters there were ""no unusual signs"" of North Korean activity near the scene. North Korean state media remains silent on the issue. Baengnyeong, a Seoul-administered island,  lies on the Northern Limit Line (NLL), the maritime border between the two states which North Korea disputes and which covers rich crab fishing grounds. The NLL was the scene of fatal naval skirmishes in 1999 and 2002. The two Koreas also exchanged naval gunfire in 2004 and 2009. In recent months, North Korea has been firing coastal artillery into the waters near the island, and shells had been fired earlier Friday, according to news reports. In 2003, a salvage operation to lift a capsized patrol boat -- a vessel much smaller than the 1,200 ton Cheonan -- took 17 days. That patrol vessel was capsized after a gunfight with North Korean naval units.

"Haifa, Israel (CNN) -- Nine years after an American activist was crushed by an Israeli army bulldozer, an Israeli civil court ruled Tuesday that Rachel Corrie's death was an accident. Corrie, 23, was killed in 2003 while trying to block the bulldozer from razing Palestinian homes. Her parents filed suit against Israel's Ministry of Defense in a quest for accountability and sought just $1 in damages. But Judge Oded Gershon ruled Tuesday that the family has no right to damages, backing an earlier Israeli investigation that cleared any soldier of wrongdoing. ""I believe this was a bad day not only for our family, but a bad day for human rights, for humanity, for the rule of law and also for the country of Israel,"" her mother, Cindy Corrie, said after the verdict. ""Rachel's right to life and dignity were violated by the Israeli military,"" she said, adding that her daughter and her family deserve ""accountability."" Driver says he did not see American activist . ""A civil lawsuit is not a substitute for a credible investigation, which we never had. This lawsuit was our only recourse as a family,"" Cindy Corrie explained. But the state prosecutor's office said the driver of the bulldozer couldn't see Corrie. ""The death of Rachel Corrie is without a doubt a tragic accident,"" the office said in a statement. ""As the verdict states -- the driver of the bulldozer and his commander had a very limited field of vision, such that they had no possibility of seeing Ms. Corrie and thus are exonerated of any blame for negligence."" Hussein Abu Hussein, the Corrie family attorney, regards the decision as a ""bad ruling"" for the family and all activists. He said the Corries intend to appeal to Israel's Supreme Court. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev countered criticism of the verdict by saying that ""the whole idea that this was not a serious procedure is simply non-factual."" ""They (the Corries) have lost a loved one, and we can all empathize with them,"" Regev said. ""But I thik their criticism of the Israeli judiciary is unfounded. The Israeli judiciary is known for its independence, which they fiercely guard."" Corrie was nonviolently protesting the demolition of Palestinian civilian homes in Rafah, Gaza, when she died. She was working with the Palestinian-led International Solidarity Movement at the time. Corrie's parents say they have searched for answers in their daughter's death for years. ""The more we found out, the more likely that the killing was intentional, or at least incredibly reckless,"" father Craig Corrie said in 2010. ""As a former soldier, I was even in charge of bulldozers in Vietnam. ... You're responsible to know what's in front of that blade, and I believe that they did."" Craig Corrie said the soldiers, too, are victims. He does not view them with disdain. ""So I'm not full of hatred for this person, but it was a horrendous act to kill my daughter, and I hope he understands that."" In 2010, the Israeli soldier who drove the bulldozer testified publicly for the first time -- from behind a partition. The driver's identity has never been revealed, and he was not charged after a monthlong Israeli investigation found that no Israeli soldier was to blame. Corrie's parents cannot take him to court because the Israeli Supreme Court has upheld a decision to shield him. The driver testified repeatedly that he did not see Corrie before he struck her, saying there was a pile of rubble impeding his vision. Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization Executive Committee and head of the PLO Department of Culture and Information, also condemned the ruling. She said that the evidence shows Corrie was ""deliberately murdered"" and that the Israeli court has victimized her again. ""We must make sure that Rachel Corrie's death is not a senseless incident,"" Ashrawi said in a statement. ""It must be stressed that Israel's habit of blaming the victim and exonerating the criminal is not (only) applied to Palestinian victims, but also it has extended its reach to international solidarity activists and victims of Israeli violence."" Amnesty International said that the court upheld a ""flawed Israeli military investigation, completed within one month"" of Corrie's death and that the ""verdict seems to have ignored substantial evidence presented to the court, including by eyewitnesses."" ""Rachel Corrie was clearly identifiable as a civilian, as she was wearing a fluorescent orange vest when she was killed,"" said Sanjeev Bery, Middle East and North Africa advocacy director for Amnesty International USA. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the United States has worked with the Corries ""all through this process and we will continue to provide consular support. "" ""We understand the family's disappointment with the outcome of the trial. Under Israeli law the family has the right to appeal the verdict and we've seen reports that they are considering doing that. So we will see how this proceeds going forward."" Since Corrie's death, soccer players in Gaza have honored the activist with an annual memorial tournament. ""Rachel Corrie: The Palestinian People Won't Forget Their Highly Respected Friends,"" a wall near the makeshift concrete soccer field reads.

"(CNN) -- On May 9, a cool breeze blew across the waters of San Francisco Bay. Gliding across the surface, two teams of world-class sailors -- Oracle Team USA and Swedish Artemis Racing -- were hard at work preparing for the upcoming America's Cup. According to reports, the wind was ""a little above normal"" at 25 to 35 mph, but nothing that professional sailors couldn't handle. Across the waterfront, anticipation was building ahead of the first America's Cup to be held in the U.S. since 1995. After an uneventful morning training session, disaster suddenly struck, when the 72-ft Artemis catamaran bore violently away from the Oracle, and swiftly capsized. Beneath its vast hull, Olympic gold medalist Andrew Simpson found himself trapped, and despite desperate efforts to save him, the married father of two could not be rescued from the wreckage. Simpson was just 36. Andrew Simpson's early death shocked the world of sailing and brought a glittering career to a premature end. ""Bart"", as he was nicknamed by his friends after the mischievous TV character in ""The Simpsons"", was a talented sailor, a fierce competitor, and a devoted father. His love affair with sailing began early. As a young boy, Simpson's grandparents took him out in a Sea Flyer on the spectacular natural harbour of Christchurch in Dorset. He was instantly smitten, and from that day onwards sailing was always his first passion. After a few years of sailing, Simpson's parents gave him a boat of his own, which he raced alongside future fellow Team GB sailors Iain Percy and the four-time Olympic gold medalist Ben Ainslie. From the very beginning, the youngster's love of the sport and effortless talent caught the eye of national racing coach Jim Saltonstall. Simpson ""enjoyed learning to sail better all the time,"" Saltonstall remarked. Simpson began his career in a Laser class one-man dinghy, but soon graduated to the heftier Finn class -- the perfect boat in which to prepare for his forthcoming Olympic career. In 2000, Simpson was under consideration for the Olympics in Sydney, but ultimately lost his place to best friend Iain Percy whom he had met as a boy. At the age of eight, if it was too windy to sail, Simpson and Percy could often be found building Legos together on the shore. Their friendship was immediate, profound and lifelong. When Sydney 2000 finally came around, Simpson traveled to Australia as Percy's training partner, and proudly helped his old friend to a gold medal. Four years later, Simpson trained alongside teammate Ben Ainslie ahead of the Olympics in Athens. Again, the team found success, with Ainslie taking gold in the Finn class. Finally Simpson earned his own place in the British team as Percy's crewmate at Beijing in 2008. From the moment they began to sail together in preparation for the competition, the two friends thrived. Their partnership brought them bronze at the 2007 Star World Championship -- a strong omen ahead of the Beijing Games. In China, Percy and Simpson performed beautifully, and began the medal race in second place, before fighting hard to regain the lead from Sweden. They sailed across the finish line -- and onward into the history books. The following year Simpson was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), one of Britain's highest honors. On receiving the gold medal, Percy summed up the intimate connection between the pair's professional success and their personal friendship: ""To share it with Bart who's my best mate of years and years, we've been through so much. It's the moment when you've crossed the line and you're on the water, just the two of you. You haven't hit the shore and the crowds and the rest of the team. There's about a 10 minute period which is quite special because it's the two of you that have been on that journey all the way through. It's a really satisfying feeling of two mates who have worked really hard."" Talking to the Royal Yachting Association in 2009, Simpson said he had felt similarly moved: ""It was fantastic. I mean, what do you say? It was the most incredible feeling. You win a gold medal with your best friend and you're on the podium and the national anthem's played and you've just had a really tough regatta. It's not like we won it easy, it was a real war. Yes, It was emotional, for sure. Iain looked like he was going to cry so I put my arm round his back and said 'nice work mate.'"" When it came to competition, Simpson was known as a perfectionist, with a meticulous eye for detail. He had a sophisticated comprehension of the mechanics of sailing and worked tirelessly on his Star ahead of all major competitions. Percy describes Simpson as ""the friendliest, kindest man I have ever met."" Within the sailing fraternity he was both respected and deeply loved. A cavalcade of tweets from sporting luminaries erupted as news of his untimely death spread across the globe. British cyclist Sir Chris Hoy wrote: ""shocked to hear of the death of Andrew Simpson, Olympic Champ sailor. Met him a number of times, great guy. My thoughts are with his family."" Gold winning long jumper Greg Ruthorford echoed Hoy's distress: ""Waking up to hear the tragic news about Andrew Simpson. So very sad, a true gent. My heart goes out to his family."" Tim Jeffrey, a spokesman for the America's Cup, and long-time friend of Simpson said: ""I remember some of the photo shoots ahead of the Olympics where the photographer wanted the guys to look mean and moody and portray synthetic aggression and he just couldn't do that. He was a perpetual grinner. He was given an extra large happy gene."" This week, ahead of the America's Cup, Percy spoke to CNN about his mixed feelings on returning to competition. ""This Cup will always remind me of losing Bart,"" Percy said. ""It will always do that and it's going to be very painful, but professionally the team are going to come out stronger, they're an incredibly talented bunch, an incredibly united group and we're going to hold our head up high and look forward to the future."" Artemis crewmate Paul Cayard added: ""Knowing Bart and what an accomplished person he was, he would want us to accomplish the mission."" The America's Cup opened last week in San Francisco, and will conclude on September 21.","Olympic gold medalist Andrew Simpson caught in accident in the lead up to the America's Cup .

"Washington (CNN) -- Senior career executives of the U.S. agency responsible for processing key veterans benefits will not receive performance bonuses this year following congressional complaints that the government has been too slow to process disability claims. Josh Taylor, a spokesman for the Veterans Administration, said the Veterans Benefits Administration has eliminated bonuses to ensure executives responsible for a backlog of claims are not rewarded since performance goals were not achieved. ""Instead, the funds will be reinvested to accelerate elimination of the backlog. We remain confident that VBA senior executives are dedicated to our nation's veterans, and they will continue to lead our drive toward VA's goal: eliminating the claims backlog in 2015,"" Taylor said. The total bonus payout for career VA executives in fiscal year 2012 was $2.3 million, funds that will now be used to eliminate the backlog, according to an agency official with knowledge of the budget. The benefits administration total was not broken out. Political appointees, like Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, do not receive bonuses. The benefits administration processes disability, pension and other claims for the larger agency. The VA announced an initiative last week aimed at expediting decisions for veterans who have waited one year or longer for compensation claims. ""Too many veterans wait too long for decisions on their compensation claims, and that has never been acceptable. That's why VA has implemented an aggressive plan that will eliminate the decades-long compensation claims backlog in 2015,"" Taylor said. Lawmakers have been increasingly critical of the VA and are applauding the move to cut performance awards. ""VA employees and managers who fail in their jobs shouldn't receive bonuses -- they should be disciplined or fired,"" Rep. Jeff Miller, a Florida Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs.","Executives won't get performance bonuses because of claims backlog .

"Off Chatham, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Calling all great white sharks in the waters off Cape Cod: Please report to Chatham to be measured and tagged by scientists. Researchers are combing these waters for sharks, with the goal of reeling them in, studying them and fitting them with transmitters -- all in just 15 minutes per shark. When CNN visited the 126-foot Ocearch ship at sea this week, the crew had not yet caught a shark despite a week of looking. But they hoped that their patience would be rewarded, as it was last summer with two live captures. Once the scouts find and hook a shark, it is guided to the ship and led into the cradle of a submerged ""sharklift."" The fish is not sedated, so the wranglers have to be careful to avoid being slashed by its sharp teeth or struck by its powerful tail. The goal of such adrenalin-stoking captures: to gather data to better understand what sharks do, where they go and how they live. ""Up until now, the only big sharks I've been able to examine up close and personal have been dead,"" said scientific leader Greg Skomal of the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries. ""This vessel allows you to take it to the next level: bring big fish on board and do multiple studies on live fish."" Not a toy: Shark found on New York subway car . Ocearch fishing master Brett McBride's job is to jump into the water and guide the shark into position. He said the fish don't usually thrash around or try to bite him, but it's clear from videos of past captures that the giant predators can still be active and unpredictable. When he's bringing a shark in, McBride said, he is not focused on fear but on keeping his distance, monitoring the health of the fish and getting the work done quickly. ""I'm not a thrill-seeker kind of person,"" McBride said. ""This has been my whole life, being around animals like this and being in the ocean."" Shark Week special: best places to swim with sharks . He puts two gushing hoses into the mouth of the fish to keep a crucial flow of water over the gills. Then he puts a heavy towel over its eyes to help calm it down. Another worker holds a line looped around the tail, which serves as an early warning system in case the fish is about to whip its tail. Once the 75,000-pound custom sharklift scoops the fish out of the water, the scientific team goes to work. They take blood, tissue and fin samples. They take an ultrasound if the fish is female in hopes of finding a pregnancy. They also record any parasites or contaminants the shark may carry. The workers also attach several transponders to measure and transmit tracking data such as the shark's location, depth, and how it swims. Some transponders are attached by drilling holes in the dorsal fin; others are surgically embedded in the abdomen. Then the fish is set free. The transmitted data is posted on the Ocearch global shark tracker website, which displays the current location of each shark. For example, it shows that ""Mary Lee,"" a shark the researchers tagged off Cape Cod last year, has since been up and down the coast, from Long Island to Georgia and South Carolina; it even made a quick trip to Bermuda. Discovery Channel defends dramatized shark special 'Megalodon' Skomal says he is fascinated by everything about sharks: their sleek shape, their effortless swimming, their strength, and of course, their powerful jaws and famously sharp teeth, serrated to cut into big animals such as seals. Hundreds of seals gather in Chatham harbor and on the Cape Cod shoreline, barking and snuffling, harrumphing across the sand, and their whiskered faces pop out of the surf. It is their plentiful numbers that draw the great white sharks to this coastline, which also draws many beachgoers. Skomal says the purpose of all this scientific work is both to improve public safety and conservation. Ocearch -- whose mission is to study and preserve marine life, especially sharks -- says that in areas like Cape Cod, where shark sightings often force beaches to close during the height of summer, beach managers could use the tracking data to understand how sharks move and make beaches safer. Expedition leader Chris Fischer says that when it comes to the threat sharks pose to humans, their reputation is worse than the reality. ""These animals are very skittish, very nervous and don't want to really be around people at all,"" he said. Experts note that while sharks might kill a half dozen people per year, people kill tens of millions of sharks. When it comes to conservation, the Ocearch scientists hope that their data about the travels and behavior of a threatened animal could help inform decisions about managing and protecting it. Skomal says great white sharks are an extraordinary and irreplaceable animal. ""Sharks are a critical component. They're the top predators. If you remove those top predators, then something on which they feed may come out of balance,"" he said. ""You get this cascade of effects that ultimately causes real problems - not only for the ocean, but also really for man.""","Shark researchers seek to temporarily capture the fish off Massachusetts to collect data .

"(CNN) -- You are only a short putt away from a major championship and golfing immortality. You can already taste the acclaim, hear the roars from the gallery crowded round the 18th green and smell the bundles of cash heading your way. But then an image of Rory McIlroy slumped over his driver at Augusta in 2011 flashes through your mind, Adam Scott sinking to the turf at the British Open a year later after throwing away a four-shot lead. Before you know it, you're having dark visions of Jean Van de Velde wading through the Barry Burn at Carnoustie during his own British Open meltdown in 1999. Suddenly that putt looks a lot longer than it did a moment ago and you start wondering, ""What if I miss?"" You may also start questioning why you didn't pay a pre-tournament visit to golf's premier mind doctor, whose job it is to instil a watertight frame of mind that can deal with a career-defining putt. ""Players will tell you, you can get teary-eyed thinking what this could mean to your mum and dad, your wife, your children, for your name in history,"" Dr. Bob Rotella told CNN ahead of this week's PGA Championship in Rochester, New York. It is the final major of the golf season -- where McIlroy will defend his title, and world No. 1 Tiger Woods will seek to end a five-year wait for the 15th of his career. ""You could start adding up how many dollars you're going to make. It is like, 'Can we just take care of this putt right now?' You need the ability to get lost in the present where nothing else in the moment exists,"" Rotella added. ""This putt is something you've done a million times both in your mind and on the practice putting green and on the golf course. ""Now you've got to let yourself do it in this important situation but in order to do it you better not be reminding yourself how big this is or important this is. ""Most guys are trying to treat it like just another putt. But it's difficult because your hands are shaking a bit, your arms are shaking a bit, your heart is beating like crazy, you can't get any moisture in your mouth."" Golf is a cruel and unforgiving pursuit in which the word ""choke"" seems to reappear more than any other. Often, a major meltdown can be more memorable than the eventual winner. Just ask McIlroy about Augusta, veteran Tom Watson about losing a playoff at the British Open in 2009 or consult Greg Norman on his capitulation to let Nick Faldo win the 1996 Masters. Interactive: What do major winners earn? That knowledge surely only adds fuel to the fire when a player is in a trough that must feel like it is squeezing the life out of his game. Though there is a caddy by your side, only one person can extricate you from this mess. No wonder then that training the brain has become as pivotal a part of a modern player's preparation as the hours spent honing their swing on the range. Rotella has worked with some of the game's biggest stars, major champions like McIlroy, Padraig Harrington, Keegan Bradley and Darren Clarke, who are all keen to tap into his well of knowledge. With a myriad of professionals capable of winning major honors and the intensity of competition rising all the time, players are increasingly obsessed with squeezing every last drop out of their potential. Even the very best players aren't impervious to pressure, so Rotella's work acts to soothe increasingly frazzled brains so they can plot a path to glory. What, then, does he tell players about that moment, when one shot can make or break their careers? ""We're trying to get to the best state of mind and trying to catch it if we get half an inch away from that instead of waiting to get in a deep dark hole and having to dig yourself out,"" he said. ""We're talking about believing you're the best golfer in the world in a world that has a lot of really, good, talented and committed golfers. ""Everyone wasn't brought up thinking that way; a lot of people find it easy to respect other people or to believe in somebody else winning. ""Players have to learn as they develop skill that now you've developed this skill now you have to fall in love with your talent and your potential and ability if you're going to be the best golfer in the world."" It is no surprise many of Rotella's subjects have held it together right at the moment they needed to most. Bradley won the first major he played in -- the 2011 U.S. PGA Championship -- surviving a nerve-jangling playoff against Jason Dufner. He credited the work he did with Rotella in helping him to stay focused after a triple-bogey on the 15th hole in his final round looked to have ripped his dream to shreds. After his triumph, Bradley said he actually felt energized after his mistake, such was the positive frame of mind Rotella had helped him download. At the other end of the spectrum, Clarke was playing in his 46th major championship when he hit the front at the 2011 British Open. One of a rare crop to win his first major title over the age of 40, Clarke had Rotella on hand all week to keep him cool in the heat of battle at Royal St. George's on the southern coast of England. But not before Rotella had to iron out a major putting wobble before the tournament even began. ""We spent a lot of time together during his Open win,"" Rotella said. ""In Darren's case it started Wednesday and he was totally lost with his putter. ""He said to me, 'If we can get my head in the right place with my putter I think it'll take all the pressure off my ball striking and pitching and bunker play and I'll be fine.' ""Over the next few days we got his head where he wanted to with the putter, and magic happened. He started doing some great stuff and the ball started going in the hole and he won. ""I think the last step for Darren was to let himself go out on Sunday -- the phrase we kept saying was, 'You're unstoppable if you're unflappable.' ""I kept telling Darren you've got to be unflappable, you can't let a good shot that takes a bad bounce bother you or get you down or frustrated. You've got to stay in a good mood. ""For Darren, he had to be himself. When I think of Darren I think of really good-natured, happy guy. I said to him don't have the only place you're not happy be on a golf course."" Happy might not be a word most closely associated with the leader of the PGA Championship if he has a one-shot lead to protect down the final hole on Sunday but if he's spoken to Rotella, at least he'll be in the zone.","Work on mental preparation has become a vital part of golf in recent times .

"(Departures) -- It's not hard to identify the cultural capitals of the world. Cities such as Paris, Rome, London, Istanbul, Berlin and New York are the first-round picks for travelers seeking the best of fine art, architecture, history, music and food. And deservedly so — any one of these towns offers such an embarrassment of riches, it would be easy to spend a lifetime exploring their greatest hits. With Paris's museums and Rome's architecture, Berlin's art scene and New York's gastronomy, why bother looking farther afield? There are, actually, many reasons. Some of the world's best, most interesting cultural offerings, monuments and movements can be found outside the major centers. As any well-traveled polyglot knows, some of the best finds require veering off the beaten path (and perhaps down the stairs and through an unmarked door). For every well-trod favorite there is a lesser-known city with a buzzing cultural scene worth discovering and mercifully few tourists vying for access to the best sites. Departures: World's most cultured beach cities . Those visiting Germany, for example, might skip Berlin in favor of Dresden, a gorgeous Baroque metropolis that was the center of German high culture until it was destroyed during World War II. Its famous philharmonic survived, though, and a painstaking restoration process has revitalized the city as a destination for art and architecture. Or contemplate Helsinki: The Finnish capital rarely makes the list of European places to visit, but the city, named 2012's World Design Capital, is exploding with new design initiatives, cutting-edge architecture and creative innovation. Whether undergoing a renaissance or remaining a well-kept secret, all the destinations on this list are — suffice it to say — worth the journey. GALWAY, Ireland . The scene: A seaside sampling of traditional Irish heritage. The signature: Galway lies on the coast of Ireland, in a part of the country strongly connected to traditional Irish culture. (Many of the city's outlying villages are primarily Gaelic-speaking.) Visit Taibhdhearc na Gaillimhe, the country's national Irish language theater, to get a taste of the interplay between Ireland's heritage and the city's art scene. Insider knowledge: Galway is a wonderful place to hear traditional Irish music — or ""trad"" music. Skip tourist traps and opt instead for local pubs like Crane Bar. Don't miss: The beautiful St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church, which was built in 1320 and has the distinction of being the largest medieval parish church in the country. ALMATY, Kazakhstan . The scene: A post-Perestroika bloom of experimental art and theater against a backdrop of traditional architecture flourishes. The signature: For an introduction to Kazakh culture, visit the National Museum, which stands across from the presidential palace and offers exhibits on Kazakh art and history. Afterward visit idyllic Panfilov Park to see St. Ascension Cathedral, which is one of the largest wooden structures in the world built entirely without nails. Insider knowledge: The theater scene is where the most interesting, cutting-edge art is happening. Catch a show at Art & Shock Theatre, the internationally acclaimed conceptual theater group, or visit Lermontov Russian Drama Theatre, which stages Russian plays Tuesday to Sunday and turns the theater into an exhibit space for local contemporary artists on Mondays. Don't miss: An exhibit at Arvest Art Gallery, which opened five years ago and has quickly become the contemporary arts center of the city. Departures: New attractions in New York City . ANTWERP, Belgium . The scene: Quirky and modern northern European style meets classic Flemish elegance. The signature: Antwerp is a blend of the historic and the contemporary. For a taste of the historic, visit the iconic 14th-century Cathedral of Our Lady, which houses several important paintings by Peter Paul Rubens. For a modern turn, stop by the flagship location of Dries Van Noten, Antwerp's most significant avant-garde fashion designer. Insider knowledge: Typeface enthusiasts will love the Museum Plantin-Moretus, which honors the history of typography. The collection includes the two oldest printing presses in the world. Plan to go at the end of the week since the museum is located in the Vrijdagmarkt, a 16th-century square known for its Friday market. Don't miss: Rubenshuis, the former home and studio of the painter Rubens. The house is an architectural curiosity, built to resemble a Renaissance-era Italian palace and featuring a Baroque garden and a portico. Guests can tour here now and see many of the artist's most famous works, including Adam and Eve. DRESDEN, Germany . The scene: An old cultural hub revives 60 years after mass destruction. The signature: Before World War II, Dresden was Germany's arts capital, but much of its famous architecture was destroyed in the firebombing of 1945. The stone Frauenkirche, or Church of Our Lady, underwent a $218 million restoration in 2006 to mark the city's 800th birthday and now anchors the Altstadt (Old Town). See other beautifully restored Baroque buildings here, like the Zwinger Palace or the Semperoper. Insider knowledge: Six times a year the illustrious Dresden Philharmonic performs in the Frauenkirche -- including concerts for Advent and New Year's and two events this coming season to mark Wagner's 200th birthday. Don't miss: Visit the Military History Museum to explore how the city has been affected -- structurally and socially -- by war. The museum, one of Germany's largest, is only a year old but offers important, if painful, insight into Dresden's cultural past. Departures: 10 new reasons to love the Old South . HELSINKI, Finland . The scene: Imaginative, hyper-current European design. The signature: Helsinki is nearing the end of its year as the World Design Capital, a distinction that brought a major influx of artists, events and design-related projects. There is plenty to catch between now and December, including a food-and-design pop-up market at the city's abattoir (slaughterhouse) and the timber-made Kamppi Chapel of Silence, recently built in bustling Narinkka Square. Insider knowledge: Only Helsinki's food scene rivals its design scene. Visit Chez Dominique, the city's only restaurant with two Michelin stars, to sample Finnish gastronomy at its most elevated. Or swing by Herring Market for a taste of Helsinki's fishier heritage. Don't miss: Wander Punavuori, the Design District, to get the most concentrated dose of Helsinki style. The neighborhood boasts a little of everything, from antiques and fine art at Haddadin to runway fashions from Ivana Helsinki, an art, fashion and film collective that just showed at New York fashion week. HAVANA, Cuba . The scene: A postcolonial time warp with a thriving music scene. The signature: A decades-long embargo has taken Havana off the radar for most American travelers -- and suspended the city in the aesthetics of the 1960s (picture old Ford Thunderbirds on the roads) -- but the music keeps evolving. Hear Cuba's biggest acts alongside up-and-comers at Casa de la Música Miramar. Insider knowledge: Skip the government-run restaurants and opt instead for paladares, privately run eateries like La Galería, which serves elevated Cuban fare on a breezy terrace. Don't miss: El Malecón, an esplanade and seawall that begins in Old Havana and stretches four miles up the coast. The walk offers views of several of the city's important historical landmarks, like El Morro castle and the Castillo de San Salvador de la Punta. Departures: Secret European summer getaways . Le Mans, France . The scene: Ancient history meets pastoral French charm. The signature: While best known for its epic annual 24-hour auto race, Le Mans dates back to the first century B.C. and has a rich cultural history, including links to the Plantagenet dynasty. Visitors can wander cobbled streets among 15th-century timber houses in the old town, and the recently renovated Carré Plantagenêt gives a good overview of the region's history. Insider knowledge: The Entre Cours et Jardins Festival gives the public access to roughly 20 exquisite -- and often classically French -- private gardens in the region.

"(EW.com) -- Many assumed that the weekend before the debut of ""Man of Steel"" would be a calm one at the box office, but that was not the case. Universal's thriller ""The Purge"" surged into the top spot this weekend and shattered all expectations with a massive $36.4 million debut. The film, produced by ""Paranormal Activity"" mastermind Jason Blum, cost only $3 million to make, and because its marketing campaign was predominantly digital (read: inexpensive), the micro-budgeted film will become a hugely profitable release for the currently on-fire Universal. ""The Purge"" had an intriguing premise: for one night every year, all crime (including murder) is legal. Universal's marketing team effectively communicated that twisted plot in trailers and ads, and the premise helped pack theaters, though it didn't deliver on audiences' high expectations. Crowds issued the film a discouraging ""C"" CinemaScore grade, and the film sank 38 percent from Friday to Saturday — a sign of poor word-of-mouth. ""The Purge"" gave star Ethan Hawke his best opening weekend ever — trouncing ""Training Day""'s $22.6 million debut in 2001. Hawke also thrived on the indie circuit this weekend, as his film ""Before Midnight"" scored $585,000 from just 52 locations for an early $1.5 million total. ""Before Midnight""'s robust $11,243 per theater average trailed only one other film in the Top 20: ""The Purge,"" which had a sizzling $14,353 average at its 2,536 locations. EW: The four emotional stages of watching 'The Purge' Universal reports that audiences for ""The Purge"" were quite diverse, with Hispanic moviegoers making up 33 percent of ticket buyers. Interestingly, the film also played predominantly to women, who accounted for 56 percent of the audience. Another Universal film held strong in second place. ""Fast & Furious 6"" decelerated by a healthy 44 percent to $19.8 million and has now earned $203 million total after three weekends. The $160 million sequel is just days away from surpassing ""Fast Five""'s $209 million domestic cume, and with $584.6 million globally, it will soon race past Five's $626.1 million worldwide total. Notably, ""Fast & Furious 6"" gave star Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson his 16th straight week in the Top 10. Last weekend's surprise breakout ""Now You See Me"" worked some more box-office magic in its second weekend. Summit's $80 million thriller declined just 34 percent to $19.5 million, giving the magician thriller a $61.4 million total after 10 days. With a few more weeks of sturdy holds like this, ""Now You See Me"" could become an impressive $100 million hit. EW: 20 scariest movies of all time . Fox's Vince Vaughn/Owen Wilson comedy ""The Internship"" opened in fourth place with $18.1 million, a somewhat tepid result from the duo that helped ""Wedding Crashers"" debut with $33.9 million back in 2005. Google, which is featured throughout the film, is likely used to better launches. While ""The Internship"" did exceed Fox's modest expectations, its mild $5,377 per theater average and the looming competitor ""This is the End"" may hurt its box office longevity. On the bright side, The $58 million comedy did earn a ""B+"" CinemaScore grade from audiences, which were split 50/50 between males and females and were 61 percent above the age of 25. Spending one final weekend in the Top 5 was Epic, which dipped only 27 percent (the smallest drop in the Top 10) to $12.1 million. After three weekends, the $100 million animated film has earned $84.2 million. 1. The Purge -- $36.4 million . 2. Fast & Furious 6 -- $19.8 million . 3. Now You See Me -- $19.5 million . 4. The Internship -- $18.1 million . 5. Epic -- $12.1 million . In milestone news, ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" passed the $200 million mark. Thanks to the J.J. Abrams-directed film' $11.7 million weekend, Darkness has now earned $200.1 million domestically, and it's running a tad behind 2009′s ""Star Trek,"" which had earned $209.3 million at the same point in its run. In limited release, Joss Whedon's Shakespeare adaptation ""Much Ado About Nothing"" fared very well in five theaters, earning $183,000 — enough for a $36,600 per theater average.

"(CNN) -- A youth pastor and his pregnant wife were among the three people killed when a bus overturned Saturday afternoon in Indiana, a deacon from the pastor's church said Sunday. The bus was returning from a camp in Michigan, said Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard. Chad Phelps, pastor at Colonial Hills Baptist Church, and his wife, Courtney, were expecting their second child next month, Deacon Jeff Leffew said. The third fatality was Tonya Weindorf, a mother of five acting as a chaperone on the trip, Leffew said. ""They are with God in heaven right now. We know that without a doubt,"" Leffew said, ""but we grieve for the fact that they are not here with us."" The accident injured 19 more people out of about 40 passengers on the bus. A total of eight remained in two hospitals as of Sunday night. One of the injured remains in critical condition, a spokeswoman for Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital said. Most of those on board were teenagers, according to Indianapolis Fire Department spokeswoman Rita Burris. Leffew asked for prayers and support as the church and victims recover. ""We're going to have a long road,"" he said. The driver told witnesses that the vehicle's brakes failed as it was trying to make a left turn, Burris said. The bus ended up on its side on a concrete road barrier with luggage and other debris strewn on the roadway. ""I saw bodies everywhere, kids in shock and disbelief,"" said John Murphy, who had stopped along the northern Indianapolis road where the bus crashed. ""There was an awful lot of blood."" Rose Vorenkamp was driving when she saw the overturned bus and ""people running"" to help. Having been trained through her job in first aid and CPR, she moved closer and saw what she described as a girl trapped under the bus, bloodied passengers with head injuries and at least one person with a dislocated shoulder. The fire department noted that four passers-by arrived first to help, including one who helped pull the driver from the bus. Those helping were met soon by firefighters and crews from 12 ambulances and four helicopters. Indianapolis police spokesman Michael Hewitt said two passengers were airlifted from the crash, nine were treated and released at the scene of the accident and others were taken to local hospitals. Family members subsequently gathered at the church, Colonial Hills Baptist, where the bus had been heading. The scene there was ""remarkably positive, very sad, but at the same time very together,"" Ballard said. ""Some of the teenagers are hurting very badly. You can see it in their faces,"" the mayor said. Some people at the church thanked him for visiting and generally appeared strong, Ballard added, surmising that ""it's very clear that they are being guided by their faith right now."" Still, the mayor added, they might have some tough days ahead of them. ""The next few days are always very, very painful as they come out of the shock of it,"" he said. The bus is believed to be the only vehicle involved in the crash, according to Hewitt. At least 30 killed in bus crash in southern Italy .","NEW: Eight people remained hospitalized Sunday night .

"(CNN) -- A Canadian man is accused of opening fire in a court building in the Philippines on Tuesday, killing two people and wounding himself and one other person, authorities said. The incident is likely to add to the debate over stricter controls on firearms in the country, which has been rattled by a series of recent shootings. Read related: Gunman kills 9 in house-to-house rampage in Philippine town . The official Philippines News Agency (PNA) reported that the gunman ""went berserk"" at the Hall of Justice the city of Cebu. It identified the suspect in the case as John Pope, a Canadian. Facing a criminal case in the courts, the gunman fatally shot the complainant in the case, who was believed to be a doctor, and the doctor's lawyer, the Philippine Supreme Court said, citing initial police reports. Besides the gunman, the other person wounded in the attack was Maria Theresa Casino, a prosecutor who is in a critical condition, according to the PNA. The Supreme Court said that the names of those involved were still being verified and that it was sending an official to Cebu to investigate the shooting. The Supreme Court has supervisory responsibilities over such court buildings in the Philippines, the PNA cited Prosecutor General Claro Arellano as saying. Arellona said there had been a severe lapse in security at the building in Cebu and called on the Supreme Court to take steps to prevent if from happening again. Cebu police officials weren't immediately available to comment on the matter. Earlier this month, a gunman went from house to house in a town near the capital, Manila, killing at least 9 people. And on New Year's Eve, a 7-year-old girl died after being shot in the head amid celebratory gunfire. The country's Firearms and Explosives Office says there were 1.2 million registered firearms in the Philippines as of last year, according to CNN affiliate ABS-CBN. On top of that, the office estimates there were 600,000 unlicensed firearms in circulation nationwide. Government officials have suggested that better enforcement of existing gun laws is required rather than the introduction of new rules.","NEW: The man suspected of carrying out the shooting is Canadian, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Senate nominee Alvin Greene, a political unknown who became the surprise winner of the South Carolina Democratic primary, was indicted Friday by a grand jury on obscenity charges. Greene was indicted on one felony count of ""disseminating, procuring or promoting obscenity,"" according to the Richland County clerk of courts. He was also indicted on a misdemeanor count of ""communicating an obscene message to another person without consent."" Greene told CNN Senior Political Editor Mark Preston that his lawyer ""is dealing"" with the indictments. Following the announcement of Greene's indictment, South Carolina Democratic Party Chair Carol Fowler released a statement asking Greene to resign. ""In June, I asked Mr. Greene to withdraw his candidacy because of the charges against him. Following today's indictments, I repeat that request,"" Fowler said. ""It will be impossible for Mr. Greene to address his legal issues and run a statewide campaign.   The indictment renews concerns that Mr. Greene cannot represent the values of the Democratic Party or South Carolina voters."" Greene was charged by police in November with showing pornographic material to a female University of South Carolina student on a computer in the school's library. The alleged victim, according to university police, also said Greene asked if he could come to her room. The woman said the incident happened November 4. Greene's June 8 primary victory stunned politicians in South Carolina because they had never heard of him and saw no proof he had mounted any type of campaign.  His Democratic opponent, Vic Rawl, tried to have the election overturned, saying there were voting machine irregularities, but the state party denied the request. The existence of the obscenity-related criminal charges didn't surface until after the primary win.  State Democratic leaders called on Greene to step aside.  He is believed to have little chance of running a serious campaign against incumbent Republican Sen. Jim DeMint. Greene has remained tight-lipped regarding the obscenity charges. ""I'm innocent until proven guilty. ... I'm concentrating on my campaign issues: jobs, education and justice,"" he said in a recent interview.  He refused to answer any more questions regarding the allegations. The obscenity issue is one of several controversies swirling around Greene's long shot candidacy.  Observers have also questioned how the 32-year-old nominee, who is believed to have very little personal wealth, was able to afford the $10,440 filing fee required to get his name on the Democratic Senate primary ballot. South Carolina's top law enforcement agency said it determined that Greene used his own money to pay the fee, though the state attorney general's office said it did not receive a request from the agency to subpoena Greene's bank records. Greene's military record also has raised questions. Greene, according to records obtained by The Associated Press, was denied two promotions and made ""mistakes as severe as uploading sensitive information improperly, and as basic as an overall inability to clearly express his thoughts and perform basic tasks."" The records cover three years of Greene's service in the Air Force. Greene was discharged from the military in August 2009. Greene recently attracted attention to his candidacy by proposing to create jobs in South Carolina by making ""toys of me, especially for the holidays. Little dolls. Like maybe action dolls.  Me in an Army uniform, Air Force uniform, and me in my suit."" CNN's Steve Brusk and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report .","Alvin Greene has been indicted on two obscenity charges .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN)   -- A suspected U.S. drone strike killed four suspected militants in northwestern Pakistan on Monday night, Pakistani intelligence officials told CNN. The unmanned Predator drone fired two missiles at a vehicle driving on a main road in North Waziristan, one of seven districts in Pakistan's mostly ungoverned tribal region along the Afghan border, the two officials said. The officials asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media. North Waziristan is the home base of the Pakistani Taliban and described by Washington as a safe haven for militant groups fueling the insurgency across the border in Afghanistan. The attack occurred roughly an hour after locals ended their daily fast for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Based on a count by CNN's Islamabad bureau, Monday's drone strike was the 48th this year, compared to 111 last year. Journalists Saboor Khattak and Shaan Khan contributed to this report.","Two missiles are fired at a vehicle, killing four suspected militants .

"(CNN) -- Editor's note: Watch CNN's TV theme week Comic Book Heroes from June 10-17 on World Report, CNN Newstream and I-desk. Last year I failed to become Superman. Not a super man, the Superman. The search for the official Metropolis Superperson is an annual and international event. Organizers receive hundreds of photos from people who aspire to be a muscular, bullet-proof fictional character with no visible genital definition. But before I could hand in my resume and lie -- ""I've traveled 20 million light years from my home. I look upon my powers as a gift. Not mine but to anyone who needs them"" -- I was told I had to be over six foot, have black hair rather than no hair, be around 30 years old and have a 12-13 American shoe size. ""Buff and with no accent,"" said the lady from the Metropolis Chamber of Commerce, knowing that she was no Miss Teschmacher. ""Our first Superman was the local Baptist preacher. Everyone wants to be Superman. We get applications from everywhere. Even Japan."" Just a regular nuclear reactor-supplying town . For most of the year the Illinois town of Metropolis in the American Midwest is a quiet place, with a population of 7,000, a riverboat casino and a mill churning out material for nuclear reactors. No one bench-presses any cars. No one freezes anything with their breath. Although the local burritos can help you exert the propulsive force of very high winds. And some of the keg beer is similar to Kryptonite, immobilizing you with pain and nausea, and robbing you of your powers of taste. But for a few days in summer (June 6-9, 2013), the town becomes soop central, putting on the ""Superman Celebration."" This year is a big one: the Diamond Jubilee. Remarkably, though the great man is 75, his adventures continue. Not with hair re-seeding or knee replacement surgery, but with a new movie. Zack Synder's ""Man of Steel,"" starring Brit Henry Cavell, Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner, is released on June 14. The big party in Metropolis will have superhero-related celebrity autograph sessions from the likes of Margot Kidder and Michael Rosenbaum, a Smallville prom, a Superman mastermind quiz (everyone knows Clark Kent parts his hair the different side to Superman), a fans' film festival and, of course, a $1,000 First Prize lookalike pageant ($25 entry). Town mayor, Billy McDaniel, will be on hand to swear in visitors as ""honorary citizens"" of his friendly community on the Ohio River near the Kentucky border. Share your Superman memories and images . Most Supermen gathered . There's also a chance to become a Guinness World Record holder by being part of the world's largest-ever gathering of people dressed as Superman. The record is currently held by 437 Canadians. Says Mayor McDaniel: ""The annual Superman Celebration brings so much more than just tourism to our small community. It brings out the superhero in all of us."" You can also buy a personalized brick ($75) to be placed around the pedestal or walkway to the Lois Lane statue on the corner of West Eighth and Market, between the chiropractor and ""the home of super financial services"" -- the bank. Or you can have your photograph taken standing between Superman's legs underneath the 22-foot, $120,000, vandal-resistant bronze Superman statue in Superman Square in the ""Home of Superman."" It's meant to bring good luck. President Obama posed there and he got re-elected. Beneath the sculpture is the inscription ""Truth, Justice -- the American Way."" ""It's our second statue,"" the lady from the Chamber of Commerce says. ""The first one was fiberglass and he was short, fat and ugly. People thought he had big feet and looked like Prince Charles. ""He also seemed to suffer from an ocular condition."" The Super Museum will be open. It's curated by former Californian housewares salesman and self-professed ""Superman nut,"" Jim Hambrick, whose 100,000-plus item collection includes the suit worn by George Reeves in the first color television episodes of ""Adventures of Superman."" The town and the world can't wait. Gift shops will stock anti-thrombotic support tights. Sponsors of Metropolis's 35th Superman Celebration include Thor's Gym. Superman speaks . Joshua Boultinghouse is the resident Superman. ""I enjoy portraying Superman because for four days out of the year I get to be the man I always try to be,"" he says. ""I don't mean being invulnerable. I mean I get to represent all that is good, honest and pure about humanity. ""I think we all (for the most part) aspire to be like that, but for four days especially I have to be like that in front of the fans and especially for the children. ""And it gives me hope that maybe one day we all can be like that."" D.C. Comics' Superman first appeared in June 1938. Three quarters of a century, 2,000 comic appearances and six movies later, the Man of Steel hasn't changed a great deal. Except he's no longer bald. Superman was created in June 1933 by an Ohio writer named Jerry Siegel and Canadian illustrator Joe Schuster as a follicularly challenged baddie who read minds. Then came the makeover modeled on Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Alter ego Clark Kent was named after matinee idols Clark Gable and Kent Taylor, with his looks based on comedian Harold Lloyd. DC Comics' Metropolis was named after the title of a Fritz Lang movie. Metropolis, Illinois, has been Metropolis since 1889. Its only factual claim to fame is that The Birdman of Alcatraz is buried there. Metropolis was Robert Stroud's hometown. The local newspaper is called ""The Metropolis Planet."" It's not called ""The Daily Planet."" It's a weekly. The town's chief other attraction is a telephone box. In it, rather than undress, I looked through the local directory. But couldn't find one Clark Kent. Only a Stanley and a Wendell.

"(CNN) -- Abu Yahya al-Libi, the No. 2 man in al Qaeda and a longtime public face of the terrorist network, is dead, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday. Al-Libi's death was ""another serious blow to core al Qaeda,"" said Carney. ""His death is part of the degradation taking place in core al Qaeda in the last several years,"" Carney said. Earlier Tuesday, U.S. officials said that al-Libi was killed Monday by a CIA drone strike in Pakistan. Al-Libi's death marks one of the most significant blows to al Qaeda since the U.S. military killed Osama bin Laden in a daring nighttime raid in Pakistan a year ago. Al-Libi was second-in-command behind al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, who took the helm after bin Laden's death. What does this mean for al Qaeda? ""There is no one who even comes close in terms of replacing the expertise (al Qaeda) has just lost,"" said a U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Al-Libi ""played a critical role in the group's planning against the West, providing oversight of the external operations efforts,"" the official said. ""Zawahiri will be hard-pressed to find any one person who can readily step into Abu Yahya's shoes,"" the official said. ""In addition to his gravitas as a longstanding member of AQ's leadership, Abu Yahya's religious credentials gave him the authority to issue fatwas, operational approvals and guidance to the core group in Pakistan and regional affiliates."" Monday's strike was the third such deadly attack in as many days and the 21st suspected U.S. drone strike in Pakistan this year. At least six missiles were fired at a militant compound near the town of Mir Ali in the North Waziristan region near the Afghanistan border. Official: 15 militants killed in suspected U.S. drone strike in Pakistan . Some jihadists do not believe the report and will continue to wage jihad, said the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors Islamist extremism. ""Most jihadists discussing the issue prayed that Libi is still alive and urged fellow supporters to await confirmation,"" the group said on its website. ""Some took the news as fact and prayed that he be accepted by God as a 'martyr.' One jihadist wrote: 'Just as the Sheikh said more than once, our jihad is not dependent on an individual and not even on a group. So, if al-Qaeda is annihilated hero by hero and only its memory remains (!!), jihad will remain standing by the command of Allah.'"" Their skepticism may be well-founded. Reports that emerged a couple of years ago that al-Libi was slain proved incorrect. Al Qaeda's leadership has been so thinned by the U.S. drone campaign in Pakistan that these men were the only two real leaders of the organization left, U.S. counterterrorism officials said, according to CNN Security Analyst Peter Bergen. Al Qaeda offshoots in other parts of the world, such as the group's affiliate in Yemen, have meanwhile become more potent and worrisome to the United States. An Islamic scholar and high-ranking member of the group, al-Libi frequently appeared in videos posted on the Internet. He delivered speeches praising al Qaeda leaders, urging resistance and trying to recruit new members. ""Al-Libi is a key motivator in the global jihadi movement and his messages convey a clear threat to U.S. persons or property worldwide,"" said a ""Wanted"" statement posted on the website of the U.S. State Department's ""Rewards for Justice"" program, which offers rewards for information about suspected terrorists. Read more about drones on CNN's Security Clearance blog . ""Al-Libi is believed to be in hiding in Afghanistan or Pakistan,"" said the website, which offered a reward of up to $1 million for the 49-year-old Libyan. Al-Libi purportedly was among al Qaeda leaders focusing on Libya since last year to establish a presence there. In a video message to fellow Libyans distributed on jihadist forums in December, al-Libi said, ""At this crossroads you have found yourselves: You either choose a secular regime that pleases the greedy crocodiles of the West and for them to use it as a means to fulfill their goals, or you take a strong position and establish the religion of Allah."" Al-Libi was captured in 2002 and imprisoned at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, according to the U.S. government, but he escaped in 2005. Al Qaeda's most wanted . In 2008, a statement posted on radical Islamic websites known to carry messages from al Qaeda described how four ""military leaders"" including al-Libi escaped from the prison, but the statement said then that one of the escapees, Abu Abdallah al-Shami, had been killed in a U.S. airstrike. The statement said that, among those escaping with al-Shami, was key al Qaeda figure Omar al-Faruq, who died in a subsequent British airstrike. Another escapee, Abu Nasir al-Qahtani, was captured in Afghanistan in 2006. Al-Shami's death left al-Libi as the only remaining member of that escape who had not been killed or captured. President Barack Obama's administration recently defended its use of unmanned drones to target suspected terrorists overseas in a rare public statement, with John Brennan, the president's top counterterrorism adviser, saying the strikes are conducted ""in full accordance with the law."" The program uses unmanned aerial vehicles, often equipped with Hellfire missiles, to target suspected terrorists in remote locations overseas, with many such strikes occurring in Yemen and Pakistan, despite internal opposition to the practice within the latter country. Brennan said the United States ""respects national sovereignty and international law"" and is guided by the laws of war in ordering those attacks. The Pakistani border area is widely believed to be the operating base for the Haqqani network and other militant groups that have attacked international troops in neighboring Afghanistan. CNN's Pam Benson, Barbara Starr, Reza Sayah and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: Some jihadists do not believe the report, SITE says .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to taking spirited vacations, wandering a vineyard falls flat in the face of handcrafted brew. With more than 1,500 breweries across the United States, beer is not just a drink -- it's a destination. Wooden barrels of beer are just part of the draw at The Lost Abbey Brewery in San Diego, California. ""What's happened is that the old world has influenced the new world; the U.S. is now a travel destination for beer, [even] for people from outside of the country,"" said Julia Herz, craft beer program director at the Brewers Association. ""What's so great about beer is that you have this range,"" said Randy Mosher, author of ""Tasting Beer: An Insider's Guide to the World's Best Drink."" ""It's from 3 percent alcohol to 20 percent, from super malty to very hoppy, and then you throw in stuff like fruit, spices -- you have an enormous range of possibilities."" With such a wide flavor profile, said Stephen Beaumont, author of ""Premium Drinker's Beer Guide,"" beer travel is less about hanging out at the brewery and more about the tasting. In other words, don't look just for an incredible brewer, but also for an incredible city in which to drink beer. Although it's a highly contested question that Herz calls ""fodder for late-night philosophical conversations,"" there are a few brew towns that these beer aficionados identify as the cream of the hops. Eat, drink and brew local . If you didn't know that Portland, Oregon, is synonymous with ""Beervana,"" then you clearly need an introduction to the beer scene. ""In a lot of ways, [it's] a very highly developed town for craft beer,"" Mosher said. The city has a reputation for going local, and Portland thoroughly applies that philosophy to brewing. ""When you live in Portland, you become entrenched in the whole hops and malts [thing] because you're living right where it's being produced,"" said Portland resident Angelo De Ieso of beer site Brewpublic.com. Thirty percent of the world's hops come from the Pacific Northwest and Idaho, De Ieso said. The other major pull is the ""high concentration of breweries,"" Beaumont said. ""Portland is a fairly small compact area, [but] they've got a free transit system, and they've got brewpubs chockablock."" Higgins Restaurant and Bar is a great place to get advice on navigating the local beer scene, according to Beaumont. And while you're there, you can sample their impressive beer list including Oregon-bottled Rogue Morimoto Imperial Pilsner and The Bruery's ""Trade Winds"" Triple out of California, a brewer that Beaumont notes is ""up-and-coming, doing phenomenal stuff."" As for breweries, De Ieso said ""the one that really stands out is Upright Brewery with their Belgian farmhouse style beers."" Another stop has to be Hopworks Urban Brewery, an all-organic brewpub fully powered with renewable energy. ""They do a lot of the standard styles of Northwest beers, like the IPA, which is our flagship beer,"" De Ieso said. Try the signature Hopworks IPA for a taste of Pacific Northwest flavor. SoCal brew style . Much further south, in San Diego, California, you'll find what Beaumont calls ""a hotbed of innovation,"" where the beer tends ""to be a little stronger, with more alcohol."" And while ""all of California could be considered the state from which the innovators of craft beer came, San Diego specifically grabbed the golden ring from the merry go round and ran with it,"" said Matt Simpson, a craft beer consultant. So when you're talking San Diego-style beer, for most beer geeks you're talking about The Lost Abbey. ""The most notable guy right now is Tomme Arthur at Lost Abbey. He was one of the early adventurous brewers in Southern California,"" beer tasting expert Mosher said. Known for Belgian-style beers and a ""flavor first"" philosophy, beer expert Beaumont said ""they're doing some really innovative, interesting stuff in terms of barrel aging and unusual fermentations, beyond basic brewers yeast."" Beer experts also fawn over AleSmith, a microbrewery that has been pumping out diverse, high quality ales since 1995. ""The special beers that they do are astounding, if not sublime,"" Simpson said. ""They do a barrel-aged series, and those beers are limited to 250 bottles or less, so you can imagine the supply and demand market for them."" Flavors of the South . Although other beer lovers often skip over the South because of restrictive brewing laws in some areas, Simpson insisted that some of the best brew can be found below the Mason-Dixon line. ""One of my top three is North Carolina, with Asheville being the center of that. Not only is it a really fun place to visit, they make amazing beers,"" he said. ""There's Foothills, a brewpub that has a breakout hit called Sexual Chocolate, an imperial stout that put them on the map of craft beer."" Simpson also touts his home stomping grounds, Atlanta, Georgia. ""We have one of the top five beer bars in the world in the Brick Store Pub, across the board,"" Simpson said. ""You can go to Greatbeers.com, Ratebeer.com, Beeradvocate.com -- they're rating the Brick Store Pub as one of the top beer bars in the world. And if you're here for a few days you can hit breweries like Sweetwater, 5 Seasons, and Twain's."" Whether your drink town of choice is San Diego or Philadelphia, San Francisco or Boston, Beaumont recommends chatting up locals for clues on the local beer scene. ""Beer is a social drink, and beer people love to talk about the beer,"" he said. ""You can find a local or savvy visitor who can tell you about something you've never heard of, and that makes it a phenomenal experience.""","Craft beer has turned popular brewing towns into travel destinations .
Experts say Oregon, California and North Carolina offer some great brews .
Wherever you go, make sure to talk to locals to get insider brewpub suggestions ."
"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- A car bomb Thursday rocked a southern suburb of Lebanon's capital -- an area known as a stronghold of the Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah, the Lebanese Army said. Eighteen people were killed and 291 were wounded, the Lebanese national news agency NNA reported. Video shown on Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV showed fierce flames engulfing several cars in the Beirut suburb. Thick, black smoke rose from the vehicles; a nearby building also appeared to be on fire. Ambulances were rushing to the site of the blast, NNA reported. ""Army units arrived immediately at the scene, enforcing a security zone within the area of explosion while military experts initiated investigations under the concerned judiciary's surveillance,"" the army said. After the blast, a YouTube video surfaced in which three masked men holding weapons claimed they are part of a group responsible for the attack. They stood before a large Arabic sign containing the Islamic creed, ""There is no God but Allah, and Mohammed is the messenger of Allah."" The group, which calls itself ""The brigade of Aisha, Mother of Believers,"" accused Hezbollah of being aggressors. Aisha is the last wife of the Prophet Muhammad and is especially revered by Sunni Muslims. In its YouTube post, the group called Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah a ""pig"" and said he works on behalf of Iran and Israel. ""A message: To our brothers and sisters in Lebanon: Stay away from anything to do with Iran -- whether in Beirut or outside Beirut,"" it said. Hezbollah is a Shiite movement in Lebanon. Along with Shiite-dominated Iran, the group is helping Syria's government fight rebels, whose ranks are dominated by Sunnis. CNN could not confirm the authenticity of the video or the men's claims. The U.S. Embassy in Beirut tweeted condemnations of the attack. Civil Defense units were trying to rescue some citizens stuck inside their homes due to the fire resulting from the blast, NNA reported. The explosion comes about a month after a car bomb injured dozens of people in the pro-Hezbollah neighborhood of Bir El Abed, located in a southern Beirut suburb. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom reported from Beirut, Lebanon. CNN's Yasmin Amer reported from Atlanta.","NEW: 18 killed, 291 wounded, state news says .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Three suspected drone strikes Monday killed 21 people in a volatile northwest Pakistani tribal region that borders Afghanistan, two Pakistani intelligence officials told CNN. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media, said all 21 were militants. However, witnesses told CNN affiliate GEO-TV at the scene that among the dead were seven civilians. CNN cannot independently confirm either account. A suspected drone fired at two alleged militant hideoutsin South Waziristan, one of the seven districts of Pakistan's volatile tribal region bordering Afghanistan. It was the second such series of strikes since Friday in the same area, officials said. Four missiles struck two hideouts in the village of Wacha Dana, killing nine insurgents in one attack and eight in another, said the officials, . A fifth missile struck a vehicle being driven by a suspected militant near the village of Shawal, the officials said. The United States does not comment on suspected drone strikes. But it is the only country in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from drones -- which are controlled remotely. Based on a count by CNN's Islamabad bureau, Monday's suspected drone strike was the 31st this year, compared to 111 in all of 2010. The U.S. contends insurgents routinely launch attacks from the Pakistani tribal region into Afghanistan, crossing the border to resupply militants with money and weapons.","NEW: The suspected drone strike hits a vehicle and two hideouts in Pakistan's South Waziristan .

"(CNN) -- As U.S. President Barack Obama stood in Berlin on Wednesday to propose deep cuts in U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons arsenals, Pentagon war planners were working to make these weapons more accurate and deadly. The Air Force told Congress this year it plans to put nuclear cruise missiles on board stealthy B-2 bombers for the first time. Currently, only the half-century-old B-52 bombers carry these weapons. The Air Force also plans to add a new and improved cruise missile to the mix. Nuclear ""gravity bombs"" -- the ones that are designed to be dropped out of planes -- will be getting some help too. The Pentagon is moving ahead with plans to install sophisticated new tails that will improve their accuracy. Can the United States maintain its current level of nuclear security with fewer nuclear weapons -- if the weapons are more accurate? Related: Obama says let's cut some nukes . For nuclear weapons analyst Michaela Dodge of the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, the answer is no. It's all about targeting, she says. Having fewer weapons allows fewer possible targets. According to Dodge, having fewer weapons to reach the same or increased number of targets is bad. With lower numbers of nukes, the U.S. won't have enough weapons to cover military targets in Russia, China and elsewhere, she says. As an alternative, war planners will be forced to consider shifting targets toward civilian populations. ""That is just not a good idea,"" she says, adding that it brings new ethical and moral choices into play. Nuclear weapons: Who has what? Dodge says the U.S. needs to remain at current nuclear weapons levels to keep the playing field even. Other nuclear powers, including Russia, have been increasing their arsenals, Dodge says. As for China, Dodge says the Pentagon doesn't know exactly how many nuclear weapons Beijing has, because ""China has a very extensive tunnel network where they can build and store nuclear weapons. ... We're talking about thousands of miles of tunnels."" From a moral standpoint, improving nuclear platforms while proposing weapons cuts appears disingenous to some, including nuclear weapons analyst Hans Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists. The Obama administration is using delivery systems to improve the military capability of the nation's nuclear arsenal. He says that's undercutting the spirit of the president's promise to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in national strategy. As for Wednesday's proposed cuts, Kristensen welcomes Obama's proposal, but he says, ""offloading 500 warheads from missiles will not destroy a single warhead, nor does it reduce the total arsenals of the United States and Russia, who have 4,650 and 4,500 warheads, respectively, in their military stockpiles."" This ain't your Cold War strategizing, say experts. Preventing the use of nuclear weapons nowadays is much more complicated than it was in the days when Washington and Moscow kept things peaceful thanks to the idea of ""mutually assured destruction."" The landscape is different. For example, the prickly relationship between Pakistan and India has a nuclear component. North Korea now poses a huge nuclear question mark. One of the biggest fears for many world leaders involves terrorists getting their hands on a nuclear weapon. What hasn't changed much is the horrifying damage these things leave behind after the mushroom cloud blows away. ""Only nuclear weapons produce radioactive fallout that can cause cancers, birth defects, and genetic damage for decades after they are used,"" according to the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War. With the Cold War in our rearview mirror, ""it's very unlikely we would get into a shooting war with Russia,"" Kristensen says. ""Politically we're moving away from that situation. But militarily the two countries are still holding on to these arsenals because they can see what the other country has. Predominantly the U.S. and the Russians have high numbers of weapons because we have high numbers of weapons. So there's a sort of self-fulfilling prophesy in that. It drives itself."" So, why put nuclear cruise missiles on the B-2 bomber? Experts say the B-2's radar-evading stealth design would more effectively penetrate hostile airspace than the larger, slower, less agile B-52. The B-52 has been toting nukes since the dawn of the Cold War. By the time it's scheduled to retire in 2040, its career will have stretched an incredible 80 years. Experts fear that B-52s can more easily be brought down by surface-to-air missiles. ""You don't want to fly B-52s over anything but tribal militias these days,"" Christopher Ford of the Hudson Institute told Global Security News Wire. ""That's a good way to lose B-52s."" Whatever the case, America is moving forward with a new generation of nuclear weapons. The current mainstay of America's nuclear cruise missiles -- the AGM-86B -- is getting old. It was deployed in the 1980s. The U.S. says it has about 1,100 of these atomic hammers. They measure about 20 feet long, weigh 3,100 pounds and boast a range of more than 1,500 miles. And they can blow through the sky at a speed of 550 mph. In 2007, the U.S. retired a stealthy Advanced Cruise Missile, as part of a U.S.-Russian weapons reduction agreement, according to the Federation of American Scientists. Now, the Air Force is developing another stealthy nuke cruiser, which it recently described in its 2014 proposed budget as ""capable of surviving and penetrating advanced"" air defense. By the mid-2020s, if all goes according to the Air Force plan, new generation nuclear cruise missiles will be deployed aboard a new U.S. aircraft that -- for now -- is generically referred to as the Long Range Strike Bomber. Big changes are in the works on many levels across the nuclear weapons landscape. Regardless of your point of view, it's in everyone's interest to pay attention.","Obama proposes negotiated nuclear weapons cuts with Russia .

"(CNN) -- It seems that in at least one part of the world, the golden arches have lost a little luster. The reason lies in a proposal by U.S.-based fast food giant McDonald's to build a restaurant in Tecoma, a small Australian town in the lush foothills of the Dandenong Ranges east of Melbourne. The corporation's move has sparked a two-year battle with locals, who say they resent the influx of an international restaurant chain and feel that the restaurant will spoil an area of outstanding natural beauty. Under the banner ""No Maccas in Tecoma,"" residents of the town of 2,000 have held several protests against the proposed restaurant, such as the one depicted in this iReport in early March, shot by Tim Smith and sent in by resident Kerry Furnell. Why such anger over one burger joint? The reasons are manifold, says campaigner Garry Muratore. iReport: Tecoma says no to McDonald's . ""For me, personally, I will be living only 400 meters from the proposed development, so the issues were litter and traffic,"" he said. ""For young families, it is the fact that it will be built almost opposite a primary school and kindergarten. For the local doctors, it's about health, while others are concerned it will be only 800 meters from a national park."" McDonald's, which says it has kept in regular contact with the local media, community and interested parties over the restaurant plans, has 780 restaurants across Australia, employing about 85,000 people. Amongst the values listed on its website is the promise ""we give back to our communities."" A spokeswoman for McDonald's said in a statement that it had been ""diligent"" in addressing concerns of the community, altering the external design of the restaurant to reflect ""the aesthetic of the area"" and consulting third-party traffic engineers to ensure minimal impact. Furnell said that the Dandenong Ranges were an iconic place for Australians and that many were ""horrified"" McDonald's could think such a development would be appropriate. She also said increased traffic, vandalism and crime might affect her children. ""The presence of a 24-hour restaurant will mean (an) increase of littering, vandalism and worse and the leaving of items such as used condoms or broken bottles, meaning children are more likely to be injured or harmed in some way,"" she said. For a small campaign, its reach has been extraordinary. Campaigners have been quick to engage in a PR war, harnessing the power of social media, developing a website punningly titled Burger Off to promote their cause and creating a Facebook page with almost 6,000 likes. More than 75 local volunteers have also pitched in, with one academic spending eight weeks wading through three years worth of local newspapers in the state library to tally up incidents of crime purportedly involving McDonald's restaurants. McDonald's changes its name to ""Maccas"" in some Australian restaurants . Others have helped with fundraising, developed contacts with similar campaigns across Australia or attended peaceful occupations of the proposed site, where a community garden was built. In February, protesters held a garden gnome ""invasion"" of the McDonald's headquarters in Collingwood, a Melbourne suburb, where hundreds of the garden ornaments were placed on the office steps. But despite an increasingly fraught battle on both sides, campaigners have stressed that it is the corporation and its franchise holders they have an issue with, not staffers, who they say are just doing their job. What they are angry about is what they describe as a lack of dialogue. ""(McDonald's) say they look forward to engaging with us, so we say come and meet, and they won't return our calls,"" Muratore said. ""They speak with both sides of their mouth."" The McDonald's statement said the company was ""proud to contribute to the local community everywhere we operate"" through creating jobs, offering training opportunities and providing financial benefits to local businesses and sporting clubs through sponsorships. ""We have absolutely followed established legal processes to ensure that the restaurant is afforded the same rights and privileges as any other business looking to settle in the area,"" the spokeswoman said. It is not the first time such a burger battle has been fought on Australian soil. In 2011, a proposal by McDonald's to build a fourth restaurant in Port Macquarie, north of Sydney, was rejected by the Land and Environment Court, local media reported. Residents had argued that the site was in a residential area and was an environmental concern. In Tecoma, after councilors initially rejected the plan, McDonald's appealed to a planning court. In September, the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal found in favor of McDonald's, and the Tecoma campaigners say they do not have the funds to take the case to the Supreme Court. After months of court battles, site occupations, meetings, allegations and counterallegations, the original McDonald's franchisee backed out of the project this month. A new one has stepped in, but the small success has emboldened the protesters, who feel that victory in this battle could lead to winning the overall war. ""It's a case of dollars over democracy, and that's the heart of any issue that involves communities and large businesses,"" Muratore said. ""Our community is not a cookie-cutter suburb; it's unique. All those on the campaign want the same: We don't want a multinational fast food outlet.""","Small town near Melbourne, Australia, has fought McDonald's plans for two years .

"(Financial Times) -- A survey of Ryanair pilots has found concerns about the low-cost carrier's safety culture, and support for an inquiry by regulators. Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline by revenue, declined to comment on the survey on Sunday, but said it had an ""unblemished 29-year safety record"". The survey was commissioned by the Ryanair Pilot Group, which is seeking to have the airline's pilots represented by trade unions in negotiations on pay and working conditions. It contacted more than 1,000 captains and first officers at Ryanair -- more than one-third of the total number of pilots at the company. The survey was prompted by a warning in April by Ray Conway, Ryanair's chief pilot and a senior manager, that any pilot signing a petition -- organised by the Ryanair Pilot Group and calling on regulators to evaluate whether the company's employment model had an impact on the safety of flight operations -- would be liable for dismissal. Of those participating in the survey, 89 per cent said that, following this memorandum from Mr Conway, they did not consider that Ryanair had an open and transparent safety culture. Mr Conway said in his memo that any pilot who had legitimate safety concerns should raise them through Ryanair's confidential safety reporting channel or with the Irish Aviation Authority. The survey found that 67 per cent did not feel comfortable raising safety issues through Ryanair's internal reporting system. It also found 94 per cent believed regulators should conduct an inquiry into the impact of Ryanair's employment practices on safety. Evert van Zwol, chairman of the Ryanair Pilot Group's interim council, said it had a ""strong suspicion"" that the airline's employment practices may be affecting flight safety, but had no proof, which explained why an inquiry was warranted by regulators. He added a majority of Ryanair's pilots were not employed directly but instead hired through agencies, and expressed concerns about their terms and conditions, saying many have so-called zero-hours contracts where there are no guaranteed working hours. ""The results of the survey are reason for very great concern and call for immediate action [by] all involved parties, to get working on a solution and lowering these [survey] percentages sharply down,"" said Mr van Zwol. Ryanair said it would not comment on the Ryanair Pilot Group or its survey, which is due to be outlined in a Channel 4 ""Dispatches"" programme on Monday. It also would not comment on whether any of its pilots were on zero-hours contracts. Ryanair's 2013 annual report said safety is the company's ""primary priority"", starting with the hiring and training of its pilots, flight attendants and maintenance staff. Employees earn productivity-based incentive payments, including some for pilots based on their number of flying hours. But the annual report said Ryanair pilots are subject to limits of 900 flying hours each financial year, as determined by Irish regulators. It added the average number of flying hours by pilots in 2013 was approximately 798 -- a 5 per cent decline compared to 2012. © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline by revenue, declined to comment on the survey on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- ""The Real World"" has now been on TV for longer than some of MTV's viewers have been alive. Having aired 532 episodes filmed in 21 cities over 26 seasons, ""The Real World"" celebrates its 20th anniversary this week. Despite being one of the longest-running reality programs on TV, it seems viewers still aren't sick of seeing ""what happens ... when people stop being polite ... and start getting real."" The September 2011 premiere of the series' most recent season, ""The Real World: San Diego,"" drew nearly 2 million viewers. Clocking in as the No. 1 original cable series of the night, the premiere marked the show's best debut in five seasons, according to TV by the Numbers. But ""The Real World's"" cultural significance extends far beyond the number of people who tune in these days. ""'The Real World' was definitely the first show to put people into a house to live together,"" said Jonathan Murray, co-creator and executive producer of the series. It also introduced the ""confessional"" -- a room where cast members can go to speak directly into the camera and comment on their actions, Murray said. CBS' ""Big Brother,"" which began airing in the United States in 2000, borrowed ""The Real World's"" format, adding a competitive element. Even MTV's shinier and newer reality program, ""Jersey Shore,"" which attracted between 4 million and 7 million viewers throughout its fifth season, can attribute some of its success to the long-running series. ""We've seen certain shows like 'Newlyweds' or 'The Osbournes' or 'Jersey Shore' come along, and somehow, 'The Real World' keeps coming back while some of those other shows have their super bright nova in the sky,"" Murray said. The show had somewhat humble beginnings. A 2007 USA Today story noted that MTV originally wanted the series to have a soap opera-feel. Then MTV chief Brian Graden told the publication that the show is ""quite simply the undisputed granddaddy of modern, commercial reality television."" Murray says the same things that originally made the series such a dark horse, including featuring a new cast and location each season, are what inevitably led to ""The Real World's"" longevity. ""The fact that we do change the cast every season, and we do change the location,"" he said, ""it keeps it fresh and it allows the show to very much reflect what's in the minds of young people."" In some ways the show was groundbreaking. In 1994's ""The Real World: San Francisco,"" cast member Pedro Zamora shared his struggle with HIV/AIDS. After Zamora died in November 1994, President Bill Clinton said the Cuban-born reality star ""changed the face of HIV and AIDS in America forever."" ""'San Francisco' was just, for most of us who've worked on the show, an incredibly important season because of Pedro's involvement,"" Murray said, adding, Zamora's story took ""The Real World"" out of the entertainment section and placed it on the front page. That season, the series' third, is when Murray said he knew ""The Real World"" was special. He said he remembers thinking, ""Maybe we'll get another five seasons."" Since then, the show has tackled a number of previously taboo issues. Perhaps one of the series' most memorable cast members, Ruthie Alcaide, appeared on season eight, ""The Real World: Hawaii."" Alcaide's drinking problem, which eventually resulted in her temporarily leaving the show to enter a rehab center, shed a light on how young people cope with substance abuse, Murray said. ""The show, from the very beginning, was built on the idea that we were going to put seven diverse people into a house together,"" Murray said. ""And so, the DNA of the show has always been diversity. ... And over the years, we've explored that diversity in every way possible."" Murray's current goal is to make it to 30 seasons, which is just around the corner considering that the 27th season, ""The Real World: St. Thomas"" is set to air on MTV this summer. And he said a 28th season has already been ordered. ""What's amazing about 'The Real World' is that every four years, in a sense, a new audience grows up into it,"" Murray said, adding that he always hears people say things like, ""'That Vegas season was the best (yet),' and they've never even heard of that first Vegas season (which premiered in 2002) with Trishelle (Cannatella)."" But Murray's biggest fear isn't that the series won't hit its silver anniversary: ""I'm scared for the day that we actually have someone apply to be on the show who's the son or daughter of someone who has been on the show.""","Having aired 532 episodes, ""The Real World"" celebrates its 20th anniversary this week .

"(CNN) -- The Oxford English Dictionary has finally gotten around to acknowledging that tweeting isn't just for the birds. In its latest update, the dictionary that describes itself as ""the accepted authority on the evolution of the English language over the last millennium"" has revamped the entry for ""tweet"" to include its social networking usage. Although the move may seem behind the curve given the widespread use of ""tweet"" to refer to activity on Twitter, the dictionary's chief editor says he's actually broken one of its rules by including it so soon. ""A new word needs to be current for ten years before consideration for inclusion,"" John Simpson wrote on the dictionary's website. ""But it seems to be catching on."" The dictionary's entry for tweet now includes the verb -- ""to make a posting on the social networking service Twitter"" -- and the noun -- ""a posting made on the social networking service Twitter."" They sit alongside the well established bird-related definitions of the word, whose traces go as far back as the 16th century, according to the dictionary. By recognizing that people can tweet, too, the main Oxford English Dictionary is playing catch up with its smaller, snappier cousin, the Concise Oxford English Dictionary. The concise dictionary, a different product that seeks to be ""progressive and up to date,"" already included the word ""retweet"" -- meaning to repost or forward a message posted by another user on Twitter -- in its 12th edition in 2011. But the mother dictionary, which began life in the 19th century and contains information on more than 600,000 words, tends to move more cautiously in adding and revising entries, something it does four times a year. It has nonetheless ingested several new tech-related words in this month's update, along with ""tweet."" They include ""big data,"" ""crowdsourcing,"" ""e-reader"" and ""mouseover."" And in a belated nod to 1990s pop culture, the dictionary has also just added the Bart Simpson catchphrase ""to have a cow."" Simpson -- the dictionary's editor, not the cartoon character -- points out that while Bart made the slang term popular, its use can be traced back to 1959. That means it took more than half a century to find its way into the dictionary's pages, a far longer journey than the rapid rise of the non-avian ""tweet."" It's settled!

"(CNN) -- [Breaking news update 2:20 a.m. ET ] The hostage standoff in St. Joseph, Louisiana, has ended with the hostage taker dead, police said. The two hostages were getting medical treatment. [Original story ] One bank employee was freed, while two of her colleagues remained held at gunpoint Tuesday night inside a rural Louisiana bank, as a slew of law enforcement manned positions and worked for a peaceful resolution. The woman's negotiated release came about eight hours into the standoff at Tensas State Bank's branch in St. Joseph, Louisiana, a town of about 1,200 people in northeastern Louisiana. State Police Col. Michael Edmonson described her going free as a ""positive,"" while noting that the situation remains tense and dangerous. ""It's a fluid, active scene,"" Edmonson told reporters around 9 p.m. (10 p.m. ET). ""We still have two hostages in there."" The ordeal began around 12:30 p.m., when a 20-year-old man entered the bank branch in St. Joseph with a handgun, apparently intent on robbing it, according to officials. For whatever reason, he ended up staying there and taking three bank employees, two women and one man, hostage. Edmonson said he wasn't sure ""what statement (the suspect) was trying to make or (if) something ... just went bad,"" adding there was ""no reason for him to want these particular individuals in the bank."" Born in California, the hostage-taker moved with his family to northeastern Louisiana, where his family owns a convenience store, Edmonson said. The Mississippi River community of St. Joseph -- which is located about 35 miles south of Tallulah, Louisiana, and 35 miles north of Natchez, Mississippi -- is the parish seat of Tensas Parish, which has about 5,000 people. After word got out about the hostage situation, local, state and federal law enforcement agents descended on the quiet community. Law enforcement agents have been able to talk to the hostages. They also spoke with the gunman, who Edmonson said ""has made some demands of us."" He did not elaborate. ""We're walking through those, we're trying to talk to him very calm,"" the police colonel said. ""... We believe (the hostages) to be safe. We know him to be armed."" Authorities were interviewing the freed female hostage, according to Edmonson. They'll also provide ""food and provisions"" for the other two captives, as well as the man holding them. ""We're going to stay here as long as it takes,"" the police colonel said. ""Our No. 1 goal is to make sure that those (hostages) come out of there safely, and (we'll do) whatever it takes to do that."" Authorities shut down part of the road where the bank is located in St. Joseph, but otherwise all traffic in the town is moving, said parish homeland security spokeswoman Jane Netterville. She denied rumors that there may be explosives involved, saying ""there are no confirmed bomb threats at this time."" Edmonson said he talked to, and prayed with, relatives of the hostages and that some of the suspect's relatives have tried to approach the area. Asked earlier Tuesday by CNN what she'd tell the gunman, Netterville said, ""I would say, 'Let the people go, just let them go.'"" ""'Don't harm anyone. Whatever your situation is, you're better off if you just let the hostages go and then let us deal with you, in whatever way we'll deal with you.'""

"(CNN) -- About six years ago, the hottest name on a Web site set up by retiring Delta pilots was Marcus Schrenker. Michael Kinney, a Georgia dentist, says he was duped by financial manager Marcus Schrenker. ""We had this site so we could all talk to each other for advice on retirement options, company news and mainly what to do with our money,"" said Joe Mazzone, 57. The Auburn, Alabama, pilot was looking for the right person to invest the nest egg he and his wife had spent decades growing. ""Go with Marcus, that's what I kept seeing. You could trust this guy. He was a pilot, and he understood us,"" said Mazzone, who gave Schrenker several hundred thousand dollars. ""Talk about a regret."" Schrenker was found Tuesday night at a Florida campground with deep cuts to his wrists in an apparent suicide attempt. He had been on the run from federal authorities for three days. The 38-year-old Indiana financial adviser is accused of trying to fake his death Sunday by making a bogus call to air traffic controllers that the window on his six-seater plane, which he scheduled to fly from Indiana to Destin, Florida, had imploded and he was bleeding, police say. Schrenker had actually switched the plane to autopilot and parachuted out of the aircraft. The Piper PA-46 crashed in the swamps of Milton, Florida, not far from homes. No one on the ground was hurt. Schrenker has been charged with unlawful acts by a compensated adviser and unlawful transaction by an investment adviser. He could face more federal charges. He is being guarded at a Tallahassee, Florida, hospital, and the court has issued an arrest warrant and set bail at $4 million cash. It's unclear if Schrenker has retained a lawyer.  Watch how the case unfolded » . In the months before the alleged stunt, the state of Indiana was investigating Schrenker on fraud allegations, and a Maryland court issued a $500,000 judgment against a company listed in his name. His wife had filed for divorce on December 30. On Monday, a judge in Indiana froze Schrenker's assets, as well as his wife's assets, said Jim Gavin, a spokesman for the Indiana secretary of state. ""Marcus caused such difficulty in our family, so to look up and see his life, as bad as it apparently was, falling apart on national TV, well it was quite something,"" said Elsie Reese, whose 85-year-old husband Thomas Reese is named in an Indiana state complaint alleging Schrenker defrauded them. ""He needs to take this time to come to grips with what's he's done, that he's lied and cheated and been dishonest,"" she said. ""I prayed for him this morning."" The Reese family and others heard about Schrenker through word-of-mouth among a small and trusted inner circle of commercial pilots. Those CNN spoke with used the same words to describe the money manager: Young, handsome, confident, smooth talking. A picture making media rounds this week shows Schrenker standing in front of a silver Mercedes. Next to him is his petite blonde wife. Schrenker appreciated the power of the first impression, investors say. ""His modus operandi is, he flies into your city dressed up in a thousand-dollar suit and sits down with you, buys you lunch, and the next thing you know, he has you on his side and you move your money to his Heritage Wealth Management,"" Mazzone said. Schrenker kept his clients' doubts and complaints at bay with gifts including free airplane trips and artwork, Mazzone said. Schrenker gave him two $1,000 aviation headsets, he said. ""He once offered to fly from Indiana to where I live in Alabama and pick me up to take me to Chicago to look at an airplane I was thinking about buying,"" Mazzone said. ""I'm thinking, 'Wow, this guy is willing to spend his time and all that money in fuel just to help me out?' "" That kind of over-the-top gesture helped build Schrenker's reputation in the late 1990s as the go-to guy among pilots who wanted to invest their savings, retired pilot Charles Kinney said.   He met Schrenker in 1996 through another pilot and forged a friendship that lasted more than a decade. Around 2003, Kinney suggested that his parents and his brother, Michael Kinney, a Georgia dentist, consider letting Schrenker manage their money. Schrenker told Kinney's parents that their money was going to ""various insurance products"" even though Kinney said it was never really clear what Schrenker meant. His parents handed over $2 million in assets. ""He said this is a safe place to put money, to avoid all the world's dangers like terrorism and impending doom and gloom associated with it,"" Kinney said. ""In that climate, back then, you bought it. You believed him that he would protect your money."" It would be easy for the average person to fall for Schrenker's pitch, Michael Kinney said. ""Good talking, slick tongue, very intelligent sounding,"" he said. ""Now, once you know what he's talking about, then you know that a lot of what he says makes no sense. But if you don't know what he's talking about -- if you don't know these products fairly well as I do now -- then boy, it sounds pretty good. ""I have never in my life seen anybody that could tell dishonest untruths that he told over and over again and expect you to believe him,"" Michael Kinney said. ""I guess that's one thing that caught me by surprise in my dealings with him. I've never dealt with anybody with that level of dishonesty."" Charles Kinney feels deeply betrayed.   ""To find that someone you would basically call a cousin is robbing you and lying to you blind? It's staggering,"" he said. ""I have no sympathy for him."" The Kinneys, Reeses and Mazzones told CNN they suspected numerous times that Schrenker wasn't being honest. They were suspicious when Schrenker told them they would receive only one statement a year describing returns.   Charles Kinney and Joe Mazzone said Schrenker promised to send them contracts which they say they never received. ""I called him up every time I had a doubt, and he was able to give me a plausible explanation,"" Kinney said. Although he often had nagging feelings that he should stop doing business with Schrenker, Mazzone ignored them. ""Marcus just had an explanation for everything, and so I just went with it, trusted him,"" he said.   The men said Schrenker assured them he was not making commissions on their investments and the pilots and their families would receive only one statement each year showing returns.   ""Turns out he was making 12 to 18 percent commissions on $100,000 annuities,"" Mazzone said. Eventually, the investors returned to where many of them first heard about Schrenker -- online. They began posting messages in a chat room asking if anyone else had been having trouble with the businessman. Soon, investors were sharing emails and documents with the group. ""It was pretty clear we'd all had similar experiences,"" said Charles Kinney. The group filed complaints in Georgia and Indiana about Schrenker in 2007. ""This was a process of wading through a creek and slowly turning over rocks,"" he said. ""And every time it's a shock and a fabrication and a lie."" CNN's Kathleen Johnston and Drew Griffin contributed to this report.","Retired pilots are among investors allegedly duped by businessman .

"(CNN) -- The boyfriend of a 16-year-old, pregnant Texas girl who says her parents tried to force her to have an abortion told CNN on Monday that the couple never considered terminating the pregnancy. ""We were always determined to have the baby,"" Evan Madison told CNN's Piers Morgan. The parents of the girl, who is 10 weeks pregnant, agreed Monday in a state court not to coerce her to have an abortion, an anti-abortion group representing the girl said. ""We just achieved an agreed order,"" Stephen Casey, a lawyer and founder of The Texas Center for Defense of Life, told CNN in a telephone interview Monday afternoon. Casey had argued that Roe v. Wade, the historic 1973 Supreme Court decision that guaranteed women the right to have an abortion, works both ways. ""Roe was about the right to choose,"" Casey told CNN prior to the order being signed. ""This young woman has the right to choose to have her child."" Legal experts said that no one can force anyone, minor or not, to undergo an abortion. Monday's legal action was intended, the girl's lawyer said, to stop the parents from trying to influence their daughter to undergo the procedure. Madison, 16, said he and the girl plan to get married. The legal age to marry in Texas is 16 with parental consent. Both teens were in the courtroom on Monday. They sat separately from the girl's parents, who are divorced. The girl lives with her mother. The parents have denied the allegations in the lawsuit and called the case baseless. Their attorney did not respond to requests from CNN for comment. The center, which is active in Republican politics nationwide, says it is dedicated to ""aggressively defending the sanctity of human life."" The lawyers were first contacted by the boy's mother, who said that the girl's parents were threatening both teens, according to Casey, who said the center then contacted the girl and offered their services gratis. The lawsuit alleged that the girl's mother threatened to ""slip (the teen) an abortion pill,"" took her daughter's phone and car and kept her home from school to punish her for choosing not to abort her fetus. The mother told the teen that she was ""making the biggest mistake of her life"" by choosing to have the child and that the mother herself had undergone numerous abortions, so her daughter should, too, the lawsuit said. It added that the pregnant girl's father told her he ""was going to look into canceling"" her health insurance. He texted his daughter that she ""needs an ass whoopin',"" the document said. The parents told their daughter she could ""continue to live in misery"" in their home or she could ""have the abortion and tell everyone it was a miscarriage,"" the lawsuit added. The girl's parents denied in court records all allegations and asked to have the cost of retaining an attorney reimbursed. That request was not granted. In the interest of protecting the girl's privacy, CNN is not identifying her or her parents. However, the restraining order includes the parents' names. ""Under Texas procedure when it's a case involving and alleging abuse of a minor, the minor's identity should be protected, and the girl's attorneys might have violated that,"" said Susan Hays, an attorney and legal adviser to Jane's Due Process, an Austin-based nonprofit organization that represents pregnant minors in the state. Jane's Due Process, which supports the right to legal abortion, is not involved in this case. ""There's an understanding that we will not make law on the back of a 16-year-old girl, and that's what her attorneys are doing,"" said Hays. ""I'm appalled that they've done this to this girl. Putting the girl's parents' names in court documents ... her attorneys have done a lousy job protecting her confidentiality."" Hays said the lawyers could have used the parents' initials or included less detail about the family. Casey responded that the courts had notified child protective services about the abuse allegations. Last year Casey's group represented a 14-year-old from Corpus Christi who said her family wanted to force her to have an abortion. The girl didn't want to abort the fetus, Casey said, and her grandmother and cousins were allegedly abusive to the teen. The lawyer in that case, which was settled and a confidential agreement reached, did not disclose the girl's name, Casey said. He would not say whether the girl had an abortion.

"Washington (CNN) -- The early favorite to win the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination walks a tightrope. Hillary Clinton has said she is in no hurry to decide whether she'll seek the White House. But the former secretary of state, first lady and senator stokes the assumption that she's in the game for a second time with every move she makes. Such status raises a question: how much time does someone in her position want to spend in the limelight at such an early stage and with no indication she will even run? Clinton jumps back into fray with speech on voting rights . After years immersed in foreign affairs as America's top diplomat, Clinton has begun to reemerge on the public stage. She is starting to carefully weigh in on domestic issues and devote more time to her family's foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative. She jumped into highly charged political issues on race in a speech on Monday in San Francisco -- sharply criticizing efforts to roll back the Voting Rights Act as well the Republican-led drive in some states to require voter identification. ""Not every obstacle is related to race, but anyone who says that racial discrimination is no longer a problem in American elections must not be paying attention,"" Clinton said in her remarks to a group of fellow lawyers. ""And despite the best efforts of many well-intentioned election officials, discrepancies and resources across precincts and polling stations still disproportionately affect African-American, Latino, and young voters."" Weiner says he knows wife's role with Clinton in 2016 . For Clinton, her appearance before the American Bar Association raised a few more eyebrows and is seen as a sign of things to come. â€¢ She announced in Monday's remarks that she would deliver a string of policy speeches in the coming months, including one in September on national security. â€¢ Clinton is also writing a memoir due to be released in 2014. â€¢ Next month, Clinton will host a fundraiser at her Washington home for Terry McAuliffe, a close family friend, mega-fundraiser, and the Democratic nominee for governor in the presidential battleground of Virginia. All of this -- the political stances, the fundraising help and the glossy memoir -- has fueled speculation Clinton is already running for president. She even has groups urging her to run -- like The Ready for Hillary Super Pac that raised $1.25 million in the second quarter of 2013 -- as well as organizations that are questioning her credentials and laying the groundwork to oppose a run. N.H. Democrats raise money off Hillary Clinton attacks . ""This keeps her out there. It keeps her prominent in the national debate, keeps her prominently talking about the issues that will matter in 2016,"" CNN Chief National Correspondent John King said. ""While publicly she tells her aides to say her inclination is not to run, she is preparing to run and she is doing everything she has to do to be ready to run."" King said that it appears Clinton is trying to walk the line between being seen as resting on her front-runner status and enjoying the fact that she has the name recognition and prestige to wait longer than most anyone else. Clinton, Christie hot, others not . The fact that Clinton is again making appearances has generated commentary over what kind of message she would want to articulate. ""At the moment, her only one (message) is that she is a woman,"" writes Richard Cohen in an opinion piece in Tuesday's Washington Post. ""Becoming the first female president is a worthy goal, but it kind of falls into the category of miles traveled and countries visited. It is an achievement, even a stunning one, but it is not a stirring trumpet call."" Cohen's piece has been roundly criticized -- largely because Clinton has yet to launch any campaign. But the fact that he wrote the column speaks to the larger point: whatever Clinton does in the near term will further fuel speculation about a candidacy. This is not lost on Republicans. By all indications, Clinton is the most feared potential Democratic presidential candidate. A number of groups, including the Stop Hillary PAC, have begun raising money to derail any effort to run before it could get started. Anti-Hillary groups to beef up forces . Other possible Democratic candidates -- namely Vice President Joe Biden -- have not received that kind of attention. Biden jokes about co-hosting with Hillary . ""She knows exactly what she is doing,"" King said. ""It is a signal to all of those people who are urging her to run -- 'Look, I can't give you that answer. You are going to wait a year or more for that, but I am going to be out there and I am going to be in the mix. Don't worry about it.'""

"(CNN) -- So, we can't really give you the full definition of one of the newest additions to the dictionary. Not that one is needed. Everyone knows what an ""f-bomb"" is. But if you need to look up what it means, you can now in the 2012 update of the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, which describes the word as a ""lighthearted and printable euphemism."" It was one of 15 new listings announced Tuesday. Among them are ""bucket list"" (popularized by the eponymous movie), ""gassed"" (a slang word meaning drained of energy), and Oprah Winfrey's signature phrase, ""aha moment"" (a moment of sudden realization, inspiration, insight, recognition, or comprehension). ""Some of the new words this year provide colorful images,"" said Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster editor-at-large. ""Terms like 'man cave,' 'underwater' (when used to describe mortgages), 'earworm' and 'bucket list' paint vivid pictures in your mind,"" he said. ""They show that English speakers can be very creative as they describe the world around them."" The freshly added vocabulary also reflects a defining event of our time -- the global financial crisis: . ""Systemic risk"" (the risk that the failure of one financial institution could cause other interconnected institutions to fail and harm the economy as a whole). And ""underwater""(having, relating to, or being a mortgage loan for which more is owed than the property securing the loan is worth). Then there are this year's technology additions: . ""Cloud computing"" (the practice of storing regularly used computer data on multiple servers that can be accessed through the Internet). And ""sexting"" (the sending of sexually explicit messages or images by cell phone). That one sounds racier than f-bomb. Remember Anthony Weiner, whose sexting scandal cost him his congressional seat?

"(CNN) -- Sarah Murnaghan, the 10-year-old girl whose quest for a lung transplant prompted a change in national policy, is up and walking. ""Sarah walked 10 feet with her walker for the first time, actually made it out of the room!!!!!"" her mother, Janet Murnaghan, posted Tuesday on Facebook. The girl was helped by a physical therapist. The family's hope is that Sarah will soon be able to walk on her own -- something Janet Murnaghan has said she sees as the last major obstacle to leaving a Philadelphia hospital. ""The physical (component) is what's holding us back, more than her lungs, more than anything else. Her lungs look fantastic on the X-rays right now,"" Sarah's mom told CNN last week. Sarah, who turns 11 on Wednesday, was born with cystic fibrosis. She was on the transplant list for children's lungs for 18 months. Sarah wasn't able to qualify for adult lungs because she was too young; the agency that oversees transplants, the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network, had a policy that children only 12 or older could be prioritized for adult organs. The family petitioned Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to change the rules so Sarah could qualify for adult lungs. They argued the rule was unfair, and several lawmakers asked Sebelius to act. The organ network approved a change to their policy to allow lung transplant programs to request additional priority for younger transplant candidates. The change is effective for a year, when it must be approved by the board of directors. Sarah underwent two lung transplants days apart. The original transplant on June 12 at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia reportedly went smoothly but that evening ""... an emergency code blue was announced. Sarah's vital signs had begun descending rapidly as her new lungs started to fail,"" her family said in a statement. The girl underwent surgery immediately and was transitioned to a bypass machine that took over the function of her heart and lungs, the statement continued. She remained on the bypass machine -- ""her doctors prepared us for the probability that Sarah would die, either before a second surgery could take place or on the operating table,"" her family said -- until June 15, when new lungs became available and a second transplant took place. Although the donated lungs were infected with pneumonia, ""Each day since (the second transplant), her lungs have improved on X-ray and have continued to work better and better,"" the statement said.

"(CNN) -- North Korea is raising the temperature on its neighbors, saying in its latest threat that it would not give any warning before any attack on South Korea. ""Our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now,"" Pyongyang said in a statement published Tuesday by its official news agency, KCNA. North Korea said it was responding to what it called insults from the ""puppet authorities"" in the South, claiming that there had been a rally against North Korea in Seoul -- a rally it called a ""monstrous criminal act."" The renewed menacing rhetoric came a day after North Koreans celebrated the birthday of their country's founder, Kim Il Sung, who launched the Korean War. Kim Min-seok, a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry, said the latest threat from the North was regrettable. Amid concern that Pyongyang could carry out a missile test, Kim Min-seok said South Korea continued to closely monitor the North's military movements. Also Tuesday, a U.S. Marine helicopter participating in annual joint military exercises in South Korea made a hard landing in a province that borders North Korea, the U.S. military said. The drills by South Korean and U.S. forces have upset North Korea, as they have done in previous years. Pyongyang has suggested that the routine exercises, which are scheduled to continue until the end of the month, are tantamount to a declaration of war. The 21 personnel on board the CH-53E Super Stallion helicopter, which was making routine flights as part of the exercises when it came down, were taken to a hospital at the United States' Yongsan Garrison in South Korea, the military said in a statement. Fifteen have been released from the hospital, and the other six are in stable condition, the statement said. The military said it would carry out an investigation ""to determine the facts and circumstances surrounding this incident."" The five crew members of the helicopter are from the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, stationed in Okinawa, Japan. Conditions for talks . A North Korean foreign ministry spokesman dismissed U.S. calls for talks as ""nothing but a crafty ploy"" to deflect blame for the rising tensions, in a statement published by KCNA Tuesday. The United States urging dialogue is like a robber ""calling for a negotiated solution while brandishing his gun,"" it said. On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had urged the regime in Pyongyang to ditch its nuclear program and put a lid on its fiery rhetoric if it wants to hold talks. ""The United States has made clear many times what the conditions are for our entering talks, and they haven't changed,"" Kerry said in an interview with CNN's Jill Dougherty in Tokyo. ""The conditions have to be met where the North has to move towards denuclearization, indicate a seriousness in doing so by reducing these threats, stop the testing and indicate it's actually prepared to negotiate,"" he said. Kerry was speaking at the end of a three-day trip that focused on securing fresh commitments from South Korea, China and Japan to try to persuade Pyongyang to return to the negotiating table and renounce nuclear weapons. His visit followed weeks of dramatic threats by Kim Jong Un's regime, including that of a nuclear strike on the United States and South Korea. The White House announced Monday that South Korean President Park Geun-hye will visit President Barack Obama in Washington on May 7. ""President Park's visit underscores the importance of the U.S.-ROK (Republic of Korea) alliance as a linchpin of peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and in the Asia Pacific region, and of the central role of alliances in the President's Asia-Pacific rebalancing effort,"" the White House said in a statement. There is uncertainty about how advanced the North's nuclear weapons program is, but Kerry reiterated Monday the U.S. government view that Pyongyang doesn't yet have the capacity to carry out a nuclear attack. Last month, North Korea scrapped the 1953 truce that effectively ended the Korean War and said it was nullifying the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. It also recently pledged to restart a reactor at its main nuclear complex that had been shut down under an agreement reached in October 2007 during talks with the United States, South Korea and four other countries. Kerry said Monday that the United States is concerned that North Korea's dogged pursuit of its nuclear weapons program could have consequences elsewhere in the world. ""It is the belief of President Obama, myself and the administration that what happens here also has an impact on perceptions in places like Iran, the Middle East and elsewhere where we're engaged in nonproliferation efforts,"" he said. Pyongyang insists that its nuclear weapons are a necessary deterrent because of the threat posed to it by the United States and its allies. 'No more artificial negotiations' Multilateral talks on North Korea's nuclear program have ended in failure in the past, and Kerry said the United States isn't interested in going over old ground. ""We're not going to go through another cycle of artificial negotiations that are geared to simply attract some kind of aid or lull in events while they continue to pursue their devices' designs,"" he said. A U.S. State Department official said Monday that there are no plans to move toward direct talks, ""because North Korea has shown no willingness to move in a positive direction."" On Sunday, Pyongyang rejected a different proposal for dialogue, one by South Korea last week regarding the North's suspension of activity at the manufacturing zone that the two countries jointly operate. A statement via KCNA called the South's offer a ""crafty trick"" and ""empty words without any content."" Kerry's trip finished on one of the biggest dates on the North Korean calendar: ""The Day of the Sun,"" when citizens celebrate the birthday of Kim Il Sung, remembered as the ""eternal president."" He died in 1994 and would have been 101 this year. Current leader Kim Jong Un paid tribute Monday to Kim Il Sung, his grandfather, as well as his late father, Kim Jong Il, by visiting the halls where both men lie in state. It was believed to be the young leader's first public appearance in two weeks. Kerry said in Beijing over the weekend that the United States and China are calling on North Korea to refrain from any provocative steps, including any missile launches. Pyongyang made good on its promise to launch a long-range rocket around the time of Kim Il Sung's birthday last year; the rocket broke apart after launch and fell into the sea. North Korea has made more threats since then. It launched a rocket in December that apparently put a satellite into orbit, and in response, the U.N. Security Council approved broadening sanctions against the country. Angered by those sanctions, Pyongyang announced in January that it was planning its third nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches as part of what it called a new phase of confrontation with the United States. It carried out an underground nuclear bomb test in February, resulting in even tougher sanctions. Those measures, along with the joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises in South Korea, prompted an intensification in the North's threats.

"(CNN) -- According to Hollywood, nothing says ""I'm an evil mastermind"" like a cut-glass British accent and a lip-curling sneer. Why? We're not sure. But as one of the movie world's favorite stereotypes, this month we celebrate the London Film Festival by picking our top 10 British villains. Laurence Olivier as Richard III: The archetypal bad Brit . The criteria? Both the actor and their character(s) must be British. So, sadly, no Cruella de Vil, no Snow White's stepmother and no Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator. Plus, scroll down for the worst on-screen British accents... Don't agree? Think we've missed a villain? Sound off and read others' thoughts in the Screening Room blog. 1. Laurence Olivier as Richard III Richard III (Laurence Olivier, 1955) Britain's greatest actor plays Shakespeare's misshapen Machiavellian who watches as his plots and schemes fall apart. Olivier brings humanity to history's favorite hunchback, lifting him beyond caricature to become the definitive wicked uncle. 2. Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin Star Wars (George Lucas, 1977) Cushing is synonymous with Hammer horror where, as Dr Frankenstein, his perfect vowels, gaunt profile and twisted genius made him the ultimate evil mastermind. But it was as Princess Leia's tormentor, Grand Moff Tarkin, in Star Wars that he'll be best-remembered -- and where he was toppled, as the best British villains are, by his own arrogance. 3. Christopher Lee as Dracula Dracula (Terence Fisher, 1958) Cushing's tall and imposing partner in crime, Christopher Lee was best known as Hammer Horrors' in-house Dracula. His chilling, sonorous tones were later brought to Hollywood, most notably as treacherous and overreaching power-seeker Saruman in ""Lord of the Rings."" 4. Ian McDiarmid as Emperor Palpatine Return of the Jedi (Richard Marguand, 1983) All the really evil ones in Star Wars speak like British toffs, but it was sadistic, cowled Emperor Palpatine, McDiarmid, with his darkly seductive voice, who stole the show. (Admittedly, the electric blue lightning helped.) A masterclass in ruling through fear and manipulation. 5= Alan Rickman as The Sheriff of Nottingham Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (Kevin Reynolds, 1991) ""Locksley! I'm going to cut your heart out with a spoon!"" The only redeeming feature in Kevin Reynolds' stocking-stuffed turkey, ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,"" Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham rages in the mire, surrounded, like all the best baddies, by imbeciles. Sorry Al, sometimes life's just not fair. 5= Basil Rathbone as The Sheriff of Nottingham The Adventures of Robin Hood (Michael Curtiz and William Keighley, 1938) Rathbone shone as the nemesis to Errol Flynn's swashbucklingly superior Robin Hood. His menacing Gisbourne is a snarling, degenerate, luxuriously garbed coward who's a dab hand with a sword: the epitome of an overprivileged upbringing? 7. Malcolm McDowell as Alex de Large  A Clockwork Orange (Stanley Kubrick, 1971) McDowell's unsettling turn as Alex in Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" shows that even psychopaths can be alluring. The mascara-loving head Droog is the concentrated essence of the British villain -- precociously intelligent, emotionally frozen, sadistic and perverse. 8. Carl Boehm as Mark Lewis Peeping Tom (Michael Powell, 1960) This voyeuristic fear-fest sees Boehm play softly-spoken photographer-cum-murderer Lewis in Michael Powell's claustrophobic thriller, ""Peeping Tom."" Shy, retiring and perverse, was this Freudian portrait hinting at what could lie beneath the famous British stiff upper lip? 9. Ian McKellen as Magneto X-Men (Bryan Singer, 2000) McKellen and fellow RSC alumnus, Patrick Stewart, lent gravitas to the entertaining yet ultimately silly X-Men franchise. Only an actor of McKellen's caliber could utter his lines convincingly while wearing a dorky-looking bowling-ball on his head. 10. Terry-Thomas as Raymond Delauney School for Scoundrels (Robert Hamer, 1960) Not a classic villain so much as a cad, Thomas was the template for the lily-livered upper class bounder. Generally found twirling his cigarette holder while charming the ladies -- at least, when not swindling, cheating or behaving like an absolute rotter... Don't agree? Think we've missed a villain? Sound off and read others' thoughts in the Screening Room blog. And the worst British accents... Dick Van Dyke as Bert Mary Poppins (Robert Stevenson, 1964) ""'Ello, Merri Pawpins!"" Dick Van Dyke's faux Cockney created a whole new accent, which he passed on to Bart Simpson et al. Thanks. No, really. Kevin Costner as Robin Hood Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (Kevin Reynolds, 1991) His vowels were as mangled as the plot. At least Christian Slater had the grace not to try. Sean Astin as Sam Gamgee Lord of the Rings Trilogy (Peter Jackson, 2001-2003) Astin's faux-bucolic bumpkin starts out cute but swiftly becomes irritating. Consistent, yes -- and also slappable. Mike Myers as Shrek Shrek (Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, 2001) Why is Shrek Scottish? We haven't a clue -- but Myers' strangled tones make even the most forgiving Glaswegian wince. Tony Curtis as Antoninus Spartacus (Stanley Kubrick, 1960) The good guys speak American, the bad guys speak plum British. Fine -- but Curtis's Bronx drawl is truly jarring. Don't agree?

"(CNN) -- Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, the man allegedly behind the inflammatory film ""Innocence of Muslims,"" has been granted supervised release from a federal prison, according to the U.S. Justice Department. Bureau of Prisons records show the 56-year-old Nakoula is at an undisclosed halfway house in Southern California. He technically remains in federal custody, but the tentative release means he can leave the facility for a few hours a day. Until recently, he had been held behind bars at a correctional institution in Anthony, Texas. Filmmaker denies violating probation . Nakoula is due to be formally freed next month, according to records. He had been incarcerated since September 2012 for a probation violation related to a 2010 bank fraud conviction. Nakoula came to the world's attention after his movie, a trailer of which had been posted to YouTube, was highlighted last September by Egyptian media. U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice said in television appearances that the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the Benghazi diplomatic compound was the result of a spontaneous demonstration over the film, which was produced in the United States. Her assertions later proved untrue. CNN's Stan Wilson contributed to this report.","Nakoula Basseley Nakoula in custody for probation violation .

"(CNN) -- New Olympic champion Andy Murray remained upbeat about his U.S. Open hopes despite suffering a surprise loss in the third round of the Cincinnati Masters on Thursday, going down 6-4 6-4 to 38th-ranked Frenchman Jeremy Chardy. London 2012 silver medal winner Roger Federer, however, easily beat young Australian Bernard Tomic 6-3 6-3 to advance to the quarterfinals, where he will play American Mardy Fish in a rematch of the 2010 title match. Murray, the defending champion, was playing only his third match since winning gold, having rushed to Toronto where he won his opener but pulled out before the next due to a knee worry. Cincinnati is the last major tournament before the final grand slam of the year, which begins in New York on August 27. ""Going into the big tournaments, sometimes I've won tournaments in the buildup and it hasn't helped me,"" Murray told reporters. ""I had break points in the first set. If I had maybe gone up there, maybe I would have started to play better. But when I went behind, he started serving better and he was going for his shots. ""This year at Wimbledon I lost in the first round at Queen's and made the final there for the first time. I have won Queen's before and not done well at Wimbledon."" Rivals fear for injured Nadal's future . Chardy, ranked 38 in the world had already surprised former American number one Andy Roddick in the first round and had failed to beat Murray in their four previous matches. ""Now I feel very good on court, and I play very relaxed. It's good when I feel like this on the court,"" said Chardy. Chardy will next face former U.S. Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro, the sixth seed who beat Serbian Viktor Troicki 7-6 2-6 6-1. U.S. Open champion Novak Djokovic progressed into the last eight after veteran Russian Nikolay Davydenko retired with a shoulder injury after losing the first set 6-0. ""His first serves didn't go over 90 miles per hour, so something obviously was wrong with his shoulder,"" said world No. 2 Djokovic, the beaten finalist in Cincinnati last year and also 2008 and 2009. The Serbian will next play Croatian 12th seed Marin Cilic as he seeks a 14th successive victory in hard-court tournaments following his successful Toronto title defense and March's Miami Masters success. Federer is seeking to match Rafael Nadal's record 21 Masters Series titles this week by winning the Cincinnati event for the fifth time. Fish has dropped out of the world's top 10 after health problems, and is the second-highest ranked American at No. 20 after John Isner. ""He's always been a difficult player to play against for all players on tour, because he has everything a player needs: he's got a great return; he's got a great serve; he can move forward, and now obviously he moves obviously much better than he has at the beginning of his career,"" Federer said. Fish claimed his first victory over veteran Czech Radek Stepanek with a comfortable 6-3 6-3 win. ""He's been a very tough opponent for me over the years. Not only has he beaten me, he's beaten me pretty soundly most of the time,"" admitted Fish. Fish underwent minor heart surgery earlier in the year, to correct problems with the electrical connections in his chest, and has been struggling to regain full fitness. ""I certainly felt good. I feel fresh and strong. This summer has gone well for me as far as getting my match fitness back. I have had a lot of great wins on that court here and played a lot of great matches."" The other quarterfinal will be between 21-year-old Canadian Milos Raonic, who beat fifth-seeded Czech Tomas Berdych, and Federer's Swiss compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka -- who defeated Japanese No. 14 Kei Nishikori.","World No. 4 Andy Murray slumps to a 6-4 6-4 defeat to Jeremy Chardy .

"(CNN) -- Passions run high at the coalface of an Ashes series and the heat clearly affects those at the pinnacle of Australian politics too. As his nation battles to win the third Test against England, and keep the five-match series alive, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has left the game's officials in no doubt as to his disgust. With the match only a few hours old, Aussie batsman Usman Khawaja was given out caught behind by umpire Tony Hill, a call he instantly reviewed. And though countless replays offered no evidence Khawaja had hit the ball, the video umpire upheld the on-field decision, condemning the 26-year-old to a long trudge back to the pavilion. Rudd, who ousted Julia Gillard in a leadership election to become Prime Minister for a second time in June, was so incensed he took to Twitter to voice his displeasure to over 1.3 million followers. Using modern technology to bemoan cricket's new-age technology he wrote: ""I've just sat down to watch the test. That was one of the worst cricket umpiring decisions I have ever seen."" At the close of play on the first day, captain Michael Clarke's unbeaten century leading his side to a commanding position at 303-3, Rudd's message had been retweeted 2,759 times. His viewpoint was supported by one of Australia's greatest ever cricketers, Shane Warne, who took 708 Test wickets with his leg spin bowling during a glittering career. In his role as a television commentator he labeled the decision ""ridiculous"" and was one of the thousands that retweeted Rudd's remarks. ""There was daylight between bat and ball, there was no hot spot and no noise,"" Warne said. ""The only noise was when the bat hit his pad. ""You can see the bat hitting the pad, the ball goes past, no noise. There was clear evidence there as well. That is a ridiculous decision."" Umpiring decisions have caused much controversy in the previous two Tests matches, both won by England, who is looking to retain the Ashes for the third straight series. Under the Decision Review System (DRS) both sides get two reviews per innings, meaning they can refer a decision to a video umpire if they think it is wrong. The numerous camera angles available, as well as sound and hotspot technology -- which can detect even the faintest touch of ball on bat -- are designed to eliminate bad calls. The game's governing body -- the International Cricket Council (ICC) -- was forced to defend the umpiring during the first Test at Trent Bridge in Nottingham after a clutch of poor decisions, from the on-field umpires and their video counterpart. Rudd is the latest in a long line of Aussie Prime Ministers who have indulged their love of cricket. John Howard, who served between 1996 and 2007, was a regular visitor to Test matches involving his country at home and abroad. He also launched a bid to become a vice-president of the ICC but was blocked by the organization's board. Gillard was pictured at various cricketing events, while former premiers Bob Hawke and Paul Keating also tried to tap into their country's love of the game.","Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd tweets criticism of umpiring decision in Ashes Test .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's ex-wife Debbie Rowe is set to testify in the AEG Live wrongful death trial Wednesday, lawyers for the concert promoter said Monday. Rowe is expected to be questioned about Jackson's drug use during the 1990s when she traveled with him, married him and bore his two oldest children. She will be called as the next witness in the Los Angeles courtroom after an economics expert concludes his testimony aboutÂ the financial support Jackson would have provided his mother and threeÂ childrenÂ had he not died four years ago. Jackson's youngest brother made an unsuccessful effort to reach the singer in his last weeks because of family concerns about his drug use, according to testimony Friday. Lawyers for the concert promoter accused of liability in Jackson's death want to show that the pop icon was a secretive drug addict who was even beyond his family's help. Jurors watched video of Randy Jackson's questioning by the AEG Live lawyers about failed interventions he led because of his concerns about Michael Jackson's use of painkillers in the last decade of his brother's life. Jackson died from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol that a doctor told police he was using to treat his insomnia as he rehearsed for a comeback tour four years ago. Jackson's mother and three children are suing the concert promoter, contending it negligently hired, retained or supervised the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter in his death. Randy Jackson testified that he and his father, Joe Jackson, were turned away from the gates of Jackson's rented Los Angeles mansion on Carolwood Drive, the home in which he died weeks later. They were concerned because of ""reports to me that he didn't look too good,"" he said. Who is Debbie Rowe? ""After I had heard this, I said, 'Come on, let's go. We're going over there,' "" he testified. Other witnesses, including Jackson's makeup artist and the show director, have testified that Jackson suffered physical deterioration in the last two months of his life. ""There was a drug issue,"" Randy Jackson said, explaining why they wanted to reach him. ""He wasn't eating. All of these things were happening at the same and, you know, a lot of pressure."" He said he wanted to persuade his brother to leave rehearsals and enter a drug rehab program in San Francisco. ""Of course my brother wouldn't let me through because he wouldn't want me to see him like that,"" he said. The security guard told him his brother was not at home, he said. Jackson lawyers do not dispute that Michael Jackson had a drug dependency problem at times, but they say he went long periods of time without taking painkillers. The entertainer publicly acknowledged his dependency when he cut short his Dangerous tour to enter a rehab program in 1993. The drug use was connected to two decades of pain stemming from scalp burns suffered while filming a Pepsi commercial and several onstage accidents on tour, they say. He also used prescription sedatives to help him sleep, especially during the pressure of touring, they argue. The pressure was on again as Jackson prepared for his ""This Is It"" concerts set to debut in London in July 2009, they say. Jackson was getting nightly infusions of propofol in a desperate effort to cure his insomnia, which a sleep expert testified disrupted his natural sleep cycles and caused his physical and mental decline. AEG Live executives created an ethical conflict of interest by hiring Dr. Conrad Murray as Jackson's full-time physician for $150,000 a month, the Jackson lawsuit contends. Murray could not refuse Jackson's demands for propofol infusions since he was deeply in debt and could not risk being fired from the lucrative job, they argue. Jury applauds witness in trial . AEG Live lawyers say it was Jackson who chose and controlled Murray, not the company, and they had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments he was giving the singer in the privacy of his bedroom. While Randy Jackson was questioned for several hours by AEG Live lawyers, only about an hour of the video was shown to jurors Friday. Most of it focused on his repeated attempts to interrupt his brother's use of painkillers. ""I wrote letters to my family about his problem and that we had to do something to help,"" Randy Jackson testified. The letters would tell his parents, brothers and sisters that 'he's an addict,' and at this point, addicts aren't so responsible for what they do. So this is where the family needs to step in and do something about it because their desire becomes physical."" Jackson testified that he ""staged several interventions,"" including in Taiwan, New York, Las Vegas and Los Angeles. ""Four or five"" of those attempted interventions were at Jackson's Neverland Ranch between 2004 and 2006 -- around the time of the child abuse trial in Santa Barbara County, California, he said. MJ's 'pajama day' in court . Randy Jackson said he was able to get his brother off of drugs at one point, but he resumed just before the child molestation trial began in a Santa Maria, California, courtroom in 2004. ""He was really scared."" He fired Jackson nanny Grace Rwaramba because he suspected she was supplying his drugs, he said. ""Whenever she's around, he's wasted."" He asked older sister Rebbie Jackson to stay close to their brother, he said, telling her, ""Make sure you watch everything he does, because I have to get him in this courtroom every day and see this thing through."" Randy Jackson gave new insight into what happened that infamous day of the trial when Michael Jackson showed up late for court wearing pajamas. At the time, the singer blamed a back injury suffered when he fell in the shower, which sent him to a hospital that morning. Ex-bodyguard testifies about singer's drug use . His brother testified, however, it was ""because he didn't want to go to court."" ""I went to the hospital and he said to me, he says, 'I don't know what you're thinking. I'm not walking into that courtroom, so don't even think about it, Randy,' "" he testified. ""And I said, 'OK.' I said, 'But you're going to court.' He goes, 'No, I'm not.' "" Randy Jackson blamed the nanny for supplying ""some kind of patch"" that had drugs. Jackson also described an incident in which his brother had a bad reaction to a sedative while at a Beverly Hills home in 2005. The nanny called him, saying, ""You need to get over here. Something's not right,"" he testified. A doctor who lived nearby paid a house call and treated him, he said. He said his brother would ""kind of hide from me"" because he didn't want him to know about his drug use, Jackson said. Monday is the start of the 16th week of testimony in the trial, which the judge told jurors could last until the end of September.","NEW: Debbie Rowe is expected to be questioned about Jackson's drug use during the 1990s .

"(CNN) -- A school bus wreck killed a young child on the bus and the bus driver Monday in Indianapolis, officials said. Ten other children were injured, including two critically, according to the Indianapolis Fire Department. The girl killed in the wreck was estimated to be 5 or 6 years old. The wreck happened just before 8 a.m. on Emerson Avenue in southeastern Indianapolis, the fire department said. An investigation into the cause of the accident is under way. Witnesses said they saw nothing unusual before the bus hit an abutment beneath a concrete overpass, according to fire department spokeswoman Rita Burris. Officials are waiting for a coroner's report to determine if the driver had a medical condition that could have contributed to the wreck. CNN's Deanna Proeller contributed to this report.","Ten other children are injured, two critically, fire department says .

"(CNN) -- Newly released text messages reportedly from the morning of September 11, 2001, show panicked family members trying to contact loved ones and officials frantically trying to grasp what was happening. More than half a million messages, released by whistleblower site Wikileaks, reveal the panic, horror and pain of what happened that morning in the words of those who experienced it. On September 11, 2001, 19 hijackers commandeered four commercial jetliners, loaded with fuel for cross-country flights. Two were flown into the World Trade Center's Twin Towers in New York, one crashed into the Pentagon, and another, headed for an unknown location, crashed in Pennsylvania when it was disrupted by passengers. A total of 2,976 people -- not including the hijackers -- were killed in the attacks. Some people witnessing the attacks reached out to loved ones out of fear there might have been more attacks coming and they might die. ""The only thoughts I have are of Nicholas, Ian and you,"" read one text message. ""I am terrified. I needed to tell you that I truly love you. always, diane."" ""I want to hold you now,"" one text message a minute later reads. ""I know you have a new relationship and do not care about me. But just in case anything happens know I love you hon. Missed Ya good bye."" The first indication of a problem comes at 8:50 a.m., five minutes aft.er the first plane hit the World Trade Center. ""An aloha call is starting. This is for a fire at 2wt ..."" Another text message references ""a bomb detonation"" in the World Trade Center and asks recipients of the message to report back assessments of their areas. A minute later, firsthand reports started flooding in. ""The world trade center has just blow up, we seen the explosion outside our windows. Teresa ..."" At 8:53 a.m. a message from the New York Police Department's operations division mobilizes officers toward the World Trade Center, telling them to meet at Church and Vessey streets. At 9:03 a.m. the second plane hit the World Trade Center. ""It's a deliberate attack ... a second plane just few into the second tower,"" a message said 52 seconds later. By 9:25 a.m. the personal messages have grown more frequent and more frantic. Companies begin sending out messages asking for head counts on all employees. People begin sharing reports of what they are seeing and hearing on TV,­ including early reports of people jumping from the World Trade Center. Family members panicked, struggling to get through jammed phone lines to find out if their loved ones were OK. 9:25:40 a.m. ""Please call my work as soon as you get in the office. Need to know you're safe."" 9:29:38 a.m. ""Wondering where you are. Are you okay. Give me a call back asap. I just need to know these things. Even if it's collect. Call me. Darryl"" 11:32:56 a.m. ""if i do not hear from you by high noon, i am going to pick laura up at school and tell her her father is dead."" ""goodbye my sweety.....im going to miss yo,"" another said. ""Honey wanted to tell you how much i love you,"" one sender wrote. ""I was a little worried. I Don't want to lose you now that I got you back. You mean everything to me. You have my whole heart and life. I love you so much."" Some texts brought relief. ""My dad survived! I got a call from stepmom's coworker saying my dad is alive, although that is all the info I have. I do not know if he is injured or unscathed."" ""Abroer's father is alive,"" one text proclaims. ""survived WTC collapse. I am trying to contact family members to find out more."" ""urgent. It's tim. I'm okay. Call me at home...i was outside the building when it exploded, but i'm fine."" Others have to wait and worry. Numerous messages simply read: ""Are you okay?"" ""Where are you?"" or ""CALL ME NOW!"" ""pete is ok. He can't find his brother who works in the world financial center next to the trade center....."" one message read. The messages also give insight to the federal government's scramble to evacuate buildings, bases and high-level officials. ""Jim: DEPLOY TO MT. WEATHER NOW! Tom"" reads one message, referring to Mount Weather, the underground bunker where high-level officials are taken in a national emergency and a command facility for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A message at 10:24 a.m. appears to show authorities working to secure the first family. ""TWINKLE AND TURQ ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AND SAFE,"" the message says. Twinkle and Turquoise were the code names used for then-president George W. Bush's twin daughters Jenna and Barbara. At 10:32 a.m. a Secret Service message said ""ANONYMOUS CALL TO JOC REPORTING ANGEL IS TARGET"" -- referring to a call to the Joint Operation's Center refering a threat made against Air Force One, which used a code name of Angel. A message from FEMA at 12:37 p.m. notes ""we have no mission statements yet."" A message from the Secret Service's New York field office sent conflicting messages about where agents should report. The messages also frantically pass along reports of more attacks. Some turned out to be rumors, others real. Rumors were rampant: . ""There is a hijacked plane circling dulles airport. Please call me!"" ""unconfirmed reports of plane crash at camp david now."" ""think one more plane may have been hijacked and headed toward the capitol building...not sure."" Wikileaks says it has verified some of the texts and says they all appear to be authentic. ""I fully understand that this is very emotional material, but this does not mean that this is not part of our historic record,"" said spokesman Daniel Schmitt. ""And from the publishing perspective of the Wikileaks perspective, that is what counts. We are helping to maintain an uncensorable part of this day's record in more detail than has ever been provided before."" Wikileaks will not say if the source was in government, law enforcement, industry or was a private citizen with the capability to intercept messages.","Wikileaks site releases text message, pager messages from morning of September 11 .

"(CNN) -- Doctors Without Borders is pulling out of Somalia after more than two decades because of frequent attacks on its staff, the aid group said Wednesday. The group, internationally known by its French name, Medecins Sans Frontieres, has worked in the nation since 1991. It said civilian leaders tolerate or ""condone the killing, assaulting and abducting "" of aid workers. ""The same actors with whom MSF must negotiate minimum guarantees to respect its medical humanitarian mission have in some cases played a role in the abuses against MSF staff, either through direct involvement or tacit approval, particularly but not exclusively in south-central Somalia,"" it said. In 2011, two MSF members were killed in Mogadishu, and their convicted killer was released early, the group said. Aid worker dies after attack in South Sudan . In addition, 14 other staff members have been killed and dozens of MSF's ambulances and medical facilities have been attacked, the group said. ""In choosing to kill, attack, and abduct humanitarian aid workers, these armed groups, and the civilian authorities who tolerate their actions, have sealed the fate of countless lives in Somalia,"" said Dr. Unni Karunakara, MSF's international president. ""... The situation in the country has created an untenable imbalance between the risks and compromises our staff must make, and our ability to provide assistance to the Somali people."" The aid agency had a staff of about 1,500 in the nation to provide various services, including health care, malnutrition treatment, surgery and relief supplies. Somalia has been plagued by a long-running struggle between government forces and Al-Shabaab, a militant Islamist group with connections to al Qaeda. It has waged a war to implement a stricter form of Islamic law in the country. Two years ago, Somali and African forces pushed the militants out of the capital, Mogadishu, raising hopes of a return to relative security after about 20 years of violence. But the militants have maintained control of large chunks of southern and central Somalia, where they stage attacks. Until last year, Somalia had not had an effective government since dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991.

"(CNN) -- Major League Baseball is to investigate a possible racially motivated incident involving Baltimore Orioles centerfield Adam Jones during their game at San Francisco Giants Sunday. Jones took to Twitter to claim that a fan threw a banana at him during the ninth inning at AT&T Park. Jones, who is an African-American, voiced his displeasure on his official account. ""I want to thank whatever slap---- threw that banana towards my direction in the last inning,"" he posted. ""Way to show (your) class (you) jack---"" MLB Senior Vice President of Public Relations Patrick Courtney told CNN Sports Monday: ""We are looking into this situation."" San Francisco also promised action, but in a statement released to CNN said they had to date been unable to identify the person responsible.

""We would like to extend our sincerest apologies to Adam and the entire Orioles organization for this unfortunate incident. ""The inappropriate actions of this individual in no way reflect the values of our organization and our fans."" The Orioles enjoyed a 10-2 victory over last season's World Series winners, rallying from an early two-run deficit to score 10 unanswered runs. Jones hit a three-run homer at the top of the ninth inning to help clinch the victory. He said the reaction of some on Twitter to his angry posting could mean him closing his account.

"(CNN) -- Third seed Maria Sharapova was stunned on her return to action at the Western and Southern Open, losing to American starlet Sloane Stephens. Four-time grand slam champion Sharapova had not played since crashing out in the second round at Wimbledon in June due to a hip injury. Former world No. 1 Sharapova looked on course to make a victorious comeback in Cincinnati when she took the first set 6-2 against her 17th-ranked opponent. But Stephens bounced back, recovering from 2-6 0-2 down to take the match 2-6 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 and register her second career victory over a top-three ranked player. ""It definitely started out a little rough for me, but I'm glad I was able to turn it around and start playing some good tennis in the second and third sets,"" 20-year-old Stephens told the WTA's official website. ""At the start of the second set I was just going to start going for my shots a little more and hoped they would just go in. I'm glad I started hitting and finding a rhythm. That kind of helped me out for the rest of the match. ""Obviously when you're playing someone who's No.3 in the world, you know they're No.3 for a reason and they're going to be tough. You've got to go out and play your hardest. But when you think about it, you're like, 'Okay, I'm playing Sharapova.' Like, you've got to get your mind right."" The match was Sharapova's first since hiring U.S. legend Jimmy Connors as her coach and, while quick to credit Stephens, she was disappointed she was unable to continue the form she showed in the match's opening set. ""I didn't continue what I was doing well for the first set and a half, and that hurt me,"" explained the 26-year-old. ""I stopped being patient. I started making a lot more errors, especially off the first ball. Just errors I shouldn't make. ""Obviously I haven't played in a long time, but I've got to be ready from the first match. So it's disappointing, but that's how it goes in this game."" Second seed Victoria Azarenka had no such problems, beating American Vania King 6-1 7-6 (8-6). Belarus' Azarenka missed last week's event in Toronto with a back injury, but showed she was in good shape by recovering from 0-3 in the second set to take the match in one hour and 41 minutes. Azarenka and Sharpova both entered the tournament at the second round stage. ""I think the beginning of the second set wasn't very good for me,"" Azarenka said after advancing into the third round. ""There were quite a few unforced errors and just really fast mistakes that didn't happen in the first set. It went kind of quickly, but I was glad that I could turn it around there and come back even stronger. ""Then there was competitiveness. She was already in the game and playing at a much higher level than before, and going for her shots. So I had to stay with her and just take my opportunities, and I did. ""There was a little bit of inconsistency today, but first matches can be tricky. I just want to think about what I need to improve for my next match. That's the most important thing for me going forward."" Wimbledon finalist Sabine Lisicki crashed out after losing her first-round match against former world No. 1 Jelena Jankovic. Meanwhile 17-time grand slam champion Roger Federer began his defense of the men's title with a battling 6-3 7-6 (9-7) win over Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber. The fifth seed, playing for the first time since losing to Kohlschreiber's compatriot Daniel Brands at a clay-court event in Gstaad, Switzerland, is bidding for a record sixth win at the Ohio event. ""I think it was a match where I had to sort of just fight to come through,"" the 32-year-old told the ATP Tour's official website. ""I was playing really well at times, and then sometimes it was maybe a bit up and down. ""But assessing the performance overall, I'm very happy. It's good to be back and playing pain free. My mind's good. I was in a good place while I was playing, so it felt nice to win at the end.""

"(CNN) -- Two people were dead and dozens of others were taken to hospitals after a charter bus bound for an Oklahoma casino overturned on a Dallas-area turnpike Thursday morning, officials said. At least 44 people were transported to hospitals after the crash on President George Bush Turnpike in Irving, Texas, Department of Public Safety Sgt. Lonny Haschel told CNN. At least three people were in critical condition, said Dr. Paul Pepe, Irving Fire Department's medical director. Because many of the passengers were elderly, medical personnel were monitoring those with even minor injuries closely, said Pepe, who also is chairman of emergency medicine at Dallas' Parkland Memorial Hospital. Dr. Alex Eastman, who treated some patients at Parkland, said they were ""in good spirits"" and ""doing relatively well under the circumstances."" Of the 15 people brought to that hospital, four were in critical condition and 11 had non-life-threatening injuries, he said. They ranged in age from 66 to 80, he said. Haschel said the bus went off the right side of the road, hit a barrier, swerved left across lanes of traffic and struck a concrete median in a grassy area. ""It rode up on top of that concrete barrier, and then rolled on its right hand side where it came to rest,"" Haschel said. It was the only vehicle involved in the crash, he said. Passenger Daniel Risik, 73, of Fort Worth told CNN affiliate KTVT that the bus crashed and then started to shake before turning over on its right side. ""People were on top of people, screaming, hollering, yelling for help,"" he said. The bus driver survived and was sent to a hospital, Pepe said. The bus, owned by a Dallas-area charter company, was taking the passengers to Choctaw Casino in Durant, Oklahoma, according to the Department of Public Safety. Video from KTVT showed a bus on its side, surrounded by numerous emergency personnel. Traffic on part of the toll road was halted as responders tended to the scene. The National Transportation Safety Board said it has sent a team of investigators to the scene of the wreck.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama wants to renew the U.S. commitment to finding al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, according to his national security advisers. Osama bin Laden remains on the run despite a $25 million reward for his capture. The Obama team believes the Bush administration has downplayed the importance of catching the FBI's most-wanted terrorist because it has not been able to find him. ""We will kill bin Laden. We will crush al Qaeda. That has to be our biggest national security priority,"" Obama said during the presidential debate on October 7. But tracking down bin Laden won't be easy. In May, al Qaeda released an audiotape featuring bin Laden. But U.S. intelligence officials say they haven't had a solid lead on the terrorist mastermind's whereabouts since late 2001, when he was nearly captured in a battle with U.S. forces near Tora Bora, Afghanistan. Robert Baer, a former CIA field officer, told CNN he's talked to ""a dozen CIA guys who've been on the hunt for him, and half of them told me they assumed he was dead, the other half said they assumed he was alive, but the key word here is assume. They don't know.""  Watch the hunt for bin Laden » . Intelligence officials believe bin Laden is hiding in the tribal areas of northwest Pakistan, a remote and primitive region with mountain peaks as tall as 14,000 feet (4,270 meters) that make the terrain difficult to navigate. ""If you think of this as sort of a combination of [the hunt for] Eric Rudolph, who was the Olympic bomber, and the movie 'Deliverance,' multiplied by a factor of 10, that's really what you're focusing on in trying to find bin Laden,"" said Robert Grenier, the former CIA station chief in Pakistan. The region is divided into tribes, some of them warring. Developing sources in the area has been extremely difficult.  See a timeline of bin Laden's terror messages » . ""What you literally need to have is an army of individual informants, hopefully focused on the areas that you think bin Laden is most likely to be hiding in,"" said Grenier, now a security consultant with Kroll. ""But again, you need to have a whole lot of them, because one individual who may have access to the families and the clans in a particular valley, if he goes to the valley next door and starts asking questions, he's probably gonna end up dead pretty quickly."" The U.S. government is offering a $25 million reward for information leading to bin Laden's capture, but officials who have worked in the region say the people living there would consider it dishonorable to take the money. The United States has had some success killing al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan using unmanned drones equipped with Hellfire missiles, but those attacks have killed innocent civilians as well, complicating the political situation between the two countries. Obama plans to send more troops into Afghanistan to push back the growing Taliban insurgency, but experts warn there could be severe consequences. ""The president is going to inherit the problem the Soviets had roughly 15 years ago during the Soviet jihad. You cannot tame the people in the North-West Frontier Province and on the border in Pakistan and Afghanistan,"" said Dalton Fury, the commander of special operations at Tora Bora. ""The only army that has been successful has been Genghis Khan and his Mongol horde. They cut off heads and killed everyone in the villages, and since we have self-imposed rules of warfare, we are not going to do what they did."" Cooperation from Pakistan's military has been touchy, and most experts agree finding bin Laden is not a priority for Pakistan's troops. Fury says the best route for the president-elect to take would be to change the dialogue about bin Laden. Intelligence officials do not believe he is playing an operational role and so has no reason to move around or communicate. ""I think it's important to understand that bin Laden had his chance at martyrdom. He was in the mountains of Tora Bora, he ran away. In my opinion, I think we ought to promote this,"" Fury said. He believes taunting the al Qaeda leader may force him to prove he's relevant and, in the process, lead the United States right to him. Despite the challenges, many experts agree it is important to capture bin Laden. ""I don't think the American people will accept him surviving and us leaving. We will be the laughingstock of the world,"" Fury said.","President-elect Barack Obama to renew efforts to hunt down Osama bin Laden .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Prodding Israel and the Palestinian Authority to restart talks aimed at a permanent resolution of their decades-old conflict, President  Obama dropped a demand for an Israeli settlement freeze, U.S., Israeli and Palestinian officials said. Benjamin Netanyahu, left, President Obama and Mahmoud Abbas. ""Simply put, it is past time to talk about starting negotiations. It is time to move forward,"" Obama told reporters before a meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""It is time to show the flexibility and common sense and sense of compromise that is necessary to achieve our goals,"" Obama said. Obama first met separately with Netanyahu  and Abbas on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in what he called ""frank and productive"" talks. The session was the first among the three leaders since Obama took office in January. George Mitchell, Obama's envoy for the Middle East, attended Tuesday's talks. He said the talks were ""at all times cordial,"" but ""direct"" and sometimes ""blunt."" Obama told Abbas and Netanyahu that, ""The only reason to hold public office is to get things done,"" and that everyone ""must take risks for peace,"" Mitchell said. Mitchell told reporters the U.S. is ""not identifying any issue as being a precondition or an impediment to negotiation."" But the United States and Israel have publicly disagreed on Israeli plans to build more housing on land the Palestinians regard as theirs. Previous Obama administration demands for a freeze have been ignored by the Netanyahu government.  Watch Netanyahu address peace, settlements » . Abbas has so far rejected resuming talks with Israel until the Jewish state halts all settlement building in the occupied West Bank and in predominantly Palestinian East Jerusalem. Arab states also have balked at the U.S. request to take confidence-building measures toward Israel until Israel freezes settlement construction. Sitting with Netanyahu and Abbas, Obama softened his regular language on a settlement ""freeze,"" saying that Israel has had meaningful discussions about ""restraining"" settlement activity. ""But they need to translate these discussions into real action on this and other issues,"" he said. ""Obama told Abbas that he couldn't get the settlement freeze and promised to keep trying, but that it shouldn't be a condition for talks and it was time to move on,"" one Palestinian aide to Abbas said. Several U.S. officials said that Obama told Abbas that although the U.S. believe a settlement freeze would create a better atmosphere for talks to begin, the lack of one should not be used an as excuse not to talk. ""Let's not have the perfect be the enemy of the good,"" Obama told Abbas, according to the officials.  Watch Obama: 'We have to find a way forward' » . ""It's been apparent for some time that the Israelis were going to fall short of what is necessary on the settlement freeze,"" one senior U.S. official said. ""But our view is let's get to negotiations and settlements will be addressed within those final status issues"" A senior Israeli diplomat said Israel agreed to not building any new settlements, no outward expansion of existing growth and to only build for ""natural"" growth within existing settlements. He said Israel also agreed not to encourage Israelis to move to settlements, which would increase the population. ""A complete settlement freeze wasn't physically or politically possible, especially in the absence of any Arab or Palestinian concessions,"" the Israeli diplomat said. ""There was a time the gaps had significantly narrowed, but now they were starting to widen. The administration recognized, rather than have them widen further, we should start negotiating."" The Palestinian aide to  Abbas said Obama's failure to secure a settlement freeze has weakened him in the eyes of the Palestinian delegation, because it casts doubt on his ability to move Israel during final status negotiations. The Palestinians did win an important point, however, with Obama making clear that the peace talks would not start from scratch, which Netanyahu had favored. Rather the talks would take into account progress made in previous negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, the sources said. The Israeli diplomat said that Israel would ""take into account"" the previous negotiations, but stressed his country's longstanding position that ""nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to."" Obama also addressed Abbas' desire to have the terms for negotiations more clearly defined, asking Israeli and Palestinian negotiators to come to Washington next week for further talks. Next week's talks, to be led by George Mitchell, will center on what issues will be addressed at negotiations, which will present the U.S. with its next big challenge. Palestinians want negotiations to resolve the ""final status"" issues of the conflict, such as borders, Jerusalem and the right of return for Palestinian refugees. Israel wants to begin with talks on a ""provisional"" Palestinian state.","NEW: Israel agrees to some limits on West Bank settlement growth .

"(CNN) -- The world's strongest storm of the year so far plowed across the northern Philippines on Monday, killing at least one person and leaving 20 fishermen missing. Packing winds as strong as 200 kilometers per hour (124 mph), Typhoon Utor made landfall early Monday on the east coast of the Philippine island of Luzon, damaging hundreds of houses. ""It's the strongest typhoon we've had so far on the planet this year,"" said CNN International meteorologist Samantha Mohr. ""So that gives you some idea of the magnitude of this system."" Utor, known in the Philippines as Labuyo, churned west-northwest over Luzon, dumping heavy rain on the island's hilly terrain and bringing the risk of landslides. It weakened as it moved over land, and by Monday afternoon, it had begun to head out into the South China Sea. Aid groups in the Philippines, which had been preparing for the storm's arrival for several days, said they were only just beginning to assess the situation on the ground in the hardest-hit areas. ""There's a high risk that part of the population may get isolated because of landslides and difficulty moving around,"" said Anna Lindenfors, country director for Save the Children in the Philippines. The country's National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council reported one death in the province of Benguet on Monday afternoon. Twenty fishermen who had headed out to sea before the storm's arrival remained unaccounted for, the agency said. But dozens of others who had initially been reported missing had returned home safely, it said. The agency reported damage to 673 houses in the province of Aurora, where the storm made landfall. The typhoon destroyed nearly 80% of the infrastructure in Casiguran, a town that lay in Utor's path across the province, CNN affiliate ABS-CBN reported. The storm tore apart rickety houses and ripped the roof off a local hospital, the local broadcaster said, showing images of flattened homes buried under fallen trees. Situated near an area of the Pacific Ocean where typhoons form, the Philippines regularly suffers severe storm damage. An average of 20 typhoons hit the Southeast Asian country every year, and two or three of those cause serious damage, according to Plan International, an aid and development organization. Utor is expected to pick up more strength over the warm waters of the South China Sea over the next day or so before making landfall on the southern coast of China on Wednesday. CNN's Anjali Tsui contributed to this report.","Typhoon Utor makes landfall with gusts of 200 kilometers per hour .

"(CNN) -- Alexander Alfaro was convicted Tuesday on 16 of 17 charges related to the 2007 execution-style killings of three college friends. Alfaro, 20, was convicted of murder, felony murder, robbery, conspiracy and weapons charges, according to acting Essex County Prosecutor Carolyn Murray. Alfaro was found not guilty of attempted murder of Natasha Aeriel, the sole survivor of the attack. He is the third person convicted in the killing of Terrance Aeriel, 18; Dashon Harvey, 20; and Lofemi Hightower, 20, by shooting them in the head after forcing them to kneel against a wall on the grounds of an elementary school in Newark, New Jersey. Alfaro's attorney was not immediately available for comment. Three other defendants -- Jose Carranza, 32; Gerardo Gomez, 18; and Shahid Baskerville, 19 -- have yet to go to trial. ""We hope that he will join both of his other co-defendants, who are now serving multiple life sentences in state prison,'' said prosecutor Robert Laurino at a news conference announcing the verdict. ""As I have sadly said on two prior occasions, I hope that this verdict will give some small degree of solace to the families of Lofemi Hightower, Dashon Harvey, Terrence Aeriel and Natasha Aeriel.'' ""Our work did not end today,"" said Romesh Sukhdeo, a prosecutor who tried the case. ""We will now move forward and prepare for the next trial, which will probably take place in the fall.'' Two other men involved in the attack have been sentenced to life in prison. Melvin Jovel was sentenced to a total of 245 years in November 2010. He received three life sentences for each murder and 20 years for attempted murder, Carter said. Rodolfo Godinez, the first defendant to be tried for the killings, was found guilty on all 17 counts. Carter said Godinez was involved in gang recruiting and characterized himself as the ringleader who used a handgun and a machete in the slayings. He was sentenced in May 2010 and is serving 216 years in prison. Alfaro was 16 at the time of the killing. He will be sentenced on May 19 and faces multiple life sentences, prosecutors said.","Alexander Alfaro convicted of murder, felony murder, robbery, other charges .

"(CNN) -- That didn't take long. Just two weeks since the Supreme Court struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, state legislatures are moving quickly on voter suppression measures. Already, six of the nine states that were previously covered by the requirement that changes in voting procedures be pre-cleared have started to bring up restrictive voter ID laws. If there is a glimmer of hope for voting rights advocates, however, it's that the court merely ruled that the formula was outdated, and that Congress ""may draft another formula based on current conditions."" I agree with the court that indeed, the previous formula included in the Voting Rights Act does not address today's attempts to restrict the right to vote. In fact, I think it underestimates them. Under the former formula used by the Voting Rights Act, nine entire states and certain counties and municipalities in six additional states were required to obtain federal preclearance before passing new voting laws. But according to the Brennan Center for Justice, already in 2013 more than 30 states, including my home state of Wisconsin, have introduced more than 80 bills that would restrict the right to vote. These bills would do everything from requiring photo identification at the polls, to limiting early voting opportunities, to creating burdensome registration requirements. Although these efforts are not as blatant as previous voter suppression techniques such as literacy tests and violent intimidation, they are still discriminatory. The victims of these voter suppression efforts are usually the same, no matter the state: minority and low-income voters, the elderly and students. In a country built on the foundation of civic participation, voting should be our most fundamental right, the right that ensures all other rights we possess. But the right to vote is, contrary to popular belief, not explicitly guaranteed by our Constitution. Although the right is inherent or implied throughout our founding document, and amendments prohibit discrimination based on race, gender, and age, we possess no affirmative right to vote. If we did, state lawmakers wouldn't continue to pass, and courts would not continue to uphold, these various restrictive voting laws. So Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota and I have proposed a solution that we believe accurately reflects the current voting rights landscape; a solution that applies to all 50 states and protects the voting rights of all who call this country home. This spring we introduced a ""Right to Vote"" amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would guarantee an affirmative right to vote for all Americans, no matter where they live. Our amendment is both simple and absolutely necessary: It ensures that every American citizen possesses the fundamental right to vote in any public election where he or she resides, and empowers Congress with the authority to protect this right. The consequences of this amendment would be profound for the rights of voters everywhere. Now, it is the voter who has to demonstrate that his or her right to vote has been impeded by the state. With the ratification of our amendment, the burden of proof would switch to the states, which would have to demonstrate that they possess a compelling interest to restrict a voter's rights. This would mean that all of the states who believe that we need voter ID laws to protect against a ""crisis"" of voter fraud would actually need to demonstrate that such a crisis existed. Predictably, when an investigation into voter fraud was launched in Wisconsin in conjunction with proposed voter ID legislation, barely a case was found when someone had voted in place of someone else. Other studies have found the same thing. Voter ID laws to counter voter fraud represent little more than a cure in search of a disease, and states must be stopped from implementing these discriminatory measures. While the recent dismantling of the Voting Rights Act is certainly disheartening, we have a chance to strengthen our fundamental right to vote. As President Lyndon B. Johnson declared in 1965 to a joint session of Congress to encourage passage of the landmark legislation, ""There is no duty which weighs more heavily on us than the duty we have to ensure that right."" And there is no way that we can better protect that right than through a right to vote amendment to our Constitution. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Pocan.","Mark Pocan: States are moving on voter suppression measures after Voting Rights Act ruling .
Pocan: A ""Right to Vote"" amendment would guarantee voting for all Americans .
Despite popular belief, he says, Constitution does not guarantee right to vote .

"(CNN) -- Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni says ""it is clear for us here in Israel"" that chemical weapons have been used in Syria, and an international response to the crisis should be ""on the table in the discussions between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Obama"" during the president's trip to Israel. When pressed during an interview in her Tel Aviv home, Livni wouldn't say whether there is evidence that the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has directed the use of any chemical weapons. But she said this development poses a direct threat to Israel, which shares a border with Syria. Livni told CNN that ""the appearance is that it's not going to be only in Syria, but that Hezbollah can reach all these chemical weapons and use them against Israel in the future."" Israelis have long been concerned that Hezbollah, Israel's foe in neighboring Lebanon, could gain possession of Syrian chemical weapons if the Assad regime is further destabilized. President Obama just landed in Israel for a two-day trip, and two national security issues dominate the agenda: the nuclear showdown with Iran and the growing crisis with Syria. On both fronts, Livni says, U.S. leadership can make the crucial difference. ""The United States has the tools in order to prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon and in order to stop all this situation in Syria,"" she said, and she insisted that this is the time to act. ""It is not a favor to the state of Israel. This is something that represents the interests of the United States as well,"" she said. Israeli minister says she hopes U.S. helps restart peace talks . In February, Israel attacked a convoy of anti-aircraft weapons in Syria. That assault did not involve chemical weapons, but clearly their use would increase the stakes for Israel. Livni says Israel is prepared to take action: ""Yes, but I am not going to speak about it publicly. Israel has the right of course to defend itself."" There are reports that chemical weapons were used in two locations Tuesday in Syria, killing at least 25 people. On Tuesday night, U.S. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers told CNN there was a ""high probability to believe that chemical weapons were used."" And in the same interview, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Diane Feinstein said ""the White House has to make a decision in this. I think the days are becoming more desperate.""","An international response should be ""on the table"" amid Obama visit, justice minister says .

For 15 years Dagvadorj dominated sumo wrestling and became the most successful grand master the sport had ever seen. He retired in 2010 after the controversial wrestler was involved in a brawl outside a Tokyo nightclub. It brought the champion more bad publicity in Japan, but in his native Mongolia he is a hero. Locals call him simply ""The champ"". Still only 30, he is now embarking on a second career as a businessman. ""My whole generation has experienced the opening of Mongolia,"" he says. ""So I feel it is a great honor to be alive in this new free country. I feel blessed."" He has slimmed down since his professional sumo days, but his appetite for success is as big as ever. ""It is difficult to say if I will become world famous billionaire,"" he says. ""Sumo and business are completely different, different worlds but it is my ambition to become a big businessman. We should all strive for success especially as Mongolia has such a bright future."" Around twenty years ago, Mongolia abandoned a Soviet-style system and embraced economic and political reform. Vast quantities of minerals are driving the country's economic growth and with that wealth comes the potential for businessmen like Dagvadorj to make their mark on modern Mongolia. Dagvadorj owns a circus in the capital Ulaanbaatar and is behind a project to build a huge residential and entertainment complex. To finance it all he has started his own investment bank.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Japan on Sunday for the last stop of his Asian tour, a trip that has largely focused on the provocations coming out of North Korea. Kerry met Sunday with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida to discuss regional tensions, climate change and cybersecurity. ""We cannot in any way allow North Korea to possess nuclear weapons,"" Kishida said. Also, ""we agreed North Korea must stop its provocative speech and and behavior."" North Korea threatened in early March to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the U.S. and South Korea and has made a series of other threats since then.. Kerry said the parties need to work privately at ""the highest levels of government"" in order to bring about a peaceful resolution to the situation. ""Hopefully North Korea will hear our words and recognize that for the future of its people and for the future of stability in the region ... there is a clear course of action they're invited to take, and they will find in us ready partners,"" he said. North Korea issued a scathing warning to Japan on Friday, saying Tokyo should ""stop recklessly working for staging a comeback on Korea, depending on its American master,"" state media reported. Japan's Transport Ministry has issued a notice requiring its airplanes to report to the U.S. military if they fly near the U.S. military's Kadena base in Okinawa prefecture, the Kyodo News Agency said. The notice, made at the request of the U.S. military in Japan, is believed to be part of precautions taken against possible North Korean missile launches. Opinion: Why I fled North Korea . As Kerry visited the Japanese capital, North Korea responded to South Korea's call last week for open talks. ""If they have true intent for dialogue, they should drop the attitude of confrontation to begin with, not getting inveigled in wordplay,"" North Korea's state-run news agency KCNA reported. ""The possibility of dialogue entirely depends on their attitude."" South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, speaking with Kerry on Friday, urged North Korea to open talks. ""We urge North Korea to cease its reckless behavior and to stop issuing threats,"" he said. Future talks on climate, cybersecurity . Kerry said Japan and the United States agreed to make climate change a high priority as countries around the world seek consensus on a new international agreement to take effect in 2020. ""The foreign minister and I agreed to raise the initiative above the level that it is today ... because of the urgency of this issue,"" Kerry said. ""We have agreed to engage in a new bilateral dialogue based on three pillars."" Those areas of concern and focus are agreeing to a climate change pact for the next decade, lowering carbon emissions to reduce their impact on the climate, and planning new growth so that it has minimal effect on the climate, Kerry said. iReporter: Foreigners in South Korea unconcerned with threats from the north . In late November nearly 200 delegations gathered in Qatar to advance discussions on a new treaty while moving to extend the Kyoto Protocol, which most countries ratified in 1997. But not every nation signed on to the pact's second commitment period, which ends in 2020. Kerry also said high-level talks on cybersecurity will take place May 9-10. Visit to Beijing . In his first trip to Asia as secretary of state, Kerry visited South Korean and Chinese leaders amid growing tension over North Korea. Washington wants Beijing to ""stop the money trail into North Korea"" and give Pyongyang a strong message that China wants the Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons, two U.S. administration officials said. On Saturday, Kerry and Chinese leaders said their two nations would work together to press North Korea to tone down its provocations. He met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Keqiang and State Councilor Yang Jiechi. Kerry told reporters in Beijing that the United States and China are calling on North Korea to refrain from any provocative steps -- including any missile launches. Yang said China's position is ""consistent and clear-cut."" ""China is firmly committed to upholding peace and stability and advancing the denuclearization process on the peninsula,"" Yang said. He also said Beijing will work with its international partners to help restart the stalled six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program and hold it accountable to its international agreements. China, U.S. to work together to calm down North Korea . Support for Seoul . Kerry landed in Beijing after leaving Seoul, South Korea, where he pledged unbending U.S. military support against any attack from the North. During his visit to Seoul on Friday, Kerry said the United States would talk to North Korea, but only if the country gets serious about negotiating the end of its nuclear weapons program. ""North Korea will not be accepted as a nuclear power,"" Kerry said in the South Korean capital. His trip to Seoul came a day after a Pentagon intelligence assessment surfaced suggesting North Korea may have developed the ability to fire a nuclear-tipped missile at its foes. The Defense Intelligence Agency assessment is the clearest acknowledgment yet by the United States about potential advances in North Korea's nuclear program. U.S. officials think North Korea could test-launch a mobile ballistic missile at any time in what would be seen by the international community as a highly provocative move. But a senior administration official said there's no indication that any such missiles are armed with nuclear material. Pentagon spokesman George Little said that ""it would be inaccurate to suggest that the North Korean regime has fully tested, developed or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear capabilities referenced"" in the DIA study. The DIA has been wrong in the past, producing an assessment in 2002 that formed the basis for arguments that Iraq had nuclear weapons -- a view later found to be incorrect. 5 things we still don't know about North Korea's nukes .

"Santiago de Compostela, Spain (CNN) -- The driver of the train that derailed in northwestern Spain was charged Sunday with 79 counts of homicide by professional recklessness and an undetermined number of counts of causing injury by professional recklessness. At least 79 people died as a result of last week's crash. A court granted the driver, Francisco Jose Garzon, conditional release. His train driver's license was suspended for six months. He must report to court weekly, and his passport was surrendered. Earlier Sunday, the driver, who was hospitalized for two days while under police guard, was transferred to court, officials said. He was in court for more than five hours. The data recorders from the train are still with police. Questions have focused on the speed at which the train was traveling as it entered a curve in the track near Santiago de Compostela on Wednesday evening. The crash on the outskirts of the city, which is popular with tourists and Christian pilgrims, shocked the Galician region and the rest of the nation. Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz told reporters Saturday there are ""rational indications"" that the accident was the fault of the driver. Pressed on what those are, he declined to provide details. 5 questions on high-speed rail . Identifying the bodies . The crumpled wreckage of the eight cars sent careering onto their sides when the train derailed has been removed from the tracks, but the grim task of identifying the dead continues. Maria Pardo Rios, a spokeswoman for the Galicia regional supreme court, told CNN late Friday that 75 victims had been identified. At least 63 of the dead are Spanish, she said. Also among the fatalities are two U.S. citizens -- Ana-Maria Cordoba of Arlington, Virginia, and Myrta Fariza of Houston -- and some Europeans and Latin Americans. Fariza and her husband were on their way to celebrate a Catholic festival. He was injured and later released from the hospital. ""Myrta was our loving wife, mother, sister, mother-in-law, aunt and friend, and words cannot express our sense of loss,"" her family said in a statement. ""To all who knew her, Myrta provided irreplaceable love, compassion, courage, friendship and support. We will miss her dearly."" As they are identified, most of the bodies are being returned to their families, the regional justice department said. DNA testing will be conducted on some remains to establish their identity, it said. Police forensic experts said at a news conference Saturday there are 37 body parts that must still be tested to see whether they belong to bodies that have already been identified, or to others not yet known. The death toll rose to at least 79 on Sunday morning when another person died, a representative for the regional health department said. About 70 people who were injured in the crash remained in the hospital Sunday, about 22 of them listed in serious condition, the official said. At least five U.S. citizens were injured, said State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf. Local newspaper La Voz de Galicia said that a funeral service for the victims will take place Monday evening in the cathedral in Santiago de Compostela. Spain train crash victim: 'It felt like a roller coaster' Going too fast? Spanish news agency Efe and the national daily El Pais cited sources within the investigation as saying that the driver had said the train was traveling about 190 kilometers per hour (about 120 mph). Elena Garcia, a spokeswoman for national railway Renfe, did not disclose Friday the speed the train was traveling on an express track, where cars can move as fast as 250 kph. But she said the speed limit for the bend of track where the crash occurred is 80 kph. Rafael Catala, secretary of state for transport and housing, told Spanish radio network Cadena SER that the ""tragedy appears to be linked to the train going too fast,"" but that the reasons it was going so fast are not yet known. The express passenger service was nearing the end of a six-hour trip from Madrid to the town of Ferrol in northwest Spain when the crash occurred, the state railway said. Security footage revealed how, as the train hurtled around a bend, its cars derailed and slammed on their sides into a concrete support structure for a bridge. Opinion: Why high-speed rail is safe, smart . Flames burst out of one train car as another car was snapped in half. Rescue crews and fellow passengers pulled bodies through broken windows and pried open doors as stunned survivors looked on. Maria Vigo, whose home is on the bank above the rail tracks, told CNN how she heard a crash, then the deafening squeal of metal on concrete. ""When I saw the rail car flip into the air, I imagined something just horrible had happened,"" she said. She and husband Suso tried to help the injured, taking bed sheets to wrap around the injured and ropes to haul the survivors off the tracks. Firefighter Miguel Angel Bello said the first four minutes after he arrived on the scene were a desperate race against time. He and fellow firefighters smashed windows and kicked in doors to pull out the passengers trapped inside as rail cars went up in flames. A young girl in the wreckage called out to him. ""She was under wreckage she said she wanted to get out and go home,"" he said. ""But she died."" Survivor: We looked like the walking dead . Stephen Ward of Bountiful, Utah, who is in Spain serving on a Mormon religious mission, was one of the lucky ones. Still patched up and wearing a neck brace, he told CNN's New Day show of his ordeal -- and his relief that he made it out alive and without permanent injury. Ward, 18, blacked out when his car slammed on to its side, regaining consciousness only as he was being helped out of the train. It took him a couple of minutes to grasp that what he was seeing outside was not a dream -- and that people were dead. ""They were helping out other people -- there were bodies, there was screaming, there was smoke."" The survivors looked like the walking dead, he said. ""I've got staples all over my scalp, I was covered in blood. They've scrubbed most of it off me now, but everyone was just covered in their own blood and occasionally the blood of others. It was gruesome to say the least."" Another victim, speaking from a hospital bed with his arm in a sling, told CNN affiliate Atlas that it seemed like the train was going fast. ""But we didn't know what was the maximum speed, so I thought it was normal,"" he said, ""And suddenly there was a curve, the suitcases fell, and everything went dark. And I hit my head a ton of times, and 10 seconds later I was wedged between seats, and I had people's legs on top of me."" The derailment came on the eve of a public holiday to celebrate a saint's day, when more people than usual may have been traveling in the region. Planned festivities in Santiago de Compostela and across Galicia were canceled after the crash. CNN's Karl Penhaul reported from Santiago de Compostela and Laura Perez Maestro from Galicia.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai ordered the arrest Monday of the Taliban who participated in the public execution of a woman accused of adultery. Shock and outrage have mounted since an amateur video surfaced of a burqa-clad woman sitting on the ground while a man standing a few feet away shoots her nine times before a cheering mob. The execution raises questions about what the 2014 withdrawal of NATO troops from Afghanistan will mean for women, who regained basic rights of education and voting after the fall of the Taliban in 2001. Karzai condemned the killing and ordered security officials to arrest and punish those involved, according to a statement released by the president's press office. Saving Face: The struggle and survival of Afghan women . Officials in Afghanistan, where the amateur video was taken, believe the woman was executed because two Taliban commanders had a dispute over her, according to the governor of the province where the killing took place. Both apparently had some kind of relationship with the woman, Parwan province Gov. Abdul Basir Salangi said. To save face, they accused her of adultery, Salangi told CNN on Sunday. Then they ""faked a court to decide about the fate of this woman and in one hour, they executed the woman,"" he added. Both Taliban commanders were subsequently killed by a third Taliban commander, Salangi said. Karzai called on officials to track down everyone involved, including those in the video. ""We went there to investigate, and we are still looking for people who were involved in this brutal act,"" he said Sunday. U.S. Marine Gen. John Allen, commander of NATO-led forces in Afghanistan, said he was encouraged by reports that provincial police were ""investigating the circumstances surrounding this atrocity."" He also offered the assistance of NATO troops to track down those responsible for the killing, according to a statement released by the U.S.-lead International Security Assistance Force. 6 American troops killed in Afghanistan IED attack . The killing took place in the village of Qimchok in Shinwari district, just north of the capital of Kabul. Karzai described those involved in the shooting death as ""cowards,"" saying ""such crimes are unforgivable both in Islam and under our country's laws,"" the statement from his press office said. The United States condemned the killing ""in the strongest possible terms,"" calling it a ""cold-blooded murder."" ""The protection of women's rights is critical around the world, but especially in Afghanistan, where such rights were ignored, attacked and eroded under Taliban rule,"" the American Embassy said in a statement Sunday. The public execution is the latest and among the most shocking examples of violence against women in Afghanistan, but it is far from an isolated case. Hundreds of students and teachers at girls' schools in the country have been hospitalized with suspected poisoning this year alone. Girls were forbidden to go to school when the Taliban ruled the country from 1996 to 2001. Nearly nine out of 10 women suffer physical, sexual or psychological violence or forced marriage at least once in their lifetimes, Human Rights Watch said in its 2012 annual report.

"(CNN) -- The One Fund Boston, a nonprofit created to benefit the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings, has begun distributing nearly $61 million to 232 eligible claimants, the fund said in a news release Saturday. Payments will be issued beginning June 30 and represent 100% of all the money that was collected by the fund through June 26, the release said . At least 264 people were wounded and 3 were killed in the double bombings, which took place near the Boston marathon finish line on April 15. To be considered for payment, those injured had to file claims. While it was not specified in the release, failure to do so could explain why about 30 of those injured are not included among the claimants. Payments will be made to claimants in each of the four classifications of claims (categories A through D), according to the release. Six people in Category A will each receive $2,195,000. This category includes loss of life and those who sustained double amputations of limbs or permanent brain damage. Fourteen people in Category B will each receive $1,195,000. This category includes those who sustained a single amputation of a limb. Sixty-nine people in Category C will each receive between $125,000 and $948,300. This category includes those who were physically injured and hospitalized for one or more nights and they will receive their payments determined by length of hospital stay. The final category, D, will give 143 people $8,000 each. This category includes those who were physically injured but released without an overnight hospital stay. ""No amount of money can replace what has been lost,"" One Fund Boston Administrator Kenneth Feinberg said, ""But (the tragedy) was made lighter by the unprecedented generosity of Bostonians, of Americans, and of people around the world."" The One Fund Boston was established by Boston Mayor Tom Menino and Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick. The release states that the One Fund will use donations received after June 26 to continue to support the survivors and victims' families who have been most affected by the tragedy. No deadline has been established for donations.","At least 264 people were wounded and 3 were killed in Boston Marathon bombings .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- For years, Connie and Daniel Roddy did all they could to support Livestrong, raising tens of thousands of dollars for the cancer charity founded by cyclist Lance Armstrong. ""It all started when Lance's first book came out,"" Connie Roddy said, referring to the 2001 publication of ""It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life,"" which details Armstrong's bout with testicular cancer. ""I read it cover to cover. I was just so taken by who he said he was."" The Roddys, who live in Santa Monica, California, say they initially gave $50,000 to the foundation. In 2003, Connie Roddy said, she helped organize an event for the foundation at a health club that raised an additional $150,000. Now they want their money back. ""I feel we were really fooled. We were really hoodwinked,"" she said. Their concern comes in the wake of last week's finding by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency of ""overwhelming"" evidence that Armstrong was involved as a professional cyclist in ""the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program."" Doping scandal costs Lance Armstrong sponsors, charity role . Armstrong stepped down as chairman of Livestrong this week and has lost endorsement deals with Nike and Anheuser-Busch. The seven-time Tour de France winner, who never failed a drug test, has consistently denied the allegations. Armstrong has not addressed the findings but has instead urged his supporters to continue fighting cancer. ""The mission absolutely must go on,"" he said Friday night at the organization's 15th anniversary celebration in Austin, Texas. ""We will not be deterred. We will move forward, and we will continue to serve the 28 million people around the world that need us the most."" The sport's governing body, the International Cycling Union, has said it will respond Monday to the doping dossier compiled by the USADA amid calls for Armstrong to be stripped of his seven Tour de France titles. The International Olympic Committee also is reviewing the evidence and could revoke Armstrong's bronze medal from the 2000 Sydney Games. But Dutch bank Rabobank was not awaiting any further review. It announced Friday that, after 17 years of sponsoring professional cycling teams, it will end its program at the end of the year. Dutch bank pulls out as pro cycling sponsor . ""It is with pain in our heart, but for the bank this is an inevitable decision,"" said Bert Bruggink of Rabobank's managing board. ""We are no longer convinced that the international professional world of cycling can make this a clean and fair sport. We are not confident that this will change for the better in the foreseeable future."" Rabobank said it had previously seen elite cycling as a good fit with the company, its clients and its employees. But that has changed since the USADA report alleging doping by Armstrong and others. Its decision drew a sharp response on Twitter from British cyclist David Millar, who rides for the Garmin-Sharp team: ""Dear Rabobank, you were part of the problem. How dare you walk away from your young clean guys who are part of the solution. Sickening."" The bank's decision was a blow to the Rabobank cycling team, according to its general manager, Harold Knebel. But other sponsors are sticking by the team, which will try to rebuild under a new name, he said. ""This industry can only survive with big international firms, and the way the sponsors now are responding to this situation is certainly not good,"" Knebel said. ""If we want to stay in cycling and grow cycling on the world scale, then something has to be done."" Livestrong bracelet: To wear or not to wear? But criticism poured in from some of the charity's donors. Former Livestrong donor Michael Birdsong of Salt Lake City is among them. ""The charity was established and publicized and got their funds based on a fraud,"" he said. Birdsong said he was attracted to the organization after his wife -- an avid cyclist -- was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1998, about the time Armstrong won his first Tour de France title. ""She found his story very inspiring,"" he said. ""Before we read his book, she would work all day, go to radiation treatments and go riding because that made her feel good."" In 2007, the couple ""became part of the public face of the foundation,"" said Birdsong, a software engineer. ""I was one of the people who would answer questions from people to raise money."" Though he had long been aware of Armstrong's alleged drug use, he said he didn't believe it. ""I was a huge Armstrong fan from 1999 to the time he retired; I would defend him from anyone."" Evidence of Armstrong doping 'overwhelming,' agency says . But, as his involvement with Livestrong grew, ""I started to ask what are they doing with all this money they are raising?"" The foundation's IRS filing last year reported more than $100 million in net assets or fund balances. The organization spent $2.1 million in compensation to its seven highest-paid officers and three employees, according to the IRS form. No member of the board, whose members include CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, was compensated, it said. Now, Birdsong said, he feels disillusioned. ""The whole thing is founded on a lie. The guy cheated, and he forced other people to cheat. I would like my money back. We donated under false pretenses."" Livestrong spokeswoman Katherine McLane responded Saturday by reassuring donors that the charity has always been dedicated to the highest standards of the nonprofit world. ""They chose to support not a single person, but a cause that benefits millions of people throughout the United States and throughout the world,"" McLane told CNN. ""They put their trust in Livestrong, one of America's top-rated cancer charities, and we can assure them that their trust was not misplaced."" McLane said 82% of funds raised by the Lance Armstrong Foundation, the charity's official name, are devoted to programs and services that benefit survivors and their families. Livestrong has actually seen an increase in donations and purchases from the its online store in recent weeks, McLane said. Purchases from the store, which sells Livestrong's trademark yellow wristbands, sports apparel and accessories, have doubled in the past three days, she said. ""It's something the foundation is incredibly grateful for, and we take that as a sign that people, even in troubled economic times, value the free services that Livestrong provides cancer survivors and their families."" Bob Kile of Kent, Washington, said he is unfazed by the Armstrong controversy. The 65-year-old throat cancer survivor he has no plans to remove the yellow bracelet that identifies him as a donor to the foundation. Highlights of the Armstrong report . ""If Lance doped, that certainly takes away from his athletic wins,"" Kile said. ""However, to survive what he did and come back at all is impressive. To come back and create good like he did with Livestrong is even better."" Actor Sean Penn expressed a similar view on Friday night, as he entered the Austin Convention Center for the anniversary event. ""Of course he remains an inspiration,"" Penn said in response to a reporter's question. ""I think anybody who's looking with a very clear eye at this would find themselves very hypocritical to consider otherwise."" The editor-in-chief of Bicycling magazine, Peter Flax, told HLNTV.com that he thinks the scandal would have an effect in the short term but that people should understand that cycling has already made moves to clean up its act. ""The next year or two will be difficult and pivotal years for the sport. People need to understand that the sport is way cleaner than it used to be -- far cleaner and more transparent than most other elite sports,"" he said. With Armstrong's disgrace, will anything change?

"New York (CNN) -- He's designed everything from upscale hotels and restaurants to the sets for Broadway plays and the Academy Awards ceremony. So you might think that creating a kids' playground wouldn't appeal to world-renowned architect David Rockwell. But it did. Rockwell, a father of two, became frustrated when he took his kids to traditional playgrounds. He found that these play areas lacked creativity. ""Traditional playgrounds are geared toward gross motor skills and linear play ... they are largely made of fixed equipment: seesaws, slides, monkey bars, swings,"" Rockwell said.  ""They are fantastic places to build gross motor skills."" So he decided to design a playground that focused on building imagination by letting the kids build the playground themselves. The first of his Imagination Playgrounds opened in July in lower Manhattan. ""[Imagination Playground] is a totally manipulatable playground in which every part of it allows kids to create their own constantly transformable play escape."" Visiting the playground in lower Manhattan is an adventure.  It's not every day, as a CNN reporter, I get to cross over a moat and dodge pipes and water noodles while getting doused with the occasional water splash. In a world of endless standardized tests and regimented schedules, Rockwell's playground is meant to encourage creative thinking, teamwork and risk taking. At first, it looks like a regular playground, but look closer, and there are no swings or monkey bars. Instead, there's water, real sand, big blue foam pieces in many different shapes, shovels, wheelbarrows, balls and lots of running space. Kids have to work together here: two boys are dragging foam pieces from the sand to the water, while another group stacks them. When I ask why they're doing all this work, they say, ""To close the hole in our bridge."" Most of the groups of kids have just met each other in the playground on this very day. Charlotte Kelman, 10, stopped and pointed to a shapeless stack of blue foam wedges. ""See, that's a boat you can float on,"" she said.  ""I was actually kind of helping make it."" She says she just met the kids who helped her build it in the park today. We spoke with Rockwell in the playground as two kids pushed past us with a wheelbarrow filled with foam blocks, while others built what Rockwell guessed was ""a raft city."" Laughing, he described it as ""a humbling experience for a control freak architect."" ""One hundred percent of the time, the kids do not use the objects in the way I designed them to be used,"" he said. Rockwell likes to visit the playground to see what new ideas kids have developed for his foam pieces. ""We're finding that kids are so over-programmed and have so little free time that when they get here, their own little creative potential is unleashed,"" he said. It took him more than five years to build Imagination Playground, and he didn't do it alone. He consulted with play experts and conducted focus groups watching kids use prototypes of the foam. Susan Solomon, one of the play experts who worked with Rockwell on Imagination Playground, would like to see more playgrounds like it. ""It's all about avoiding risk in most playgrounds, so it's been dumbed down and there's less and less kids can do,"" Solomon explained. This one is different because ""everything can be invented, reinvented, and this is critical for how kids learn. This enables kids to make their own decisions, to see cause and effect by building up, destroying, building again,"" she said. But building more playgrounds like this one won't be cheap: Rockwell donated his time and design expertise and helped raise money for the project. The Lower Manhattan Development Corp. donated $4.4 million, and the city of New York threw in an additional $3 million to get the underground pipes in working order. Solomon believes these kinds of play experiences help prepare kids for environments where not everything is controlled. ""Here, nothing is fixed, nothing is predetermined, and they can see consequences, learn to make decisions,"" Solomon said. ""They learn that not everything is already laid out for you in a way in which it's always going to be perfect: It's possible to fail."" Gail Daum brought her daughter to the park for the first time while we were there. ""I love it,"" she said as she watched her daughter help another little girl carry a large white pipe across the playground.  ""She just seems to be creating things and interacting with younger and older kids. It's been a great experience so far."" Rockwell is trying to raise a $5 million endowment to sustain the playground, which has some atypical costs, including replacing the foam pieces and paying for two ""play assistants"" who oversee the kids. Rockwell is also exporting the idea to other cities. He's made portable versions of the playground, which he calls ""Playground in a Box"" -- each contains the foam pieces and other loose parts. Rockwell says they're now in some parks and children's museums around the country. They cost between $7,600 and $11,700. He doesn't make money off this project. He says he does it because he believes it makes a difference, and he'd like to build more full-scale Imagination Playgrounds in other cities around the country. Rockwell smiled as we watched two girls try to dam up a waterspout. ""I love working for these constituents,"" he said.  ""They are my most interesting clients.""","David Rockwell designed Academy Awards sets, Nobu restaurants and W Hotels .

"(CNN) -- A house fire on the Fourth of July in Pennsylvania has claimed a 7th victim. A 2-year-old, Cordail Kuhns, was pronounced dead at 4 p.m. on Saturday, according to a spokesman for Crozer-Chester Medical Center in Chester, Pennsylvania. Spokesman Grant Gegwich was unable to release details on the cause of death. On Thursday morning, David Kuhns and his sons Shawn, 6, and Skylar, 8, died along with James Moore, who owned the three-story home where 14 people lived, said Capt. Fred Lenhart of the Lancaster City Fire Department. David Kuhns' wife, Crystal Kuhns, and their daughter, Mickey, died later while being treated at the burn unit at the medical center outside Philadelphia, according to Gegwich. Investigators are ruling the 3 a.m. fire as accidental and say it was caused by a pan of grease left on top of a stove with the burner on high, said fire Capt.Ken Barton. Four people who were trapped on the third floor of the home escaped through a window onto a rooftop and into a neighbor's house, officials said on Friday. One of those who did escape was the pregnant daughter of the deceased owner. Martha Moore, 27, nearly eight months pregnant, escaped and within four hours of the fire delivered a girl by emergency cesarean section. ""It's expected to be a bittersweet day. Her father dies and her baby is born,"" said Barton. Moore and David Kuhns died in the house while the two young boys died shortly after at the hospital. Two families lived in the home, located at 115 East Clay Street in Lancaster, Lenhart said. Investigators found three smoke detectors in the building but none was working, said Barton.

"Washington (CNN) -- House Republicans stripped food stamp provisions opposed by conservatives and narrowly passed scaled back legislation on Thursday to overhaul the nation's farm programs. Democrats chastised the GOP for ignoring initiatives they argue poor Americans need to keep from going hungry. The vote was 216-208 and no Democrat voted for it. Twelve Republicans opposed the bill. Debate on the floor was raucous and Democrats several times angrily screamed at Republicans and accused them of dismissing the needs of low income Americans. ""You have removed food stamps ... from this legislation. I don't know where it is going to go. It looks like it is going to die a slow death. It is despicable. What is it about poor people that you don't like?"" North Carolina Democratic Rep G.K. Butterfield said to House Republicans. Democrats decried the decision to discard a bipartisan framework and instead move forward with a vote only on sections of the bill focused on farm supports. Republicans pledged a vote at a later time on legislation focused on nutrition and the food stamp program, which is the largest domestic safety net against hunger. Food stamps cover more than 47 million people, nearly half children, according to the Agriculture Department. But escalating costs are a problem for conservatives as has been the program's continued expansion under the Bush and Obama administrations. The food stamp and nutrition program costs roughly $78 billion annually with participation rising sharply in recent years partly due to recession and the sluggish economic recovery marked by high unemployment. Food stamps account for much of the farm bill's overall cost. Many Republicans from rural states argued it was important now for Congress to address agricultural programs because farmers needed to plan. ""Farms and families in this country need the certainty of this agricultural policy and I ask that you support the bill,"" Georgia Republican Rep Austin Scott said. The legislation overhauls federal agricultural policy by consolidating a number of farm programs and ending direct payments to farmers while expanding crop insurance provisions. The Senate passed farm legislation last month that included the food stamp program and some lawmakers pointed out that House-Senate negotiations to craft a compromise could still include the initiative in a final package. But Democrats said there was no guarantee the House would ever vote on food stamps as part of farm legislation, and suggested GOP leaders lured support from conservatives for Thursday's vote by also promising to make deep cuts to nutrition programs in the future. The White House issued a veto threat on the new Republican version of the bill on Wednesday. For decades farm bills have been approved by Congress with fairly significant bipartisan support because they include both agricultural programs backed by those representing rural districts and nutrition assistance programs supported by those in urban areas. But a bipartisan alliance fell apart in the House, which defeated a previous version of the farm bill last month. Democrats then said proposed cuts were too severe and also protested additional work requirements for nutrition assistance programs. Republicans voted against the measure because they argued food stamp cuts weren't steep enough. GOP leaders scrambled to find a strategy that would get farm legislation through before rural state members go home next month and have to face disappointed farm communities. Splitting the measure in two pieces was the way to set aside conservatives concerns. Republican Agriculture Committee Chairman Frank Lucas said he couldn't guarantee that a nutrition-only package could pass the House, but he pledged to Democrats he would work with them to ensure those programs continued and were funded.","Farm bill approved by Republican-led House along party lines .

"(CNN) -- Mention the words Augusta, the Masters and clubs and you'd be forgiven for heading straight to the golf course. And if you're feeling good and looking for all things sugar and spice then here are a few facts which might help your Masters 2013 experience. Feel Good . The man himself, ""Godfather of Soul"" James Brown, still looms large in Augusta with his statue standing proud in the middle of Broad Street. Just a block away is the Imperial Theater where Brown would rehearse and fine tune his music before going abroad on world tours. Born in South Carolina, Brown is still revered with fans from all over the world traveling to honor the singer who died at the age of 73 in December 2006. Take a walk down a section of what used to be known as Ninth Street and you'll hit James Brown Boulevard -- a stretch of road where he used to shine shoes and earn a few dollars from passers by with a song and dance. And with the world's attention on Augusta, here's an all singing and all dancing guide to the biggest show in town -- the Masters. Forward thinking . Its critics might accuse Augusta of being stuck in the past, but the course has been one of the most technically progressive in the golfing world. This year, organizers have placed four sensors on each green which monitor the temperature, soil moisture and salinity -- all controlled by iPad. It's the latest in a long line of innovations from the tournament which was the first to introduce 72-hole golf over four days. Being first is nothing new to Augusta though. It was the first tournament to be covered live on radio, the first to introduce the over/under par system and the first to introduce bleachers. Tech savvy . While Augusta might have embraced technology, it's not so keen on spectators, or ""patrons"" as they are known, using all the latest gadgets. The course specifically bans cell phones, beepers or any kind of electronic communication system with cameras only permitted on practice days. If you do take a cheeky snap you end up losing your ticket and politely being asked to leave. Turkey shoot . Augusta's course is renowned as one of the most beautiful and picturesque on the planet -- but it wasn't always that way. During the Second World War, Augusta was forced to close and was used to house over 200 cattle and 1,400 Turkeys. So from 1943 until late 1944, the course resembled something of a farm and it wasn't until 1946 that August reopened, thanks in part to the help of 42 German prisoners of war from Camp Gordon. Keeping green . With each hole being named after a plant or shrub, its no surprise that Augusta takes the surrounding nature so seriously. Last year's cold snap meant that patrons missed out on seeing the beautiful Azaleas which have adorned the course for so many years. There's better news this year. Along with the Azaleas the dogwood, peach and cherry trees are blooming. The great old oak tree, which was planted in the 1850s, continues to charm, while the 61 large Magnolia trees which line the path from the entrance to the clubhouse were planted at around the same time. Eat like a champ . The Champions Dinner has been going since 1952 when Ben Hogan first came up with the idea -- but while tradition has remained the food revolution has shown no signs of stopping. On the Tuesday evening preceding the tournament, all the past Masters winners dine together with the reigning champion selecting the menu. In 1998, Tiger Woods and friends feasted on cheeseburgers, chicken sandwiches, French fries and milkshakes. Others such as Mike Weir went for Elk and wild boar in 2004, while Scot Sandy Lyle went for Haggis, mashed potatoes and turnips in 1989. Royalty . It's not just the players that get to eat like kings, the patrons are well fed too and the prices are phenomenally low. The world famous Pimiento Cheese sandwiches will set you back just $1.50 while the Egg salad, which has won rave reviews, is also available at the same price. You can pick up a beer for $3 while an imported lager will set you back $4. Antipodean angst . Don't mention Augusta to an Australian -- it has proved something of a graveyard for the nation's golfers -- and the country is still getting over the pain and torment of Greg Norman's capitulation, which came after squandering a six-shot lead to Nick Faldo in 1996. ""The Shark"" had already lost out in 1987 after losing to Larry Mize in a playoff. But Norman is not the only Australian to suffer at Augusta. Back in 1950, Jim Ferrier, who hailed from Sydney, had his three-shot lead wiped out in the final round as he slumped to second and ended his career without a Masters victory. Craig Parry, Stuart Appleby and Jack Newton all missed out on the final day, while Adam Scott and Jason Day were forced to settle for second in 2011. Spooked . Australia's golfers aren't the only ones to have been left Augusta spooked in Augusta. The town has a whole host of ghost stories, while the famous ""Haunted Pillar"" still stands proudly on Broad Street. The pillar, which used to support the market back in the 1830s, has been at the center of folklore since the story of how a traveling preacher cursed the town. The preacher was unhappy with the abuse he received and is supposed to have said: ""A great storm will tear this market asunder and only one pillar will be left standing!"" On February 8 1878, a tornado hit the city, killing several people, destroying the market and leaving just the pillar intact. It remains a tourist attraction, but only the brave actually touch it. First ladies . ""It's a Man's Man's World"" Brown once sang, but for how much longer? For the first time ever, you might see two women wearing the iconic Green Jackets at Augusta after the club opened its exclusive membership to women last August. For the first time in its history, women were invited to join with former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and South Carolina businesswoman Darla Moore both now members. Rice played a practice round with three-times Masters champion Phil Mickelson last Sunday before heading to the clubhouse which had been closed to women since it opened in 1932.","The Masters is held in Augusta, Georgia, every year .

"(CNN) -- The Olympics must use its global reach and immense popularity to help save a generation. That's the mantra from one of the men bidding to become to the next president of the International Olympic Committee -- Sergei Bubka. The legendary Ukrainian pole vaulter, who won Olympic gold and broke the world record 35 times, says sport must act now to pluck today's youth from the clutches of health problems. ""We need to save the generation,"" Bubka told CNN World Sport ahead of the start of the World Athletics Championships in Russia on Saturday. ""We need to bring them to sport. ""Today they have so many different interests. They have so many distractions, and we see a lot of health problems: obesity, diabetes. ""And we need to encourage them, not just to play sport in front of the TV, to use social media computers. We need to use this to engage them to sport, to make their lives better. ""When we look to the age of (our) sport audience it's around 50 years old; it means we need to work in this direction."" Bubka's passion is clear, as is his conviction that the outgoing president Jacques Rogge -- who relinquishes his role in September -- has done much to encourage youth participation in sport. The Youth Olympics, which features participants aged between 14 and 18, debuted in 2010 and is now an established part of the calendar. A key part of Bubka's manifesto is using modern methods to promote sport among the younger generation. ""We must go to the modern way, to use social media, to engage society, to engage the youth, to bring them with us to be active sportsmen,"" he said. ""This is a very important, key moment. This is a time not to lose a generation and President Rogge is leaving a fantastic legacy, and financially we are very healthy. ""It's now time to invest, to invest in the future, to integrate the movement to different parts of society. To change the life of the youths, and of course to continue to build a successful Olympic movement for the future."" To this end, Bubka acknowledges the huge costs involved in staging the biggest sporting spectacle on the planet provide a significant challenge for most modern hosts. London's eventual spend was an estimated Â£9 billion ($13.9 billion) with the next host, Rio de Janeiro, setting aside $2.45 billion for its organizing committee and a further $10 billion to be spent by the government on infrastructure, according to its official website. Bubka says it is vital to try and drive down costs so that the Games don't become an event that is out of reach for countries in poorer parts of the world. ""Of course the cost of the Games today and for tomorrow, for the future it will be prohibitive,"" he said. ""We need to look not to exaggerate, not to expand the Games when it's become really heavy. ""For that we try to control the size of the Games, we try to control the cost of the Games to make them cheaper, and more possibility for different parts of the world to get the opportunity to host the Games and promote the values in different parts of the world. ""It's a very important issue and it will be one of the priorities for the movement."" Another priority is to stamp out cheating in all its forms. Athletics has been tainted by a string of doping scandals in recent weeks. Former world champion Tyson Gay, from the United States, and Jamaica's Asafa Powell tested positive for banned substances in July, along with another Jamaican sprinter -- Sherone Simpson. This on the back of a failed test due to a banned diuretic from Jamaican Olympic champion Veronica Campbell-Brown, who will also likely miss the world championships in Moscow depending on the outcome of her case. Bubka is unequivocal in his stance. ""Regarding doping, of course it's a very sad, and very negative example,"" he said. ""And in some cases we can understand it. ""The system, which is developing, and also the role of the international federation, of WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) is getting stronger and stronger. I can see this positive trend. ""We eliminate the cheaters. We protect the honest athletes. We will not keep any excuse to anyone. This is a very important issue.""

"(CNN) -- As the winter sports season reaches its peak in Europe and North America so the toll of deaths and injuries will surely mount. Every year in the United States alone, an average of just over 40 people lose their lives on the slopes as a result of accidents in skiing and snowboarding, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. National Ski Areas Association. They are sobering figures and often trotted out when a high profile celebrity such as actress Natasha Richardson, the victim of a tragic accident in Canada in 2009, is involved. This was drawn into sharp focus again when Claude Nobs, the 76-year-old founder of the Montreux Jazz Festival, died Thursday in a Lausanne hospital following an accident on Christmas Eve. Even elite level athletes are not immune to the dangers and in the past year World Cup ski cross racer Nik Zoricic and fellow Canadian world championship winning freestyle skier Sarah Burke, have lost their lives. Regine Cavagnoud of France was the last leading alpine racer to be killed in 2001 and while there have been no deaths since then in alpine skiing World Cup or Olympic competition, there have been numerous sickening crashes. Calculated risk . Austria's Mathias Lanzinger lost control in a men's World Cup downhill at Kvitfjell in Norway in 2008 and had to have his left leg amputated below the knee. To an extent, that must be a calculated risk for the professionals because competitors in the Olympics or World Cup push themselves to the limit at incredible speed or attempting dangerous flips and turns. However, nearly every amateur skier will have a tale of someone whose alpine adventure has unfortunately ended up with a stay in the resort medical facility, flying back home with a leg in plaster with months of rehabilitation in prospect. Over Christmas, Ryder Cup golfer Miguel Angel Jimenez fell victim to a skiing accident, breaking his leg in the Spain's Sierra Nevada mountains and wrecking the early part of his 2013 season. But are winter sports really any more dangerous than other activities and what measures can be taken to cut down on the risks ?. Mike Langran, is a Scottish doctor who specializes in skiing safety and related issues and runs a dedicated website which gives advice and updates on the latest developments. He is also the President of the International Society for Skiing Safety (ISSS) and a Director of the Scottish Snow Sports Safety Study. Bad press . Langran is adamant that skiing gets a bad press when it comes to perceptions about safety and quotes international statistics, collated by the ISSS, to back up his claim. ""For snow sports, the average injury rate is 2-3 per 1000 participants on any one day. Compare that to an average game of soccer or rugby where perhaps the same number, or more are injured out of a much smaller number of players,"" he told CNN. The most typical winter sports accidents would involve knee sprains, head injuries and shoulder, wrist and lower leg injuries, according to figures on his website. ""With regard to fatalities, in the U.S. during the past 10 years, about 41.5 people have died skiing/snowboarding per year on average. During the 2010/11 season, 47 fatalities occurred out of the 60.5 million skier/snowboarder days reported for the season. ""The rate of fatality converts to 0.78 per million skier/snowboarder visits. Although it's not directly comparable, in the United States in 2009, 2,400 people drowned while swimming in public areas and 800 died while bicycle riding,"" Langran added. World governing body FIS (Federation Internationale de Ski) is only too aware of the potential dangers for leisure skiers and has produced its top 10 tips for safety on the slopes. FIS has recommended the use of helmets on the slopes since 2006, but their use remains voluntary, despite the type of accident which befell Richardson. However, some travel insurance companies now insist they are worn otherwise claims by injured skiers could be invalidated. Helmet use . ""I always recommend skiers and snowboarders to wear an appropriate helmet,"" said Langran. ""Although I don't believe the overall risk is high enough to mandate their use. Snowboarders, especially beginners, should also think carefully about using wrist guards to reduce the chances of a wrist injury. ""We know that on average snowboarding has an injury rate about twice that of alpine skiing -- mainly due to those wrist injuries amongst beginner snowboarders falling onto outstretched hands,"" he added. At the elite end, where speeds and the degree of daring are breathtaking, helmets are compulsory, but they cannot always prevent the tragedies which befell Zoricic and Burke. The FIS Congress in May 2012 promised urgent action to investigate the area of competitor safety, particularly in Ski Cross where four competitors start at the same time and battle it out over a course involving jumps and steep turns. Council member Michel Vion was appointed to chair a newly-appointed Ski Cross Working Group, which was composed of experts with a wide range of experience across the ski disciplines. He had an added remit to ""leverage cross discipline expertise in safety matters, notably with Alpine Skiing and Ski Cross in mind,"" read a report on the official FIS website. ""Safety is our utmost focus but ours is a sport in which some risk always remains,"" FIS spokesperson Riikka Rakic told CNN. Good advice . Improvements to equipment have led to reductions in injury rates, for instance the introduction of quick release mechanisms dramatically cut the number of lower leg fractures, while smarter ski design is helping the downward injury trend in the alpine disciplines, according to ISSS statistics. But with improved protection from equipment such as ski body armor, is there a danger of being lulled into a false sense of security and to attempt something above your ability level? ""My bottom line is -- If you wouldn't do the trick without the kit, think very carefully about attempting it with the kit,"" said Langran. It would appear to be good advice and he elaborates for the benefit of beginners taking to the piste for the first time. ""Take your time to gain experience on the slopes. Get professional instruction but don't be tempted to try too much too soon, especially if encouraged by more experienced friends. ""Read and follow the FIS rules. Use the best equipment you can, wear a helmet whenever possible and, if you're a snowboarder, get yourself a pair of good quality wrist guards,"" he emphasized again. With an estimated 200 million skiers and 70 million snowboarders in the world today, there are plenty of people who would do well to heed this advice and his overall message is that responsible participants have nothing more to fear on the slopes in comparison to other sporting activities.","FIS has top 10 rules for skiing safety on the slopes .

"(CNN) -- An intimate black-and-white photograph of Princess Diana as a teenager sold Friday for $18,396, a New Hampshire auction company said. The photograph -- which may never before have been seen by the public, RR Auction says -- offers a glimpse of the future wife of Prince Charles lying down, perhaps on a bed, wearing a light sweater or top. Only her head and arms can be seen. Behind her a young man leans against the wall, reading, his book resting on her shoulder. The future princess looks relaxed, half smiling at the camera. A bottle of whiskey can be seen on the windowsill. Another man is half seen in the foreground, but there is no clue as to who he or Diana's other companion might be. Large, black wording across the top of the photograph states ""Not to be published,"" and there are two dark lines under the words and above Diana's head. A lighter circle encompasses the words, Diana and the man reading the book. The only indication of date is a stamp on the back of the print saying 26 February 1981, two days after the engagement of Diana, then 19, and Prince Charles was announced by Buckingham Palace. They married in July of that year. The photograph likely was taken a year or two earlier. CNN's Joseph Netto and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","An intimate black-and-white photograph of Princess Diana had likely never been public before .

"(CNN) -- The dramatic overthrow of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsy has dominated the news agenda for much of this week. But away from Cairo's tanks and protesters, the world has generated other headlines -- some of which you may have missed. Here are five stories potentially drowned out by the noise of Egypt's unrest: . 1. In the U.S. state of Arizona, 19 members of an elite firefighting squad were killed while trying to dig a firebreak to contain a then 6,000-acre blaze on Sunday night local time. Nearly 600 firefighters and support workers battling the Yarnell Hill fire observed a moment of silence on Wednesday to honor those killed. Read more: Moment of silence only interruption in effort to end fire . By Thursday evening -- despite gusty winds and temperatures in the 90s -- the blaze was said to have been 80% contained. 2. Pakistan has continued to suffer from deadly attacks throughout the week. On Thursday, a suicide car bomber killed four soldiers in North Waziristan and four gunmen targeted a tanker carrying fuel for U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, killing the driver. The day before, a U.S. drone struck the compound of the Haqqani Network, killing 15 militants, Pakistani security officials said. Read more: Militants target checkpoint, fuel tanker . Pakistan's government -- which has called for Washington to end drone strikes in the country -- said it strongly condemned the attack. Meanwhile, in the city of Peshawar on the same day, officials said militants killed six members of the Frontier Constabulary, a paramilitary force. Read more: U.S. drone strike on Haqqani compound . The attacks followed car bombings on Sunday that killed at least 47 people. 3. In Indonesia, a 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck Aceh province on Tuesday, killing at least 30 and injuring almost 300 people. Most of the victims were children and the elderly, who were struck by falling debris, officials said. They said thousands of homes, schools and mosques were damaged and that the quake also triggered landslides, cutting off roads. Read more: Death toll in Indonesia quake rises to 30 . 4. What is believed to be the final text sent from yacht that went missing in June, with six Americans and one Briton on board, was found in the satellite phone system used by the boat this week. The schooner Nina was traveling between New Zealand and Australia when it was hit by a storm. The message sent on June 4, but never delivered, reads: ""THANKS STORM SAILS SHREDDED LAST NIGHT, NOW BARE POLES. GOINING 4KT 310DEG WILL UPDATE COURSE INFO @ 6PM."" The message gave search teams the approximate location and actual time of the last transmission, but the boat and its crew have still not been sighted. Read more: Last text from missing boat says sails shredded . 5. Finally, a hopeful story out of the Koreas. Pyongyang has agreed to Seoul's request to hold talks on reopening the Kaesong industrial complex. The complex sits on the North Korean side of the border but houses the operations of several of South Korean companies and is seen as a major symbol of cooperation between the two countries. It has been closed since April, when North Korea accused the South of seeking ""to turn the zone into a hotbed of war."" Tensions were already high following Pyongyang's long-range rocket launch in December and an underground nuclear test in February.

"(CNN) -- (CNN) -- The hostage standoff in St. Joseph, Louisiana, has ended with the hostage-taker and one hostage dead, police said. Louisiana State Police shot and killed Fuaed Abdo Ahmed as they stormed the Tensas State Bank, just before midnight local time, according to Col. Michael Edmonson. He said the gunman had threatened to kill the hostages. The two hostages -- a man and a woman -- were both shot by Ahmed as the police SWAT team entered the bank, Edmonson said. One of the hostages later died, and the condition of the second former hostage remains critical. Police said Ahmed was known to police, and Edmonson described him as a paranoid schizophrenic. Ahmed told hostage negotiators that he heard voices and wanted to have a device removed from his head. Edmonson said authorities believe Ahmed planned the events at the bank. They found a book on hostage negotiations at the bank after he was killed. Earlier in the evening, one bank employee was freed, while two of her colleagues remained held at gunpoint. Born in California, Ahmed moved with his family to northeastern Louisiana, where his family owns a convenience store, Edmonson said. The Mississippi River community of St. Joseph is about 35 miles south of Tallulah, Louisiana, and 35 miles north of Natchez, Mississippi. It is the seat of Tensas Parish, which has about 5,000 people. The incident began around 12:30 p.m., when the 20-year-old man entered the bank branch in St. Joseph with a handgun, taking the three bank employees hostage, according to officials. After word got out about the hostage situation, local, state and federal law enforcement agents descended on the quiet community. Law enforcement agents were able to talk to the hostages. They also spoke with the gunman. Edmonson said he talked to, and prayed with, relatives of the hostages. In 2012: Gunman wounded, ending French hostage incident .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- An unspecified number of Indian sailors have died after an explosion and fire on a navy submarine at a dockyard in Mumbai, authorities said Wednesday. Rescue efforts are under way at the scene following the blast and ""major fire"" early Wednesday on the INS Sindhurakshak, the defense ministry said in a statement. Defense Minister A.K. Antony later said that some officers had lost their lives, but he didn't give any details on how many had died. The Russian-built submarine has mostly sunk from the damage, the defense ministry said, and only a part of it is visible. About 18 people were on board the vessel at the time of the blast, it said. Images carried by CNN sister network IBN showed the night sky over the port area lighted up by the explosion and blaze, which began shortly after midnight. Navy and civilian firefighters were called into action at Mumbai's naval dockyard to tackle the flames and rescue survivors. By Wednesday afternoon, the navy had taken sole responsibility for the rescue effort, Mumbai fire chief Suhas Joshi said. An inquiry has been ordered to determine the cause of the explosion, the defense ministry said. In 2011: Probe, repairs ordered after Russian nuclear submarine fire . Refitted in Russia . The Sindhurakshak was commissioned in 1997, according to the Indian Navy.

The redesign included the installation of new missile, communication and cooling systems, as well as a new radar, the agency said. It reported that the upgrade also included other measures to improve the submarine's combat quality and operational safety.

"(CNN) -- Husband-and-wife stars of the popular reality TV show ""The Real Housewives of New Jersey"" pleaded not guilty Wednesday to a slew of federal fraud charges. Their trial has been scheduled for October 8. Attorneys for Teresa Giudice, 41, and Giuseppe ""Joe"" Giudice, 43, spoke Wednesday afternoon before the couple made their second court appearance. Attorney Miles Feinstein said the couple will not be testifying against each other in the case, which he said they expect to win. The couple is also planning to appear on the Bravo network's live after-show following the final episode of ""The Real Housewives of New Jersey,"" according to their lawyers. The Giudices were indicted on 39 counts, including conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, bank fraud, making false statements on loan applications, and bankruptcy fraud. HLNtv.com: Read the full indictment against the 'Real Housewives of New Jersey' stars . Authorities say the Giudices exaggerated their income while applying for loans before ""The Real Housewives of New Jersey"" debuted in 2009. The indictment says the couple then hid their fortunes while filing for bankruptcy. The indictment also charges Giuseppe Giudice with failure to file tax returns for tax years 2004 through 2008, during which time he allegedly earned nearly $1 million. During their court appearance on July 30, the Giudices were released on $500,000 bond each, along with several restrictions: They had to surrender their passports, and they weren't allowed to leave New York or New Jersey until their next hearing, which happened Wednesday. The judge is now allowing the couple to travel out of the area with a three-day notice. HLNtv.com: 'Housewives' stars free on bond . Teresa Giudice released a statement to HLN after being charged, saying she plans to stand by her man throughout the ordeal. ""Today is a most difficult day for our family.

I am committed to my family and intend to maintain our lives in the best way possible, which includes continuing my career. As a result, I am hopeful that we will resolve this matter with the Government as quickly as possible."" The prosecuting attorney has also said authorities may pursue immigration charges against Giuseppe Giudice, who is an Italian citizen. He could face deportation. If convicted, the couple faces up to 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine.

"Delhi, India (CNN) -- At least 12 schoolchildren were killed when their bus collided head-on with a truck in northern India Monday. The wreck, which left 10 others injured, occurred in Jalandhar district, Punjab state, police superintendent Yurinder Singh Hayer told CNN. The driver of the school bus was also killed in the crash, which happened at around 8 a.m. local time, according to police. Hayer said the bus had some two dozen schoolchildren on board. Police have launched an investigation into the incident. India has an appalling record when it comes to road traffic deaths. In 2011, more than 142,000 people were killed in about 490,000 road crashes, according to the country's transport and highways ministry. This equates to almost one accident per minute and one death every four minutes on India roads -- making it a bigger killer than HIV/AIDS and other diseases, according to the World Health Organization. During a recent road safety campaign, the ministry said many of these incidents were due to drink driving, a scourge it said needed to eliminated by spreading awareness and stringent enforcement measures. It added that state governments have been requested to remove liquor shops from the side of highways. Experts warn the Indian government has much to do in the fight to control the number of road deaths and encouraged it to draw on the experiences of others. ""Countries which have made progress have done so with political will at the highest levels of government and a sustained focus on what works,"" Dr. Etienne Krug, director of violence and injury prevention at the WHO, told the Times of India in December. ""Measures include identifying a lead agency for road safety; developing a comprehensive road safety strategy; and implementing concrete measures related to roads, vehicles and people's behavior. ""Responding to emergencies following a crash and ensuring justice for victims and their families are also key.""","Deadly wreck injures 10 in Punjab state .

"(CNN) -- Would you pay thousands of dollars to spend seven days running under the scorching sun of the Sahara Desert, traversing shifting sand dunes and punishing rocky plateaus for more than 220 kilometers, with all your food and kit affixed to your back? It may sound like insanity, but it's exactly what daring men and women of all ages have chosen to do by taking part in this year's iconic Marathon des Sables (MDS). Known as the world's toughest footrace, the MDS began Sunday morning as the driving sounds of AC/DC's ""Highway to Hell"" blasted through loud speakers to usher a record 1,024 competitors from nearly 50 countries into the heart of the Southern Moroccan desert. Over the next few days, the grueling adventure will challenge participants -- the oldest aged 76 -- to test their bodies and minds as they take on whipping sandstorms and blazing temperatures of up to 50C in their epic journey across the desert. To toughen the ordeal, competitors are required to carry all their equipment for the duration of the ultra-marathon -- from food and sleeping gear to an anti-venom pump and glow sticks. Three runners have died in the 28 years the race has been taking place. ""Some runners come here to push back their limits and brave the extreme to write their tale,"" says Frenchman Patrick Bauer, who founded the race in the mid-1980s. ""For a lot of participants, the Marathon des Sables is an opportunity to break with everyday life and feel a sense of timelessness. There is even a spiritual dimension, a quest for answers to what are at times very personal questions,"" he adds. ""The desert magnifies the soul."" 'Toughest race' The exact route for the week-long event, which costs more than $4,500 to enter, changes slightly every year but racers have to complete the equivalent of five and a half marathons over six stages -- including a non-stop stage of some 75 kilometers that must be completed in 34 hours. Read this: Sahara explorer taming the desert . Runners are provided with just their water supply and a tent to sleep in at night. They're also guaranteed spectacular views and stunning landscapes, as well as sore muscles, blisters on their feet and the inevitable moments of agonizing despair as they battle with weariness and dehydration whilst snaking their way past rolling dunes, steep-sided uplands, dried-up lakes and abandoned settlements in the baking heat. ""It's the toughest race I've ever done,"" says British ultra-running champion Jen Salter, who's competed at the MDS four times so far. ""That's a combination of having to carry, obviously, quite a lot of weight on your back, the temperature and the terrain -- some of the sand dunes, their stretches are really quite long. It's just unlike anything you can really prepare for or train for in another country,"" she adds. 'Crème de la crème' Yet despite such hostile conditions, the race's popularity is growing every year; due to high interest, competitors have to apply to enter MDS several years in advance. Currently in its 28th consecutive year, the roots of the MDS can be traced back to 1984, when Bauer decided to embark on a self-sufficient journey across the Algerian desert on foot, covering a distance of 350 kilometers over 12 days. That expedition had a major influence on the adventurous Frenchman, who realized that other people would be interested in taking on similar challenges. So in 1986 Bauer returned to Africa to organize the very first edition of the ultra marathon, completed that year by 23 pioneering runners. Twenty-eight years and more than 12,000 participants later, the MDS has grown to become a major endurance event whose model has been copied by several other races. ""It's the crème de la crème,"" says Salter. ""There are so many multi-stage races these days, but the MDS is definitely the one that sets a bar for others to try to live up to,"" she adds. ""The organization that goes into it is quite remarkable."" Indeed, putting the race together requires months of preparations and a plethora of resources: 120,000 liters of mineral water, 6.5 kilometers of Elastoplast, 400 support staff, 270 berber and Saharan tents, 100 all-terrain vehicles, 52 medical staff, 23 buses, 19,000 compresses and 6,000 painkillers. In addition, the organizers have two helicopters, one Cessna plane and six commercial planes at their disposal. '1,000 people, 1,000 stories' So, what is it that's attracting people from across the world to the vast unforgiving sands of the Sahara, turning the MDS into such a big event? Organizers say it is the tantalizing cocktail of testing one's limits and achieving the unattainable, helped by the haunting surroundings of the desert, which have shrouded the MDS with a veil of mystique over the years, making it appeal to all kinds of thrill seekers. Read this: An adventurer's journey to the top of the world . For experienced ultra-runners the challenge of self-sufficient running in the extreme heat of the Sahara is too good to ignore. Former competitors include British rowing legend James Cracknell, who completed the MDS in 2010. But the race's extraordinary concept is also a major draw for anyone with an audacious spirit. Over the years, a diverse caravan of novice runners, amateur athletes, enthusiastic 16-year-olds, spry septuagenarians and even visually impaired and partially paralyzed people have all converged on the MDS to test their limits, mark an occasion or escape briefly from their regular lives. ""Of the 1,000 people [in the race], you can be sure there are 1,000 stories,"" says Olivier Sepulchre, member of the MDS organizing team. He adds that more than just an endurance event, the race often becomes a breeding ground for lifelong friendships amongst runners. ""There is something magic inside the marathon because everybody is the same level,"" says Sepulchre. ""You can be a good runner, a bad runner ... you can be the most rich, or the most poor guy, [here] you are in the same level and that's something unique."" Salter agrees. ""The running is obviously amazing but a large part of it is also the camaraderie you have with your tent mates."" Salter even met her partner at the race. ""You share a tent with the same people for a week and it's really nice and you all help each other through.""","The 28th edition of the Marathon des Sables began Sunday .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Police were out in force at one of Jerusalem's holiest sites Monday, one day after 150 Palestinians rioted there. Masked Palestinians throw stones at Israeli border police in Jerusalem on Sunday. Authorities contained tensions at the site, which is known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram Al-Sharif. In one incident, though, police arrested 10 Palestinian youths Monday after some people threw rocks at Orthodox Jews, said Mickey Rosenfeld, spokesman for the Israeli police. About 30,000 Jews arrived at the Western Wall on Monday for the traditional priestly blessing on the holiday of Sukkot. The Western Wall is adjacent to the Temple Mount. About 150 Palestinians rioted near the site Sunday after police in Jerusalem closed the mount to Muslim worshippers and visitors. Police said they did so to minimize the possibility of violence after calls were issued in Palestinian media to ""come and protect the Mount."" Palestinians who had finished praying near the mount began to throw stones and bottles at police forces in the area Sunday, Rosenfeld said. Police dispersed the rioters and arrested three; one officer was slightly hurt, he said. Palestinian official Sabri Saidam accused Israel of ""stepping up its hostile confrontation to the Palestinian population"" by systematically seeking ""to alienate worshippers and the Palestinian inhabitants of East Jerusalem and beyond by allowing Jewish worshippers to visit al Aqsa mosque."" That mosque is part of Haram Al-Sharif, which means ""the noble sanctuary."" Saidam warned of more possible violence. ""Such attitudes may ignite the situation on the ground and are widely seen by Palestinians as an attempt on the Israeli government side to divert attention from the pressing need to end its occupation of Palestinian land and thus reduce international pressure on its different political domain,"" he said. An Israeli soldier was stabbed in the back by a Palestinian on Monday after boarding a bus at a roadblock near Jerusalem, Israeli military and police spokesman said. The soldier was hospitalized in ""moderate"" condition; police arrested the assailant, the spokesmen said. Sunday was the second day of Sukkot, a Jewish holiday when many Jews visit the Old City and the Western Wall, adding to the tensions in the area. Police re-opened the Temple Mount on Monday for Muslim males age 50 or older and to Muslim females of any age, but it remained closed to tourists.","Palestinians rioted Sunday after Israeli police barred Muslims from holy site .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Singer Chris Brown totaled his car while being ""ruthlessly pursued by paparazzi,"" his representative said. Brown was driving to a Symphonic Love Foundation event in Los Angeles when two vehicles cut him off. ""The occupants jumped out, with cameras, and aggressively approached his vehicle,"" Brown's representative said in a statement. ""In an effort to remove himself from the situation, he began to back down an alley, at which point his was cut off by two additional vehicles."" Beverly Hills police said Brown crashed his black Porsche into a wall Saturday afternoon. ""Brown stated that he was being chased by paparazzi, causing him to lose control of his vehicle,"" police said in a statement. The crash follows a spate of vehicular incidents involving celebrities and paparazzi. In January, a photographer was killed in traffic after taking pictures of Justin Bieber's Ferrari. Last year, a Los Angeles city councilman predicted such a tragedy after witnessing a high-speed chase of Bieber by paparazzi. Councilman Dennis Zine said the high-speed chase, which he estimated went for 15 miles, ended when a California Highway Patrol officer stopped Bieber and cited him for speeding. Zine has sponsored tougher punishment for photographers who break the law while stalking celebrities. ""I expected to see a crash,"" Zine said of the chase.

"(CNN) -- A viral video has real officers going for laughs with the serious intent of finding their next police chief. ""We wanted something that expressed our culture of openness,"" said Hillsboro, Oregon, Lt. Michael Rouches, the department's public information officer. ""It's not that we take our jobs lightly, it's that we tend to approach every situation with a positive attitude. So we thought, 'how could we demonstrate that message to a potential chief of police?'"" The answer came in the form of a scripted video that's part ""Law and Order,"" part ""Parks and Recreation."" It's been a smash on YouTube. Running a little more than six minutes, the video comprises sketch routines featuring officers on the 120-member force. ""This is our dispatcher, Earleen,"" an officer says cheerfully in one sequence. ""She's fantastic; you can reach her at 911."" All the officers, except one acting ""cool,"" are from the department. The two bad guys are professional actors. The video was shot over three days in early July and cost about $9,200. Rouches said the money came from the city's marketing budget. ""It's public money, and when we look at the return on this $9,000 we spent, the fact is that a lot of folks are paying attention,"" he said. ""I'm also very sensitive to the public's trust about the money, but the feedback from the people in our city has been very positive."" Hillsboro may be looking for an image makeover as well. The previous police chief resigned in March amid labor tensions, according to The Oregonian newspaper. In addition, a former commander filed a hostile work environment action against the interim police chief, who left in June, the newspaper said. Rouches said the environment has greatly improved. ""The issues internally have never been issues externally; they've never manifested themselves out in the field, and that's where the rubber meets the road for us,"" he said. Will the video be a hit or miss? Will it start a trend for first-responders looking for applicants? Lauri Stevens, a social media consultant for police departments, thought Hillsboro did the right thing. ""This video in my opinion was (and) is a risk,"" Stevens said. ""But I think in the long run, it's going to be a big win for both their reputation and their selection options for the next chief."" She also praised the department for being a trendsetter. ""Hillsboro is pushing that envelope and so they're going to be criticized. All pioneers have to take a few arrows in the back right?"" she said. ""They say they're not an uptight department and, I would say they're proving it!"" The video's director echoed the sentiment, calling it a ""fantastic"" way to get the word out. ""It was awesome that they wanted to do something like this,"" said Brett Eichenberger. ""We think outside of the box. I look at this as a great opportunity to get a positive message out there about the police."" Rouches said he has seen criticism of the video in web comments after articles about it, but he stands by the department's decision. ""If they could meet our folks, they could understand what we are trying to get across,"" he said. ""The whole thing is to connect with people and make good things happen."" And for anyone who may be interested, the salary for the Hillsboro police chief ranges between $101,916 and $137,880.

"(CNN) -- In his campaign to become Alabama's first African-American Democratic nominee for governor, U.S. Rep. Artur Davis downplayed race, bucked the black establishment and watched his opponent rack up endorsements from the state's key minority political groups. His strategy was unconventional, but in the days before the election, it appeared to be working. Davis held a steady lead over Agriculture Commissioner Ron Sparks in the weeks leading up to the primary, but when the votes came in Tuesday night, Sparks pulled out the win -- stomping Davis with more than 60 percent of the vote. Sparks will face the winner of the Republican contest, which will be decided in a July 13 runoff. Current Republican Gov. Bob Riley could not seek re-election because he is term-limited by law. ""This is not exactly the speech I planned to give,"" Davis said as he conceded and encouraged supporters to back Sparks. ""As I leave the stage, I hope that this district will continue to advance. Let's keep on believing in Alabama. Let's keep on believing in tomorrow,"" he said in a speech from his congressional district. Had the four-term congressman come out on top, he could have become Alabama's first black governor and only the third elected black governor in United States history. The historical implications of a Davis victory were not lost on the Deep South. A black man could have taken the oath of office near where Gov. George Wallace declared ""Segregation today, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever!"" in his 1963 inaugural address and where Jefferson Davis took the oath of office as president of the Confederate States of America in 1861. Davis, much to the chagrin of black political leaders, had no interest in focusing on the symbolism. ""He sees himself as a leader rather than a black leader,"" said Glen Browder, a former Alabama Democratic congressman and author of ""Stealth Reconstruction: An Untold Story of Racial Politics in Recent Southern History."" Davis opted against soliciting the endorsements of the major black political organizations in the state, all of which went to Sparks. ""The African-American voters who will participate in the primary need no permission, and no sample ballots, to decide who they favor in this governor's race,"" Davis said of his decision, The Birmingham News reported. The move highlighted the chasm between Davis, 42, and black establishment groups, headed by civil rights leaders like Democratic activist Joe Reed and former Birmingham Mayor Richard Arrington. They felt that Davis had shunned his own race, personally insulted them with his campaign and stood no chance against a Republican candidate in November, Browder said. Reed charged last month that Davis couldn't win the general election because he'd already told black voters he didn't want their vote. ""They still carry the scars of the civil rights movement, where blacks had to stick together,"" said Browder.  ""[Davis] does not have those scars, but he is the beneficiary of those wars. It's a generational fight that's going on throughout the South."" A primary win for Davis would have ""rewritten the textbook on Southern racial politics,"" he said, sending a message to Democratic candidates that they can win without those groups' backing. His loss shows that the old guard has not lost its grip on the black electorate, Browder said. ""This is the way that these black leaders have organized minority votes and effectively impacted Southern politics for decades. And it looks like they will continue to control and channel black influence in the political process for a while now,"" he added. But it wasn't just the clout of the black establishment that made some black voters question Davis. ""Artur Davis did do something to make black people not want to vote for him, and that is his 'no' vote for health care reform. Even before the black political groups stepped in the picture and refused to endorse him, he had already established a negative relationship with some of the black voters,"" said Angela Lewis, an associate professor of black political behavior at the University of Alabama-Birmingham. Davis, a friend of President Obama and an early supporter of his campaign, voted against the president's health care reform package in November. While none of Alabama's representatives voted in favor of the bill, Davis was the only member of the Congressional Black Caucus to vote against it. Some black voters accused Davis of putting African-Americans under the bus in order to get the white vote, Lewis said. The Rev. Jesse Jackson was equally upset, saying, ""You can't vote against health care and call yourself a black man,"" The Hill reported. Davis' office responded to The Hill with a statement that said, ""One of the reasons that I like and admire Rev. Jesse Jackson is that 21 years ago he inspired the idea that a black politician would not be judged simply as a black leader,"" referring to Jackson's 1988 presidential run. ""The best way to honor Rev. Jackson's legacy is to decline to engage in an argument with him that begins and ends with race,"" he said. Davis has tried to keep the focus off of race throughout his years in politics. During Davis' first successful campaign, incumbent Earl Hilliard tried to portray his challenger as not ""black enough"" for Alabama's 7th District, which includes urban areas in Birmingham and Tuscaloosa and rural, predominately black areas in the western part of the state.  The argument failed to resonate, and Davis won the election. In announcing his gubernatorial run in February 2009, Davis said he's always clung to one central belief: ""I think the poet was wrong when he said that the past shall guide our steps and that we shall judge the future by that which has already happened. ""I think that's wrong. I think that here in the state of Alabama, we don't have to have the past dictate our future,"" he said.","Ron Sparks comes out on top in Democratic primary for Alabama's gubernatorial race .

"(CNN) -- More than 12,000 California prison inmates are now taking part in a hunger strike launched to demand better conditions and a reduction in the use of solitary confinement, corrections officials and organizers said Thursday. The protest began Monday, when organizers said as many as 30,000 inmates refused food. By Thursday, a total of 12,421 prisoners had skipped nine consecutive meals -- the official definition of a hunger strike, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation -- and another 1,300 others have skipped work assignments or classes, prison officials reported. Organizers say the strike is a resumption two similar protests in 2011, one of which lasted for three weeks. ""I would say if the demands have been met, they wouldn't be going on a hunger strike,"" said Kamau Walton, a member of the Prisoner Hunger Strike Solidarity Coalition. ""People don't starve themselves for no reason."" U.S. to keep force-feeding hunger-striking Guantanamo prisoners . Inmate demands include an end to long-term solitary confinement and halting what's known as the ""debriefing"" policy, in which inmates are required to provide information on prison gangs to get out of solitary. Other demands include warmer clothing, better mattresses and better food. In a letter to Gov. Jerry Brown and Corrections Secretary Jeffrey Beard, protest leaders say the quality of prison food ""dramatically decreased"" since the California Prison Industry Authority began supplying the cafeterias. The strike's leaders are in the maximum-security prison at Pelican Bay, near the Oregon state line, Walton said, but inmates in other participating lockups are encouraged to add their own demands. The Corrections Department said the strike is organized by prison gangs and that inmates will face disciplinary action for taking part. ""Mass hunger strikes, work stoppages and other disruptions have the potential to impact programs, operations, staffing, safety and security,"" a statement from the agency read. The department said it had instituted reforms to its solitary confinement policies in 2012. Since then, more than 300 ""Security Housing Unit"" inmates have either been transferred back to the general population or are taking part in a program to gradually return them there, it said.

"(CNN) -- Ousted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya returned Monday to the capital city of Honduras, where he said he is planning to meet with his critics to arrange for his return to power. Zelaya was seized by the Honduran military in his pajamas and sent into exile on June 28. In the capital of Tegucigalpa, the interim government ordered a curfew from 4 p.m. Monday until 6 p.m. Tuesday, said journalist Erin Sandoval. ""I have never seen the sky so blue and beautiful,"" he told CNN en Español in a telephone call from the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa. It was Zelaya's first view of the city since June 28, when he was awakened by soldiers who then put him, still in his pajamas, on a plane out of the country. ""I have returned so that dialogue can carry on in my own land and in my own city,"" he said. ""I hope that in the next few hours we'll be able to communicate with the coup plotters."" ""For the moment, thanks to [Brazilian] President [Luiz Inacio] Lula, ... we have protection here."" Zelaya called on the armed forces to allow the matter to be resolved through dialogue. ""They're members of the pueblo,"" he said. ""We look for immediate dialogue. ... Our position is peaceful, it always has been."" He said thousands of people had taken to the streets of the city in support of his return. Zelaya said he spent Sunday night in Guatemala, and that his trip to Tegucigalpa took more than 15 hours. ""There was a lot of security and roadblocks,"" he said. ""There is a lot of persecution, a lot of fear in our country."" At the United Nations, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Costa Rican President Oscar Arias expressed hope that Zelaya's return could break the impasse with the Micheletti government and restore the ousted leader to office. ""Now that President Zelaya is back it would be opportune to restore him to his position under appropriate circumstances -- get on with the election that is currently scheduled for November, have a peaceful transition of presidential authority and get Honduras back to constitutional and democratic order,"" Clinton said. And Arias told reporters that Zeyala's return was ""the best opportunity"" to move forward with the San Jose Accord he negotiated. ""It's all we have on the table,"" he said. ""There is no B plan."" In a written statement, the secretary general of the Organization for American States, Jose Miguel Insulza, confirmed Zelaya's presence in the embassy and called on ""the actors involved in this process"" to be calm. He said the de facto government ""should make themselves responsible for the security of President Zelaya and of the Brazilian Embassy."" Zelaya's return comes as the United States has stepped up its call for the current Honduran government run by de facto leader Roberto Micheletti to restore Zelaya to power. Earlier this month, the United States revoked the visas of Micheletti, 14 supreme court judges and others. The United States also said it was terminating all non-humanitarian aid to Honduras in a bid to pressure the interim government to end the political turmoil and accept the terms of the San Jose Accord, which was brokered by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias. The accord calls for Zelaya's return to power. The political crisis stemmed from Zelaya's plan to hold a referendum that could have changed the constitution and allowed longer term limits. The country's congress had outlawed the vote and the supreme court had ruled it illegal. Micheletti and his supporters say that Zelaya's removal was a constitutional transfer of power and not a coup. The United Nations has condemned Zelaya's ouster and does not recognize Micheletti's government. While the United States has called Zelaya's ouster a coup, it has not formally designated it a ""military coup,"" which, under U.S. law, would have triggered a cutoff of all non-humanitarian aid. Senior State Department officials said the Obama administration was reluctant to make the formal designation in order to preserve its flexibility for a diplomatic solution. A presidential campaign in Honduras kicked off this month. However, the United States said it would not support the outcome of the elections unless Zelaya was restored to power.","NEW: Interim government imposes a curfew in the capital city .

"(CNN) -- The chief executive of golf's European Tour has dismissed reports the organization could be bought out by its American counterpart the PGA Tour. Reports claimed the U.S.-based PGA Tour wanted to take advantage of the current Eurozone financial crisis by launching a takeover of its European equivalent, which is based in England. ""The notion that the PGA Tour is somehow bidding to buy The European Tour is incorrect,"" the European Tour's chief operating officer Keith Waters said in a statement. ""The European Tour has collaborated with the PGA Tour and all other members of the International Federation of PGA Tours on many ventures since we worked together on the formation of the World Golf Championships in 1999,"" added Europe's chief executive George O'Grady. ""This collaboration will continue."" The European Tour hosts well-established tournaments all over the world, including in the lucrative Asian market. An acquisition of the European Tour would help the PGA Tour tap into potentially money-spinning countries such as China. But O'Grady poured cold water on the rumors, reaffirming the European Tour's commitment to hosting events across the globe. ""At this time when many of our leading members are also members of the PGA Tour it is vital that we continue to work together to ensure the progression of tournament golf throughout the world,"" continued O'Grady. ""Over the past two weeks, 35 European Tour members played in the WGC Bridgestone Invitational while 58 competed in the US PGA Championship. ""We are delighted that our Members continue to fly the flag for the European Tour around the world, which not only gives them the opportunity to progress their individual careers but ourselves the chance to explore opportunities to our mutual benefit."" PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem also denied the reports, but did say collaboration between the two bodies could increase revenue for the sport. ""Certain news reports today have indicated that the PGA Tour has made an offer to acquire the European Tour,"" he said in a statement. ""Those reports are inaccurate. ""However, as I have stated publicly on several occasions, the integration of professional golf can create additional value for our players, sponsors and fans. ""Such integration has been ongoing since 1994, with the founding of the International Federation of PGA Tours, and has led to the establishment of the World Golf Championships in 1999 as well as the World Cup as a federation-sanctioned event. ""More recently, all the major golf bodies around the world worked together to bring golf back to the Olympic Games."" The European Tour, founded in 1972, has recently seen top golfers like British duo Rory McIlroy and Lee Westwood head across the Atlantic to play on the more lucrative PGA Tour. The two tours jointly run the Ryder Cup, a biennial competition between the U.S. and Europe. Graeme McDowell, a member of three European Ryder Cup teams who plays on the PGA Tour, has spoken out against a takeover, saying it could damage the Ryder Cup. ""If PGA Tour bought (sic) European Tour things like Ryder Cup rivalry would be gone,"" the 2010 PGA Championship winner said via his official Twitter account. ""Yes our top players play mostly PGA but maintain Euro identity.""","European Tour denies possible takeover by PGA Tour .

"(CNN) -- A group of killer whales that had been trapped beneath ice and in danger of dying in Canada's Hudson Bay have not been seen Thursday, authorities said. Inukjuak Town Manager Johnny Williams said shifting wind patterns overnight allowed the ice to break as the 11 whales struggled to stay alive. The orcas had been confined to a space of about 30 feet by 30 feet. They were last seen Wednesday afternoon, according to Williams. ""The plane flew over where the whales ought to be, but they didn't find them,"" Williams told CNN, indicating the whales were no longer near the town. Williams said emergency crews redrew plans for deployment. ""We're in a stand-down mode, but we're still ready to go if needed,"" said Ray Lee, the president of Kasco Marine, which helped save whales in a celebrated rescue in 1988.

"(CNN) -- Marijuana and pain medication were found in the blood of the crane operator at the site of a deadly building collapse, a source at Philadelphia's City Hall with direct knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Friday. Six people died and another 13 were injured when a four-story wall of a vacant building being demolished collapsed onto a Salvation Army thrift store in Philadelphia on Wednesday. Mayor Michael Nutter publicly apologized earlier Friday ""to the victims and their families"" and ""to the survivors and their families"" for the collapse. The mayor pushed a new set of demolition standards and controls, promising he'll pursue whatever action is needed ""in order to better ensure our collective public safety."" He also promised answers. ""I commit to you that we will make every effort ... to find out what went wrong,"" Nutter said. Witnesses described an ominous rumble before the building came down, spurring panic on the streets. ""You felt it shake,"" Jordan McLaughlin told CNN affiliate KYW. ""There (were) people that actually fell over. People started screaming, they ran across the street. There was people inside the building, you heard them scream."" Searchers climbed over shards of wood, concrete and rebar looking for survivors, like the 61-year-old woman pulled alive from the rubble early Thursday. This search was called off late Thursday afternoon, by which time prosecutors and city officials had toured the scene.

"(CNN) -- In the early days of the Web, the mantra ""information wants to be free"" made the rounds. In music circles now, ""music wants to be shared"" seems to be the idea. The big record labels now allow fans to play their songs free on social networking sites. The big record labels, once more prone to awkward lawsuits against individual file swappers, now allow fans to play their songs free on social networking sites like Last.fm that use music as the social glue. And music sharing seems ever more entwined in everyday life, sometimes in subtle ways. Increasingly for instance it's easy to ""tweet"" to others what you're listening to. (A tweet is a post on Twitter, the micro-blogging site where you can broadcast to followers what you're doing, in 140 characters or less.) For instance Skype users can opt to display, next to their names, whatever song they're playing on iTunes. A new site called Blip.fm specializes in this, except it calls the tweets about what you're listening to ""blips."" Just as Twitter asks, ""What are you doing now?"" Blip.fm asks: ""What are you listening to now?"" Then it lets anyone else hear it. In effect, you get your own DJ space. Along with the song, you can add a comment about it. Many users now have hundreds of listeners on their Blip.fm page. A new service called TinySong.com makes it quick and easy to share music. Just type a song's name into its search box and it creates tiny URLs linking to various sites where that song can be played right now, for free. Creating a link and emailing it to friends takes seconds. Postcard.fm makes it an easy three-step process to create an email-able postcard combining pictures and songs from your computer. Music sharing is growing not just online, but in the physical space as well. Some bars and clubs now have ""customer DJ"" nights, where a customer can dock their iPods into the sound system and play tunes for everyone else. Copyright lawyers could clamp down on this sort of thing, says Mike McGuire, an analyst with research firm Gartner. Technically, at least. Businesses that play music to a crowd are supposed to pay a performance royalty to ASCAP, BMI or one of the other performance-rights organizations. But they're not likely to, says McGuire: ""Nobody will bother about that unless and until the clubs engaging in this become really popular."" A startup called Jook has an interesting approach to bringing music-sharing to the real world. Earphone manufacturers can incorporate Jook technology. With Jook-enabled earphones, you can broadcast what you're playing (Us mode), and then others sitting nearby can listen in (U mode). You'll know that they're listening to your songs by the green indicator light on their earphone cable's Jook circle, and they'll know that you're broadcasting by the red light on yours. Jook is platform-independent, so it works even if you have an iPod from Apple and your listener has a Zune  from Microsoft. ""Jook did something amazing by just saying, 'let's put this social media connection on the lanyard, make it cheap and make it multiplatform,'"" says Andrew Hawn, a strategist with consumer trends research firm Iconoculture. The way people discover music, he notes, has changed. It's no longer from a music nerd behind a counter, a la John Cusack in the movie ""High Fidelity."" Anyone now can be that music nerd -- and there are ever more ways to share the music.","Big record labels now allow fans to play their songs free on social networking sites .

"(CNN) -- Two young women arrested in Peru on suspicion of drug trafficking are in good condition and being well treated while in detention, a senior clergyman in Lima said Tuesday. The women, Melissa Reid, 19, from Scotland and Michaella McCollum, 20, from Ireland, were arrested by Peruvian national police at Jorge Chavez International Airport in the capital on August 6. They were stopped as they tried to board an Air Europa flight from Lima to Madrid after authorities allegedly found 11.59 kilograms (25.5 pounds) of cocaine in their luggage. Their final destination was Palma de Mallorca. The cocaine was found inside pouches of oatmeal and dehydrated foods. ""I was forced to take these bags in my luggage,"" said Reid, in video footage of the police interrogation. McCollum's family issued a statement Tuesday saying that they stand behind their daughter and are making arrangements to go to Peru. ""Michaella's family are obviously shocked and distressed by the recent events but are confident that Michaella will be exonerated,"" family attorney Peter Madden said. According to police, the pair were contacted by a Colombian named ""Enrique"" in Palma de Mallorca through a tourism company that flew them to Lima and then to Machu Picchu. But the tourism was cover for a plan to smuggle the drugs, police told CNN. Archbishop of Lima Sean Walsh, an Irish-American bishop who's been in Peru for the past seven years, told CNN he was able to meet briefly with the young women in the police cell where they are being held. He said the two are in good condition, are eating well, have clean clothing and are receiving good care. Walsh dismissed media reports suggesting they are not being treated well and that one of the women is on a hunger strike. Reid and McCollum are expected to appear before a judge Wednesday, he said. The Ministry of Justice normally has an official translator present, said Walsh, who often visits foreigners held in jail in Lima. While he was visiting the women, a prosecutor entered and told them that they needed to cooperate as fully as possible, Walsh said. He expects to see the pair again Wednesday evening, he added. They do not yet have an attorney to represent them that he knows of, Walsh said. The court system in Peru usually provides a public defender but they may try to hire private defense lawyers, he added. Walsh said he had also been in touch with the parents of both young women, who are feeling fear and shame over their arrest. He said McCollum's parents told him she had been calling them every day from Ibiza, the Spanish island on which, according to UK media reports, the two girls had been spending the summer. But the calls home stopped, he said, and the parents then started a social media campaign to find her. A UK Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We can confirm the arrest of a British national in Peru on 7 August. We are providing consular assistance."" A spokeswoman for Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said it was providing consular assistance to Connolly and her family through the Irish Embassy in Mexico, and was also working with the British Embassy in Lima. Peru is now the world's top cultivator of coca -- the plant whose leaves are used to produce cocaine -- having overtaken Colombia for the dubious honor.","Peruvian police are holding two young women suspected of drug trafficking .

"(CNN) -- Relationship breakdowns can happen to anyone -- even to cities. After nearly 20 years of building ties with their ""sister city"" of St. Petersburg, Russia, leaders in Lansing, Michigan, have found a key sticking point -- Russia's clampdown on discussion of gay issues. The city council in Michigan's capital voiced its concerns over Russian anti-gay policies on Monday by adopting a resolution calling for an end to the ""sister cities"" relationship with St. Petersburg. Local news site MLive.com reported that the vote was unanimous. Russia has been drawing controversy for a recently enacted law that bars the public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere that children could overhear. City council member Jody Washington first brought the matter before the city council during a meeting last month. Lansing Mayor Virg Bernero had issued a statement saying that while he opposes the ""oppression of the LGBT community in Russia,"" he also hopes to maintain the relationship with St. Petersburg, which began in 1994 with a Russian-language high school exchange program. ""I encourage the city council and the commission to issue a resolution condemning the violence and discrimination in Russia,"" Bernero said. ""We must denounce the bigotry, but we should not sever the sister city relationship, because we have the potential for progressive dialogue between citizens."" Meanwhile, a local agency said Tuesday there's really no relationship to sever, according to MLive.com. Lansing Regional Sisters Commission President Barbara Roberts Mason said it was only one district within St. Petersburg that was the sister city for Lansing, and that ""ceased abruptly"" when the governmental structure of St. Petersburg changed years ago. But the issue that triggered Monday's council vote is just one reflection from an international spotlight that is being cast on Russia ahead of the Winter Olympics in Sochi early next year. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the anti-gay law, which took effect last month. It has been condemned by Russian and international rights groups as highly discriminatory. Gay rights group All Out delivered a 320,000-signature petition to the International Olympic Committee headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, earlier this month. The petition urges the IOC to condemn the law and urges Russia to ensure the security of all visitors, athletes and Russian people before, during, and after the Games. The IOC said that it had ""received assurances from the highest level of government in Russia that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the Games.""","Lansing's city council votes to end ""sister cities"" relationship with St. Petersburg, Russia .

"(CNN) -- On June 30, in the streets of Alexandria, I watched crowds stream down Abu Qir street, one of the city's main roads, chanting: ""The Police! The People! Are One Hand!"" Officers posed for photos, waved Egyptian flags from pickup trucks jammed with anti-Morsy protesters and roared up Alexandria's wide boulevards on their motorcycles to cheers and waves. Some in the crowd refused to join in, but this was, just the same, a sight I never imagined I would see, after over two years of sit-ins in which the police had been the protesters' clear enemy. From the beginnins of Egypt's uprising, in January 2011, the overhaul of Egypt's police forces, known for torturing detainees and brutally dispersing peaceful demonstrations, was a key demand of protesters. But not even the most rudimentary reforms have taken place since then. Neither the Supreme Council of Armed Forces, which governed Egypt during the transitional period, nor Mohamed Morsy during his year as president made any attempt whatsoever to take on police brutality and torture. The army itself was responsible for similar abuses during the transitional period. Police officers have yet to be held accountable for excessive use of force over the past two and a half years. Police killed at least 846 protestors in January 2011. But of 38 officers sent to trial for the killings, only two have been sentenced and jailed. Now Egypt has once again descended into spasms of violence. Over the last two weeks in Alexandria and Cairo, armed Muslim Brotherhood supporters have fired automatic weapons on anti-Morsy protesters who are armed with rocks and Molotov cocktails while police and army have stood and watched. Neighborhood protection groups in both cities have engaged in hours-long combat with armed Morsy supporters who marched through their communities damaging property and harassing passersby. In the grim corridors of Cairo's public hospitals and the dusty courtyard of the city's morgue, grieving relatives and friends described watching army and police officers use deadly force against demonstrators in front of the Republican Guard headquarters, where the deposed president was allegedly being held. Fifty-one people were killed on the morning of July 8. The pattern that emerges is this: In every instance, police and sometimes army troops have acted in a partisan fashion, using what appears to be largely unwarranted force against mostly unarmed Brotherhood supporters at sit-ins, yet doing little to intervene when opposing camps clash violently. A group of outraged women in Manial, a leafy island in the Nile, told me how during a 10-hour street battle they repeatedly called police, the army -- anyone who could possibly offer protection -- while their sons and husbands fought Brotherhood supporters with paving stones and Molotovs. Ahmed, a 27-year-old wearing jeans still spattered with blood from the night before, told me: ""The Brotherhood came in aggressively, hitting people, cars and shops so that no one would get in their way."" They entered the neighborhood around 8 p.m., he said, but police only arrived at midnight, stayed for about half an hour, then retreated, though the fighting continued until 6 a.m. From his Alexandria hospital bed, Salah Haggag, an independent video journalist, showed me footage in which he followed a high-ranking police general around the Sidi Gaber train station as machine gun fire from Brotherhood supporters echoed outside, asking the commander to do his job, to call in reinforcements. The general waved him aside while talking frantically on his mobile phone. The police appeared to arrive, then left a few minutes later. Haggag's video footage ends when Brotherhood supporters shoot him in the leg. On the morning of July 8 I passed through Tahrir Square where the organizers of Tamarod, who mobilized the initial protests on June 30 that brought millions into the streets, had called for a sit-in. I saw police officers handing out juice boxes and snacks to passersby alongside a vehicle emblazoned with the slogan, ""The People's Police."" I arrived at the Republican Guard Headquarters a short while later to find the sting of tear gas still in the air and the sound of sporadic gunfire. Witnesses said that the army and Central Security Force (riot police) officers had opened fire on the crowd after trying to break up their sit-in. While some of the protesters had guns, witnesses said, and three security officers died, the protesters for the most part responded with rocks and Molotov cocktails. With 51 protesters dead and more than 400 injured, it was among the deadliest days of security force violence since Hosni Mubarak stepped down. Calls to hold the Brotherhood to account are at a fever pitch, and the military-installed government has issued arrest warrants for more than 300 Brotherhood members. But there is little appetite among Egypt's transitional authorities for the essential task of investigating the police or the military for deaths they have caused, or for the badly needed reforms in the security sector. As foreign governments wring their hands, private citizens across the political spectrum are arming up, to dangerous effect, and people are dying again in Egypt's streets and squares. Those governments need to use what leverage they have to push urgently for credible impartial investigations and accountability for crimes by all parties, police and army as well as protesters. Such steps are the only way to pull Egypt back from the brink, and to rebuild trust in its battered and discredited state institutions.

"(EW.com) -- Thirteen years after putting on the adamantium claws, Hugh Jackman is still carving up the box office as the most iconic super-mutant, Wolverine. Since opening on July 26, The Wolverine, Jackman's fifth outing as the ornery X-Man, has grossed $307 million worldwide. It's not exactly Avengers money, but it's more than enough for Fox to want to keep Jackman in the X-Men fold. As The Wolverine's post-credit sequence teased, Jackman will time-travel for a cameo in next year's X-Men: Days of Future Past. But will that be the end of Jackman's run? The 44-year-old has played Wolverine longer and more frequently than any actor has ever been associated with a comic-book hero, but his current deal is about to expire. Now the National Enquirer claims that Fox is offering Jackman $100 million for him to keep slicing and dicing for four more X-Men movies. Them's a lot of chicken breasts! Jackman's spokesperson dismissed the report, but the future of Wolverine is worth some analysis, from both Jackman's and the franchise's points of view. The Australian actor, who earned his first Oscar nomination for last year's Les Miserables, hasn't made any Christian Bale-like comments about returning to the character. When he spoke to EW earlier this year, he was noncommittal, but the door was certainly open: ""I'm not sure. I wasn't even sure after the first [stand-alone] film if I would do another. I won't say never, because I'm still loving it. But there would have to be a pretty compelling reason."" That ""pretty compelling reason"" might be introducing Wolverine to some new super-friends, like the Avengers. The razor-sharp comic-book character first appeared in a 1974 Hulk comic and he later joined forces with the Avengers in print. The only thing standing in the way of some X-Men/Avengers movie synergy is studio politics. (Fox licenses the X-Men characters from Marvel, which is now owned by Disney.) When asked recently about that crossover opportunity by Collider, Jackman was more than enthusiastic, claiming that he'd even inquired to Marvel about that possibility. ""I understand at Marvel they've got The Avengers, they've got a lot of big things going on, but at some point I just find it almost impossible that there's not a way to bring Iron Man, all the Avengers characters, Wolverine, the X-Men characters, Spider-Man, and somehow get them in together,"" he said. ""I'm in for it, I'm totally up for it because I think that would be really exciting for fans across the board."" EW: Hugh Jackman on what it's like being at Comic-Con . Playing Wolverine does come at a cost, however. First, there's the physical demands that require Jackman to be incredibly jacked. It looks great for this particular superhero role, but not every character he plays needs to be so shredded. In fact, being so buff might disqualify him from certain movie parts. When The Wolverine was temporarily shelved after director Darren Aronosky left the project in 2011, Jackman expressed some frustration because his body was primed for one role only at that moment. Re-upping for another movie — or four — means more chicken-heavy diets and multiple daily trips to the gym. The other cost is time. The X-Men movies are huge productions that block out months of an actor's calendar. Making another long-term commitment to the franchise also means saying no to other, slightly more nuanced characters that come down the pike. And as a capital-A Actor, Jackman is in his prime, at the perfect leading-man age when glorious good looks are knocked slightly askew by just the right weight of world-weariness. Since joining the X-Men, he's mixed in a few interesting performances — The Prestige, The Fountain — but you can't help but wonder about all the roles he had to turn down because Wolfie had to be fed. (Psst, Chicago and Drive...) Fox will certainly make it worth his while, but does Jackman really want to be 49 or 50 and giving a variation of the same Wolverine interview where he's describing his calorie intake? From Fox's point of view, though, extending Jackman for additional films is a no-brainer. As The Wolverine producer Hutch Parker said, the idea of eventually replacing Jackman, or perhaps rebooting the franchise with a new actor ""feels somewhat blasphemous."" Wolverine existed in the pages of Marvel comics and the imaginations of fans everywhere, but Jackman is Wolverine. It's a cinematic character he created, and like Robert Downey Jr. and Iron Man, it's now impossible to imagine one without the other. Of course, Wolverine is an immortal of sorts who isn't supposed to age; Jackman, despite all evidence to the contrary, doesn't have that ability. At some point, Fox could ask, ""Are we running the risk of our Wolverine being the equivalent of Sean Connery's James Bond in Never Say Never Again?"" But times have changed; look no further than Downey, who will be 50 when Avengers 2 comes out in 2015. I can't imagine Jackman would get soft around the middle; besides a more grizzled Jackman better suits the haunted comic-book character. The big headline yesterday was the $100 million figure that the Enquirer threw out there. It may have been conjured out of thin air, but it's not a ridiculous amount. In fact, I'd argue that Jackman as Wolverine for four more X-Men movies is worth every penny to Fox. There might be some sticker shock to the $100 million figure, but paying the star of am established superhero franchise $25 million per picture is hardly unprecedented. (Downey famously took home $50 million for The Avengers.) In fact, compared to the reports of what Warner Bros. is going to throw at Bale to return as Batman, $25 million per for more Jackman almost seems like a discount. Best of both worlds, I'd like to see Jackman return as Wolverine — but just once more, maybe twice. One more big X-Men movie, and then an Avengers crossover that could pit him opposite Downey's Iron Man. Let those two actors ride off into the sunset together. A four-film commitment on movies of this magnitude, on the other hand, has a way of stretching over another decade, and Jackman is too talented an actor to have 20 years of his prime dominated by a cartoon character, no matter how iconic.

"(AOL Autos)  -- Robert Lutz, vice-chairman of General Motors, caused a stir in the auto industry -- and in the automotive press -- when he announced in January of 2007 that the Chevrolet Volt plug-in electric car would be ready for mass production and on the road, by the end of 2010. GM has begun driving test models of the Chevrolet Volt at its Milford Proving Grounds. Because he was making this pronouncement at the 2007 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, -- in conjunction with the unveiling of the Volt concept car -- skeptics thought that Lutz's statement was a bit too optimistic. Some thought it might be one of those that falls into the category of ""speaking more from hope than experience,"" and that it was more a rallying cry for the troops than an attainable reality. After all, at the time, reliable long-term and cost effective lithium-ion batteries required to power a plug-in electric cars seemed to be years away. But now, almost two years later, GM still seems confident that the 2010 launch date will be met. And that belief is shared by many who work for some of the auto-biz research institutes/industry associations. On September 16, GM celebrated its 100-year anniversary celebration at the Renaissance Center in downtown Detroit, Michigan, by unveiling the production version of the Volt. Meanwhile, that same day, GM began driving test models at its Milford Proving Grounds. AOL Autos: Hybrid SUVs . GM isn't the only player with plug-in electric cars coming down the pike. So far this year, Ford has delivered the first two of what will eventually be a fleet of 20 Escape Plug-In Hybrid ""research"" vehicles to Southern California Edison, the utility company. And in June, Ford also dispatched an Escape Plug-In Hybrid flex-fuel vehicle -- which means it can run on E85 -- to the U.S. Department of Energy. Both of those deliveries were for purposes of road-testing the vehicles to see how they perform over the long haul. Similarly, Toyota has announced plans to build their version of a plug-in electric car and place them into corporate fleets in 2010. Plus, Nissan will be introducing an electric car for fleet use in 2010, but the company has not announced yet whether it will be a plug-in. Some obstacles still need to be overcome, but with gasoline projected to stay high, automakers may have more incentive than ever to bring a plug-in electric car to market. AOL Autos: Most-popular fuel-efficient cars . So this seemed like a good time to check in with the major players in the plug-in sweepstakes -- and talk to a research group that is working in conjunction with the automakers -- to get an update on their progress. It also offered a chance to discuss the various aspects of the march toward the electric car being not only a reality, but perhaps a ubiquitous presence on American highways. AOL Autos: Best resale value cars . How it works . The above-named automakers are each using somewhat different variations of plug-in electric-car technology -- that is, they're using different variations of plug-in battery technology and a gas engine. Let's look at the Chevy Volt first, since that's the one that will seemingly be the first to hit the marketplace: Lutz has said that the Volt has a leg up, since it draws from GM's previous experience in the modern electric-vehicle market when it launched the EV1 in 1996. Volt owners will be able to fully charge its lithium-ion battery by plugging it into a 110-volt outlet for approximately six hours a day, which for most drivers will presumably be while they are sleeping. AOL Autos: Luxury cars with best gas mileage . ""The average driver drives about 30 miles a day,"" says Tony Posawatz, Chevrolet's vehicle line director for the Volt. ""And when the Volt's battery has been fully charged, and you drive under regular driving conditions, you'll be able to drive about 40 miles a day using only the electricity from the battery. So, in that scenario, you're using zero gasoline, which is a pretty appealing proposition, given the current price of gas."" However, if you're not an average driver, and you log more than those 40 miles, once the battery is depleted, a 1.0-liter, three-cylinder turbocharged gasoline engine will spin to create electricity and replenish the battery. On schedule . ""We definitely feel that we're on schedule, that we will be able to deliver the Volt before the end of 2010,"" Posawatz said. ""We're working closely with our battery developers, and based on their progress, we're definitely on track to hit that 2010 date."" AOL Autos: Best hybrids . Eighteen months ago, many in the industry thought that the internally-mandated 2010 date was just too much to expect, given all of the technology and cost implications. ""Well, it is definitely a compressed time frame,"" Posawatz conceded. ""It is unusual to develop a new vehicle and a new propulsion system at the same time. But the analogy that Mr. Lutz used was when he compared it to President Kennedy saying that we were going to send a man to the moon by the end of the decade, not 'whenever we feel like it.' ""Ideally, engineers would like the time to make a new product that's just perfect, but the beauty of this time line is that is makes a statement that GM wants to take a leadership position in this endeavor, with all of those benefits and privileges that would come with that,"" Posawatz continued. ""There is a tremendous opportunity for whoever is the technological leader when it comes to displacing petroleum as the primary source of fuel for automobiles."" That's because a plug-in electric car would only cost about 12 cents per kilowatt hour to operate, said Mark Duvall, program manager for electric transportation at the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) -- the research and development arm of the electric utility industry. ""Twelve cents per kilowatt hour is roughly the equivalent of less than a dollar per gallon of gasoline,"" Duvall said. ""Obviously, prospects for having a plug-in electric vehicle on the road, in high volumes, are better than they have ever been,"" Duvall said. ""Back in 2001, we conducted a study and projected 2010 as the year that the plug-in electric car would be able to be commercialized, so the current schedule is indeed meeting our expectations. ""We've definitely seen an explosion in the technological advancement of the lithium-ion batteries that have been in development the last few years,"" he continued. ""We've tested some of these batteries, and we're optimistic that they're up to the task, and that they'll be ready for the marketplace by 2010. ""The current gas-electric hybrids have been an important step, because they really have allowed for the most efficient use of gasoline to date, because they've minimized a lot of the waste of fuel that occurred during starting, stopping and idling. ""But a plug-in vehicle, if you're the average driver, gives you a chance to completely eliminate the use of gasoline,"" Duvall noted. ""That would be a tremendous boon to the individual consumer, and would obviously be a boon to the environment, and would benefit the nation geopolitically, given our current dependence on foreign oil."" Cost and durability . As mentioned previously, the hurdles to a mass-market launch thus far have been the cost and the efficiency of the lithium-ion battery. John Hanson, Toyota's National Manager of Environmental, Safety & Quality Communications, thinks that these are significant challenges. ""There are a number of things we still need to find out about the lithium-ion battery before Toyota can bring the plug-in car to the consumer market,"" Hanson said. ""We need to see how it performs, how durable it is, and what its limitations might be."" Scott Staley, Ford's chief engineer for hybrid and fuel-cell technology development, agreed. ""There has definitely been progress with the technology of the lithium-ion battery, but the industry still needs to get the volumes up and the cost down in order to make it work as a commercially viable proposition,"" Staley said. And GM's Posawatz noted that, ""remember, we're not talking about a nice, clean, air-conditioned environment that these batteries will be operating in. ""These are environments where there are dramatic temperature swings, and where the batteries will be subjected to dirt, debris, moisture, vibration, and possible crash situations,"" Posawatz said. ""So the challenge was to develop a battery that is not only cost effective, but one that can also meet these rigorous operational requirements, and one that will also last 10 years or 150,000 miles."" GM is currently working with a few different battery developers, who are sharing their research, and ""we have techs testing them for hours, and there is nothing we have encountered, from a technical standpoint, that was unexpected, or that would deter us from the 2010 date."" Posawatz also noted that ""one challenge has been getting the weight of the battery pack down, and we now have it down to 375 pounds."" As for cost, Posawatz is also aware that ""the price of the first batteries are frankly going to be unacceptable, from a long-term perspective, but we're marching ahead regardless, because we know that once we get these cars into the marketplace, and the sales volume increases, the cost will come down. We're not looking at making a profit on the first Volts we introduce to the public -- but that will happen over the longer term, as they become more popular and we ramp up production."" EPRI's Duvall reframes that proposition, observing that, ""any carmaker who comes out with a new, revolutionary technology like this knows that the product will have to cross the valley of death initially, in that they won't make any profit from it. Profit will come later, after they're on the market for a while and volumes have increased.""","Car companies say plug-in electric cars could be mass produced by 2010 .

"Bellefonte, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- With the same decision announced on count after count -- guilty, guilty, guilty -- Jerry Sandusky's emphatic denials he had sexually abused boys for years became obsolete, closing a chapter in a saga that has gripped Penn State and the nation. After a three-week trial featuring emotional and often graphic testimony from eight of the former Penn State assistant football coach's victims, a 12-person jury late Friday night convicted him on 45 of 48 counts. There were convictions related to all 10 victims alleged by prosecutors, with the three not-guilty verdicts applying to three individuals. The verdict prompted people in central Pennsylvania to breathe a sigh of relief, believing a man many called a ""monster"" would pay the price for his crimes and their impact on his victims, as well as the Penn State community. A neighbor of Sandusky's said many people connected with the region and the school needed this verdict in order to move on. ""We need some sort of realization; we need the word 'guilty' -- that puts a label on what all this is,"" Susan Strauss said Saturday. Added Tom Bonerbo, a Penn State football fan for more than 40 years, ""Hopefully, part of the healing process began with last night's verdict."" Praise for victims' 'inspiring courage' On Saturday, for the first full day in his 68 years, Sandusky was an inmate at the Centre County jail. He never took the stand in his own defense -- a decision, his lawyer Joe Amendola said after the verdict, was made because his adopted son Matt Sandusky was ready to testify as a rebuttal witness that he, too, had been sexually abused by Jerry Sandusky. Jurors did hear from eight young men who testified that as boys, Sandusky forced them to engage in sexual acts in showers in Penn State's athletics facilities, hotel rooms, the basement of his home and other places. The abuse spanned at least 15 years. His conviction prompted the now grown man known as Victim 6 to break down in tears as he hugged prosecutors in the courtroom. But, while satisfied, his mother did not claim victory. ""Nobody wins. We've all lost,"" she said before hugging her son. After Judge John Cleland revoked his bail Friday, Sandusky somberly left the courthouse in handcuffs, silently ducking into a police car as reporters asked him if he had anything to say to his victims. He is on what it is commonly called suicide watch, one of his lawyers Karl Rominger told CNN. The move is a precaution and does not mean his client is suicidal, the lawyer insisted, saying the judge and warden just wanted ""to put the precautions in place first and then evaluate later."" Sandusky will be classified at Pennsylvania's Camp Hill diagnostic facility before he is likely sent to a sex offender unit in the state prison system, Rominger said. He should be sentenced in about 90 days, according to Cleland. If he gets more than two years, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections will determine the prison where Sandusky will serve his time. All you need to know about allegations, how case unfolded . After his verdict was announced, prosecutors Joe McGettigan and Frank Fina spent time answering questions from jurors about the victims and investigation, a source close to the prosecution said. McGettigan was touched by the jurors' interest and engagement, according to the source. One of the jurors, Joshua Harper, told NBC's ""Today"" show that he and the four other men and seven women were ""on the same page"" as they considered the case and testimony from ""very credible"" victims. ""The fact that we saw this corroborating story between all of them, it was very convincing,"" Harper said. Rominger said he ""could see tears running down"" Sandusky's face when the verdict was read. But Harper, like others in the courtroom, said he saw little evident reaction -- which he thought was ""just confirmation"" the jury made the right call. ""Just the look on his face, no real emotion. Just kind of accepting, because he knew it was true,"" the juror said. iReport: Share your reaction . Yet, his lawyers say, Sandusky is not ready to admit to his crimes and accept defeat. His defense team has already announced plans to appeal. ""If you win on one of the appeal issues, everything probably falls,"" Amendola said. ""All we have to do is convince an appellate court that one of the issues that we will raise is worthy of a reversal."" Rominger pointed to ""a lot of unique legal issues where (Judge Cleland) made rulings that could be overturned, not because they were, per se, wrong, but because the law in the area was so unclear."" He also said ""substantial constitutional questions"" surrounded the prosecution's ability to use an accuser's claims based on hearsay alone. ""All the convictions could come back on that ruling alone,"" Rominger said. Defense lawyers repeatedly failed in their attempts to postpone the trial. Rominger disclosed on his radio program Saturday that he and Amendola had asked to withdraw from the case before jury selection, saying they didn't feel adequately prepared to defend Sandusky. The judge denied the request, said Rominger, who added he never mentioned the issue during the trial because of a gag order in place. 'The Sandusky 8' describe seduction, molestation and betrayal . Beyond the appeals process, Sandusky could be on trial again to face more charges -- perhaps tied to claims made by his adopted son Matt or related to alleged sexual abuse that took place outside Centre County, including in hotel rooms in Texas and Florida where he had taken accusers to watch Penn State bowl games. And the fallout from the scandal is also far from over for Penn State itself. Two of its former administrators -- Vice President Gary Schultz and Athletic Director Tim Curley -- are awaiting trial on charges of perjury and failing to report abuse. Prosecutors say they did not notify police after former graduate football assistant Mike McQueary informed them he saw Sandusky sodomizing a boy in a university shower in 2002. Authorities didn't learn about that eyewitness account until years later, and the resulting scandal led to the ouster of iconic head football coach Joe Paterno and university President Graham Spanier. In addition to the testimony of McQueary and a janitor at the school, several victims said that Sandusky repeatedly sexually abused them on Penn State property. What Sandusky has said about child rape allegations . In a statement released after Friday night's verdict, Penn State signaled it wants to seek resolution -- including some sort of financial settlement -- with the victims. ""The university wants to provide a forum where the university can privately, expeditiously and fairly address the victims' concerns and compensate them for claims relating to the university,"" the school said. The Sandusky case has infuriated the Penn State community, not just because of the heinous nature of the crimes, but also because some feel the scandal has unfairly defined the university, students say. ""It's a relief. Now we can begin to heal,"" Penn State senior Karisa Maxwell said of the verdict. ""I've never seen Jerry Sandusky. He has no affect on my education. For people to say he's Penn State is disgusting. That's not the case."" CNN's Laura Dolan, Susan Candiotti, Elisa Roupenian, Ross Levitt, Jason Carroll, Dana Garrett, Laura Dolan, Holly Yan, Kiran Khalid and Anderson Cooper and In Session's Michael Christian and Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Hopefully, part of the healing process began"" with the verdict, a Penn State fan says .

"(CNN) -- Young Messiah, the ""happiest baby in the world,"" according to his mother, is blissfully unaware that a judge ruled that his birth name promises to offend many in his Tennessee community. His mother, Jaleesa Martin, and father, Jawaan McCullough, who are not married, couldn't agree on a last name for their baby, now 7 months old. That's why they ended up in the courtroom of Child Support Magistrate Lu Ann Ballew. Ballew ruled last week that not only should little Messiah's last name be changed -- from Martin to McCullough -- but also that his first name should be changed. In her ruling, Ballew wrote: ""'Messiah' is a title that is held only by Jesus Christ"" and that naming him this ""places an undue burden on him that as a human being, he cannot fulfill."" Her ruling also noted the large Christian population in the Tennessee county where the child was born. Speaking to CNN affiliate WBIR, Ballew, wearing earrings in the shape of a cross, said this was the first time she had ordered a name change. Martin, whose family is Baptist, said there was no religious motivation behind her pick; rather she'd heard the name on one of her favorite TV shows and thought it'd be a good name for her son. She also wanted another ""M"" name to go with her other two sons, Mason and Micah. CNN could not reach McCullough for comment. Heartbroken and shocked, Martin told CNN Ballew gave the parents a one-hour recess to pick a new name and then issued the new name when she and the baby's father couldn't come up with one. The judge's pick: Martin DeShawn McCullough. Martin said that she'll keep calling her son Messiah and that she has heard from supporters all over the country. She's also upset about reports she is being attacked online as a bad mother. The Tennessee American Civil Liberties Union is following the case, saying it supports Martin and calling the judge's ruling unacceptable. ""The bench is not a pulpit, and using it as one, as this judge did, violates the parents' rights and our sense that people of all faiths will be treated fairly in the courtroom,"" Executive Director Hedy Weinberg said. According to U.S. Social Security Administration statistics, Messiah was the fourth-fastest growing name for boys in the United States from 2011 to 2012. It ranks at Number 387, between the decidedly traditional names Scott and Jay. Ballew declined CNN's request for comment. Martin has appealed the court's decision; it will go before the Cocke County chancellor next month.","Baby Messiah's parents could not agree on his last name, so they ended up in court .

"(Mental Floss) -- Sean Connery wasn't supposed to be James Bond. Keanu Reeves wasn't supposed to be ""The One."" So, who were the original choices? ""I would have absolutely messed up 'The Matrix,'"" Will Smith told Wired about turning down the role of Neo. Here are 5 actors and the legendary roles they turned down: . 1. THE ROLE: James Bond in ""Dr. No"" WHO LET IT GET AWAY: Cary Grant . Despite being Bond producer Albert Broccoli's best man, Grant said, ""I don't"" to the offer, and Sean Connery got the role instead. Of course, many studio executives objected to the decision, and even Bond creator Ian Fleming said Connery ""wasn't exactly what I had in mind."" REGRETTABILITY METER: Low . By the 1960s, Cary Grant already had a spectacular film career. If he'd accepted the role (as Broccoli later revealed), it would've been just a one-movie deal. Mental Floss: Name that 007 tune . 2. THE ROLE: Neo in ""The Matrix"" WHO LET IT GET AWAY: Will Smith turned it down to star in the forgettable action flick ""Wild Wild West,"" and the part went to Reeves. REGRETTABILITY METER: Low . In an interview with Wired, Smith said, ""I would have absolutely messed up 'The Matrix.' At that point I wasn't smart enough as an actor to let the movie be -- whereas Keanu was."" 3. THE ROLE: Vincent Vega in ""Pulp Fiction"" WHO LET IT GET AWAY: Michael Madsen, who was stuck in lengthy rehearsals for ""Wyatt Earp."" John Travolta got the role instead and, almost overnight, transformed from a Hollywood has-been into one of the most bankable stars in the business. REGRETTABILITY METER: High . Madsen called ""Wyatt Earp"" a ""big waste of time."" Mental Floss: Kim Jong Il, the director he kidnapped, and the awful Godzilla film they made together . 4. THE ROLE: Gandalf in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy . WHO LET IT GET AWAY: Sean Connery, who'd never read the J.R.R. Tolkien series and claimed he ""didn't understand the script."" (Can you say karma?) REGRETTABILITY METER: High . In return for playing the role, New Line Cinema offered the Scottish actor up to 15 percent of worldwide box office receipts, which would have earned Connery more than any actor had ever been paid for a single role -- as much as $400 million. 5. THE ROLES: Sundance in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle in ""The French Connection,"" and Captain Benjamin Willard in ""Apocalypse Now"" WHO LET THEM GET AWAY: Steve McQueen . REGRETTABILITY METER: Tragically high . McQueen turned down the role of Sundance simply because costar Paul Newman refused to give him top billing. Later, McQueen declined the lead in ""The French Connection"" because he felt the part was too similar to the tough cop he'd played in 1968's ""Bullitt."" Gene Hackman took the part and won an Oscar for it. And finally, in 1978, McQueen told ""Apocalypse Now"" director Francis Ford Coppola to shove off when he was offered the lead. McQueen's non-negotiable asking price was $3 million; plus, he didn't feel like spending four months shooting in the Philippine jungle.

"(CNN) -- It's been underway for barely over a week, but Australia's election campaign is already drawing attention worldwide following a string of embarrassing gaffes from candidates. Tony Abbott -- the opposition leader who hopes to unseat Kevin Rudd as prime minister on September 7 -- has been the worst offender, with a series of missteps that have threatened to derail his center-right Liberal Party's momentum. Opinion polls have Abbott's coalition marginally ahead of Rudd's center-left Labor Party by 52 points to 48. The most serious blunder came on Tuesday when Abbott praised a female candidate's ""sex appeal"" while campaigning in the Western Sydney seat of Lindsay. ""They're young, feisty, I think I can probably say have a bit of sex appeal, and they're just very connected with the local area,"" he told reporters, when asked what qualities local candidate, Fiona Scott, had in common with a previous MP. The remarks were seized upon by feminists and other critics as evidence that Abbott holds outdated attitudes towards women, an allegation previously made by former Prime Minster Julia Gillard, who once told the Australian parliament: ""If (Abbott) wants to know what misogyny looks like in modern Australia, he doesn't need a motion in the House of Representatives, he needs a mirror."" Abbott's comments triggered a torrent of criticism and ridicule on social media. ""My first reaction to this statement was utter disbelief,"" wrote one Facebook user. ""I am still astonished that this language is considered acceptable."" ""These comments speak volumes of his true character, and this is not the type of personality that makes a good leader of any kind, let alone a national leader,"" wrote another. Rudd waded into the debate Wednesday, describing Abbott's comments as ""pretty odd,"" and saying any employer who made similar remarks could expect to find themselves ""in serious strife."" ""My policy is pretty simple: in modern Australia, neither sexism, nor racism, nor homophobia has any place whatsoever,"" he told reporters. ""I believe people look to their national leaders to set that sort of example."" Abbott said later he had been ""a bit exuberant"" in his comments, and described the remarks as a consequence of him having ""a daggy dad moment"" -- using an Australian term for something slightly embarrassing or uncool. But he did nothing to quiet accusations of sexism when he taunted Rudd with a question of whether he was ""man enough"" to rule out a pre-election deal with another party. READ MORE: Internet, economy and boat people key issues in Australian election . Abbott has previously come in for ridicule for projecting a Putin-esque, ""macho man"" image, including being photographed at ocean swim events in revealing swimming trunks. Images of Abbott in his ""budgie smugglers,"" as the style is known colloquially in Australia, were circulated online following his latest remarks, with a caption asking: ""Just how much sex appeal does it take to win an election, Tony?"" Abbott had earlier made headlines for a piquant slip of the tongue, when he told a crowd in Melbourne Monday that ""no one -- however smart, however well-educated, however experienced -- is the suppository of all wisdom."" A mistimed attempt at baby kissing that saw him plant his lips on the hair of the child's mother was also singled out for ridicule. An aspiring candidate for Abbott's Liberal Party also found himself the target of social media jibes Tuesday following an embarrassing on-camera freeze when questioned about his party's immigration policy. Jaymes Diaz, a candidate in the New South Wales seat of Greenway, told a television reporter his party had a six-point plan to ""stop the boats"" of illegal migrants, but was unable to articulate what any of those points might be. His embarrassment followed the humiliation of Stephanie Banister, a 27-year-old candidate for Australia's fringe anti-immigration One Nation party, who blundered through a television interview claiming that Islam was a country and that Jews followed Jesus Christ. The performance, which saw her labeled the ""Australian Sarah Palin,"" led to her withdrawing her candidacy just 48 hours into the race. The slew of political gaffes inspired comedian John Oliver, of the popular U.S. satirical program The Daily Show, to urge the United States to emulate Australia and condense its campaigning into one month, promising they would not miss out on any of the entertaining blunders of a typical election season. ""You might think, 'Hold on John, if our elections were just four weeks, we wouldn't get to have all the fun of watching the human gaffe-alanches on the campaign trail,'"" he said. ""But here's the thing -- you're wrong. You name a great campaign moment and Australia will get to it this month."" In April, U.S. President Barack Obama apologized after describing California's Attorney General Kamala Harris to an audience of Democratic donors as ""by far the best-looking attorney general in the country,"" a remark that was criticized by some as sexist.

"(CNN) -- North Korea and South Korea agreed Wednesday to reopen the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a joint manufacturing zone that the North shuttered amid high tensions in April. It wasn't immediately clear when the zone -- considered to be an important source of hard currency for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's regime -- will reopen. As part of the agreement, both governments said that the zone's operation would no longer be ""affected by political situations under any circumstance."" ""I hope that the agreement today will be a chance for South-North relations to make a new start,"" South Korean President Park Geun-hye said after the deal was revealed. The announcement came after multiple rounds of talks with the South, aimed at getting the shuttered factories at Kaesong back up and running. Four months ago, North Korea expelled South Korean workers and suspended activity at the zone, which sits on the North's side of the Koreas' demilitarized zone, as it unleashed a torrent of threatening rhetoric toward South Korea and the United States. But the tensions have since eased, and the generally secretive North recently allowed a large Western media contingent to cover the 60th anniversary of the armistice that stopped the Korean War in 1953. Wednesday's agreement also calls for a joint panel to discuss compensating South Korean companies that were hurt by the shuttering. About 53,000 North Koreans worked at more than 120 South Korean companies at the complex, seen as a key symbol of inter-Korean cooperation. It produced hundreds of millions of dollars worth of goods yearly. The closure was the zone's first since its debut nine years ago.

"State College, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- The most powerful leaders at Penn State University showed ""total and consistent disregard"" for child sex abuse victims while covering up the attacks of a longtime sexual predator, according to an internal review into how the school handled a scandal involving its former assistant football coach. Investigators conducted more than 400 interviews and found that several officials had ""empowered"" Jerry Sandusky to continue his abuse, while Joe Paterno, the school's legendary head football coach, could have stopped the attacks had he done more, investigators said Thursday. Read the report here (PDF) In a scandal that has shaken Pennsylvania residents and gripped the nation, leading to Paterno's dismissal and the ouster of longtime president Graham Spanier, Louis Freeh, the former FBI director who led the review, said top university officials forged an agreement to conceal Sandusky's sexual attacks more than a decade ago. ""There are more red flags here than you can count,"" said Freeh, emphasizing the abuse occurred just ""steps away"" from where Paterno worked in the university's Lasch Building. Freeh's 267-page report is the product of a Penn State-funded investigation, which is separate from a government investigation into charges of perjury and failure to report abuse pinned against the school's former Athletic Director Tim Curley and ex-Vice President Gary Schultz. The Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office is investigating what Penn State knew about a 2001 incident of child sex abuse by Sandusky, reported by then-graduate assistant Mike McQueary, and how it was handled. Neither McQueary, Sandusky nor Paterno -- who died in January -- were interviewed by Freeh's team and no trial date has been set for Curley and Schultz, though proceedings are expected to begin later in July. The prosecution of Curley and Schultz comes on the heels of the widely watched Sandusky trial, in which the former defensive coordinator was convicted of sexually abusing young boys over 15 years. ""Our most saddening and sobering finding is the total disregard for the safety and welfare of Sandusky's child victims by the most senior leaders at Penn State,"" Freeh wrote. ""The most powerful men at Penn State failed to take any steps for 14 years to protect the children who Sandusky victimized."" Reactions to Penn State report flood social media . He blamed Spanier, Schultz, Paterno and Curley for having ""never demonstrated ... any concern for the safety and well-being of Sandusky's victims until after Sandusky's arrest,"" while the board of trustees failed to perform their oversight duties. That collective failure ""to protect against a child sexual predator harming children"" lasted ""more than a decade,"" and allowed Sandusky to further harm his victims, the full report says. Key passages from the report . See Freeh's prepared statement here (PDF) Trustee Kenneth Frazier, head of the committee addressing the Sandusky scandal, said the school's board of trustees is ""deeply ashamed"" of its lack of oversight identified in the report. He said the board's 32 members -- none of whom plan to resign -- as well as university administrators are accountable for what happened. He pledged corrective measures to ensure that an ""event like this can never happen again in the Penn State community."" Karen Peetz, trustees chairwoman, said ""61 years of excellent service that Joe (Paterno) gave to the community is now marred."" Freeh's report outlined a culture of secrecy at top university levels, noting an incident in which janitors aware of the abuse took no action, out of fear. ""They witness what I think in the report is probably the most horrific rape that's described,"" Freeh told reporters. ""And what do they do? They panic."" One janitor, a Korean War veteran, said it was ""the worst thing he's ever seen."" He and other janitors were ""alarmed and shocked,"" but were afraid that if they reported it they'd be fired. Clery Act at center of Penn State probe, 26 years after young woman's murder . Attorneys for Curley and Schultz said Freeh did not have access to critical witnesses and came up with an incomplete report. Curley's attorney termed it a ""lopsided document that leaves the majority of the story untold."" ""A complete record can and will be made in a court of law, aided by the power of subpoena, where all of the witnesses are subject to thorough cross-examination,"" attorney Caroline Roberto said in a statement. Tom Farrell, Schultz's attorney, said at trial the jury will learn that McQueary never told his client that he witnessed Sandusky engaging in anal sex with a boy. Evidence will show Schultz did not have secret files on Sandusky and that there was no effort among the four leaders to conceal Sandusky's behavior, Farrell said in a statement. Attorneys for Spanier and Sandusky did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment. The review casts a shadow over the school's storied football program and over the career of Paterno, who was widely beloved for bringing Penn State football to national prominence. Scott Paterno, son of the former head football coach, told CNN contributor Sara Ganim, reporting for The Patriot-News, that ""we wish (Joe Paterno had) been more aggressive in following up."" ""But clearly he thought it had been handled,"" he said, referring to the 2001 report of Sandusky's abuse of a minor. ""There wasn't anything more Joe Paterno could have done because it was an unsubstantiated allegation,"" the younger Paterno said. ""I know my father did not know Jerry was a pedophile and did not suspect he was a pedophile."" Another Paterno son, Jay, told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" that sworn testimony ate- the Schultz and Curley trials will provide information that will help give the whole picture. Jay Paterno also said people should realize there is much more information available on Sandusky's acts today than there was in 2001. At a glance: Key players in Penn State report . Freeh's team discovered accusations of Sandusky's abuse well over a decade ago, which school officials were allegedly aware of. Even before the 1998 investigation, ""Several staff members and football coaches regularly observed Sandusky showering with young boys,"" and none of those interviewed ever notified their superiors, the report found. A year later, in 1999, Paterno, Spanier, Schultz and Curley decided to allow Sandusky to retire, ""not as a suspected child predator, but as a valued member of the Penn State football legacy,"" the report says. That allowed him to continue to work with children at the university, ""essentially granting him license to bring boys to campus facilities for 'grooming' as targets for his assaults."" He retained unlimited access to university facilities until November 2011, the report says. The school also approved a one-time lump sum payment of $168,000 to Sandusky in 1999. Top university officials said they had never known Penn State ""to provide this type of payment to a retiring employee."" Penn State community still admires Paterno . The desire to avoid bad publicity was part of administrators' rationale in the cover-up, investigators said Thursday. Victim No. 6: Violation and vindication . ""No one, no one, is above scrutiny,"" said Frazier when the review began in November 2011. Video: Sandusky scandal part of Paterno legacy . In June, eight young men testified, often in disturbingly graphic detail, of how Sandusky forced them to engage in sexual acts in various places, including hotel rooms, the basement of his home and in the Penn State coaches' locker room. In court documents, prosecutors say they have e-mails from university officials -- which CNN obtained exclusively -- that allegedly contradict grand jury testimony of Curley and Schultz. The Freeh review discovered the documents and turned them over to state prosecutors as part of ongoing investigations, according to both the university and prosecutors. One of the e-mails suggests Paterno had a previously undisclosed conversation with Curley about the shower room incident from 2001. Freeh's team of investigators said evidence shows Paterno was also made aware of a criminal investigation of Sandusky relating to suspected sexual misconduct with a boy years earlier. But Paterno ""failed to take any action,"" the report found. ""At the very least, Mr. Paterno could have alerted the entire football staff, in order to prevent Sandusky from bringing another child into the Lasch Building,"" where the incident took place. Paterno and the others also failed to alert the board of trustees, Freeh said. ""None of them even spoke to Sandusky about his conduct. In short, nothing was done and Sandusky was allowed to continue with impunity."" Then, in February 2001, the four men decided they would report the incident to the Department of Public Welfare; but Paterno had a conversation with Curley, and the men then agreed not to do so, Freeh wrote. Despite scandal, Penn State rakes in millions in donations . ""After giving it more thought and talking it over with Joe yesterday, I am uncomfortable with what we agreed were the next steps,"" Curley wrote the next day, according to Freeh's report. Instead of alerting authorities, Curley apparently wrote that he would prefer meeting with Sandusky, telling him they knew about another incident in 1998 and offering him professional help. He then suggested notifying Sandusky's Second Mile charity organization ""at some point"" if Sandusky is cooperative, and ""maybe"" child welfare officials. Paterno never reported the shower incident to police. ""To his credit, Mr. Paterno stated on November 9, 2011, 'With the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had done more.' "" Freeh added. ""We determined that his decision to do his minimum legal duty and not to do more to follow-up constituted a failure of leadership by Coach Paterno,"" the board of trustees said in a report that explained his firing. That decision prompted rioting by Penn State students, who overturned a news van and clashed with police, who used tear gas to break up throngs of angry protesters. Video: Coach K on Joe Paterno . Wick Sollers, a lawyer for the Paterno family, said the former head coach ""followed university procedures and promptly and fully informed his superiors."" Spanier, the ousted president, has consistently maintained that he was never informed of any incident involving Sandusky that described sexual abuse or criminality. According to the board of trustees, Spanier was fired in November because ""he failed to meet his leadership responsibilities."" Paterno defended football, Penn State in letter before his death .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- Crime-scene testimony dominated Tuesday's proceedings in the court-martial of admitted Fort Hood gunman Nidal Hasan, with an FBI agent describing the ""chaotic"" scene of the 2009 massacre. Special Agent Susan Martin, a member of the team that collected evidence from the processing center where Hasan is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32, said seven bodies were visible from the moment she walked in the door. The yellow folding cards, known as ""tents,"" that agents carried to mark evidence numbered only up to 100 -- a figure far short of the number of shell casings and bullet holes investigators had to catalog, she said. ""It was very chaotic,"" Martin said. ""There were several bodies in Area Four. There was medical equipment all over the floor. It was a pretty gruesome scene."" Army social worker thought shooting was an exercise . Investigators had to use adhesive-backed pieces of note paper to identify the evidence scattered across the floor, she said. The FBI ultimately entered 146 shell casings and six magazines into evidence from the scene. FBI Special Agent Brett Mills analyzed the trajectory of 58 of the bullets from five separate shooting locations, calling it ""the worst scene I've ever seen."" Agents analyzed the trajectory analysis of more than 270 bullet holes in the building, but could not re-create all of the paths of the bullets because furniture and other evidence was moved in the process of trying to treat victims, they said. Hasan, an Army psychiatrist who was paralyzed by a police bullet during the rampage, admitted at the start of the trial August 6 that he opened fire in the processing center where soldiers were being prepared for deployment to Afghanistan and Iraq. Fort Hood victims feel betrayed . A U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, Hasan had been scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan before the killings. Prosecutors allege the devout Muslim had undergone a ""progressive radicalization,"" giving presentations in defense of suicide bombings and about soldiers conflicted between military service and their religion when such conflicts result in crime. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. In a military capital trial, a guilty plea is not an option. Hasan is representing himself, but with attorneys assigned as stand-by counsel to assist him. Those lawyers requested to be removed last week, saying they believed Hasan was trying to help prosecutors win a death sentence. The presiding judge, Col. Tara Osborn, refused their request Thursday, calling their complaints ""nothing more than their disagreement with Hasan's strategy in conducting his defense.""

"(CNN) -- The last seven South Koreans who remained at a manufacturing complex jointly run by North and South Korea left the area Friday -- further crumbling one of the few symbols of inter-Korean cooperation amid high tensions between the nations. The workers left the Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea and returned to the South, the South Korean Unification Ministry said. This marks the first time in the facility's nine-year history that no South Korean workers are there. South Korean broadcaster YTN, a CNN affiliate, showed video of the South Koreans' vehicles, with luggage tied on top, re-entering the South. The move caps a monthlong winding down of operations at the complex, which the North suspended during a frenzy of rhetoric aimed at South Korea and the United States last month. The North's rhetoric intensified after the U.N. Security Council voted in March to slap tougher sanctions on the regime and amid U.S.-South Korean military drills in the region. The complex, which sits just north of the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two countries, houses the operations of more than 120 South Korean companies. One of the seven returning South Koreans, Hong Yang-ho, chairman of Kaesong Industrial District Management Committee, said his panel is urging North Korea to reopen the complex as soon as possible ""so as to minimize damages (to) relevant companies."" ""We hope there will be further negotiations through various channels,"" he said Friday. South Korea presses North for talks on crisis at joint industrial zone . The North began blocking South Koreans from entering the complex across the heavily fortified border in April. It then pulled out more than 50,000 North Koreans who work in the zone's factories, saying it was temporarily suspending activity there. The move surprised some observers since Kaesong was considered a key source of hard currency for the Kim Jong Un regime. Last week, South Korea started withdrawing its remaining citizens from the manufacturing zone jointly operated with the North. The seven South Koreans who returned Friday had remained at Kaesong to tie up loose ends. South Korea withdraws citizens from joint factory after North snubs talks . It isn't the first time Kaesong has shut down. In 2009, North Korea temporarily suspended Kaesong Industrial Complex several times, not permitting South Koreans to enter and exit the zone. The suspension also took place during the annual U.S.-South Korean joint military drill. But that time, South Koreans still remained at the complex. In 2012, the production value of the complex grew to $500 million; five years earlier, it topped $100 million for the first time. The average wage for North Korean workers in Kaesong Industrial Complex is $134 per month, according to the South Korean Unification Ministry. North Korean authorities take about 45% of their wages for various tax reasons.","The move marks the first time that no South Koreans are at 9-year-old industrial complex .

"(CNN) -- The Libyan government argued Tuesday that it should not have to hand over Saif al-Islam Gadhafi to the International Criminal Court because the court in the Hague, Netherlands, does not have jurisdiction in the case. Gadhafi, son of deposed strongman Moammar Gadhafi, was facing an arrest warrant from the ICC for alleged crimes against humanity at the time of his capture in November 2011. The court is still seeking to prosecute him and wants him handed over. Gadhafi has been held in the Libyan city of Zintan since his capture. The two-day hearing is being held in the Hague. Read more: Libya granted more time on Gadhafi question . The ICC has demanded that Libya hand Gadhafi over to face accusations of crimes against humanity. Libya appealed the decision, saying that he should be tried at home. Court-appointed attorneys Melinda Taylor and Xavier-Jean Keita said in April that Gadhafi has been mistreated and ""physically attacked"" since his capture. Live blog: Gadhafi releases taped message . In a strongly worded statement, the lawyers described Gadhafi as being in a legal black hole, held in total isolation except for visits from officials. He also suffers dental pain because he hasn't had treatment, and Libyan authorities have given him nothing to remedy the pain, the lawyers said. The Libyan government wants to prosecute Gadhafi itself, as it ""regards the trial of Saif al-Islam and Abdullah al-Senussi as a matter of the highest national importance, not only in bringing justice for the Libyan people but also in demonstrating that the new Libyan justice system is capable of conducting fair trials (that meet all applicable international standards) in complex cases."" Al-Senussi, who was Libya's chief of intelligence under Moammar Gadhafi's, is wanted by both the ICC and the Libyan government. He was arrested in Mauritania in March. Read more: Libyans celebrate capture of Gadhafi's son Saif al-Islam . The appeal document also seeks to answer ICC concerns about Saif al-Islam Gadhafi's well-being, saying the government ""has expended considerable resources in order to ensure the safe and secure temporary custody"" of Gadhafi in Zintan and is negotiating to bring him to the capital, where facilities would be better. Amnesty International has previously called on Libya to hand over Gadhafi. ""An unfair trial before a Libyan court where the accused could face the death penalty is no way to guarantee justice and accountability,"" the rights group said. Amnesty has said that Libya does not have a functioning court system and the country was ""unable to conduct effective investigations,"" so ""the ICC will be crucial in delivering accountability in Libya."" Libya and the ICC have been going back and forth since his capture about where Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, once his father's heir apparent, will be tried.

"(CNN) -- Late in January, the book publisher Macmillan told Amazon it wanted to raise the prices of its books sold through the online retailer. Amazon made clear it wanted to continue to set prices for Macmillan's books, as it does for most books it sells. To make sure the publisher understood it was serious, Amazon cut the links that enable people to buy Macmillan's books via Amazon's Web site. For more than a week, you could still see Macmillan books on Amazon; you just couldn't order one. Even though the two companies have since struck a truce, the showdown should deeply concern anyone who cares not merely about the health of this vital industry, but about concentration of political power in America. What should concern us foremost is not that Amazon's managers believe they -- rather than the people who write and edit our books -- have a right to set the price for books. It is that Amazon's managers believe they have consolidated sufficient power -- the company sells as much as 80 percent of all ebooks, for instance -- to enforce their will by cutting off the public's access to a publisher's books. More disturbing yet, Amazon is not alone in having captured such a position. Another company that has captured a real say over the actions of our publishers is Wal-Mart. And Wal-Mart is a goliath that has repeatedly used its dominant position to influence the content of products by refusing to sell certain books or music. Indeed, such brute use of power is increasingly the norm across our economy. As anyone who has studied the business practices of Wal-Mart, Home Depot and Best Buy knows, rough treatment of the people who make what we buy is true in just about every industry. It was not always this way in America. A generation ago every city boasted its own department stores, discount shops and independent bookstores. Power was so widely distributed that few retailers enjoyed any real power over suppliers. The consolidation in retail since then is due largely to two revolutions in our anti-monopoly laws. The first was the Consumer Goods Pricing Act of 1975, which gave retailers the power to price other companies' products. Second was the Reagan administration's reframing of our anti-monopoly laws in 1981 around the concept of ""consumer welfare."" Until then, the prime purpose of anti-monopoly laws was to protect citizens against concentration of political power. Since then, officials have used our anti-monopoly laws instead to lower prices. To achieve this end, they often virtually promote concentration of power over entire market systems. As a result, it is now all but routine for big firms, in their efforts to grow bigger and increase profits, to dictate prices to suppliers who depend on them to get to their customers. Such use of power can strip away or destroy much of the cash suppliers would have invested in new products or simply to maintain systems and skills. There is nothing new in this. A century ago Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes spelled out the dangers in a case in which a retailer manipulated the price of a drug, ""I cannot believe,"" he wrote, ""that in the long run the public will profit by this court permitting knaves to cut reasonable prices for some ulterior purpose of their own, and thus to impair, if not to destroy, the production and sale of articles which it is assumed to be desirable that the public be able to get."" In the case of Amazon, consolidation has often been presented as a consequence of new technologies. And it is not entirely clear how we can apply traditional anti-monopoly laws, many of which have geographic components, to online commerce. But any careful reading of history will carry us to analogous challenges in our past, like those posed by the early railways, and thereby to other potentially useful forms of anti-monopoly law such as common carriage rules. Also, most of Amazon's abuses would have been avoided if the people who make our products (in this case books) still enjoyed complete autonomy to set their own prices. Amazon acted badly. So too Wal-Mart, especially during last fall's book price war. Yet the fundamental flaw lies not with the decisions made by managers of these companies. It lies with viewing our anti-monopoly laws as a tool to promote a flawed vision of efficiency rather than to protect our most vital liberties. Defenders of concentration will continue to justify their use of power with claims they are serving the ""consumer."" But we should be clear that fixation on lowering prices can result in truly dramatic costs. Sometimes it is degradation of the quality and safety of the products delivered to the American ""consumer."" Sometimes it is the concentration of power over the people who produce our books and other vital products and over the American citizen. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Barry C. Lynn.","Dispute over e-book prices between Amazon, publisher a power play, says Barry C. Lynn .

"(CNN) -- The Bank of England's pessimistic forecasts on unemployment will lure households and businesses into amassing more debt, say economists, as interest rates remain at a record low. Last week, newly-minted Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said rates would remain on hold at 0.5% -- subject to ""knockout"" conditions on inflation -- until unemployment fell below 7%, a target the bank says won't be met for three years. Data released today showed that the UK jobless level remained unchanged at 7.8% in the three months to June, falling by just 4,000 jobs. George Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, told CNN that the central bank's measures were too complicated and could ""backfire."" Read more: British housing boom -- or bubble? Buckley argues that ""people may be acting right now under a false sense of security."" If Britain's economy improves and unemployment falls, the Bank of England may increase rates sooner than expected, he said. In March, UK finance minister George Osborne gave the Bank of England new powers to focus on growth, including unemployment, as well as its inflation target. Read more: Bank of England signals low rates for years . Buckley said: ""This is exactly the reason that Osborne decided to hire Carney in the first place. He wanted to find somebody who didn't need that much pressure to consider more stimulus."" The Bank of England has already rolled out a Â£375 billion bond-buying program and an Â£80 billion scheme to get the banks lending in an effort to kickstart economic growth. Read more: Central banks in Europe keep rates on hold . Buckley added: ""It would be politically expedient if they did manage to bring forward growth and achieve a strong economy in advance of the next election [in 2015]."" Asked whether the Bank of England was becoming too political by interfering in unemployment, Stephen Pope, managing director of Spotlight Ideas, a global markets consultancy, told CNN: ""I think in the more sophisticated economies the edges between what is the responsibility of the treasury and the central bank can become somewhat fuzzy."" He added: ""I think it's appropriate that a sophisticated central bank has as many levels or gears in the gear box to utilize and work with as possible ... and the fact that [Carney] has put these three knockout criteria in there means that he's not allowing them to be manoeuvred into a corner."" The Bank of England outlined two ""knock out"" exceptions that could mean a rate rise regardless of unemployment. First, if inflation, 18-24 months ahead, were to rise 0.5% above the current target and the second if medium-term inflation expectations remain ""well anchored."" Inflation is currently at 2.8%, well above the bank's 2% target. In an interview with ITV on August 7, Carney said that the bank is ""not making any promise"" on a time frame for raising interest rates. He said: ""We'd all be pleased if we could lower the rate of unemployment by creating more [jobs] sooner rather than later, and if that happens then... the Bank of England will have to take a judgement at that point in time."" Economic recovery . The UK economy is beginning to see signs of recovery as output increased by 0.6% in the second quarter of 2013, double the rate of expansion seen in the first three months of the year. Despite a more positive economic outlook, Nick Beecroft, senior analyst at Saxo Capital Markets, told CNN that the Bank of England's jobs forecast was still too pessimistic, echoing Buckley's comments that borrowing could spiral under inaccurate guidance. Beecroft said: ""They're pretty much used to embarrassing forecasts by now at the Bank of England ... I think we will reach 7% [unemployment] probably toward the end of next year."" He added: ""The nightmare scenario is that we reach one of the knockout inflation triggers whilst unemployment hasn't fallen."" Carney should have waited to see if the UK economy could continue its positive growth streak, according to Beecroft. He said: ""He's been a little precipitate in that and runs the risk of damaging his credibility as well."" Carney's style . Canadian Carney -- the Bank of England's first overseas governor in its 319-year history -- took a similar policy stance in his stint as governor of the Bank of Canada. The 48-year-old kept rates on ice for a large part of his tenure, leaving the benchmark rate at 1% from September 2010 through to his departure in the spring of 2013. Last week was Carney's first press conference as Bank of England governor and Pope said the man known as the ""rock star banker"" was right to take decisive action at his first outing. ""This was his first real chance to be his own man ... I think had he said nothing that would have been more damaging,"" he added.","UK unemployment rate remains at 7.8%, fell by just 4,000 jobs in the three months to June .
Newly-minted Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said rates will remain on hold at 0.5% .
In March, UK finance minister George Osborne gave the Bank of England new powers to focus on UK growth .
The Bank of England has already rolled out a Â£375 billion bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing ."
"(CNN) -- Right-wing U.S. Republicans are up in arms over Cuba again. Their ostensible cause for concern is last week's visit to the island by Beyoncé and Jay-Z, who were photographed in Havana, apparently celebrating their wedding anniversary. Read more: Lawmakers ask why Beyoncé and Jay-Z went to Cuba . These blinkered conservatives need to get over themselves. The 60-year stand-off between the U.S. and Cuba is absurd. It is counterproductive and harmful to both countries. It is time to end this Cold War anachronism, kiss and make up. Anger over Beyoncé's supposed breach of the U.S. embargo rules restricting American citizens' travel to Cuba is symbolic of a deeper fear among right-wingers. Two key factors have changed since the days -- not so long ago -- when Washington seemed to be regularly threatening the Castro government with Iraq-style overthrow. One is that George W. Bush has been replaced by a Democrat. As Barack Obama enters his second and final term, immune to electoral imperatives, conservatives worry he may use his freedom of action to effect an historic rapprochement with Cuba. American liberals certainly believe he should do so. The second change is in Cuba itself, where the government, now led by Fidel Castro's brother, Raoul, has embarked on a cautious program of reform. The government -- dubbed the world's longest-running dictatorship by the American right -- has even set a date for its own dissolution. Doing what ""dictators"" rarely do, Raoul Castro announced in February that in 2018, he would hand over power and that any successor would be subject to term limits. The Castro brothers have reportedly chosen a career communist, first vice president Miguel Diaz-Canel, to succeed them. But in reality, once their grip on power is relaxed, anything may happen. The two Florida Republicans who have been making a fuss about the Beyonce visit are Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mario Diaz-Balart. They are veterans, and beneficiaries, of the anti-Castro campaign that has long been waged from Little Havana, in Miami, the home to the state's large Cuban exile population. The Cuban vote, as it is known, has traditionally gone to Republicans. But Obama's approach is the antithesis of the politics of hate and division. He broke that mold last year, making big gains among the Cuban American electorate. This result suggested the polarized ethnically-based politics of the past may be breaking down, said Julia Sweig of the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations in a recent article in The National Interest. ""Having won nearly half of the Cuban American vote in Florida in 2012, a gain of 15 percentage points over 2008, Obama can move quickly on Cuba. If he were to do so, he would find a cautious but willing partner in Raúl Castro, who needs rapprochement with Washington to advance his own reform agenda,"" Sweig said. Little wonder Republicans like Ros-Lehtinen are worried. If things go on like this, they could lose a large piece of their political raison d'etre. There are other reasons for believing the time is right for Obama to end the Cuba stalemate. The recent death of Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's influential president, has robbed Havana of a strong supporter, both political and financial. Chavez was not interested in a rapprochement with the U.S., either by Cuba or Venezuela. His revolutionary beliefs did not allow for an accommodation with the American ""imperialists."" His successors may not take so militant a line, especially given that Venezuela continues to trade heavily with the U.S., a privilege not allowed Cuba. The so-called ""pink tide"" that has brought several left-wing leaders to power in Latin America in the past decade is not exactly on the ebb, but the hostility countries such as Brazil, Ecuador and Bolivia felt towards the Bush administration has abated. In fact, according to Sweig's article, U.S. business with Latin America as a whole is booming, up 20% in 2011. The U.S. imports more crude oil from Venezuela and Mexico than from the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia. The U.S. does three times more business with Latin America than with China. The stand-off over Cuba is an obstacle to advancing U.S. interests and business in Latin American countries, and vice versa. The continuation of the embargo has left the U.S. almost totally isolated at the United Nations, and at sharp odds with its major allies, including Britain and the EU. But more importantly, the continued ostracism of Cuba's people -- for they, not the Havana government, are the biggest losers -- is unfair, unkind and unnecessary. If the U.S. wants full democracy in Cuba, then it should open up fully to ordinary Cubans. Tear down the artificial walls that separate the people of the two countries and, as Mao Zedong once said, let a hundred flowers bloom. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Simon Tisdall .","Beyoncé and Jay-Z were seen in Cuba last week, apparently celebrating their anniversary .

"(CNN) -- English rock group Radiohead turned the music industry on its head today, releasing its seventh studio album ""In Rainbows"" as a digital download from the band's Web site. Radiohead is offering downloads of their new album, ""In Rainbows,"" at whatever price listeners see fit to pay. In a move journalists and industry insiders called part experiment, part marketing genius, Radiohead let listeners pick their price for the album. ""It's up to you,"" reads a disclaimer on the Web site's checkout screen. Thousands of fans who purchased the album ahead of time received unique download activation codes this morning. CNN.com received its code at 1:34 a.m. ET and had no problem downloading the 10 new tracks. The whole process took about 90 seconds. Much of the music world has been abuzz since members of Radiohead -- who finished their commitment to longtime label home EMI Music in 2005 -- announced plans to distribute their album via Web site October 1. CNN.com asked readers for their thoughts on Radiohead's release, and how much they would be willing to pay for music. Below is a selection of their responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity. Mark Austin of Houston, Texas It's hard to predict the future of someone's musical quality, but its not hard to rely on someone's past quality. I believe that Radiohead discography speaks for itself and speaks to me. I paid full price, give or take a nickel -- $10.49 after conversion. I'm sure this idea scares other artists who rely on MTV to shove an album down your throat to get you to buy it. Or better yet, rely on one decent single to carry a crappy album. Hopefully, this idea will bring back the album as well as take some of that loot out of the record labels' hands and give it back to the artists. Either way, I'm listening to ""In Rainbows"" right now and feel like I may owe Radiohead a few extra bucks. It's great, just like I knew it would be. Think I may take this lucky streak to Vegas and put it all on black. Stevey Majors of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania I will not be spending money on the download, but I will be buying the deluxe edition of ""In Rainbows"" later this year, if I like the album. If they're offering something for free, I see no moral objection to taking them up on it. ... People are saying Radiohead's decision to release their new album in this manner might signal the death of the music industry. Personally, I have a hard time buying that. Radiohead has a very large fan base and doesn't need much promotion, marketing or the other things that a label often takes care of. Getting yourself noticed is very hard if you're plankton in the Pacific. Jason Raney of Sacramento, California I'm planning on paying a hundred dollars American flat for my download of ""In Rainbows"" by Radiohead. I'm not getting the special vinyl and CD set, just the ordinary download. I believe, that as a musician, it is an investment in my future. I want to send a message. ""Keep your corporate conglomerate out of my artwork."" David Grodsky of Salt Lake City, Utah I like remix versions of dance songs and international hits, which can be very hard to find, especially here in the U.S. If I want a song bad enough, I've paid as much as $15 for a CD with just remixes of one song on it. When I can find what I want online, I really think that Apple's 99 cents per song strategy is the best pricing for me. I wished they'd check their quality, though, as sometimes it sounds like they just ripped some bargain CD instead of using a high-end copy. Higher pricing will just make me obtain the songs in another way. I worked previously in the music industry for six years and I know how much it costs to make a CD. More than 25 percent of the retail price, or approximately $4, is packaging. A 12-song album is $12 with $0.00 going to packaging, so in the end, everyone from the labels to the artists to the distributor is making money. Kris Gazsi of Carlisle, Pennsylvania I think this is the greatest way for a band to take their music directly to the world. I have been a fan of Radiohead for almost 10 years and I have never been as excited for an upcoming album as I am for ""In Rainbows."" I already pre-ordered my copy and I paid exactly what I would have if it had been on iTunes. Peter Gerr, outside of Boston, Massachusetts I plan on downloading the new Radiohead album as soon as it becomes available, and will pay 7 euros, which as of October 9, is about $9.87 in the United States -- $9.99 is the price of most albums on iTunes, and I think this is a fair price for what I expect will become a classic and favorite of mine, alongside every other Radiohead album I own. I admire Radiohead for their initiative in not only pushing the boundaries of content distribution, but for also placing the mantle of trust squarely into their fan's hands. I'm sure some will rationalize downloading the album for free, re-distributing it on [peer-to-peer] networks, etc., saying, ""Oh, the band is wealthy enough, they don't need my $10,"" but I think it's important to recognize the investment in time and creative energy a band like Radiohead pours into every album. I'm fairly certain that I'll end up with a positive [return on investment] on this transaction - how much is hours and hours of enjoyment and listening to good music worth? Surely more than $9.99. Mark H. of Austin, Texas I will probably pay $9.99 for the album and download it. As for music that inspires me to crack open my wallet, there are tons of bands I would still buy an album from. However, very few of those bands are mainstream acts. The problem is corporate record companies and the music industry itself used to focus on the quality of the music rather than the sex appeal or image that the artist now poses. MTV is at fault and has been since the late 90s when they brought boy bands and other teeny bop stars into the mainstream. As for those artists that are not mainstream, there are plenty of bands I still buy albums from. Albums that reflect excellent songwriting skills usually 100 percent of the time from the artists themselves. More important, those artists put on great, non-lip syncing live shows which make you appreciate them even more. So yeah, I say if the record companies are going to ruin the integrity of music by releasing crap, then download mainstream albums, but the underground world has plenty that a real music fan would enjoy. Radiohead, Besnard Lakes, Great Lake Swimmers, Arcade Fire, Bob Dylan, The Black Angels, etc. ... the list is infinite (of bands whose music I would buy) -- but notice that the list does not involve any crap.

"Dublin, Ireland (CNN) -- Thousands of protesters marched through the streets of Dublin on Saturday to remember a woman who died after being refused an abortion and to demand a change to the country's laws. Savita Halappanavar, 31, went into a hospital on October 21 complaining of back pain. She was 17 weeks pregnant at the time. The doctors who examined her told her she was having a miscarriage but denied her an abortion even though she was in extreme pain, her husband has said. Halappanavar died of septicemia, or a blood infection, at the hospital. Chanting ""never again, never again"" protesters marched to government buildings and held a candlelit vigil in Dublin. Vigils were also held other cities, including Galway, where Halappanavar died, and outside the Irish Embassy in London. ""I'm here today to stand up for women's rights. And I think the government should legislate and stop messing around,"" said Patrick O'Neill, a protester. Abortions laws in Ireland are strict and terminations can only carried out in exceptional circumstances. Twenty years ago, the Irish Supreme Court ruled abortions are allowed when there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother. But the ruling was never been enacted into law, meaning there is little clarity for doctors or patients as to when an abortion can and can't take place. It is this Supreme Court ruling that some Irish people now want made into law. Gerry Adams, leader of Ireland's Sinn Fein political party, has said it's time for the government to legislate for abortion in certain medical cases. Other politicians have called called for an investigation into Halappanavar's death. Her death is ""particularly tragic and harrowing, and shocking to all concerned,"" said Irish opposition lawmaker Micheal Martin. He has called for an independent inquiry into the case ""with personnel from outside the country to participate on such a panel of inquiry."" The Irish government needs to ""establish the full circumstances"" of her death, he said. The government has said it will launch an investigation, but details, including who will lead it, remain elusive. The government has said it will include the Halappanavar family in the inquiry. The hospital expressed sympathy to Halappanavar's husband, and noted in a statement that ""the facts of this tragic case have yet to be established."" The hospital is conducting a review of the incident, as it does will all unexpected deaths. The Galway Roscommon University Hospitals Group released a statement saying, ""In the case of a sudden maternal death, these procedures are followed: notification of the death to the coroner; notification of the death to the HSE's National Incident Management Team; the completion of a maternal death notification form. These national procedures are being followed by Galway University Hospital.""","Strict laws are under fire after the death of a woman who was refused an abortion .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A porn actor, who was accused of killing a coworker with a sword, died after falling off a cliff Saturday when police used a stun gun to subdue him. Police said Stephen Clancy Hill attacked three coworkers with a samurai-style sword at the scene of a pornographic film shoot on Tuesday. One of the men later died. When police caught up with Hill on Saturday, he kept them at bay for eight hours atop a cliff in West Hills, said Officer Bruce Borihanh. To take Hill into custody, officers used their stun guns on him - at which point he fell, Borihanh said. Police said Hill jumped, but also added it was unclear what caused his death. On Tuesday night, West Valley police were called to a home on Hayvenhurst Avenue following reports of an assault with a deadly weapon. The home was being used to make pornographic films, but shoots had ended for the day. Authorities said Hill was at the house, socializing with some coworkers. Then, without provocation, Hill grabbed a sword -- typically used as a prop -- and attacked one of the men, police said. When two men tried to intervene, Hill attacked them too, police said. He then left the scene, and eluded police -- until they spotted him Saturday. CNN's Karan Olson contributed to this report .","Porn actor falls to death after police use stun gun .

"(CNN) -- It's tempting to dismiss Michelle Obama's wardrobe as a topic so frivolous that it shifts the public gaze from its rightful focus on the first lady's efforts to reduce childhood obesity or put healthy eating on the national agenda. But if there's one thing we can learn from her panache for mixing patterns or flair for pairing Talbot dresses and designer shades, it's that fashion doesn't have to be frivolous. ""She's someone who has proven that you can care about looking great, and take risks in that regard, and also be an incredibly well-spoken, intelligent person who takes action and gets behind issues,"" said Leah Chernikoff, managing editor of style blog Fashionista.com. As she stands on the brink of another four years as first lady, her leadership and values should get more attention than the ease with which she transitions from slacks and cardigans to cutting-edge designer gowns. But to minimize the influence of her sartorial choices deprives the rest of us of an opportunity to learn from them, fashion consultants say. Read more: Obamas dine out for first lady's birthday . In an image-conscious society, Michelle Obama embodies the importance of honing a signature style and remaining true to it, said Mikki Taylor, editor-at-large of Essence Magazine and author of ""Commander-in-Chic: Every Woman's Guide to Managing Her Style Like a First Lady."" Developing a personal style that fits our lives and our bodies frees us from worrying about what to wear and lets us focus on what really matters. ""She teaches us that to be a commander-in-chic of your life you don't have to spend a lot of money. It's not about becoming someone else; it's about becoming your best self."" As a style icon, she has the ability to inspire the public in an accessible way that one-wear red carpet fashion doesn't come close to approximating. ""When you look at red carpet you're stargazing, but when you're looking at Mrs. Obama you're taking notes,"" Taylor said. ""We don't have time to stress getting dressed any more than the first lady does so I think it's really important to have wardrobe that you can count on that works for you."" Her outfits emphasize fashion and function, reflecting her broader platform of healthy and active living, said decorative arts historian Carmela Spinelli, chair of the Savannah College of Art and Design's fashion department. When she bares her arms for a gym class with schoolchildren, she makes headlines on the politics page and the style section, inspiring Americans to hit the floor for push-ups and reconsider sheaths under cardigans. ""It's not just great for the fashion industry, but also great for helping us get out and move by showing that the body is just as important as the moment in fashion,"" Spinelli said. Her support for emerging designers of diverse backgrounds and influences has bolstered the fashion industry's bottom line while reflecting the country's diverse cultural landscape, Spinelli said. Opinion: Obama 2.0: Smarter, tougher -- but wiser? ""When I think about Michelle Obama and how she has embraced young designers and how she is very comfortable with color and texture, it's a brilliant metaphor for the diversity of 21st century America,"" she said. What Michelle Obama wears also matters because it's history, said Nicole Phelps, executive editor of Style.com. ""Fifty years from now, or 100 years from now, people will understand this era through pictures of her, the same way that Jackie Kennedy's pillbox hats represent the 1960s for us now,"" she said. As rarefied as her address at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is, Michelle Obama's basic look is not difficult to obtain, say fashion insiders. They offered some tips to cultivate a signature style not unlike the first lady's. Develop a personal style that accentuates the positive . Owning your personal style makes shopping easier because you can do so without feeling beholden to trends. Sticking to what flatters you also helps you dress with confidence each morning without feeling the need to seek approval from others. ""Every woman in America knows that FLOTUS has great arms; that's because she knows it and she shows them off in sleeveless dresses,"" said Phelps of Style.com. Read more: Obama, Roberts get another chance on oath . Michelle Obama is tall and statuesque but she's not the typical model size. Yet she looks great in whatever she wears because she has figured out what works for her body and lifestyle and stays true to her personal style, said celebrity stylist Phillip Bloch. ""She takes chances and tries different things, but she always stays true to herself in trying a new designer or a new color,"" he said. Be fabulous and frugal by mixing high and low fashion . Even if you can't afford designer clothes, Obama's fast-fashion skirts, sheaths and dresses accessorized with a belt or cardigan show how you don't have to spend lots of money to look good. It also goes back to staying true to a style that fits her body and lifestyle, whether she's stepping out of Air Force One in a Target dress or making a grand entrance in a floor-length gown at a White House state dinner. ""She looks equally well-dressed whether she's in Target or a Talbot sheath or Michael Kors,"" said Taylor. ""I don't know any other first lady you could see on TV one day and buy (what she wore) in a store the next."" Part of what makes Michelle Obama so relatable is that she wears designer clothes but mixes them with pieces from J. Crew and other mall outlets, often in the same outfit, said Chernikoff of Fashionista.com. ""That's an easy takeaway for all of us -- buy the Calvin Klein skirt and wear it with a Gap sweater,"" she said. Build a timeless wardrobe of signature pieces so you can shop your closet . The first lady is known for working the same dress, skirt or cardigan on multiple occasions by mixing and matching pieces, Taylor said. She achieves this by building a bankable wardrobe of flared pants, pencil skirts and cardigans that work for her in a pinch, freeing her from the need to follow trends. Read more: From Sinatra to Aretha, the role of music in the inauguration . ""Being comfortable in your own skin is not about following trends but setting them,"" Taylor said. ""A woman who knows how to dress well shows wisdom and restraint and doesn't give into the fashion insecurity of thinking you need a new dress for each season."" True, much of Michelle Obama's wardrobe consists of expensive, quality designer clothing. But spending more on items made to last can cost less over time and reinforce the idea of developing a sense of style and staying true to it, said Spinelli of Savannah College of Art and Design. ""The idea of disposable fashion is costing us more than we know, so it's not a bad thing to teach people to buy something good and keep it for a while instead of throwing it out."" Don't be afraid of colors and prints . Obama has embraced mixed patterns, textures and vivid colors, but her confident fashion sense allows her to mix it up with authority. By wearing watercolor sheaths under embellished cardigans to talk to schoolchildren about healthy eating, or textured floral dresses to meet heads of state, she shows that it's not frivolous to express yourself through fashion while doing the serious work of the first lady of the United States . ""She shows us that you can have fun getting dressed up and still be taken seriously and move issues forward,"" Chernikoff said.

"(CNN) -- The shoe company Nike has terminated its contract with Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun, the company said Friday, nearly two weeks after the five-time All Star was suspended for violating Major League Baseball's drug policy. Nike did not provide a statement explaining its decision to drop Braun, the 2011 National League MVP. Still, the decision isn't altogether surprising given Commissioner Bud Selig's announcement on July 22 that it was suspending Braun without pay for 65 days -- which worked out to the rest of the 2013 season.

""He will just not be in the picture. I don't want to do a presumed death because I don't want the story that follows to be all about Ridge. This will be a Brooke story.

I'm looking at this in two phases, really. There will be a period of time without Ridge, which is where some new, interesting avenues for Brooke will come into play. But at some point it will be necessary for Ridge to return to the show. Who will be playing the role at that point remains to be seen."" EW broke the news last week that Moss has decided to leave CBS soap that he's been on since its 1987 debut.

"(CNN) -- When Edward Snowden decided to expose the administration's massive surveillance program, the CIA contractor turned to journalists he knew would be sympathetic. By approaching the Guardian's Glenn Greenwald, a liberal columnist for a liberal newspaper, and filmmaker Laura Poitras, who Greenwald has credited with ""exposing truths that are adverse to U.S. government policy,"" Snowden was following an increasingly common path for leakers of sensitive material: Find a like-minded soul in the media. And in doing so, they are bypassing the establishment press, which is then forced to play catch-up. True, Snowden wound up sharing part of his scoop with national security reporter Bart Gellman, who wrote about the government's Internet surveillance for his former newspaper, the Washington Post. But the fact that Gellman and the Post balked at the source's request that they commit to publishing all of his batch of Power Point slides—prompting Snowden to say he could no longer give Gellman the story exclusively—underscores why some leakers have grown wary of journalists who play by a traditional set of rules. Gellman has said the Post consulted with administration officials about the story and withheld some details at their request. Opinion: Why NSA spying scares the world . When I asked Greenwald on CNN why the source had approached him, he cited a history of ""supine behavior, subservient behavior in the American media."" Greenwald pointed to multiple examples of news organizations having sat on classified information ""at the request of the U.S. government,"" most notably The New York Times delaying publication of the Bush administration's warrantless phone surveillance for nearly a year. Greenwald told me he's not worried about getting caught up in a leak investigation, but if Rep. Peter King has his way, such journalists would be in legal jeopardy. ""If they knew that this was classified information -- I think action should be taken, especially on something of this magnitude,"" the New York Republican told CNN's Anderson Cooper. He added that in such major cases ""there is an obligation, both moral but also legal, I believe, against a reporter disclosing something which would so severely compromise national security."" Fortunately, there is no chance that King's position, which would criminalize journalism, will become law. Greenwald also works for the American subsidiary of a British paper, which may have felt more freedom to expose U.S. secrets than its American counterparts. (British media are more cautious at home because of their country's strict libel laws.) If that was Snowden's reasoning—and he certainly put his full trust in Greenwald, inviting him to his Hong Kong hideout—he is hardly alone. Twice in the last year, sources with liberal leanings have handed bombshell material to David Corn, the liberal Mother Jones reporter and MSNBC commentator. One was Scott Prouty, the bartender who secretly recorded Mitt Romney saying at a fundraiser that he would never get the votes of 47% of Americans who had become addicted to government benefits. Prouty not only gave the tape to Corn after communicating through an intermediary—Jimmy Carter's grandson—but revealed his identity to MSNBC's Ed Schultz. Opinion: Your biggest secrets are up for grabs . It was his ""civic duty"" to leak the tape of the top-dollar fundraiser, Prouty said: ""There's a lot of people that can't afford to pay $50,000 for one night, one dinner, and I felt an obligation for all the people who can't afford to be there."" Curtis Morrison, a liberal Kentucky activist, turned to Corn after secretly recording Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and his strategists discussing ways to discredit actress Ashley Judd, a potential challenger for his seat. Morrison came out publicly on the liberal website Salon, saying: ""I don't subscribe to the lie that activism and journalism can be separated."" That, of course, runs counter to the prevailing view in the Old Media, although newer players from the Huffington Post to the Daily Caller delight in delivering journalism with a topspin. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange split the difference when he did his massive dump of State Department cables in 2010, giving them to the Guardian but also to two establishment outlets, The New York Times and Germany's Der Spiegel. But after the Times published a critical profile of Assange, he bypassed the paper months later in releasing a new batch of 250,000 documents to the Guardian and other European outlets. (The Guardian thoughtfully shared its haul with the Times.) Snowden, like Assange (now holed up in London's Ecuadoran embassy while he ducks sexual assault charges), wanted to control the story. That is evident in the video interview he gave Greenwald, in which Snowden speaks quietly but passionately about being appalled by the surveillance state. But that personalized approach has also made him the overriding issue, an easier and more polarizing debate for the media than government spying and illegal disclosures. The same technology that enabled the administration to keep track of Google searches and Facebook postings also allowed Snowden to gain instant fame by beaming his image around the world. Once sources who wanted public attention had little choice but to approach the mainstream media; that's why Mark Felt dealt with Bob Woodward and Daniel Ellsberg went to the Times. But although Snowden opted to work within the media system, some activists now prefer to be their own broadcasters. Opinion: Massive spying on Americans is outrageous . James O'Keefe, the conservative activist who pulled off stings against ACORN and National Public Radio, didn't have to hand his undercover video to a news organization. While he has sometimes favored conservative outlets, O'Keefe packages the material himself (and, in the case of ACORN, engaged in misleading editing). O'Keefe told me in 2011 that ""reporters do a lot of stenography in this country,"" but that ""real investigative reporting is showing things for what they are."" O'Keefe's contention that the press isn't doing its job carries echoes of Greenwald's argument, from the other end of the spectrum, that the press is subservient to political power. Little wonder, then, that journalists such as Greenwald and Corn are grabbing big scoops that once might have belonged to the MSM. What may be lost is the media's role as neutral arbiter, a sense that they are holding their sources accountable even while disseminating their information. But in the age of the partisan press, traditional journalists may simply have to take a back seat to those more in tune with the leakers. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","Howard Kurtz: Liberal journalists have been recipients of some big scoops .

"Washington (CNN) -- A major online sports betting operation known as Legendz Sports, which allegedly took in more than $1 billion in illegal sports bets, has been busted, and dozens of individuals and related businesses have been indicted, the Justice Department announced Wednesday. Government prosecutors said that a federal grand jury seated in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, returned indictments against 34 individuals associated with Legendz and 23 business entities that helped facilitate the operation. The operation was first run out of Costa Rica, and then from Panama City, Panama, according to the indictment. ""Today's charges demonstrate that we are as determined as ever to hold accountable those involved in facilitating illegal online gambling by U.S. citizens, regardless of where the business operates, or where the defendants reside,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Mythili Raman. Most of the gamblers who used the service were in the United States, authorities said. U.S. Attorney Sanford Coats in Oklahoma City said the FBI and IRS had been working on the case for several years. Authorities said if convicted the defendants face up to 20 years in prison for racketeering, up to 20 years for conspiring to commit money laundering, up to ten years for money laundering and up to five years for operating an illegal gambling business. The chief organizer of the sports gambling operation is identified as Bartice ""Luke"" King, who opened MVP Sports in 2002 in San Jose, Costa Rica. The following year he moved the operation to Panama and renamed it Legendz, the indictment says. King, 46, is a legal resident of Spring, Texas. Prosecutors said they will seek forfeiture of real estate, bank accounts, a Sabreliner aircraft, and a variety of financial instruments connected to the operation.","A federal grand jury in Oklahoma City indicts 34 individuals and 23 business entities .

"(CNN) -- It's an unnerving realization: the futuristic films of your youth have become reality. The lasers that terrified a generation in HG Wells's War of the Worlds are now used in everything from DVD players to the operating table. While Star Trek's farfetched ""language translator"" is as simple as downloading an app to your smart phone. Now the slick electric cars that battled against each other in 1980s sci-fi thriller ""Tron"" have leaped from the movies to our front doors. Introducing the world's first Formula E motor race, an international competition where high-tech electric cars speed around some of the world's major cities -- all without a drop of gasoline in sight. ""These motors are something no one has ever done before -- it's pretty science fiction,"" said Formula E CEO Alejandro Agag. ""If you think of movies like Tron or Star Wars and the noise those cars make, Formula E will sound a lot like that. The sound of the electric engine is quite interesting -- it's much lower, very futuristic, a bit like a jet fighter."" Brave new world . The future, it seems, is much closer than you think. From September next year these battery-powered beasts will be zipping around 10 of the biggest cities in the world, as part of a year-long competition that could revolutionize not just the sport -- but the future of transportation. Much like traditional Formula One racing, the competition will feature 10 teams, each with two drivers, who will go head-to-head in 60-minute races. Beijing -- one of the most polluted cities in the world -- is expected to be the first to host the radical competition showcasing green technology. Other cities will include London, Los Angeles and Rio de Janeiro. Already, major motorsport teams have signed up to the ambitious plan -- including U.S. team Andretti Autosport, Britain's Drayson Racing, and China Racing -- each expected to spend between $5 million and $10 million developing their high-tech engines. Watch this: The aerodynamics of F1 . ""We're not trying to compete with Formula One -- we're positioning ourselves in a completely different way,"" said Agag. ""FE will be much more focused on new technology,"" he added. ""The lower level of sound also means we can race in the heart of major cities without the same level of disruption."" Battery beasts . As the name suggests, Formula E is all about electric power -- and that means big battery engines. Each battery weighs 200 kilograms, producing around 200 kilowatts of power. Depending on the speed, an electric engine can last anywhere from a few hours to just 25 minutes. And if you thought they lacked the grunt of traditional engines, think again. These battery beasts can hit speeds of 220 kilometers per hour. The gas pump is also a thing of the past in the brave new world of zero-emission racing. Once the battery is used, it can be charged again as many times as you like. ""From the outside they look just like other racing cars,"" said Agag. ""They're slightly smaller with more weight towards the back where the battery is. ""At the moment the electricity is from batteries but in the future it could run on different sources of energy. We're already working on a hydrogen prototype."" Green machines . Driving this new technology isn't just an era of Tron-like expansion. It's a racing industry grappling with increased environmental concerns. For more than 60 years, Formula One has raced gas-guzzling cars across a planet which is now facing not just the threat of climate change, but limited and expensive oil supplies. Two years ago motorsport's international governing body, the Federation International de l'Automobile (FIA), announced an ambitious plan for an electric car race that would mimic the hugely popular F1 series. Now as the deadline for Formula E looms, it could have a big impact on the future of car manufacturing. ""If you look in the past, a lot of development in the car industry has come from racing,"" said Agag. ""The transfer of technology is potentially very big. ""It's important because people are not buying electric cars at the moment -- they think they're too slow, with limited range, and ugly. But if you show that they can go faster, longer, you'll change people's minds -- they'll be more likely to buy electric."" When Formula E waves its chequered flag for the first time in September next year, it will be a momentous moment in the history of motor racing -- and a step towards the sci-fi future.","The future is electric -- introducing Formula E racing .

"(CNN) -- This is the day San Diego Mayor Bob Filner enters a behavior counseling clinic for two weeks of what he describes as intensive therapy. The 70-year-old is battling a tide of sexual harrassment allegations, and is hoping that voluntarily subjecting himself to the counseling will quell the mounting calls for his resignation. He has repeatedly said he'll not leave the office he was elected to barely eight months ago. San Diego's city charter does not require him to appoint an interim mayor during his temporary absence. His decision is unlikely to appease his opponents. A 10th accuser . Over the weekend, another woman accused the mayor of unwanted sexual advances -- making her the 10th woman making such allegations. Renee Estill-Sombright told CNN affiliate KGTV that the mayor called her ""beautiful"" at a church breakfast in June, said he couldn't take his eyes off her, asked if she was married, and then said he'd like to take her out some time. The reported comments caught her off guard, Estill-Sombright said. ""I said, 'Oh, thank you,' "" she said. ""I kind of felt weird."" CNN has made multiple efforts to contact Filner and his representatives on the latest allegations but has not gotten a response. 'I need help' Earlier this summer, when the allegations first began, Filner acknowledged ""I need help,"" and added, ""I'm clearly doing something wrong."" ""I am embarrassed to admit that I have failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me, and that at times I have intimidated them. It's a good thing that behavior that would have been tolerated in the past is being called out in this generation for what it is: inappropriate and wrong,"" he said in a statement issued July 11. Read the full statement . But Filner has also said he believes he will be vindicated by ""a full presentation of the facts"" and he will not resign. In late July, Filner said he planned to begin counseling Monday. In a statement given at City Hall, he apologized ""to the women I have offended."" ""The behavior I have engaged in over many years is wrong. My failure to respect women and the intimidating conduct I engaged in at times is inexcusable,"" he said. Battling a lawsuit . Filner's former spokeswoman, Irene McCormack Jackson, and nine other women have accused Filner of sexual harassment. Up to this point, Jackson is the only accuser to file a sexual harassment suit against Filner. Mayor sued, called unfit for office . He asked the city to pay for his legal fees; the city council voted against that. Jackson said Filner subjected her and other women to ""crude and disgusting"" comments and inappropriate touching. She said she resigned as Filner's communications director in June after deciding the mayor would not change his behavior. None of the other women leveling claims of sexual harassment against Filner came forward until Jackson filed her suit in state court. Who are the women?

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A group of seven preschoolers gathered at a small table in the center of a brightly lit classroom and started playing with plastic blocks. Certified special education teacher Stefanie Waldrop works with students at the Marcus Autism Center. Their teacher, 27-year-old Stefanie Waldrop, sat in the middle of the group. She periodically asked the students what they were making. Some were unable to speak, others were squirming in their tiny chairs; several interrupted the playtime to use the bathroom. The children, ages 2 to 5, have one thing in common: They all have autism. ""We come in here in the morning not knowing what the day's going to hold,"" said Waldrop, who teaches at the Marcus Autism Center in Atlanta. ""We have to be really flexible about the stuff we do in the classroom."" Waldrop, who's been on the job for five years, is one of three certified special education teachers in the Center's Early Intervention Program. Along with a group of assistants, the teachers spend the seven-hour school day moving from classroom to playroom to playground with 22 students who fall somewhere along the autism spectrum. The American Academy of Pediatrics describes the autism spectrum as ""a group of brain-based disorders that affect a child's behavior, social and communication skills."" The students at the Marcus Center are grouped not by age, but by their level of function. Waldrop is paired with children who have never received educational intervention before and have no readiness skills to transition to a public school.  Watch more on teaching children with autism » . In addition to helping the students learn to communicate, it's Waldrop's job to teach some of the basics, such as ""going to the bathroom, washing hands...putting on their own socks and shoes, sitting in a chair without jumping up, and making eye contact."" iReport.com: Have attitudes changed towards autism? Tell us about your experience . The job can be physically and emotionally demanding with a high burnout rate, according to Dr. Catherine Trapani, director of the education program at the Marcus Autism Center. Waldrop used to work with older children who were profoundly and cognitively disabled, some of whom had serious aggression and behavior problems, Trapani said. ""Stefanie was hurt. She was beaten up in the process of delivering her lessons and still came to work,"" said Trapani. It helps that Waldrop loves children, but the right teacher for this job also has to be ""reflective, outgoing, serious and silly,"" Trapani said. ""When you have to do the same thing 5,000 times and you're still not getting the response that you're looking for, if you can't see the humor in that or if you can't have a lighthearted moment, then you're going to be a very unhappy person,"" she said. Waldrop admitted there are times when she gets frustrated. ""There are lots of days that are very stressful and some days we come in first thing in the morning and we're not quite sure how we're going to make it to 3 o'clock,"" she said. Visit CNNhealth.com, your connection for better living . It helps to have three assistants in the classroom. ""We play off of each other and can tell when someone is starting to get stressed out,"" she said. At that point, Waldrop said, it is time to take a break outside the classroom. Waldrop doesn't use a lesson plan; rather, the work is organized in units. This month she's trying to teach the alphabet. Trapani asks all the teachers she employs to focus on achieving one primary goal: ""To develop skills to get children out of this setting and into community-based settings."" Waldrop said she worries that, in general, the public doesn't set very high expectations for children with autism. ""People don't expect the kids to be able to do certain things,"" she said. ""But if you work with them, most of our kids do pretty much anything that you can put in front of them."" But, she conceded, even conquering the basic milestones can take time. ""When our kids learn how to do things that most people think are really easy -- like washing your hands -- that's exciting,"" Waldrop said. ""It might take months for them to get it, but when they finally do, it is really exciting."" ""We have kids who come in that are not able to talk at all and now can hold simple conversations,"" she said. ""Knowing that you'll get there eventually is really gratifying.""","The Marcus Autism Center's goal: Teach skills so kids can move into community .

"(CNN) -- Britain is withholding a multimillion-dollar aid payment to Rwanda over allegations that it is backing rebels who have been fighting government forces in neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo, a minister said Friday. The M23 rebel group seized the city of Goma in eastern DR Congo 10 days ago after days of heavy clashes with government forces. Read more: Why the world is ignoring Congo war . Since then, regional leaders and the African Union have drawn up a plan under which the fighters would withdraw. But despite indicating that they would leave, M23 forces remained in Goma on Friday. ""The government has already set out its concerns over credible and compelling reports of Rwandan involvement with M23 in DRC,"" Justine Greening, Britain's international development secretary, said in a statement. ""We are committed to finding lasting solutions to the conflict in this region and will work with the governments of Rwanda and DRC to secure a peaceful resolution to the situation in eastern DRC."" Read more: DRC rebels say they will leave captured Goma . The United Nations and a number of donor countries have accused Rwanda of backing the M23 by providing it with arms, support and even soldiers. Rwandan President Paul Kagame has repeatedly denied the allegation. Rwandan Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo told CNN the measure was ""very unfortunate."" ""It is based on allegations of faulty reports which we have said for the last six months are wrong,"" she said. ""Aid shouldn't be used for political purposes. Peace in the DRC does not depend on Rwanda. We find this measure to be counterproductive."" Read more: Fighting worsens 'deteriorating' situation in eastern Congo . The 21 million pound ($33.6 million) sum was due to be paid in December. The international community has been playing games with the DR Congo situation, Mushikiwabo said. ""We are very busy trying to talk to both parties: the M23 and the DRC government. And we are busy brokering deals, and this is very unhelpful,"" she said. ""We have said from the beginning that Rwanda did not support any mutiny in the Congolese army. What we regret is the level of hypocrisy. We cannot be held responsible for a country that so many people have had a hand in messing up."" She said Rwanda would have to adjust spending on social programs as a result of the British decision. Mark Simmonds, the UK minister for Africa, visited Rwanda last week as part of international efforts to defuse the situation. Calling for the M23 to withdraw from Goma, he said in a statement that ""there can be no attempt to unseat the legitimate government of the Democratic Republic of Congo."" The conflict in DR Congo has forced more than 140,000 people to flee their homes, according to the U.N. refugee agency, on top of those already forced from their homes by previous rounds of fighting in the volatile region. And aid groups warn the conflict risks triggering a broader humanitarian crisis. Doctors Without Borders said Thursday that an ""already fragile humanitarian situation in eastern DRC has deteriorated further"" since the seizure of Goma by the rebels. Hundreds of people have been injured, Doctors Without Borders said in a statement. Members of its staff are helping to treat dozens of patients admitted to hospitals in the area with war injuries. Cases of sexual violence have also been reported. ""The most vulnerable are in an increasingly precarious situation,"" said Grace Tang, head of mission in North Kivu for Doctors Without Borders. ""The fighting that has plagued this region for decades has not stopped -- people cannot return home, they are being displaced from one place to another."" Tang said that the number of people in camps for the displaced has roughly doubled since the latest fighting broke out and that many of the people who have fled have nothing. While the fighting has stopped in Goma for the moment, it carries on elsewhere in North Kivu province, she told CNN. ""Even if (the rebels) do retreat, it doesn't mean fighting cannot start again at any time,"" she added. ""The situation is still very volatile. This is not the end."" Doctors Without Borders has teams in the field and more on standby to respond to any further deterioration, she said. Greening, the British Department for International Development secretary, said her agency would provide a further 18 million pounds in support for immediate humanitarian needs in DR Congo. The money will provide 100,000 people with three months of emergency food assistance, as well as access to clean water, essential household items and emergency education for more than 130,000 people, she said. African leaders who convened in Uganda over the weekend demanded that the M23 group withdraw from Goma as a condition of initiating negotiations. Mixed signals have come from M23 leaders and soldiers this week. South African Minister of Defense Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula told CNN that she had met with the defense ministers of Tanzania and Namibia this week following a request for help from DR Congo, a fellow member of the Southern African Development Community. Mapisa-Nqakula said the defense ministers have called for a hybrid African Union force to be placed in eastern DR Congo to stabilize the situation. She said that they would come up with specific plans of action next week, but that Tanzania had already volunteered to send in a battalion and South Africa to provide logistical support. She said they had been disappointed with the actions of MONUSCO, the U.N. peacekeeping force in eastern DR Congo that essentially looked on when the M23 entered Goma. ""We warned the United Nations about this and asked them to strengthen their mandate before M23 took Goma. All they could do is wave as M23 entered,"" she said. ""We are very disappointed, and it's not like we didn't warn them,"" she said. ""We saw that this was going to happen."" She also accused the M23 of multiple human rights violations. South Africa has more than 1,000 soldiers as part of the MONUSCO contingent. The latest unrest continues a cycle of violence and misery in eastern DR Congo, a mineral-rich region at the epicenter of political and ethnic conflict involving its neighbors to the east, Uganda and Rwanda. The area has been embroiled in violence since 1994, when Hutu forces crossed the border from Rwanda fearing reprisals after the genocide in that country. The M23 group was named for a peace deal of March 23, 2009, which it accuses the government of violating. The soldiers, mostly Tutsis, became part of the national army through that accord. However, they broke away from the Congolese army in April, complaining they weren't being promoted as promised, and because of a lack of pay and poor conditions.","Britain stops a $33.6 million aid payment to Rwanda over claims that it backs M23 rebel group .

"(CNN) -- A search is under way in Kansas for an 18-month-old girl whose mother was found dead along with two others this week. Three homicide victims were found at a farm in Ottawa, Kansas, on Monday, but they were not identified until Wednesday. The Franklin County Sheriff's Office confirmed that one of the victims, 21-year-old Kaylie Bailey, had been reported missing last week along with her daughter, whose whereabouts remain unknown. Bailey, and her daughter, Lana, were last seen on April 28 at the farm, Richards said. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation released conflicting information, saying the mother and daughter were last seen on May 1 on the way to the farm. The pair was reported missing on May 3 by family members. ""Our priority is finding Lana,"" Sheriff Jeff Richards said Wednesday. The toddler has light brown hair and blue eyes, officials said. She is 2 feet tall and weighs about 30 pounds. Days after the bodies were found and the girl reported missing, police have made no arrests. Investigators have multiple leads, the sheriff said, adding that deputies have interviewed a person of interest. ""We have three homicide victims that need justice and so do their families, and so we are going to continue to process through this investigation; we are going to continue to follow up on leads,"" Richards said. Investigators recovered Bailey's car in Emporia, more than 50 miles west of where the bodies were found. The other two homicide victims were identified as Andrew Stout, 30, and Steven White, 31. Bailey and Stout were friends and worked together as security guards, CNN affiliate KSHB reported.

"(CNN) -- Confusion reigns in Egypt after stunning court rulings threw the country's awkward transition toward democratic rule into turmoil. The decision sparked cries that Egypt's military leaders have engineered a ""soft coup"" to thwart their longtime foes -- Islamists who just four months ago captured a majority of seats in the Egyptian parliament in the first election in Egypt in generations. The court's decision dissolves parliament, and the military was quick to say it now controls legislative affairs in Egypt, actions that raised the prospect of renewed mass street protests. The dizzying developments sent shock waves across Egypt just 16 months after a popular uprising toppled former President Hosni Mubarak and two days before Egyptians go to the polls to elect a new president. They also raised fresh questions among many about whether the military -- long the most powerful force in Egyptian life -- would ever yield power. ""Egypt is entering into a very dangerous stage, and I think a lot of people were caught by surprise,"" said Shadi Hamid, director of research at the Brookings Doha Center. ""We knew it was getting bad, but we didn't think it was getting this bad."" He called the court rulings the ""worst possible outcome"" for Egypt and said the transition to civilian rule was ""effectively over."" In one ruling Thursday, the Supreme Constitutional Court found that the rules governing January's parliamentary elections were invalid, triggering the dissolution of parliament. In the second, the court rejected a law barring former regime members from running for president, clearing the way for Ahmed Shafik, the last prime minister under former Mubarak, to run in this weekend's runoff election. He faces Mohamed Morsi, an Islamist candidate favored by many in the Muslim Brotherhood and their allies and supporters. The military leadership, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, also announced it would name a 100-strong panel by Friday that will draw up a new constitution for the country. The moves came only hours after a decree was issued giving the military extended powers of arrest over civilians. That decree ushered in de facto martial law, observers said, just two weeks after many Egyptians celebrated the demise of a decades-old emergency law that gave authorities broad leeway to arrest citizens and hold them indefinitely without charge. Eric Trager, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, characterized the situation as a ""soft coup in Egypt."" What is the Muslim Brotherhood? The military leadership's action ""really signals it's moving very sharply against the political process,"" Trager said. Its actions are also piling on the pressure on the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group whose political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, is headed by Morsi, he said. ""The question is whether that's going to lead the Muslim Brotherhood to up its own confrontation with the military or whether the Brotherhood will use it as an opportunity to seek some kind of accord with the military,"" he said. Right now, the military and the Muslim Brotherhood have ongoing conversations, but it is not yet clear what they may produce, Trager said. The Brotherhood could seek a deal where Morsi is made prime minister if Shafik wins the presidency, he said. But if the Muslim Brotherhood commits itself to confrontation in the form of street protests -- thereby threatening a second revolution -- that could be a game-changing situation, Trager said. Experts are watching to see whether the decision reignites the huge street demonstrations that drove Mubarak from power in February 2011. It's not yet clear whether ordinary Egyptians, many of whom are exhausted by the long months of uncertainty, will consider the ruling an attempt by the ruling elite to snuff out the promise of democracy fought for in Tahrir Square. The real obstacle to democracy in Egypt . Analysts say the Supreme Constitutional Court is considered partial to the regime headed by Mubarak, in which the military played a pivotal role -- and its perceived failure to maintain judicial independence could spark renewed anger. ""Essentially, no, the court is not neutral,"" said Steven Cook, a senior fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""It is very much part of the old regime. I think you are going to see people pouring into the streets and demand change."" One young Cairo woman outside the court expressed the frustration felt by many protesters. ""SCAF has been suppressing our protests, suppressing the youth movements on the ground, they have been arresting thousands of us,"" she said, referring to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. But Amre Moussa, who was a foreign minister under Mubarak, was chief of the Arab League, and most recently a presidential candidate, played down the impact of the ruling on parliament. ""It is not a political move or a decision by the SCAF, it is a legal matter that has been referred to the tribunal, by individuals, by other parties,"" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. As for the wrangling over who will write the new constitution, Moussa said it is not of crucial importance. ""The current constitutional declaration is enough to give the president the powers he needs,"" he said. ""I believe that the president, once elected, knows exactly the powers he will use."" Photos: A look back at Egypt's uprisings . Following the court decision, Egypt's interim military rulers declared full legislative authority, creating anxiety and uncertainty about the country's future. It was just on January 23 -- two days before the anniversary of the birth of a revolution that eventually toppled Mubarak -- when the military surrendered legislative powers to the first parliament in the country's history to be dominated by Islamists, whose two parties won about 70% of the seats in the lower house. The military is considered by many to be a bulwark against the power and influence of Islamists in Egypt. And some who fear the Muslim Brotherhood has gained too much strength may welcome this knock to the confidence built from its successes in the parliamentary vote. ""With parliamentary elections, there was this sense that the Brotherhood could now go for broke,"" Cook said. ""They seem to have been outmaneuvered by the military and courts and associated supporters of the old regime. It may be time to make a deal to preserve themselves to fight longer."" All eyes will be on the conduct and outcome of the runoff this weekend. Taken together, the military leadership's actions indicate ""there's a high likelihood of Shafik being aided to victory by the military,"" Trager said. But Khaled Fahmy, a professor at American University in Cairo, told Amanpour that people are ""very confused"" and split over who to back. ""Ahmed Shafik made a very powerful speech today, he tried to calm many people,"" he said. ""But there is a lot of sympathy I think now for the Muslim Brotherhood -- there's a lot of fear of what Shafik is capable of doing. ""And because things now have become so clear and the gloves are off, people see what the military is intent on doing. Yesterday's ruling by the minister of justice giving the military police these excessive rights, this is a serious militarization of Egyptian society, that we made the revolution against."" Fahmy said he believes blunders by the Muslim Brotherhood are partly to blame for its current weakened position. The Brotherhood has failed to get results in parliament, where its lawmakers have been ""cocky"" toward liberal forces, he said, and also failed to realize just how deep the military's influence runs through Egypt's intelligence and security services -- the so-called deep state. The ""legal coup"" pulled off by the military is just the latest front in a long-running battle for dominance between the two sides, he said. ""This has been in the offing for not only months, but for years and years,"" Fahmy said. ""The events of today and indeed the past few weeks have shown very clearly the determination by SCAF to oust the Muslim Brotherhood altogether, and to deny it serious victories that it had won legitimately through by ballot boxes -- and today is the culmination of that struggle.""

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama fought back and Republican challenger Mitt Romney mostly stood his ground in a bruising, argumentative debate three weeks before Election Day. With a third and final debate to go, both candidates appeared likely to secure their standing in an already tight race that portends a cliffhanger presidential vote. Read a version of this story in Arabic . On Wednesday, both campaigns will continue their focus on battleground states considered crucial to winning the White House. Obama heads to Iowa and Ohio and Vice President Joe Biden campaigns in Colorado and Nevada, while Romney will go to Virginia and running mate Rep. Paul Ryan stops in Ohio. Tuesday night saw Obama bring the desired energy sought by worried Democrats after the president's lackluster performance in the first encounter two weeks ago. This time, a forceful Obama defended his policies and challenged Romney on shifting positions on key issues while arguing his Republican rival's proposals would favor the wealthy if elected on November 6. Romney repeatedly attacked Obama's record, saying millions of unemployed people and a sluggish economic recovery showed the president's policies had failed. Five things we learned from the second presidential debate . A CNN/ORC International poll indicated that 46% of respondents who watched the debate thought Obama won, compared to 39% for Romney. The result was within the survey's margin of error, and responses to other questions showed the overall impression was generally positive for both candidates. After the first debate on October 3 in Denver, a similar poll showed Romney scored a solid victory in the eyes of more than 60% of respondents. ""Most improved -- that award goes to Barack Obama,"" CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen said, comparing the president's performance on Tuesday to his previous showing. ""I think he had a much stronger debate tonight."" Daily Beast's Andrew Sullivan, who called Obama's poll numbers after the first debate ""devastating,"" predicted the president would come ""kicking back in the polls"" in coming days. Erick Erickson, the conservative RedState.com blogger and CNN contributor, thought Romney won the debate based on ""clear majorities outside the margin of error"" in the CNN/ORC poll who thought Romney would be better for the country on economic issues. Read the transcript of the debate or watch it on CNN.com . ""In fact, while other areas of the debate may overshadow this point, Romney deftly dispatched Obama on his economic record,"" Erickson said, calling it ""the one issue that matters."" An awkward phrase by Romney in addressing gender pay inequality was creating the most buzz around the debate. Romney said when he was elected governor of Massachusetts, all the applicants for cabinet positions were men, so he sought out women applicants. ""I went to a number of women's groups and said, 'Can you help us find folks?' and they brought us whole binders full of women."" Before the debate was over ""binders full of women"" had aÂ Twitter hashtag, a series of memesÂ on Tumblr, andÂ a Facebook page with over more than 100,000 fans. The phrase was the third-fastest rising search on Google during the debate. Both candidates walked the floor with microphones in hand at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, raising their voices at times and repeatedly challenging each other's points during the 90-plus minute debate that featured a town hall-style format. Moderator Candy Crowley, the CNN chief political correspondent, tried in vain at times to prevent each candidate from going over allotted time, with Obama speaking for more than three minutes longer than Romney on the night. Obama was on the attack from the start, but waited until his final answer -- with no chance for Romney to respond -- to raise his opponent's controversial ""47%"" comments at a fundraiser in May. In remarks made public by a secretly recorded video of the event, Romney described 47% of the country as people dependent on government aid who refused to take personal responsibility. Analysis: Romney whiffs on some easy pitches . ""Think about who he was talking about,"" Obama said, listing people on Social Security ""who've worked all their lives,"" veterans ""who've sacrificed for this country,"" students, soldiers and ""people working hard every day."" The president said he wanted to fight for those people ""because if they succeed, I believe the country succeeds."" Earlier, Obama went after Romney's five-point economic plan that the GOP candidate repeated two times during the second debate, saying it really was a one-point plan ""and that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules."" Romney shot back that ""if you elect President Obama, you know what you're going to get -- you're going to get a repeat of the last four years."" Over and over, Romney repeated what he called the failings of Obama's policies including rising federal deficits and debts, more than 20 million people unemployed and anemic economic growth. ""We don't have to settle for what we're going through,"" Romney said at one point. ""We don't have to settle for gasoline at four bucks. We don't have to settle for unemployment at a chronically high level. We don't have to settle for 47 million people on food stamps. We don't have to settle for 50 percent of kids coming out of college not able to get work. We don't have to settle for 23 million people struggling to find a good job."" Town hall format leads to close-quarter exchanges . Obama was ""great as a speaker, but his policies don't work,"" Romney said. Attempting to rebut Obama's criticism of his own policies, Romney insisted he would prioritize middle class growth, saying ""it's about how we can get the middle class of this country a bright and prosperous future."" However, Romney failed to provide further specifics of his tax policy, even when one audience member asked about unspecified deductions and loopholes the candidate says he will eliminate. On a sensitive foreign policy topic, the candidates clashed at the front of the stage over the September 11 terrorist attack in Libya that killed four Americans, with Romney suggesting the Obama administration played politics by failing to immediately acknowledge what happened. Obama shot back that the suggestion anyone in his administration would play politics on such an issue was ""offensive."" When Obama said he called it a terrorist attack shortly after it occurred, Romney challenged him, and Obama responded ""check the transcript."" CNN Electoral Map . Crowley cut in to say both men were right -- Obama referred to terrorism shortly after the attack, but the administration took longer to fully explain what occurred. Unlike the first presidential debate, the town hall-style format allowed audience members to ask the questions. Crowley, the first woman to serve as moderator of a presidential debate in 20 years, tried to get in as many questions as possible from the uncommitted voters in the hall, sometimes struggling to cut off the candidates as they tried to make points or argued with each other. The first question came from a 20-year-old college student, worried about whether he'd be able to support himself after graduation. ""More debt and less jobs. I'm going to change that. I know what it takes to create good jobs again,"" Romney said, addressing the first-time voter. ""When you come out in 2014 -- I presume I'm going to be president -- I'm going to make sure you get a job."" Test your knowledge with debate trivia . Later questions addressed immigration, with Romney saying Obama failed to deliver on a promise to pass a major immigration overhaul while the president said Romney backed conservative positions such as opposing a measure that gives some children of unregistered immigrants a path to legal status. Obama repeated his past criticism that Romney's tax plan doesn't add up, saying ""when he's asked how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are you going to close, he can't tell you."" ""You're going to be paying for it,"" Obama said of middle class taxpayers. ""You're going to lose some deductions, and you can't buy the sales pitch. Nobody who's looked at it that's serious actually believes it adds up."" Funniest tweets on the second presidential debate . Romney, meanwhile, repeatedly insisted his plan won't raise taxes for middle class Americans but also won't raise or lower the tax burden on the wealthy, in contrast to Obama's proposal to let tax rates on the top 2% of wage earners return to higher tax rates from the Clinton era. The president needed a strong debate to try to blunt Romney's rise in the polls after their first showdown. The most recent CNN ""poll of polls"" -- an aggregate of the latest major surveys -- showed Romney with a slight edge nationally at 48%-47%. In the battleground states considered up-for-grabs, polls show Romney has narrowed Obama's lead or caught the president. The Obama campaign conceded he had a bad night in the first debate and promised a more aggressive approach in New York. A third and final debate focusing on foreign policy will take place October 22 in Florida. Polls show voters consider the economy to be the most important election issue. Where they stand: The candidates and issues . Unemployment fell below 8% in September for the first time since the month Obama took office in 2009. However, continuing high unemployment and slow growth have made the president vulnerable. Romney and his campaign have sought to frame the election as a referendum on Obama's presidency, citing joblessness, slow recovery from the recession and chronic federal deficits and debt as reasons to deny a second term. For their part, Obama and Democrats have tried to make the election about competing visions for the future. They argue Republican proposals to repeal major legislation, such as health care and Wall Street reforms, while cutting government and expanding tax cuts without identifying additional revenue sources would stall a sluggish but steady recovery.

"(CNN) -- We receive them almost on a daily basis; text messages alerting us that our taxi is outside or our dentist appointment is tomorrow. To us they are just alerts, gentle reminders for our busy diaries. For the company that creates the platform and those that use it, these messages are both money generators and cash savers. Esendex, a mobile messaging service provider based in Nottingham, has been creating the means for clients to send a text message for more than eleven years. More Marketplace Europe: Tracking love . Today, with 17,000 customers throughout Europe, the company is expanding to new markets and learning to be German, French and Spanish. In other words, it's learning to be international. Its CEO Julian Hucker tells me, during a visit to their offices, that this has meant ""adhering to some onerous rules around SPAM messaging"" in France and other key Euroepan Union regulations. Out of all their international markets, Spain has surprised them the most. In the midst of an economic crisis and with unemployment at record highs, Spanish companies have been turning to Esendex to help them do more with less. Julian tells me companies are looking for inexpensive and alternative ways to communicate with their customers. They are looking, he says, to innovate their way out of trouble. For Esendex, who has been signing up more customers in Spain than anywhere else, the economic crisis has been a huge opportunity. More Marketplace Europe: Cornish pasties fill hunger for jobs . Last year, Esendex's profits totalled $15 million. Spain accounted for 15% of those sales and from July to December of that same year, the Spanish market grew 39%. Esendex has 2,000 customers in Spain alone. The Centro de Hemoterapia y Hemodonacion, better known as CHEMCYL, is one of them. The blood donor bank based in the region of Castilla y Leon has a blood bus that travels to small cobbled towns and big cities, enticing passers-by to donate blood. But there's little hanging around or time wasted. Using Esendex's SMS platform, CHEMCYL sends text messages to donors on their list, alerting them as to when the blood bus will be visiting and where they can donate. By receiving the text message the night before, donors are more likely to remember and make time in their schedule to stop and donate blood. I saw the bus in action in Valladolid, when it stopped at the university square. In the few hours of the morning I visited, the bus received more than 17 donations, mostly all thanks to the text message they had sent out the previous night. For CHEMCYL, who made a switch from sending half a million letters to SMS, this has meant a saving of $229,000 -- money they can invest in medical research and other new projects. So the message is clear: In tough economic times, try to do less with more. It seems you only need a few dozen words.","Text message alerts are now an everyday occurrence .

"(CNN) -- EasyJet's new London to Moscow route is an opportunity to attract more business travelers, according to the low cost airline's chief executive. In an interview with CNN's Nina Dos Santos, Carolyn McCall estimates that about one third of passengers on the four hour flight from London to Moscow would be traveling on business. The British carrier -- known for its bargain basement flights and tangerine-colored aircraft -- beat seven other airline giants to secure the rights to the London-Moscow route. But McCall tells CNN: ""We were convinced we had a good shot with this; we have a very credible position for business passengers... all the other airlines were focused on Heathrow not Gatwick and were very much focused on the front cabin and the premium experience."" McCall -- who was appointed CEO in July 2010 -- says the biggest challenge facing the company today is maintaining cost advantage over its competitors. She says: ""Our biggest cost after fuel is airports; there is a huge focus from us on making sure we only pay an airport for what we use."" Efficiency and low operation overheads are central to the airline's business model, according to McCall. ""I think it is very difficult for legacy carriers to compete with us on price and fares because they don't have the cost structure that we have.""","EasyJet boss McCall estimates about one third of passengers on the flight from London to Moscow .

"School's out and the kids are playing outside. How much do you have to worry about them getting sick? Here are some concerns you may have, and some you may not know about. Don't worry about your kid getting the skin infection impetigo in a pool; it can't be spread in water. Mom worry: Can't mosquito bites be life-threatening because of West Nile virus? Facts: Unlikely. Ever since West Nile virus came on the scene in the U.S. in 1999, many moms have worried about every mosquito bite their children get. No need to stress: While anyone can get West Nile virus, it's not a big threat to kids. ""The majority of children who get this virus have no symptoms -- or they get aches, pains, and fever that go away within a few days,"" says Robert Frenck, Jr., M.D., professor of pediatrics at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center in Ohio and member of the American Academy of Pediatrics's (AAP) committee on infectious diseases. And fortunately, kids rarely develop serious complications such as encephalitis (a potentially dangerous brain inflammation). To lower your child's chances of being bitten, though, get rid of standing water in your yard (think empty flowerpots and wading pools) -- a prime breeding ground for mosquitoes. And, of course, dress your child in a long-sleeved top and pants when you can, apply a DEET-containing insect repellent (the AAP advises one with a DEET concentration of no more than 30 percent for children), and consider keeping him inside around dusk, when the bugs come out in full force.  Parenting.com: Baby summer safety guide . Mom worry: Could my child get impetigo from the swimming pool? Facts: Not a concern. This bacterial skin infection, characterized by itchy blisters, scabs, or sores, is spread by direct contact with someone who's infected or from sharing contaminated towels or clothes -- not from water. ""Kids get impetigo more often in the summer because they get cuts, scrapes, and bug bites then, which leave them particularly vulnerable to bacterial infections,"" says Robert Baltimore, M.D., a professor of pediatrics in the infectious diseases division at the Yale University Medical School. Once your child is exposed to impetigo, it can take two to three days to develop symptoms. If it's limited to a small area, your doctor may suggest a topical over-the-counter antibiotic such as bacitracin or a prescription-strength antibiotic like Bactroban. Either of these may be enough to cure the infection and prevent it from spreading. Parenting.com: The savvy mom's guide to sun safety . If the infection is extensive, has already spread, or doesn't respond to the topical ointment, oral antibiotics are used for seven to10 days. Because of the recent increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), watch your child's symptoms carefully to make sure the condition improves after the first course of antibiotics. If it doesn't, tell your doctor quickly; he'll need to prescribe an appropriate antibiotic if a culture indicates that the infection is due to MRSA. Mom worry: If my child gets hand, foot, and mouth disease, will she be scarred by the rash spreading all over her body? Facts: Nope. The small, red blisters that appear on the hands, feet, and often the throat with hand, foot, and mouth disease usually look a lot worse than they are, and they won't spread or cause scarring. In fact, the spots will naturally disappear when the Coxsackie virus that causes the illness runs its course, usually in about five days. In the meantime, though, the virus is highly contagious. ""We often see outbreaks of the Coxsackie virus in day camps during the summer,"" says Robert Fink, M.D., an associate professor of clinical pediatrics at the Eastern Virginia Medical School, in Norfolk. This is because it can be caught from hand-to-hand contact (for instance, when kids are in close quarters at camp) and from saliva, which kids are exposed to when playing together in the pool or with water toys. Parenting.com: A no-panic guide to health scares . If your child does catch hand, foot, and mouth disease, she may have a fever and a nasty sore throat, so make her as comfortable as possible by giving her acetaminophen or ibuprofen for the fever and pain. Also, encourage her to eat ice pops and drink whatever she's willing to swallow -- including watered-down juice and milk shakes -- to prevent dehydration, which is often a concern when a sore throat is severe. If you're worried your child is dehydrated, call your pediatrician. Mom worry: Is eating a hamburger that's not cooked enough a surefire way to get food poisoning? Facts: Not necessarily. While an undercooked hamburger is a concern when it comes to food poisoning -- courtesy of the infamous E. coli bacteria -- an increasing number of food-borne illnesses are actually caused by produce. That's because bacteria can be spread from animal products to fruits and vegetables through contaminated water or soil -- and, of course, there can be cross-contamination in the kitchen. And once the bugs are there, they often stick tenaciously to the textured surfaces of produce, ultimately making you or your kids sick. Summer is a particularly dangerous time: When people bring food to parks and beaches, and don't keep it cool, bacteria can grow and multiply even more quickly. Parenting.com: The truth about superbugs . The fix? Practice excellent hygiene when preparing food. • Scrub your hands with soap and warm water before touching any food -- and do it again before switching from handling meat to making a salad, for example. • Wash whatever produce you buy, and don't assume it's clean because it's in an individual container or package. To prevent bacteria on the outside from getting inside, wash the outer shell of melons and the like before slicing into them. • Have separate cutting boards -- one for meats, one for produce, and one for breads. • Always keep perishable food refrigerated until it's going to be eaten. • If your child does get a food-borne illness, she'll probably experience diarrhea, cramping, and perhaps vomiting, sometimes along with a fever, usually for two to three days. To keep her hydrated, give her plenty of fluids, especially electrolyte solutions (such as Pedialyte), clear sodas like ginger ale, or white grape juice. Parenting.com: Kids and germs  • If the symptoms persist or if her eyes become sunken, her mouth is very dry, or she becomes listless, call your doctor right away -- she may need intravenous fluids to replace those she's lost. Also, if your child has bloody diarrhea, take her to the doctor immediately; this is a sign that she could have a more serious infection that may require quick treatment with antibiotics.

"(CNN) -- Turkey is a ""source of inspiration"" to show how Islam and democracy can go hand-in-hand, the country's deputy prime minister has told CNN. In an interview with Richard Quest, Ali Bababcan -- deputy to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan -- said the country had been able to demonstrate how ""Islam and democracy can function together.""

Read more: Finnish PM: Eurozone nations must follow the rules . Babacan said Turkey -- a country flanked by Europe and Middle East hotspots such as Syria and Iraq -- is subscribing to the western-style democracy. He said the EU acts as a ""very important external anchor"" on issues such as democracy and human rights. Turkey's economic performance, however, stands in stark contrast to many countries within Europe. The International Monetary Fund expects Turkey to grow 3.5% this year, while many European countries suffer prolonged recessions. Read more: GE Europe chief eyes investment in Germany . Turkey -- a country of 74 million people -- is one of Europe's fastest growing economies and is attracting investment from industries including automotive, power, construction and defense. This has prompted some to question Turkey's drive to be part of the EU, instead pointing to its potential as a bridge between the East and West. Philipp Reuter, director for Turkey at business consultancy Frost & Sullivan, told CNN that it is not necessary for Turkey to become a fully-fledged member of the union. He said Turkey has more to gain economically by aligning itself with a region historically known as ""Levant,"" and to which he has added North Africa. The region includes countries such as Iraq in the Middle East to Algeria in North Africa. Read more: No brakes on growth at Brembo .

""We believe the EU should be more of a global entity and Turkey will contribute its position as a real global actor, not a European project, but more of a global project,"" he said. Babacan points to Turkey's services industry and banking sector as an example for Europe and the eurozone's embattled single currency.

"(CNN) -- It is said that the devil would never dare cross the River Tamar into Cornwall for fear of ending up as a filling in a Cornish pasty. The legend, it seems, could just be true.

Read more: Could emerging markets be Lindt's new sweet spot? And what began as a humble and hearty meal for tired and starving miners continues to fill local mouths as well as local industry.

Despite the numbers and the competition, this is a local business -- with farmers, butchers and bakers all playing a part.

My visit to Ginsters, Cornwall's largest pasty producer, is a perfect example of this.

At a bakery in the town of St. Just, where pasties are still made by hand, there is a sense of pride in every pasty that is filled and crimped.

It has taken more than eight years for the Cornish pasty to win official recognition protection under the Europen Union's protected food names scheme, or PGI, as it's also known. While the scheme allows it a place among parma ham, Champagne and stilton cheese, the benefits for the region are more substantial. The new title provides European funding which helps some businesses and suppliers invest in their facilities, ultimately generating jobs. As I tuck into my pasty, I realize the potential for growth beyond the Cornish shores. In the next couple months, I am told, Warren's Bakery will be shipping their pasties to Germany, Canada and even some Scandinavian countries.

"(CNN) -- A grey day in Brussels provided an apt backdrop for addressing the bleak job prospects facing Europe's younger generations. With a quarter of their 16 to 25 year-olds out of work, youth unemployment has become one of the most pressing issues facing EU leaders today. Among the potential solutions tabled was using the European Investment Bank as a mechanism for providing small businesses with loans, so they can hire. Job and training guarantee schemes were also agreed by member states as well as a plan to roll out 6 billion euros ($7.8 billion) to the hardest hit countries like Greece and Spain where more than half of the young workforce is standing idle. But the funds committed so far are a drop in the ocean compared to the size of the problem. And unless the initiatives are backed up by complementary policies in individual nations, the EU's June summit is likely to deliver patchy results. Youth unemployment is a tricky subject, especially for the EU which was partly conceived to ensure free movement of labor, goods and services. Without growth it's hard to see companies hiring at the moment. But even when the economy improves there's no guarantee the region's so-called lost generation will get on the job ladder either. Studies by the International Labour Organization have shown those who have trouble finding work initially often end up stuck with lower wages for years to come as they give up on their dream and settle for a different career. Speaking on the sidelines of the summit, Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt said he reckoned at least half of the EU funds agreed will be directed towards Greece, Spain and Italy where the issue is more acute. Whilst, throwing money at the problem may alleviate the symptoms, it won't necessarily provide a cure. EU Employment Commissioner Lazlo Andor says 'there is no silver bullet' for the region's jobless problem. And he's right. It's up to each member state - not the commission - to create the conditions for hiring. Yet Brussels is paying the price for its obsession with austerity. After demanding cuts in the age of austerity, politicians didn't seem to realize they'd have to support the private sector to provide jobs for people left unemployed in the public sector. Cutting red tape for businesses and covering employers' social security contributions would be one way of encouraging firms to take on staff, as Lithuania has learned. Such measures helped the Baltic state to slash its under-25 jobless tally by 4%, the most anywhere in the EU. Yet just as the EU tries to tackle a sorely neglected subject, its unemployment numbers are set to swell again, as Croatia - with 51% youth unemployment - joins the club. A reminder for Europe's leader there's much work to be done -- even as 7.5 million of their young have none.","A quarter of the European Union's 16 to 25 year-olds are out of work .

"(CNN) -- If a measure of a successful society is its ability to prevent infant deaths, then there is an ugly truth in the United States today that public health officials know but the public largely does not: Too many of our babies are dying, and they don't have to. Public health officials, doctors and researchers from around the world are gathering in Washington this week for the 139th annual meeting of the American Public Health Association to address the pressing public health issues of the day, and it is imperative that they focus their attention on protecting the most vulnerable members of our society. The U.S. infant mortality rate is one of the highest among all developed countries. The disparity in rates within the United States is alarming as well, with black babies dying at more than twice the rate of white babies. The most recent statistics from 2007 show that the U.S. rate of almost seven deaths per 1,000 live births ranked the U.S. behind the majority of other developed countries. Thirty developed countries have lower infant mortality rates, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, all of them spending much less than we do on health care . Within the United States, infant mortality ranges from a high of almost 10 deaths per 1,000 in Mississippi and Alabama to about five deaths per 1,000 in Washington and Massachusetts. Although the overall rates have been slowly declining since 2000, the huge gap between whites and blacks continues to exist. American women who are most likely to lose their babies are non-Hispanic black women, with a rate almost 2 1/2 greater than that for non-Hispanic white women. This is one of the greatest injustices in our country: that a baby's chance of having a healthy life is largely dependent on where he or she is born. States and local communities vary widely in what care their leaders choose to provide to women and children. But these higher rates can be lowered by implementing strong initiatives at the state and federal levels. And maternal and child health experts know what needs to happen, based on what's worked in places with lower rates. Preventing infant mortality is not just about prenatal care. There are four key periods in the lives of women and their children, each vital in determining whether an infant lives or dies: before pregnancy, during pregnancy, at birth and during the first year of life. Interventions that work during each of these periods must be consistently supported to reduce infant mortality. These include teen pregnancy prevention programs, such as the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy; family planning services (the Women, Infants and Children -- or WIC -- nutrition program, which provides federal grants to states, is one good example); Back-to-Sleep education campaigns that help reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome; full coverage of prenatal care and child health; and cessation programs for pregnant women who use tobacco or other substances. These are examples of services that should be available for all women and infants, regardless of where they live. Currently, the United States does not ensure that women have access to comprehensive health care services for the four key periods. Countries with universal health care that includes women's health coverage (including family planning) before and after pregnancy -- that is, prenatal care as well as infant and child health care -- have better outcomes than the United States. We need it all. Prenatal care is necessary, but taken alone won't solve our scandalously high infant mortality rates. Policies and regulations are needed in all states and in all hospitals to make sure we give infants the best possible care. It will take a village of support to lower infant mortality and improve health and development of our nation's children. Since 1935 the U.S. government has supported maternal and child health through Title V of the Social Security Act, which demands that states be a ""point of accountability"" to ensure the health of mothers, women, children and youth. Healthy Start programs funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services since the early 1990s have helped communities provide an array of services and support to pregnant women who face challenges getting access to quality medical care, housing, food and other services. Both Title V and Healthy Start are regularly at risk in budget discussions. To do better as a nation, we must develop and sustain the political will to fund both programs fully as well as support all services and policies we know help prevent infant deaths. Continuing to provide a patchwork of fragmented services for mothers and infants across the country will do little to improve our infant mortality rates. When it comes to the budget, Congress must prioritize services that will prevent poor and minority children from dying or suffering from other conditions that result from inadequate health care for mothers and their babies. Now is the time for our society to reflect its values. We can do better for our women and children. We must.

"Cleveland, Ohio (CNN) -- Michelle Knight, one of three women kidnapped by Ariel Castro, returned Friday to the Cleveland house where she was chained up and tormented for 11 years, a neighbor said. The visit came a day after Knight came face-to-face with Castro, telling him during a sentencing hearing: ""I spent 11 years in hell, and now your hell is just beginning."" Castro was sentenced to life in prison plus 1,000 years. Knight, 32, stood outside the house at 2207 Seymour Avenue, looking at where she and two other women -- Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus -- had been held for years, neighbor Altagracia Tejeda said through a translator. Then she walked across the street to Tejeda's house, she said. It was Tejeda's house where Berry and her 6-year-old daughter fled after making their escape May 6 from Castro's house. It was there, using a cell phone, that Berry made her now famous 911 call: ""Help me, I am Amanda Berry. I've been kidnapped and I've been missing for 10 years. And I'm here. I'm free now."" On Friday, Knight thanked Tejeda and others for helping in the women's rescue. During her captivity, Knight said had glimpsed Tejeda on her porch. A couple of times over the years, Tejeda said she saw what she believed was a young girl through a screen door at Castro's house. She later learned the girl was actually a diminutive woman. It was Knight. ""Did you see me?"" Knight asked, according to Tejeda. Her answer: Yes.","Michelle Knight, 32, was held by Ariel Castro for 11 years .

"(CNN) -- The Constitution says that only ""natural born citizens"" are eligible to be president. Is Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas eligible, given that he was born in Canada of a U.S. citizen mother and a Cuban immigrant father? If Cruz runs, 2016 will be the third consecutive election in which there were questions about the right of a major party candidate to serve. Unfortunately, the Framers left few clues about exactly what a ""natural born citizen"" is; Congress has not used the phrase in citizenship statutes since 1790. Indeed, the phrase is so obscure that it has been called the Constitution's worst provision by the dean of the Yale Law School. But it is likely that Cruz is a natural born citizen, because he was a citizen by birth. In any event, even if there were some question, the courts are unlikely to interfere with the decisions of the electorate about who we want as our president. We have clear rules for who is a citizen by birth, and who can become a citizen after birth by naturalization, but neither the Constitution nor laws passed by Congress define ""natural born citizen."" The phrase comes from the English common law, which defined the term as including anyone who, by natural law, owed duties to, and was protected by, the monarch. The sovereign expected obedience from anyone born in the country, other than the child of a foreign diplomat or an enemy soldier. So children born in England, even to parents who were not English themselves, were natural born subjects. As such they were obligated to pay taxes, say, or perform military service, and they had the rights of English people. The word ""natural"" was critical. English courts found that some people were naturally subjects if born in the dominion of the sovereign even if Parliament had passed no law making them such. Simply being born naturally created rights and duties. Politics: Who is eligible to run for president? The United States had natural citizenship in this same sense; white people born in the United States were always regarded as citizens, even before the Fourteenth Amendment, passed in 1868, put that principle in the Constitution and extended it to African-Americans. Clearly, those born in the United States are eligible to be president; if they are not, no one is. There is also wide agreement that people who became citizens after birth, such as former governors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jennifer Granholm, cannot run. Naturalized citizens are ineligible, no matter how able and popular, no matter how loyal and integrated into American society. The question about eligibility has always been with regard to children of U.S. citizens born overseas, like Ted Cruz, and Republican presidential candidates John McCain and George Romney before him. The Supreme Court has held that foreign-born children are U.S. citizens only to the extent that a law passed by Congress makes them so. As the child of a U.S. citizen mother, Ted Cruz was born a citizen by virtue of the Immigration and Nationality Act. But did that make him a natural born citizen? The United States has citizens, not subjects; we are a nation of free people, not ruled by a hereditary sovereign. Therefore, the English concept does not translate directly to the American context. Instead, the question is who is a natural member of the political community. Most immigration and citizenship scholars, including me, believe that the answer is that any person who is a U.S. citizen at birth is naturally a part of the political community and hence eligible to be president. (I argued that John McCain was not eligible, because the statute granting citizenship to people born in the Canal Zone was passed only after he was born; since he was not a citizen at birth, he could not be a natural born citizen.) There is a far-fetched counterargument, that only those who have citizenship by natural right, those born in the United States -- and perhaps only white people born in the United States -- are truly natural-born because only they are citizens without some law like the Immigration and Nationality Act or a constitutional amendment like the Fourteenth Amendment making them so. All others, who are granted citizenship because of some action by Congress, are mere naturalized citizens. This argument seems wrong to most scholars. But whatever its merits, it is not likely to be tested in court. Judges appropriately hesitate to overrule the democratic process. If Cruz runs and is challenged, the courts will almost certainly rule that a random voter has no standing to challenge his candidacy. Other candidates are not likely to sue, but rather will focus on trying to win the election. Judges will recognize that, at bottom, it is hard to find a legitimate reason that Ted Cruz or any other person in his situation should be denied the presidency if the people of the United States want him. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gabriel ""Jack"" Chin.","Sen. Ted Cruz was born in Canada of a U.S. citizen mother and Cuban immigrant father .

"(CNN) -- The emir of Kuwait has accepted the resignation of the Cabinet and the prime minister and asked them to stay as a caretaker government until a new government is formed, state-run news agency KUNA said Monday. The decision comes less than two weeks after anti-corruption protesters forced their way inside Parliament in Kuwait City, pushing for the prime minister's ouster. Prime Minister Sheikh Nasser al-Mohammad al-Sabah has had six previous governments brought down by opposition elements over the years. The new wave of protests pushed not just for the downfall of his government but for the prime minister himself to step down. Many protests chanted that they want to ""overthrow"" him, using iconic slogans of the Arab Spring. While Kuwait's leaders worked to quell the protests, opposition leaders vowed their efforts would escalate. In a letter to the emir announcing his resignation, the prime minister said ""negative practices"" of a minority of members of Parliament made progress impossible, according to KUNA. He accused the parliamentarians of promoting disunity, doubting the integrity of the country's leaders and fabricating unfounded accusations. ""Therefore, under these circumstances, it has become impossible for the government to pursue shouldering its responsibilities and fulfilling duties,"" he wrote, according to KUNA.","NEW: Prime minister accuses some members of Parliament of sowing disunity .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The man dubbed the ""Taliban American"" is asking the president to commute the remaining years of his federal prison sentence, according to a statement released by his attorneys Wednesday. John Walker Lindh is hoping that President Bush will commute the rest of his 20-year sentence. John Walker Lindh, a 27-year-old Californian, has served seven years of a 20-year sentence after being captured in Afghanistan in 2001. He joined the Taliban to fight in the country's civil war one month before the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan, according to the statement. He originally was indicted on 10 charges, including conspiring to kill American citizens, but the U.S. Justice Department dismissed terrorism-related charges in 2002. Lindh pleaded guilty to serving in the Taliban army and carrying weapons while fighting the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance. Along with the plea, he signed a gag order that prevented him from doing interviews. His lawyers say Lindh never fought against American forces and received a harsher sentence because sentencing occurred after the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York, Washington and rural Pennsylvania. Lindh's attorneys say he arrived in Afghanistan on September 6, 2001. At a news conference Wednesday in San Francisco, California, Lindh's parents called on President Bush to show mercy for their son.  Watch Lindh's parents ask for mercy on their son » . ""This is the Christmas season, and it's a time for mercy,"" said Lindh's mother, Marilyn Walker. His father, Frank Lindh, said his son, who grew up in California and converted to Islam as a teenager, ""is a Muslim. He will always, I think, be a Muslim."" His parents repeated their contention that Lindh went abroad to study Islam, found himself in Afghanistan in a civil war and joined the Taliban with no intent to support terrorism or fight against his homeland. They believe that the post-September 11 charges of terrorism, which were subsequently dismissed, spurred public reaction against Lindh that resulted in the 20-year sentence. ""Our son never fought against American forces,"" his mother said. ""He did not participate in terrorist activities of any kind. ... John made a mistake in joining the Afghan army at a time when their government was controlled by the Taliban. He has admitted that this was a mistake."" Lindh's attorneys said he is at a medium-security prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. The elder Lindh said his son has been treated ""very humanely"" in the federal prison system. ""Quietly and in a good way, he has served his seven years,"" Frank Lindh said. ""No matter what your perspective on this case, we think everyone should agree that seven years is enough."" Lindh's attorneys said that previous commutation appeals to the Bush administration have gone unanswered, but his father said Lindh's family holds out hope that Bush will act before leaving office. ""All of these events occurred while President Bush was in office,"" Frank Lindh said. ""This is on his plate. I'd like to think we'll get a response from President Bush this time."" Appearing before a U.S. district judge in 2002, Lindh said he ""made a mistake by joining the Taliban"" and ""had I realized then what I know now about the Taliban, I would never have joined them."" ""Life is making choices and living with the consequences,"" U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis told Lindh during the sentencing.

"(CNN) -- Using technology designed to protect U.S. troops, a Maryland company that makes bulletproof whiteboards has contracted with a university seeking to offer its professors greater protection in the event of a school shooting. The University of Maryland-Eastern Shore announced that it is purchasing 200 of the whiteboards from Hardwire LLC, a company based in Pocomoke City, Maryland, citing the need for a heightened sense of security in the wake of deadly mass shootings in recent years. Hardwire manufactures a variety of protective systems for police and military use, and also designs protective systems for infrastructure such as bridges. Between 2008 and 2011, it produced more than 5,000 armor kits for U.S. Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles, the company says on its website. More recently, the company has adapted technologies for school security, most notably the lightweight, 18-by-20-inch bulletproof whiteboards designed to protect the user's head and torso. The university's president, Juliette Bell, told CNN that the deadly school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut last December, in which a lone gunman killed 26 people, including 20 children, was a factor in the decision. Although UMES has not had a shooting incident, preventive campus security is a critical consideration, Bell said. ""It's the reality, as unfortunate as that is."" UMES has detailed response procedures for managing emergencies, but Bell said she and other school officials saw the whiteboards as a viable first line of defense. ""Anything that we can do that could potentially save a life, we are going to explore,"" she said. UMES Campus Police Chief Ernest Leatherbury noted the board, which weighs less than 4 pounds, is user-friendly. ""This is so accessible,"" he said, ""and it's not cumbersome."" UMES is the first U.S. institution of higher education to make such a significant investment in the whiteboards, committing nearly $60,000. They will be in classrooms when classes resume for the fall semester on August 26.","University of Maryland-Eastern Shore is buying 200 bulletproof whiteboards .

"(CNN) -- Booms, busts and bubbles are all jargon you might associate with today's troubled Irish economy. But now you can add ""beans"" to that list. The Jelly Bean Factory -- a father-and-son start-up -- is defying a difficult Irish economic climate with a turnover of 11 million euros ($14.6 million) a year. The sweet maker is refining the art of gourmet confectionery, teaming up with corporate giants including GlaxoSmithKline to produce specially designed jelly beans. Richard Cullen, managing director of The Jelly Bean Factory, told CNN: ""We make their energy sports beans under the brand Lucozade, we also partner with a Finnish company called Panda and we sell that into the Finnish market and also into the U.S. market."" The business, founded in 1998 by father Peter Cullen and son Richard, produces 12 million jelly beans a day and exports the sugary treats to more than 55 countries worldwide. The company expects growth to double over the next two years. Before the financial crisis of 2008, Ireland's economy was known as the ""Celtic Tiger"" due to its rapid economic expansion and property boom. Cullen said: ""Setting up manufacturing in Ireland at the height of the Celtic Tiger was a challenge in itself - just trying to find a property that we could afford was difficult, but then finding a workforce in those early stages was very difficult as well."" The Celtic Tiger stumbled after Ireland's banking crisis and the collapse of its construction sector. A member of the 17-nation single currency, Ireland is now undergoing a harsh austerity program and grappling with high unemployment. And as one of the three member states to receive financial aid from the eurozone's rescue funds, Ireland is also is also trying to repay a 67 billion euro ($89 billion) bailout to creditors. But despite the country's economic woes and the problems plaguing the eurozone, Cullen believes Ireland's place in the 27-nation European Union is ""definitely"" helping the business. Food regulation within the EU is tight but the Jelly Bean Factory is meticulous in its production. It takes two weeks to craft each of the individual 36 flavours, from Cranberry and apple to Belgian chocolate. Cullen told CNN: ""We transformed our business; we only use natural colours and natural flavours, so we don't have to put any health warnings on our products.""

"(CNN) -- A Cairo court Saturday adjourned the retrial of former President Hosni Mubarak over charges of involvement in the killing of protesters during the country's 2011 revolution. A judge postponed the retrial to August 25th. Mubarak faces charges connected to the killing of protesters during the revolution. He was forced from office in February 2011 following two weeks of mass street protests. His trial, which was adjourned last month, continued despite the latest upheaval in the country he ruled for 30 years. Protesters calling for a reinstatement of his successor as president, Mohamed Morsy, have battled with security forces for days, leaving hundreds dead. Following a lengthy trial, Mubarak and his former interior minister, Habib al-Adly, were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison last year on charges that they were complicit in the protesters' killings. After appealing their convictions, they were granted a new trial early this year. Six of Mubarak's former security aides last year were acquitted of charges related to the killings, and Mubarak's two sons -- Gamal and Alaa -- were acquitted of corruption charges. But they, too, were ordered to be retried after Morsy, himself ousted last month, ordered a new investigation last year. Mubarak and the other defendants have pleaded not guilty to all charges. The former president made his first court appearance in May. Mubarak has been held since his guilty verdict last year. After months spent in a military hospital, a public prosecutor sent him back to prison in April. Mubarak's health has been a bone of contention during his trial and incarceration. He suffered a heart attack after relinquishing power and had maintained that he was physically unfit to stand trial. He is also charged with seizing public funds and misusing political influence. In addition, he faces a corruption charge that was not part of the original trial. Mubarak is accused of selling natural gas to neighboring Israel for prices below fair market value. The ousted autocratic leader spent three decades in charge of Egypt, the most populous Arab country. Journalist Adam Makary contributed to this report.","The retrial of former President Hosni Mubarak was adjourned again last month .

"(CNN) -- It happens at the end of January every year -- an apparently mad and desperate dash to sign players as European football's transfer window draws to an agonizing close. Club officials man the phones, fax machines at the ready to sneak registrations inside the deadline. Football agents, desperate to secure their clients a lucrative last-minute move, frantically try to negotiate contracts and transfer fees before the clock strikes midnight and the chance has disappeared. It often seems like a classic case of panic-buying, as clubs seek to bolster their squads for the second half of the season, but the last-day scramble is the culmination of weeks of negotiations between all the involved parties, says British agent Mel Stein. ""Generally speaking, if somebody genuinely wants to buy a player, they will have earmarked him well before the window opens,"" says Stein, who represented former England stars such as Alan Shearer and Paul Gascoigne. Who are January's top transfer targets? ""You've got to have a player that wants to leave and wants to join the club who wants to buy him. So you've got to push all of those pieces together, which sometimes is a lot more difficult than it sounds."" Since 2002, European clubs have only been able to add to their rosters during two transfer windows -- which generally run in the offseason between July 1 and August 31 and midseason throughout the month of January. As a result, deadline day has become a biannual ritual, with fans glued to TV screens in the hope their club will pull off a shock transfer coup. Stein says the restrictions the windows have placed on clubs have added extra strain to transfer negotiations. ""There will have been some sort of contact, either formal or informal, well before the window opens,"" he explained. ""So if you date it from there to when the player actually signs, I'd say you're talking about an average of three or four weeks. ""I've got one or two deals that are bubbling under. People wait until the last minute and it's absolutely ridiculous. These deals could have happened weeks ago and yet managers are jockeying for position, they don't get the money from the club and then the club changes its mind at the last minute."" Stein says the 1992 transfer of Gascoigne, who was then 25 and in his prime, from London club Tottenham Hotspur to Rome-based Lazio was particularly difficult. ""The injuries, the financial problems Spurs were experiencing, the tax money element of it -- it was a very complicated transaction, it really was,"" he recalls. ""I lived and breathed it for months. I had an all-night session with Lazio, worked all the way through the night and didn't go to bed."" European football's governing body UEFA has attempted to cut reckless spending by introducing financial fair play regulations -- a set of rules which sanction clubs for spending beyond their means. Stein believes the eagerness of teams to lower their wage bills and conform to the new rules has changed how transfers are set in motion, with clubs now eager to offload high-earning stars. ""A couple of years ago, 95% of transfers would have been player instigated. Nowadays, with the financial restraints on clubs, I would say over 50% are club instigated,"" he says. ""I had a player who was astonished to learn that I'd been phoned by a manager who was telling me that my player was available because he was fairly high on that club's wage list and they wanted to reduce their budget."" This year's January window has been dominated by one player whose club want remove him from the wage bill, Manchester City's Carlos Tevez. The Argentina striker has been embroiled in a bitter dispute with the English leaders since being fined by the club for refusing to come on as a substitute during a European Champions League match with Bayern Munich in September. Tevez has been linked with Italian giants AC and Inter Milan and big-spending French outfit Paris Saint-Germain, but was looking likely to remain at City as the deadline approached. So what would be Stein's advice to the 27-year-old, who captained City to the club's first trophy in 35 years last season and topped the team's scoring charts -- but has not played for City since the incident in Germany? ""You've got Man City who want him out but don't want to lose a fortune. You've got Tevez jogging along a beach in South America and you've any number of people putting him around to clubs who probably can't afford him anyway,"" Stein says. ""That is a total nightmare transaction. I'm not saying it's one I wouldn't like to be involved in because it would be an enormous challenge to see that one through. ""I'd say, 'You're a professional footballer, you're only going to be playing until you're 35, you need to get yourself playing. This is stupid, you've got to do something.'

"(CNN) -- When Elon Musk released details of the Hyperloop -- a transportation system concept that could take people back and forth between San Francisco and Los Angeles at near sonic speeds in about 30 minutes -- he added, ""feedback would be most welcome."" Musk already has the input of 1000 engineers from SpaceX and Tesla. So why would he need additional pointers? Why did he invite the world to chime in? Historically, the planning and design of mass transit systems involved a team of experienced professionals working exclusively with those from other key stakeholder groups. The process may easily take up a decade before the final design is ready for approval. But just as today's open source product designs on the Web have benefited and improved from the collective effort of programmers, so has Musk decided to confront the design bottleneck by opening up the design process to the general public -- anyone and everyone who cares. The Hyperloop is a $6 billion public infrastructure project that is as challenging as it is ambitious. Opinion: Hyperloop could be a reality . The future of transportation may well lie in the hybridization of multiple technologies. The alpha version of the Hyperloop design published by Musk on Monday seems like a carefully engineered ""lego"" transit system with capsules supported on air bearings, the main tube placed on pylons and covered with solar arrays, and advanced propulsion systems. These components have been or can be individually designed, and made to work as per specification under normal conditions. The difficult part is to make the system safe and efficient while accounting for all the possible contingency events that may arise. The distance that separates any two adjacent capsules, called the headway, is a critical design parameter, and it will need to account for additional speed changes and halts that may occur during real operating conditions. Smaller headways will require a capsule-to-capsule signaling system. If multiple stations are envisioned, sophisticated interlocking systems must be designed. These signaling and control systems open up a Pandora's box of safety and security concerns. What if a computer hacker is able to bypass the signaling system? What if an attacker causes a severe collision by exploiting vulnerabilities of the electronics and communications equipment? The Hyperloop design will require built-in security and safety systems to address these scenarios. Needless to say, the possibilities for improvements are endless. We've just embarked on a path that can bring together the visionary transportation engineers, architects, urban planners and information technology experts who are willing to collaborate on the design process and flesh out its flaws to make the dream of building the world's fastest and safest transit system a reality. Already, the Hyperloop has provoked comparisons with the predominant modes of transport between the two megacities, San Francisco and Los Angeles. The SFO-LAX airline route is one of the busiest in the nation, serving around 2.8 million passengers per year. The flight time is about 80 minutes on good days. Airport security checks and loading/unloading times can easily double the actual travel time. We are looking at a door-to-door travel time of four to five hours after accounting for the time spent in navigating roads to the airport. This is not a significant improvement over a travel time of about five hours and 30 minutes for navigating the I-5 highway by car from San Francisco to Los Angeles. The proposed California High Speed Rail hopes to achieve a travel time of two hours and 40 minutes, but this estimate should be scaled up to include the time to reach the transit station from the main residential and business areas. For a fair comparison, Musk's travel time estimate of 30 minutes between San Francisco and Los Angeles must also be scaled up to include passenger loading/unloading times at the Hyperloop stations and the time to reach and navigate these stations. Still, if it is realized, it will be faster than plane, car, or high speed rail. At the very least, we can hope that the Hyperloop design can guide the enhancements to existing modes of transport. Wouldn't it be cool if in the next three years, the SFO airport has the capability to transfer passengers from BART to security check points located close to aircraft boarding zones using a super fast capsule-tube-propulsion system? Hyperloop, let's hope we can take a ride before the decade's end.

What sticks in the memory most was the build-up; this would begin several days prior to Eid -- mum would be busy preparing the sauces and marinades which were invariably rich, vibrant reds and greens. The aromas emanating from the kitchen were so intense that our mouths watered in anticipation as our bellies simultaneously whined ""are we there yet?"" CNN Celebrates: Weird and wonderful summer traditions . The day went something like this: We'd be up extremely early and the food fest would begin with Shir Khurma for breakfast. This is a lovely vermicelli and milk pudding, spiced with cardamom and cinnamon and served with an Indian rusk. Morning cravings sated, we'd then make our way to the Mosque for prayer until around 11am. As we were leaving the mosque, I remember feeling excited at the prospect of going home for a huge selection of tasty deep-fried goodies, which usually consisted of samosas (lamb and potato and chicken and pea), pakoras and lentil and ginger cakes, all served with relishes and tomato ketchup. At this point, people would be gathered at the house and we'd make visits to friends' and relatives' houses, where we'd be treated to sweet tea and samosas. Around 1pm we'd get back to a house full of people and start tucking into a delicious lunch of mutton yakhni pulao, a classic rice dish from Lucknow; this would be accompanied by lamb and chicken kormas -- very lightly spiced with aromatic milk sauces. There'd always be a boiled egg added too. In addition, there would be spiced roast chicken and spicy kebabs. Dessert always tended to be coconut samosas and sweet semolina. Eid is a particularly ostentatious event and, I can remember mum putting silver leaf on the rice and puddings as decoration. CNN Celebrates: The world's best fireworks displays . I would have to say that Biryanis/pulaos, samosas, kebabs and Indian sweets and puddings best showcase the culinary traditions around Eid. If I were cooking to impress I would stick to these traditional, simple dishes. I say simple, but aesthetics aside, they're anything but; this food's actually very intricate as the flavors have to be subtle, which is quite difficult to pull off, especially in the case of a pulao. In my opinion, if you can make a perfect pulao the culinary aspect of Eid will be a joyous time and a huge success, as all the other dishes are complementary to it.","British chef Aktar Islam shares his best Eid food memories .

"Washington (CNN) -- It feels like a generation gap in the GOP. Party elders appear increasingly concerned -- alarmed, even -- by an upstart effort by a new band of conservative lawmakers who want to shut down the federal government to protest the president's signature health care law, Obamacare. The plan -- really more of a bargaining strategy -- was hatched primarily by lawmakers elected in the past few years -- exposing a rift in the GOP about how best to deal with the controversial health care law a year before the 2014 elections. Supporters of a government shutdown are nowhere near critical mass even as 13 lawmakers recently signed a letter pledging opposition to any spending bill that doesn't defund the health law. To be successful, supporters of a government shutdown would need almost every Republican in the Senate to join their effort. Washington braces for post-recess shutdown battle . The GOP establishment is undoubtedly against a shutdown and many of them are becoming more vocal about it. ""The people of the nation would not be happy,"" said 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney this week at a New Hampshire fundraiser about the possibility of a shutdown where Medicare benefits were skipped and troops didn't get paid. Romney: Pick someone who can win in 2016 . ""Most Americans are really tired of those kinds of shenanigans here in Washington,"" Arizona Sen. John McCain said on the conservative Michael Medved radio show last month. A prominent conservative opinion maker, columnist Charles Krauthammer, called the idea ""nuts."" Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn, who in the past has showed himself more than willing to step on the cogs of government if he disagrees with something, told the Washington Examiner a shutdown could cost Republicans control of the House. His Oklahoma colleague, Rep. Tom Cole, said on Fox News that shutting down the government would be like a legislative ""temper tantrum."" But there is evidence that many in the outspoken party base would seriously disagree. Tea party activists posted a video critical of freshman North Carolina Rep. Rob Pittenger, who drew jeers when he said during a town hall event in his district this week, ""No,"" the party shouldn't shut the government down. Obamacare battle moves to states . In an interview with CNN's Jim Acosta on Wednesday, Pittenger defended his decision to stand against tea party activists who called for a shutdown to defund Obamacare. But Pittenger appears to be an exception as a younger lawmaker standing against shutdown proponents. ""The reality is, if we're willing to take a government shutdown unless we repeal Obamacare, ... we will lose that vote and Obamacare will survive it,"" Pittenger said. ""Why would we go about a strategy that is doomed to failure."" Seeking to find middle ground in the party, a separate group of conservatives, including anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, have suggested instead to use the threat of shutdown to force a one year delay in implementing the law in place of pursuing a full repeal. Ending Obamacare, avoiding shutdown juggling act for Boehner . Backlash against Obamacare helped propel Republicans to take back control of the House in 2010. But exhaustive efforts since to repeal it have been ineffective. Utah Sen. Mike Lee, the leader of the shutdown effort, was elected in 2010 after defeating longtime Republican Sen. Bob Bennett in the primary. While his proposal to shut down the government is not embraced by establishment Republicans, it has drawn praise from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, two conservative stars who are believed to be considering runs for president in 2016. Both also, like Lee, defeated more establishment GOP candidates on their way to Washington in 2010. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who hasn't taken a definitive position on the shutdown plan, is now facing a primary challenge in his bid for reelection in Kentucky. Add to all of this the default, shutdown, economic calamity show that has been a Washington rerun due to a string of battles over the federal borrowing limit and government spending. These conservative newcomers to Washington have seen the White House make dire warnings about how the recent forced spending cuts -- known formally as sequestration -- would have a negative effect on the government and military. But months later, the forced spending cuts have been largely swept out of the news and the federal government -- from the Pentagon to the Health and Human Services Department -- has shown an ability to absorb it for now. Cruz recently argued in a speech at the Heritage Foundation that shutting down the government wouldn't be that bad and could help the GOP. ""There are some Democrats, some in the media and some Republicans who portray a shutdown as a horrible calamity,"" Cruz said. ""I think the term 'shutdown' is a misnomer. It's actually a partial, temporary shutdown. We have seen them before."" Cruz argued that Saturday and Sunday are kind of like government shutdowns. Read Washington Post review of Cruz's claim . But it is Romney, who has acknowledged that he's probably the last person Republicans are now looking to for advice, who gave the most earnest argument on Tuesday against shutting down the government. ""I badly want Obamacare to go away, and stripping it of funds has appeal. But we need to exercise great care about any talk of shutting down government,"" said Romney, according to a prepared text of his remarks at the private fundraiser. ""What would come next ... what would come next when soldiers aren't paid, when seniors fear for their Medicare and Social Security, and when the FBI is off duty? I'm afraid that in the final analysis, Obamacare would get its funding, our party would suffer in the next elections, and the people of the nation would not be happy."" A spokesman for Cruz, responded to Romney on Wednesday, arguing that Americans see Obamacare as ""train wreck."" ""They expect their elected representatives to fight to undo it,"" said Cruz spokesman Sean Ruston. ""If Republicans stand up for principle, we can win this debate.""","Republican Party elders concerned with upstarts' efforts to shut down government .

"(CNN) -- A man known for impersonating a Rockefeller was sentenced Thursday to 27 years to life in the death of his Southern California landlady's son, who disappeared in 1985. A jury in April convicted German-born Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter of first-degree murder in the killing of John Sohus, 27. Sohus' dismembered remains were found in 1994 by workers installing a pool at a home his mother once owned in San Marino. At the time of Sohus' disappearance, Gerhartsreiter had been renting a guesthouse from Sohus' mother, authorities said. The bespectacled and handcuffed Gerhartsreiter, clad in a blue jail jumpsuit, on Thursday filed a lengthy motion for a new trial. ""I would like to once again to reassert my innocence, that I would like to definitively state that I did not commit the crime of which I stand convicted,"" he said. When Los Angeles Superior Court Judge George G. Lomeli said evidence and testimony provided no basis for a new trial, the convicted man than withdrew the motion because he could not read it aloud in court. He still can file an appeal of his conviction and sentence. The jury found that Gerhartsreiter used a sharp instrument and blunt object to commit the crime. The whereabouts of the dead man's wife, Linda Sohus, are unknown. At his sentencing, Gerhartsreiter said she was responsible for the killing. Before the sentence was imposed, John Sohus' sister, Ellen, told the court there was no closure for the family. ""Why did you kill my brother?"" she said to Gerhartsreiter. ""What happened to Linda? I believe Linda is dead, and I believe you are responsible for her death."" Sohus' father, who died in 2002, said there should be no memorial service until the killer was brought to justice. ""This destroyed him,"" said Ellen Sohus. ""He told me that he thought of John everyday. He would periodically call me deep in his grief and say, 'Why John?' "" Gerhartsreiter, 52, had led a life of multiple identities, at one point assuming the identity of ""Clark Rockefeller,"" a cultured poseur who never seemed to have a job. A Boston tabloid dubbed him ""Crockefeller."" A 2010 made-for-TV movie, ""Who Is Clark Rockefeller?"" starring Eric McCormack as Gerhartsreiter, aired on the Lifetime network. He was serving a prison sentence in Massachusetts for kidnapping his daughter, then 7, from his ex-wife in 2008 when he was transferred to California for the murder trial. Gerhartsreiter came to the United States from Germany in 1978, according to testimony at his trial for kidnapping. After spending a few years in Connecticut, he moved to Wisconsin, where he married in a green card arrangement using his true name. Gerhartsreiter then relocated to California. He settled in San Marino, a wealthy community near Pasadena, where he lived under the name Christopher Chichester from 1983 to 1985. He posed as a film student and boasted that he was of English royalty, according to Vanity Fair magazine, which profiled him in January 2009 and quoted several people who knew ""Chichester"" at the time. As Chichester, he rented a guest house from Ruth ""Didi"" Sohus. John and Linda came to live with Didi Sohus during the time Gerhartsreiter lived in the guest quarters. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter is sentenced in death of landlady's son .

"(CNN) -- In a year marred with controversy and national notoriety, Penn State University alumni and boosters finally have something to smile about. In fiscal year 2011-2012, the school earned $208.7 million in donations -- the second-highest annual amount in school history -- according to a release from the Development and Alumni Relations division. Penn State spokesman David LeTorre said the donations ""send a loud and distinct message,"" in what has been a particularly challenging time for the school. ""Despite the things that have happened with Jerry Sandusky, Penn State never really lost the support of its alumni,"" La Torre said. Muralist replaces Sandusky image . The school was thrust into the national spotlight with accusations against former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted last month on 45 of 48 counts related to sexual abuse of boys. The scandal's fallout included the firings of legendary football coach Joe Paterno and university President Graham Spanier. ""So many alumni were ready to contribute this year,"" La Torre said, ""which is proof enough our family our alumni family is there when we need them."" A total of 191,712 supporters donated 323,271 gifts that have put the school ahead of schedule to reach its $2 billion fundraising goal by June 2014 for its ""For the Future: The Campaign for Penn State Students"" campaign. Since the effort began in January of 2007, $1.6 billion has been raised. ""Fundraising is always challenging,"" La Torre said. But, he said, those seeking donations didn't go about it any differently even in light of the highly publicized scandal and an economic downturn. Painful chapter closes with Sandusky conviction . ""We knew people were going to ask questions and want answers,"" he said. ""The philosophy of Penn State has been to listen and give answers to the best of our ability.""

"London (CNN) -- Close observers of Qatar will know that Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, whose succession to the Gulf state's leadership was announced by his father on Tuesday morning, has played an increasingly central role in shaping the country's direction in recent years. As heir apparent, Tamim has led on the implementation of Vision 2030, Qatar's ambitious national strategy which sets out to promote ""justice, benevolence and equality."" He is also the author of the country's current five-year plan, in which he calls for ""continuous modernization and development of public institutions."" The key question now is whether these finely crafted state strategy documents Tamim has authored as heir apparent can translate into real human rights change in Qatar's institutions, as the rubber hits the road and he takes control of government. The current five-year strategy, for example, promises that there will be much-needed laws to criminalise domestic violence and to give labour rights to migrant domestic workers, something for which campaigners have been calling for years. The strategy leaves no room for disagreement when it says that ""since 2004 Qatar has seen a significant jump in the number of reported domestic violence incidents against women and children."" But when Amnesty International met government officials in Doha earlier this year, they played down incidents of domestic violence as merely ""individual cases"". And a senior Labour Ministry official recently told a Qatari newspaper that ""there is no need for a law for housemaids... Since there is a contract signed between a maid and her employer, a law isn't needed."" Vision 2030 also says it embodies the principles of the country's constitution which ""protects public and personal freedoms"". And yet there was widespread shock last November, when a court in Doha sentenced a Qatari poet, Mohammed al-Ajami, to life imprisonment on charges of incitement ""to overthrow the ruling system"", and ""insulting the Amir."" The charges relate to a 2010 poem criticizing the ruling family, but activists believed that the real reason for his arrest was his 2011 ""Jasmine Poem"" which read: ""we are all Tunisia in the face of the repressive elite."" All the information available points to al-Ajami being placed behind bars solely for his words. At the time one regional activist told Amnesty that ""we expected better,"" referring to Qatar's efforts to paint itself as a country promoting freedom of expression, as host to both the Al Jazeera network and the Doha Center for Media Freedom. Disturbingly, almost at the same time, the authorities moved to tighten control on freedom of expression with a new draft media law, which, if approved, would require all publications to be approved by a government-appointed ""competent authority"" empowered to remove content or prevent printing. Al-Ajami's sentence was reduced to 15 years in February, which has done little to quell the outrage. The treatment of his case will be an early signal of whether Qatar's new ruler intends to allow greater freedoms of expression at home. Tamim has also chaired the committee organizing the Qatar 2022 World Cup, the country's most ambitious global initiative yet. It is a sensitive project and one that will test the new ruler's commitment to real reform. Since Qatar won the right to host the tournament, the country has come under intense scrutiny for its treatment of migrant construction workers, who come primarily from South Asia. There are fears that the hundreds of thousands of new workers who will be needed to build the stadiums and infrastructure for the World Cup could face exploitation or even forced labor. Amnesty International has been interviewing migrant laborers and construction companies in Qatar over the past nine months, and has found that the abuse of migrant laborers runs deep, with some workers on major national projects going for months without being paid, being prevented from leaving the country by their employers and even struggling to afford food. The challenge for the World Cup Committee is how to ensure that the companies they employ to build their projects comply with international labor standards. Of course, it cannot be only about the organizing committee. The role of the government to prevent entrenched exploitation will be critical. Tamim's five-year plan recognizes -- with slightly surprising candor -- that ""improving labor rights will not only benefit employees but will also enhance Qatar's global image as a leading and progressive nation."" But Qatar's new ruler will need to be aware that the opposite will also be true. Unless his government is able to energetically enforce labor protections and make major reforms to the repressive Sponsorship Law which gives employers excessive powers over their workers, Qatar's global image will inevitably suffer, just as the migrant workers Amnesty International has met are suffering right now. Sheikh Tamim and his ministers will need to show political will if they want to deliver the freedom and justice called for in the state strategy set under his stewardship. Activists, across the region and globally, will be watching carefully for early signs of that will. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Lynch.","Qatar's emir hands over power to son, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani .

"(CNN) -- The Nigerian military said Thursday it killed one of the leaders of the Islamist extremist group, Boko Haram, which has waged an insurgency in the nation for years. Mamadu Bama was the second-in-command, the military said in a statement. He was killed this month along with his father, who was the group's spiritual mentor, the military said. The militant group has not released any statement on the deaths. Boko Haram has attacked various targets in the nation since 2009, murdering and kidnapping Westerners, and bombing schools and churches. It is suspected to be behind a gruesome mosque killing this week. In that attack Sunday, militants brandishing automatic weapons killed 44 worshipers in the country's troubled Borno state. Around the time of the attack, the group released a video boasting that it was growing stronger. Boko Haram translates loosely to ""western education is forbidden/sinful."" It holds all government authority in contempt and wants to establish a state in northern Nigeria under Islamic law. Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of extrajudicial killings in its fight against the militant group. ""Soldiers have allegedly burned homes and executed Boko Haram suspects or residents with no apparent links to the group,"" Human Rights Watch said in a report this year. ""Nigerian authorities have rarely brought anyone to justice for these crimes.""","Boko Haram has attacked various targets in the nation since 2009 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Virginia GOP Rep. Randy Forbes on Wednesday became the first member of Congress to call for U.S. Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan to step down due to a prostitution scandal involving eleven agents that has raised questions about security at the agency. ""There are only so many strikes you get -- in baseball it's three,"" Forbes told CNN. ""I think (Sullivan's) had three. I think it's time to put somebody else in there to make sure we're getting a different culture in the Secret Service."" Forbes, a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, cited an earlier security breach at a White House state dinner involving the Salahis, a couple who got through security without an invitation. He also noted the agency's recent inability to remain within its budget. There needs to be ""change at the top,"" Forbes stressed. But House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon, R-California, disagreed with Forbes, telling reporters he didn't think the head of the agency should be held responsible. ""I think that's a reach ... to go after the head of an organization because a few guys mess up,"" McKeon said Wednesday. Forbes said the security issues were serious, and Congress needed to be more involved in finding out what happened in Colombia. ""We aren't just talking about one prostitute. We are talking about a bus load of prostitutes that they're bringing in,"" Forbes said. Eleven Secret Service agents are allegedly involved in the scandal, along with several members of the U.S. military. The agents were in Colombia in advance of a visit by President Barack Obama. The alleged prostitutes, the youngest of whom were in their early 20s, had all signed in at Cartagena's Hotel El Caribe, flashing their local IDs. One of the women, a source said, became involved in a dispute with Secret Service personnel about how much she was to be paid. That dispute brought the incident to light. ""This is kind of security planning 101,"" Forbes said. ""It is the basic core fundamental, and the big concern I have is that it isn't just Americans looking into this. It is the rest of the world, and so I think it is time we jump on this and do something about it."" The Virginia Republican said he is confident the Pentagon is capable of handling its component of the investigation -- as many as ten members of the military have been implicated in the scandal. But Forbes doesn't have the same level of trust in agencies outside the military, and said he planned to urge the head of the House Judiciary Committee to hold hearings into the matter. The Senate Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, has announced it will hold a hearing on the matter next Wednesday. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has been invited to testify. The Secret Service is part of the Homeland Security Department. Like Forbes, McKeon believes that the Pentagon is ""very capable"" of doing its own probe of members of the military who may be involved. He doesn't see a role for Congress in the matter. ""I don't think Congress needs to jump in to start trying to fix something that we don't even know what the problem is yet,"" McKeon said. But McKeon said he would likely raise the issue with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta when he meets with Panetta before the secretary's scheduled appearance before the House Armed Services Committee on Thursday.","Virginia Rep.

"(CNN) -- Iran's Red Crescent Society will try to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza by sending food and medical supplies to the besieged Palestinian territory, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman said Monday. Red Crescent official Abdul Rauf Adibzadeh said one shipment of relief goods will arrive in Gaza via Egypt by the end of the week, Iranian media reported. The aid group is also preparing to send two relief ships to the coast of Gaza, including a hospital ship with doctors, nurses and operating rooms and another vessel with more relief goods like food and medication, the IRNA and Mehr news agencies reported. Israel stopped a convoy of six ships trying to deliver aid to Gaza last week in defiance of an Israeli blockade, killing at least nine people in the course of boarding one of the vessels. Adibzadeh said there is a possibility that Iranian Red Crescent ships may be attacked but added that, despite the danger, if the Iranian authorities approve, the shipments will be sent to Gaza. Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said the Iranian ships will be part of a new aid flotilla organized by several Islamic countries, though he declined to say which countries are involved. He called it ""strictly a humanitarian effort for the people of Gaza."" ""We are preparing two ships to head for Gaza that will provide humanitarian aid,"" Mehmanparast said. ""Their departure depends on how soon we coordinate with other countries that are also sending aid ships. The process of organizing the operation is under way."" Separately, a ""Jewish boat"" is planning to try to reach Gaza, two pro-Palestinian European Jewish groups announced Monday. ""Our purpose is to call an end to the siege of Gaza, to this illegal collective punishment of the whole civilian population,"" Edith Lutz said on behalf of European Jews for a Just Peace in the Near East and Jews for Justice for Palestinians. The group is not saying when the boat is sailing or where it is leaving from ""in order to avoid sabotage,"" Lutz said. Israeli commandos intercepted the first convoy at sea May 31 and stormed the largest vessel, the Turkish-flagged Mavi Marmara. The ships were carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza, organizers said. The Palestinian territory has been blockaded by Israel since its takeover by the Islamic movement Hamas in 2007. The deadly raid sparked international condemnation. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden avoided mentioning the issue directly when he spoke after meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt on Monday. He said that the present situation ""is unsustainable for all sides"" and that the Israelis and Palestinians needed to ""move to direct negotiations as soon as possible that will result in an end to the occupation that began in 1967 and to a two-state solution to the conflict with Israel and a Palestinian state living in peace and security."" The U.N. Security Council has called for an inquiry into the flotilla raid, and the U.N. Human Rights Council has condemned the assault and voted to launch an investigation. Israeli officials have defended the legality of the raid, criticizing those aboard the Mavi Marmara for attacking the boarding party and insisting that they can handle the investigation themselves.

"(CNN) -- A stuffy, overcrowded cell. At times, two or three men to a single bunk. Lockdown for 23 out of 24 hours. Is this what awaits South Africa's Oscar Pistorius if he is not released on bail while he awaits trial for the murder of his girlfriend? Some of South Africa's prisons are better than others. But whichever one might house Pistorius, there's no question that conditions would be a far cry from those in his $560,000 home in the luxury Silverwoods Estate, on the outskirts of Pretoria. South African prisons are frequently overcrowded, putting a strain on sanitation, ventilation and medical care, according to Nooshin Erfani-Ghadimi, project coordinator for the Johannesburg-based Wits Justice Project , a civil society group. The overcrowding means three men may share a single cell, or communal cells for 40 people are jammed with double the number they were intended to hold, with men sleeping in double or triple bunks, she said. ""We heard of one person who for the first year in remand detention slept on the floor and then 'graduated' to a bunk,"" she said. Remand is the term used for pretrial custody. Many inmates are kept locked up for 23 hours a day, with only an hour outside their cell. Some prisons go into lockdown as early as 3 or 4 p.m., leaving prisoners cooped up for 12 hours or more at a stretch. ""It's not a pretty picture,"" Erfani-Ghadimi said. Overcrowding is a particular problem in remand prisons, where it runs at just over 200%, she said, citing figures from the Department of Correctional Services. Overall, overcrowding in prisons stands at about 133%. And Pretoria Central Prison, perhaps the most likely destination for Pistorius if he doesn't get bail, ""doesn't have a very good reputation,"" Erfani-Ghadimi said. Special treatment? The track star's high-profile case is likely to thrust South Africa's criminal justice system under the spotlight. Questions have already been asked about why Pistorius, a gold medal-winning Paralympian, is being detained in a holding cell at the Brooklyn Police Station -- and not at Central Prison or Newlock, where other defendants awaiting trial are kept. ""If there is some special circumstance that permits this, authorities must share this with the public as they are setting a bad precedent,"" the women's branch of South Africa's ruling party said in a prepared statement. ""All should be treated equally before the law no matter your standing in society."" Pistorius is getting special treatment, the African National Congress Women's League said, adding that his family can visit him outside visiting hours -- unlike relatives of other inmates. ""If Pistorius is denied bail, he must be moved to a proper prison facility with others accused of similar crimes,"" the statement said. ""A strong message must be sent out that wealth and celebrity cannot give you an advantage over the law."" The 26-year-old has rejected the murder allegation ""in the strongest terms,"" his agent said in a statement. Pistorius' lawyers requested Brooklyn last week so that they could have access to their client over the weekend, following his arrest Thursday. The state did not object. The case of Shrien Dewani, a British man accused of hiring hitmen to kill his wife on their South African honeymoon, cast the country's criminal justice system in an unflattering light. His lawyers argued last year that his extradition would breach his human rights under European law because he risked being attacked by other inmates in South African prisons. While British High Court judges dismissed that part of Dewani's argument, concerns about potential torture and abuse in detention are warranted, Erfani-Ghadimi said. South Africa is a signatory to the U.N. Convention on Torture, but it has yet to ratify it, so such abuses have not been criminalized. ""A legacy of apartheid is that prison cells are still unfortunately a place where prisoners can be abused,"" Erfani-Ghadimi said. Amnesty International's Annual Report 2012, which looked at human rights around the world, also said that a draft law to make torture a criminal offense had not been presented in South Africa's parliament by the end of the year. Human dignity . Nevertheless, said Erfani-Ghadimi, the problem doesn't lie in South Africa's laws so much as in the ability of the justice system to cope with the number of inmates in the system. South Africa's constitution and its bill of rights, with regard to prisoners' rights, are among the best in the world, she said. ""Unfortunately, that doesn't necessarily translate into practice."" She says she thinks conditions are improving, however, thanks in part to the strength of those constitutional rights and the work of civil society organizations campaigning for change. And Pistorius, if he ends up spending time on remand or is eventually convicted and jailed, should find that his particular medical needs as a double amputee are taken into account, she said. This could mean that he is sent to a prison with better medical facilities or wheelchair access, she suggested. According to the bill of rights, prisoners are entitled to ""be detained in conditions that are consistent with human dignity, including at least exercise and the provision, at state expense, of adequate accommodation, nutrition, medical treatment."" Correctional Services Department spokesman Koos Gerber said South Africa's detention facilities, whether for remand prisoners or those serving prison terms, ""can accommodate people with any disabilities."" ""We have a general problem of overcrowding but we have learned to live with it,"" said Gerber, adding that extra bunks have been added to make sure all remand prisoners have a bed. Hospital facilities are also available at all times, he said. According to official figures for 2011 to 2012, there were 158,790 prison inmates in South Africa, a nation of nearly 52 million, of whom about 30% were on remand awaiting trial. This compares with about 2.2 million people in prisons or jails in the United States at the end of 2011, according to U.S. Department of Justice figures. Crowding in U.S. prisons stood at 39% over capacity in 2011, according to a Government Accountability Office report. Long wait for trial . Erfani-Ghadimi blames systemic problems for South Africa's overcrowding. One issue is that police are quick to arrest people, she said, and they have only 48 hours from arrest to bring charges. After they are charged, many suspects cannot afford to make bail or hire a lawyer and so are forced to spend months or even years behind bars awaiting trial, she said. Investigations are often poorly run and courtrooms can be overcrowded, adding to the hurdles faced by those on remand, she said. ""Because the system is cumbersome and slow, there's a lot of people stuck waiting -- and that means the conditions are not by any means ideal,"" she added. A ""statement of agreed factual findings"" filed in a Constitutional Court ruling in December, in favor of a man who contracted tuberculosis while imprisoned, gives insight into what could lie ahead for Pistorius. The statement describes the conditions Dudley Lee endured in Cape Town's Pollsmoor Maximum Security Prison -- where Nelson Mandela was once held -- before he was eventually acquitted and freed. Prisoners going to court appearances were ""stuffed into vans like sardines,"" it said. Holding cells at court were also ""jam-packed."" Meanwhile, conditions back at the prison were far from pleasant -- though ideal for the spread of disease. Packed, smoky cells . The air inside the communal cells, locked down without cross-ventilation for up to 15 hours a day, was thick with cigarette smoke, the statement said. Even after Lee was diagnosed with TB, he was kept in a cell with other prisoners. He ""begged, bullied and bribed"" to get the medication he needed. As a world-famous athlete, Pistorius has money to pay for good defense attorneys, unlike many in the South African justice system. He stated his annual income was 5.6 million rand ($631,000) at his bail hearing this week. Nonetheless, his lawyers face an uphill battle on the bail issue, with South African law requiring evidence of ""exceptional circumstances"" to justify the release of defendants accused of premeditated murder. If they fail, Pistorius could face several months on remand before his case goes to trial. And if convicted of premeditated murder, he would face 25 years in prison before being eligible for parole. His lawyers will be trying to make sure that doesn't happen.","South Africa's prisons are generally overcrowded, says the Wits Justice Project .

"State College, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- This wasn't how Penn State football coach Bill O'Brien hoped things would start. He rushed off the field in disappointment after his Nittany Lions lost 24-14 to Ohio University. But judging by the scene around him, you wouldn't have known it. As the two teams knelt in prayer at the end of the game, many of the more than 97,000 faithful fans in attendance proudly sang the school's alma mater. Forging a new meaning for the rally cry 'We Are... Penn State' In the student section at one end zone, students, many of whom had camped out for first-row seats since Wednesday night, stood shoulder to shoulder with their arms around each other as they belted out the words. ""For the glory of old State, for her founders strong and great, for the future that we wait, raise the song, raise the song."" One woman wiped tears from her eyes, smearing the blue paint that covered her face. ""I'm not crying because we lost,"" freshman Kelly Jordan said. ""I mean, I was really hoping we could show everyone that they were wrong about us. But how can you not be proud of what happened here today? This is who we are -- united. I'm proud of what those guys did on the field. They had a tall mountain to climb, but just couldn't get all the way there."" Penn State scandal: Where things stand . The team had the full support of alumni from near and far and the boisterous cheers from the student section. They led into the third quarter and gassed out, losing 24-14. It was a disappointing outcome for the team, though there were many things stacked against them from the start. In the wake of the child sex abuse scandal that rocked campus and saw former coach Jerry Sandusky convicted of abusing 10 boys over 15 years, the football program was rocked. NCAA sanctions that included a post-season ban led to many of their key starters transferring. Legendary coach Joe Paterno was fired, and the team had to rebuild from scratch. When the hero falls off the pedestal . And in the third quarter it showed. Costly errors, missed tackles and fumbled passes got the best of them. But O'Brien put the blame entirely on himself, falling on the sword in a press conference after the game. ""I think we all gotta coach better and that starts with me,"" he told a packed room of reporters. ""I gotta coach a lot better."" While he may be right and there are still kinks to work out, the scoreboard at the end of the game told only part of the story. Complete coverage of Penn State . Fans had turned out in the thousands more than four hours before kickoff to show the new coach they supported him. ""It means more than anything. It means so much to be a part of this rebuilding process,"" freshman Avi Kallmeyer said as he prepared to take his seat in the first row of the student section. ""We're still here, and we're not going anywhere."" Many held up signs proclaiming 'We Stand With You"" as blue buses pulled up with the players and coaches. It's a longtime tradition at Penn State. The crowds roared for nearly five minutes, long after the players had already entered the tunnel into the stadium. The game was the culmination of a long week of pep rallies of sorts -- both official and unofficial. On Friday night the school held its Football Eve pep rally to get students and alums pumped about the new season. After nine months of clouds hanging over them they were ready to get the season -- and in many ways the healing -- started. They were thankful. They were excited. They knew that together they have something to prove to the world. And they were ready to take the first major step toward writing a new chapter for the storied football team. The same could be said about the crowd Saturday afternoon, even after losing to a team in a mid-major conference for the first time in a home opener since the 1960s. While there were looks of disappointment, the overall enthusiasm did not waver even ask the clock ticked down with Ohio in the lead. Chants of ""We Are Penn State!"" and ""Bill O'Brien!"" rocked the stadium. Penn State's student section, known for being one of the most passionate in the nation, stood the entire game cheering the team on until the very last moment. That passion, and more importantly, the support was not lost on O'Brien. And although he appeared stoic during the press conference, he made sure to acknowledge how much it meant to him. ""I thought it was a great atmosphere,"" he said. ""I think it was a good crowd and just want them to keep coming and support the football team. And we really appreciate the support of the fans."" As they exited the stadium, many of them said it was a good game and a good start for the team and pledged to be there for them as they seek to get stronger, become more cohesive and move toward even more important games. Shortly before the game Susan Lamey stood outside the stadium in glasses with the paws of the Nittany Lion on her face. She's put them on for 18 seasons' worth of home games, most of them victories that were vacated as part of NCAA sanctions against the school. None of that -- and nothing that follows -- will change that, she says. ""We've been here for 50 years and it's been a lot of changes, and we have been hurt by many, many things. But no matter what, we will always be here for this football team. And we will be here for Bill O'Brien -- win, lose or draw. We're here for the long haul."" That's exactly the kind of support O'Brien hopes he can count on and may need as the team looks forward to a tougher schedule. And while there's many uncertainties that lie ahead for him and the team, the fans in Happy Valley seem determined to help deliver all the support they can give.","Penn State loses season opener to Ohio University .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama announced Thursday that the United States has canceled joint military training exercises with the Egyptian military and alluded to the fact that his administration could take further steps to deal with the violence in Egypt. ""Going forward, I've asked my national security team to assess the implications of the actions taken by the interim government and further steps we may take as necessary with respect to the U.S.-Egyptian relationship,"" Obama said. In a statement from his vacation home on Martha's Vineyard, the president, however, refrained from calling the government overthrow a coup, which would have implications for the military and humanitarian aid the United States sends to Egypt. ""The United States strongly condemns the steps that have been taken by Egypt interim government and security forces,"" Obama said about this week's Egyptian military crackdown against protests in Cairo. ""We deplore violence against civilians."" Obama avoided taking sides with any factions in the country, which his administration has done consistently. ""We don't take sides with any particular party or political figure,"" Obama said. ""We want Egypt to succeed. We want a peaceful, democratic, prosperous Egypt. That's our interest."" The president continued: ""America cannot determine the future of Egypt. That's a task for the Egyptian people."" Obama put the United States on the side of the Egyptian people, stating that his administration believes regular Egyptians ""deserve better than what we have seen in the last several days."" ""To the Egyptian people, let me say the cycle of violence and escalation needs to stop,"" Obama said. ""We call on the Egyptian authorities to respect the universal rights of the people."" Bergen: Al Qaeda leader's 'I told you so' on Egypt . Bright Star -- next month's joint U.S.-Egyptian military exercise -- would have involved thousands of American air and ground forces. Obama administration officials told CNN on Wednesday that canceling the military exercises -- which are held every two years -- was being considered. The president is currently on vacation with his family on Martha's Vineyard, an island off the coast of Massachusetts. Some Republicans and right-leaning blogs have criticized that fact that while Egypt fell into turmoil, the president golfed, went to a cocktail party and ate at an upscale restaurant. A senior White House official told CNN's Jake Tapper Thursday the president was briefed on the severity of the violence in Egypt in a phone call with key administration officials involved in U.S.-Egypt relations, including Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, Secretary of State John Kerry and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Obama's statement comes a day after the bloodiest day in Egypt since the 2011 revolution that ousted Hosni Mubarak. At least 525 people were killed and more than 3,700 injured, according to the Egyptian Health Ministry, in clashes that began when security forces moved in to break up protesters demonstrating in support of former President Mohamed Morsy, who was elected to office after Mubarak's ouster. The number of dead could go up, as the Muslim Brotherhood has said many of its supporters who were killed have not yet been counted. Egypt's Christians under pressure as churches are torched . The violent outbreaks mark the bloodiest moment in Egypt's short-lived experiment with democracy. In July, Egypt's military toppled Morsy, the country's first democratically elected president, and remanded him to jail. The Obama administration at the time did not call the overthrow a coup. That decision was roundly criticized by Republicans like Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who traveled to Egypt earlier this month and said Morsy's ouster was clearly a coup. The terminology could affect the more than $1 billion in foreign aid Egypt gets from the United States. U.S. law restricts providing aid in instances of a military coup, and though White House spokesman Jay Carney has said the Obama administration is evaluating the ""incredibly complex and difficult situation,"" he also said Washington is not ready to cut off the aid. ""It would not be in the best interests of the United States to immediately change our assistance programs"" to Egypt, Carney said in July. When reporters pressed Carney on the coup question, the spokesman stubbornly repeated a lengthy response that essentially said the United States would determine how to proceed at its own pace. ""What we don't believe is necessary is to hastily reach a determination when the right course of action in our view is to review this in a deliberate manner, to consult with Congress, to review our obligations under the law and to, in the meantime, encourage the authorities in Egypt to hasten a return to democratic governance in that country, and to a democratically elected government,"" he said. The Obama administration, when pressed on this issue, has stressed the complexity of the situation in Egypt -- the most populous Arab country in the world and one of only two Arab nations to have signed a peace treaty with vital U.S. ally Israel. Obama condemns Egyptian military crackdown on civilians . Obama's Thursday statement echoed much of what Kerry said on Wednesday -- that the violence was a ""serious blow"" to reconciliation efforts in the African nation. ""The United States strongly condemns today's violence and bloodshed across Egypt -- it's a serious blow to reconciliation and the Egyptian people's hopes for a transition towards democracy and inclusion,"" Kerry said from the State Department press briefing room.

"(CNN) -- The company building the controversial Keystone XL pipeline has submitted a proposal for a new route, a spokesman for Nebraska's environmental authority said Wednesday. The new route is east of the initially proposed route that went over an environmentally sensitive aquifer, said spokesman Brian McManus of the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality. TransCanada is the company constructing Keystone. The pipeline is intended to carry between 500,000 and 700,000 barrels of crude oil a day from Canada's oil sands to the U.S. Gulf Coast. U.S. President Barack Obama in January denied a permit for the 1,700-mile pipeline, a decision that prompted Republican criticism that the president was not doing everything possible to create jobs and combat high gasoline prices. Obama defends policy on pipeline . Supporters, including the oil industry, also say the pipeline would lessen the country's dependence on oil imported from volatile regions. Opponents, including environmentalists, say the pipeline might leak and that it would lock the United States into a particularly dirty form of crude that might ultimately end up being exported. ""With this new route submitted and the state of Nebraska acting to move forward, the president is running out of excuses for blocking the Keystone pipeline any longer,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told CNN. ""With a veto-proof majority in the House supporting Keystone, the president is becoming increasingly isolated in his opposition to this job-creating energy project. He should listen to the voices of the American people and unlock the project so we can get Americans working and address high gas prices."" Obama announced in March that he would approve a portion of the pipeline, a part that runs from Cushing, Oklahoma -- a key repository of U.S. oil -- to the Gulf. He had said he was always in favor of permitting that portion, even when he blocked the full project. BP announces settlement over 2010 spill . The other portion of the pipeline had stirred concerns of Nebraskans worried about underground water supplies. An aquifer in Nebraska provides drinking water for much of the state. They fear a pipeline burst would allow oil to seep into the Ogallala Aquifer, a massive water table beneath the Great Plains and one of the largest in the world. The aquifer provides drinking water for much of the state and is important for Nebraska's agricultural economy. The previous route of the Keystone pipeline would have crossed the U.S. border in Montana, shortcutting an existing pipe that enters the United States in North Dakota. Currently, there are not enough pipelines to take the oil being produced in Canada and North Dakota to refineries and terminals on the Gulf. That means Midwest refineries can pay lower prices to get it. Giving the Canadian oil easier access to the Gulf means the glut in the Midwest goes away, making it more expensive for the region, but it would increase the amount of that oil available to global markets. The House on Wednesday approved a Republican bill that aims to fast-track the Keystone project as part of another 90-day extension of federal transportation funding. The 293-127 vote allows Boehner to begin negotiations with Senate Democrats over a longer-term funding measure for road, rail and bridge projects.","NEW: ""The president is running out excuses"" to block pipeline, John Boehner says .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Former NBA referee Tim Donaghy was released on $250,000 bail after pleading guilty Wednesday to two felonies related to wagering on games he officiated and supplying inside information on games to others. Tim Donaghy was an NBA referee for 13 years. He worked more than 700 games in his career. ""Today's guilty plea and charges serve as a warning that easy money often comes at a high price,"" said U.S. Attorney Roslynn Mauskopf. Two of Donaghy's alleged co-conspirators -- James Battista, also known as ""Baba"" and ""Sheep,"" and Thomas Martino -- were also arraigned Wednesday for involvement in the gambling ring. Neither of them entered a plea, and both also have been released on an unsecured $250,000 bond. Earlier, Donaghy, a 13-year veteran referee, stood before Judge Carol Bagley Amon in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, and admitted taking antidepressants to cope with a severe gambling addiction that has cost him his reputation and career.  Watch Donaghy's attorney talk about his client expressing remorse » . Donaghy received payments for providing co-conspirators with winning picks based on classified information he obtained as an official with the league, prosecutors said in an affidavit. He tipped his co-conspirators through the use of encoded language based on information about players' physical condition and information about the relationship between referees and players in the league. The two felony counts -- conspiracy to engage in wire fraud and transmitting wagering information to other individuals -- carry a combined maximum sentence of 25 years. Prosecutors said Donaghy's guilty plea was made in exchange for cooperating in other investigations surrounding organized crime members and gambling on professional sports. According to the affidavit, Battista and Martino met in Philadelphia in December 2006 and arranged to pay Donaghy $2,000 for each winning pick. Weeks into the scheme, Battista and Martino increased the pay to $5,000 per winning pick because of the accuracy of Donaghy's tips. The three-man operation used Martino as the middleman between Battista, who placed the bets, and Donaghy, who gave his picks to Martino by using the coded language. While Donaghy told the court Wednesday he did bet on NBA games, no charges on that issue were included in the plea deal. NBA Commissioner David Stern has termed Donaghy's actions a betrayal, and he said they were an isolated incident that did not involve other NBA officials. ""We think we have here a rogue isolated criminal,"" Stern said in a July news conference. ""We will continue with our ongoing and thorough review of the league's officiating program to ensure that the best possible policies and procedures are in place to protect the integrity of our game,"" Stern said in a statement Wednesday. Lamell McMorris, spokesman for the National Basketball Referees Association, called the situation ""a truly unfortunate case of wrongdoing by one of our own."" ""We recognize that a cloud has descended upon all referees, but we are committed to showing the public that this was an isolated event and that NBA officiating is conducted at the highest levels of honesty, integrity and fairness,"" McMorris said in a statement.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As George W. Bush spends his final days in office, a national poll suggests that two-thirds of Americans see his presidency as a failure. President Bush gives his farewell address to the nation on Thursday at the White House. Sixty-eight percent of those questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Sunday said that Bush's eight years in the White House were a failure, with 44 percent saying this was because of his personal shortcomings and 22 percent blaming the failure on circumstances beyond his control. Thirty-one percent said they consider Bush's presidency a success. Half of those polled say the United States could be better off today if Al Gore had been elected president in 2000 rather than Bush, with 27 percent saying the country would be worse off if Gore had won. Twenty-two percent say things would be about the same. ""Due to the Florida recount, Bush had the misfortune of coming into office under controversial circumstances,"" CNN polling director Keating Holland said. ""A lot of Americans apparently remember those circumstances and now wish things had gone a little differently."" Only 3 percent of those questioned say Bush was one of the greatest presidents in the nation's history. Forty-six percent rate him a poor president. ""That's three times higher than the number who gave a failing grade to his father or Ronald Reagan when they left office, and it's 27 points higher than Bill Clinton in 2001,"" Holland said. Thirty-one percent approve of Bush's performance in the White House, his final approval rating as president. ""The good news for Bush: That 31 percent figure is 7 points higher than it was in November, a typical 'nostalgia bump' that most outgoing presidents get,"" Holland added. ""The bad news is that except for the rating Richard Nixon has when he resigned, that's the lowest approval rating an outgoing president has received in the six decades of scientific public opinion polling."" The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted from January 12 to 15, with 1,245 adult Americans questioned by telephone.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Secret Service continued to be rocked Thursday by allegations of its agents' transgressions, though one U.S. government official cautioned against assuming there are systemic problems or that they are not properly investigated. The new claims include an account stemming from El Salvador described by CNN affiliate Seattle TV station KIRO as very similar to the Colombia prostitution scandal purportedly involving members of the Secret Service and other government agencies. The U.S. government official acknowledged there had been missteps among Secret Service members, while adding that such problems are to be expected given the agency's 147-year history. Amid calls by some Republicans for a broader congressional-led investigation, the official was also quick to defend the government's internal review process and the role of the Secret Service's Office of Professional Responsibility in dealing with that agency. ""We have had employees that have engaged in misconduct,"" the official said. ""People make mistakes."" Reports of other incidents involving members of the agency, which is charged with protecting the president and other top officials, as well as investigating criminal activity, have been brought to Congress, a congressional source said Thursday. That includes the incident in El Salvador, which the congressional source said the Secret Service has told Congress it is looking into as well. The KIRO report cited an unnamed U.S. government contractor who worked extensively with the Secret Service advance team in San Salvador before President Barack Obama's trip there in March 2011. The source said he was with about a dozen Secret Service agents and a few U.S. military specialists at a strip club in the city a few days before Obama arrived. Cartagena investigation not over, Secret Service says . The men drank heavily at the club, and most of them paid extra for access to a VIP section where they were provided sexual favors in return for cash, the source told the station. The station reported that the strip club's owner corroborated the allegations. The owner confirmed that a large number of agents, and some military escorts, ""descended on his club"" that week and were there at least three nights in a row, KIRO reported. The owner said his club routinely takes care of high-ranking employees of the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador as well as visiting agents from the FBI and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, KIRO said. The owner said his reputation for ""security"" and ""privacy"" makes his strip club popular with ""those who want to be discreet."" The government contractor source said he told the agents it was a ""really bad idea"" to take the strippers back to their hotel rooms, but several agents bragged that they ""did this all the time"" and ""not to worry about it,"" KIRO reported. KIRO investigative reporter Chris Halsne told the CBS show ""This Morning"" on Thursday that he considers his source very credible, and he later told CNN that he had checked billing records, receipts, credentials and other information to confirm the contractor was with the Secret Service in Central America at the time of the incident. The source told him about the alleged scandal last year, while Halsne was in El Salvador on a different story. Halsne said he pressed for details at that time, but the man didn't want any information from him to be used then in a news story. After the allegations involving Secret Service agents in Colombia surfaced, Halsne again pressed his source, who this time assented to the use of his account in the KIRO report. CNN cannot independently confirm the allegations. Responding to the KIRO report, Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan said, ""The recent investigation in Cartagena (Colombia) has generated several news stories that contain allegations by mostly unnamed sources. Any information brought to our attention that can be assessed as credible will be followed up on in an appropriate manner."" Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Thursday that his department is not investigating any of its troops about the reported incident in El Salvador. But the State Department is questioning its El Salvador embassy staff about the allegations, spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Thursday. The Drug Enforcement Administration also is prepared to look into, ""in an appropriate manner and immediately,"" allegations that it deems ""credible"" regarding its agents in El Salvador, agency spokesman Rusty Payne said. But he added that, while the DEA has seen news reports, ""We are unaware of any allegations of misconduct."" Sen. Chuck Grassley -- the top Republican in his chamber's Judiciary Committee, which was briefed Wednesday by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano on the Colombia scandal -- said the KIRO report ""only reaffirms the need for independent investigations by the (Homeland Security Department's independent) inspector general."" ""There are rumors flying about various incidents over several years about the conduct of Secret Service personnel, as well as other law enforcement and military personnel in locations around the world,"" the Iowa Republican said. ""The only way to put to rest the rumors of a much wider problem is for the allegations to receive transparent and independent reviews."" Another Republican on that committee, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, called for Congress itself to investigate ""as part of our oversight responsibilities."" But Sen. Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat and Judiciary Committee member, disagreed and said Napolitano's investigation needs to come first. ""After that, Congress should look into it and see what went wrong and what could be changed,"" he said. The Washington Post reported Thursday that an unnamed source said such behavior is part of the culture at the Secret Service and not a one-time occurrence. Napolitano: Obama has full confidence in director . The Secret Service said it has no comment on the Post story, but a Secret Service official, who was not authorized to comment on the continuing investigation, said, ""It's difficult for the Secret Service to defend against this,"" referring to the Post's article. ""The reaction by our leadership speaks for itself,"" the official told CNN, referring to the Colombia incident. ""Everyone was sent home. There's an investigation. We have taken action regarding the agents."" Spokesman Jay Carney said Thursday that the White House would not comment on unconfirmed reports about other incidents, saying questions should be directed to the Secret Service. The alleged prostitution scandal in Colombia occurred before the president's trip this month to a pan-American summit in Cartagena. Secret Service and U.S. military members are said to have consorted with prostitutes. Nine Secret Service members have resigned or are being forced out as a result of the scandal. The military has launched its own investigation into 12 troops who were in Colombia in advance of Obama's visit. The U.S. Southern Command said Thursday that the latest soldier included in this inquiry had ""duty at the White House Communications Agency,"" which is part of the military. Fresh off a meeting with Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee told CNN's ""OutFront"" on Thursday that she's learned the agency -- besides setting up working groups focused on its culture and outreach efforts, including to women -- will institute several measures in light of the uproar. These include having a ""professional development or personnel officer (go) on every trip the agents take out of the country,"" barring agents from being ""associated with any place of bad acts"" such as strip clubs and mandating that ""no foreign nationals will be allowed in"" an agent's hotel room. ""If this is the culture, then they want to immediately put it to rest,"" the Texas Democrat said, explaining the Secret Service's rationale. CNN's Brian Todd, Dan Lothian, Carol Cratty, Tom Cohen and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","NEW: A congresswoman says the Secret Service will institute steps to prevent future issues .

"(CNN) -- Phone and tablet owners used to spend most of their time surfing the Web. Now they're using apps, according to data from Flurry Analytics. A year and a half ago, mobile users tended to spend considerably more time -- an average of 64 minutes per day -- using the Web browser on their phone or tablet. By comparison, they spent only 43 minutes per day in apps. Now mobile users now spend an average of 94 minutes per day using apps, but just 72 minutes browsing the mobile Web, according to Flurry's report, which was released earlier this month on the company's blog. This doesn't necessarily mean mobile users are spending nearly three hours per day looking at their phones. Flurry's Web and app statistics came from different sources. But, overall, we do appear to be spending much more time looking at our phones than we used to. What's driving the growth in time spent in mobile apps? According to Flurry, consumers are using their apps more frequently. That is, the number of daily sessions is growing, although the duration of those sessions is not. Flurry predicts that smartphone users will continue to spend even more time proportionally with apps vs. the mobile Web -- and in fact, from June to December 2011, they observed that average daily time spent on the mobile Web decreased slightly. ""Users seem to be substituting websites for applications, which may be more convenient to access throughout the day,"" the report said. Why is the mobile Web holding our attention less? According to Flurry, it might be because Facebook's app is so popular. ""This drop appears to be driven largely by a decrease in time spent on (Facebook's mobile website). In June 2011, the average Facebook user spent over 33 minutes on average per day on the (mobile) website. Today, that number is below 24 minutes. ... (Mobile users) are increasingly accessing (Facebook and other) online services through mobile applications."" Once Facebook is factored out of those statistics, Flurry notes that average time spent elsewhere on the mobile Web actually grew by about 2% in the same time frame. It's worth noting that Flurry is not a disinterested party here. This company sells mobile application analytics and an advertising platform that can be incorporated into mobile apps. Advertisers are very interested in the amount of time that people might be exposed to their ads. But the mobile Web, mobile browsers, and the nature of mobile apps are changing fast. More and more sites are being built using the latest Web markup language, HTML5, which gives websites more app-like features. For instance, HTML5 supports geolocation, makes Web forms easier to fill out on your phone, supports coding scripts that enable custom features, and it also loads multimedia elements faster in Web pages. Consequently, more and more mobile apps will actually be delivered through the mobile Web browser -- making them Web apps. Want to see this in action? Visit YouTube or Twitter via the Web browser on your phone or tablet. You'll see a lot of conspicuously app-like functionality. In November Adobe announced that it was finally abandoning development of Flash for mobile browsers, and refocusing on HTML5 for delivering interactive features and video -- the death rattle of a long struggle in which Apple resisted letting Flash run on its iOS mobile operating system. With this turnabout, many designers began converting Flash-based websites (especially ad-supported ones) to HTML5. The rise of HTML5 mobile Web apps could also eat into profits from today's leading app marketplaces. HTML5 Report noted, ""The mass migration to HTML5 will eliminate the need to rely on companies like Apple and Google, which take up to 30% of all revenues generated from applications."" That's a powerful financial incentive for app developers, digital publishers, and online services to start deploying more Web apps. There's another bonus: ""Native"" apps are built to run on a specific platform. That's why so many apps come in separate versions for the iPhone, Android and other mobile platforms. Building, updating and supporting all those separate pieces of software is fairly expensive and complex. But HTML5 is inherently cross-platform -- which means you build it once and it can run on any mobile device with a sufficiently advanced browser. And of course, users must download and install most native mobile apps in order to run them on their device. That's a considerable hurdle -- only one in four mobile apps really engages mobile users, and 26% of all apps downloaded are opened only once and then never used again.

"(CNN) -- Six major Chinese websites have launched a joint site dedicated to eradicating online rumors, as part of Beijing's efforts to clean up false information on the country's wildly popular microblogs, state media reports. The rumor-busting website -- the name of which translates as the ""websites jointly debunking rumors platform"" -- allows users to forward on suspect content for verification. The website, with guidance from the Chinese government, will then issue a ""correct"" version of the information. The web giants participating in the platform include Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like microblogging service, and major search engines including Baidu and Sogou, reported state-run Xinhua. The website, which launched Thursday, has already published and corrected nearly 100,000 pieces of misinformation, according to the state-run Global Times. It would also alert Internet users to phishing scams. China has more Internet users than any other country, with more than 500 million people online, and an estimated 300 million microblog users. Although the services are censored -- with sensitive terms blocked and posts deleted -- the speed with which information can be disseminated has proven a headache for Beijing. While the microblogs have been used to disseminate false information -- popular posts include reports of extraterrestrial sightings, and bogus pictures have circulated with false reports of natural disasters -- they have also become a forum for spreading news of scandals, protests and venting public anger at incidents such as the Wenzhou bullet train crash. After that incident, which focused public opinion against authorities, a senior government official visited the headquarters of Sina and urged the internet firm to curb the spread of ""false information,"" while state media ran editorials comparing online rumors to heroin and cocaine in terms of the social damage they caused. Social media companies began suspending users for posting what they deemed to be rumors. The state-run Global Times has commended the government's latest initiative in its rumor-busting campaign as ""a laudable step,"" saying that rumors could ""can cause widespread panic, disturb the order of society and damage the government's credibility."" The editorial said that online rumor prevention was ""a challenge faced by most countries,"" and pointed out that the U.S.'s Federal Emergency Management Agency had launched a ""rumor control"" service in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. But critics see the ongoing anti-rumor campaign as an attempt to censor criticism and manage public opinion. David Bandurski, a researcher at the University of Hong Kong's China Media Project, wrote in a 2011 blog that the government's anti-rumor campaign was effectively ""sugarcoating censorship as a kind of public health measure,"" and observed that the government used the rumor-policing function to effectively shut down debate on contentious topics, without necessarily accounting why a given statement was false: ""A rumor is what the government says it is."" China's rumor-busting efforts come as British authorities grapple with their own challenges with online speech, as calls escalate for action to prevent abuse against women on social media. The issue ignited when feminist Caroline Criado-Perez received a barrage of rape threats via Twitter after petitioning to have women displayed on British banknotes. A politician who spoke out in support of her also received rape threats, while bomb threats were directed at a number of women journalists on Twitter. A 25-year-old man was arrested in northeastern England Tuesday on suspicion of harassment, the Metropolitan Police said, while investigations were ongoing in relation to the more recent complaints.

"(EW.com) -- Two years ago, Steve Jobs' death was followed by a tidal wave of commentary (the tributes, the Walter Isaacson biography, the why-the-iPod-is-as-major-an-invention-as-the-lightbulb analysis). As a result, most viewers will go into ""Jobs,"" a biopic about the Apple co-founder and black-turtlenecked guru of the technocratic age, knowing two fundamental things about him: that he was a visionary perfectionist obsessed with melding technological form and function into products that would tickle the hearts and minds of the people who used them; and that he was so possessed by that mission that he could be a control-freak dictator, a fanatic, an over-the-top jerk. Still, watching Jobs, with its basic warts-and-all accuracy and shrewd, unsweetened performance by Ashton Kutcher (who was obviously cast because he looks like Jobs, but who bites into the role with his incisors), I was surprised and frequently compelled by what a starkly honest portrait it is. The movie opens in 1974, when Jobs is a shaggy, barefoot college dropout. He picks up on the inventiveness of his friend, Steve Wozniak (Josh Gad), who has figured out how to hook up a keyboard to a television monitor. Jobs then fast-talks (or is it strong-arms?) his way into a deal to sell 50 of these contraptions to a local retailer. They've got just two months to build the machines, and the film neatly re-enacts the eager-beaver, geek-in-the-garage intensity that is the founding image of the home-computer age. When Wozniak, a burly nerd who works on this stuff mostly so that he can feel like one of the guys, takes out his trusty soldering iron to attach transistors to a flat green board, Jobs channels the early paradox of computer culture: that to us the gizmos seemed light, virtual, magical, but to the people who invented them, they were built, diode by diode. At the same time, almost everything we see Jobs do that doesn't involve designing computers is unconscionable. He's so possessed with getting his company off the ground that when his girlfriend announces she's pregnant, he treats it as an imposition, something he had nothing to do with, and he develops the (pathological) conviction that the child isn't his. At work, his inspirational mission statements begin to teeter into harangues. As the movie goes on, Jobs evolves from a grouchy hippie to a corporate sharpie in three-piece suits, and Kutcher lets his voice get more and more crisp with grandiosity, so that he's not talking, he's lecturing, because he's the only one who grasps the inner truth of computer design as transcendence. He runs Apple as if it were an est seminar. Anyone who isn't a fellow true believer is out the door. (Even most of the true believers don't get stock options.) Like ""The Social Network,"" Jobs is a technology yarn that's really a high-wire business story. The essential tale it tells is that Steve Jobs, in the years after he founded Apple, became so obsessed with creating the perfect home-computer product that he turned into a bad businessman, tossing away millions of dollars in research, and bogging the company down while he fetishized perfecting the Macintosh. A lot of the movie is about his battles with executives, board members, and John Sculley (Matthew Modine), the CEO he hires away from Pepsi. They all start off as Jobs' comrades and end up his enemies. I'm a sucker for these kinds of big-money power faceoffs, and Joshua Michael Stern, the director of Jobs, stages them well, yet with a one-thing-after-another quality that doesn't allow any one character to become somebody we care about. Dermot Mulroney plays Mike Markkula, the original investor in Apple, who sticks by Jobs for two decades and ends up getting thrown over the side. I guess we're supposed to be drop-kicked by this the way we were by Mark Zuckerberg's lack of personal loyalty in The Social Network, but the comparison just reveals the difference between the two films. In ""The Social Network,"" the human drama behind the founding of Facebook is volcanic. In Jobs, Gad's deadpan flip performance as Wozniak strikes the most relatable note in the movie, but the only thing we're really arrested by, apart from the spectacle of Jobs' bad behavior, is seeing him talk about computers. The ironic thrust of the movie is that Jobs' humanity is there in that perfectionistic insanity. He pushes and pushes to make home computers more and more appealing, accessible, and user-friendly, and that's his great gift to the world. Jobs gets tossed out of his own company because he's too far ahead of his time. (Ultimately, of course, he came back to Apple and triumphed.) Getting ousted must have been devastating, but Jobs doesn't really take us on that personal journey with him. The movie's fall-and-redemption narrative is generic, abstract. And maybe that's because the reason that this movie even exists â€” the notion that Steve Jobs is The One Who Changed Our Lives â€” has been, to put it mildly, a little overhyped. He didn't invent the personal computer, although he did refine it into something more seductively handy and even beautiful. Personally, I'm a devotee of Steve Jobs' products, but even as Jobs sticks to the facts of Jobs' life (and what a difficult person he could be), the movie gets a little too caught up in his legend.

"Boston (CNN) -- James ""Whitey"" Bulger was one of the most ""vicious, violent and calculating criminals to ever walk the streets of Boston,"" prosecuting attorney Fred Wyshak told the jury Monday as closing arguments began after 35 days of testimony in Bulger's trial. Bulger is accused of 19 killings and 13 counts of extortion and money laundering during a 20-year ""reign of terror"" that defined South Boston from the early '70s through 1995, when Bulger fled Boston. The prosecution took close to three and a half hours for its closing. The defense took over two and a half hours to make its case, then the prosecution had the final word in a rebuttal. The jury will begin deliberating the fate of the alleged crime boss Tuesday. Defense attorney J.W. Carney summed up his case by questioning the credibility of prosecution witnesses, some of whom came to court with extensive criminal resumes and who had worked out deals with the government in exchange for testifying against Bulger. ""If you cannot say in your deliberation that I personally can believe (prosecution witnesses) beyond a reasonable doubt, then the government cannot prove its case about the alleged murders,"" Carney told the jury. ""The government is buying the testimony of these witnesses. The currency used here (is) how much freedom someone is going to get. What the government can pay the individual is the individual's freedom,"" Carney continued. Earlier, prosecutor Wyshak said Bulger and his partner ""plotted, they schemed, they robbed they murdered together, they were also informants together."" Prosecutors contend Bulger was an FBI informant who used protection from rogue agents as he continued his life of crime. Defense attorneys have argued Bulger was not an informant, and that FBI bungling was key in the case. ""If there is one thing you heard during this trial, it's how secretive that relationship is,"" Wyshak said to the jury Monday. ""The last thing a criminal wants ... is for people to know he's an informant."" But he also said that it ""doesn't matter whether or not Bulger is an FBI informant when he put the gun to the head of Arthur Barrett and pulled the trigger."" Arthur ""Bucky"" Barrett died after being shot in the head in 1983. ""It's not about whether or not the FBI in Boston was a mess,"" he said. ""... It's about whether or not the defendant is guilty of crimes charged in the indictment."" He added, ""When he puts a gun in the stomach of Mr. (Michael) Solimando and tells him you own me $400,000, it doesn't matter if he is an informant or not, it doesn't matter whether or not the FBI is leaking information to him."" The defense rested its case Friday with no rebuttal from the government. During their weeklong defense, Bulger's lawyers seemed to have three goals: . One: Try to cast doubt on who killed two of the 19 victims, both of them women. Two: Shift the blame onto the FBI, specifically agents who either did nothing or did too little to prevent several killings. Three: Convince the jury that Bulger was not an FBI informant, a notion prosecutors called ""ludicrous"" in light of his FBI informant card and a 700-page file loaded with ""tips"" on rival gang members. In closing arguments, defense attorney Hank Brennan told jurors why he thinks the government has made Bulger's informant status the crux of its case. ""Think about why it's so important, if it's not an issue, why do they keep bringing it up,"" Brennan posed to jurors . Brennan explained that other than to ""embarrass"" his client, the government was boasting Bulger's informant status to cover up years of corruption. ""If he's not an informant, think of the liability,"" he said, recounting instance after instance where government officials as high as strike-force attorneys in the Justice Department protected Bulger throughout his criminal career. Prosecution defends plea deals . Defense attorneys also attacked the credibility of gangsters who became star witnesses for the prosecution, testifying under immunity after they learned Bulger was an informant for the FBI for nearly two decades. Wyshak on Monday defended the government's unsavory plea deals with those gangsters, three of whom together implicated Bulger in the 19 murders and various acts of extortion. ""The government didn't choose them, Bulger chose them,"" Wyshak said. ""The only thing worse than making a deal with (former hit man) John Martorano would have been not making a deal with John Martorano."" Wyshak said the government ""held its nose and made the deal."" It took prosecutors 90 minutes to detail the 19 murders Bulger is accused of, showing photos of each of the victims and the crime scenes. Bulger is not charged with delivering the fatal blow in all of the murders, but is charged with participating as part of a racketeering conspiracy. Wyshak called Bulger ""the leader of a very wide-ranging, broad organization,"" who is culpable for his co-conspirator's crimes. But Wyshak made clear Bulger was the alleged triggerman in some cases, recalling testimony from Bulger's partner, Steve ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi, about the murder of John McIntyre, whose remains were exhumed from a shallow makeshift grave in 2000. McIntyre had begun cooperating with the government on the shipment of weapons to the Irish Republican Army and 36 tons of marijuana imported into Boston Harbor. ""It's Arthur Barrett all over again, held at gunpoint, chained to the kitchen chair, interrogated,"" Wyshak said. Flemmi said he was holding McIntyre's body while Bulger was trying to strangle him with a rope, but the rope was too thick. After that didn't work, McIntyre practically begged for a bullet after Bulger asked him ""would you like one in the head,"" according to Flemmi. Wyshak got choked up at some points, trying to make Bulger appear utterly heartless. In talking about the murder of Paul McGonagle, Wyshak recalls that Bulger's former cohorts testified that whenever they passed the Neponset River, where McGonagle's remains were exhumed in 2000, Bulger said, ""'Drink up, Paulie.' That's the level of humanity that this defendant is operating at. ... And every time he goes by there its 'Drink up, Paulie.'"" Victim's mother warned FBI about an impending murder . Bulger was a fugitive for more than 16 years, after a crooked FBI agent told him in December 1994 he was about to be indicted on federal racketeering charges. The FBI track him down and arrested him 2011 in Santa Monica, California, where he had been living with his girlfriend under an alias. During the trial, jurors heard dramatic testimony from convicted gangsters, bookies, extortion victims, a disgraced FBI supervisor, ex-drug-dealers, retired FBI agents and relatives of people Bulger is accused of killing. Prosecutors called 63 witnesses. The defense called 10. Martorano testified for both sides, making a total of 72 witnesses over 35 days. Bulger never took the stand despite repeated hints from his lawyers throughout trial he would testify. In fact, Bulger seemed to want to testify. Questioned by Judge Denise Casper, Bulger called his decision a ""choice made involuntarily."" He claimed he had been given immunity for his crimes by the former head of New England's Organized-Crime Strike Force, Jeremiah O'Sullivan, now deceased. ""The evidence is overwhelming,"" Wyshak said as he concluded his closing argument. He called Bulger ""the leader of one of the most ruthless criminal organizations ever in Boston,"" one that ""wreaked havoc on this city for decades."" ""In his capacity as the leader, he is legally responsible for it all, as either a principle an aider and abettor or conspirator."" 'Bulger: I didn't get a fair trial' Bulger, who lost his temper several times during the trial, appeared angry, shaking his finger at the judge and claiming he was ""choked off from making an adequate defense."" ""I didn't get a fair trial. This is a sham. Do what ya's want with me,"" Bulger said. Families of the victims have been in court every day of the trial. The wife of one of the victims shouted ""You're a coward!"" Patricia Donahue's husband, a truck driver, was killed in the crossfire of a slaying Bulger allegedly committed. She later explained Bulger had a chance to take the stand and tell the truth. Flemmi testified as one of the government's star witnesses, and he said that he saw Bulger strangle the two women. The defense team, however, presented evidence that Flemmi had the greater motive to kill the women -- his girlfriend and his stepdaughter. Bulger's attorneys release photos designed to show his softer side . The girlfriend, Debra Davis, was about to leave him for another man. The defense recalled Martorano, who testified that Flemmi admitted he ""accidentally strangled"" the 26-year-old woman. Flemmi acknowledged he lured Davis to a home but says Bulger strangled her because she was talking too much and had become a liability. Wyshak recalled testimony that Bulger always needed to take a nap after strangling or shooting his victims to death. In his closing argument, prosecutor Wyshak told the jurors they ""don't have to decide who strangled Debbie Davis."" ""He doesn't need to be the one that strangled her to be criminally liable,"" he said. ""If he is a co-conspirator or he aids and abets, he is just as liable as he is if he puts his hands around her neck and strangles the life out of her."" A number of retired FBI agents and supervisors also took the stand, many testifying that they believed Bulger should have been shut down as an informant because he wasn't providing any useful information. The agents said they never pressed the issue because apparently FBI headquarters felt Bulger was useful in taking down the New England Mafia. There are 18 jurors,12 with six alternates. Eleven are men and seven are women. Man arrested in death of alleged Bulger extortion victim .","NEW: Both sides make closing arguments in the trial of James ""Whitey"" Bulger .

"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (CNN)  -- Youk Chhang knows the truth about the Cambodian genocide perhaps better than anyone in the world. Youk Chhang runs the Documentation Center of Cambodia, which has documented 20,000 mass graves. He was 13 when the Khmer Rouge came to power. Separated from his family, forced into slave labor, beaten nearly to death for stealing rice for his pregnant sister, he saw the horrors firsthand. His mother lost a daughter and four siblings; 30 years later she still searches for them, hoping they survived. Chhang survived by eating whatever he could find. After the fall of the Khmer Rouge, it took him months to walk home to his family. Eventually, he fled to safety in the United States. ""Food was ... more important than God,"" Chhang said. ""I always wish to have a bowl of rice. And one good night's sleep. That's all I wanted. I would do anything for it.""  Watch Youk Chhang talk about what he ate, how he survived » . But the ghosts of the genocide brought Chhang back to Cambodia. And for more than a decade, he has run the Documentation Center of Cambodia. ""DC-Cam,"" as it is known, is the world's largest repository of information about the Cambodian genocide. It holds hundreds of thousands of documents, photos and films as well as interviews with both survivors and former Khmer Rouge members. Chhang said he believes the Khmer Rouge kept such careful records as a measure of their success -- a trophy of sorts. ""At each time when they kill a person, they document it so that they can measure their success one step forward,"" Chhang said. ""If they kill two, then two step forward. If they kill five, then five step forward. So to them, it's a golden file. But I mean, to us it's crime against humanity."" DC-Cam has located and mapped nearly 200 prisons and 20,000 mass graves across the country. For Chhang and DC-Cam, the work is critical to preserving memory and promoting justice.  Watch as Chhang takes CNN's Christiane Amanpour into DC-Cam's secured vault » . Today in Cambodia, a tribunal is under way to try five of the surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge -- 30 years after their alleged crimes. DC-Cam is providing much of the evidence for use in the trial, evidence that makes plain the facts of the genocide, the scope of the losses and the personal and national grief. Chhang said he hopes the tribunal will help Cambodians move forward -- and help heal the nation he loves. But even now, the way forward is difficult. Chhang has dedicated a lifetime of work, research, preservation and advocacy to his mother, whose bravery and sacrifice inspired him. Even though his mother survived and they shared much of the same pain and many of the same losses, the two do not talk about what happened. Some in Cambodia are anxious to forget and forgive. Others are angry and searching for justice. Many, like Chhang, said that only by knowing, exploring and exposing the truth will Cambodia be able to rectify its past -- and secure a healthy future.","Youk Chhang was 13 when the Khmer Rouge came to power in Cambodia .

"Cape Town, South Africa (CNN) -- Judging by the ferocity with which Gerrie Nel pursued a case of ""planned and premeditated"" murder against Oscar Pistorius at his bail hearing, it would not be unreasonable to assume the state had a strong case. From the outset, however, the veracity of the state's case appeared to dwindle. At the bail hearing in February, the then-lead investigator Hilton Botha crumbled on the stand and had to concede that there was little appreciable evidence gathered to back up the state's claims. Worse, he admitted serious breaches of investigation protocol, including the failure to wear protective foot coverings at the crime scene, thereby contaminating certain forensic evidence. Botha also had to concede that Pistorius' version of events was not implausible. This of course did not help Pistorius in the court of public opinion, as once the state's sensational claims were made they were immediately disseminated around the world. Nonetheless, much of the state's case was castigated by Magistrate Nair in his unusually long bail decision. Adding to the perception that the state's case is floundering, on Tuesday, rather than presenting their charges to which Pistorius would plead, the state requested a two-month postponement to conduct further investigations. This equivocation is in stark contrast to their initial aggression at the bail proceedings. The most interesting part of the postponement hearing was the stark warning the magistrate issued to the media and the state to act responsibly and avoid ""scandalising the sanctity of justice"" through a ""trial by media."" Read more: Pistorius judge warns of 'trial by media' Clearly he was referring to the leaked photographs of the crime scene which were recently published. The leaking of these pictures, as well as reports in local newspapers that numerous police cell phones have subsequently been confiscated, adds to the perception that the state is mismanaging this case. This begs the question: considering a litany of state missteps and the wild public speculation triggered at the bail proceedings, can Pistorius get a fair trial? Regarding his eventual trial in a court of law, the answer is clearly ""yes."" South Africa abandoned trial by jury in 1969. Pistorius' trial will thus be presided over by either a regional magistrate or a high court judge, possibly assisted by assessors. Judicial officers in South Africa are highly skilled and experienced and are keenly aware of their responsibility to apply the law in an impartial manner, guided by the evidence presented in court, not discussions occurring outside court. This much was inherently acknowledged by the magistrate's warning yesterday -- he did not focus on the fairness of the trial being damaged but rather the sanctity of the justice system being called into disrepute. Read more: Photos show Steenkamp's transformation . However, Pistorius is unlikely to fare as well in the court of public opinion. To many South Africans Pistorius' story of triumph over adversity came to symbolize the country's own story. His personal fallibility has thus touched an uncomfortable nerve, reminding the country of its own fallibility, and leading to an angry backlash. To this segment of society Pistorius is already guilty of murder -- irrespective of what the evidence ends up revealing. The state's bungles have only served to fuel the determination of Pistorius naysayers: if he is acquitted of murder it will not be put down to the fact that he was telling the truth, but because the state dropped the ball. This stance fails to acknowledge that even the best-run cases can result in an acquittal when the facts, as revealed through the evidence gathered, end up supporting an acquittal. So where does the evidence currently point? It is simply too soon to tell. What we can ascertain is what evidence is likely to become pivotal. For example, the question of whether or not Pistorius was wearing his prosthetics is critical. Thus the ballistics evidence will be critical. The state appears to be relying on a contention that he took the time to put on his prosthetics before firing through the bathroom door. This, they claim, shows premeditation. Read more: Oscar Pistorius heartbroken, uncle says . The defence has claimed he was not wearing his prosthetics, which left him feeling particularly vulnerable to a suspected intruder, thus flooding him with fear. The evidence at trial will eventually support one of these versions over the other. Before that evidence is offered in court, the public cannot be clairvoyant -- despite firmly held beliefs either way, we simply don't yet have enough information to know the truth. This is the purpose of a criminal trial, it is essentially a truth-finding mission and the rules of evidence and procedure are set up to enhance this. Hilton Botha, now retired from the police service, would do well to remind himself of this. He has given interviews to the media vociferously claiming Pistorius' guilt and affirming that he will be called at trial to testify for the state. With respect, more is required than a policeman's hunch to convict a person of murder. If he is trying to serve the interests of justice, rather than merely grinding an axe, he would do well to stop talking to the media and save his words for court.

"(CNN) -- The same George Zimmerman defense attorney who drew skepticism over his choice to tell a knock-knock joke during opening statements of his client's second-degree murder trial is again in an unflattering spotlight -- this time thanks to a family photo and social media. Friday, a photo posted on photo-sharing site Instagram from the account ""mollywestttt"" showed a picture of two girls and veteran criminal defense attorney Don West eating generously-sized ice cream cones. A comment below the photo from mollywestttt read: ""We beat stupidity celebration cones,"" along with ""#zimmerman,"" ""#defense"" and ""#dadkilledit."" Zimmerman defense team communications director Shawn Vincent confirmed the photo came from Don West's 23-year-old daughter, Molly, featured in the photo along with West and another of his four daughters. Vincent said it was a tradition in West's family to go out for ice cream together. After court let out this week, West and two of his daughters went to get ice cream and took a picture to commemorate it ""like old times."" As negative comments about the sensitivity of the photo picked up steam Friday, Molly West's account was deactivated later that day. In a statement, West said, ""Sometimes we're deeply disappointed by the things our children do. But we love them anyway, and we move on."" The photo appears to have been taken Tuesday, and posted sometime later that day or Wednesday. Vincent said he hasn't heard from Molly West on what she specifically meant by it. He acknowledges the photo reflects on the defense poorly. ""It doesn't reflect how Don feels. And we're aware that the themes sure this case are very apparently race, self-defense and gun control and we're aware that none of those things or that debate is going to be resolved in this court room,"" Vincent said. ""How we conduct ourselves as we move towards whatever the verdict is going to be, we know reflects on all those issues.

"(EW.com) -- In the rude, antic, and brazenly funny ""Wedding Crashers"" (2005), Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn played overgrown arrested-development cases who won us over from their very first whopping lie onward. At the time, the two actors were already in their mid-30s, but they were still able to mount a bad-boy generational assault against all things civil and decent. ""The Internship"" reunites Wilson, with his smarm-that-looks-like-sweetness (or is it the other way around?), and Vaughn, with his disaffected fast patter. The audience is still rooting for them — only this time the two are playing the older, stodgy guys. They're Nick (Wilson) and Billy (Vaughn), designer-watch salesman who lose their careers in what seems like the tick of a second hand. Tossed into a dead-end job market, without any real prospects, they talk their way into an internship on the sprawling, buzzy Silicon Valley campus of Google, where they're pitted against a bunch of brainiac 20-year-olds who live and breathe technology and don't get any of the pair's pathetically ancient pop-culture references (Stalag 17, anyone?). Directed by the workmanlike Shawn Levy (who made the Night at the Museum films and Date Night), the movie is a halfway clever cookie-cutter culture-clash comedy, but there's a reason that it lacks the highs of ""Wedding Crashers:"" The Internship puts us on the side of those who are trying to hold on to respectability, not tear it down. The movie was made with the cooperation of Google, which is why its basic attitude toward the search engine that changed the world is one of unironic reverence. True, the place can come off looking a bit goofy and obsessive. The leader of the internship program is Mr. Chetty (The Daily Show's Aasif Mandvi), a po-faced corporate guru who lights up whenever he extols the virtues of ethereal concepts like ''Googliness.'' And when the army of interns gets divvied up into a dozen competing teams, only one of which will ultimately land jobs there, Nick and Bill are stuck with the social outliers that no one else wants — the geeks among geeks. They're led by Lile (Josh Brener), a shrimpy, horn-rimmed genius who tries to fit in by saying things like ''fo shizzle.'' (He's clearly been saying that since he was about five.) The actors cast as Google interns are likable and mildly amusing in a ""Revenge of the Nerds"" 2013 way. But I wish that at least one of them had been given a major voice, a way of making the tech banter seem hilariously cool. The likeliest candidate would have been Stuart (Dylan O'Brien), with his sullen stare and open contempt for our heroes, but the character loses his superior edge over time, which is the movie's mistake. It's up to Nick and Bill to teach these brilliant losers how to live, and what that comes down to is showing them that it's fun to let go and do Tequila shots and dance like crazy and hit on people. How rebellious! The Internship was written by Vaughn and Jared Stern, and it's got little jabs of wit, like the scene in which Nick and Bill are duped into addressing a bald instructor in a wheelchair as ''Professor Charles Xavier'' (he is not pleased). A lot of the film is devoted to showing how the cult of technology and the human element don't need to be opposed; they can, and should, work hand in hand. That's a nice message (and it's certainly a swell advertisement for Google), but it's not a funny message. ""The Internship"" gets so caught up in healing the generational divide that it's ostensibly about — the analog dudes vs. the digital kids — that the movie ends up being just a pleasant collection of mild laughs. It needed more spin, more Googliness. Grade: B . CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly . © 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc.

"(CNN) -- Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky has been sentenced to a long prison term for sexually abusing boys, and for many people, this means that justice has been done. But in the complex crime of child sexual abuse, ""doing justice"" is rarely as simple as convicting and locking up the offender. For most victims of sexual abuse, sending the offender to jail is not the most important thing. Their top priority is to be believed, to receive an apology or to restore their sense of trust. Sandusky's victims may have been accorded belief, but the apology does not seem forthcoming, at least from Sandusky. And the sense of trust often takes a long time to repair. For the communities and families damaged by disclosures of sexual abuse, wounds continue to fester long after the cell door closes. There are almost always many who feel guilt or are blamed for having allowed the abuse or for mismanaging the situation and causing avoidable pain. The justice and mental health systems often don't do enough to help with all this collateral damage. But ""doing justice"" also means preventing future harm. Many victims ultimately come forward to prevent other children (sometimes their own siblings) from becoming victims. Law enforcement believes that putting abusers away for a long time keeps the community safe. But while convictions and incarcerations do prevent some future offenses, it is naive to think that we can prosecute our way to child safety in this crime. For example, a third of all child sex offenses occur at the hands of other youth (PDF), and these crimes are not likely to be prevented by greater incarceration, in part because few of these juveniles have records that would have allowed authorities to intervene. The key to real prevention is awareness and education. There is no question that the Sandusky case has advanced these goals. Certainly, campuses all over the country are reviewing their standards and educating their staff members to make sure it ""won't happen here."" But the Sandusky case also reminds us of how much more we potentially have to do. Nearly 50 years after mandatory reporting laws came into effect and 10 years after the priest abuse scandal, highly educated and well-meaning professionals still fail to do the right thing. Here are some changes that should be on our prevention agenda: . • Make abuse prevention, detection and management prominent in the curricula of graduate education in all human service fields. • Create off-the-shelf abuse prevention guidelines and educational materials that small and large youth-serving organizations can adopt and disseminate without a lot of expense. • Provide evidence-based prevention education for children and youth at all levels of the educational system. • Through schools, libraries and pediatricians, give parents the skills and vocabularies for talking about abuse with their kids. Finally, we need to see justice in these cases as a process, not just an outcome. Convictions may be obtained, but victims and families are left battered. Studies suggest that most cases with child victims take far too long to resolve in the legal system. Many victims and families complain that they aren't kept up to date on what is happening in the case and why. Victims' identities are often not protected. Investigative interviews and procedures can be intimidating and exhausting. Helpful mental health and support services are not readily available. At the same time, much is being done to make the process more victim-friendly. Child advocacy centers are being established all across the country. Law enforcement is being trained in child development skills and sensitive interviewing practices. Judges are being admonished to speed cases along. But we still have a long way to go before we can close cases like that of Jerry Sandusky with confidence that ""justice was done.""

"(CNN) -- An eastern Pennsylvania police chief who went on profanity-laced video rants against those who disagreed with him on gun laws has been suspended for 30 days without pay. The punishment wasn't for his diatribe though. The borough council in the coal town of Gilberton said that police Chief Mark Kessler used ""borough property for non-borough purposes without prior borough permission"" when he made the video where he's seen shooting semiautomatic and automatic weapons. Thousands of gun-rights activists descended on the town of 750 for the meeting, openly sporting firearms, CNN affiliate WPMT reported. ""I make no apologies and I have no regrets,"" a defiant Kessler told the council after its 5-1 vote, according to CNN affiliate WFMZ. He added he would be back ""30 days from tonight."" Soon afterward, Kessler posted a statement on his website saying that Mayor Mary Lou Hannon and two council members -- Eric Boxer and Daniel Malloy -- ""are conspiring behind closed doors for full termination. "" ""They needed to suspend first to allow themselves time to look for or make up any reason or lie,"" he said. Then, he added in all uppercase letters: ""HEY BOXER, MALLOY , HANNON, YOU'RE COWARDS, YOU'RE HACKS, YOU PRETEND TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION,YOU SICKEN ME !"" For her part, Mayor Hannon said the police chief has her backing. ""He has the right to freedom of speech,"" she told WPMT. ""I am a big supporter of the Constitution."" Kessler posted his videos to YouTube in mid-July. They went viral, generating a heated online debate that appeared to gain renewed traction last month when he posted a backhanded apology. Kessler did not respond to repeated requests by CNN for comment, but he told WFMZ at the time that he was not in uniform in the videos and was exercising in his First and Second Amendment rights. In the videos, Kessler rails against liberals for attempting to curb gun rights and Secretary of State John Kerry over his support of a recent U.N. arms treaty. At one point in the video, he dares Kerry to come and take his guns. ""It wasn't a threat. It was, 'if you want them come and take them,'"" Kessler told the television station by telephone. Kessler has been the town's police chief for 14 years ""without a mark against him,"" Hennon said. Kessler, an outspoken gun rights advocate, has a history of making provocative statements. He has been featured in a number of online videos discussing his views, given numerous interviews and helped organize gun rights rallies. The police chief also has claimed in a number of interviews to be the founder of the Constitutional Security Force, a gun rights advocacy group. In the video, Kessler wears a T-shirt with CSF emblazoned on it. On the CSF Web page, Kessler is identified as the group's president and is featured in his Gilberton police uniform. The latest videos have been picked up and copied on YouTube, with titles such as ""America's scariest police chief"" and ""Patriot police chief.""","The council says he used city property without permission .

"(CNN) -- Mississippi House Speaker Philip Gunn has invited gunmakers such as Colt to relocate to his state from others including Connecticut, where firearms have been a controversial issue since a school shooting there last December left 20 students and six adults dead. The gun industry in Connecticut is being attacked and ""demonized"" because of national politics, Gunn said in a letter this week to Colt's Manufacturing Company CEO Dennis Veilleux. He also invited gunmaker Magpul Industries Corp. of Colorado to relocate to Mississippi. Gunn, a Republican, said firearm manufacturers are ""under attack in anti-Second Amendment states."" ""In our state, you will not be criticized for providing goods to the law-abiding citizens who enjoy hunting, shooting or who just want the peace of mind that comes with the constitutional right to protect their families,"" Gunn wrote to Colt on Thursday. ""We welcome you with open arms!"" he said. In an interview with CNN affiliate WLBT, Gunn said having gunmakers move their operations to Mississippi is a ""natural match,"" saying the industry ""meshes well"" in a state with citizens who ""love to hunt, ... love to shoot, (and) people enjoy the peace of mind that comes from knowing they have the right to defend themselves."" U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, said Gunn sent letters to three gunmakers in his state and called Gunn's proposal ""preposterous."" Connecticut residents support the Second Amendment and responsible gun ownership, ""far from demonizing firearms products made here,"" Blumenthal said in a statement. ""This preposterous pitch to companies with long, successful histories in our state shows the need for national standards and statutes to reduce gun violence,"" the senator said. ""Competition among states for less protective laws is a race to the bottom that should be avoided. The poison of illegal gun trafficking respects no state boundaries and threatens to cause more horrific tragedies like Newtown and the 1,900 gun violence deaths that have occurred since then."" Newtown is the name of the Connecticut town where last December's mass shooting occurred, at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Representatives for Colt and Magpul couldn't be reached immediately for comment Friday. William ""Mo"" Cowan, interim U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, called Gunn's attempt ""gimmicky"" and predicted it wouldn't work to draw Smith & Wesson from its base in Springfield, according to CNN affiliate WGGB. That sentiment was echoed by Springfield's mayor, who said his city's and Massachusetts' skilled and educated workforce measured up favorably against those in Mississippi and other states. ""Smith & Wesson is not going anywhere,"" Mayor Dominic Sarno told WGGB, adding he still stands by his support for ""sensible gun control."" ""They've been a vital and good corporate citizen here in the city of Springfield.""","NEW: Massachusetts politicians predict the bid to lure Smith & Wesson to Mississippi will fail .

"(CNN) -- All the tech world's eyes will be on Apple Monday, when the computing giant's 24th annual Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off in San Francisco. As its name suggests, the weeklong gathering lets Apple host presentations and workshops for the people who make a living writing the apps and other software that run on its products. But its opening keynote almost always makes news. The conference has been the launching pad for two phones (the iPhone 3GS in 2009 and the iPhone 4 in 2010) and several new, or updated, Macs. This year, the former seems highly unlikely. The latter? Maybe not so much. Fans are clamoring for some excitement, because Apple hasn't introduced a major new product since the iPad Mini last October. And with growing competition from such rivals as Amazon and Samsung, there's always the chance that the secretive folks from Cupertino are cooking up something big. So here's a look at what to expect from WWDC 2013. Apple's keynote begins Monday at 1 p.m. ET. A new iOS . The safest bet for WWDC is that Apple will introduce iOS 7 to the world. For the first time, Apple vice president Jonny Ive is responsible for the update, and reports have suggested the mobile operating system will be ""black, white and flat all over."" Unnamed Apple sources have popped up on the Web, saying that much of the color, gloss and shine will be removed from the look of iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch screens in favor of a simpler black-and-white theme. Style aside, there will almost certainly be a host of new features to announce as well. Reports have centered on improved in-car support for Maps and Siri, along with new integration for third-party (and non-Google-owned) apps like video site Vimeo and photo site Flickr. The update also could bring Airdrop, which allows easy Wi-Fi sharing between Apple devices, to mobile. New MacBooks . The MacBook and MacBook Air laptops are both due to be updated, according to Apple's once-a-year pattern. And the timing is right: Intel just announced a more powerful processing chip. It will be a challenge for Apple to shrink the already ultra-slim MacBook Air much further. But if the rumors are true, the beefier MacBook Pro may give way to a new, sleeker version of itself. Apple also could introduce a refreshed Mac Pro desktop tower for those deep-pocketed office managers who prefer to order the freshest machines. A streaming-music service? It seems like only a matter of time before Apple leaps into the increasingly crowded streaming-music market led by Pandora, Spotify and others. Apple's been making deals with record labels such as Universal Music and Warner Music Group, which would allow them to stream songs to users as part of a free or paid-subscription service. Observers expect such a platform, possibly called iRadio, would exist apart from iTunes, Apple's digital-media service, and focus on mobile devices. Longshots . Sure, there are realistic expectations. Then there are the really fun ones. Hope springs eternal in the fanboy's breast, so we won't be the ones to shoot down hopes for a big, ""one more thing"" surprise. And, hey -- CEO Tim Cook has already teased ""exciting new product categories"" this year. According to observers, an Apple TV set has been on the verge of being released for years now. (Experts are just sure the company is going to roll out a TV set. Eventually.) A little over a year ago, there was a bizarrely specific Best Buy survey asking loyal customers about the ""concept"" of an Apple TV. It seems like too much of a real thing to never happen. But will it happen next week? Not likely. Joining the mythical ""iTV"" is an Apple watch -- another product everybody is sure is coming, despite Apple having said no such thing. Wearable tech is becoming a huge field and Apple would surely like to cool off some of the heat generated lately by Google Glass. A watch feels slightly more likely than a TV, but not by much. This fall, just in time for holiday shopping, seems a more likely release date for one or both. And, quite possibly, for a new iPhone. There have been some rumblings about a possible new iPad. It has been a little more than seven months since the iPad Mini was unveiled, though, and only four months since Apple offered a 128GB version of its bigger counterpart. So a new model would be a surprise. What do you want to see from Apple? Let us know in the comments.","Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off Monday .

"(CNN) -- China has halted imports of some New Zealand milk powders after a company disclosed that three batches of an ingredient used in sports drinks and baby formula tested positive for a strain of bacteria that causes botulism. The New Zealand-based Fonterra Group said Saturday that three batches of its whey protein tested positive for the Clostridium botulinum bacteria. Those batches weren't for use in Fonterra-branded products, but they said companies that used the whey protein in their products might issue recalls. Fonterra, the world's largest dairy exporter, said it had warned companies that bought the whey protein about the problem. ""As a result, these customers are urgently investigating whether any of the affected product, which contains a strain of Clostridium, is in their supply chains,"" the company said. Three of those clients have told Fonterra that their products are safe. ""Our technical teams have been working closely this weekend with Coca-Cola, Wahaha and Vitaco and have established that the process used to manufacture their products would kill the bacteria that was in the affected whey protein concentrate,"" Gary Romano, Fonterra's managing director of NZ Milk Products, said in a company statement. Wary Chinese mothers buy breast milk online . But China -- where at least six babies died from tainted milk powder in 2008 -- has halted all imports of New Zealand milk powders from New Zealand and Australia, New Zealand's Trade Minister Tim Groser said in an interview on television network TVNZ on Sunday. But in an update on its website, the New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries clarified that Chinese authorities had suspended imports of Fonterra-produced Whey Powder and Dairy Base powder, while also increasing inspection and supervision of New Zealand dairy products. ""China has not closed the market to all New Zealand dairy products,"" the ministry said. ""And it has also been quite specific about the range of Fonterra products which it has temporarily suspended."" Dairy is a key industry in New Zealand, making up about 3% of its GDP. The Trade Ministry said Australia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Vietnam also imported the product. Botulism can be fatal, with symptoms typically beginning within 36 hours of consuming contaminated food. The infection can result in paralysis and respiratory failure, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. In the 2008 scandal, milk powder was contaminated with melamine, a chemical commonly used in laminates, wood adhesives and flame retardants that can be used to mimic high-protein additives. Chinese authorities arrested more than 18 people and executed two in the contamination scandal, which saw thousands sickened in addition to the infant deaths. The company involved, Sanlu Group, was partially owned by Fonterra. Sanlu group later filed for bankruptcy. Two years later, a Fonterra-supplied company in China faced scrutiny over claims that their milk powder led to premature sexual development in infant girls. At the time, Fonterra said it remained ""100% confident about the quality of its products."" CNN's Mitra Mobasherat contributed to this report.","China halts imports of milk powders produced by a New Zealand company .
