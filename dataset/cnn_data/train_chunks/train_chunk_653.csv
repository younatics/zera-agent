Those of you having difficulty selling your house — and feeling sore at the idea of dropping the price by the odd £10,000 — spare a thought for property magnate Andreas Panayiotou, who has just been persuaded by estate agent Knight Frank to swallow a drop of £35 million. Heath Hall, his 14-bedroom mansion on The Bishops Avenue in Hampstead, North London, could now be yours for an absolute snip. For you, my friend, just £65 million. While you shake out your piggy bank to see if you can rustle up the readies, let me tell you what you would get for your money: a 25ft swimming pool, with a fully equipped gym and sauna, bathrooms thick with Italian marble, plus a private cinema as well as luxury bedrooms and kitchens. 'Hideous': Heath Hall on The Bishops Avenue in Hampstead, London, is described as vulgar by A.N. Wilson . 'More marble than the Taj Mahal': The 14-bedroom mansion is on sale for £65million . Opulent: The house comes complete with a 25ft indoor swimming pool . There is a climate-controlled wine cellar where you can store all your fine vintages (it has room for 600 bottles, so do feel free to invite some friends round), an entrance hall which would seem over-the-top in a royal palace and a billiards room. There’s just one drawback — glaringly obvious to anyone with taste, but perhaps not apparent to the owner. It is hideous. Heath Hall was constructed in the Edwardian era for sugar magnate William Park Lyle. He was the ‘& Lyle’ bit of Tate & Lyle. When he built it, you can be sure that although he was ‘new money’, he would have aped old taste. The oak-panelled hall and rooms would have had thick oriental carpets and the furniture would have put you in mind of an old English country house. Andreas Panayiotou has chosen a different path. He has gone for sheer swanky opulence. It is what I would call gold taps syndrome. Price drop: The house was put on the market for a guide price of £100million in 2011 but the price has been dropped after a lack of interest . Swanky: The house was originally built in the Edwardian era for the sugar magnate William Park Lyle . Bathrooms at Heath Hall have more marble than your average Italian high altar. But though tons of stone have been excavated from the best quarries to make them, they have not one ounce of personality. The cinema, with its pale purple walls and matching lilac sofas, reminds me of the swankiest restaurants in modern St Petersburg, where the Russian oligarchs hang out with their expensive women. It is as impersonally hideous as a brothel. (In fact, those St Petersburg restaurants often turn out to be brothels!) Heath Hall’s hallway probably looks, to the proud owner and to the designer, like Hollywood’s stateliest. But it sure as hell does not look like an English stately. It simply yells: ‘I’m rich — Very rich! My chandelier is bigger than your chandelier! I’m richer than you can imagine!’ Estate agent Tony Abrahmsohn, who specialises in the area, says that the world’s mega-rich believe The Bishops Avenue is one of the swankiest addresses in England, a sign to potential overseas billionaire buyers that they have really arrived. Spacious: There's plenty of room for leisure activity, the house has a large garden and tennis court area . It may be a sign that you have arrived, but it is also a sign that you have not, as it were, unpacked. In other words, you are not ready to be presented to polite society. Bernie Ecclestone, Joan Collins, and Lakshmi Mittal, the Indian businessman said to be the richest man in England, have all owned houses in The Bishops Avenue. Yet though their purchases make us gasp, though we might aspire to some of their wealth, they do not exactly fill most normal people with the smallest flicker of envy. In fact, when someone such as Tamara Ecclestone announces that she has spent £1 million on a crystal bath tub for her £50 million home, we feel revulsion. In this country, with its proud tradition of Empire and industry, we are no strangers to the rich. But on the whole, when big industrial magnates made money in the past, they tried to ape the taste and manners of the aristocracy. One of the first industrial millionaires in England was Josiah Wedgwood, patriarch of Britain’s finest pottery. He immediately built the poshest house you could imagine — Etruria Hall in Staffordshire. (He even invented a version of the first indoor lavatories for it). Private: Heath Hall is set behind its own large security gates . But although, like all self-made men, Wedgwood wanted to flaunt his wealth by having a big house, he also had perfect taste. That was how he had made his money, after all. So he built a house for himself which was like the house of a duke or an earl — only with better vases. We used to mock American vulgarity, and imagine that spectacularly ugly houses, such as Elvis Presley’s Gracelands or Michael Jackson’s Neverland Ranch, could only happen over there. But that is no longer true. I once had a university friend who, rather to everyone’s surprise, married a modern, super-rich member of the international jet-set. They moved into one of these Bishops Avenue houses, and I visited them there a few times. It was surely symptomatic that I could never guess whether they had bought the house or it was rented; whether they owned the furniture or it came with the property. All personality was absent. My friends long ago decamped to America. I often drive down The Bishops Avenue where their palace and Mr Panayiotou’s mansion are to be found — not because I mix with the oligarchs, but because it is a good short cut to my daughter’s school. Mega-rich Salman Rushdie lives here, or used to, with his pointless squillions, and Andreas Panayiotou may be the richest property developer in the road, but he is not the only one. It is a true billionaire’s row. Huge houses cower behind electrically operated high railings, and German shepherd dogs prowl to keep out nosy intruders such as myself. This is where the super-rich trade homes like commodities. During the first Gulf war, the Saudi royal family bought ten of the street’s mansions for use as boltholes in case they were  deposed. In recent years, the Russian and East European oligarchs have arrived as they move their billion-dollar oil and metal fortunes out of Russia. What the houses, and specially designed yachts, car interiors and private jets of the super-rich all have in common is a lack of taste. I choose my words with care. It is not so much that they are in crashingly ‘bad taste’. Bad taste is at least ‘taste’ of some sort, and can be expressive of personality. These owners do not actually have taste, as such, at all. These places are not homes, they are exercises in self-promotion and self-advertisement. Whereas you and I, when deciding how to decorate our rooms, will express certain aspects of our personalities, the super-rich compulsively want to advertise the size of their bank accounts. Vulgar: A.N. Wilson describes the cinema as 'hideously impersonal' Such people have seldom spent much of their lives making friends — they are too busy making money — so they will not model their newly acquired houses on those of anyone they have known. Once they have enough, they show off by luxuriating in the most expensive hotels. Their houses reflect this: they live in homes that seem to be modelled on them and are as soulless as only a luxury hotel can be. There is actually something terribly sad about Heath Hall, and houses like it. Not one inch of its huge square footage has been chosen because it is home-like. Not one stick of the furniture belongs to the owner’s own past. In his scabrous diaries, the former Tory Defence minister Alan Clark quoted Chief Whip Michael Jopling on their Cabinet colleague and self-made millionaire Michael Heseltine. ‘The trouble with Michael,’ said Jopling, ‘is that he had to buy all his furniture.’ It was a comment that only a snob could have made — but there was some truth in it. Andreas Panayiotou will never be able to look across a shabby bit of carpet or battered chair owned by his grandmother, or see his father’s old clock ticking on the mantelpiece. Even the antiques will have been bought as if they were brand-new. White room: One of the mansion's 14 bedrooms kitted out all in white furniture . How different from the rooms at Balmoral which we glimpsed on the recent programme about the Queen, where she unpretentiously kicked straight a two-bar electric fire and where there is a homely mix of family photographs in frames, old furniture and well-trodden tartan carpets. Of course, the mention of Balmoral will make some readers say that bad taste has always been with us. The last Liberal Prime Minister in Queen Victoria’s reign, Lord Rosebery, used to say that he thought the drawing room at Osborne — the Queen’s house on the Isle of Wight — was the ugliest room he had ever seen until he saw the drawing room at Balmoral. Lord Rosebery, who came from a world of ‘old money’, looked down his nose at these two newly built royal palaces. But if a snob like Rosebery sneered at the Queen’s taste, at least it was taste he was sneering at. Whereas the soulless houses of today’s mega-rich are tasteless in every sense of the word.","Heath Hall had been put on the market for £100m in 2011 .

"By . Eleanor Harding . UPDATED: . 15:58 EST, 22 July 2011 . IT has often been voted the nation’s favourite dish. But it seems our taste for chicken tikka masala may be cooling. Research shows the orange-tinged curry has been usurped by a lesser-known pretender, the jalfrezi. A far hotter dish, cooked using green chillis, it is now the most popular dish in Britain’s 10,000 Indian restaurants, the survey found. Currying favour: The jalfrezi has been confirmed as Britain's new favourite curry . It is thought Britons are becoming . more adventurous in their tastes, with restaurant diners developing a . much higher tolerance to hot foods. Coming in at second place was the madras, another spicy dish containing generous helpings  of chilli. Chicken tikka masala made it into only eighth place in the poll by Chaat!, the in-house magazine of the British Curry Club. Among the 1,000 people polled, jalfrezi took 21 per cent of the vote and madras 18 per cent. Moving down: The traditionally favoured masala could only manage eighth in the poll of more than 1,000 curry-lovers . Just over 10 per cent voted for rogan josh, a medium-spiced dish, while korma, a creamy, milder dish, was chosen by 2 per cent. The poll found six million Britons a day visit curry houses. Enam Ali, owner of Le Raj restaurant in Epsom, Surrey, and founder of the British Curry Awards, said Britons are getting more used to spicy dishes. He said: ‘Once you have a flavour of spice on your palate, it’s very difficult to go back to having something plain. 'The British palate is changing. People’s tolerance for spiciness has gone up, and they are beginning to appreciate it more. ‘London is now the best place for a curry, even better than India. All the top chefs are here now.’ Dave Jenkins, editor-in-chief of Chaat!, said: ‘It’s great to see that people are becoming more adventurous rather than going for the safer dishes such as korma. ‘People are after more exciting dishes and flavours these days. Curry is now so ingrained into our culture, it’s no longer a novelty dish. 'People are becoming more savvy with what’s on offer, and we have so many choices right now. Chicken tikka masala was never going to stay at the top for ever.’ Chicken tikka masala is said to have been invented in a Glasgow curry house when a customer said his chicken was too dry. Scrabbling about in the kitchen, the chef hit upon the idea of preparing a sauce by putting spices into a tin of Campbell’s condensed tomato soup. Serves 4 . INGREDIENTS . METHOD . Chop the onion, garlic, chillis and peppers, and saute in a glug of olive oil until the onions turn translucent. Add the ground coriander, cumin and turmeric and stir to coat the vegetables.

Add the . tin of tomatoes and chicken stock and cook for 20 minutes, until the . chickenis cooked and the sauce has reduced and thickened. Add the salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Stir in the fresh coriander to wilt before serving. Garnish with a couple of coriander leaves, and serve with boiled basmati rice and naan bread.",Masala only manages eighth in British curry poll .

Medical Center on Thursday following the death of a young research associate that was apparently caused by a dangerous bacteria that he had been handling. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that for the past several weeks, 25-year-old Richard Din, a biology major working with the Northern California Institute for Research and Education, had been researching the germ Neisseria meningitidis that can cause meningitis and bloodstream disease. A state laboratory has confirmed that . the rare strain that Din was studying -- Serotype B -- was the same one . found in his body, according to the website Military.com. Perfect match: A state laboratory has confirmed that the rare strain that Richard Din was studying -- Serotype B -- was the same one found in his body . According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the disease caused by this particular strain is relatively uncommon in the United States, with only about 1,000 cases reported each year. In 2010, an estimated 75 people died from this type of meningococcal infection. The germ causes septicemia and meningitis, officials . said. Septicemia is an inflammation of the bloodstream that causes . bleeding into the skin and organs, and is believed to be the cause of Din's death. What is meningococcal disease?An infection that can affect the blood, organs and the thin layer of tissue that covers the brain and spinal cord.What are the symptoms?They include high fever, headache, stiff neck, vomiting, rash, confusion and severe sleepiness.How is the disease spread?The disease is usually spread by contact with fluids from the nose and mouth of the infected person, most commonly by coughing, sneezing or kissing.Can it be prevented by vaccine?Yes, but the vaccines are not 100 per cent effective, and they do not protect against certain strains of the bacteria. It can be spread by sneezing, coughing or kissing. Meningitis is a bacterial infection of the thin layer of tissue surrounding the . brain and spinal cord that can result in brain damage and death. A VA official told the San Francisco Chronicle that Din, who shared an apartment with his girlfriend and several roommates in treasure Island, left work on Friday at 5pm in good health. Two hours later, the researcher told his girlfriend that he was feeling ill with a headache, fever . and chills, and went to bed. Din woke up Saturday morning to discover a rash all over his body and asked his friends to take him to the VA hospital. On the way there, the 25-year-old fell unconscious in the car . and had no pulse on arrival. He was pronounced dead of multiple organ failure at around 2pm, according to Reuters. 'In his case, the time between the onset of symptoms and death was 17 hours. That's not uncommon with this disease,' Dr Harry Lampiris, chief of infectious disease at the San Francisco VA, told the Chronicle. While vaccination can generally . prevent meningococcal disease, the vaccine is not effective against this . particular strain of bacteria. Lampiris said Din had not been . vaccinated, but as a precaution, all of his co-workers and close friends . have since received the inoculation. About 70 VA employees who came in contact with Din also have been given antibiotics to prevent possible infection. The University of California at Berkeley graduate had been . described as a polite and intelligent man whose interest in infectious . disease was inspired by a family tragedy, according to former classmate . Alex Peng. Silent killer: The germ that Richard Din had been studying is known to cause inflammation of the bloodstream and meningitis . 'It really troubles me thinking about . it,' Peng told the San Jose Mercury News. 'It's really sad to hear about him . passing away after he wanted to follow that dream.' The 25-year-old's death is being . investigated by the VA, the California Occupational Safety and Health . Administration, the state Department of Public Health and the San . Francisco Department of Public Health. Officials have six months to . conclude the probe into Din's death, and if any workplace violations are found, the employer could face citations and fines, according to the San Francisco Examiner. Lampiris says he is not sure how Din contracted the infection, given that his colleagues have described him as a very 'fastidious' and by-the-book researcher who had always followed safety procedures. Initial results . of the investigation did not show any spills or equipment failure that . could have caused the exposure. Fastidious: Din's co-workers at the Northern California Institute for Research and Education have described him as professional and 'fastidious' in his work . Lampiris said he does not believe the case poses a high risk because the incubation period is generally three to five days. Symptoms of meningococcal disease can include high fever, headache, stiff neck, vomiting, rash, confusion and severe sleepiness. All local hospitals have been put on alert to watch out for anyone . coming in with these symptoms and to immediately contact public health officials, CBS San Francisco has reported. According to a 2005 study . by the Journal of Clinical Microbiology cited by Military.com, 16 laboratory workers worldwide contracted meningitis between 1985 . and 2001, including six in the US.

David Cameron is considering a temporary withdrawal from the European human rights convention in order to finally remove Abu Qatada from Britain. The Prime Minister held a ‘council of war’ with senior ministers yesterday to find a way of deporting the hate preacher to his native Jordan to face terror charges, according to sources. Home Secretary Theresa May, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling and Attorney General Dominic Grieve were summoned for talks at Downing Street shortly before the Government discovered it had lost the latest round in an interminable legal battle to remove the terror suspect. David Cameron is considering a temporary withdrawal from the European human rights convention in order to finally remove Abu Qatada from Britain . Remaining in Britain? Abu Qatada has won the latest court case today in his long running legal battle to avoid deportation . Sources said Mr Cameron had declared . Qatada’s continued presence in Britain ‘intolerable’ and insisted even . the most controversial options must be considered. It is understood that one possibility is Britain . temporarily leaving the European Convention of Human Rights – a move . which would infuriate the Liberal Democrats and push the Coalition to . breaking point. Appeal: Theresa May had hoped to take the case against Qatada to the Supreme Court . Today the Prime Minister's officials spokesman refused to rule out the option of temproairily withdrawing from the ECHR. He told journalsists: 'The Government . will explore every option in seeking to deport this dangerous . individual and that's what we are going to keep doing. 'The Prime Minister met with the Home . Secretary, the Justice Secretary and the Attorney General yesterday to . discuss the case, I'm not going to get into specifics as to what the . Government is considering, as I say, we are going to explore every . option.' European judges have ruled that Qatada . would not receive a fair trial in Jordan but Conservative MPs have . suggested that the threat of Britain pulling out of the convention would . persuade Strasbourg to back down. The Prime Minister’s decision to put . himself at the head of Government efforts to remove Qatada is high risk, . since he will now be blamed if they fail. Mrs May is expected to announce new . developments in negotiations with Jordan over his deportation when she . makes an emergency statement to the Commons today. Ministers have been trying for a . decade to send Qatada to Jordan, where he is accused of plotting a . terrorist atrocity to coincide with the Millennium. His removal was originally approved by the British courts, only to be halted by the European Court of Human Rights last year. Judges in Strasbourg said he would not . get a fair trial because some of the evidence used against him may have . been obtained by torture. Controversially, Mrs May opted not to appeal . against this verdict. Instead, she and her ministers secured . personal promises from the Jordanian authorities there would be no use . of torture evidence, and began the deportation process again in the UK . legal system. But last November, the Special . Immigration Appeals Commission said it was not satisfied with the . assurances, and halted Qatada’s removal. The court said it must reflect . the Strasbourg ruling. That decision was last month upheld by . the Appeal Court and yesterday the same court refused permission for . the Home Secretary to challenge the ruling in the Supreme Court. The . Government is to persist with its bid by applying directly to the . Supreme Court for permission. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘The . Government remains committed to deporting this dangerous man and we . continue to work with the Jordanians to address the outstanding legal . issues preventing deportation.’ Still smiling: Labour and Conservative ministers have been trying to deport Qatada for a decade but have failed . In her statement to MPs today, Mrs May . will announce new developments in negotiations with Jordan over . deporting Qatada. Home Office minister James Brokenshire is understood . to have visited the country to secure fresh assurances that the preacher . will be treated fairly. However, any new agreement would undoubtedly be subject to fresh appeals by Qatada. At best, it would restart the legal . merry-go-round, with the case going back through the British courts – . and even returning to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. That could allow Qatada to remain in Britain for many years at taxpayers’ expense. Qatada – who has been linked to a long . list of international terrorists – is currently in Belmarsh . high-security jail for allegedly breaching his immigration bail . conditions. It is feared the longer the case drags on the less willing . judges will be to insist Qatada remains in prison and the more likely it . is that he will be allowed back out on to the streets. Esher and Walton MP Dominic Raab, a . former human rights lawyer, said: ‘The last government made a major . mistake in not deporting Qatada in 2009, when the UK Law Lords gave the . green light. ‘Qatada has been running rings around . the British justice system ever since. This case shows we urgently need . to overhaul the law on deportation, scrap the Human Rights Act and start . standing up for British democracy rather than kow-towing to the . European Court in Strasbourg.’ Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper . said after today’s decision was announced: ‘A year ago, Theresa May . promised Abu Qatada would soon be on a plane. ‘Now it is clear her legal strategy . has completely failed. The Home Secretary must tell us urgently what she . is going to do now to get Abu Qatada deported or tried, and keep him . off our streets.’ September 16 1993 - The Jordanian father of five claims asylum when he arrives in Britain on a forged passport.June 1994 - He is allowed to stay in Britain.March 1995 - Qatada issues a 'fatwa' justifying the killing of converts from Islam, their wives and children in Algeria.May 1998 - He applies for indefinite leave to remain in Britain.April 1999 - He is convicted in his absence on terror charges in Jordan and sentenced to life imprisonment.October 1999 - The radical cleric speaks in London advocating the killing of Jews and praising attacks on Americans.February 2001 . - He is arrested by anti-terror police over involvement in a plot to . bomb Strasbourg Christmas market.

"By . Rachel Quigley . PUBLISHED: . 11:01 EST, 30 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:45 EST, 30 August 2013 . He has stared death in the face and come out the other side to tell his story - so swallowing an amputated human toe should be child's play. The man who paid $500 for the privilege of gulping down a pickled toe was today named as Joshua Clark, who is believed to be a Hurricane Katrina survivor from New Orleans. Reports emerged on Wednesday about the incident, which took place at the Downtown Hotel in Dawson City, Canada, on Saturday night. Clark decided to take on the area's infamous Sourtoe Cocktail Challenge - wherein an amputated toe, which has been . preserved and pickled, is dropped into a glass and for $5 the customer must . drink the shot and have the toe touch their lips. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Josh Clark listens to the rules of the Sourtoe Challenge: 'You can drink it fast, you can drink it slow. But the lips have gotta touch the toe' Down in one: Josh tilts his head back to ensure the entire contents of the glass - toe and all - disappear . Saloon: The Downtown Hotel in Dawson City, Yukon Territory, is famous for its Sourtoe Cocktail - a 40-year tradition which has been done by more than 65,000 people . But Clark went one step further and . drank the toe down with his whiskey, then threw $500 on the table - the . fine imposed by the saloon should anyone swallow it. The idea of the Sourtoe Cocktail started in September 1973, when riverboat captain Dick Stevenson found a severed big toe preserved in a pickle jar. Captain Dick somehow got the idea of making a game with it and came up with the original rules for the drink over the course of a drunken evening with friends - Take a beer glass full of champagne, drop in the toe, tip the glass back…and the toe must touch the lips. In September 1973, eight people participated in the first attempt; nearly four decades later, the Sourtoe Cocktail Club has an estimated 100,000-plus members. Any liquor can be used in the cocktail, but the norm now is a shot of Yukon Jack whiskey. It costs just $5 and for that you sign a log book and get a certificate confirming you as a member of the Sourtoe Cocktail Club. One rule must be adhered to however: 'You can drink it fast, you can drink it . slow. But the lips have gotta touch the toe.' It has been described by members of the club as a 'leathery piece of jerky with a toe nail attached'. Clark was said to have been in Yukon Territory for the summer and had just got his rent deposit back. A video of the incident emerged today on CBC Yukon . and shows the toe-curling moment the pinkie disappeared from the glass. Clark's eyes widen as it goes down his throat before he washes it down with . another drink. He then stands up, raises his arms in . the air in triumph and says, 'I did it, it's down', before throwing . $500 on the table to a visibly shocked Terry Lee, the 'Toe Captain' of . the night. Lee said the latest toe was 'mummified' with salt, and plonked into drinks for brave patrons about 30 to 40 times per night. Speaking to The Star about what happened, he said: 'This guy popped it in his mouth, takes $500 out of his pocket and slams it on the table and starts walking away. 'I said, ""Where’s the toe?"" and he said, ""I swallowed it"". I was shocked.' The fine has since been raised to $2,500. Throughout the 40-year tradition, more than 100,000 people have joined the Sourtoe Cocktail club. The Sour Toe started in September 1973 . when a local eccentric named Captain Dick Stevenson found a severed toe . preserved in a jar. He came up with the original rules . for the drink over the course of a drunken evening with friends: take a . beer glass full of champagne, drop in the toe, tip the glass back. Since then a number have been swallowed, lost or . destroyed - eight in total - but fortunately for the bar, they always manage to find . someone to donate a new toe. Lee said they have a backup toe but like to keep two at a time so are on the hunt looking for a new one. He told CBC: 'We like to have two toes - . we switch them off once a week - and now we can't do that. We need . toes. We're putting it out there, if you have a spare toe, hey we need . one.' Josh Clark remained in New Orleans during Hurricane . Katrina and the collapse of the levees. He refused to leave the city at the dangerous and devastating time and tape-recorded impressionistic . interviews with fellow storm survivors. From these interviews and his own diary entries, he penned Heart Like Water: Surviving Katrina and Life in its Disaster Zone, which was a 2007 finalist for the National Book Critics Circle award. Gnarly: While it may sound unsanitary, the toes are pickled for months in medical alcohol and then packed in dry salts so pose no health risks to drinkers . New member: A female customer prepares to take the Sourtoe challenge so she can join the prestigious club . Down in one: The famous tradition is mentioned in guide books and people have come from far and wide to become members of the Sourtoe Cocktail Club . Terry Lee said they are now looking for more toes: 'We like to have two toes - we switch them off once a week - and now we can't do that. We need toes. We're putting it out there, if you have a spare toe, hey we need one' Captain Dick shows how it's done: The now-83-year-old says the Sourtoe Cocktail is his greatest and proudest achievement . The toe is believed to belong to Steve White, a chain-link fence installer in . Whitehorse, who got his pinkie toe amputated in January 2000 after . developing hammertoe. He kept it in a jar in his freezer and donated it in April 2002. Manager at the Downtown Hotel Dick Van Nostrand told the Wall Street Journal last year: 'We've had people throwing up, we've had . people gagging on their drinks. 'Real trouble is when someone gets . overenthusiastic. You never know when some fool is going to do . something stupid. And then we'll be without a . toe.'","The 40-year tradition was started by Captain Dick after he found a severed toe in a jar .

The latest residents of the International Space Station have arrived safety after blasting off on a Russian rocket. A Soyuz capsule carrying American, Russian and Italian astronauts successfully docked with the International Space Station this morning, where the new crew will spend six months carrying out a variety of experiments. The docking took place at 2:10 am - less than six hours after the Russian spacecraft lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, which Russia leases in Kazakhstan. Scroll down for video . In this image taken from video provided by NASA, the Soyuz TMA-09M carrying three new Expedition 36 crew members approaches the International Space Station on Wednesday morning.

This photo from NASA shows the Soyuz rocket on Expedition 36/37 carrying Soyuz Commander Fyodor Yurchikhin of the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos). Flight Engineers Luca Parmitano of the European Space Agency and Karen Nyberg of NASA, were also onboard as the capsule launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan to the International Space Station. Yurchikhin, Nyberg, and, Parmitano, will remain aboard the station until mid-November .

Major Peake is the only Briton ever to be accepted into the European Astronaut Corps. His mission will make him the first UK national to travel and work in space, under the Union Jack, on a British Government-funded mission. Other British astronauts have either secured private funding – such as Helen Sharman, who flew on a Russian rocket in 1991 – or taken dual citizenship, such as Michael Foale and Piers Sellers, who flew missions on the US space shuttle.

A Canadian mathematician believes only frequent coordinated attacks against the living dead can save the human race. A mathematical calculation by a professor at the University of Ottawa - (bN)(S/N)Z = bSZ  - describes the rate that humans would become zombies as they are gradually infected by the living dead. The maths might seem bizarre, but it can be used to model the spread of disease in the modern world. Robert . J. Smith is publishing his zombie maths models and others created by researchers in a forthcoming book called 'Mathematical modelling of zombies,' NBC News reported. His calculations show why zombies are the viruses of the monster world. While Dr Smith chose a tongue-and-cheek scenario, the maths is important as zombies' likeness to the way viruses spread in the real world makes them interesting subjects for theoretical analyses of virus epidemics. In his zombie apocalypse equation - (bN)(S/N)Z = bSZ - where N represents the total population, S is the number of people susceptible to zombie attacks, Z is the number of zombies and b is the likelihood of transmission, the model shows that people would quickly become zombies. It also demonstrates that the living dead would efficiently take over the world as there is no possibility of 'stable equilibrium' where zombies and humans could peacefully co-exist or overcome the zombie infection. The mathematicians told NBC that only coordinated attacks to eradicate early zombies could save humanity. Disease modelling, like Dr Smith's research, plays an important role in preparing for and fighting viral epidemics. Dr Smith's maths is important as zombies' likeness to the way viruses spread in the real world makes them interesting subjects for theoretical analyses of virus epidemics. Zombies from Shaun of the Dead are pictured . Mat Mogk, founder of the Zombie Research Society, told NBC that as zombies are biological in nature and do not live forever, mathematicians can apply biological models to them. They are often depicted as flesh-eating monsters who spread their disease by munching on healthy people . Virologist Ian MacKay of the Australian Infectious Diseases Research Centre at the . University of Queensland blogged about new film World War Z, in which Brad Pitt plays a UN inspector scouring Earth for the origin of a zombie outbreak. He said: 'A . zombie is a bit like giving a virus legs and teeth. 'This is basically a virus taking over a host, and . spreading very quickly and efficiently...It's an extreme . virus-transmission event, if you like.' Virologist Ian MacKay talked about zombies in film World War Z starring Brad Pitt (pictured). He said zombies are 'a virus taking over a host and spreading very quickly and efficiently' Dr Smith believes the rapidity of infection in zombie infections (depicted in films) makes the spread of disease unstoppable as 'it only takes one zombie to overtake a city'. He believes quarantine or slowing the spread of the disease down only delays the zombie apocalypse, instead of stopping it completely. Only very frequent attacks that increase in their effectiveness could save humanity, he said. To come up with his mathematical model, Dr Smith used a technique developed just two decades ago called 'impulsive differential equations' that demonstrates how sudden shocks affect systems and is often used to model satellite orbits. The zombie maths models have helped develop another working model for a real disease - human papillomavirus (HPV).","A Canadian mathematician has created a calculation to show the rate that humans would become zombies .

As a self-proclaimed ‘history nerd’, American popstar Kelly Clarkson was happy to pay more than £150,000 for a ring that once belonged to Jane Austen. But the 31-year-old singer has been told she cannot take the item out of Britain and back to her native Texas because it is a ‘national treasure’. Miss Clarkson, the first winner of talent show American Idol, saw off seven bidders in an auction at Sotheby’s last year for the gold and turquoise ring. Precious: The ring is one of only three surviving pieces of jewellery known to have belonged to Jane Austen . National treasure: Musician Kelly Clarkson, pictured at the Annual Academy of Country Music Awards in Las Vegas earlier this year, has been told she can't take the ring out of the UK . Still in its original box, it was sold for £152,450 despite being expected to fetch only £30,000. But when she applied for an export licence, a reviewing committee recommended that the ring should be kept in the UK. Culture Secretary Ed Vaizey has placed a temporary export bar on the item in the hope a UK buyer can be found to purchase it. He said: ‘Jane Austen’s modest lifestyle and her early death mean that objects associated with her of any kind are extremely rare, so I hope this simple but elegant ring can be saved for the nation.’ If no British bidder comes forward the Government will not be able to refuse an export licence. But Miss Clarkson has indicated she will be willing to sell the piece of jewellery if an offer matching hers is made. The export licensing decision will be deferred until September 30 and can be delayed until December 30 if proof emerges of a ‘serious’ UK buyer. Miss Clarkson encountered a similar problem when she bought a first edition of Jane Austen’s novel Persuasion, saying last year: ‘We put in an export request but I can’t take it out of the UK as they’ve named it a national treasure.’ After the author’s death in 1817, aged 41, the ring was given to her older sister Cassandra and kept in the family until it was sold at the auction in London last July. The ring is one of three surviving pieces of jewellery known to have belonged to the Pride and Prejudice author . The Government took the extraordinary step of putting an export bar on a classic £5million Bentley dubbed the 'Concorde of its day' to stop it leaving the country. This 1929 four litre supercharged Bentley ‘Blower’ is regarded as one of the most significant cars in British motorsport history. Its current owner forked out a world record £5,042,000 for the motor car at Bonhams’ Goodwood Festival of Speed auction last year. Classic: The government has put an export bar on the £5million Bentley dubbed the Concorde of its day . He has now decided to permanently export the single-seater car. However, because the Bentley has been recognised as a 'national treasure' by authorities culture secretary Ed Vaizey has temporarily banned its export in the hope of finding a buyer. Any interested parties would need to spend an agreed price of £5,149,800 for the car, which was raced by motorsport icon Sir Henry ‘Tim’ Birkin. Birkin, a former fighter pilot, was one of the most famous of the Bentley Boys - a group of wealthy men who raced the British sports cars in the 1920s and 30s.

His life was cut short in 1933 in a freak accident after he burned himself on an exhaust pipe during a race. The burn became infected and he died from septicaemia at the age of 36. His iconic Bentley was later bought by the horologist George Daniels, who owned it until his death in 2011. The classic Bentley which was raced by motorsport icon Sir Henry 'Tim' Birkin (pictured) Culture Minister Ed Vaizey yesterday made the decision to defer granting an export licence following a recommendation by the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest. It was agreed with Arts Council England that the Bentley 'was of outstanding significance for the study of motor racing and automobile technology in the first half of the twentieth century'. The decision on the export licence application for the car will be deferred for a period ending on October 31, 2013. This period may be extended until May 31, 2014 inclusive if a serious intention to raise funds to purchase the car is made at the recommended price.","The singer bought the jewellery at auction last year .

Bottles of Tylenol sold in the US will soon bear red warnings alerting users to the potentially fatal risks of taking too much of the popular pain reliever.The unusual step, disclosed by the company that makes Tylenol, comes amid a growing number of lawsuits and pressure from the federal government that could have widespread ramifications for a medicine taken by millions of people every day.Johnson & Johnson says the warning will appear on the cap of new bottles of Extra Strength Tylenol sold in the US starting in October and on most other Tylenol bottles in coming months. Scroll down for video. Starting in October Extra Strength Tylenol bottles will have a new warning label on the cap alerting users to potentially fatal risks of taking too much of the pain reliever . The warning will make it explicitly clear that the over-the-counter drug contains acetaminophen, a pain-relieving ingredient that's the nation's leading cause of sudden liver failure. The warning will alert consumers to the presence of acetaminophen in the drug, which is taken in high quantities can lead to liver failure . Acetaminophen can be found in more than 600 common over-the-counter and prescription products used by nearly one in four American adults every week, including household brands like Nyquil cold formula, Excedrin pain tablets and Sudafed sinus pills. Tylenol is the first of these products to include such a warning label on the bottle cap. McNeil says the warning is a result of research into the misuse of Tylenol by consumers. The new cap message will read, 'CONTAINS ACETAMINOPHEN' and 'ALWAYS READ THE LABEL.'The move comes at a critical time for the company, which faces more than 85 personal injury lawsuits in federal court that blame Tylenol for liver injuries and deaths. At the same time, the Food and Drug . Administration is drafting long-awaited safety proposals that could . curtail the use of Tylenol and other acetaminophen products. Advocates for the warning believe the Americans use the pain reliever too casually without really known what it contains . Much is at stake for McNeil and its parent company. Johnson & Johnson does not report sales of Tylenol, but total sales of all over-the-counter medicines containing acetaminophen were more than $1.75 billion last year, according to Information Resources Inc., a retail data service. Safety experts are most concerned about 'extra-strength' versions of Tylenol and other pain relievers with acetaminophen found in drugstores. A typical two-pill dose of Extra Strength Tylenol contains 1,000 milligrams of acetaminophen, compared with 650 milligrams for regular strength. Extra Strength Tylenol is so popular that some pharmacies don't even stock regular strength. Most experts agree that acetaminophen is safe when used as directed, which generally means taking 4,000 milligrams, or eight pills of Extra Strength Tylenol or less, a day. Each year, some 100 million Americans use acetaminophen, but liver damage occurs in only a fraction of 1 percent of users. Currently the warning about the acetaminophen dosage in extra strength Tylenol is just on the back of the pill bottles . Still, liver specialists say those cases are preventable. They say that part of the problem is that there are sometimes hundreds of pills in a bottle, making it easy for consumers to pop as many as they please. For example, McNeil sells Extra Strength Tylenol in bottles containing up to 325 tablets . 'The argument goes that if you take acetaminophen correctly you will virtually never get into trouble,' said Dr. William Lee of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, who has studied acetaminophen toxicity for four decades. 'But it's the very fact that it's easily accessible over-the-counter in bottles of 300 pills or more that puts people in harm's way.' Overdoses from acetaminophen send 55,000 to 80,000 people to the emergency room according the FDA . Lee applauded the new warning, but said McNeil's marketing has contributed to the 'freewheeling' way that Americans take the drug. For decades, McNeil has advertised Tylenol as 'the safest kind of pain reliever' when used as directed. 'That has been their standard ploy in the past, and I would argue that safest it is not,' he says.McNeil's Kuffner stands by the company's safety claim: 'When taken as directed, when people read and follow the label, I believe that Tylenol and the acetaminophen ingredient is one of the safest pain relievers on the market.'McNeil is the only major drug maker adopting the bottle cap warning at this time, according to the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, a trade group for over-the-counter medicine companies.'While this is not an industry-wide initiative at this time, it fits squarely within the many ongoing industry-wide educational initiatives to further acetaminophen safe and responsible use by consumers,' said Emily Skor, a Vice President with the trade group, which represents McNeil, Bayer Healthcare, Procter & Gamble and other nonprescription drug makers.","In October Johnson & Johnson will put warnings on the top of Tylenol bottles alerting consumers to the presence of acetaminophen .
Acetaminophen, a pain relieving ingredient, is one of the leading causes of liver failure in the country .
Drug makers hope that the warning will stop consumers from accidentally overdosing on the household pain reliever ."

Perfect storm: Sam Harper Brighouse died following a reaction to Ibuprofen and sports supplements during the Brighton Marathon . A fit and healthy young man died following a ‘perfect storm’ reaction to sports supplements and Ibuprofen during a marathon. Former public schoolboy Sam Harper Brighouse fell ill about 16 miles into the Brighton Marathon on April 14. From that point, a coroner said 'there was nothing that could have been done to save him'. The biology graduate from London, described as being ‘fit as a fiddle’, died of bowel ischaemia and a gastro-intestinal haemorrhage. Bowel ischaemia can lead to a 75 per cent loss of blood flow to the bowel. The 23-year-old had taken two or four Ibuprofen tablets during the race, as well as sports supplements, but his preparation was described as 'entirely sensible'. At an inquest into his death, Brighton and Hove Coroner Veronica Hamilton-Deeley said the combination of circumstances 'have never been recorded before'. The cause of death was contributed to . by an ‘idiosyncratic reaction’ to hyperthermia, dehydration, endurance . exertion, hyperosmolar sports supplements and ibuprofen, and his potassium levels were three times higher than normal levels. The inquest heard that he also used an inhaler for asthma but the coroner ruled that this did not contribute to his death. Describing his body’s reaction, Ms Hamilton-Deeley said it was a ‘perfect storm’ situation. ‘From the point of his collapse there was nothing that could have been done to help Sam,' she said. ‘There is no evidence that any other death has occurred in the same circumstances as Sam’s did.’ Popular: Mr Harper Brighouse was raising cash for charity by running the Brighton marathon, one of Britain's largest races . Recording . a verdict of misadventure, she added: ‘Sam died as a result of a . combination of complications arising on a background of endurance sport. 'This combination has never been recorded before and may never be recorded again.' ‘Sam . was unique in life and he remains unique in his death. His intent was . to undertake to run the Brighton Marathon and prepared entirely . sensibly. Fit as a fiddle: The 23-year-old's death was described by the coroner as unique. The young man did not 'indulge in risky behaviour' 'He didn’t indulge in any risky behaviour. The products he used to support him were recognised and recommended. ‘Everything . that Sam did was entirely appropriate and yet events took an unexpected . and unintended turn which led to his death. This is a definition of . misadventure.’ Mr Brighouse was an ex-pupil of the £15,800-a-year Alleyn’s School, in Dulwich, South East London, and later studied at Sheffield University. He had been participating in the marathon to raise money for a charity supporting Aids orphans. Speaking . after the inquest, Mr Harper Brighouse’s family called on marathon . runners to be careful when taking sports supplements. His . uncle Robert Brighouse said: 'We would like to thank all the people who . attended to Sam after he collapsed. He was cared for by extraordinarily . kind, compassionate people who could not have done more or tried harder . to keep him alive. 'Sam’s . death was described by the coroner as extraordinarily rare, but it is a . tragic reminder that participation in any endurance event and taking . gels and analgesics to help you get through it carry a level of risk, no . matter how fit you are or how hard you train. 'The . endurance sports industry is still relatively new and we are all still . learning about how the body copes and reacts to what we put it through . and feed it. 'We would urge . all those involved in the industry to do what they can to ensure that . everyone who participates does so knowing what they need to do and take . to make the experience unforgettable for all the right reasons.'","Coroner rules Sam Harper Brighouse suffered a 'perfect storm' reaction .

He's been ranked as high as No. 7, and reached the semifinals at his home major, the French Open, in 2008. But he also has been slowed by injuries, and skipped Wimbledon this year. Monfils did not disappoint yesterday, sliding into the splits while chasing some balls, holding his arms wide apart and nodding after one particularly skillful shot, and even pointing out a man in the stands who was chastised by the chair umpire for using a flash while taking photos. 'He gets the crowd involved,' Isner said. 'If you purchase a ticket to watch him play, you're not going to go home disappointed. That's just how it is.' The 6ft 10in Isner, born in North Carolina and based in Florida, is hardly the most well-known or accomplished U.S. tennis player, but he is probably the host country's best chance for a deep run this year. Up against the crowd: Despite the cheers for his opponent, Isner signals that he is one point from victory . Mutual respect: Isner eventually pulled out a 7-5, 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (4) victory at the at Louis Armstrong Stadium . Popular: Gael Monfils responds to the cheers of the crowd as he walks off the court after his defeat . Especially after the next-highest U.S. man, 26th-seeded Sam Querrey, lost earlier Thursday to Adrian Mannarino of France 7-6 (4), 7-6 (5), 6-7 (5), 6-4. Now Isner will face No. 22 Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany, the player he lost to in the third round last year. 'I'm going to get some revenge on him,' said Isner, whose best showing at any Grand Slam tournament was when he was a quarterfinalist at the 2011 U.S. Open. What he is most famous for, of course, is winning the longest match in tennis history, an 11-hour, five-minute marathon that stretched over three days at Wimbledon three years ago before ending at 70-68 in the fifth set. One thing Isner does rather well is win tiebreakers, thanks in large part to his booming serve, and that was how this match was decided. Monfils was ahead 4-3 in the fourth-set tiebreaker, but Isner took the last four points. He hit a 135mph service winner, then a 139mph ace - his 23rd of the match - to make it 5-4. An inside-out forehand winner put Isner up 6-4, earning a match point, and he gestured to the fans to show him some love. They did, screaming, 'U-S-A! U-S-A!' Isner - whose right hip was bothering him and was treated by a trainer early in the fourth set - ended it there, hitting a crisp volley that Monfils got to, but could only put into the net. Isner chucked his racket and then pantomimed the same sort of 'Superman'-inspired move that Cam Newton - the quarterback for Isner's favorite NFL team, the Carolina Panthers - uses to celebrate touchdowns. 'I ... knew that against Gael, the atmosphere was going to be electric,' Isner said, 'and that's what it was.'","Flushing Meadows spectators clapped and chanted for Gael Monfils .

The 1,920 cans were mislabeled as Swanson 100% Natural Chicken Broth, though they actually contained pasta and meatballs. Campbell's Soup recalled 80 cases of Swanson's 100% Natural Chicken Broth after it was discovered that they actually contained SpaghettiOs . The company pulled the products as soon as consumers started to report the mistake. 'In an abundance of caution, Campbell is retrieving the 80 cases of . canned pasta labeled as Swanson 100% Natural Chicken Broth from the . market,' the company published on its website. 'This recall does not affect . any other Campbell products.' The total amount of food recalled amounts to 1,740 pounds of pasta and meat, NBC News reported. Aside from consumers not getting what they purchased, the mislabeled cans pose a potential health threat to the uniformed buyers. Unlike the pasta with chicken brother, SpaghettiOs with meatballs contain allergens such as wheat, milk, and soy, The Huffington Post reported. Consumers were dismayed to find SpaghettiOs in what they thought were cans of chicken broth. The mislabeled cans contained allergens including wheat, milk, and soy . The mislabeled food was made in Paris, Texas and then shipped to distribution center that ships the product around the country, according to the website. Amongst the states with mislabeled cans are Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. Though two consumers reported this mistake before Campbell's Soup publicly recalled the cans, according to the Department of Agriculture, the company has not gotten any reports of consumers suffering an allergic reaction, NBC News reported. Campbell's Soup has asked that any consumers who do receive these mislabeled cans return them to stores for a full refund, according to The Huffington Post. News of this mishap came right after the company's stock closed at $43.19 at the end of the week.

A mother and daughter have pleaded guilty to bilking hundreds of lonely women around the world out of over $1million. Karen Vasseur, 63, and daughter Tracy Vasseur, 42, pleaded guilty to posing as US soldiers in a Nigerian-style internet romance scam where they stole $1.1million from 374 victims in the States and 40 other countries, Colorado Attorney General John Suthers announced Wednesday. The greedy family matriarch is also alleged to have tried to steal an inheritance from her own children. The elder Vasseur received a 15-year prison sentence for the scam, daughter Karen was given a 12-year sentence, Mr Suthers said. Depraved duo: Karen Vasseur, 63, and daughter Tracy Vasseur, 42 pleaded guilty to charges this week . ‘Not only did this mother-daughter duo break the law, they broke hearts worldwide,’ said Mr Suthers, ‘it is fitting that they received stiff sentences for their unconscionable crimes committed in the name of love and the United States military.’ The despicable duo copped to seeking lonely women on dating websites and posing as military members looking for relationships, according to Mr Suthers. Once the con artists gained the womens’ trust, they would claim they had inherited millions of dollars and would be able to provide unsecured loans for an origination fee, Mr Suthers said. This ruse generated well over $1million dollars, of which the women kept about 10 per cent and funnelled the rest to Nigeria through a web of almost 20 different bank accounts across 11 banks, according to the Denver Post. Heartbroken: Victims of the Vasseurs even set up a Facebook group trying warn other women of the scam . Karen Vasseur even convinced her minor daughter to send and receive wires containing the ill-gotten money, the Post said. The two heartbreakers ‘never provided the loans, yet kept thousands of dollars in payments,’ said Mr Suthers. Restitution will be determined at a later date, he added. In an even weirder turn of events, Karen Vasseur even tried stealing an inheritance from her own children. While free on bond during trial for the Nigerian dating scam, the greedy granny ‘related to trying to gain control over her children’s inheritance and for attempting to influence a public servant,’ according to Mr Suthers. An additional four years was tacked on to her sentence, for a total of 19 years to be served consecutively.","The two women conned hundreds of women in over 40 countries .

A cyclist who had his front teeth shattered after an attack by teenagers while riding through Portland, Oregon will soon be speaking clearly again thanks to a generous dentist. Andy Sweeney, 20, was intentionally struck with a traffic cone last weekend and a photo of his cracked-tooth grin quickly went viral. Instead of being an embarrassment, the photo became the key to fixing his smile after a fundraising effort and a kindly dentist came to his aid. Ouch: Just a month after he moved to Portland, Andy Sweeney, 20, was smashed in the face with a traffic cone by teens as he rode his bike . ‘Some kids threw a traffic cone at me while I was riding my bike down MLK,’ Sweeney wrote next to the aftermath photo in a Reddit post. ‘Any other sh***y areas I should avoid?’ Two of the recent Illinois transplant’s front teeth were almost completely missing after the unprovoked attack just a month after his move to Portland. ‘I was coming up on these three kids,’ he told Oregon Live, ‘and they just threw a traffic cone at me. It hit me square in the teeth.’ The impact left him missing most of two of his front teeth. 'Square in the teeth': Sweeney moved to Portland form Illinois a month ago. He says he has no idea what motivated the attack that left him in terrible pain . Kindness of strangers: Local news editor Tim Oberlander started an online fund for Sweeney and it quickly raised over $1,500 . ‘It's crazy,’ Sweeney told KGW. ‘I don't really understand their motivation or what they were going for.’ He posted about the incident to Reddit and asked for advice about where else he should ride his bike and the photo he added started attracting attention. Tim Oberlander, a news editor at KGW, heard the Portland newcomer’s story and decided to do something about it. ‘I felt a little shameful that this happened to him in my town,’ Oberlander told the Oregonian. Sweeney used a credit card to get temporary caps put on his teeth after the pain became too much to bear but was told a permanent fix would cost something like $1,700, which he can’t afford on what he makes delivering sandwiches. Oberlander created a fundraiser on . group funding site gofundme.com and the donations to help Sweeney get . his teeth fixed poured in. As of Thursday, nearly $1,600 was raised and Sweeney was at a loss for words. Dis one: Sweeney shows off the temporary caps he paid for with a credit card. An area dentist and fellow cyclist has now come forward with an offer of free dental work . ‘I didn't really ask for it,’ he said. ‘I'm trying to see if I can maybe get things covered by my parents' dental insurance.’ But that won’t even be necessary. Portland, Oregon dentist Scott Edgar has offered to fix Sweeney’s teeth for free. A cyclist himself, Edgar felt obligated to help. ‘I felt bad that this happened to him in my part of town,’ he said. ‘I'm still not sure what I'm going to do about the money that has been donated,’ Sweeney said. ‘I didn't ask for that. I need to figure it out. But that doesn't mean I'm not grateful.’ Police continue to look into Sweeney’s assault, as well as other recent reports of assaults on cyclists in the area.","Andy Sweeney was smashed in the face with a traffic cone by two teens Saturday night .

The two lost kittens who shut down a portion of the New York City subway system Thursday after wandering onto the tracks should count their lucky stars that Joe Lhota is not the mayor yet. The former chairman of the Metropolitan Transit Authority and mayoral hopeful said he wouldn’t have stopped the subway as the kittens dubbed Arthur and August scrambled along the tracks. A spokesman for Lhota told the New York Post on Friday that the candidate doesn’t think stopping service for wayward cats is appropriate. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Snuggled up: Kittens Arthur (left) and August are pictured recuperating at an Animal Care and Control shelter after their harrowing ordeal . Looking ahead: Arthur and August, each weighing around 2lbs, will be vaccinated, transferred to a foster home and then put up for adoption in a couple of weeks . He said Lhota believes it should be the MTA’s call whether to shut down the line. On Thursday, power was cut on B and Q lines in Brooklyn for more than an hour as the two lost kitties scurried around the tracks. The tiny felines were finally rescued about seven hours later. Officials said Arthur and August, are being treated in a shelter. Lhota’s rivals in the mayoral race, among them Anthony Weiner, told the paper they would’ve stopped trains to save the pets. In fact, a spokesperson for the disgraced former congressman went even further, saying that the candidate would have risked his own life to rescue the helpless critters. 'If Anthony is elected mayor, he will not only stop trains for kittens, he will personally crawl over the third rail to do it,' Barbara Morgan told the Post. Sourpuss: New York Republican Mayoral . candidate Joe Lhota said that he would not have shut off subway service . to rescue the kittens . Furry rascals: August (left) and his buddy Arthur were saved after the pair ended up on the subway tracks, disrupting service on B and Q lines for two hours - a move that Lhota called 'inappropriate' Campaigning outside a subway stop Friday, Mr Weiner jokingly told the New York Daily News that if elected mayor, he would put in place a comprehensive subway kitten rescue policy. Other candidates also stated their position on the issue of whether or not to stop the trains for the kitties. Christine Quinn came out on the side of the furry felines, as did Bill Thompson's campaign. The aptly named John Catsimatidis deferred to the MTA or police, but noted that he is an animal lover who once owned a beloved feline named Cottonball. For former City Councilman Sal Albanese, it was a no-brainer. ‘What are we, nuts? Of course I would’ve stopped,’ he said. ‘This almost never happens, but when it does, we can’t just go running over kittens.’ Cat calls: both Anthony Weiner (left) and Christine Quinn stated that they would have shut off power in the subway to rescue the kitties. Weiner went so far as to say he would have personally saved them . With a name like that: John Catsimatidis said he would have deferred to the MTA or police, but noted that he is an animal lover who once had a cat . While the mayoral hopefuls were opining on the fate of the kittens, August and Arthur were recuperating at an Animal Care & Control shelter in the East New York section of Brooklyn. Sources told the Post that the 8-week-old pets have been kept together as they are undergoing physical and behavioral tests. August and Arthur, each weighing around 2lbs, will be vaccinated and then transferred to a foster home. Within a couple of weeks, they will be available for adoption. When the two tiny felines were spotted frolicking on the train tracks near the Church Avenue station in Brooklyn about 11am, Metropolitan Transportation Authority workers turned off the power.

Six . year old Aaliyah Felder was pronounced dead at the hospital the next day . as a result of injuries she sustained from not wearing a seat belt in . the crash. Phoenix police Sgt. Steve Martos said there's nothing to indicate the children's mother would face any charges in the Wednesday night crash. ‘There's really no criminal element to any of it,’ Martos said. ‘From mom's standpoint, there's nothing to indicate any neglect or abuse. From the kid's point, he's 8 years old so his mental state is not culpable.’ The mother bathed the children Wednesday night, put them to bed, and then went to bed herself. A half-hour later, her mother apparently came to their apartment and Bell discovered the children missing. Meanwhile, de la Cruz was following the red Hyundai down a nearby main thoroughfare for about three miles, reporting to the dispatcher as the young driver drifted into oncoming traffic. ‘It's a red car and it looks like they've already hit a few things, actually, the bumper's messed up, there's like scratches in the back,' he says. ‘Oh my God, OK, they almost hit somebody, they're swerving out of control right now.’ The two children drove their mother's car in the middle of the night and crashed it into a pole . The car later pulled into a . convenience store, and other drivers are heard honking their horns as . the boy circled back and began heading back toward his home. De la Cruz was reporting their progress the whole way, alternately coached and praised by the female dispatcher. ‘You're doing a great job, OK? I just want you to stay on the phone with me, OK?’ she said.Then, a squad car intercepted the sedan, and de la Cruz gave a tragic play-by-play. ‘OK, they're pulling them over, they turned on their lights right now. ... OK. Ohhhh, man.’ ‘Did the boy stop for the police?’ the dispatcher asks. ‘Yes, yes they stopped. He just crashed right now.’ ‘The little boy crashed? ‘Yes.’ The crash happened just three blocks from the family's apartment. Six-year-old Aaliyah Felder later died from her injuries. A makeshift memorial on a tree near the crash site was set up by family and neighbors . The . mother ran over after seeing the police activity and was visibly . distraught after discovering her children were in the car, Martos said. ‘It was a horrible and tragic moment for her,’ he said.

According . to family members the boy, who has not yet revealed why he took his . mother's car, may need surgery to recover from his injuries. The children's family told reporters that they are rallying around the mother in this difficult time. The children's aunt Felicia Sumlin fought back emotion as she tried to speak about her niece, 'Aaliyah ... I'm not ready to talk about it, Sumlin told FOX 10. Aaliyah's cousin Zakeeyah Habeel was still reeling from the news as she talked to reporters, saying, 'It was just really a shock... it's . something I'm still dealing with.

In 1706, he carried out an almost complete overhaul of the house, which is the only period home on Hampton Court Green other than Hampton Court Palace, with a garden stretching down to the Thames. Matthew Abernethy, director of Savills in Richmond, which is selling the property, said: 'He was owed wages for designing St Paul's Cathedral so rather than paying his salary arrears they gave home a 50 year lease on this property. Sir Christopher Wren was handed a 50-year lease on the Hampton property by Queen Anne in 1708 . The six-bedroom house has three bathrooms, three/four reception rooms, a kitchen/breakfast room, cellars, garage for at least two cars and a river mooring . The estate agent handling the sale said: 'You could not put a contemporary financial figure on it. Now you would say priceless' Architecture wasn't the only discipline Oxford graduate and former Westminster School pupil Sir Christopher Wren put his powers to. Wren was a pioneer across the scientific spectrum and responsible for several inventions. After graduation, Wren worked on astronomy research and . became a Professor of Astronomy at Gresham College in London and later . at Oxford. As an astronomer, he developed exceptional skills working . with models and diagrams, experimenting with creative ideas, and . engaging in scientific reasoning. Wren built a transparent beehive to help study bees, invented a weather clock similar to a barometer, invented an instrument for writing in the dark and developed improvements in the telescope and the microscope. He also experimented with injecting fluids into the veins of animals and laying the groundwork for successful blood transfusion and constructed a detailed model of the moon. 'Houses of this ilk are few and far . between. I can see someone getting emotionally engaged by it, with all . its fabulous historical features.' He . said of the price for Wren's work on St Paul's: 'You could not put a . contemporary financial figure on it. Now you would say priceless.' The study, formerly the dining room, . is panelled in wood by Wren himself, and also includes the same marble . fireplace he put in for King William III in Hampton Court Palace. Mr . Abernethy added: 'He immediately got to work designing and adding . features. He obviously liked the fire place he built for King William . because he straight away built one for himself. 'He did lots of bits and piece on the place and it remains a remarkable property.' He would not say whether the firm had had any interest from well known names, such as the Beckhams, who were house hunting the area last year. He said: 'We never disclose information of that sort.

Campaigners are calling for pills which allow drivers to drink five pints of beer and still pass a breathalyser test to be banned after a businessman began selling them in the UK. Arthur Kibble, 64, boasts the 'Alcopal' capsules allow motorists to drink until they are over the limit, yet still give a breath test which is nine times lower than it . should be. Kibble, from Birmingham, is selling the pills online and said he is not advocating drinking and driving. The pills have already been withdrawn in America but they are legally on . sale in Britain - where 280 people die on average each year as a result . of drink driving. Last week The Department of Transport revealed that the number of drink . driving deaths had risen by 12 per cent - the first increase in over a . decade. The pills, which . are taken before and after a drinking session, are said to prevent . alcohol being absorbed through the stomach and into the bloodstream. Kibble . sells the pills online via his website and said he had tested them . himself on Home Office-approved Draegar Breathalyser machines. Today, . the defiant businessman denied that he was encouraging motorists to . drink and drive, and said the pills were completely safe. He . said: 'The pills work by preventing the absorption of alcohol from the . inner lining of the stomach and the intestine into the bloodstream. 'All of the ingredients are natural, there’s no prescription stuff in there.' Kibble has tested the pulls himself and says they reduce a breathalyser reading nine times lower than expected . Mr Kibble claims the tablets prevent the absorption of alcohol into the blood stream, and that scientists then noted this affected blood alcohol readings taken in a breath test. The Mail Online has been able to locate the source of the tablets, but Kibble insists they are well-known in the pharmaceutical business. He said: 'They were tried initially in the USA but were withdrawn after pressure on the drug firms. 'The pharmaceutical industry spent millions on the research but decided not to go ahead with mass production.' If the tablets do stop alcohol being absorbed, then this will reduce the effect of alcohol on the user. Kibble added that a pharmacist involved in the research had continued to . produce the tablets, said to be made of herbal extract and carbon, for . sale in the UK. He added: 'I am not advocating that motorists get blind drunk and then try to drive, but it does help you mentally. 'Because it prevents the uptake of alcohol and gives some protection to your liver and kidneys you’re more in control. 'I have had my lawyers check them out and they are perfectly safe and legal, otherwise I would not be selling them. 'They are targeted at anyone, especially those people who have two pints and are then banned for 12 months. 'What about bus drivers and taxi drivers who want to have a pint before work? 'Everyone does it, there’s a car park in every pub you go to.' The legal limit for driving is 35 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath. Mr Kibble claims the Alcopal pills can reduce this reading to just 4mcg per 100ml. His website says: 'Going out to celebrate or just having a good time. Be careful if your (sic) driving. Always take ALCO-PAL with you. 'Take the recommended dose and it will make all the difference if your breathalysed ALCO-PAL helps to reduce the alcohol breath you expel from your lungs.'

Lying almost 4,000 metres above sea level, this vast salt lake nestled amid the snow-capped peaks of Tajikistan's Pamir Plateau is one of the highest in the world. Believed to have been formed when a meteor struck the earth millions of years ago, the aquamarine waters of Lake Karakul appear oasis-like amid the barren, stony landscape of the soaring Pamirs - known since Victoria times as the 'roof of the world'. But despite its beauty, the ancient lake is home to little marine life aside from a few hardy loaches, and locals claim the water is so dense with salt that anyone who tried to sail a boat across the surface would find themselves capsizing. Scroll down for video . The Dead Sea of Pamir: Lake Karakul, also know as the 'Black Lake', is a vast salt lake in the Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan . Less inviting than it looks: The vast salt take lies in the Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan, where the small population endures long and bitterly cold winters broken only short, cool summers . According to an article on EnglishRussia.com, the water is so dense that boats simply turn over, meaning anyone who wishes to sail along the lake must use a special raft weighted down with lead plates. The more dense water is, the more likely it is that things floating on its surface will become unbalanced, because the depth of flotation is much higher. Karakul is an inhospitable . environment for its few inhabitants - a small community of Kyrgyz . people living in a village that takes its name from the lake. The community survives in the bleak region on the border with Kashgar, one of Central Asia's most sparsely populated regions, through the nomadic herding of flocks of sheep, yaks or goats. The villagers spend the summer in the high pastures, but in winter return to Karakul, tending fires in their yurts to endure the penetrating cold in the mountains, which can plummet to -45C in the winter months. The lake is famous for the ever-changing colours of its surface, which reflects the surrounding peaks and shimmers dark green, azure or light blue depending on the light. But when the sun slips behind the clouds the depths of the lake - which is 238metres deep in parts - appear dark as night. It is the this quality that saw the ancient crater lake christened Lake Karakul, or the 'black lake'. In the 19th Century the British named the salt lake Lake Victoria in honour of their monarch, and all British maps from that period label it as Lake Victoria of the Pamirs. That name is understood to have fallen out of use with the advent of the Soviets, and once again the salt lake became known by its Kyrgyz title. See more of Vladimir Trofimov's work here. Stunning scenery: The vast salt lake, the highest of the Pamir Plateau and the biggest of hundreds of ancient lakes in the region, makes for spectacular scenery . Bleak: Lying at the extreme edges of habitation, the landscape surrounding the lake has no trees of flowers, and is home only to the occasional sheep or yak . Endurance: The area around Lake Karakul is home to a village of the same name, where a small community of Kyrgyz live in yurts and herd yaks and sheep . Barren: Rocky ground surrounds the lake in the Pamirs in Tajikistan, close to the border with western China . Vast: The high salt content in the lake's waters mean Karakul is home to scant marine life, apart from a few hardy loaches . Shades: The clear waters of Karakul can take on dazzling shades of green or blue - but its shadowy appearance when the sun moves behind the clouds mean it is sometimes known as the 'black lake' High altitudes: The high, rugged peaks of the Pamirs are reflected in the glassy surface of the ancient salt lake, believed to have been formed when a meteor struck the earth . Remote: Lake Karakal lies in the Tajik Pamirs close to the border with Kashgar, China, in one of the most sparsely populated regions of Central Asia . Inhospitable: Karakul's inhabitants, nomadic farmers, spend the summer months in the high pastures before returning to the village in winter, burning fires to ward off the penetrating cold . The 'roof of the world': Divided into two basins, Lake Karakul sits amid spectacular scenery in the rugged Pamirs . Survival: The small Kyrgyz community in the village of Karakul spend the summer months in the high pastures, before returning to the village to sit out the bitter cold . Lone: Lying close to the border with Kashgar in western China, the lake is within one of the most sparsely populated regions of Central Asia . Views: The surface of the water changes from black to azure to deepest green depending on how the light falls on Karakul . Vast: In Victorian times the British marked the lake on maps as Lake Victoria, in honour of their monarch, but the name fell out of use with the advent of the Soviets . Nomadic: The Kyrgyz community that lives in the village of Karakul in the remote region herds small flocks of sheep, goat or yaks amid the barren landscape .","Ancient Karakul lies 4,000m above sea level in Tajikistan's Pamir Mountains - known as the 'roof of the world'

Mr McClurg took off from Bald Mountain, Idaho, taking in stunning sights as he crossed several mountain ranges including the three boulders, Pioneers and Continental Divide before landing at the edge of Canyon Ferry Lake, just outside of Helena, Montana. Record-breaker: Gavin Mcclurg (photographed by his wife Jody MacDonald) broke the U.S. Distance Paragliding Foot Launch Record when he glided 240 miles over the mountain ranges of the American West . Stunning: Mcclurg, 41, glided for seven-and-a-half hours from Bald Mountain, Idaho, over the wild landscapes before landing at Canyon Ferry Lake, Montana . Jaw-dropping: The paraglider took in unparalleled views during the glide, which smashed the previous record of 204 miles set last year . The record breaking flight smashed the previous 204-mile record set by Jon Hunt and Nick Greece last year. Mr McClurg's wife, Jody Macdonald, who is also a paraglider and photographer, joined her husband on his record-breaking flight, as she followed closely behind capturing his feat on camera. The paraglider, who now holds the U.S. Distance Paragliding Foot Launch Record, said he was thrilled. He said: 'My wife Jody is a paraglider pilot and she taught me the basics. 'I love paragliding, the adrenaline, the danger, the remoteness, the freedom, the impossibility of it all. Every single time I'm in the air I can't believe what I'm doing. 'And it is by far and away the most intense and gratifying sport I have ever done. 'I fly before I do anything else, and as much as possible. I'm totally addicted, I'm a junky. 'This year, I flew in Mexico and Colombia for all of January, April through June in the European Alps. And we moved to Sun Valley last year because in my opinion it's the best big mountain paragliding site on Earth. Adrenaline junkie: McClurg said he is addicted to the 'danger, remoteness, freedom' of the sport and travels all over the world to take in the best views . High-flyer: McClurg sailed at speeds of over 30mph and more than 18,000ft high during the glide and said he was thrilled when he finally broke the record . Alien landscape: The paraglider said the area is 'untapped' and the possibilities of over North America are 'literally endless' 'I never specifically set out to break . the record. I'm just always trying to fly as far as I can, taking routes . that are challenging and interesting. 'The . American West is untapped - we have so few pilots in North American . compared with Europe that the possibilities are literally endless. 'This . was a huge flight, but it's just cracking the surface of what's . possible. So every time I'm in the air, if the weather presents a good . day, I try to fly as far as I can.' The couple have paraglided around the world and have taken stunning photographs over the Himalayas, Morocco, Namibia and Mozambique. Mr McClurg said he needed to carry food and water during his record-breaking glide. He said: 'It's very likely on these big flights that you could land an awfully long way from a road, so you've got to be able to get yourself out. 'The day before I broke the record, I'd just achieved my personal best of 192 miles. And just a few days before that was another personal best of 159 miles. So it was a good week.' Despite his love for the sport, Mr McClurg acknowledges how dangerous it can be. On a roll: In the week before the glide, McClurg broke his personal best twice before finally smashing the U.S. Distance record . Dedication: McClurg and his wife Jody MacDonald, who is also a paraglider and photographer, have travelled across the world to pursue their love for the sport . He said: 'You're flying in extremely turbulent conditions in this part of the world, especially in the middle of the day when the thermals are cranking. At times I was in climbs that were in excess of 8 meters per second. Sun Valley is known as one of the most demanding places to fly that there is. 'This particular flight saw the strongest conditions I'd ever flown in - windy and incredibly strong thermals. 'So I had to focus really hard, for a long time, but it seemed I was just in the right head space. Maybe I was ""in the zone"" as they say. At one point though I nearly landed at 319km into the flight - the exact distance I'd gone the day before. 'When I knew I'd broken the record I was ecstatic, just a short while before I had nearly landed - my track recorder showed I was just 35 meters off the ground. 'And suddenly I was back up at cloud base and I knew I had the record in hand and it was just an insane exclamation point to the best flight I'd ever done. 'There are a lot of pilots in the world right now who could have gone farther than I did, it just takes the right mind-set and a lot of hours in the saddle as we say. 'But the most important thing is getting the right day, and then identifying when you're up there that you've got the day and can push hard.

The brother of Fifty Shades of Grey author EL James was tonight cleared of causing a pensioner’s death by careless motorway driving. Daniel Mitchell’s Porsche Cayenne S ploughed into the back of 73-year-old Mollie Haines’ stranded Nissan Almera, killing her outright and sending her car spinning down the road in flames. She had been stuck in fast-flowing motorway traffic after being unable to get her car going again following an earlier jam on the southbound M40 near Beaconsfield, Bucks. Trial: Mollie Haines (left), 73, was killed when her stranded Nissan Almera was struck from behind by Daniel Mitchell(right)’s Porsche Cayenne on the M40 motorway near Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, in July 2012 . Mr Mitchell, a 48-year-old . professional lorry driver and logistics co-ordinator, had been driving . from a doctor’s appointment to his work in Iver, Bucks., when the crash . happened, just before 10am on July 18 last year. In his police interview hours after the crash he told officers: 'I just didn’t see this car. I just hit this car in lane two. 'I didn’t expect this car to be in lane two. It was just there. Daniel Mitchell is the brother of E.L. James - author of the best-selling Fifty Shades of Grey series . 'People who look at the Porsche think ‘well, he drives like Michael Schumacher’, which I don’t.' As . an experienced HGV driver he said he was used to driving in lane one of . the motorway at no more than 56mph and that when in his own car he . would travel between 60 and 70mph. However, prosecution and defence experts concluded that before the crash he had been driving at a minimum speed of 70mph. The . defendant also said that he normally drove in lane one of the motorway . and that the fact that he was in lane two meant he must have overtaken . somebody. Beyond that he had limited memory of the tragic events. He said: “All I remember is just looking and realising this car is stationary. “I think I tried to swerve. I don’t think I even had a chance to brake.” He informed officers he drove 'the best part of 50,000 to 60,000 miles a year all across Europe' and had never had an accident. Prosecutors argued that other drivers had seen and managed to avoid Mrs Haines’ car but he had not. The . defence countered that by pointing out that a witness described a . number of near misses, one driver had not seen the obstruction but had . it pointed out to him by his passenger and another suspected had the . neighbouring lane not been free for him to swerve into, he would have . hit the Nissan. Mrs Haines, . a retired orthoptist and golf club president from Bromsgrove, in the . West Midlands, was on her way to Kingston-upon-Thames in Surrey, to . visit her daughter and grandchildren. When she realised there was a problem she called her husband Charles, who told her to contact the AA. Fireball: The collision's force sent Mrs Haines's vehicle spinning along the southbound carriageway of the M40 motorway, before it burst into flames . Another . motorist pulled onto the hard shoulder and dialled 999 and a Highways . Agency worker then turned a camera and zoomed in on the Nissan, only to . watch helplessly as the Porsche slammed into it seconds later. Following the verdict, Judge Francis Sheridan said: 'If ever there was a case for a jury, this was it.' Adding . that it had been a distressing case for both families, he asked . everyone to leave the court in silence as a mark of respect to Mrs . Haines. Neither Mr . Mitchell, of The Common, Flackwell Heath, Bucks., nor the Haines family . wished to comment as they left the court, in Amersham. Mr . Mitchell’s older sibling, Erika, wrote the erotic novel Fifty Shades of . Grey which became a global sensation last year, selling more than 70 . million copies. Wreckage: Mithcell told the jury as an experienced lorry driver he was used to driving in lane one . Jake Slade, who had been driving his . BMW 320 along the same southbound carriageway, told the court: 'That . section of the M40 is quite windy and as you come round to that . particular junction your visibility is only 200 to 300 yards. 'I was in lane two and I became aware . of a vehicle that wasn't moving particularly fast but I wasn't aware as . to whether it had come to a complete stop. 'I was about 150 to 200 yards behind when I realised it wasn't moving at all. 'I braked very heavily. If I hadn't braked so heavily I probably wouldn't have stopped in time.' He changed lanes, passed the car and pulled onto the hard shoulder and dialled 999. The witness said he could not remember . seeing any hazard lights on on the Nissan when he was approaching from . behind but did see them flashing when looking back at it in his mirror . from the hard shoulder. Investigation: Mitchell told police after the crash: 'I didn't even have time to brake' He saw a woman aged in her 60s or 70s inside, who appeared to be either looking at the dashboard or slumped forward. 'Vehicles were missing the car narrowly,' he said. 'The motorway got very busy very quickly and it became more and more difficult for cars to avoid her.' He did not see the impact itself but was aware of the Nissan suddenly shooting forwards and then spinning and being on fire. Other motorists remembered seeing the . vehicle but only becoming aware of it seconds before either having to . pass it or before the collision.

The son of the president of Suriname has been arrested on U.S. drug and weapon charges, federal prosecutors said Friday. Dino Bouterse, director of Suriname's anti-terrorism unit, was arrested on Thursday in Panama by local authorities and turned over to U.S. agents, said Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. His arrest comes as his father, Desi Bouterse, himself convicted of drug offenses, hosts the annual UNASUR summit for leaders of South American countries. Arrested: Dino Bouterse was taken by local authorities in Panama on Thursday and handed over the U.S. agents on drugs and weapons charges . Officials in Suriname announced on Friday that the opening statement by Desi Bouterse would be postponed by several hours. Local government officials have declined further comment. Dino Bouterse was scheduled to appear in Manhattan federal court on Friday afternoon after being flown to New York late on Thursday, officials said. 'Bouterse is a significant drug trafficker,' said Derek Maltz, special agent-in-charge with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Bouterse faces a U.S. federal indictment alleging he worked with a man identified as Edmund Quincy Muntslag to smuggle cocaine into the United States starting in or about December 2011. It also charges him with violating firearms laws by brandishing a light anti-tank weapon during the narcotics offense. The indictment says Bouterse was involved in smuggling a suitcase filled with 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of cocaine aboard a commercial flight from Suriname to the Caribbean in late July. Federal prosecutors said Muntslag was arrested Thursday in the Caribbean island of Trinidad. Bouterse's father is a former coup leader and convicted drug trafficker who was elected president of Suriname in July 2010. Shortly after his inauguration, Bouterse appointed his son as director of Suriname's Counter Terrorist Unit, drawing heavy criticism from opposition legislators who expressed concern that no legal framework was created for the unit to operate. Shady past: Suriname president and Dino's father Desi Bouterse, has previously been convicted of drugs offenses . In 2011, unit officials were criticized for acting as police officers when they killed two men suspected in several violent crimes. In August 2002, prosecutors in Suriname charged Dino Bouterse with stealing 50 guns from the government intelligence service. Police at the time accused Bouterse of fleeing to Curacao to avoid arrest, although his father said Bouterse had traveled there for personal business. A year later, prosecutors dropped charges, citing a lack of evidence. Police detained the younger Bouterse again in September 2004 after seizing a large number of assault weapons, ammunition and 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of cocaine from a local auto shop. He was sentenced to eight years in prison in August 2005 after a judge found him guilty of leading a ring that trafficked in cocaine, illegal arms and stolen luxury cars. Tropical: Suriname is an impoverished country of around half a million in South America . The president, a two-time dictator who first seized power during a 1980 coup, was convicted in absentia in 1999 on drug trafficking charges by a court in the Netherlands. At home, he and 24 associates face trial on charges of killing 15 prominent political opponents in 1982, but the case has been stalled while courts determine if they are covered by an amnesty law adopted last year. Bouterse has said he intends to run for a second elected term as the 2015 elections approach. The former Dutch colony of some 560,000 people is located on the shoulder of South America. Its economy relies largely on exports of alumina, gold and oil, although roughly 70 percent of is population lives below the poverty level.","Dino Bouterse, director of South American country's anti-terrorism unit, was arrested ."

A friend of the surviving Boston Marathon bombing suspect was indicted Thursday for allegedly making false statements to authorities. Prosecutors said Robel Phillipos faces up to 16 years in prison in connection with two federal criminal counts. But attorneys for the 19-year-old say he will continue to fight the allegations against him. Association: Robel Phillipos in court on May 1, 2013. Today he was indicted on two charges of lying to authorities which could put him behind bars for 16 years if convicted . 'In time, it will be clear that this prosecution should not have been brought in the first place,' lawyers Derege Demissie and Susan Church said in a statement. Following Phillipos' May arrest on one count of lying to authorities, a judge ordered him released on $100,000 bond, putting him on home confinement and electronic monitoring. Phillipos met 20-year-old bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev while they were students at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. Friends: Phillipos met Dzokhar Tsarnaev at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth where they were both students . In arguing for bail in May, Phillipos' lawyers portrayed him as a frightened and confused young man 'who was subjected to intense questioning and interrogation, without the benefit of counsel, and in the context of one of the worst attacks against the nation.' Friends and relatives have described him in court documents as a considerate and thoughtful person who was the son of a single mother who emigrated from Ethiopia to the United States. The brothers Tsarnaev: Dzokhar Tsarnaev, left, and his older brother Tamerlan, right, are the suspected bombers behind the Boston Marathon bombings this past spring .

The April 15 bombing killed three people and injured more than 260 others near the race's finish line. Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov, two other friends of Tsarnaev's, already have pleaded not guilty to allegations they conspired to obstruct justice by agreeing to destroy and conceal some of his belongings as he evaded authorities after the attack. Criminals? Two other school friends of Tsarnaev's are being charged with obstruction of justice. Both are Kazakhstani in ethnicity: Dias Kadyrabayev, left and Azamat Tazhayakov, right . Authorities have alleged Phillipos was with Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov in Tsarnaev's dorm room on April 18, and the three left with items including Tsarnaev's laptop and a backpack with fireworks. They claim Phillipos concealed that the three went to the dorm room and took Tsarnaev's backpack, and that he repeatedly lied to investigators during interviews. But Phillipos' lawyers said Thursday it's clear that he had nothing to do with taking the backpack or destroying potential evidence.","Robel Phillipos was indicted today on two charges of lying to authorities .

The adult daughter of a woman whose baby was fatally shot in his stroller testified Wednesday that her mother's account of what happened that day didn't add up. A defense lawyer called Ashley Glassey to testify in the murder trial of his client, De'Marquise Elkins, who is charged in the March 21 killing of 13-month-old Antonio Santiago in coastal Georgia. Glassey's mother, Sherry West, has said she was walking home from the Brunswick post office with Antonio in a stroller when Elkins, 18, and another teen approached her and demanded money. After she told them she didn't have any, Elkins shot her in the leg and then shot the baby in the face, West has said. Scroll down for video . Suspicious: Ashley Glassey doesn't beleive mother Sharon West about the circumstances surrounding her baby brother's death . Glassey, 21, lives in New Jersey and testified through tears that she had only seen her mother for a few hours on one occasion since she was 8 years old. Glassey said her mother called her at 8:30 p.m. the day of the shooting. West told her daughter two kids had come up to her and asked for money and then shot the baby and then her when she said she had none, Glassey said. When Glassey asked for more details, West changed the story to say she was shot first and the baby second, Glassey said. Glassey's grandmother had died the summer before and she had collected her grandmother's life insurance policy to cover expenses, Glassey said. Her mother knew that and called to ask how fast Glassey thought it would take for her to get the payment from a life insurance policy she had taken out on the baby. ""The whole conversation just didn't settle well with me,"" Glassey said. A life ended too soon: 13-month-old Antonio Santago (left) was shot to death by De'Marquise Elkins, according to Sharon West (right) Questionable: West is alleged to have asked estranged daughter Glassey about how to collect a life insurance policy on her dead toddler only hours after the shooting . Because she thought her mother's story didn't add up, she called law enforcement in Brunswick to tell them that and said she needed to talk to detectives in the case, she said. But when the police didn't call her, she told some media outlets how her mother had asked about the life insurance payout. After Glassey's statements appeared, an angry West called her and told her she had no business talking to the news and that's the last time the two spoke, Glassey said. West testified Tuesday that she had taken out a life insurance policy on her young son because he had been sick just after he was born and someone at the hospital mentioned the idea to her. She took out a $5,000 policy from Gerber Life Insurance Co., she said. West paid a premium of $3.18 each month, and when her son was killed, she cashed in the policy, she said. She used $2,000 for funeral costs for Antonio and used the balance to pay her moving expenses, she said. In tears: Glassey chokes back tears as she testifies to her suspicions surrounding her baby brother's death . Accused: De'Marquise Elkins, 18, is accused of shooting both Santiago and West despite West picking the wrong person in a police lineup . Prosecutors say Elkins and an accomplice, 15-year-old Dominique Lang, stopped West, and the older teen pointed a small .22-caliber revolver at her and demanded money before shots were fired. The killing in the port city of Brunswick drew national attention, and the trial was moved to the Atlanta suburb of Marietta owing to extensive publicity . Elkins faces life in prison if convicted of murder. At the time of the shooting he was 17, too young to face the death penalty if convicted under Georgia law. Lang, who also faces murder charges, is to be tried at a later date. Prosecutors have said information from Elkins' mother and sister led investigators to a pond where they found a revolver. Karimah Elkins is standing trial alongside her son on charges of evidence tampering and lying to police. Elkins' sister also was charged with evidence tampering. Prosecutors have also accused De'Marquise Elki .","Ashley Glassey testified that estranged mother Sherry West changed her story about the attack after her initial claim .

An ABC News editor has announced he is, in fact, a man, after having changed gender earlier this year to be a woman. Don Ennis, who in May asked friends and colleagues to call him Dawn after what he said was a seven-year battle with his identity, is reverting to his former gender after a two-day bout of amnesia. After just a three-month stint as a woman, Dawn Ennis was rushed to hospital because he thought he was having a seizure, according to the New York Post, and he was experiencing a loss of memory. The ABC News producer as Dawn Ennis, left, and as Don again, right. The journalist told friends and colleagues the change back to Don again was after a two-day bout of amnesia when he thought he was in 1999 . During that time, he had accused his wife of 17 years, from whom he had separated when he decided to live life as Dawn, of having dressed him up in a wig and making fake IDs with the name 'Dawn' on it, the NY Post said. The confused news editor, a father-of-three, thought the year was 1999, and couldn't understand why he was a woman. Mr Ennis's memory has now fully returned, and while he remembers choosing to go through the gender switch, taking hormones to change his body, he now says: 'It appears I'm not transgender after all.' In an email sent to friends and colleagues, the ABC newsman, from Danbury, Connecticut, opens up about what he has experienced and urges those who supported the first switch to try to support his return to Don. The email, published by the NY Post, says: 'I have retained the much different mind-set I had in 1999: I am now totally, completely, unabashedly male in my mind, despite my physical attributes.' Big changes: Dawn Ennis, pictured as Don before the transition with wife Wendy. Don has lived three months as Dawn but has decided to switch back to being Don again . Support: Mr Ennis, left as Don, said he was 'heartbroken' to have moved out of the family home, leaving his beloved . wife Wendy, right. Mrs Ennis has been supportive throughout the change; Mr Ennis hopes friends and family will accept his decision to revert back to being Don again . The Connecticut journalist explains that while his memories of the last 14 years have returned, his female identity did not. He says he is no longer wearing women's clothes or make-up and is already using the men's room accordingly, however, he vows to be a staunch advocate for equal rights and LGBT issues. The 49-year-old journalist told friends and colleagues in May this year that he believed his gender mix-up was linked to his mother giving him oestrogen as a child to prolong his childhood acting career. However, he says he ended up developing breasts and thinking as a woman. After years of living with a condition which doctors were unable to explain, he said, he finally decided to switch genders. He separated from his wife of 17 years, Wendy Ennis, and friends and colleagues he said have been hugely supportive of his decision. His wife came to terms with his first decision, and eventually accepted the new identity of Dawn, the news service said. True to herself: Dawn Ennis's new Facebook profile posted in May as she began her new life with a new identity . Long journey: A post written prior to the full transition shows the brave battle 'Dawn' faced before taking the final step . He now hopes that friends and . colleagues will not think his reverting back to be a male again is a . joke, or because the change was too hard. He . said in the email: 'The new change I'm revealing to you today did not . arise because I couldn't hack it, or people would accept the . new/real/female ""me"", or I had trouble finding shoes that fit (Oh, I . found plenty, more than I could afford).' Don Ennis changed his Facebook profile image from one of himself as Dawn, to a picture of an old teddy bear last week. With it, he wrote the message: 'Mister Bear lost his nose and his mouth . decades ago to a family dog. He's spent much of the past 40 years in a . cardboard box, and is now also losing a little stuffing. But despite a . cleaning, he retains that familiar smell and feel.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . PUBLISHED: . 08:31 EST, 24 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:41 EST, 24 July 2013 . Instagram is the most depressing social network and even worse than Facebook, according to a U.S magazine. Jessica Winter from Slate claims that Instagram takes the parts of Facebook that make people feel depressed and unsatisfied with their lot, such as looking at other people's photos and friend's broadcasting how great their lives are, and accentuates them. This then creates feelings of intense jealousy and also crosses the 'grey line of stalkerism'. A journalist for U.S magazine Slate puts forward the idea that Instagram is the most depressing social network, and is worse than Facebook and Twitter for people bragging, posting smug photos and creating feelings of jealousy . Winter claims Instagram is depressing because it is photo-led. Photos are the most explicit way for people to show off . In her article, Winter speaks to communications and psychology professors that have previously written studies on the effects of Facebook in a bid to bolster her claims. The first reason why Winter believes Instagram is so depressing is that it 'purifies' the three worst aspects of Facebook associated with causing envy. She names this as scrolling through hundreds of other people's photos - including strangers' - liking images and seeking likes and approval from peers, and announcing to millions of people how great their lives are. Winter claims that Instagram takes these traits and amplifies them. She adds this is because the site is picture-led and photos are the easiest way for people to show off because they provide an isolated snapshot in time. Hanna Krasnova of Humboldt University Berlin told Winter: 'You get more explicit and implicit cues of people being happy, rich, and successful from a photo than from a status update. She continues: 'If you see beautiful photos of your friend on Instagram, one way to compensate is to self-present with even better photos, and then your friend sees your photos and posts even better photos, and so on. 'Self-promotion triggers more self-promotion, and the world on social media gets further and further from reality.' Instagram photos also cross the 'grey line of stalkerism', according to Winter. This is because it's easier to strike up a conversation about a shared article on Facebook, for example, without it seeming too personal. However, if someone tells a stranger they've looked through their photos, it can seem intrusive . Viewers also don't know what else is happening around the image. For example, a couple on holiday could be posting beautiful images while arguing the whole time. Winter believes this gives a . distorted view of the person posting the photo's world, which in turn . distorts the viewers' opinion of their own lives. It leads people to think their life isn't fulfilling enough and makes them feel depressed. She adds that the more someone does this, the more distorted their view becomes and the less meaningful their life feels. Winter continues that as well as making people feel depressed, Instagram also crosses the 'grey line of stalkerism.' She uses the example of a science article being posted on Facebook compared to a honeymoon photo being uploaded to Instagram. Winter explains that if a friend posts a science article on Facebook, it's easier to strike up a conversation about the article without it seeming too personal. However, if someone tells a friend, or even someone they don't know, that they've looked through their honeymoon photos, it can seem personal and intrusive - even if the photos were shared publicly. Facebook can make you feel socially . isolated and miserable because seeing friends' happy pictures triggers . feelings of envy, according to experts from Berlin's Humboldt University . and Darmstadt's Technical University. They claim one in three people feel . worse after visiting the site and that their 'general dissatisfaction' with life had increased. The German researchers studied 600 . people and found that those who browsed without contributing were more . likely to feel bad afterwards. Positive images of friends enjoying . holidays, commenting on their happy lives or simply posting pet pictures . was enough to trigger feelings of jealousy, . The Facebook test group said what . riled them most were happy holiday snaps of 'Facebook friends' followed . by gushing prose of fabulous lives, great jobs and cracking social . diaries. The academics added people who surfed a lot on such sites were in danger of becoming socially isolated and depressed.","U.S. magazine claims Instagram accentuates the worst parts of Facebook .

A man has been arrested in Mexico after he allegedly sent emails to the FBI and media outlets threatening to decapitate Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. Aniruddha Sherbow, 43, was apprehended by California police Wednesday in Tijuana. He was then turned over to federal agents in San Diego. The alleged threats occurred August 1 and 3, according to the FBI and U.S. Capitol Police. Tragedy averted: Aniruddha Sherbow, 43 (left), was arrested in Mexico for allegedly sending an email to FBI threatening to sever the head of Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (right) ‘I, Aniruddha Sherbow, with the Divine as my witness, do hereby solemnly vow to find Tulsi Gabbard, wheresoever she may be, and to sever her head from her body,’ he wrote to the FBI, according to the Hawaii Reporter, which said it had also received a copy of the email from Sherbow. The FBI would not confirm the nature of Sherbow’s threat, saying only that it was based on a ‘credible’ threat. Sherbow will face charges of transmission of threats in interstate commerce, authorities said. Sherbow will make his first court appearance later today before being returned to Washington. Gabbard spokeswoman Heather Fluit said she had no comment other than that the first-term congresswoman ‘is grateful for the work of the U.S. Capitol Police, FBI, and all law enforcement officers involved in this investigation.’ Mr Sherbow reportedly has a history of harassment and threats targeting Gabbard, 32. In 2011, Gabbard, who was then a city councilwoman in Honolulu, sought and received a three-year injunction against Sherbow after a series of abusive telephone calls and text messages. Miss Gabbard told the Honolulu Star Advertiser in March 2011 that Sherbow had been ‘calling me numerous times, at strange hours’ and sending messages that were ‘extremely inappropriate, profane, vulgar and sexual in nature.’ ‘Basically, taking it as far as he could go,’ Gabbard told the newspaper. History of violence: In 2011, Gabbard, then a city councilwoman in Honolulu, obtained a three-year injunction against Sherbow after a series of disturbing and profane phone calls and texts . Gabbard said then that she contacted police after Sherbow’s messages became more abusive, including one that said if she approached him he would force her to perform a sexual act. Miss Gabbard is an Iraq War veteran and was elected to Congress in 2012. She is one of the first two female combat veterans, first Hindu and first woman of Samoan descent to serve as a U.S. representative. Mr Sherbow, a philosophy major and author who goes by the moniker 'Sphinx the writer', referred to Gabbard as 'The Prima Donna' who made his feel 'insignificant' in his correspondence with the Hawaii Reporter. Sherbow told the paper that he had approached Gabbard offering to volunteer in her council office as a PR person, but was rejected by her and eventually thrown in jail without being charged. The 43-year-old claimed that he was never served with the restraining order obtained by Gabbard, and said that he was falsely accused by the congresswoman of threatening her. The aspiring writer told the paper that initially he wanted to reach out to Gabbard because they both hail from the Hare Krishna Movement. ‘Because of this last connection, I think she is counting on me not hurting her.

A teenager who was 'out of control' on mephedrone set off a makeshift nail bomb in a railway carriage and stole lethal potassium cyanide to build another device. Stuart Lee, 19, could have caused serious harm, said a judge at Gloucester Crown Court today as he jailed the youngster for five and a half years. 'As it happens no-one was hurt,' Judge Jamie Tabor QC told Lee. 'But had you had time to mix up the substances you had stolen there was potential for a very unpleasant explosion and the release of some very unpleasant gases including gases containing cyanide.' Jailed: Both Stuart Lee, left, 19, of Pillowell, near Lydney, Gloucestershire, and Dexter Cunnington, right, 27, of Tutshill Rise, Lydney, were 'out of control' on mephedrone at the time of their offences, a judge said . Lee, of Pillowell, near Lydney, Gloucestershire, pleaded guilty to arson, possession of explosive materials, burglary and theft of hydrochloric acid and potassium cyanide. He also pleaded guilty to attempted robbery and attempting to pervert the course of justice over an attack on a 16-year-old mephedrone dealer, who was left in a coma for two and a half weeks and now faces health lasting problems. Judge Tabor sentenced Lee to two years in a young offenders institute for the explosives offences, three years for the attempted robbery and six months for perverting justice. He passed concurrent sentences for all the other offences Lee admitted, making his total term five and a half years. Cuffed: Lee was sentenced to five and a half . years after admitting a string of offences including an attack which . left a teenage drug dealer in a coma . Also in the dock was Dexter . Cunnington, 27, of Tutshill Rise, Lydney, who pleaded guilty to the . attempted robbery and perverting justice offences which he committed . jointly with Lee. He was jailed for four and a half years. Judge Tabor said it was clear that both defendants were at the time of the offences last year ‘out of control’ because of their use of mephedrone. Their cases showed clearly that the use of mephedrone, a former 'legal high' banned in 2010 and which is rife in Gloucestershire, is not harmess as many users think, said the judge. Julian Kesner, prosecuting, said Lee’s first crime was theft of £100 worth of aftershave from Boot’s on 29th June last year, Police bailed him and he went on to make a nail bomb the following month. He put the device in a railway carriage in a siding at Lydney station and set it alight on a disposable barbecue. Pictures on his mobile phone showed how he had laid out nails, screws and snooker balls to make the device. He used masking tape to stick them to an aerosol can. Mr Kesner told the court that on September 11 last year Lee researched potassium cyanide and hydrochloric acid and then went on to burgle the Whitecroft Essentials factory in Lydney. He took flour and a knife from one department and then - with the help of a 14-year-old boy - containers of hydrochloric and sulphuric acid and potassium cyanide from another. He boasted to the boy, whom he paid £10 for his assistance, that one spoonful of the powder would kill 5-6 people. The containers of acid they took contained 30 litres each and needed the pair of them to carry them, Mr Kesner said. The next day police raided the 14-year-old boy’s house - where Lee had left the chemicals - and he was arrested. A Portdon Down scientist found that, mixed in a paint tin, the pressure of the acid and cyanide would have caused a forceful blast, said Mr Kesner. It would also have released poisonous hydrogen cyanide gas, the expert witness concluded. Dangerous drug: The cases of Lee and Cunnington . showed clearly that the use of mephedrone, a former 'legal high' banned . in 2010, which is rife in Gloucestershire, is not harmess as many users . think, said the judge . The attempted robbery committed by Cunnington and Lee was on a 16-year-old boy who was selling mephedrone in Lydney, Mr Kesner told the court. Mephedrone became popular among youngsters several years ago as a more easily available - and legal - replacement for MDMA, the active ingredient in ecstasy tablets. Chemically similar to compounds found in the khat plant of eastern Africa, it is said to have the euphoric effects of ecstasy and the energising qualities of amphetamines, but with the short-lived hit of a line of cocaine. The Talk To Frank drugs awareness service warns that it can also induce feelings of paranoia and anxiety, and overstimulate the nervous system leading to fits. For a while easily available through web sites sourcing it from Chinese laboratories, the substance was finally banned in 2010 after it was linked to a string of deaths. The boy was lured to Church Road, Lydney, by a 14-year-old girl he was seeing at the time who was working with Lee and Cunnington. There he was waylaid by the pair. Cunnington hit him repeatedly on the head and he suffered two skull fractures and was in a coma in hospital for two and a half weeks. Mr Kesner said he had been left with damage to his sense of smell and hearing. He also has difficulty with recall and verbal fluency as a result of his injuries. Fiona Elder, for Lee, said he has been in custody on remand for almost a year and is now free of drugs and determined not to go back on them. Lee was a young man who had done badly at school except for science and he had since ‘expanded that interest in an illegal way and he now recognises a potentially dangerous way,’ she said. For Cunnington, Nicola Colwill said he too had been abusing mephedrone and mixing with teenagers instead of facing up to his adult responsibilities - he has a partner and two children.","Stuart Lee, 19, was jailed for five and a half years for a string of offences .

With its genius construction, the Cuddle Mattress promises to allow night cuddling without risking a dreaded dead arm. It comprises a single foam block central portion for the body, and ten slats at the top and ten at the bottom, allowing for arms and feet to dip in. The Cuddle Mattress features clever foam slats allowing for cuddling arms to slide in comfortably . The three-inch wide slats part easily from one another, leaving room to slide an arm beneath a partner and leave it there. The Cuddle Mattress could strengthen relationships, says its designer, by letting partners remain cuddled together. Because their body is supported by the slats on each side of the encircling arm, it should not get squashed, however long it is left there. The mattress designer says a similar arrangement at the foot of the bed means anyone who is able to tear themselves away from their partner for the night can sleep face-down with their toes pointing down into the mattress and snug between the slats. Dead arms need not be an issue with this genius concept by award-winning designer Mehdi Mojtabavi . The man behind the mattress is award-winning designer Mehdi Mojtabavi. He says that although it is a very technical design, it also has a power for emotional - and psychological - good. Mr Mojtabavi, an Iranian, writes: 'Embracing is a magical human behaviour, and one that distinguishes us from other animals. 'A loving embrace, especially between partners, is one of the most calming actions. Embracing, and bodily proximity and connection after love-making, are very important for strengthening relationships,' Mr Mojtabavi claims. 'However, what usually stops this pleasant state is not mental tiredness, it is physical weakness.' Although it is a very technical design, it also has a power for 'emotional - and psychological - good' You can wedge your arms and feet in between the pillowy slats. The mattress comes with special sheets . If you tear away from your partner for the night, you can sleep face-down with your toes pointing down . The mattress is still at prototype stage but has won a number of awards since it was first made public in 2007. The Facebook page says: 'Cuddle Mattress lets you hug your better half intimately without any wrist or arm problems. You'll sleep better and you can cuddle longer. 'We all like a little cuddling, but the muscles, blood vessels and nerves in our limbs often pay the price. 'When we do stop cuddling, it's not for lack of desire, but it's because we're physically uncomfortable. Ultimate comfort . The mattress allows you to wedge your arms and feet in between a series of pillowy slats. This may help to better facilitate cuddling. The mattress also comes with specialized fitted sheets, which may help to better facilitate sanitary sleeping conditions. Mehdi Mojtabavi’s innovation is not yet in production. The prototype won a 2007 Red Dot award and was a 2008 Industrial Designers Society of America finalist. Mojtabavi failed to raise £48,000 ($75,000) in start-up money through a crowd-sourced fundraising campaign. He is currently seeking other investors to get his idea on the market.","Divided foam blocks allow partners to spoon without the 'big spoon' suffering a numb limb .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 09:48 EST, 17 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:38 EST, 17 July 2013 . David Cameron was today forced to defend another u-turn as the government ditched plans for minimum alcohol pricing. The Prime Minister had championed the idea of setting unit price to curb cheap booze deals but faced a Cabinet revolt, with senior ministers warning it would hit the poorest people hardest. Multi-buy offers will also not be banned but there will be a ban on the sale of alcoholic drinks priced below the level of duty and VAT, to the fury of some MPs. David Cameron defended the latest government u-turn as he welcomed Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta to Number 10 for talks . It is the latest in a string of policy reversal's ordered by Mr Cameron since he became Prime Minister. The Home Office carried out a consultation on a 45p minimum unit price earlier this year. It would mean a can of strong lager could not be sold for less than £1.56 and a bottle of wine for less than £4.22. The list of government u-turns now runs to more than 40 since the coalition was formed in May 2010. In the early days ministers tried to argue that it was a sign of strength to admit when they got things wrong. But strategists feared too many reversals risked looking weak. Major policies floated and then ditched by David Cameron include: . But today Home Office Minister Jeremy . Browne said there was not enough ‘concrete evidence’ that the move would . reduce the level of problem drinking without hitting people who drink . responsibly. Mr Browne also . ruled out a ban on multi-buy promotions due to a ‘lack of convincing . evidence’ that it would have a significant effect on consumption. The main change which will go ahead will see a ban on selling alcohol below the value of alcohol duty and VAT. It will come into effect in England and Wales by spring 2014 and will mean ordinary strength lager will not be sold for less than around 40p. However, Tory MPs condemned the decision. Backbencher Tracey Crouch said the decision left the UK ‘dangerously . lagging behind’ other countries when it came to public health. Mr Cameron defended the u-turn, coming . days after the government also dropped plans to force tobacco firms to . sell cigarettes in plain packaging. Speaking . in Downing Street the Prime Minister said: ‘We are introducing today . what is effectively a minimum price because we are saying it's going to . be illegal to sell alcohol below the rate of duty plus VAT. ‘So supermarkets or shops deeply discounting alcohol will be made illegal. That, I think, will be a positive step forward.’ Curbs: Minimum alcohol pricing has been dropped but retailers will be banned from selling booze below the cost of duty and VAT . Mr Cameron added that there were arguments with ‘a lot of merit’ in favour of a minimum price but there were also problems. ‘There's . a degree of legal uncertainty - it's been introduced in Scotland but . it's still under legal challenge - and there's also question marks about . the evidence behind it and how well it can work. ‘So, . when we have more evidence about how it can work and when we've got . more certainty about the legal issues I think it's an idea that has . merit, that I'll be happy to consider again.’ He stressed that the decision had been made ‘by me as Prime Minister’, as had the shelving of plans for cigarettes in plain packaging. It follows claims by Labour that new Tory election guru Lynton Crosby, a lobbyist who counts tobacco giant Philip Morris as a client, had influenced the public health policy u-turns. Backlash: Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, a former GP, said doctors wanted to see minimum pricing introduced while Tracey Crouch (right) warned the u-turn would cost lives . But Mr Cameron said: ‘In the end the buck stops absolutely here. These are both decisions that I have made, I think they are the right ones because we need the evidence base, we need the legal certainty and then we can move ahead. ‘But until then it makes sense not to move ahead.’ However in the Commons Tory MPs lined up to criticise the decision to abandon minimum alcohol pricing. Miss Crouch told Mr Browne: 'Scientific studies show a clear positive impact between introducing minimum pricing and alcohol-related deaths. 'Does this not show that the decision to delay minimum alcohol pricing today leaves us dangerously lagging behind in terms of public health policy, which will ultimately cost lives?' Dr Sarah Wollaston, a former GP, said: 'Doctors up and down this country who are fed up with being lectured on how to reduce avoidable mortality within the NHS see the one tool they are asking for that could reduce avoidable mortality in liver disease taken away.' Tory MP Andrew Griffiths was also angry at the decision to drop the policy. He said supermarkets would still be able to undercut pubs which served reputable customers.","Prime Minister had championed setting minimum unit cost price .

"By . David Martosko . PUBLISHED: . 15:47 EST, 17 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:53 EST, 17 April 2013 . The Obama administration is not allocating any significant resources to prevent fertilizer bombing attacks like the one that toppled the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995, a former senior Department of Homeland Security official with direct knowledge of the department's budgeting and operations told MailOnline. In a lengthy interview, the former official said the April 15 Boston Marathon bombing 'tragic', adding 'but if this were an Oklahoma City-type bomb, there would have been hundreds of deaths.' Homeland Security has just one federal employee and no contractors devoted to the task of preventing the deployment and detonation of ammonium nitrate bombs, a situation he called 'completely ineffective, and very dangerous for the country.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS OF AMMONIUM NITRATE'S EXPLOSIVE POWER . The 1995 bombing of the Murrah building in Oklahoma City left wreckage and 168 dead bodies - including 19 children. Like the Boston Marathon attacks, it occurred on Patriot's Day. Unlike Boston, the bomb was composed of ammonium nitrate and combustible fuel . 'If this were an Oklahoma City-type bomb, there would have been hundreds of deaths' in Boston, said a former DHS official. Timothy McVeigh (R) was executed for his part in the 1995 bombing. Terry Nichols (L) got life in prison without the possibility of parole . The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was a political appointee at DHS headquarters. He described the United States' chemical security program as 'disastrous,' and also criticized the decimation of formerly robust grant programs intended to help states and cities prevent attacks like the one in Boston. Two bombs were detonated near the finish line of Monday's Boston Marathon, killing three people and wounding at least 173 others. Robert . Liscouski, a former Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for . Infrastructure Protection, told MailOnline Tuesday that 'the Obama administration has continued to . cut the budget for offices such as the Office for Bombing Prevention . from $20 million started under [George W.] Bush, to $11 million today.' MailOnline did not interview Liscouski for this story. But the source did say that DHS now has just a single federal employee and no contractors assigned to prevent the construction, deployment and detonation of ammonium nitrate bombs like the one Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols used in Oklahoma City. That situation, he said, is 'completely ineffective and very dangerous for the country,' adding in an email that cuts to the Office of Bombing Prevention are 'the tip of the iceberg.' Ammonium nitrate is sold by farming supply retailers, and comes in bags like this one (L), which contains about 1,300 pounds. In 2010, U.S. and Canadian Soldiers disposed of a large cache of the chemical in Kandahar City, Afghanistan in 2010. The blast could reportedly be felt at a distance of 5 miles . Ammonium nitrate is a chemical most commonly found in commercial farming fertilizer. Al-Qaeda has published how-to guides for the construction of bombs using the chemical and diesel fuel. In 2006 ABC News was able to buy a half-ton of the fertilizer for less than $300, without photo IDs, and move it to a warehouse a few miles away from the White House. 'A thousand pounds would take down a good-sized building,' ABC's Brian Ross reported. The Oklahoma City bomb contained about two tons of fertilizer and $3,000 worth of racing fuel. It killed 168 people including 19 children. Terrorists worldwide, including those in India, England, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Indonesia, have used ammonium nitrate because it's stable, providing little risk that they will be killed in accidental explosions. It's also inexpensive and very effective. A 2010 documentary on the TLC network included a test explosion involving two tons of the chemical loaded into a truck and detonated from a safe distance. The images were chilling and devastating. The Department of Homeland Security's website includes a page for the Ammonium Nitrate Security Program, listing public meetings hosted by the agency to discuss regulations governing the program. The last one occurred in November 2011. Another program DHS has 'zeroed out' according to the source who spoke with MailOnline, is the Buffer Zone Protection Program. That initiative was a $50 million grant program that awarded local law enforcement and first responders with funds to 'identify and mitigate vulnerabilities at the highest-risk critical infrastructure sites,' according to DHS. A DHS spokesman did not respond to questions about whether the ammonium nitrate and buffer zone programs were still funded or operational. But an Internet link on the program's Web page, which once led to a Federal Emergency Management Agency website, is no longer functioning. a White House spokesman also did not respond to an email seeking comment. A former senior DHS official faulted the Obama administration for not doing enough to prevent future ammonium nitrate bomb attacks like the one that leveled the Murrah building. Secretary Janet Napolitano (L) told Congress on Wednesday that the Boston bombings did not appear to be part of a larger terrorist plot . Another program about which DHS would not answer questions is the Urban Area Security Grants initiative. Police chiefs, the former official said, are under enormous pressure to fund their own infrastructure protection plans because DHS is gradually taking back hundreds of millions in grant funds that used to be available. Overall, the source said, $3.5 billion in grants to state and local law enforcement were available when President Barack Obama took office, funds that DHS grants for the specific purpose of protecting buildings, roadways, train stations, airports, power plants, reservoirs, urban buildings and other sites from from attack. There are, he estimated, 'hundreds of millions of dollars' less available today. The Lower Manhattan Security Initiative and the Homeland Infrastructure Threat and Risk Analysis Center - once a $25-30 million program - have also seen their funding eliminated, he said, adding that 'major urban areas like Boston are why we created these offices, and they've been degraded to the point of literal nonexistence.' Infrastructure protection, the former official added, is an undersecretary-level position, but it's been turned into a 'backwater' under the Obama administration, because the White House has not taken its function seriously since 2009.","A former high-level Homeland Security appointee says ammonium nitrate bomb prevention program now consists of just one employee .

The chiselled features of Rupert Penry-Jones don’t just turn heads, they set hearts a-flutter and reduce hitherto dynamic, accomplished women to simpering schoolgirls. The towering star of Whitechapel and Silk is lusted after by everyone from the woman next door to the highest paid female TV presenter in the country. According to Maxine Peake, his co-star in legal drama Silk, she can slip into the public gallery at the Old Bailey to research her role unrecognised, but when Rupert once accompanied her, 'Women were cooing and going all gooey over him.' Toff totty: Rupert Penry-Jones will appear in the new series of ITV's Whitechapel which begins this week . And who can forget that embarrassing interview last year on This Morning, when Holly Willoughby, who’s interviewed Hollywood stars, prime ministers and Olympic heroes, stammered, giggled and blushed before finally burying her face in a cushion to mask her discomfort? No, there’s no denying Rupert’s a heart-throb. As his actress wife and former M&S voiceover doyenne Dervla Kirwan might have purred, 'Not just any heart-throb, but Britain’s heart-throb.' Because, while most of his other pretty boy contemporaries have moved to Hollywood, the most handsome home-grown talent on British TV is thankfully still here, gracing our screens for up to six months of the year. We meet on the appropriately creepy set of the fourth series of his horror detective show Whitechapel. The disused Hornsey Town Hall in north London is a former Art Deco masterpiece now full of mysterious dark corridors, strange noises and rumours of ghosts. Rupert, 42, has been doing 12-hour shifts all week, but he strides into the room with a big smile. Happily married: Rupert with his (extremely fortunate) wife Dervla Kirwan . He’s as charismatic and charming as he is handsome, and he’s obviously used to calming down excitable women. 'When an attractive woman finds you attractive and says nice things about you it’s fine,' he says recalling the Willoughby incident. 'Holly’s lovely so I’m not complaining. I didn’t mind at all!' And what does his poor wife make of all the fuss? She is, after all, no shrinking violet, as Rupert revealed recently when he told an interviewer she had a stand-up row with his mother in London’s Wolseley restaurant which became so heated neither woman ate and they left in separate taxis. 'Dervla started so many fundamental . changes in my life, and there’s been no resistance from me. She’s just . the right woman for me, she ""gets"" me. I can be myself with her' Dervla has since said the two women have made up and now have 'a very good relationship'. 'She isn’t threatened, she’s very secure,' Rupert says of the mother of his two children, Florence, nine, and Peter, six. He and the former Ballykissangel star have been together for 12 years, after working on the JB Priestley play Dangerous Corner, and despite all the attention Rupert gets, they appear to have one of the most stable relationships in showbiz. Before he met Dervla, Rupert was something of a playboy – he once dated Kylie Minogue – but he says his marriage calmed him down and the pair recently swapped London for rural Hampshire. Most weekends, he says, they’ll be cuddled up on the sofa with their two children and border collie, Blue, watching a film. Action man: Rupert set pulses racing during his stint in Spooks and once dated popstar Kylie Minogue . Legal eagle: Along with his terrifying turn in Whitechapel, Rupert also stars in BBC drama Silk . 'Dervla started so many fundamental changes in my life, and there’s been no resistance from me. She’s just the right woman for me, she ""gets"" me. I can be myself with her.' Rupert was born of acting stock; his mother is To The Manor Born’s Angela Thorne and his father Howards’ Way’s Peter Penry-Jones. As a dyslexic who left school without any qualifications, acting seemed a natural fit. Rupert was thrown out of the Bristol Old Vic drama school for ‘being a bad influence’ (he argued with his teachers) but still managed to get into the RSC and had a succession of small to middling parts on TV before finding fame in Spooks as Section D’s loose cannon Adam Carter. After leaving the show rather explosively in 2008 there was a brief hiatus when he tried his luck in America. He was picked up to star in a detective drama called The Forgotten and filmed the pilot; but when it was finally commissioned he was replaced by Christian Slater in the lead role. The show still flopped. Making it in Hollywood still remains an ambition, but Rupert’s come to terms with the fact it might never happen. 'Of course, the grass is always greener; you always want to do something else,' he says. 'But I’d be crazy to jack in everything I have here and go. The only way I’d be available to go and work there would be to say goodbye to shows I really like and then, potentially, have nothing. And I can’t do that; I have a family I’m responsible for.' If Spielberg were to call, he adds, he might contemplate a move. Until then he’s enjoying what he has here. Whitechapel was originally envisaged as a one-off series; an intriguing story about a modern day copycat of the Jack The Ripper killings. Rupert plays the super-uptight Detective Inspector Joseph Chandler, who was brought in to solve the case. To everyone’s surprise it was a huge hit and 2009’s highest performing new drama. When we meet, Rupert is filming the fourth series of the ITV show which, he believes, has taken on a life of its own. 'It’s a funny show; it seems to be turning into something we never envisaged. At first you think, ""How many copycat killings can there be?"" But now it’s reinvented itself. 'It’s quite a different beast to the original but we think this will be our best series yet. It’s rare to work on a show that gets better as it goes along but long may that continue. Scary: Even Rupert has felt a shiver run down his spine after watching his crime drama, Whitechapel . 'The writers have brought in elements that relate to the first and second series while it will also focus more on what’s happening in the police station. The show we’re filming today is about witches and in the story all the characters are spooked by it. 'There’s a sense of evil in the station itself. There’s not very much that is real about the show and my character is not the most convincing detective on TV but we enjoy the fact that there’s something a bit ridiculous about it. 'I think what people love about the show is its scary elements. I even get scared watching it. There was an episode last year which had a guy hiding in people’s walls. After I watched it at home – and I couldn’t believe I was doing this – but I made sure every door was locked. I think being scared gives you a thrill; it makes you feel alive.' Rupert also enjoys getting into the idiosyncrasies of his character, who’s a bundle of repression and suffers from OCD. 'It’s fun to have something like that to play with as an actor,' he says. 'I use it to express emotion. I’m constantly trying to find new things for him to do but they can’t be for the sake of it; I wouldn’t want to be disrespectful to people who do have OCD. It can be a horribly debilitating illness. 'I’d say I have it a bit; Dervla definitely would say I have it. I enjoy cleaning and tidying. I’m not quite as bad as David Beckham but I think anyone would have OCD if they lived with my wife. 'Everything has a place in my house and if it’s not put back in the right place, I’m not happy. But I think that’s just sensible. She’s more chaotic. If she had her way, there would be deodorant next to jam – everything in the same cupboard!' 'Of course, the grass is always greener; . you always want to do something else,' he says. 'But I’d be crazy to . jack in everything I have here and go to America' While Whitechapel airs, Rupert will be filming Silk, his big show for rival channel BBC1, in which he and Maxine Peake play two competing but friendly barristers. Both shows also, coincidentally, star veteran actor Phil Davis. who Rupert’s known for over a decade since appearing in North Square – another legal drama by Silk’s writer Peter Moffat. In Whitechapel Phil plays Chandler’s disgruntled No. 2 Ray Miles while in Silk he’s dodgy solicitor Mickey Joy. Unsurprisingly the two have become good friends, bonding over a love of red wine, snooker and Scrabble. 'We have a similar sense of humour and we agree about a lot of things to do with work,' says Rupert. 'We text and ring each other quite a lot; I don’t think we’ve ever had a cross word. It’s one of the great things about becoming an actor that you get to become friends with people from different walks of life.' He’s still ambitious, but for now Rupert seems content to be a leading man on our two biggest TV channels. 'Things are going pretty well and I’m really enjoying this journey,' he says. And then, with a quick smile – but no kiss – the handsome, charming and, as I now know, housework-loving Rupert Penry-Jones leaves the room. Sigh. Whitechapel returns on Wednesday at 9pm on ITV.","Silk actor used to be something of a playboy .

Thousands of cancer patients will lose out when the Government’s special drugs fund for England is wound up next year, claim campaigners. They are appealing to David Cameron to intervene amid fears that access to cancer medicines will revert to being the worst in Europe, with more than 16,000 patients a year denied help. Cancer charities are calling for the Government to confirm that the Cancer Drugs Fund will continue beyond March 2014 to prevent a return to the ‘dark days’ when patients were deprived of life-prolonging drugs on the NHS. The £200million-a-year fund, which began in April 2011, has led so far to 30,000 patients in England being given drugs banned on the NHS by Nice, the rationing body. They are five times more likely to get a new cancer drug than patients in Wales, and three times more likely than Scottish patients. The Government’s aim, which was a Tory election pledge, was to enable NHS doctors to prescribe any drug if they believed a cancer patient could benefit. But it was a stopgap for three years, until a new method of assessment for drug pricing is brought in. Andrew Wilson, chief executive of the Rarer Cancers Foundation which is behind the appeal, said the fund had been highly successful, with ‘dire predictions’ that it could bankrupt the NHS proven to be false. In a letter to the Prime Minister, he says cancer patients face uncertainty because a new way of pricing drugs – value-based pricing – due to come in next year will exclude all the drugs currently provided for patients under the Cancer Drugs Fund. Patients will also be unable to get drugs that are close to being licensed, which is called off-label prescribing. Almost two-thirds of cancer treatments considered by Nice (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) are rejected. It is estimated that ending the fund will prevent more than 16,000 patients annually from getting potentially life-extending drugs. Mr Wilson said: ‘Value-based pricing is due to be introduced at the end of the year but there is no detail on how it will help cancer patients. Helping hand: The Cancer Drugs fund has led so far to 30,000 patients in England being given drugs which would have been banned on the NHS . ‘What we do know is that it will do nothing to help those patients who need drugs currently available through the fund and that, with Nice in charge, we have little confidence that it will be effective for new drugs. Without action now there is a danger that we will go back to the dark days of the postcode lottery. ‘At the last election David Cameron made a promise to cancer patients. That was not just a promise for three years and we urge him to take action to ensure patients can continue to gain access to life-extending drugs.’ In 2011 Carol Murray, 66, a mother of two with five grandchildren, was diagnosed with thyroid cancer too late to have surgery. Mrs Murray, who lives in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, with her husband Vic, 69, ran out of options after radiotherapy failed to work. Her cancer specialist succeeded in getting her a new drug licensed for liver and kidney cancers – but not thyroid cancer – through the fund. After nine months on the drug Mrs Murray feels well and has been able to go abroad on holiday for the first time in three years. She said: ‘I’m not expecting a cure but everybody should get a chance to try a drug for three months to see if it works. ‘We’ve had time together as a family because my life has been extended, but this will no longer be possible for people in my position if the fund does not continue. ‘The drug I’m taking has been licensed now but it wasn’t when I first used it, and that will be stopped in the future.’ Tory MP John Baron, chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on cancer, said: ‘In the absence of detail as to the fund’s replacement early next year, the Government should consider an extension until the new system is established.’","Value pricing will exclude all drugs currently provided by fund .

He has been delighting children and adults alike for 350 years with his unconventional methods of dealing with his wife and child, not to mention policemen, doctors and even crocodiles. But a killjoy tried to bring the curtain down on a Punch and Judy show when he accused organisers of glorifying child abuse. Puppeteer Les Clarke was stunned when an angry member of the audience interrupted his show at Saddleworth High School in Uppermill near Oldham to complain about a violent scene involving Mr Punch and his baby. Stunned: Les Clarke has been holding Punch and Judy shows for 25 years, but only now has he been accused of glorifying child abuse . Mr Clarke, 63, said: 'I was doing my second show of the day when it got to the part of the show where Punch is looking after the baby. 'It’s a knock-about comedy but in my show he doesn’t hit the baby, but it’s part of the fun to think he might. 'All of the kids in the audience shout . out as he puts a bucket on the baby’s head and looks like he is going . to hit it with a club.' That's not the way to do it: A man complained after Mr Punch shoved his baby's head into a bucket and threatened to hit it with a stick . The man, who has not been named, first made a complaint to his partner, Kay Wilson, and then to Rotary officials. Mr Clarke said: 'I couldn’t believe it. I didn’t think the guy could be serious. 'I have been doing it for 25 years and it’s the first response like this I’ve ever had. The earliest recorded evidence of Punch and Judy can be found in the diary of Samuel Pepys. After a visit to Covent Garden in 1662, Pepys wrote: 'Thence . to see an Italian puppet play that is within the rayles there, which is . very pretty, the best that ever I saw, and great resort of gallants.' In the late Victorian era the show evolved into entertainment aimed primarily at children. Ancient members of the cast, . such as the Devil and Punch's mistress Pretty Polly, were written out due to fears they were inappropriate. The term 'pleased as Punch' is derived . from Punch and Judy and comes from Punch’s characteristic sense of . gleeful self-satisfaction. 'The funny thing is that I regularly . do shows for children aged between three and 10 and they always . understand that it is a silly show. It is not real life. They have fun . shouting at Punch and telling him off for hitting everyone. 'They shout ""you shouldn’t be throwing the baby out of the window"" and they find it really funny.” In the section of the show that . caused the complaint, Punch steals the baby’s sausages but then falls . over, which he blames the tot for. He then puts a bucket on the baby’s head and threatens it with a stick. Mr Clarke, a former designer, said: 'I . thought the man was joking when he first complained the puppet was . encouraging child abuse. 'Traditional Punch and Judy shows . have been around for 350 years. Mr Punch chasing the baby is just . part of the show’s heritage. We were speechless.' Rotary Club member Mike . Hall met the complainant. He said: 'I was completely taken by . surprise. I was so astounded I just walked away, shaking my head.' Mr Clarke said he regularly performs at shows, parties and events as well as regular appearances at care homes. He said Punch and Judy shows are more popular now than when he began in the business. He said: 'They are such great fun and . it gives children a live experience away from computers and televisions. It’s a really interactive experience that everyone can enjoy.' Who's a pretty boy then? Certainly not Mr Punch, whose antics caused outrage with one member of the audience at a community fete .","Mr Punch shoves baby's head in bucket before threatening it with stick .

Getting married: Gary Hersham, 60, will be giving away his actress daughter Gabriela, pictured, as planned this weekend . As the founder of one of London’s most exclusive estate agents, regularly selling homes worth in excess of £20 million, burly Gary Hersham has always been a force to be reckoned with in the property market. But despite being fit and a keen tennis player, 6ft Gary was no match for the four thugs who followed him by car as he drove his Mercedes near Marble Arch at the weekend - and then subjected him to a vicious attack the moment he had parked. Three of the men launched themselves at him as he clambered out of his car - he was on his way to meet a friend - grabbing him from behind, punching and throttling him and covering his eyes. They relieved him of his watch and his keys. The fourth remained at the wheel of their getaway car. ‘It was an expensive watch, and of sentimental value. I will be wearing an Accurist from now on,’ says Gary, 60, who will be giving away his actress daughter Gabriela, pictured, as planned this weekend. Typically, the businessman was bloodied but unbowed. Hersham refused hospital treatment despite being left shaken by the incident and suffering a bruised larynx. He was back at work 48 hours later. ‘They must have been following me,’ he tells me. ‘I parked and they stopped their car in the middle of the road. A porter at a block of flats nearby saw what happened and managed to get their number plate, but the police haven’t traced them.’ Urbane Gary, a friend of Ukrainian billionaire Gennadiy Bogolyubov, started his Beauchamp Estates company in Mayfair 35 years ago - he is currently marketing a luxurious ten-bedroom mansion in St John’s Wood for £25 million. And he is refusing to let the mugging affect his plans for his daughter’s wedding. Beautiful Gabriela, 25 - Gary’s child by his first wife, Ada - is marrying her boyfriend of the past two years, French-born hedge fund entrepreneur Antoine Nussenbaum. In a bizarre coincidence, Gabriela’s acting career has often involved her playing roles almost as scary as that of her father’s real-life incident. She is co-starring as a werewolf in the forthcoming horror flick Crying Wolf and has also been filming a pilot for a  U.S. TV series in which she plays a femme fatale thief. Just weeks after I revealed that Tory MP Tracey Crouch had split from her Lib Dem DJ boyfriend Steve Ladner, I gather she is not short of offers from other men. She was in a bar over the weekend - alone, alas, and reading a book - when she was approached by what she describes as a ‘drunk guy harassing me’. She tweeted friends asking whether she should deflect him by pretending to be a lesbian, swearing or leaving. Her colleague, Police Minister Damian Green, advised her to simply tell the truth. ‘Tell him you’re an MP,’ he suggested. It did the trick, but all the more reason for Ms Crouch to find herself a new chap, perhaps. Back to school: Mother-of-four Sian Williams already has a qualification in trauma counselling . Elfin broadcaster Sian Williams made the news herself when she refused to join the BBC exodus to Salford and left the Breakfast programme’s sofa. Now she is raising eyebrows again with a decision to combine her career with reading for a masters degree in psychology at the University of Westminster. The mother-of-four, 48, who turned down Strictly Come Dancing after consulting her children, already has a qualification in trauma counselling. She became interested in the area after reporting on the Asian tsunami in 2004 and the Pakistan earthquake in 2008. ‘Sian hasn’t done any exams for nearly 30 years, but her sons have been helping out with revision tips,’ says a friend. Sian is leaving Radio 4’s Saturday Live show to concentrate on her studies. ‘This is an exciting new chapter for Sian. She will be spreading her wings and taking on a number of new TV projects in the next year,’ adds the friend.

Nicky, 55, who shares his life with fashionista Kelly Simpkin, has bought an Italian scooter to nip between home in St  John’s Wood and the West End. But he complains that wearing a crash helmet on the five-mile journey flattens down his famously flowing hair, making it lose its ‘bounce’. Better than losing your bonce, Nicky. Plan: JCB diggers tycoon Sir Anthony Bamford's wife Carole Bamford is about to open a restaurant near their Gloucestershire home . Newly elevated to the House of Lords, Tory donor and wildly rich JCB diggers tycoon Sir Anthony Bamford will be able to celebrate his investiture in style — at the restaurant his wife is about to open  near their Gloucestershire home. Carole Bamford has spent more than a year overseeing the renovation of the former Tollgate pub in nearby Kingham, hanging its name to The Wild Rabbit. Although she is not the licensee, Lady Bamford has ensured some uniquely personal touches — much of the produce will come from her Daylesford estate and for five years the chef Adam Caisley was her family’s private cook. Caisley previously worked for Michel Roux Jr at the Michelin-starred Le Gavroche and friends say Lady Bamford hopes he might be able to win her a star, too. The hostelry opens next week and will no doubt attract custom from the so-called Chipping Norton set, which includes David Cameron, Jeremy Clarkson and troubled ex-newspaper boss Rebekah Brooks. It is an intriguing development for Lady Bamford. Her Daylesford Organic brand has endured challenging trading conditions. Latest figures from Companies House show the business made a £4.3 million loss at the end of 2011, and the Bamfords state in the accounts that ‘they will provide financial support to enable the company to continue as a going concern’. Chanteuse Cheryl Cole may have endured 15 painful hours having giant roses tattooed on her bottom, but she is not the only one for a penchant for covering her body with artwork. A fan of classical singing group Blake has had her entire torso and both arms inked with the band’s lyrics, along with intricate pictures illustrating each tune. ‘A mother and daughter from Dorset came to one of our gigs a couple of weeks ago and the daughter proudly showed us these tattoos,’ says tenor and former Winchester Cathedral chorister Ollie Baines, 30. ‘They were multi-coloured and all over her upper body, back and arms and she’s considering having our faces done next apparently. It was quite a surprise. ‘The lengths that some fans go to is really rather extraordinary.’ P.S. Proof, surely, that talk of Prince Andrew and Fergie remarrying is just that: Madame Tussauds has no plans to bring their waxworks back. The couple were removed from the attraction years ago. Not that the Yorks have completely vanished. ‘We store in our archives all the moulds, heads and hands of every figure we’ve ever made,’ says head of marketing Nimali Weerasinghe. ‘We have re-cast and updated figures in the past - to date we’ve created 23 figures of the Queen. At this moment, we don’t have plans to create new figures of the Duke and Duchess of York.’","Gary Hersham, 60, followed by four thugs as he drove near Marble Arch .

The Made In Chelsea star had piled on the pounds after indulging in a hard-partying lifestyle. Now the reality show regular has revealed his muscly new look is the result of a week spent dragging logs and lifting tyres at a boot camp in Norfolk run by former soldiers. Scroll down for video . Fat to fit: Spencer has lost a stone thanks to a gruelling fitness regime dreamed up by army instructors . Show off! So thrilled is Spencer with his new look, he couldn't resist showing off for the paps . The old Etonian had gained weight . thanks to his love of late night meals, but decided he wanted to look good for the . new series of Made In Chelsea which starts in the middle of September. Spencer, . 25, was determined not to have a repeat of his return to the show last . year when he arrived on set looking decidedly podgy. Keen to start off on the right foot, he opted for gruelling 12-hour . a day work out sessions with British army PT instructors at the No 1 . Boot Camp in Norfolk. To keep hunger pangs at bay, the star also admitted to using fat burning supplements made from appetite suppressing green coffee beans. Spencer said; 'The Forza Green Coffee . really helped when the rations at the camp were meagre.

Gritty: Spencer looks hot and bothered as he takes part in a training session at the Norfolk boot camp . And heave! Spencer looks pained as he lifts a very heavy looking log during one of the boot camp workouts . And his dedication certainly seems to have paid off, as he managed to drop a stone and now tips the scales at a slimline 13st. Spencer said: 'It’s been a very hard slog getting in shape but No 1 Boot camp don’t let you quit. They had me doing 50 burpees every time I did a fitness session - burpees are a nightmare. 'It’s a squat thrust followed by a star jump. I would suggest very strongly that you don’t try to do 50 in a row.' This is the second time that Spencer has visited the boot camp. He previously went to the Ibiza camp and lost 13lbs but his party lifestyle saw him put most of the weight back on.

A brother and his sister are suing an Ohio hospital after a nurse accidentally threw away a kidney he had donated to save her life. Surgeons at the University of Toledo Medical Center removed the organ from Paul Fudacz Jr. on August 10, 2012 to give it to his then 24-year-old sister Sarah Fudacz - but a nurse, Judith Moore, threw it away as she discarded the contents of a slush machine before the operation was over. Doctors tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate the organ for two hours after the accident was discovered. After consulting with the family, physicians decided not to risk using the kidney because they thought it was likely another compatible donor could be found. Scroll down for video . Mix up: Paul Fudacz, believed to be pictured with his sister Sarah (center) and an unidentified friend (left), donated his kidney to Sarah last year but it was accidentally thrown away by a nurse . The hospital, which found another donor for Sarah and covered her traveling costs so she could undergo the surgery in Colorado, is now trying to dismiss their lawsuit and recover its own costs. Sarah, John, . their parents, and their four siblings filed a lawsuit on July 29 against . UTMC in the Court of Claims in Columbus.They individually demand $25,000, plus interest and the costs of . the suit. Their attorney Jim Arnold said UTMC had been accommodating after the mix up but that the Ohio attorney general’s office, which . represents UTMC, would not accept some of the family's demands. On Tuesday, the medical center responded to the Fudacz family lawsuit, acknowledging the organ was discarded but denying some of the Fudacz . claims, the Toledo Blade reported. Suing: The siblings' parents, Ellen and Paul (pictured), are also named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit . It did not ask the court to dismiss the charge of criminal negligence, but did dispute the family's claim that there was a 'parental loss of consortium' and 'sibling loss of . consortium' - the legal terms for when an incident affects relationships. Surgeon: Dr Michael Rees continues to work at the hospital but two nurses have been fired . There is 'no right to . compensation for parental loss of consortium of an adult,' it said. 'There is no right to compensation for sibling loss of . consortium in a non-death case.' Larry . Burns, the university's vice president for external affairs, said he . did not know how much the medical center paid the family, including the cost of the trip to Colorado. After the mix-up, live-donor kidney transplants . were suspended voluntarily at the medical center - and there was a host of staff changes. Dr. Michael Rees, who performed the surgery, still works at the medical center while two nurses, Moore and Melanie Lemay, no longer work there and the administrator of surgical services, Edwin Hall, was . placed on paid administrative leave. Moore, who threw away the slush machine contents before the surgery was over, resigned on . September 10 last year, while the hospital fired Lemay, a full-time nurse. Lemay, who took over when Moore went on a lunch break, did not update her on . the status of the surgery when she returned from her break, disciplinary records showed, the Blade reported. She has now sued the hospital for wrongful discharge, . defamation, slander, and libel and seeks damages exceeding $25,000. Disastrous error: An investigation is underway at the University of Toledo Medical Center after a nurse . accidentally disposed of a kidney a man donated for his sick sister . Humans do not need two kidneys to live, the body . can support life with only one. If one functional kidney is missing . from birth, the other kidney can grow to reach a size similar to the . combined weight of two kidneys . This kind of accident is unheard of in . organ transplant centers and it was a good decision not to use the . kidney, Dr William Harmon, director of kidney transplantation at Boston .

A conman who convinced 138 people - including his own mother - to part with with a total of £6million in a football syndicate scam has been jailed. Darren Thompson, 40, earned a six-figure salary as a chartered accountant in major city banks  before setting up the 'guaranteed' syndicate, which saw him persuade his own and his wife's relatives, friends and co-workers to plough in hundreds of thousands of pounds. Thompson, who even produced a glossy brochure of fake information that promised 'big returns', was jailed for four years and eight months at Canterbury Crown Court after admitting fraud by false representation. Fraudster: Darren Thompson, 40, was jailed for four years and eight months after admitting conning his friends and co-workers out of hundreds of thousands of pounds to join his 'guaranteed' football syndicate . Thompson's mother gave him £50,000 to put into the syndicate, while his wife Nina-Louise's family lost £300,000. The former City worker earned £150,000 a year at banks including Barclays and Credit Suisse before establishing the European Football Growth Fund in 2004, the court heard. Prosecutor Stuart Biggs told the court Thompson first started betting on Betfair in 2004 and thought he could 'play the system' to make big profits, but that as soon as the syndicate was set up he started losing heavily. Martin Taylor, defending, said Thompson had no previous convictions and . simply got carried away, believing he could claw back money with even . bigger bets. Mr Taylor told the court: 'He believed that these figures were predictable and it was not gambling. 'He had a system and did not consider himself to be a gambler as it was very much a situation where the risk was spread.' Judge Heather Norton, jailing Thomspon for four years and eight months, . told him: 'No doubt your investors were reassured by your background in . football and investment and no doubt too by the glossy brochures which . you provided. 'Unfortunately, indeed tragically as far as your investors were . concerned, by the start of 2007 you could have been in no doubt at all . that this scheme wasn't working.' Thompson convinced ‘high . roller’ colleagues in the City to part with anything from £30,000 to as . much as £600,000 to join his ‘guaranteed’ football betting syndicate. Thompson used dodgy bank statements which indicated the syndicate was making huge returns to help convince people to invest. Proceeds: Thompson scam paid for a lavish Las Vegas wedding for him and wife Nina . But he was actually ‘useless’ at betting, losing between 73 and 91 per cent of all bets staked over a six year period between 2004-2010. The court heard how Thompson had deposited £4.1million into various betting accounts between April 2004 and October 2010. He lost £3million of that money and withdrew just over £1million. The remaining £2million he held back from the accounts, he spent, the court heard. Despite his heavy losses, Thompson . still managed to live a lavish lifestyle, paying for a Las Vegas wedding . to wife Nina-Louise and trips to South Africa and the United Arab . Emirates. He also accumulated a fleet of luxury cars including a Mercedes, a Jaguar, a Porsche and a 4x4. Some . of his victims were forced to remortgage their homes to pay for the . ‘investment’, but were left with nothing after Thompson was snared. One . ‘investor’ lost a massive £600,000, but the average loss was around . £40,000 among more than 100 people - most of them friends he met while . working in London - duped by Thompson. Officers . from the Serious and Organised Crime Unit at Kent Police confirmed the . unit had identified 138 victims of the betting scam. They . said Thompson ‘paid out’ to several investors in 2007, but only so they . would invest more and to give the impression ‘the betting syndicate was . doing well’. Thompson . pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation at Canterbury Crown . Court and was jailed for four years and eight months yesterday. Detective . Constable Stuart Champion said today: 'Thompson abused the trust placed . in him by some of his closest friends and investors. 'He . provided them with fake data and drew up complex documents such as a . declaration of trust to win them over and convince them to put their . money in.

'Some of . their money was invested into bets but they were never successful as . Thompson never made a profit during the time he ran the syndicate.

The jailed mother of tortured Baby P is seeking parole and could be released from prison 'within weeks', it has emerged. Tracey Connelly, 32, has spent just four years behind bars for her role in the death that shocked Britain, and even her own mother said of her bid for freedom: 'She should never come out'. Connelly was jailed indefinitely in 2009 after she admitted doing nothing while her little boy was tortured to death by her boyfriend Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen. Peter was just 17-months-old when he was found dead in his blood-spattered cot at his mother's north London flat, after suffering a catalogue of horrifying injuries including a broken back. Taking into account the time Connelly spent on remand, she has now served her minimum term of five years, and has applied to The Parole Board to have her case reviewed. News of Connelly's possible release was met with horror from Baby Peter's grandmother Mary O'Connor, 63, who said her daughter should remain locked up for life. ‘She should never come out.  But even . if she does I won’t be seeing her again, she’s out of my life,’ she told The Sun.

At the trial, Connelly denied knowing who had caused the injuries to her son. Peter suffered sickening injuries including a broken spine, injured ribs and removed . fingernails - all of which was missed by social service workers. Tortured: Baby P suffered a catalogue of abuse and was found to have a snapped back and broken ribs . Horrific: Paedophile Steven Barker was jailed for life for his role in Baby Peter's death .

Social workers, health visitors and doctors saw the family 60 times before Peter died from his injuries. Sharon Shoesmith, the former children’s services chief at the London borough of Haringey, waged a long battle to clear herself of any personal responsibility for the tragedy. She expressed ‘sorrow’ for Peter’s death, but has never apologised for her role in her department’s failings.

He will be the sole occupant in a complex, 24-foot-long craft made primarily of highly specialised glass foam. The descent will take around 90 minutes and he will spend around six hours at the bottom, filming the attempt for a 3D documentary. A unique Rolex watch will also be journeying to the bottom with Cameron. Rolex sent a watch down with the Trieste in 1960 and produced another timepiece for Cameron's odyssey. It's a complete one-off and not for sale - and is capable of withstanding the extreme pressures of the Mariana Trench - and more - right down to 12,000m. Cameron looks set to beat rival teams to the bottom - Sir Richard Branson's Deep Flight Challenger, and DOER Marine, backed by Google's Eric Schmidt. A Florida company, Triton submarines, are working on a submarine that will take people to the bottom for $250,000 a ticket. 'I've always dreamed of diving to the deepest place in the oceans,' says Cameron. 'For me . it went from a boyhood fantasy to a real quest, like climbing Everest.' 'There is currently no commercial submersible on Earth capable of diving to the ‘full ocean depth’ of 36,000 feet. The only way to make my dream a reality was to build a new vehicle unlike any in current existence,' says Cameron.

Gilbert Broun, the last abbot of the nearby Sweetheart Abbey, is said to have used Abbots Tower as a base for his efforts to reverse the Scottish Reformation in the 16th century. The European Reformation began in 1517 when German monk Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses to a church door in Wittenberg. He rejected the Pope's authority and all of the Church's practices not written in the Bible. His ideas soon spiralled into the Protestant movement, and many Scots were impressed by this when Lutheran books began to appear in their Catholic country in the 1520s. England converted to Protestantism in 1534, before Scotland broke from the Catholic Church in 1560 and banned Mass being held. Abbot Broun fought the reformists, fortifying his abbey and continuing to celebrate Mass there. He was imprisoned, exiled and died in Paris.

Britain is in the grip of a pickpocketing epidemic as Eastern European gangs descend on London ahead of the Olympic Games. A surge in sneak street thefts means more than 1,700 people fall victim every day – an increase of nearly a fifth in only two years, according to official crime  figures released yesterday. At the same time, police warned that professional gangs from Romania, Lithuania and even South America who operate in capitals across Europe are heading to Britain, intent on cashing in on unwitting tourists at London 2012. How they do it: A member of the pickpocket gang approaches a BBC reporter investigating the rise in thefts ahead of the Olympics . Keeping him occupied: The man speaks to the victim on the pretense of needing directions while another gang member approaches from behind . A BBC investigation exposed the . tactics used by Romanian thieves, who were previously operating in . Barcelona, to dupe their victims. The . criminals boasted of their ‘one-second’ theft techniques which leave . targets unaware that anything has happened until  it is too late. They . can make £4,000 a week taking wallets, smartphones and laptop bags. The . goods are then shipped back to Romania and sold on the black market. Scotland . Yard has made more than 80 arrests already and warned thieves the . capital will be a ‘hostile environment’ in the coming weeks. The . Met has even drafted in a team of Romanian police officers to deal with . the problem and patrol in the West End of London and Westminster during . the Games. They will not have arrest powers. Distracted: An accomplice (left) then plays drunk so he can get close enough to the target to strike . Sleight of hand: The 'drunk' man jostles around with the BBC reporter, making it harder for him to notice what is going on . Rich pickings: The sneering thief walks away with the wallet from the unsuspecting victim . Teamwork: The thief quickly hands the wallet to another member of the gang, who spirits it away . Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: . ‘These Romanian officers will prove to be a huge asset in cracking down . on certain criminal networks who are targeting tourists in central . London.’ Official statistics released yesterday showed pickpocketing thefts rose 17 per cent in the past two years. In 2011/12, a total of 625,000 people fell victim, the Crime Survey of England and Wales showed. That is an increase of more than 102,000 since 2009/10. The vast majority of the total are classified as ‘stealth thefts’, but in 83,000 cases the victims’ possessions were ‘snatched’. On the rise: The blue line shows the rise of pickpocketing, increasing 17 per cent compared to 2009/10 figures. The red line shows the rate of household theft . The BBC report showed the first member of a pickpocket gang approaching their victim with a request for directions. Another member of the gang then plays drunk to get close to the target, while taking their wallet or mobile phone. The stolen goods are handed to a third member and quickly spirited away. The thieves told the BBC reporter they were examining online maps of London to help plan escape routes. Detective Inspector Mark Teodorini, the head of Scotland Yard’s Olympics crime team, called for public vigilance. Officers have conducted a series of raids in recent weeks on properties where suspected thieves were living. He said: ‘We know where people are. We know the addresses they are using, we know the vehicles they are using, and we will come through their door very robustly – and if we find anything on them, we will arrest them.’ He added: ‘We won’t always get them in the act but we are trying to disrupt their activity. ‘It is going to be a hostile environment for pickpockets. My advice to them is “don’t bother”.’ Keep them locked: Official figures show thefts from sheds have risen 10 per cent in the last year . Javed Khan, chief executive of Victim Support, said: ‘The rise in pickpocketing, thefts of wallets and unattended bags is worrying and can be the cause of upset for many victims. ‘So we cannot afford to be complacent in the fight against crime.’ In April, a family of Romanian pickpockets who built expensive homes in their home country with the proceeds of thefts from commuters were jailed. The Rostas family targeted up to 1,000 train passengers who slept on late trains leaving London. Five members of the family were jailed for a total of ten years.","Pickpocketing has increased 17% over the last two years .

The sons of Sir Lawrie Barratt have been accused of 'chucking out the peasants' by turfing women and children out of their homes on his former country estate to help settle a £20 million inheritance tax bill. Sir Lawrie combined the role of go-getter tycoon with that of kindly 'squire' of the Daffodil Valley community of Farndale. Under his patronage, the village - on one of the bleakest parts of the North York Moors - blossomed into a thriving community of artists, scholars, musicians, and writers. 'Kindly squire': Sir Lawrie Barratt, who died nine months ago, created a community of scholars, artists and writers at his vast estate in North Yorkshire . But, according to the Sunday Express, barely nine months after the building magnate's death, his legacy is starting to unravel as his heirs start evicting his former tenants and selling their tied cottages for big profits to help with their tax bill. Locals say Sir Lawrie would be 'turning in his grave' if he had any inkling what his sons, Peter and David Barratt, had planned for the estate, which he built up from run-down farms and cottages from 1981. Peter, a millionaire in his own right through his garden centre empire, and David stand to rake in big profits by selling properties rented for £600 a month for up to £380,000. Worried tenants who have found out they have no legal protection are even turning to housing charity Shelter for help as they face homelessness. Many of the properties were in a poor state before the Barratt frontman snapped up the estate for a reputed £1.5million as his regular retreat from the world of big business. Tenants - who were often surprised by the modest terms on which Sir Lawrie offered the 300-year-old cottages - soon found that the businessman's word was his bond and were assured they had nothing to fear by investing in their homes. Threatened: Homes on the Farndale estate are to be sold off after Sir Lawrie's death. He passed the portfolio to his sons Peter and David, who need to raise money to settle an inheritance tax bill . However, the tranquilllty of the Dale has been shattered after many of the tenants were informed Sir Lawrie's sons intended to begin selling some of the properties after each being stung for £10 million inheritance tax on their father's estate, valued at £48 million. One elderly woman whose cottage is being sold from beneath her is said by neighbours to be bed-ridden with health problems. Locals have also complained that David Barratt has also been sighted in the village eyeing up properties which are not even on the hit-list as a future second home for himself and his glamorous American girlfriend. The residents who held mass meetings over the past week have agreed to launch a campaign to save Farndale at the Farndale Village Show tomorrow (Monday). A petition is to be started and donations are already flooding in for a war chest to fund the legal costs of those who decide to stay to fight the eviction notices. The first property to sell has been the cottage which Nicky Hollins and her ten-year-old daughter Ruby moved into six years ago. When Sir Lawrie said yes without even running a credit check it was a dream come true for Nicky - who had been dreading bringing her child up in their home city of Hull. But now the pretty white cottage has been sold subject to survey, ironically to her next door neighbours who are currently away in Africa, and she has to be out by October 17. Popular: Visitors to Farndale in North Yorkshire flock to enjoy the famous display of daffodils . She said in the Sunday Express: 'Sir Lawrie kept this estate together and would not want to see the destruction of what he turned into a thriving community. 'The sons are chucking out the peasants. It is very feudal. They can do what they want I suppose but there should be some moral obligations on them as landlords.' The Barratts own 48 farm houses in cottages in Farndale, about 45 per cent of the village - which nestles in the Yorkshire's own Daffodil Valley. About 50,000 visitors a year flock to the beauty spot to admire the displays of unique flowers said to have planted centuries ago by local monks. Nicky, 42, added: 'People love the Daffodil Walk because it is like stepping back in time and what makes it so authentic is people actually live here.' Initially, 13 of the properties were to be put on the market. But after a storm of protest, this was reduced to seven. However, the tenants believe the cottages will be sold one by one as holiday homes and the community wiped out. The first to be evicted is self-employed artist Flo Watson who has to be out by September 29 along with her children Bella, 12, Minnie, eight, and Obie, four. Her sister Chloe who lives next door with her three children has also been given her marching orders. Flo was born and bred in the area, growing up in the next village, and moved onto the Dale three years ago. 'I felt very secure when I came here. It felt like I was coming home. If they had only given me six months' notice it would have been easier to deal with,' she said. A Shelter spokesman said: 'We aren't able to comment on specific cases such as this, but Shelter's advice may be helpful to some of the residents in this case.' A spokesman for Strutt & Parker, the estate agent acting for the sale of properties on the Farndale estate, said: 'Our clients are continuing to try to come up with options and solutions. 'The current situation is that only four occupied properties are going to be sold along with three vacant ones.' Local Thirsk and Malton Tory MP Anne McIntosh called the situation 'difficult' and pledged to work to find a solutiuon.","Late squire of Farndale Estate in North Yorkshire would be 'turning in his grave' over actions of sons David and Peter .

She has already taken the unprecedented decision to use her mother rather than a nanny to help look after Prince George for the first few precious weeks of his life. Now The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the Duchess of Cambridge – with her husband’s approval – is setting aside a ‘granny flat’ at the couple’s 21-room Kensington Palace apartment so that Carole Middleton can stay and be on hand. The lavish apartment is currently undergoing a £1 million renovation and it is understood that a suite  of rooms within it is being created with Carole and her husband Michael in mind. The Duke, Prince William and Duchess of Cambridge, Catherine with their son, Prince George in the garden of the Middleton family home in Bucklebury, Berkshire, England. Believed to comprise two bedrooms, a bathroom, a sitting room and a dining area, the suite will allow Kate’s parents to stay at a moment’s notice. The move suggests that Carole’s influence on the upbringing of the young Prince will continue for some time to come. The Middletons already own a £1.2 million apartment less than two miles away from Kensington Palace in addition to their £4.5 million pile in Bucklebury, Berkshire. But the rooms at the Palace are set to give them additional privacy and security when they wish to visit their first grandson. ‘Separate living space is being made available for Carole and Michael Middleton within Kensington Palace for when they come to stay,’ said a source familiar  with the new layout of the Palace apartment. ‘The guest area will allow Carole and Michael to be near Kate whenever possible. William is really pleased they will be close by – he really is behind the idea.’ Breaking tradition: Carole and her husband Michael, left, will have their own space at the Palace . The Duke and Duchess’s apparent willingness to allow Carole to stay at their home is the latest in a series  of ground-breaking moves by the couple, who appear to be determined not let Royal tradition dictate how they raise their family. After George’s birth at the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s in Paddington last month, the Middletons were the first to visit the hospital, arriving ahead of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall. William also insisted on driving his wife and newborn son home from the hospital himself. Days later, Kate moved back to the Middleton family home in Bucklebury, where she received only a few relatives and friends. Last week, the first official pictures of Prince George were released to the media – they were taken by Michael Middleton rather than a Royal photographer. Kate and George are scheduled to leave Bucklebury next month when the Palace refurbishment is complete. The Duchess and her mother have taken a keen interest in the decoration of the apartment, overseeing every detail of the interior design. The 21 rooms are arranged over four floors. ‘Kate has obviously been really engaged in the whole thing and she has good taste,’ said the source. ‘The apartment is absolutely  beautiful. It is mainly decorated  in neutral tones but with lovely  textures and furnishings.’ A spokesman for the Duke and Duchess of . Cambridge played down the significance of the work, saying there is no 'Middleton family annex'. A source added: 'Of course there is somewhere . for them to stay when they visit'. Home sweet home: The work is part of the renovations to the 21-room apartment that will be the couple's first proper home together . The apartment was previously occupied by Princess Margaret until her death in 2002. The apartment’s extensive overhaul has included the fitting of new wiring, the removal of asbestos and the replacement of a large section of roof. The £1 million bill is being met  by taxpayers, while the expensive interior redecoration has been paid for privately. Prince William is due to complete his posting at RAF Valley in Anglesey in mid-September, although he has not announced the exact date he  will leave. Sources say that the owners of the cottage William and Kate occupied during their time in North Wales are keen to move back in.","Two-bedroom flat is being furnished for the Middletons complete with bathroom, sitting room and dining room .

A central New York maintenance worker duped out of a winning $5 million scratch-off ticket will get his money next month, seven years after being scammed out of the jackpot, state lottery officials said on Thursday. The Gaming Commission has verified that the ticket belongs to Robert Miles of Syracuse, officials at the agency said. He's expected to receive his jackpot within the next couple of weeks. Miles bought the ticket bought in October 2006 at a Syracuse convenience store owned by Nayef Ashkar. Owed: Robert Miles, left, talks with his lawyer outside court as they arrive for the sentencing of the men who scammed him out of a $5m lotto ticket in Syracuse, New York . Ashkar's two sons, Andy and Nayel, convinced Miles the ticket only was worth $5,000 and paid him $4,000 for it, authorities said. The brothers waited until 2012 to claim the jackpot, prompting an investigation by lottery officials. Andy Ashkar, 35, of Camillus was sentenced five weeks ago to up to 25 years in prison for possessing the stolen ticket. He and Nayel, now 37, were cleared of conspiracy charges this year but Andy was found guilty of possessing stolen property. Their father pleaded guilty this month to filing a false instrument, admitting he lied in a state lottery affidavit. Miles came forward last year after lottery officials announced that the Ashkar brothers had the winning ticket. During the siblings' trial, Miles testified that he was addicted to crack cocaine when he bought the ticket and was confused by what had happened to him when the Ashkars took it. In 2008, Miles filed for bankruptcy. Scam: Brothers Nayel, left, and Andy Ashkar have been found guilty of trying to cheat a lotto winner out of his big prize at their father's store . Miles, who works at a Syracuse apartment complex, couldn't be reached for comment. His lawyer told The Post-Standard of Syracuse that Miles was given the news this week and was 'elated the lottery prize has finally been awarded to him'. The winning ticket for the $5,000,000 Extravaganza scratch-off game originally would have been paid out as a $250,000 annuity over 20 years, Gaming Commission officials said. But because of a change implemented by the lottery this year, Miles will have the option of selecting a lump-sum payment of $3,210,000 that would yield $2,124,378 after taxes.","Robert Miles of Syracuse, New York will receive his millions in the next few weeks ."

Britain's biggest water company paid no corporation tax last year despite imposing inflation-busting price rises on millions of customers. Thames Water made profits of £549million last year after sales rose six per cent to £1.8billion.But the Australian-backed group, which serves nine million customers in London and the Thames Valley, paid nothing in corporation tax – and even received a £5million tax credit. It comes after Jonson Cox, head of regulator Ofwat, said bumper profits and complex company structures that help reduce tax were ‘morally questionable’. Martin Baggs, chief executive officer, of Thames Water, says tax payments are being delayed while Thames Water invests in infrastructure . Earlier this year Thames Water was embroiled in a scandal after it emerged the group financed some of its operations through the Channel Islands. It also provoked fury last year by imposing a two-month hosepipe ban in April, despite England receiving record rainfall in the period. The company’s annual report, published yesterday, showed its boss Martin Baggs received £1.1million in pay and perks for the year. The chief executive saw his basic pay rise £25,000 to £450,000 and also received a bonus of £274,000. He will receive a further £366,000 next month under the group’s long-term incentive scheme. Precious: Annual bills for customers have jumped by 15 per cent, well above inflation . The report revealed water leaking from the group’s pipes rose to 646million litres a day. Sewer floods increased 55 per cent to 549 times. The group ranked bottom of Ofwat’s table of customer service levels last year. The company is owned by Kemble Water Holdings, and its main investors are controlled by Australia’s Macquarie bank. Its customers saw their bills rise by 6.7 per cent last year. They face another crippling hike in rates, with a 5.5 per cent increase due later this year. Mr Cox said some privately-owned water firms avoided taxes by using complex structures to push money abroad. ‘At the same time, hard-pressed customers have seen annual bills rise by 13.5 per cent since 2010, while their incomes have fallen,’ he said. He added: ‘Tax policy is not for an economic regulator and these structures may be legal and common in private equity. ‘But some aspects are morally questionable in a vital public service.’ Thames Water said its tax bill was reduced because of the amount it spends every year plugging pipes and improving drains. It spent £1billion on this last year, allowing it to whittle down its taxes. It also used tax losses from other parts of the group to reduce its bill even further. The group also spent £400million in interest payments for its £8.4billion debts, and paid £231million to shareholders in dividends during the year. Mr Baggs said: ‘We have not paid much corporation tax in recent years because the Government’s tax system allows us to delay, not avoid, payment of tax based on how much we invest. ‘Because we are investing £1billion a year from 2010 to 2015, more than any water firm in the UK’s history, we are able to defer a lot of tax payments to future years. ‘Thames Water contributes around £150million annually in other tax, including business rates and national insurance.’","Thames Water made more than half a billion pounds last year .

Booker, who's campaigning for a seat in the U.S. Senate, hasn't publicly admitted that T-Bone is a fictional character. When a number of media outlets began questioning the character's authenticity several years ago, Booker assured that T-Bone was '1,000 percent real' but eventually stopped mentioning him in stump speeches. Rutgers University history professor Clement Price, who calls himself a friend and mentor to Booker, says the mayor stopped talking about T-Bone after a conversation they had in 2008. Price told National Review that he confronted Booker about the storied drug dealer and that Booker admitted T-Bonewas a 'composite' of people he had met while living in Newark. 'There was no pushback. He agreed that was a mistake,' the professor said. Prior to Booker's unofficial moratorium on T-Bone stories, the drug dealer was fixture in his stump speeches. The stories painted the picture of a troubled black man who grew up on the streets of Newark and whom Booker had been compelled to befriend. 'I still remember my first month on the street,' he told Stanford’s alumni magazine in 2001 about the few weeks that he spent living in a housing project to draw attention to the plight of the people there. 'I walked up to this charismatic black guy my age called T-Bone, who was one of the drug lords,' Booker recalled. 'I just said, ""Yo, man, wha’s up."" And he leaped in front of me, looked me right in the eye and said, ‘Who the blank do you think you are? If you ever so much as look at me again, I’m going to put a cap in your ass.""' Booker, left, speaks with Sean Cleary, 24, of Hillsdale, N.J. on Wednesday, Aug. 14, 2013 at the Hoboken PATH Station in Hoboken, N.J. Six years later, he told a group at Yale Law School about watching T-Bone 'operate this street-level drug trade.' He said T-Bone once asked him to go for a ride with him and during the drive, he found himself 'trying to counsel this guy to turn himself in.' 'He looks at me hard and begins to tell me about his life story. And some of what shocked me and silenced me is that he told me the exact same life story, up until the age of 12 or 13, as my father. Exactly the same. 'Both of them were born in extreme poverty, both of them were born to a single mother who could not take care of them. Both of them were taken in by their grandmothers, but they were both too rambunctious for their grandmothers to handle, and by the age of 10 they were turned out onto the streets.' In telling his story, T-Bone grew emotional and burst into tears 'sobbing into [Booker's] dashboard,' the mayor explained. For now, T-Bone remains a bit of a mystery. Booker spokesman Kevin Griffis cryptically told National Review when asked about the issue: 'I think your questions have been answered a long time ago.'","Booker has used tales about the .

A bus driver in Gulfport, Florida made a desperate call for help as he witnessed three teens brutally punch and stomp a younger student and won’t face charges despite video that shows he did not physically intervene. Pinellas County driver John Moody, 64, put in a call to his dispatcher as he watched three 15-year-olds attack a 13-year-old, breaking the boy’s arm and leaving him with two black eyes. ‘You gotta get somebody here quick, quick, quick, quick,’ Moody could be heard pleading in surveillance footage as the victim moaned with each kick and punch. 'They are about to beat this boy to death.' Scroll down for video [WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT]... Helpless? John Moody radioed for help but did not intervene as three boys, all 15, aboard his Gulfport, Florida school bus savagely beat a 13-year-old on July 9 . The 18-year veteran did not try to stop the attack himself, which led Gulfport Police Chief Robert Vincent to pursue criminal charges. ‘There was clearly an opportunity for him to intervene and or check on the welfare of the children or the child in this case, and he didn't make any effort to do so,’ Vincent told WFLA. However, Moody was not required to help the beaten boy under Pinellas County rules. While some jurisdictions completely ban a driver from stepping in when fights occur, the Florida county merely allows a driver to do so if he or she feels it is safe. Savage: The controversy began when footage taken from a student's cell phone showed the brutal beating and Moody not helping . 'Quick, quick, quick!': Gulfport Police Chief Robert Vincent initially accused Moody of neglect, but video shows he followed protocol by asking dispatchers to get to the scene . Charged: Three 15-year-olds, including Julian McKnight (left) and Lloyd Khemradj (right), are now charged in the savage school bus attack caught on tape that left a younger victim with a broken arm . Additional charge: Joshua Reddin is also charged with unarmed robbery for allegedly stealing the victim's money . Moody followed protocol, say officials, by radioing for help. ‘Please get somebody here quick. There's still doing it,’ Moody said in footage from the scene. ‘There's nothing I can do.’ In fact, Moody says he was traumatized by the event  and has since retired. ‘I had many sleepless nights,’ he told CNN. ‘I had nightmares.’ Moody described the fight and subsequent controversy as the ‘final straw…and it was a big straw, too.’ ‘Me jumping in the middle of that fight with three boys,’ he told CNN, ‘it would have been more dangerous for other students on the bus for as myself. There's just no telling what might have happened.’ Police say the victim was targeted because he was offered marijuana by one of the attackers and then reported the attempted drug sale to school administrators. In spite of this, all the boys were allowed to board the bus together, which Moody’s attorney says points to a problem at the school. 'Stop!': Footage from the July 9 attack shows Moody yelling at the attackers to stop and repeatedly asking dispatchers for help . Brutal: The 13-year-old victim walked away with two black eyes and a broke arm . Nightmarish: Pinellas County, Florida school district rules allow a bus driver to intervene in a fight but does not require them to. Moody, 64, says the attack has left him with nightmares. He retired two weeks following the fight . ‘School officials let these two boys back on the bus, or let them on the bus, and Mr. Moody had no idea what had happened at the school,’ Frank McDermott said. Now the three accused attackers are charged with felony aggravated battery. One of the boys is also charged with unarmed robbery, having allegedly stolen the victim’s money during the attack. McDermott says his client deserves an apology from local Gulfport police.","Veteran Gulfport, Florida school bus driver John Moody says there was nothing he could do .

Attorney Thomas Lowe had a six-month relationship with the woman he was representing in a divorce case. The 58-year-old, who is married, began an affair with his client after complimenting on her appearance and talking about her sex life. Illicit affair: Minnesota attorney Thomas Lowe, 58, has been suspended from practising law after he had a sexual relationship with a vulnerable client... and billed her for the time . The pair embarked on an affair and met up on numerous occasions to have sex. Documents obtained from Lowe's office in Burnsville, Minnesota revealed that on the dates he was having sex he billed the women for his time and coded their liaisons as 'meetings' or 'drafting memos'. Lowe, from Eagan, Minnesota, eventually broke off the affair after several arguments with the woman in a bid to save his own marriage. He also withdrew as her attorney leading to the woman, who had past abuse and mental health issues, to try and kill herself. While she recovered in hospital she told authorities about the affair. Lowe initially denied having the affair, but later 'unconditionally admitted the allegations' to the Office of Lawyers Professional Responsibility. The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled on January 10 that he be suspended indefinitely and lose his license to practice law. Coining it in: Billing documents from the lawyer's office in Burnsville, Minnesota coded the times he was having sex with his client as 'drafting memos' Documents obtained by the Pioneer Press revealed that Lowe first met with the woman in August 2011 to discuss her possibility of representing her in a divorce.

Their affair began the following month and lasted until March 2012 when Lowe ended the relationship. It is not the first time Lowe has been in trouble, according to the Pioneer Press. In 1997, he was placed on probation for buying cocaine from a client. Lowe will be able to apply for his license to practice law after a minimum of 15 months.","Attorney Thomas Lowe had six-month relationship with woman he was representing in divorce case .

Ofcom then held an auction for companies to bid to use other parts of the spectrum from 800MhZ to 2.6GHz . O2 purchased 800MHz lots and Vodafone won both 800MHz and 2.6GHz lots.

The service currently covers 95 cities and tariffs start at £15 for just internet data, or £21 a month for the voice calls and data package on a SIM-only package. Take-up of EEs superfast services, which are priced 10-20 percent more than the equivalent 3G tariffs, reached 687,000 in July. The company is targeting 1 million customers by the end of the year.

The spectrum was released to the company in May and the network was approved by Ofcom earlier this week. Ronan Dunne, CEO of Telefónica UK which owns O2 said: 'Digital connectivity will be made ubiquitous by 4G and become the oxygen of modern life. For the typical user, download speeds of initial 4G networks should be at least five to seven times faster than those of existing 3G networks .

A drag artist who dazzled audiences when he took to the stage as his alter ego Betty Swollocks has been ordered to pay back thousands of pounds in benefits. Brighton man John Townend cheated nearly £7,000 from the taxpayer during a four-year period after convincing the authorities he had no income. But on Friday and Saturday nights, the 62-year-old could be found strutting his stuff on the stage of the Poison Ivy bar in the city centre. Scroll down for video . Alter ego: John Townend claimed he had no income while working as a drag artist under his stage name of Betty Swollocks . He appeared at Brighton Magistrates’ Court yesterday charged with four counts of dishonestly making a statement he knew to be false for the purpose of obtaining housing and council tax benefit. The charges related to offences between November 2007 to September 2011. In total he claimed £5,870.76 in housing benefit plus £980.83 in council tax benefit. He pleaded guilty to all the charges. Townend - who was summoned to court under his real name and his stage name Betty Swollocks - was earning £25 a night plus free drinks at the Poison Ivy in Brighton. He also worked at the Queen's Arms in the city. Len Batten prosecuting told the court that Brighton and Hove City Council received a referral in October 2011 as it was suspected that Townend had not declared his income as a ‘cabaret artist called Betty Swollocks’. Suited: Townend (left) ditched his dress for a more sombre looking pinstripe suite when he appeared at court. Right, Townend as Betty Swollocks . Drag act: Townend would light up the stage when he appeared as his alter ego Betty Swollocks. Right, he was a regular at the Poison Ivy . Mr Batten said: ‘He said he had no income and was waiting for a redundancy payment. He said he was paid cash-in-hand from May to July 2011.' He added his client had been expecting a redundancy payment of about £1,200. Mr . Batten argued the council wrote to the Queen's Arms in George Street, . Brighton, which provided invoices from April 2007 to September 2011. All of them were signed by either John Townend or Betty Swollocks. Townend had a website devoted to his alter ego Betty Swollocks, which has since been removed. Mr Batten said Townend was interviewed under caution July last year and showed ‘a good understanding of the benefits system’. He originally said that he had declared his work at the Queen's Arm's, but later retracted his statement, claiming he was confused as to whether he was employed or self-employed. Details obtained from the Poison Ivy in Brighton showed Townend was paid £25 cash-in-hand on a self-employed basis for performing his act on Friday and Saturday nights. Free drinks were also included in the deal. Defending, Jenna Threadgold claimed Townend ‘wasn’t aware’ he was committing an offence. Miss Threadgold said: ‘What he says is that he did have some work, it was sporadic and was only paid £25. ‘He is not someone who is earning a substantial amount of money. He has health problems and didn’t work for eight months. ‘During this time he was homeless and living in hostels. He has been on a very limited income. Busted: An investigation revealed Townend could be seen regularly strutting his stuff on the dressed as his alter ego Betty Swallocks . ‘He was telling someone but he told the wrong organisation. When he went to sign on with the Department of Work and Pensions he did told them when he did a bit of work. ‘He should have been telling the council as well, he thought it was one organisation.’ Miss Threadgold told the court Townend had ‘mobility problems’ and had mobility aids in his home due to having screws in his hips. She said he has now employed an accountant to help him keep up with his self employment and is ‘remorseful and embarrassed’ about the situation. The case comes just over a week after another transvestite was jailed after claiming he was disabled and pocketing £88,000 in benefits while performing as the star of a drag act called Glitterlips. Mark Hawthorne, 49, said he could barely walk and needed around the clock care to help him get out of bed in order to receive disability handouts for almost a decade. Just over a week ago: Drag queen Mark Hawthorn, left, 49, arriving at Stafford Crown Court to be sentenced for claiming disability benefits while performing as Tilly in drag act Glitterlips, right . By night, however, he adopted the stage name Aunt Tilly and would strut his stuff in nightclubs to Tina Turner and Diana Ross songs as part of a double act. He was caught out when fraud investigators discovered a video of him in action in a blonde wig, high heels and a cocktail party dress, which had been uploaded on YouTube and Facebook. Hawthorne was jailed for six months at Stafford Crown Court after admitting three counts of failing to notify the Department of Work and Pensions of a change of circumstances and two counts of fraud. Townend, who appeared in court wearing a smart pinstripe suit, has started to pay back the £6,856 he owes at £40 per month for the council tax benefit, and £15 per month for the housing benefit. He is currently receiving a pension and benefits. He was handed a community order by magistrates to undertake 120 hours of unpaid work over 12 months. He was also asked to pay £500 prosecution costs. The investigation was said to have cost £1,606.

They were the bread and butter cars of British family motoring during the 1970s and ‘80s and still remembered nostalgically by millions– yet today they are an endangered species. But a generation of popular cars that once dominated the nation’s highways and kerbsides – with evocative names like Allegro, Montego, Maestro, Marina and  Maxi - are now on the brink of extinction. Some were called Princesses. Others like the Austin Metro - successor to the Mini and named by its workforce - were driven by one. The Hillman Imp is fading into obscurity, with just 906 in existence today, the report found . Despite its sleek-looking front, the Rover SD1 has just 310 lucky owners now . Morris Ital 1.3 HL. Introduced in 1980, the Morris Ital was available with the 1275cc A-plus engine or the 1700cc O-series engine . Yet, for example, only 174 Morris Itals are left of the 175,247 that were built. And some models fare even worse. For unlike their sportier siblings of the same era all but a few die-hard fans are maintaining them fit  for the road. The fascinating details of a dying breed that will rekindle memories for millions of mums and dads who remember them from their own childhoods are revealed today in a new analysis by car industry expert Honest John and his website classics.honestjohn.co.uk . The analysis of cars built before 1995 reveals that  when measured and ranked as as a proportion of the total of each model built, 1980s cars have disappeared from roads faster than any others. But while some may mourn  that so few are left, others with less rose-tinted spectacles and memories  of  the era of poor car quality and motor industry strikes epitomised by union militants like Derek ‘Red Robbo’ Robinson, may wonder instead that any of them have survived at all. The Austin Ambassador's classic design was a eye-catching in its day, and it now turns heads because it's such a rare sight . Sight for sore eyes: The MG 1300 is one of the most endangered cars on British roads today . Dying breed: Austin Metro was the successor to the Mini and named by its workforce . The Austin Allegro is highest on the list of endangered cars with just 0.0453 per cent of those even built still being driven today. Famed for its square or ‘quartic’ steering wheel, of the 642,340 Allegros built between 1973 and 1982, just 291 remain today. Though by its fans and owners’ group, the report says it marks the point at which ‘British Leyland lost the will to live.’ The Allegro is followed by such evocative names as the Austin Montego (just 296 remain), the wedge-shaped  Austin Princess (121),  Hillman Avenger (369) , and the classic Vauxhall Viva (1,057), Morris Marina (674), Austin Maxi (401), Morris Ital (174), the ground-breaking and futuristic looking Rover SD1 (310), and the  Vauxhall VX series including  the Victor and Ventora. Fewer than 1,000 (995) are still around. Next in the  endangered list comes the popular Austin Metro which enjoyed celebrity status as Princess Diana's car when she married Charles in July 1981  - just 1,930  of the 1.5 million built  between 1980 and 1981 survive today. A classic: Of the 642,340 Allegros built between 1973 and 1982, just 291 remain today . The wedge-shaped Austin Princess has just 121 left in existence after owners switched to more modern models . The report warned that 1980s cars are particularly vulnerable because their passage into popular classic status is yet to happen and their disappearance has been hastened by needless scrappage . There are a mere 401 Austin Maxi's left on Britain's roads today - and signal the end of the era of 1980s cars . Then there’s the legendary  Ford Cortina which most recently had its moment of fame as a star of retro Sweeney-style police drama ‘Life on Mars’ set in the 1970s and which has fared slightly better with 5,411 still around – but still only 1.13 per cent of the  4.15million built  tin the 20 years to 1982. Next is the MG 100 and 1300 (206 survive), the Austin Maestro (1,012), the polular Vauxhall Chevette (768), Austin Ambassador (just 84), the cute Hillman Imp with an engine that used to blow (906),  Rover 200 (1,371), and the Triumph Acclaim (488). Propping up 20th place is the infamous ‘jelly-mould’ Ford Sierra of 1982-93 of  which some 15,282 remain out of a total run of 3.47million  or 0.44 per cent. The HonestJohn.co.uk report notes: ‘The 1980s may have enjoyed a fashion and pop revival but cars from that decade are some of the most endangered cars on British roads today. Many of UK's once-popular family cars are on the verge of disappearing completely.’ It notes: ‘The Austin Metro is typical. It was once a common sight on British roads and enjoyed celebrity status as Princess Diana's car when she married Charles in July 1981. The Morris Marina is under-appreciated, with only 674 left in the care of owner today. Many of UK's once-popular family cars are on the verge of disappearing completely . A 1983 Vauxhall Chevette may have been popular at the time, but the amount on the roads has dwindled to 768 . Nippy run around: The Austin has fared a little better, with 1,012 in existence . The legendary Ford Cortina most recently had its moment of fame as a star of retro Sweeney-style police drama 'Life on Mars' set . ‘It was also the driving school car of . choice for BSM, and everyone knew someone who had one – and now, there's . a mere 823 Austin Metros, from an original production run of 1.5 . million between 1981-1991.’ The report adds: ‘The once-derided Austin Allegro has suffered the largest decline of all, with just 291 remaining in the UK at the end of 2011, from a total production run of 640,000 between 1973 and 1982. ‘The Ford Cortina is another model on the list that may raise a few eyebrows. After all it was Britain's best-selling car between 1973 and 1980. ‘Once upon a time, it was the darling of a million sales reps – but it most recently had its moment of fame as the star of  the TV drama Life on Mars. Just 5,411 remain registered in the UK, from more than four million built.’ But while all top 20 cars on the ‘Most Endangered List’ have a survival rate of less than 1 per cent,  some classic cars at the other end of the scale had impressive survival rates. The Lotus Elan emerges as the UK’s most popular classic car with 38 per cent of its pre-1995 models (3,361) still surviving today. It is followed by the Triumph Stag with a quarter (25%) of those built between 1970 and 1977 (6,466) still around. The sporty Reliant Scimitar is in third place with more than  one in 5 (21.2 per cent) of ther total satill around (3,240) Keith Adams, editor of Honest John Classics said: 'This list of endangered cars is fascinating – pretty much all of them littered the UK roads as recently as 10 years ago and now you’ll be lucky to spot them at a classic car meeting. ‘The low survival rate for these models is shocking. 1980s cars are particularly vulnerable – because their passage into popular classic status is yet to happen and their disappearance has been hastened by needless scrappage and artificially low market values in recent years.' Mr Adams added: ‘If you're a fan of unloved 1990s family cars, the read 'em and weep - for they are going fast. If you want one, be quick before they're all gone!’ The ‘Top 20 Endangered Cars’ research by Honestjohn.co.uk was created by examining DVLA records of classic cars registered between 1950 and 1995 to find out how many were still registered today – both legally on the road or having been  registered as being off the  road compared to the amount originally built.

Family man: Bernard Gallacher (pictured with his wife Lesley and daughter Kirsty) was last night fighting for his life after suffering a suspected heart attack . Golf legend Bernard Gallacher was last night fighting for his life in hospital after suffering a suspected heart attack. The Ryder Cup-winning captain was on a visit to Aberdeen when he complained of feeling ill and suddenly collapsed on Thursday night. The 64-year-old Scot, who led the European golf team to victory over America in 1995, was last night described as being in a ‘critical’ condition at the city’s Royal Infirmary. His daughter, Sky Sports presenter Kirsty Gallacher, is believed to be at his bedside with her mother Lesley, brother Jamie and sister Laura. Gallacher had recently flown back to the UK from a family holiday in Spain and was due to make an after dinner speech at an event in Aberdeen. The Daily Mail understands he has undergone a procedure to insert a stent into an artery and is presently in a coma. An NHS Grampian spokesman confirmed Mr Gallacher was being treated in hospital and was ‘in a critical condition’. Mr Gallacher’s nephew Stephen, who pulled out of the Wales Open during his second round on Friday morning, said: ‘I understand that he is critical but stable. ‘My family is in disarray at the moment and it is obviously a worrying situation. We are all anxious.’ George O’Grady, chief executive of the European Tour, said: ‘We are in touch with  Bernard’s wife Lesley and the Gallacher family and, obviously, we join with everyone in wishing Bernard a speedy recovery.’ Gallacher, who lives in Ascot, Berkshire, played in the Ryder Cup eight times and was non-playing captain of the European Team in 1991, 1993 and 1995. Star: Gallacher had recently flown back to the UK from a family holiday in Spain and was due to make an after dinner speech at an event in Aberdeen . He lost the first two competitive clashes but led the European side to a stunning victory on American soil in 1995 when they beat America by 14½ to 13½ points at the Oak Hill Country Club in Pittsford, New York. A child prodigy, he began playing golf when he was just 11 years old and won the 1967 Scottish Amateur Open. Legend: Gallacher played in the Ryder Cup eight times and was non-playing captain of the European Team in 1991, 1993 and 1995 . He turned professional in the same year and in 1969, at the age of 20, became the youngest player to represent Great Britain and Ireland in the Ryder Cup up to that time. Gallacher also recorded his first win as a professional that year, taking the PGA Championship title. Between 1974 and 1984 he accumulated another ten wins on the European Tour and also finished in the top ten on the European Tour Order of Merit five times between 1972 and 1982. He later joined the European Seniors Tour, winning the Mobile Cup in 2002 and has also been a regular golf commentator on BBC Radio Five Live. He was made an OBE in the 1996 New Year’s honours list. Kirsty Gallacher, 37, had been on holiday in Spain with her parents and returned to the UK with her family – the mother of two is married to rugby player Paul Sampson – to attend a 60th birthday celebration for golfer Sam Torrance. Gallacher and his wife Lesley are believed to have remained  in Spain for a couple more  days to finish their holiday before flying back to the UK this week. It is not known whether he is in a medically-induced coma and there are no further details of his condition.","Bernard Gallacher was on trip to Aberdeen when he collapsed on Thursday .

Earlier this year, the National Trust launched a £1.2million appeal to buy an almost mile-long section of the landmark from a private owner. It already had parcels of land either side, and the successful purchase gives the charity stewardship of five miles of Kent coastline, from its visitor centre above Dover port to South Foreland lighthouse. 'Saved': The National Trust has bought a mile-long stretch of the White Cliffs of Dover from a private owner after launching a £1.2million fundraising appeal . Groundswell of support: More than 16,000 people and organisations have backed the appeal, which was launched in June and saw an average donation of £40.21, including Gift Aid, from members of the public . The 360ft cliffs are home to an astonishing variety of flora and fauna. More species can be found in a square metre of the chalk grassland than a tropical rainforest. More than 16,000 people and organisations have backed the appeal, which was launched in June and saw an average donation of £40.21, including Gift Aid, from members of the public. A host of celebrities, including Dame Judi Dench, singer Joss Stone, chef Rick Stein offered their support to the campaign, which has reached its target in just 133 days. It was also backed by Dame Vera Lynn, who sang the wartime classic (There’ll Be Bluebirds Over) The White Cliffs of Dover that became synonymous with the landmark. A significant donation from the Dover Harbour Board helped the trust achieve its goal earlier than expected, and saw an average of £9,000 per day raised throughout the campaign. Fiona Reynolds, who is in her final week as director-general at the National Trust, said: 'Thanks to the generosity and support of thousands of people, we’ve reached our target nearly two months early. Precious landmark: A large chunk of the cliffs fell into the sea in March, highlighting how fragile they are in the face of coastal erosion . Iconic: The chalk cliffs have stood over dramatic moments in English history, including the return of British forces rescued from Dunkirk in the Second World War, here being re-enacted for the 60th anniversary in 2000 . 'This appeal has tapped into something . unique, the emotional connection that people have with special places . such as the White Cliffs of Dover. 'The . trust will now look to enhance the quality of access to this new land . and build on some of the fantastic nature conservation work that has . been carried out by the team on the ground.' The chalk cliffs stretching east from Dover are home to a rich array of wildlife such as the Adonis blue butterfly and peregrine falcons, Kent’s only kittiwake, and plants including oxtongue broomrape and sea carrots. They have stood over dramatic moments in English history, including the first arrival of the Romans and the return of British forces rescued from Dunkirk in the Second World War. And they have featured in songs and poetry, most famously the wartime classic (There’ll Be Bluebirds Over) The White Cliffs of Dover, sung by Dame Vera Lynn, and Matthew Arnold’s poem Dover Beach. Dames to the rescue: Judy Dench (left) and Vera Lynn (right) are among a host of celebrities who offereed their support to the campaign, which reached its target in just 133 days . Alison Burnett, a volunteer on the White . Cliffs of Dover team, said: 'This chalky stretch of coastline symbolises . so much for so many people and it’s wonderful to think that we’ve . managed to raise the money so that future generations can enjoy all that . this unique place has to offer.' Bob Goldfield, chief executive of the Port of Dover, said: 'It was very important to us that our donation would assist the trust in its ability to maintain and protect the cliffs, thereby ensuring a real and lasting legacy.' The trust manages the cliffs as chalk grassland, parts of which are grazed by Exmoor ponies to preserve the natural flora and support wildlife such as butterflies. Access is maintained for the public, who visit in their hundreds of thousands each year. Although people are already able to walk the cliffs from the visitor centre to the lighthouse, part of the stretch is privately owned and in places arable fields come to the edge of cliffs, leaving just a sliver of land for the coastal path. By buying the 0.8mile piece of the coastal jigsaw, the trust will be able to restore the natural habitat, providing more space for species to retreat as the cliffs naturally erode, and connect the trust’s existing areas of land. The trust, which acquired its first stretch of the White Cliffs in 1968, looks after more than 720 miles of coastline around England, Wales and Northern Ireland.","More than 16,000 people and organisations have backed fundraising appeal .

The teenage girl who called police for help to kill a spider in her house has been revealed to be wheelchair-bound and suffering from muscular dystrophy. Makenna Sewell, a student at Forest Grove High School in a suburb of Portland, Oregon, admits she felt silly calling the police department to kill a spider - but she insists it really was a danger to her and her brother. She said that the spider was a brown recluse - a species with venom so toxic that it can prove deadly. Her mother had recently been bitten by one and had to be hospitalized. Scroll down for video . Makenna Sewell said she felt silly calling police to kill the spider, but said she legitimately feared for her safety . Makenna, who has muscular dystrophy, said she was afraid that the spider - which she believed to be a deadly venomous brown recluse - would harm her or little brother . And she insists it was BIG. 'It was no quarter-size house spider. It was massive! It was massive,' she told KPTV. She told an emergency dispatcher on August 16 that the spider was the size of a baseball. Brown recluse spiders don't typically grown larger than three quarters of an inch in diameter. She also says that she didn't call 911 - instead she called the police non-emergency number for advice on what to do. 'Just seeing a spider that big and knowing what it did to my immune system and me having a compromised immune system and a younger brother, I just knew that it wasn't good and I had to call someone,' she said. She said she had called her parents, but couldn't reach either of them. When an officer arrived, she said, he was surprisingly gracious - and quickly swatted the arachnid with a rolled up newspaper. Dangerous: Brown recluse spiders, like the one pictured, are very venomous and can even kill bite victims - though they are seldom aggressive . Makenna said he insisted she keep the dead spider and send it in for testing - because he had never seen one that big, either. She said she feels grateful that she lives in the sort of town where a teenager can summon a police officer to kill a spider. The audio from her police call reveals a comical scene. 'I'm home alone and there is a giant spider on the back of my couch, and I'm talking giant. I've never seen a spider this big and I have no idea what to do,' she told the slightly perplexed operator. The teen estimated the spider was the size of a baseball and said it was appeared similar to a tarantula. She told the dispatcher that she generally wasn't fazed by spiders, but a family member was recently bitten by one and had to go to the hospital. She said she initially tried to get hold of her parents but failed. Spider: A Seattle teen recently called 911 to report an intruder in her home, pictured, but rather than a brazen thief, it turned out to be a 'massive freaking' spider . 'I don't know if you guys have anything I can do, or if I just sit here and stare at it and wait for someone to get home to kill it,' she asked in the genuine plea, according to KPTV. The 911 dispatcher contemplated how to handle the situation, and finally agreed to have an officer contact the panicked teen. 'Is that ridiculous?' she asked. When the officer arrived at the home, he reported the spider was about 2 inches in diameter and disposed of it with an old-fashioned rolled up newspaper, police said. Though it's not standard protocol for them to respond to a call about a spider, Forest Grove police said they decided to help the young lady out in this instance.","In the bizarre August 16 call, the frantic Oregon teen prefaces her predicament by saying 'I just kind of have a ridiculous question'

Viagra will lose its patent protection in Britain this month, meaning rivals could start selling imitations of the blue pill for as little as 85p. Generic copies of the erectile dysfunction drug could legally be manufactured for the first time since Pfizer launched Viagra in Britain in 1999. Rivals could produce copies under the drug’s chemical name, sildenafil, which could cut the price of a pill from £10 to 85p and save the NHS millions of pounds. In 2012 alone, the NHS spent £40.3million on the medicine, with doctors writing nearly two million prescriptions a year. Pfizer said it would launch its own cheaper brand, named Sildenafil Pfizer, to avoid being outdone by competitors. The company said men would still need a prescription to buy the blue, diamond-shaped pill on viagra.com but would not need to see a pharmacist to get it. Pfizer is trying to stop online pharmacies from selling imitation versions of their product up to 95 per cent cheaper and without customers requiring proof they’ve been prescribed it. A 2011 study, in which Pfizer bought ‘Viagra’ from 22 internet pharmacies and tested them, found that 77 per cent were counterfeit. But Jonathan Emms, the company’s UK managing director, said Viagra would continue to sell because most people asked for the medicine by name. Mr Emms told the Times: ‘The brand is very well established and well known among patients.’ But the British Generic Manufacturers Association said competition would be fierce, adding: ‘This is potentially a substantial market and we would expect many companies to launch generic versions when the patent expires.’ As many as 20 manufacturers are planning to unveil generic versions of the drug when the US group’s patent expires on June 21. In 2012 alone the NHS spent £40.3million on Viagra . US drug company Pfizer's patent will expire in the UK this month and rival versions are expected to flood the market . Under NHS guidelines, men who are prescribed the medicine are usually limited to one tablet a week because of its cost. A fifth of all prescriptions are now private because of those restrictions. The drug’s popularity has meant that black market sales have thrived. But Wallace Dinsmore, a specialist in sexual health at the Royal Victoria Hospital, said a cheaper version of the drug might stop illicit internet sales. He said: ‘It should completely torpedo the black market. If you can buy it for a pound or two a pill, why would you go to some dodgy internet site?’ Pfizer, which is based in New York,  reported revenue of $2.05billion from Viagra in 2012 and $1.98billion in 2011.","Patent protection on 'little blue pill' will expire in Britain this month .

Nick Clegg has signalled that he may send his eldest son to a private school, potentially sparking controversy about his commitment to state education. The Deputy Prime Minister said he would put his children’s education first and would not overrule the wishes of his wife or son for ‘political reasons’. Mr Clegg and his Spanish wife, Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, have looked around several schools, including the exclusive Catholic state school The London Oratory and a £30,000-a-year independent school. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he would not overrule wife Miriam or son Antonio if they chose a private school . The Lib Dem leader’s admission comes . just days after David Cameron insisted he was ‘committed’ to sending his . eldest daughter Nancy to a state school as in London ‘there’s a real . improvement taking place’. But Mr Clegg refused to make the same pledge . when quizzed about his 11-year-old son Antonio, who is due to start . secondary school in September. The Cleggs have two other sons Alberto, seven, and Miguel, three. Speaking during his regular phone-in . show on LBC Radio, Mr Clegg said of their eldest son: ‘If we can and it . works out to send him to a good state school we would do so. ‘But like all parents living in . London, there’s huge competition for places and we don’t yet know where . and exactly at what school. ‘I never have sought to impose a decision on my wife as well as my son for political reasons. ‘They are educated at the moment in . the state sector, both our oldest, and I will let you know as soon as a . decision has been arrived at.’ Sources close to Mr Clegg said he . recognises that the couple’s decision is ‘a matter of public interest’ and they expect to make an announcement in the next couple of months. Mr Clegg is widely believed to defer . in matters of child-rearing to his  formidable wife, who ensured that . they were raised as Catholics, despite Mr Clegg’s atheist convictions. He has previously condemned the gulf . in educational standards between private and state schools as ‘corrosive . for our society and  damaging to our economy’. Mr Clegg used his weekly radio phone-in to insist he would not turn his children's education into a political football . Mr Clegg was educated at two . independent . schools, Caldicott School in Farnham Royal in South Buckinghamshire - a . £5,060-a-term prep-school where he was joint Head Prefect in 1980 - and . later at Westminster School . in London, which costs over £21,000-a-year for day pupils. His son Alberto is at primary school . and Miguel is due to start school next year. Miguel and Antonio attend a . Catholic primary school. The comments follow David Cameron’s  remarks last week that he remained ‘committed’ to sending his eldest daughter Nancy to a state secondary school. Mr Cameron said: ‘In London there’s a real improvement taking place. There’s a revolution taking place in all schools actually. ‘There’s a big culture change in our schools and that’s taking place in London. So I remain committed to what I’ve said in the past.’ But Mr Clegg has yet to make a decision, insisting ‘I am a father before I’m a politician’. ‘I want my child to have the best possible education, I would ever, ever begrudge any parent whether they send their children to a private or a state school, to do the best for their children, it’s the most fundamental instinct anyone has. ‘And by the way I have that raging through my veins as much as any father who wants the best for my child. ‘I’ve said it before it’s not about whether it’s private or public, in that sense you’re quite right it can be either, I just want the best for my child and that’s exactly what I think most people listening to this programme want for their children as well.’","Deputy PM refuses to make children's education a 'political football'

Best of friends: A hug for Eileen from Ron in 1926 . Born on the same hospital ward just months apart, they became firm friends as children  in Gillingham, Kent, thanks to their fathers, who had served together in the Navy during  the First World War. ‘Our parents decided to dress us as a bride and groom for the Gillingham Carnival,’ said Mrs Everest. ‘We were only four years old but I still remember that day so well. ‘Our mothers were both good with a needle so they made the costumes and we walked all round Gillingham in them.’ But the pair’s friendship almost came to an end soon afterwards when Eileen’s family moved to Greenwich, South-East London. A decade later, they moved back to Welling in Kent, but by that time, Ron’s family had settled in Gravesend after a stint in Scotland. They were not reunited until they were 18 – when Eileen was won over by Ron’s naval uniform. She said: ‘I started work and there was a telephone and I really wanted to ring someone. 'I asked my mother if she knew anyone who had a phone and she said she remembered an old friend who had one.

She said it would be nice to meet up with me and my mother and she brought Ron along too. ‘I did not think much of Ron at all. But I did think he looked handsome in his Navy uniform. To be honest I liked the look of the uniform more than him.’ After that meeting, the pair began writing to each other regularly, rekindling their childhood friendship – and beginning a romance. Ron proposed by letter in 1940, but the wedding was put on hold  as he went off to war, seeing action in the Far East and Arctic convoys. In 1943, they finally married for real in Welling – looking much more at ease in their formal attire than they had aged four. Ron went back to war and was involved in the D-Day landings in June 1944, rising through the ranks to Chief Petty Officer before leaving the Navy in 1961. He then worked as an engineer before retiring. The couple moved to Dereham in Norfolk in 1986 to be near their only daughter, Carol, now 68, and their grandson Maxwell, 38. Mrs Everest said: ‘We have had our ups and downs, but we have always got on. I think we will stay together for ever.’ Mr Everest added: ‘We promised to love, honour and obey – and I did all the obeying.’ Mr and Mrs Everest (nee Campbell) were family friends united by their fathers.

An ‘independent’ celebrity-backed campaign to increase foreign aid was secretly engineered by Whitehall, it was claimed yesterday. The IF movement recruited David Beckham, Orlando Bloom and Mo Farah to ensure the Government made good on a pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas help. But internal documents reveal plans were cooked up by ministers and advisers at Whitehall and the Tory party conference two years ago. Both Mo Farah and David Beckham supported the IF campaign which held a rally earlier this month . At one of the first summits, an aide . of David Cameron met representatives of five charities which between . them receive more than £60million a year from the taxpayer via the . Department for International Development. Andrew Mitchell, the International . Development Secretary at the time, then held a series of other meetings . to orchestrate the rest of the campaign. Details were obtained through a Freedom of Information request by War on Want. Charity chief John Hilary said the Government wanted to use IF to ‘promote the Prime Minister as a leader on the global stage’. Earlier this month, Mr Cameron was pictured with comedian David Walliams (left) and 100 children backing the campaign. Last month David Beckham and actor Orlando Bloom publicised an IF rally in London's Hyde Park . War on Want claimed it did not join . the campaign after being told it could only do so if it refused to . criticise government policy. ‘The effects of their politics both . here and overseas are very regressive, so the idea that we would have to . be silent on that, and that the campaign could not target those . policies, was deeply disturbing,’ added Mr Hilary. The charities that comprise the IF . campaign – Oxfam, Save the Children, ActionAid, Catholic aid agency . Cafod, and Christian Aid – insist they would never compromise their . independence. The government has been accused of using the IF campaign to promote the Prime Minister as a leader on the global stage . IF said there was no ‘conspiracy’, . while a spokesman for DfID added: ‘We award funding based solely on . ability to deliver specific and measurable results.’ However, the revelations have caused . Tory backbenchers to renew their efforts to scrap the 0.7 per cent . target – which comes at a time when other Whitehall department budgets . are being cut. Douglas Carswell, MP for Clacton, . said: ‘This is more evidence that big corporate aid organisations . collude with big government to spend our money. They don’t always spend . it in the interests of the poorest people in the world that they claim . to be representing.’ The internal memos reveal how the . foreign aid charities first wrote to Mr Cameron detailing their plans . for the IF campaign in February 2011. By September that year, it was agreed . to use the London Olympics to push the aid agenda – and a ‘hunger . summit’ at Downing Street last August allowed Mr Cameron to be pictured . with athlete Mo Farah two days after his second gold medal win. IF was launched at the start of the year. The name was chosen as a label and the initials do not stand for anything. Earlier this month, Mr Cameron was pictured with comedian David Walliams and 100 children backing the campaign. Last month David Beckham and actor Orlando Bloom helped publicise an IF rally attended by 45,000 people in London’s Hyde Park.","The government has been accused of using the IF campaign to promote the Prime Minister as a leader on the global stage .

Ailsa Malcolm-Hutton, 30, has been told she has between two and five years to live, after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease earlier this month. The progressive, incurable disease attacks the nerves in the brain and spinal cord. Ailsa Malcolm-Hutton, 30, was diagnosed with MND earlier this month. She has drawn up a 'bucket list' of things she wants to do with her daughter, Isabella, six, before she dies . MND is a terminal illness that  kills the motor neurones - the nerve cells that send messages to the muscles so the body can move. There are 5,000 people living with motor neurone disease in the UK at any one time, but it’s unusual for it to strike in under-40s; most people diagnosed are between 50 and 70. The patient eventually becomes entirely paralysed - unable to move, talk, swallow or breathe, but still able to see, hear and feel. In most cases there is no obvious cause - around ten per cent of cases are genetic. Life expectancy is usually six months to five years and the only licensed treatment is the drug riluzole, which can slow the progression of the disease, but only for up to six months. More than £300 million is spent annually on cancer research in the UK, the average annual spending on MND research is £2 million. It slowly affects the ability of the sufferer to walk, talk, eat, drink and breathe. The former barmaid lives with her six-year-old daughter, Isabella, and her mother, Annette, in Manchester, and said she is determined to make every day count. Her ‘bucket list’ includes a trip to Disney World in Florida with her daughter, playing a hand of poker in Las Vegas, and taking a helicopter trip across the Grand Canyon. Ms Malcolm-Hutton said: ‘I’m being strong, I haven’t really broken down yet mainly because people are doing such wonderful things for me - it’s keeping me going. ‘I’m still in my party years - it’s really rare for a 30-year-old woman to have this disease - but I’m determined that I’m not going to stop going out or become a recluse. ‘Isabella is only six, and can’t grasp the severity of it. When I told her I might need a wheelchair, she was very upset at first but then said she’d get me a red wheelchair, because I love Manchester United. ‘If I’m strong for her now, hopefully . she’ll remember me as a strong person. I want to be an inspiration to . her, and for us to do fun things together - that’s why I’ve made the . bucket list.’ Ms Malcolm-Hutton (pictured with her daughter, Isabella, and her mother, Annette) was diagnosed after she noticed that she was struggling to grip objects as she picked them up . Ms Malcolm-Hutton's 'bucket list' includes taking her daughter to Disney World, going on a girly holiday to Croatia, appearing on television, and playing poker in Las Vegas . (Not all to be done with Isabella!) A trip to Disney World, Florida . To visit Miami, Jamaica, Canada and the Scottish Highlands . To be the only woman on a lads holiday to Ibiza . To go on a girly trip to Croatia . To play poker in Las Vegas . To take a helicopter ride around the Grand Canyon . To appear on TV . To marry Robin Van Persie (but I’d settle for a kiss!) Ms Malcolm-Hutton first noticed symptoms . of the condition in May 2012 – she found that she was struggling to . grip glasses and lift objects. She went to her GP, who immediately referred her to neurological specialists at Salford Royal Hospital. She said: ‘The night before I was really nervous - I’d done some research and thought it might be MND, so I was fretting about that. Otherwise, I thought it would probably be only something little. ‘When they told me it was motor neurone disease, my face just dropped. I read about the disease and the life expectancy. ‘I can’t remember anything about the day after that, apart from pleading with the doctor to check if really it was MND.’ To donate money to help Ms Malcolm-Hutton achieve the aims on her ‘bucket list’, visit www.justgiving.com/local/project/timeisprecious .","Ailsa Malcolm-Hutton, 30, was diagnosed with MND earlier this month .

But, she quickly added, ""Somebody had to stand up to him."" Jacqueline Goldberg's comment came during her second and final day on the stand at a civil trial examining her claim that Trump perpetrated a bait-and-switch as she bought properties at the glitzy Trump International Hotel & Tower in downtown Chicago.The case pits the grandmotherly Goldberg against a New Yorker who revels in his image as a big talker with big ideas. Trump fosters his no-nonsense persona in the catch phrase he uses to boot contestants off his ""Apprentice"" TV show – ""You're fired!"" Bait and switch: Jacqueline Goldberg, 87, leaves the federal building in Chicago after testifying in a lawsuit alleging that Donald Trump cheated her in a bait-and-switch scheme . A defiant, often agitated Trump testified for two days last week and took verbal swipes at Goldberg in comments to reporters outside the courtroom in Chicago. He asserted that he, not Goldberg, is the victim, saying, ""She's trying to rip me off.""On the stand Monday, Goldberg said Trump wooed her into buying two condos for about $1 million apiece in the mid-2000s by dangling a promise to share profits in the 92-story building – only to snatch that offer away after she committed to buy.

""I felt like I have been conned,"" she told jurors. When she learned in 2008 that the profit-sharing was no longer part of the overall deal she thought she had bought into, Goldberg said she was dismayed.

But it was the profit-sharing proposal that, for her, sealed the deal, she said.In his testimony, though, Trump balked at the idea Goldberg didn't know what she had gotten into. He told jurors a provision in a purchasing contract she signed gave Trump the right to cancel the profit-sharing offer and that she bought the condos anyway.""And then she sued me,"" he boomed, raising his arms.

The world’s largest ice sheet could be more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than previously thought, according to new research. British scientists used 50 years of declassified spy satellite imagery from 1963 to 2012 to create the first long-term record of changes of where glaciers meet the sea along 3,355 miles of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet’s coastline. The East Antarctic Ice Sheet holds the vast majority of the world’s ice - enough to raise global sea levels by more than 50 metres - and the researchers warned the ice could be affected by rising global temperatures. The world's largest ice sheet could be more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than previously thought, according to new research by Durham University . Using measurements from 175 glaciers, the researchers from the Geography Department of Durham University were able to show that the glaciers underwent rapid and synchronised periods of advance and retreat which coincided with cooling and warming. The team said this suggested that large parts of the ice sheet, which reaches thicknesses of more than two-and-a-half miles could be more susceptible to changes in air temperatures and sea-ice than was originally believed. Current scientific opinion suggests that glaciers in East Antarctica are at less risk from climate change than areas such as Greenland or West Antarctica due to its extremely cold temperatures, which can fall below minus 30C at the coast and much colder further inland. British scientists used 50 years of declassified spy satellite imagery (pictured) from 1963 to 2012 to create the first long-term record of changes of where glaciers meet the sea along 3,355 miles of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet's coastline . But in a study published in Nature journal, the Durham team said there was now an urgent need to understand the vulnerability of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. Dr Chris Stokes, of the university's geography department, said: 'We know that these large glaciers undergo cycles of advance and retreat that are triggered by large icebergs breaking off at the terminus, but this can happen independently from climate change. 'It was a big surprise therefore to see rapid and synchronous changes in advance and retreat, but it made perfect sense when we looked at the climate and sea-ice data.' He explained that when temperatures rose the sea-ice decreased and most glaciers retreated, while in cooler temperatures the sea-ice increased and the glaciers advanced. A satellite image from 2000 shows several major East Antarctic outlet glaciers flowing through the Southern Cross Mountains, Victoria Land, and out across the Ross Sea. These glaciers are located in the coldest part of the study region and did not exhibit any clear trends in advance or retreat, unlike those along the much warmer western Pacific coast . 'In many ways, these measurements of terminus change are like canaries in a mine - they don’t give us all the information we would like, but they are worth taking notice of,' said Dr Stokes. The researchers found that despite large fluctuations in terminus positions between glaciers - linked to their size - three significant patterns emerged. They discovered in the 1970s and ‘80s, temperatures were rising and most glaciers retreated but during the 1990s, temperatures decreased and most glaciers advanced. The 2000s saw temperatures increase and then decrease, leading to a more even mix of retreat and advance, according to the research. Here, Valley glacier in the Transantarctic Mountains enters the Ross Ice Shelf. Using measurements from 175 glaciers, the researchers were able to show that the glaciers underwent rapid and synchronised periods of advance and retreat which coincided with cooling and warming . Trends in temperature and glacier change were statistically significant along the East Antarctic Ice Sheet’s warmer Pacific Coast, but no significant changes were found along the much cooler Ross Sea Coast, which might be expected if climate is driving the changes, the Durham researchers said. Dr Stokes said: 'If the climate is going to warm in the future, our study shows that large parts of the margins of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet are vulnerable to the kinds of changes that are worrying us in Greenland and West Antarctica - acceleration, thinning and retreat. 'When temperatures warm in the air or ocean, glaciers respond by retreating and this can have knock-on effects further inland, where more and more ice is drawn-down towards the coast. 'We need to monitor their behaviour more closely and maybe reassess our rather conservative predictions of future ice sheet dynamics in East Antarctica.'

'What You Need' section of Jamie Oliver's new book come from the celebrity chef's own . range of Tefal utensils . Jamie Oliver's mission to get Britain to eat well on a budget got off to a controversial start last week when he lambasted working-class families for buying gigantic flatscreen TVs while eating junk food. But his new austerity cookbook, which promises ‘exciting food that’s not hard on your wallet’, might not quite provide the low-cost answers hard-pressed households need. Home cooks wanting to try all the ‘money-saving’ meals in Save With Jamie would need to spend more than £500 on kitchen utensils and food ‘staples’ before buying a single main ingredient. In the book – which itself costs a wallet-straining £26 – Oliver lists 47 items of equipment needed for the recipes, including a griddle pan, a pestle and mortar and three different kinds of grater, which would cost at least £360. In addition, Oliver cites a list of ‘stock cupboard essentials’, including groundnut oil, sesame oil, quinoa, organic yogurt, polenta and kaffir lime leaves. When totalled up, the hefty shopping list of 107 foods, spices and oils would cost almost £150. The Mail on Sunday has calculated the figures for ingredients and equipment using the cheapest alternatives available. But most of the items pictured in the ‘What You Need’ section of the book come  from the TV chef’s own range of Tefal utensils, which come at a  hefty premium. While a basic food processor – which is required in almost 20 of  the book’s recipes – costs from £60, Oliver’s branded version costs £150. Other items on his list include a set of three saucepans that retail at  £130, a single griddle pan at £67, three non-stick frying pans for  £95, and graters which cost up to  £20 each. Oliver, who has long been an outspoken food campaigner, was widely condemned last week for his comments about the eating habits of working-class families, when he recalled a scene from one of his previous TV shows which, he said, showed ‘the mum and the kid eating chips and cheese out of Styrofoam containers, and behind them is a massive TV.’ ‘It just didn’t weigh up.’  he added. The interview was to promote his new Channel 4 show, Jamie’s Money Saving Meals, which starts tomorrow and is tied in with the supposedly budget cookbook. ‘Naked Chef’ Oliver, who is worth an estimated £150 million, says he is determined to demonstrate  that fresh cooking could be more economical than pre-made convenience food. He added: ‘The fascinating thing for me is that seven times out of ten, the poorest families in this country choose the most expensive way to hydrate and feed their families: the ready meals, the convenience foods . ‘I meet people who say, “You don’t understand what it’s like.” I just want to hug them and teleport them to the Sicilian street cleaner who has 25 mussels, ten cherry tomatoes, and a packet of spaghetti for 60p, and knocks out the most amazing pasta. You go to Italy or Spain and they eat well on not much money. ‘We’ve missed out on that in Britain, somehow.’ Shopping list: Some of the 'essential' items from Oliver's own kitchen range that are touted in the cook book . His comments were challenged by the Child Poverty Action Group, whose head of policy, Imran Hussain, said: ‘For many families it’s low income which gets in the way of healthy eating. 'As official statistics show, parents of poor children are much less likely to be able to afford fresh fruit for their children.’ Last night, a spokesman for the chef hit back at the accusations that the Save With Jamie cookbook is out of touch with the average household’s budget. He said: ‘Jamie always puts a list of kitchen kit and store cupboard ingredients in his books as a guide for people and, in fact, we get a lot of positive feedback from readers about those pages. ‘Of course, as it’s merely a guide, no one would be expected to buy everything at the same time and, in most cases, readers would find that they probably have a fair few of the items on the lists anyway. ‘And of course you don’t have to buy everything before attempting a recipe or three – you would only have to buy a tiny proportion of the entire list to make some delicious, affordable food which costs, on average, around £1.32 per portion.’","Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver's austerity cookbook costs an extravagant £26 .

She later moved to manage an Exeter holiday park, making millions following a management buy-out and subsequent sale. Since then she has invested in multiple successful businesses, including handing over more than £2 million of her own cash on Dragon’s Den.","Deborah Meaden signs up to appear on this year's Strictly Come Dancing .

Windsurfers took advantage of the fantastic conditions at the Watersports Festival on Hayling Island in Hampshire. And there were plenty of punters on the River Cam in Cambridge basking in canal boats. Today's hot weather comes after it was revealed Britain has sizzled in the warmest, driest and sunniest summer since 2006. After a few washout summers, this year saw a settled June followed by a July heatwave and a sunny August. The Met Office has revealed that between June 1 and August 28, the average temperature in the UK was 15.2C (59F) – just under the 15.78C (60F) figure recorded in 2006. A total of 189mm of rainfall was measured, 78 per cent of the UK average and half last summer’s total of 379mm. In 2006, 188.3mm of rain was recorded, along with 601.5 hours of clear sunshine that was not blocked by any cloud. That compares to 588 hours this summer, making it the seventh sunniest summertime since 1929.

English summer: Visitors to Harlow Carr in North Yorkshire could enjoy glorious flowers in full late summer bloom . But in a statement released yesterday, the Met Office said: ‘While this summer is warmer, drier and sunnier than the long-term average, it hasn’t been exceptional. ‘It stands out because the last six summers have been wetter than average, with 2012 and 2007 both being in the top five wettest, and 2008 and 2009 also in the top ten wettest in records from 1910.’ And while the 19-day July heatwave stood out as the most striking weather event of the season, the report said it was ‘more notable for its duration than the actual temperatures recorded’. The sun rises behind Olivers Ducket, a folly overlooking the Vale of York, North Yorkshire this morning on the final day of meteological summer, which has been the warmest, driest and sunniest summer since 2006 .

Dramatic: But they said that, far from being blisteringly hot, we have had the kind of summer we should have . The summer’s highest temperature was not during the heatwave but on August 1, when the mercury reached 34.1C (93F) at Heathrow – the highest in the UK since July 2006. Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge said: ‘We’ve had the kind of summer we should have had, rather than the wet and cooler summers we have suffered in recent years. ‘There will be plenty of fine, dry weather for the south and South East next week - certainly warmer than normal for this time of the year. It could reach around 25C (77F)early in the week and perhaps a little warmer later next week. 'But it will only be a brief sunny interlude, with conditions becoming more unsettled and temperatures back to normal by the end of the week.’ Improvement: After five wetter than average summers, 2013 has proved to be a scorcher . Afternoon delight: Tourists have been out enjoying a boat trip on the River Cam in glorious sunshine . Basking: July's 19-day heatwave was a highlight although the highest temperature was on August 1 . Blissful: The River Cam looked glorious again today with plenty of people taking advantage of the sunshine . Lazy river: The weather could not have been better for a punting trip . The unseasonal temperatures will be caused by an area of high pressure dominating England and Wales which will draw in warmer air from the continent. MeteoGroup forecaster Alexi Boothman predicted temperatures of 27C (80.6F) in the South East on Wednesday, with the possibility it could go higher the following day. She added: ‘The average temperature for the start of autumn in the South is 20C-21C (68F-69.8F) so it will be a good few degrees higher than average. But in the north temperatures could be up to ten degrees lower, much closer to the seasonal average in that part of the country.’ The Met Office said this summer was likely to finish around eighth to tenth warmest since 1910.

A drag artist who dazzled audiences when he took to the stage as his alter ego Betty Swollocks has been ordered to pay back thousands of pounds in benefits. Brighton man John Townend cheated nearly £7,000 from the taxpayer during a four-year period after convincing the authorities he had no income. But on Friday and Saturday nights, the 62-year-old could be found strutting his stuff on the stage of the Poison Ivy bar in the city centre. Scroll down for video . Alter ego: John Townend claimed he had no income while working as a drag artist under his stage name of Betty Swollocks . He appeared at Brighton Magistrates’ Court yesterday charged with four counts of dishonestly making a statement he knew to be false for the purpose of obtaining housing and council tax benefit. The charges related to offences between November 2007 to September 2011. In total he claimed £5,870.76 in housing benefit plus £980.83 in council tax benefit. He pleaded guilty to all the charges. Townend - who was summoned to court under his real name and his stage name Betty Swollocks - was earning £25 a night plus free drinks at the Poison Ivy in Brighton. He also worked at the Queen's Arms in the city. Len Batten prosecuting told the court that Brighton and Hove City Council received a referral in October 2011 as it was suspected that Townend had not declared his income as a ‘cabaret artist called Betty Swollocks’. Suited: Townend (left) ditched his dress for a more sombre looking pinstripe suite when he appeared at court. Right, Townend as Betty Swollocks . Drag act: Townend would light up the stage when he appeared as his alter ego Betty Swollocks. Right, he was a regular at the Poison Ivy . Mr Batten said: ‘He said he had no income and was waiting for a redundancy payment. He said he was paid cash-in-hand from May to July 2011.' He added his client had been expecting a redundancy payment of about £1,200. Mr . Batten argued the council wrote to the Queen's Arms in George Street, . Brighton, which provided invoices from April 2007 to September 2011. All of them were signed by either John Townend or Betty Swollocks. Townend had a website devoted to his alter ego Betty Swollocks, which has since been removed. Mr Batten said Townend was interviewed under caution July last year and showed ‘a good understanding of the benefits system’. He originally said that he had declared his work at the Queen's Arm's, but later retracted his statement, claiming he was confused as to whether he was employed or self-employed. Details obtained from the Poison Ivy in Brighton showed Townend was paid £25 cash-in-hand on a self-employed basis for performing his act on Friday and Saturday nights. Free drinks were also included in the deal. Defending, Jenna Threadgold claimed Townend ‘wasn’t aware’ he was committing an offence. Miss Threadgold said: ‘What he says is that he did have some work, it was sporadic and was only paid £25. ‘He is not someone who is earning a substantial amount of money. He has health problems and didn’t work for eight months. ‘During this time he was homeless and living in hostels. He has been on a very limited income. Busted: An investigation revealed Townend could be seen regularly strutting his stuff on the dressed as his alter ego Betty Swallocks . ‘He was telling someone but he told the wrong organisation. When he went to sign on with the Department of Work and Pensions he did told them when he did a bit of work. ‘He should have been telling the council as well, he thought it was one organisation.’ Miss Threadgold told the court Townend had ‘mobility problems’ and had mobility aids in his home due to having screws in his hips. She said he has now employed an accountant to help him keep up with his self employment and is ‘remorseful and embarrassed’ about the situation. The case comes just over a week after another transvestite was jailed after claiming he was disabled and pocketing £88,000 in benefits while performing as the star of a drag act called Glitterlips. Mark Hawthorne, 49, said he could barely walk and needed around the clock care to help him get out of bed in order to receive disability handouts for almost a decade. Just over a week ago: Drag queen Mark Hawthorn, left, 49, arriving at Stafford Crown Court to be sentenced for claiming disability benefits while performing as Tilly in drag act Glitterlips, right . By night, however, he adopted the stage name Aunt Tilly and would strut his stuff in nightclubs to Tina Turner and Diana Ross songs as part of a double act. He was caught out when fraud investigators discovered a video of him in action in a blonde wig, high heels and a cocktail party dress, which had been uploaded on YouTube and Facebook. Hawthorne was jailed for six months at Stafford Crown Court after admitting three counts of failing to notify the Department of Work and Pensions of a change of circumstances and two counts of fraud. Townend, who appeared in court wearing a smart pinstripe suit, has started to pay back the £6,856 he owes at £40 per month for the council tax benefit, and £15 per month for the housing benefit. He is currently receiving a pension and benefits. He was handed a community order by magistrates to undertake 120 hours of unpaid work over 12 months. He was also asked to pay £500 prosecution costs. The investigation was said to have cost £1,606.

The age-old saying 'waste not want not' has been heard around dinner tables for generations. And one man is hoping to prove just how waste can be put to good use, after coming up with a recipe for badger casserole in response to the government's plans to cull the animals. Arthur Boyt, from Davidstow, Cornwall, has been eating roadkill for over 50 years, and sees no reason why culled badgers should be taken off the menu. Arthur Boyt has been eating discarded roadkill since he was 13. One of his favourite snacks is a badger sandwich . He said: 'I'm against the cull - but it would be ridiculous not to use the dead badgers. Badger makes a pretty good meal.' 'I don't agree with the killing of badgers, unless scientists can prove without a shadow of a doubt that they cause harm to cattle. 'But I was left wondering, what are they going to do with the tonnes of fully edible badger meat from perfectly healthy animals they have shot? 'I've eaten badger for 55 years and I certainly haven't got tuberculosis. As with all meat you just make sure you cook it long and hot enough to kill any bugs. 'Badgers are fully edible, and their meat could be used to feed the hungry rather than being chucked in a furnace, I can't see any point in that.' Mr Boyt from Davidstow, Cornwall, doesn't agree with the shooting of badgers but sees no point in their meat going to waste . Though Mr Boyt sees no issue in eating dead animals, he does not kill them himself but rather picks them up from the side of the road after they have been run over on roads around his home in Bodmin Moor, Cornwall. His long-suffering wide, Sue Boyt, 59, does not share his taste in meat however as she is a vegetarian. Mr Boyt collects the animals with a shovel, skins them and cuts the meat into joints, often making them into a stew or sandwich. His diet regularly includes fox, hare, sparrow, deer, pigeon and even a porcupine he brought back from a holiday in Canada. The unusual way of dining isn't fattening either, as despite eating three meals a day Mr Boyt weighs just over nine stone. He said: 'People are happy to eat an apple which has fallen out of the tree - so what's the difference? Just because it hasn't got a label on doesn't mean it's not edible.' Mr Boyt's eating habits began when he was 13, after he discovered a dead pheasant in a park. 'I took it home and asked mum to cook it and it was delicious.' Stop the cull: Protestors in the Somerset village of Monksilver patrol fields in a bid to prevent culling . Since 1992 it has been illegal to kill badgers in Britain, but there is no law which deems it illegal to eat them once they are already dead. The badger cull has divided opinion in Somerset where shooting began on Monday. It is expected that 5,000 of the species will be killed in the cull. Plans for a second shoot in Gloucestershire have been put on hold. Protestors have been monitoring setts and patrolling their communities at nightfall to prevent the cull which is intended to stop badgers infecting cattle with tuberculosis. Liz Gaffer, a spokeswoman for Gloucestershire Against Badger Shooting said: 'These are not animal rights extremists, they are just normal people who are concerned about how humane this cull is.' Ingredients . Two badger hams, potatoes, broccoli, a big onion, sliced carrot, cooking oil, parsnip, flour, salt, pepper, spices, tomatoes . Mr Boyt's recipe involves skinning a badger and cooking its body parts with tomatoes, carrots and wine among other things . 'Skin the badger in the garage as this stops the fleas getting all round the house. 'Take off the hind legs with as much back muscle as possible and this will give you two good hams weighing around 3lbs. 'The hams will have a good covering of fat and this will serve to baste the meat during cooking. If you are having a big crowd to dinner, add the forelegs, shoulder and, if need be, the neck as well. 'Dredge the hams in seasoned flour, put a little oil into a casserole dish and lightly fry the meat on both sides. Remove the meat and fry the onion until it is golden. 'Slice the spuds and parsnip, put them on the onion and chuck in the tomatoes. 'Put the meat on top and pour on a cup of cider/wine/stock with the remains of the seasoned flour. Bring to the boil, cover and simmer for five minutes. 'Place in a hot oven for an hour to an hour and a half. Alternatively you can put it in a slow oven or in the bottom of the AGA for 3hrs and go out for a good walk to work up an appetite. 'Add the chopped up carrots and put it back in the oven for half an hour. 'Boil a pan of broccoli (or greens of your choice) for five minutes.' Spoon off any fat or oil from the casserole and serve the meat on the bone with the sauce.","Arthur Boyt, 73, has been eating roadkill for over 50 years .

Winner: Gold medal winner Laura Trott says car drivers aren't always to blame for cyclists being knocked down . In the notoriously vicious car versus cycle debate, you might expect Olympic gold medal winner Laura Trott to be firmly on the side of her fellow pedallers. But the London 2012 star has actually hit out at rogue members of her cycling tribe, saying that they jump lights and weave dangerously through traffic. The double gold medal winner also said that accidents were ‘not always the car’s fault’ and insisted that laws should be brought in to make safety helmets compulsory. She told how her sister, also a professional cyclist, had been knocked off her bike but survived because she was wearing a helmet. Miss Trott, 21, from Essex, said: ‘Cyclists wonder why they get a bad name. I see cyclists jumping in and out of the buses and people wonder why they get hit. ‘It’s not always the car’s fault. Cyclists need to help themselves and should not jump red lights. I would ride in London but I certainly wouldn’t ride like that, you just have to be careful. ‘I can understand going down the outside of traffic but you should obey the rules of the road because we’re all road users.’ Cyclist deaths are at a five-year high nationwide, with 122 people killed last year and more than 3,200 seriously injured in road accidents. The cyclist- who won gold in the Omnium and team pursuit events in the velodrome at the Olympics - said that helmets should be compulsory for cyclists. Warning: Miss Trott says it should be compulsory for cyclists to wear helmets . Life-saver: Laura Trott revealed said a helmet stopped her sister from suffering serious injuries when she was hit by a car in Belgium . She said that the lesson had been drummed into her from a young age by her parents and her sister’s experiences had only proved these lessons right. In 2010, her sister Emma, 23, broke her collarbone and suffered a concussion that was so bad she ‘barely knew who she was’ when a car hit five British cyclists in Belgium. Miss Trott, the chief cycling ambassador for the London Mayor Boris Johnson, believes that her sister’s life was saved by the helmet she wore. She said: ‘When I was 11 I didn’t want to look uncool but my parents wouldn’t let me out unless I was wearing it. ‘I think it should be a legal . requirement to wear a helmet. So many lives have been saved by them and . it saved my sister’s life. She got hit by a car and cut her head open. ‘When . Emma called from hospital she barely even knew who she was, so if she . wasn’t wearing a helmet now, she wouldn’t be here today. ‘For me, putting my helmet on now is a habit and I’ll wear it even if I’m going to the shop for a pint of milk.’ Debate: Cyclists weaving in and out of traffic and jumping red lights are a danger, Miss Trott said . Help themselves: Cyclists need to obey the rules of the road to be safe, the Olympic gold medal winner added . She joins Sir Bradley Wiggins, the four-time Olympic gold medallist and first Briton to win the Tour de France, in calling for helmets to be made compulsory. He previously said: ‘I think certain laws for cyclists need to be passed to protect us more than anything. ‘Making helmets compulsory on the roads, making it illegal to maybe have an iPod in while you’re riding a bike, just little things like that would make a huge difference.’ Miss Trott also hailed a new £913million cycling fund to create a cycle superhighway and bike-friendly paths on accident blackspots in London. She said: ‘It shows we’re becoming a cycling nation and the scheme is needed now. If you don’t do it then London’s roads are going to be filled with cyclists. We need more bike lanes in central London.’","London 2012 star says accidents 'aren't always the cars fault'

A German couple on a dream holiday to Ecuador returned to find they had been the victim of destructive burglars - 'Nazi' raccoons! The raccoons - so-named because their forbears were released into the wild by Hitler deputy and chief hunting master of the Third Reich Hermann Goering in the 1930s - caused over £20,000 worth of damage. Gerhard and Erika George of Goeppingen were told by experts that the raccoons broke in hunting for food. Gotcha! The raccoon vandal is caught red handed rummaging for food at the German property . Clean-up: The raccoons' carnage was discovered by neighbour Tina Goetz, who found two in the shower . A neighbour who entered the kitchen on a daily basis to feed the couple's cats was astonished at the amount of food they were going through. 'Then I saw them in the bathroom!' said Tina Goetz.  'They must have got in through the cat flap.  The mess was indescribable. I came in and saw two of them sitting on a towel in the shower cabinet.' Firemen and police cleared the house of the invaders, who put up a fight and attempted to bite the team. They were taken four miles away to a wood and released. Nazi raccoons have been on the march across Europe for over the last decade. About one million Nazi-bred raccoons are over-running Germany, while their numbers are also set to grow in the UK. The furry animals are killing partridges and pheasants in the countryside and invading gardens, overturning trash bins and stealing pet food in the urban areas. Firemen and police cleared the house of the raccoons, which put up a fight and attempted to bite the team . Emergency services were called and managed to capture the animals using nets and a cage . The animals were taken four miles away to a wood and released. The raccoons have spread through Germany since their introduction in 1934 . Native of North America, a pair of raccoons were introduced to Germany's forests in 1934 by Goering to enrich the local fauna. But owing to the racoons' fast breeding, Germany's woodlands were soon overrun with the little black masked creatures. Hunters are trying to stem the striped-tide, but despite a record of 67,700 killings in 2011, the army of raccoons are still on the march, due to their reproducing speed and the absence of natural predators. From Germany, the raccoons have spread to France, Eastern Europe and Russia. In the UK raccoons have been spotted in Surrey, west Berkshire and Portsmouth. Following a 2007 change to the law in Britain they can now be kept as pets without a licence.","Pair of raccoons are thought to have got in through a cat flap .

The Chancellor has come under growing pressure from MPs and peers to split up Royal Bank of Scotland. In an open letter Andrew Tyrie, chair of the influential banking commission, said ‘all the options’ for the state backed lender’s future should be ‘examined as a matter of urgency’. The Conservative MP also dismissed one of the main reasons given by opponents to the split. Chancellor Osborne has come under growing pressure from MPs and peers to split up Royal Bank of Scotland . He argued that creating a ‘bad bank’ which would continue to be owned by the state would not inflict more harm on the economy or British taxpayers. The forthright letter was signed by all ten members of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, including the Archbishop of Canterbury and former chancellor Lord Lawson. Lawson has led calls to split RBS into a ‘good’ bank to boost lending to the economy and a ‘bad’ bank, which will house all its toxic assets and loans. The idea is the good bank will also be easier to sell back to the private sector. At his annual Mansion House speech in June, Chancellor George Osborne launched into an independent inquiry into the merits of the radical move. Osborne had previously been vehemently opposed to a break up, arguing it would be too time consuming, expensive and complicated. But he caved in to pressure when the banking commission, which he set up in the wake of the Libor interest rate rigging scandal, demanded an independent enquiry. In an open letter Andrew Tyrie, chair of the influential banking commission, said 'all the options' for the state backed lender¿s future should be 'examined as a matter of urgency' The forthright letter was signed by all ten members of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, including the Archbishop of Canterbury . In a letter to the Financial Times, Tyrie ratcheted up the pressure on Osborne for a split and raised concerns that the inquiry is conducted free of political influence. This is being conducted by blue blooded investment bank Rothschild and fund manager BlackRock. Lord Lawson has led calls to split RBS into a 'good' bank to boost lending to the economy and a 'bad bank', which will house all its toxic assets and loans . Tyrie said: ‘It is crucial that Rothschild approach this important work with a good deal of independence of mind. No obstacles would be put in the way of a full examination  of all aspects of such as split.’ Dismissing one of the main arguments voiced by opponents of the break up, he said: ‘Taking the ‘bad assets’ into a publicly owned entity at their true value does nothing to alter the underlying position of the economy, the public sector’s net worth, or the future burden of taxation.’ He added: ‘The chancellor’s review also needs to examine whether, over time, the taxpayer may in fact be better off as a result of the split.’ It is thought that Rothschild’s independent inquiry has produced little evidence so far that RBS is being restricted from lending by its toxic assets. RBS recently posted a profit of £1.4 billion in the first half of the year, rebounding from a £1.7 billion loss in the same period last year. In doing so it made two consecutive quarters of profit this year for the first time since the financial crisis. But almost five years on from its  £45.5 billion bail out, taxpayers are still sitting on a £15.6 billion loss as the share price has slumped. The bank has also had to fend off criticism that it has been starving small businesses of loans and recently launched an independent inquiry to investigate the allegations. Both Osborne and David Cameron had indicated that they wanted to sell RBS back to the  private sector before the 2015 General Election. But the Coalition is thought to be increasingly resigned to the fact that this will not happen. Earlier this month business secretary Vince Cable warned that it is ‘pretty unrealistic’ that taxypayer’s 81pc stake in RBS will be sold off within the next five years.","Andrew Tyrie, chair of banking commission, said it was 'matter of urgency'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:52 EST, 29 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:16 EST, 30 August 2013 . Top secret documents leaked by Edward Snowden have revealed how a clandestine NSA unit helped bug phones to locate Osama Bin Laden, a previously undisclosed lab helped confirm his DNA and the SEALS who raided his compound were guided from space. According to a packet of classified intelligence documents that were leaked to the Washington Post by former NSA contractor-turned-Russian émigré Edward Snowden, the successful raid on Bin Laden's lair was made possible in part thanks to a team of top secret operatives known as the Tailored Access Operation group. The elite hackers are tasked with breaking into computers and cell phone networks and installing spyware and locator devices. Such implants on devices owned by Al Qaeda officials were crucial to enabling the Bin Laden raid, according to the Post. Documents also reveal the existence of a top secret lab Defense Intelligence Agency Lab holding Bin Laden's DNA that was able to confirm his identity within hours, and that a network of NSA satellites guided the SEALs on the raid and intercepted communications from the surrounding area. Operation Neptune Spear: Leaked top secret intelligence documents revealed that the NSA played a key role in the mission to find Osama Bin Laden by tracking cell phones of al-Qaeda operatives . Found: An aerial view of the Abbottabad compound Bin Laden was hiding in . The newspaper reported Thursday that the . CIA was then able to identify the location of one of the cell phones . belonging to an al-Qaeda operative, which was linked to the walled-in . home in the affluent suburb of Abbottabad. The classified information about the lead-up to the 2011 raid carried out by SEAL Team 6 was mentioned in the 2013 fiscal 'black budget' for the U.S. intelligence community. The leaked documents, which include pie charts and graphs, show that the 16 agencies received nearly $53billion, with the biggest share of the budget - $14.7bllion - going to the CIA. The NSA got $10.8billion, nearly half of which was spent on collecting, processing and analysing data. Renegade: The classified documents detailing the 2013 fiscal budget for U.S. intelligence agencies was leaked to the Washington Post by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden . The secret documents filled in some gaps in information about the May 2011 raid, detailing how the operation was guided from space by satellites, which collected electronic data from Pakistan while the mission was in progress. While the 178-page 'black budget' is . scant on details, the fiscal documents mentioned that an NSA branch . known as the Tailored Access Operation group was responsible for . installing spyware and tracking devices to collect data from cell phones . used by al-Qaeda operatives. The budget also shows that a U.S. military laboratory in Afghanistan analysed DNA from Bin Laden's corpse and confirmed his identity shortly after he was killed. The Pentagon denied more than a year ago it had any records of these tests in a response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by The Associated Press a day after President Barack Obama announced Bin Laden's death. The Post reported that a forensic intelligence laboratory run by the Defense Intelligence Agency performed the DNA testing eight hours after the right, and the tests 'provided a conclusive match.' The AP's request for records submitted on May 2, 2011, included DNA and facial recognition tests performed to ensure the body was Bin Laden's, all videos and photographs taken during the raid on Bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, the death certificate and other records related to the mission. In a March 2012 response, the Defense Department said it could not locate any of the files. Secret lair: Thanks to the data gathered by the NSA, the CIA was able to identify the location of one of the cell phones linked to a walled-in home in the affluent suburb of Abbottabad, Pakistan . Eyes in the sky: The documents stated that the raid on Bin Laden's compound was guided from space by satellites . Positive ID: A U.S. military laboratory in Afghanistan analysed DNA from Bin Laden's corpse and confirmed his identity . The AP reported in July that the nation's top special operations commander, Adm. William McRaven, had ordered military files about the raid purged from Defense Department computers and sent to the CIA, where they more easily could be shielded from ever being made public. The secret move appeared to have sidestepped federal rules and perhaps the Freedom of Information Act as well. The CIA has special authority to prevent the release of 'operational files' in ways that can't effectively be challenged in federal court. Spokesmen for the Pentagon and CIA denied the move was intended to avoid the legal requirements of the FOIA. The Bin Laden mission was overseen by the CIA, they said, which meant the records about the raid should be housed with the spy agency. Secret force: An NSA branch known as the Tailored Access Operation group was responsible for installing spyware and tracking devices as part of the hunt for Bin Laden .

Pensioner Jose Hampson leaves court on her Zimmer frame after being found guilty of racially abusing a family of gypsies . A grandmother aged 78 was yesterday convicted of racially abusing a family of gipsies as a long-running dispute over an illegal caravan site boiled over. Former Sunday school teacher and community stalwart José Hampson claimed she was sworn at and intimidated when she backed her Jaguar through the gates of their camp to turn it around. But the respected toyshop owner was fingerprinted and ordered to provide a DNA sample after the gipsies told police she had shouted racist abuse at them. Yesterday she found herself with a criminal record for the first time in her life after a district judge rejected her account and found her guilty of racially-aggravated harassment. Afterwards the widow - who arrived at court in a wheelchair after suffering a fall - said she was 'stunned' by the verdict and said she was considering lodging an appeal. The ex-school governor claimed she was driving back from the toyshop she has run for six decades in a Lancashire market town when she found the narrow lane to her home of 40 years partially blocked by a van. She said she had previously seen it parked on an illegal traveller site built on green belt land beside the lane which the local council has spent tens of thousands of pounds in an unsuccessful attempt to evict. The former secretary of the local chamber of trade told Preston magistrates court she scraped her car trying to squeeze past, so decided to reverse back down the lane and turn around in the entrance to the site then return to nearby Chorley. Hampson told the court one of the Romany gipsies who owns the camp, Michael Linfoot, came running over shouting: 'What the f****** hell are you doing on my land?' The 5ft pensioner claimed she felt 'intimidated' by Mr Linfoot and his 72-year-old father-in-law Walter Bird 'towering' over her but told them: 'You're not supposed to be on this land, it's green belt.' Hampson claimed the only time she swore was when she asked them what the 'f****** nuisance' was about, and denied using racist language before she drove off. However Mr Linfoot told the court he had merely walked over to see why she had driven onto the plot and that Hampson confronted him over the damage her car had suffered. The self-employed builder said he had told her the van blocking the lane wasn't his, at which she started 'shouting and screaming' and saying: 'Look at my f****** wheel.' Mr Linfoot said he again denied responsibility, at which she said: 'I'm f****** sick of you lot, you're illegal, you should all f*** off you dirty f****** gypos.' 'Romany gipsies are probably the only ethnic minorities left that still gets abused - people think it's ok,' he told the court. Victim: Patty Linfoot . Abused: Husband Michael Linfoot . Insulted: Walter Bird . 'My mother-in-law's a similar age and if she came out with that sort of language I'd be disgusted.' Mr Bird's wife Sylvia, who was watching from beside her caravan, told the court: 'My husband was so upset I had to make him a cup of tea.' Shortly afterwards the Linfoot family called the police who took statements from both sides, and Hampson was charged with racially abusing them. Vindicated: Patty Linfoot and her mother Sylvia Bird leave court after their abuser Jose Hampson was fined nearly £700 and ordered to pay costs . She denied his account, telling yesterday's trial: 'I would never dream of using language like that.' Her solicitor, James Towey, suggested in cross-examination that Mr Linfoot had made up his account to discredit local residents opposed to the camp, pointing out he had told police: 'If we can stop one of them, it may have the desired effect on the others'. However the father-of-three insisted Hampson had 'lost it' during the incident in April and caused him and his father-in-law distress. Deputy district judge James Hatton . said he found it 'improbable' that Hampson wouldn't have simply driven . off had she felt as intimidated as she claimed, describing the evidence . given by Mr Linfoot and his family as 'cogent and believable'. He . told her he was convinced that 'in the heat of the moment you have lost . your temper and used the language described in court today'. Finding . her guilty of using racially aggravated threatening words or behaviour, . he fined her £690 and ordered to pay her £620 prosecution costs plus a . £69 victims' surcharge. Afterwards Hampson, of Heath Charnock, said she hoped to lodge an appeal. 'I'm . absolutely stunned but I'm considering the way forward - it's taken a . lot out of me,' she said. 'I know perfectly well that I'm innocent.' Chorley council has set aside £145,000 in a vain battle to evict the . Linfoots since they moved onto the plot in 2009, provoking anger towards . the family from some local residents. They . refused to move despite being denied planning permission and being . served with an enforcement order, but were recently given a two-year . reprieve after successfully arguing there wasn't enough provision for . travellers in the area.

Controversy: A tweet by Evan Davis provoked a quick response from the Latvian Institute . When BBC broadcaster Evan Davis bumped into a ‘lovely guy’ at a barbecue, he decidedto help him out. He called on his 125,000 Twitter followers to find the migrant worker a job so he would not have to return home to Latvia. What he did not expect was for his good deed to land him in hot water with the Latvian authorities – who accused him of comparing their country to the evil realm of Mordor in Lord of the Rings. The Dragons’ Den and Today programme host met unemployed Constantin Jenson, 35, ata friend’s house last weekend. The aspiring actor had been living in London for two-and-a-half months and was struggling to find a job. Davis, 51, posted a picture of him on Twitter with the words: ‘Can anyone give this lovely guy I met at a bbq yesterday a job? Hospitality perhaps? Or he has to return to Latvia.’ However, the Latvian Institute, a body set up by Latvia’s government to promote ‘positive awareness’ of the country abroad, did not approve of his suggestion that returning home to the Baltic state would be an ordeal. It said: ‘Latvia is not Mordor. Economy is on the rise for the 12th consecutive quarter, and unemployment is down and the country is gorgeous’. Helping hand: Evan Davis' tweet, pictured, was meant as an act of kindness but was seen as casting aspersions on an entire nation by Latvian authorities . Despite Davis’s helping hand, Mr Jenson was unsuccessful in his job hunt and is expected to return to Latvia today, having run out of savings. He insisted his stay in the UK had been a ‘fun experience’ and thanked the presenter for trying to help him. The Latvian Institute's public relations officer Karlis Pots told MailOnline: 'It was all . meant in good fun. We thought the final part of his tweet ""or he has to . return to Lativa"" sounded a bit dramatic... It was a bit like ""or else"". 'We wanted to portray that everything is not perfect but is improving economically wise. On the up: Latvian authorities were keen to point out the country, of which Riga, pictured, is the capital, were booming . Not Latvia: The country's authorities insisted Latvia was not Mordor, pictured, but instead a thriving, vibrant economy . Setting the record straight: The Latvian Institute was quick to react to Evan Davis' tweet, with a tweet of their own, stating that the country was actually booming . 'We . are not annoyed with Mr Davis, it's not at all that. We just wanted to . let him know maybe he should choose his phrasing a little better. It . sounds a bit overly dramatic.

'I'm not saying everything is . fine and dandy, there is work to be done, but if there is a chance to . combat misconceptions about the country, then we'll take it.'

There are historical allies and there are strong allies, and John Kerry may have confused the two yesterday when he hailed France as America’s oldest friend. It was supposed to be a calculated snub to Britain, of course. With a few exceptions, in the past 100 years it’s become a rule of thumb that America no longer goes to war without Britain at its side. Francophile: Secretary of State John Kerry was mocked for his Francophilia during the 2004 presidential race. Yesterday he called them America's 'oldest ally' as he hailed the government for supporting Syria strikes . So the UK’s failure to follow the US into action over Syria inevitably stung in Washington, prompting Mr Kerry to cosy up to France. But in reality Americans tend to mistrust the French even more than the British do. Famously, Americans refer to them as ‘cheese-eating surrender monkeys’. And French-speaking Mr Kerry was mocked for his Francophilia during the 2004 presidential race. The relationship had started well. French troops and ships under the Marquis de Lafayette provided crucial . help during America’s war of independence from Britain. Links were strengthened by Founding Father Thomas Jefferson, who lived in Paris as US ambassador. A good start: French forces helped Americans secede from Britain and Founding Father Thomas Jefferson (pictured) lived for a while in Paris... But the friendship crumpled when Napoleon took power and resented America’s treaty-making with Britain. By 1798 a state of undeclared war existed between the two former allies. In the 1840s, France supported Texas’s moves for independence from the US and blocked American moves to gain control of California. The situation became even worse during . the American Civil War. While France was technically neutral, Napoleon . III favoured the Confederates. It managed to antagonise the US further by installing the Austrian archduke Maximilian of Hapsburg on the throne of Mexico. America, which wanted French troops out of Mexico, refused to recognise the government. In the 20th century France and the . United States got on a little better, but relations were strained . between Franklin D Roosevelt and Charles de Gaulle during the Second . World War. De Gaulle and his . Free French refused to take part in the Normandy landings but the . Allies still generously allowed French troops to be the first to . liberate Paris. After De Gaulle became president, he clashed with the US over France’s decision to build its own nuclear weapons. ... but Napoleon, left, resented America's treaty-making with Britain in the 18th century, while in the 20th, President Charles de Gaulle, right, clashed with the U.S. over nuclear weapons and took his country out of Nato . In 1966, France pulled its forces out of Nato and kicked the US-led organisation out of its HQ at Fontainebleau. France earned its ‘surrender monkey’ moniker during the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. The French opposed a UN resolution authorising the invasion and, in retaliation, anti-French feeling swept across the US with public campaigns to boycott French goods.",History of French relations with U.S. hardly one of unwavering support .

But this dust devil was spotted by a man in a field round the back of his house - near Basingstoke. Kevin Farndell filmed the whirlwind whipping up straw and soil to around 100ft in the air in Dummer, Hampshire. Scroll down for video . In a whirl: Kevin Farndell's video now features on the Met Office site . The 63-year-old filmed the natural phenomenon for about 45 seconds on his mobile phone. He uploaded it onto his Facebook page and YouTube. Mr Farndell said: 'I couldn’t believe it when I saw it - I’ve never seen anything like it. 'I just came round the corner and could see a vortex going round about 40ft away. 'There wasn’t any wind and it was perfectly still, but I could see this straw flying up in the air. 'There had obviously just been a harvest and the straw was all lined up. 'It was like a mini tornado - a very British tornado.' Dust devils are formed when hot air rises quickly through a small pocket of cooler, low-pressure air above it. If conditions are right, the air starts to rotate. More hot air rushes in towards the developing vortex to replace the air that is rising and the spinning intensifies, leading to a chimney-like funnel through which hot air travels upwards and in a circular motion. The column is kept stable - for a time at least - by the cool air that stops rising within the spinning outer wall of hot air. The spinning also causes the column to move forward. Dust devils usually end very suddenly when surrounding cold air starts to be sucked in, often if they are not moving quickly enough or if they hit an area of cooler terrain. Flat and barren land, light winds, cool atmospheric temperatures and clear skies are the optimum conditions for dust devils to occur. Funnel: The rising and falling column of hot air whips up debris in its path . Mr Farndell said: 'It was an amazing . sight but it was going so high up in the air - I was a bit worried about . what would happen if any of the straw got sucked into an aircraft. 'The reaction I’ve had to the footage has been brilliant - everyone’s been saying how amazing the dust devil looks.' They are not generally powerful enough to cause extensive damage, as they are often less than 3ft in diameter, with an average maximum wind speed of 45mph. However, some have been recorded reaching a diameter of 300ft, with winds over 60mph and lasting more than 20 minutes - and some injuries and even deaths have occurred. In 2000, a dust devil destroyed a fairground in Arizona, U.S. and injured several people, and in 2003, a roof was lifted off a building in Maine, killing a man inside. Dust devils have also contributed to more than 100 air accidents - some fatal. Dust devils have also been recorded on the surface of Mars.","Dust devil filmed near Dummer, Hampshire .

After problems with travellers trying to set themselves up in a public park over the summer, a council took the step of locking the main gates to keep them out. But, as a fresh convoy of 30 caravans arrived, such common sense was clearly no match for the warped logic of health and safety. Astonishingly, officials decided to unlock the vehicle access gate – because they were worried the intruders might hurt themselves during their efforts to get in. Open season: The gate which was erected to keep travellers out has now been opened amid health and safety fears . Setting up camp: Scores of caravans are now settled across Wild Park near Brighton . Advice: Police had warned the council that it was not safe for travellers to keep trying to access the site around the barrier . The travellers duly made themselves at . home – and because the council voluntarily let them in, police have . lost all powers to evict them. Taxpayers . will instead now have to fund a lengthy civil court battle to throw out . the intruders from Wild Park, on the outskirts of Brighton. The . farce emerged in a leaked confidential email by Brighton and Hove . Council to councillors. It said: ‘After the initial trespass was . reported, Sussex Police highlighted the dangerous nature with which the . group were accessing the field. ‘As . such a decision was taken to open the access gate to reduce the risk to . road users and to stop the occupants from crossing the pavement to . access the road.’ Local . residents say they are now unable to use the park, Brighton and Hove’s . largest local nature reserve, and fear it could become ‘a new Dale . Farm’, the illegal Essex camp of 1,000 travellers which cost millions of . pounds to break up. Delighted: Travellers have set up camp at Wild Park, Brighton, after being let into the site by council officials . Crazy: Critics have described the decision to open the gate and let travellers in as 'madness' At the . start of the summer, the council padlocked the gates to Wild Park after . itinerants had to be removed. About 30 caravans arrived and the . travellers, determined to gain access, repeatedly drove over pavements . and mounds designed as obstructions. It was then, last week, that the . Green Party-led council decided to open the gates to reduce risk to the . public and the travellers themselves. More than 30 caravans are now . camped on the land, with more feared over the weekend. Inspector . Bill Whitehead of Sussex Police said if the gates had remained locked, . any travellers could have been evicted immediately because they would . have been committing an offence under Section 61 of the Criminal Justice . and Public Order Act. But because the council had let them in, the . section no longer applies. Tory . councillor Dawn Barnett said last night: ‘The council is mad. They have . opened the flood gates. The kids who live nearby can’t play in the park . any more because it’s not safe. I am terrified it may turn into another .

An amateur fisherman snared himself an unusual catch - a haul of Roman and Iron Age coins, hailed by the British Museum as a 'very excting discovery'. Jason Hemmings usually spends his time plucking sea bass from the ocean. But, having recently bought a metal detector and taken up treasure hunting as a hobby, he struck gold in a field in Owermoigne, Dorset, finding 15 bronze and silver coins that may have been lying there for 2,000 years. Mr Hemmings, 41, began his hobby when he purchased the detector for £300 from a friend who wanted to upgrade his own. After scouring the field, he unearthed . the first coin and, initially, that seemed to be it. 'I had a quick . search and couldn’t find anything else,' he said. 'I had to go home for Sunday roast. But I went back the next day, and that’s when I came across more.' The . machine was giving off such faint, intermittent signals that his friend . did not think it was worth the effort of digging, but he persevered,. and the rest is history. He followed the required . procedure in reporting the discovery under the Portable Antiquities . Scheme, which encourages the voluntary recording of archaeological . objects found by members of the public in England and Wales. The local finds liaison officer realised its significance immediately. Although its financial value is low – just a few hundred pounds - the hoard is historically very important.

Pot luck: Mr Hemmings made the amazing discovery just weeks after he bought a metal detector from a friend for £300. The piece on the left shows the bare head of Claudius I .

'Hoards which can be dated with confidence to the early years of the Claudian conquest are incredibly rare,' said Ms Ghey. The . coins amount to 4.25 denarii which would have paid for about a week’s . food for a soldier - one denarius would have bought eight loaves of . bread.

She has now researched her ancestors to help her build her indigenous studies course at Melbourne. 'One of the primary motivations behind my aspirations to attend Cambridge was so my perspective would be respected and my voice would be more readily listened to. “I also felt that it would be useful to learn more about the theory and philosophy that underpin the education system within much of the Western world, and that perhaps this would also contribute to furthering my understanding of why the exclusion of Aboriginal people continues to occur within this space.” Lilly was awarded the Charlie Perkins scholarship, named after Australia’s first Aboriginal university graduate who finished his degree in 1966.

The family of 15-year-old Bart Palosz says he committed suicide after the first day of school because of bullying. The sophomore shot himself to death Wednesday only hours after the first day of his sophomore year at Greenwich High School in Connecticut. Family told local media that bullying led him to end his life. A series of posts on social media hinted at the teen’s depression, but family and friends were unaware until it was too late. A tragedy that could have been avoided: Bart Palosz, 15, pictured with sister Beata Palosz . Crushed: Beata Palosz and her family held a funeral Friday for Bart Palosz, his body will be flown back to Poland for burial . A victim of relentless bullying, the troubled teen took his own life after earlier in the day pleading with his mother to let him stay home, according to the Connecticut Post. ‘It’s just a really horrific tragedy and I’m deeply saddened to hear of it,” Greenwich First Selectman Peter Tesei said during a Wednesday night news conference. Bullies taunted him every day for the past 10 years, Bart’s sister Beata Palosz told the Post. From smashing a brand new cell phone on the floor, to bashing his head into a locker and pushing him into thorny bushes on a daily basis, the torture was unending – and Bart chose to stay silent. ‘He didn't make fun or make jokes about other people. That's where the bullying started because he was mature enough to let it happen and not say anything,’ Beata Palosz told the Post. In the dark: The family was unaware of his series of troubling posts to Google+ . An outcast: Bart Palosz had a hard time making friends, was ostracized for being different . Being taller than other students, having acne and an accent – the Palosz family immigrated from Poland 11 years ago – made life difficult for the teen. When Bart Palosz brand new cell phone was smashed on the floor and he was pushed down a staircase at school, he did nothing. ‘Hey if I were to stab my eye out due to school caused insanity, who would miss me?’ Bart Palosz asked in a post on Google+ while putting a knife to his eye in a picture. ‘I would look at his computer sometimes because he left it unlocked sometimes and to check on him I would read his email,’ Beata Palosz told the paper. ‘He was talking about happy things. It seemed like he had friends to talk to. I didn't think I needed to look further.’ Shell shocked: Greenwich High School students arriving find out Bart Palosz has taken his life because of bullying . The school's fault: Bart Palosz's family blames Greenwich High School for his suicide, saying administrators did nothing to stop the torment . It was only after police alerted the family to the series of posts that they became aware of them, the Post reported. ‘I have chosen to go with 3 peoples (sic) advice and kill myself,’ he wrote in a now-deleted post, adding that he had just swallowed pills. ‘I just wish it was faster.’ That attempt was unsuccessful. ‘does anyone know if you can light a 12 gauge shotgun shell(slug not pellets) with a lighter?’ Bart Palosz asked on Google+ in July. The family brought the bullying to the school’s attention, but they do not believe proper action was taken, even declining to show surveillance video of an incident where Bart Palosz’s head was split open after being thrown into a locker, Beata told the Post. He did not want to go: Bart Palosz begged his mother Wednesday to let him stay home from school . A sad, isolated young man: Bart Palosz was quiet and did not defend himself . Bart Palosz’s injuries required a visit to the hospital, the school called it an accident, his sister said.‘It pretty much was, `Say you're sorry,' and that's it… I honestly do not think the school addressed the bullying. It could have saved him if they did.’ Citing the ongoing police investigation, Greenwich Public Schools are staying quiet, and have declined multiple media requests for comment. ‘I notice if I sound sad I'm normal and if I act happy, cheerful, and ""normal"" there is a high chance that I will try to poison myself, cut myself, commit suicide, or jump in front of a truck  :)’ Bart Palosz posted to Google+ in July. Despite the abuse, the family thought he had turned a corner in the past year, according to his sister. Having lost weight and even making some friends, they thought he was finally starting to fit in. ‘someone make sure if I ever die I get buried listening to this song,’ he posted only two weeks ago to Google+. Bart Palosz wanted to study computer programming at New York University, his sister told the Post. Instead, a funeral is being held Friday and his heartbroken family will fly his body back to Poland for burial.","Bart Palosz, 15, was bullied for being tall, heavy, having acne and being from Poland .

Andy Murray, pictured outside 10 Downing Street after winning Wimbledon this year, could lose £500,000 due to a planning setback . He can't seem to stop winning on the court, but Andy Murray has suffered a blow off it after it emerged he is set to lose £500,000 because of botched investment plans in a new Surrey golf course. The tennis star, who won Wimbledon this summer and is currently competing in the US Open championships he triumphed at last year, invested the money for the planned course and spa at Cherkley Court in Leatherhead, Surrey. Beaverbrook Golf Club would have been the 141st course in the county, where Murray lives with his girlfriend, Kim Sears, but 10 days ago a High Court judge quashed the planning permission granted to developers Longshot Ltd, according to The Independent. The firm must now restore the course site to its original condition, unless it lodges a successful appeal. The cost, thought to be hundreds of thousands, will be added to legal costs and loss of income if the course is not built. Despite the potential loss, Murray, who reached the third round of the US Open last night, is not short of cash. Winning Wimbledon added a cool £1.6million to his near-£30million career prize money, while the allure of working with Britain's first SW19 champion since 1936 has proved too much for sponsors, which now include Rado, Adidas and the Royal Bank of Scotland. And last year it was revealed the Scot had invested in a rambling hotel in his native Dunblane. Another who could potentially lose out on the failed golf course project is advertising mogul Sir Frank Lowe, who invested £250,000, which planned to turn the home of the late press baron Lord Beaverbrook, Cherkley Court near Leatherhead, into a hotel and spa, with the golf course. Murray had wanted to turn Cherkley Court in Leatherhead, Surrey, into a golf club and spa but a judge quashed the planning permission . The country house is near where Murray lives with girlfriend Kim Sears, right, in Surrey . But another major loser will be the unique chalklands of the Leatherhead Downs, which some feel may never recover from the damage already done. Mole Valley District Council allowed the project last year against the advice of its planning officers and warnings from environmental experts. Local campaigners challenged the decision in the High Court and won. Mr Justice Haddon-Cave found the council’s decision to grant planning permission on such an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty was perverse, and that the council had 'erred in law'. The requirement to restore the site arises because Longshot decided to carry on as if its planning permission were unassailable, and cleared meadows. Environmental law specialist Richard Buxton, for the campaigners, obtained legal undertakings from Longshot to undo any damage if it lost. 'It is particularly gratifying having the court so explicitly recognising that what may be profitable for developers is not necessarily in the public interest,' he said. Murray, in winning action at the US Open last night, has had little to scowl about on the court in the last year, winning Wimbledon, last year's US Open and the Olympics . Longshot said it  was 'amazed' and 'appalled' at the ruling. The judge denied leave to appeal, but the firm is expected to try anyway. Professor David Hawksworth CBE, a former Council of English Nature member and a local resident, said there should have been no 'physical disturbance or spraying' without 'scientific assessment' of the site by skilled specialists. John Northcott, portfolio holder of planning at Mole Valley District Council, said: 'We will now need to take time to consider what our next steps will be.'",Tennis hero thwarted in bid for new course in Leatherhead after judge quashes planning permission .

Graphic diary entries that allegedly detail how a suspected serial killer stalked and raped his victims have been read out in court during the closing arguments of his trial. Joseph Naso, 79, allegedly wrote descriptions of rapes and sexual assaults in the journal as far back as the 1950s, Marin County prosecutor Rosemary Slote said as she read from the journal's pages. They allegedly contain accounts of Naso approaching women and offering them a ride home. 'Outside the front door I overpowered her and ravaged her,' read one entry set in London, the Marin Independent Journal reported. 'I couldn't help myself.' Accused: Joseph Naso, 79, stands accused of killing four women between the 1970s and 1990s . Closing arguments: At his trial on Wednesday, Deputy District Attorney Rosemary Slote read from Naso's journal that allegedly gives details of how he stalked and raped numerous women . Other passages described incidents in Cleveland, Kansas City, Buffalo, Rochester, New York, Wichita, Kansas, and Berkeley, California. Naso, a former photographer from Reno, Nevada, stands accused of killing four prostitutes, all of whom had matching first and last initials - earning the case the moniker, the Double Initial killings. He is charged with killing Roxene Roggasch in 1977, Carmen Colon in 1978, Pamela Parsons in 1993 and Tracy Tafoya in 1994. He has pleaded not guilty to the murders. Prosecutors have called some 70 . witnesses during the two-month trial as they sought to prove that Naso . drugged and photographed his victims before strangling them. Victims: Naso is accused of killing (clockwise from top left) 18-year-old Roxene Roggasch; 22-year-old Carmen Colon; 38-year-old Pamela Parsons, and 31-year-old Tracy Tafoya . The court has previously heard entries allegedly written in Naso's journal. At his preliminary hearing last year, it was claimed that in entry after . entry, Naso wrote how he would stalk and approach a . woman, offer her a ride home and then 'put it to her', often in his car. Another read: 'Girl in north Buffalo woods. She was real pretty. Had to knock her out first.' Nevada Department of Public Safety Det. Richard Brown said the journal was filled with such descriptions, and . that Naso used the word rape in other sections. Naso was arrested after a routine . check by probation officers of his Reno home in 2010 turned up numerous . photographs of unconscious women in various states of undress. In court: Naso, pictured with his public defender in April, could face the death penalty if convicted . Investigators also discovered DNA matching Naso's profile on at least one victim, Roggasch. Naso characterized the photographs as his art and said all of his 'models' were willing participants. In a bedroom in his home, . investigators also found a 'List of 10' with written descriptions of 10 . women, including four references that prosecutors believe described his . four victims. Six other women referred to on the list have not yet been identified, but prosecutors say the investigation is ongoing. Naso is acting as his own attorney and . is scheduled to give his closing argument on Friday. He could face the . death penalty if convicted. Interruption: The trial was briefly stopped after a truck was found with the message 'Joseph Naso murdered by sister' scrawled across a back window in the jury parking lot . Plot: Larry Roggasch, whose sister Roxene was allegedly killed by Naso, said he just wanted to raise money . During his trial, he showed the jury dozens of photographs he took of weddings, landscapes and family members along with what he called 'glamour' or 'cheesecake' photographs of nude women. He said he never forced any of them to do anything. Prosecutors, however, claimed he kept a list of his victims and mementos of his crimes. Closing arguments were delayed briefly as the court investigated a truck bearing the words 'Joseph Naso killed my sister' that was parked in the jury lot.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 10:50 EST, 15 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:51 EST, 15 August 2013 . David C. Jones, a retired Air Force general, has died, aged 92 . David C. Jones, a retired Air Force general who helped set in motion a far-reaching reorganization of the U.S. military command while serving as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has died at 92. The general's son, David Curtis Jones, said yesterday that his father died Saturday at a military retirement community in Potomac Falls, Virginia. He had Parkinson's disease. Jones served longer than any predecessor on the Joint Chiefs, first as the Air Force chief of staff and then as chairman from 1978 to 1982, The New York Times reported. He appeared on the cover of Time magazine in October 1979, with the magazine describing him as 'cool, meticulous, low-key and dogged.' The article said 'Jones typifies the new breed of military managers.' Near the end of his second two-year term, Jones recommended a sweeping reorganization of the nation's military command, moving to strengthen the chairman's role while curbing rivalry among the services. Many of his suggestions were included in the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act, which streamlined the military chain of command. Retired Gen. John Pustay, who served as an assistant to Jones, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Jones was 'a very, very visionary, sharp, perceptive guy — somebody who could always see further down the path than others.' Pustay said Jones helped move the services away from being parochial to a more joint perspective. He said the two stayed in touch, getting together weekly in later years at the military retirement community in northern Virginia where they lived. Under Jones' watch, the Carter administration also undertook a failed attempt to rescue 53 American hostages being held in Iran in 1980. Eight U.S. servicemen died when a helicopter crashed into a C-130 transport plane at a staging area in Iran. 'He was really devastated about that,' said Jones' daughter, Kathy Franklin of Silver Spring, Md. Defense Secretary Casper Weinberger (pictured right) and Air Force General David C. Jones (left), on Capitol Hill in Washington in March, 1981 . She said that while Jones understood that unexpected bad weather was a factor, he also felt that the rescue attempt was impaired by the lack of a joint command to train and exercise forces for such missions. 'That propelled a lot of his passion for Goldwater-Nichols...creating more joint connections in the military,' she said. David Charles Jones was born in Aberdeen, S.D., in 1921. After the family moved to Minot, N.D., he often rode his bicycle to a nearby airfield and dreamed of becoming a pilot. He attended the University of North Dakota and Minot State College, dropping out during World War II to enlist in the Army Air Corps. He received his commission and pilot wings in February 1943, then trained pilots at air bases in the U.S. During the Korean War, he flew more than 300 B-29 bomber missions over North Korea and also flew aerial tankers for midair refueling. After the war, he served for two years as a top aide to Gen. Curtis LeMay, an architect of U.S. air attacks during World War II and then the commander of the Strategic Air Command. In 1960, Jones graduated from the National War College. Four years later, he decided at age 43 that he wanted to learn to fly fighters. 'He did better than some of the young guys in his class and he got a wing,' said Franklin, who also noted that her father rose from colonel to four-star general in 5 ½ years. CIA Director William Colby (left), and other attendees of a top-secret National Security Council meeting are shown military options by General David Jones relating to the capture of the SS Mayaguez in May, 1975 in Washington DC . Franklin described her father as a self-made man who read voraciously, particularly about management, and managed to become Joint Chiefs chairman despite having not graduated from college or one of the service academies. 'This was rather unheard-of,' she said. According to the Air Force website, Jones served in Vietnam as deputy commander for operations and then as vice commander of the Seventh Air Force. He later commanded U.S. Air Forces in Europe, receiving a fourth star in 1971. Three years later, President Richard Nixon tapped Jones to be Air Force chief of staff. He led a reorganization of the command structure. President Jimmy Carter appointed Jones as Joint Chiefs chairman in 1978 and again in 1980. Jones accompanied Carter to Vienna for SALT II talks with the Soviet Union in 1979, and after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, helped transform a rapid deployment force for southwest Asia that Carter established into a regional unified command. According to The Times, some Republican senators criticized Jones for publicly backing Carter's cancellation of the B-1 bomber, among other policies. But Jones said he felt he had a constitutional obligation to support civilian superiors publicly even if he offered different advice in private. Still, Franklin said, 'He really loved working with President Carter.' She also has more personal memories of her father, such as when the legendary World War II general Omar Bradley was in a wheelchair and 'my dad took him all around the Pentagon when he was chairman.' Jones' son David said he was in high school when his father was Joint Chiefs chairman, but that his father put family first. 'We did so much together,' recalled the younger Jones, of Sterling, Va. 'Every moment he had he was not at work, he'd devote to family.' He recalled his father being 'extremely honest' and 'larger than life' to him. Jones completed his second term as Joint Chiefs chairman during the Reagan administration, and retired from the military in July 1982. Jones was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the board of the American Red Cross. He also served on the boards of General Electric and Youth Service, USA, Inc., and was on the Council on Foreign Relations. Jones' wife of 67 years, Lois, died in 2009 . In addition to Franklin and David Jones, the general is survived by a daughter, Susan Coffin of Scottsdale, Ariz., a sister, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Burial will be at Arlington National Cemetery.","David C. Jones suffered from Parkinson's disease .

Spared jail: Would-be teacher Abi Ellis appearing at Truro Crown Court after attacking another girl on a night out by biting her face . A pretty undergraduate and wannabe teacher who has twice BITTEN women in the face during boozed up brawls has been spared jail. Violent Abi Ellis, 20, sank her teeth into startled Katie Roberts during her most recent attack - after the two women clashed outside a nightclub. Ellis is prone to losing her temper and when she does she likes to lash out and 'bite', a court was told. The latest 'violent and extremely antisocial' assault left Miss Roberts with a gaping wound to her cheek which later became infected. Both girls had gone to Falmouth School but the former pupils were not friends, Truro Crown Court in Cornwall heard. The pair were attending separate birthday parties when Ellis spilt a drink on Miss Roberts and they exchanged words. Trouble flared again outside Truro’s L2 nightspot when Katie went to get in a pre-booked taxi with her brother - only to find Ellis in the vehicle. But when Katie asked Ellis what she was doing, the brunette attacked her and bit into her left cheek. She was found guilty of causing actual bodily harm, ordered to carry out a community order for 12 months, undertake 180 hours unpaid work and pay her victim £500. The court heard Ellis had been cautioned by police in June 2011 for a similar incident involving another girl. Thomas Bradnock, prosecuting, said: 'You bit her I suggest because that is what you do when you lose your temper, isn’t it? You bite. 'It is what happened almost a year previously with a different girl.' Katie told the court: 'I was obviously very shocked that she was in my brother’s taxi and I said, ‘what is she doing?’ 'She launched at me and by that time her teeth were in my cheek and gripped on very tightly. I touched my cheek and there was blood on my hand. I was very emotional.' Scene: The disagreement occurred outside Truro's L2 nightclub, which resulted in Ms Ellis biting a fellow reveller's cheek . The wound later became infected and Katie, reported the attack shortly after it happened on December 18, 2011. Ellis spent Christmas in Ireland before travelling to Thailand, where she spent nine months teaching English, but was arrested upon her return. Mr Bradnock said Ellis had been cautioned by police in June 2011 for a similar incident involving another girl. He told her: 'You bit her I suggest because that is what you do when you lose your temper, isn’t it? You bite. It is what happened almost a year previously with a different girl.' Ellis, a Tesco receptionist about to start an English literature and language degree at Brighton University in just a few weeks, claimed the bite was in self defence. Recorder James Waddington told Ellis, of Falmouth, Cornwall, she had come close to going to jail. He said: 'The matter has taken a long time because you made yourself scarce after this incident. You decided to go out of the area, no doubt hoping that matters would calm down. 'Be in no doubt that this was a serious assault and it is futile trying to offload responsibility on to your unfortunate victim. It was wholly unacceptable, violent and extremely antisocial.'","Abi Ellis, 20, sank her teeth into startled Katie Roberts during her most recent attack .

In a horrifying twist, the young mother, who had prepared so excitedly for her daughter's arrival, learned that she had contracted a rare, fast-spreading infection called necrotizing fasciitis. This is the deadly infection, also referred to as 'flesh-eating bacteria', attacks muscles and skin tissue, leaving its victims needing significant amputations. Around a quarter of victims die. The bacteria, most commonly A Streptococcus, is found naturally in the skin or throat and infections can usually be treated easily. New mother: This image shows Heather holding baby Ruby Ann just after she was born on August 1 . Gorgeous: Baby Ruby Ann, who is now two weeks old, was not harmed by her mother's infection . Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat. The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications. Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. But about a quarter of victims will lose their lives to the disease. But in some cases when it gets through a cut or a scrape, it can produce destructive toxins that infect the tissue - in what Matt called the 'perfect storm' of bacteria which 'came completely out of left field'. Heather underwent an operation to remove some of the decaying flesh, but her pain still continued. Doctors planned to take her from the intensive care unit to a Boston hospital for reconstructive surgery, but overnight the hospital called Matt to say she was deteriorating. They also told him to buy some baby formula as Heather's body was filled with medications and she would be unable to breastfeed baby Ruby Ann. He explained to the Bangor Daily News: 'From what we were being told and from what we were seeing, [Heather] didn't have long at all to live at that point.' At one point, Heather's stomach was . cut open to relieve pressure from fluid build-up. She only opened her . eyes once throughout the entire ordeal, her husband said. 'The way it was explained to me - that's . stuck with me quite a bit - was that the medicine in her body was . fighting to keep her alive but she was fighting to die,' he said. Aware . that she would not survive another surgery, he decided to remove her . tubes to make her feel comfortable before she passed away. The family . gathered and prayed around her as they said their goodbyes. Missed: The couple, from Bangor, Maine, had been married for two years and both worked in childcare . New mother: Heather, who had been excitedly preparing for the birth of her daughter for months, quickly deteriorated after contracting the disease and even surgeries could not stop it spreading . 'They said she fought it a lot . stronger than most people do,' said Matt, who married Heather just over two years ago after they met through a mutual friend. 'It was the same thing with . the pregnancy, there were doctors there... who said that she was one of . the toughest people they've ever seen at giving birth.' The hospital, while it cannot comment . on the specific case because of confidentiality, said that it will . review the case and see whether the incident was under the hospital's . control. It hopes to find . out where exactly the bacteria originated - outside the hospital, inside . or from a germ that was already in the patient's body, doctors said. Friends are also helping raise money for Heather's funeral costs at a GoFundMe page. More than $13,000 has already been raised, and any money left over will go to Ruby Ann's education. Newborn: Doctors said that Heather was one of the toughest people they'd seen give birth when she delivered Ruby Ann during a 20-hour labor on August 1 . Heather, who had dreams of opening a childcare center, was remembered as artistic and loving in her obituary. 'She was an outgoing personality, loved by all of her friends,' it noted. 'Heather opened her home to many, never turning down a friend in need.' Matt says he does not want to blame the hospital, but he does wish to raise awareness of the disease. 'In reality, it could happen to anyone, but it’s best to know ways to prevent it, as much as you can,' he said. 'I'm sure there are people trying to figure out how to prevent it and how to stop it, but it needs to be brought a little more to the forefront.' An episiotomy is a surgical incision in the perineum, the area between the vagina and the anus, made just before childbirth to enlarge a woman's vaginal opening. The procedure used to be routine to prevent the vagina from tearing, in the belief that this cut would help women heal easier than a spontaneous tear. But studies over the past 20 years have shown that the procedure does not offer the tissue any protection. CONS . Research shows women with a spontaneous tear actually recover in the same or less time than women who have had an episiotomy. Women who have had an episiotomy also tend to lose more blood during . the delivery and experience more pain during their recovery. The tear also has a greater chance of becoming larger and research shows it increases the risk of tearing in a second birth. It also increases the risk of infection. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other experts now agree that the procedure shouldn't be done routinely. PROS . But if a baby is very large or in an abnormal position and a doctor needs space for forceps, an episiotomy can be carried out. It can also help when the baby needs to be delivered as quickly as possible - if it is experiencing difficulties such as a drop in heart rate. Mothers-to-be are encouraged to speak with their practitioner to find out in what conditions he or she would perform an episiotomy. Midwives carry out the procedure much less than obstetricians.","Heather Nichols underwent an episiotomy - a small incision to enlarge the vaginal opening to help childbirth - when she had daughter Ruby Ann .

The woman, who calls herself 'Sharon B', posted the unusual ad on Tuesday with the title, 'Very unusual request'. Sharon B says she is seeking a woman for a man with whom she has been carrying on an affair for five years to take up with him when she dies. Very unusual: The ad placed by a married woman seeking a new partner for her lover after she dies . 'I was recently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. I do not have long to . live,' she writes.

'This relationship was outside my marriage, and it's a long story, so I'll save it for later communication,' she writes. Affair: The woman writes that she has been seeing the man for five years but that she is also married .

When it comes to flirting with girls, teenage boys seem to be taking their social cues from Carlos Danger. According to experts, new forms of communication like texting, Facebook and Twitter are becoming a crutch for teenage boys just starting to learn how to engage with the opposite sex. Many of these boys are using texting as a streamline to get what they want, often propositioning schoolmates for sex or other acts without so much as an 'I like you'. Cry for help? Teenage boys are using texts and tweets as a streamlined way to hook-up with girls, and it may be a sign they aren't learning traditional forms of communication . Harvard clinical psychologist Dr Catherine Steiner-Adair witnessed the problem while conducting research for her new book 'The Big Disconnect: Protecting Childhood and Family Relationships in the Digital Age.' Dr Steiner-Adair interviewed 1,000 students nationwide for her new book and found several instances where innately sexual messages were being accepted as the norm. While sitting in her English class, one 15-year-old girl got a text message from a boy in the same class who she hardly knew saying 'So, are you good at hooking up?' Kids these days: For her new book Catherine Steiner-Adair interviewed 1,000 American school students to learn how they communicate with each other in the digital era . 'Um idk. I don't really think about that,' she replied. 'Well I want my d*** in your mouth? Will you at least be my girlfriend,' he said. The girl was confused when he sent a note to her later saying he liked her. When interviewed by Dr Steiner-Adair, the girl asked whether or not she should explain to the boy how that initial conversation made her feel and then started to cry over whether it was even worth it. These messages obviously hurt girls, but Dr Steiner-Adair thinks there's something to be learned from how the boy misguided attempts at wooing. She says it's 'insufficient, superficial and polarizing' to cast the boys simply as aggressors. Their sexts may actually be a sign that they don't know how to express themselves - skipping to the last stages of courtship before they even know a girl. 'It's such a bad part of our culture to think that boys aren't also harmed,' she told Today. 'We are neglecting the emotional lives of boys.' When interviewing boys for her book, she observed that they didn't seem to understand the impact these messages were having on the girls they sent them to. One boy showed her a Facebook message his friends sent from his account to a girl reading: 'Your challenge is to go for weeks without d***s in all four of your holes.' The wrong message: Experts are afraid that current social cues are teaching young men that people are disposable . The boy wasn't mad that his friends sent the message behind his back. He thought it was funny: 'This is just my friends being idiots, basically. They were just trying to be funny. 'It didn't turn nasty. That's the norm for our generation,' he said. Social media expert Lola Ogunnaike says kids can't escape from the cues of our current hyper-sexualized culture. Pornography is readily available, as are images on TV, film and even in the real-life political scandals of Anthony Weiner. This has gotten boys confused on how to interact with girls their own age, simply mimicking what they see happening in popular culture. Dr Steiner-Adair believes these teenagers are 'yearning for intimacy that goes beyond biology' but just don't know how to make it happen. Parent intervention is necessary to correct this behavior because it has a costly social consequence later in life. 'What . it inevitably teaches young kids is that people in general are cheap, . disposable, and easily accessible and that's a problem because people . aren't fostering real relationships anymore,' Ogunnaike told Today. Child and teen specialist Dr Robyn Silverman agrees with Ogunnaike, saying parents should throw out the idea of the 'sex talk' in favor of a series of discussions. Dr Silverman says parents should keep track of their children's messages on their . phone and all social media accounts and explain what is and is not . appropriate. Her . litmus test: 'if your grandmother, your mother and your sister saw this . text or this tweet, would you be embarrassed?  If so, don't send it.'","Dr Catherine Steiner-Adair interviewed 1,000 U.S. students and found teenage boys using text messaging and social media in a sexual way .

The wrecking claw hangs over the Land Rover Defender as its operator prepares to crush the exclusive vehicle on the orders of US customs. Moments later the air is filled with the sound of twisted metal and shattering glass as the value of the car is reduced from a starting price of $100,000 to just $30 in seconds. The legendary Land Rover Defender - a favourite with the Royal Family - had failed strict US safety laws and was banned from the roads for failing to have an airbag. Scroll down for video . Doomed: The Land Rover Defender, which can go for upwards of $100,000, is about to be rendered worthless . All models less than 25 years old on the other side of the Atlantic are expected to have the safety feature. As a result, there is a lucrative market for the British-made vehicles, which can fetch up to six-times their UK value, and are often sold in the US for upwards of $100,000. This has created a lucrative black . market, with the importer of this model attempting to trick customs by . illegally altering the car's VIN and giving it a B registration number . plate. But their exploits . fell foul of Baltimore Port's eagle-eyed border officers, who seized the . car as an 'illegal and unsafe import'. Inspection: Customs officers declared the it unfit for the US roads after discovering it had been tampered with . Rough treatment: The bonnet of the banned car pops as it is picked up by a JCB . Power: The off-road vehicle may be able to go places other cars can't, but it is no match for the wrecking claw . Despite being known for its rugged build quality, the timeless Land Rover was no match for a scrapyard's powerful claw. A brief assault reduced the once immaculate 4x4 to a mangled wreck, with the remains dumped on the top of a pile of scrap metal. The US Customs and Border Protection . have now released photos of the British car being crushed in spectacular . fashion in a bid to warn off illegal importers. Robert Hunt, public affairs programme . manager for the CBP, said: 'The Land Rover Defender did not meet the . safety rules of the United states roads so therefore it had to be . destroyed. Gripping: The claw grips the exclusive vehicle, dramatically reducing its value from the £100,000 starting point . Crushed: The air is filled with breaking glass as the claw hammers down on the roof of the vehicle . Turnover: The dealer who attempted to import the vehicle is likely to have a serious dent in their profits . 'The importer manipulated the Defender to make it look over 25 years old so he could legally import it. He did not get away with it. 'It had to be seized and, because it had been illegally manipulated, we could not offer it for resale or re-export it and we had to ultimately destroy it. 'People think they're getting a 1975 Defender but really they're getting a 2005 Defender that's been illegally imported. 'They can get upwards of $100,000 for these cars. As scrap metal, it's probably worth about $30 now.' Worthless: The scrap metal worker dumps the battered vehicle upside down . Warning: US customs released the dramatic pictures to deter other importers from trying to con them . The Land Rover Defender, which has been around in various iterations since 1948, is a favourite for farmers, the armed forces and the Royal Family. The Queen is known to be a fan of the iconic car and has been filmed driving her's around the Balmoral estate. Land Rover imported about 7,000 Defenders from 1993 to 1997, but it had to discontinue because they failed requirements introduced in 1998.

An innovative new approach which uses pop-up rooms designed to be reminiscent of a bygone era is helping to reassure dementia patients. RemPods - which are set up like rooms from past decades - are used to help calm those in hospitals and care homes by taking them back to more familiar times. Designed in retro themes they are filled with authentic furniture and memorabilia which is hoped to get dementia sufferers talking about the memories they still retain. Scroll down for video . Richard Ernest (right) has now got the financial backing of two 'Dragons' including Deborah Meaden (left). The concept involves the creation of pop-up rooms reminiscent of a bygone era . The pioneering design includes a 1950s pop-up pod, pub, cinema, dance hall and vintage store, as well as many others with features from the 1960s. They have now become a fixture in more than 40 NHS Trusts, care homes, day centres and care charities since the company was founded in 2009. And in a further boost to the unique nostalgia product creator Richard Ernest, 35, has now got the backing of two judges from BBC2’s Dragons’ Den to roll the pods out worldwide. Mr Jones and Ms Meaden agreed to each give £50,000 to the project in exchange for a 22.5 per cent share. Richard described the process of going on the show as 'one of the scariest things I’ve ever done' and now intends to break into the U.S., Australia and New Zealand. The father-of-two, from Stroud, Gloucestershire, first came up with the idea of the pod after forming a close friendship with an elderly neighbour and his wife - who suffered with dementia. Here a 1950's cinema dementia pod is pictured. Mr Ernest, from Gloucestershire, came up with the idea of the pod after forming a close friendship with an elderly neighbour and his wife - who suffered with dementia . Over a period of several months Richard drove Sydney Swash, 98, to and from a care home to see his terminally ill wife. When she sadly passed away, the pair became close friends, going to the cinema together and to the local pub. Richard had also been going through a tough time after losing his job and splitting up with his girlfriend, so they became inseparable. The trips with Sydney, who is now in a care home himself, became the inspiration behind Richard’s innovative product, Reminiscence Pods, or RemPods for short. This pop-up room harks back to a 1950s living room, complete with retro TV, a wireless, classic wallpaper and a vintage table. Mr Ernest said such a room enables a care home or hospital to transform a clinical space into a therapeutic and calming environment . He realised the importance of familiarity for sufferers and the need for more stimulating surroundings for those living with the degenerative illness. Richard decided that creating a cost-effective pop-up reminiscence room would enable a care home or hospital to transform a clinical space into a therapeutic and calming environment that would reduce the anxiety in people with dementia. 'I’d never been in a care home before, I’d never witnessed dementia, never heard of it before, and everything just stemmed from that,' said Mr Ernest. 'I used to wait in reception and have a cup of tea and had people come up to me thinking I was their son or husband. Here a mock-up of an old-fashioned pub helps to jog a patient's memory and reminds them of when they were younger and less ill. The rooms have become a fixture in more than 40 NHS trusts, care homes, day centres and care charities since the company was founded in 2009 . 'They were back in the Fifties and Sixties, in a different world and I got into dementia research from there. Sydney was always talking about the Fifties and the war too.' He soon created a handful of themed rooms with era-specific furniture, including a television and radio from the era, standard lamp and rug with the intention of being a homely space. There are also music, films and newspaper articles from the time. Richard appeared on Dragons’ Den on Sunday where he was quizzed by Deborah and Peter before they offered the substantial investment. The trio have also agreed to donate some of the company’s profits to charity. 'I always wanted to give something back,' said Richard. 'It’s a commercial business but if it made a lot of money we all came to an agreement that we would give a percentage of the profits back to a charity such as The Alzheimer’s Society.' The entrepreneur added that he cannot believe how much his life has turned around since meeting Sydney, who he still tries to visit as often as he can. He said: 'I was volunteering and working in care. It was a struggle and we didn’t have a lot of money. It seems crazy but we were having our first baby and I thought ‘how are we going to survive?’ 'I had a dream and this dream told me everything about what it was I was going to do and RemPods. I’ve never had anything like that before, and am not really religious, but I just had to do it. 'I got a credit card, which was a big risk and put £3,000 into the business and have never looked back.'","RemPods are designed to look like rooms from a bygone era - pop-up scenarios include a pub, a cinema and a typical 50s living room .

But minutes after the meal got  under way, he began choking on a piece of lamb and was taken outside. Tragic: What was meant to be the happiest day of their lives turned to tragedy when Jagan Babwah, right, choked to death at the wedding of his daughter Camela, left . Guests tried to perform the Heimlich manoeuvre to clear the blockage but the father of four suffered a heart attack. He was pronounced dead when paramedics arrived at the scene. Camela Taylor, 35, decided to . continue the celebration, as her father would have been angry if they . had stopped because of his death.

He looked so smart.’ Mr Babwah, also from Gillingham, had . been sitting next to his wife Shanty, 67, at the reception in  Cooling . Castle, Rochester, Kent, on May 31. He was escorted outside for fresh . air as he started to choke. Mrs Taylor waited for her father to . return but she was taken to the adjoining room – where her wedding . service had taken place earlier   – to be told that he was dead. She never got to hear his speech and . revealed how she struggled to read his card message the following day. ‘To be honest opening the card was the hardest part,’ she said. ‘I . opened it the next day.

A terrified teenage couple were confronted by armed police on their first holiday abroad - over a row about dirty hand towels. Francesca Stefanyszyn, 17, and her boyfriend Ged Sykes, 18, were checking out of their five-star hotel in Krakow, Poland, when staff demanded £41 to pay for the towels, which were lightly marked with mud. The young couple, who were on holiday earlier this month for Ged’s 18th birthday, said the situation escalated when they had no money to pay for them and staff called two 'burly' armed police officers who demanded their passports. Scroll down for video . Francesca Stefanyszyn, 17, and Ged Sykes, 18, were confronted by armed police on their first holiday abroad - over a row about dirty hand towels . Francesca, an A-level student, said: 'I was absolutely petrified. Our flight was two hours away and I thought I was going to be arrested or shot. 'We had used the towels to lie on when we visited a park and they were very lightly marked with soil. 'We had handed them in four days before we were leaving so the hotel could clean them but staff waited until we were getting picked up to be taken to the airport before they raised an issue. 'They told us they were stained but you could see they hadn’t even tried to wash them. 'We had no money left and couldn’t pay so they called the police. The teenage couple had used the towels to lie on during a visit to a park while on their holiday in Krakow . 'Two big officers arrived straight away carrying guns and blocked the exit so we were trapped in the hotel. 'They didn’t speak any English so we couldn’t explain our side of things and they just kept demanding our passports. 'They took them from us and then our taxi to the airport couldn’t wait for us anymore and drove off. The couple were terrified when hotel staff called the police and demanded they hand over their passports. Miss Stefanyszyn feared they would miss their flight home and be arrested . 'I was crying my eyes out. I thought we were going to be arrested or stranded in Poland. 'I’d never been on holiday without my parents before and I just didn’t know what to do.' Francesca phoned her father Taras, 49, who paid the 200 Zloty over the phone with his credit card. Mr Stefanyszyn had booked the trip for the pair, paying for flights, a five-night stay at the Crown Piast Hotel and transfers, as a present for Ged’s birthday. He said: 'It was early in the morning and I got a very distressed phone call from Fran. 'She had never been away on her own before and she was in tears. 'She felt very threatened by the two burly police officers who had turned up armed with guns and truncheons. 'I asked to speak to the manager but they were really aggressive with me on the phone and said he wasn’t around. 'If I hadn’t been able to pay over the phone they would probably have been arrested. 'There were no niceties and they were bang out of order. 'Fran and Ged brought the towels home with them for us to see and they weren’t even stained. 'They just had a few marks on them so I couldn’t believe how they had reacted. The couple were staying in the five star Crown Piast Hotel in Krakow, as part of a birthday gift to Mr Sykes from his girlfriend's father, Taras Stefanyszyn . 'They hadn’t even attempted to clean them. 'I think they saw two kids and thought they could get more money from them. 'It’s such a shame because I suggested Krakow when they were deciding where to go. I love the place and thought it would be a really safe place for them to go.' The couple only just managed to catch their flight home thanks to the intervention of Francesca’s father and washed the towels when they arrived home. It was the couple's first holiday alone together to celebrate Mr Sykes's 18th birthday . Francesca, who is of Ukrainian and Russian descent, said: 'All of the marks came out with just one wash. 'The whole thing was a horrible experience and it means I will be really cautious when I next go on holiday. 'I didn’t know how to deal with what happened and now I’m wary at the thought of travelling anywhere. 'I couldn’t stop crying and I dread to think about what would have happened if my dad hadn’t answered his phone.' Taras says he has contacted the hotel since the incident to complain but they have refused to apologise. A spokesman for the hotel said the matter was very important to them and that they would investigate it before responding properly.","Francesca Stefanyszyn, and Ged Sykes had no money to pay for damage .

Senior figures at Oxford University have warned that the prestigious institution could undermine its own reputation by relaxing admission standards for foreign students. Students from the U.S. and elsewhere are paying as much as £40,000 a year to study at Oxford for up to a year. But they do not have to show the same level of academic ability as most undergraduates - and an internal report has voiced fears that the admissions are threatening the university. Prestigious: But Oxford is threatened by lower-quality students from overseas, according to a report . Concerns centre around 'associate students', who are typically undergraduates at American universities who spend between a term and a year studying at Oxford. They do not officially become members of the university, but are admitted to one of the 38 colleges, which have complete control over their own admission policies. An internal report revealed by the Daily Telegraph warned that associate students 'pose severe reputational risk' to the university, arguing that their standards are 'often low' and claiming they are usually accepted on 'purely commercial' grounds. Most such students do not apply directly to the college, but are accepted via a commercial company which takes a cut of their fees. The largest such company is apparently the Washington International Studies Council, which charges $20,900 (£13,400) per term. The firm places students with a number of colleges, including historic institutions such as Magdalen, Christ Church and New College, which receive around £4,000 per student per term. Danger: Officials are concerned that Oxford colleges are charging high fees to under-qualified students . On its website, WISC says that its students cannot get an Oxford degree, but insists they enjoy the same level of teaching as normal undergraduates. It also states that 'admission is always entirely the responsibility of the Oxford college' - but according to the university's internal report, they do not have to undergo rigorous checks of their academic qualifications. 'Although there is some assessment of their GPA [Grade Point Average] scores before they are admitted by each college, the transaction seems to be one of a purely commercial kind,' the report said. The document expressed concern that employers and members of the public would not understand the difference between a full Oxford degree and a year spent studying at the university. However, it admitted that the university had benefited from millions of pounds in fees paid by associate students for access to the Bodleian Library. A spokesman for the university said: 'Associate members (formerly known as ""associate students"") pay a fee to use college facilities for a term. This is a way for colleges to make their facilities more widely available while earning income. 'Associate members are not Oxford University students and do not take up student places. They do not receive teaching and do not gain an Oxford qualification. All this is made clear upfront.' Alumni: David Cameron and Ed Miliband are among the many public figures to have studied at Oxford . Oxford, whose alumni include hundreds of . public figures such as David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Stephen Hawking and . Philip Pullman, has long had a tradition of attracting students from . overseas. The elite Rhodes Scholarships are . considered one of the most prestigious academic awards in the world, . with past scholars including Bill Clinton and U.S. National Security . Adviser Susan Rice. In addition, the university admits hundreds of fully-fledged foreign undergraduates, and insists that they are held to the same standards as British students. UK universities have come under fire in recent weeks for allegedly treating overseas students as 'cash cows', charging them up to £35,000 a year compared to a maximum of £9,000 for British undergraduates. Oxford and Cambridge are believed to have turned down more than 25,000 British applicants this year, nearly all of whom were predicted to get at least three A grades in their A-levels. Alastair Herron, from Northern Ireland, achieved seven A*s earlier this month, but was rejected by Oxford and is now heading to Stanford University in California.

"By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 05:22 EST, 27 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:32 EST, 27 August 2013 . A pensioner with cancer has been told he faces a £25,000-a-year bill for treatment because he lives in Wales. Retired miner Jimmy Chesters, 76, from Wrexham, has spoken out after discovering the price tag for the drug which could prolong his life. Mr Chesters, who is being treated by doctors in an English hospital, says if he was living in England he could receive the drug Sorefenib, but that he is the victim of a ‘postcode lottery’. Jimmy Chesters, 76, has bowel cancer and needs the drug Sorefenib to prolong his life. If he lived in England he would receive it free. As he lives in Wales he would have to pay £25,000 a year to access it . Yesterday it was revealed some Welsh patients are being forced to move to England to get life-prolonging cancer drugs. English patients are four times more likely to get newer cancer drugs than those living in Wales because of special government funding which allows doctors to give drugs not yet given the go-ahead on the NHS. Government figures show 15,456 patients in England were given money last year by the Cancer Drugs Fund – which pays for treatments that have not yet been approved by NICE, the NHS rationing body. This works out at 29 people per 100,000. The Labour-run Welsh Assembly, whose decision to provide free prescriptions left its budget squeezed, has so far refused to implement a similar scheme. This means just 216 patients in Wales were given money for new cancer drugs by applying for exceptional NHS funding – or seven per 100,000 people. Mr Chesters, who is being treated by doctors in an English hospital in Birmingham, says that he is the victim of a 'postcode lottery' Ministers launched the £650million Cancer Drugs Fund three years ago. Doctors apply on behalf of their patients to get any drug they believe will extend or enhance their lives. But the fund was a temporary measure and is due to be wound-up in April. The Government is getting ready to introduce a system of Value-Based Pricing next year, which is expected to give the green-light to more expensive cancer drugs. Mr Chesters said he was shocked when a doctor at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham told him his drugs would cost £25,000 per year. ‘No working class person could possibly afford that,’ said Mr Chesters. ‘It was certainly a shock to find out it would cost that much. ‘It’s an awful lot of money, impossible to afford.’ Mr Chesters said the potential cost for the Sorafenib drug, also known as Nexavar, could apply each year for the remainder of his life. Since April 2013 the national Cancer Drugs Fund has approved the use of Sorafenib. But funding only applies to patients living in England. ‘If I was living in England, I’d be able to get this treatment,’ he said. ‘I need this sorting.’ Originally diagnosed with cancerous tumours on the liver several years ago, Mr Chesters now needs treatment as cancer has returned in the muscle of his bowel. He has been given some help towards covering the cost of the drugs thanks to fundraising taking place in his local community. ‘It has been brilliant that people have done this for me,’ added Mr Chesters. ‘I never realised I was so popular. Everyone has been doing so much for me. I’m very grateful.’ Although living in Wales, Mr Chesters is seen by medics in Birmingham. A spokesman for University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust said they did not wish to add to a statement issued last month. Mr Chesters said he was shocked when a doctor at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham told him his drugs would cost £25,000 per year. He said: 'No working class person could possibly afford that' It read: ‘We are unable to comment on individual cases. The Trust does adhere to the national guidelines regarding prescribing. ‘Since April 2013, the national Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) has approved the use of Sorafenib (Nexavar). ‘However, the CDF only applies to those patients living in England and not Wales.’ Patients can apply to an all-Wales panel which will consider if there are grounds for funding a particular medicine or treatment based on their medical history.","Jimmy Chesters has bowel cancer and needs Sorefenib to prolong his life .

She is now underweight and only weighs 5st 7lbs . A woman who underwent gastric bypass surgery has so lost so much weight she fears she might starve to death. Tracey McLaughlin, 51, underwent gastric bypass surgery in December 2010, weighing 19st. She is only 4ft 10ins and was so overweight that she was confined to a wheelchair with crippling arthritis. She had the surgery after being told that her health was in danger, Closer reports. The mother-of-two lost 10st within a year of having the operation and was then happy with her weight. However, she has continued to lose weight rapidly and has shrunk to just 5st 7lbs and has a BMI of 16 – the healthy range is 18.5 to 25. Ms McLaughlin, from Manchester, is now so weak that she is mainly bedridden and she has been told that if she continues to lose weight she could die. She has to wear clothes meant for 10 to 11-year-old children. She told Closer: ‘Having a gastric bypass was the biggest mistake I’ve ever made. Although I had health problems, I was happy being big. ‘Now I spend my days in bed watching TV and can’t go to the shops alone.’ Doctors are still trying to establish why Ms McLaughlin is losing so much weight. They believe that scar tissue in her stomach could be affecting the cells that absorb food. Ms . McLaughlin explained that she tries to eat fattening foods such as . bacon sandwiches, Chinese takeaways and biscuits but that this is not . resolving the problem. She says that she cannot bear looking in the mirror because her ribs are protruding and her eyes are sunken. She told Closer: ‘My body is emaciated. I’m terrified I could starve to death.’ Ms McLaughlin says she was happier before she had the surgery and that it was the biggest mistake she has ever made. She has been warned that if she loses any more weight she may need to be put on a drip . Ms McLaughlin, whose children Liam and Louise are in their 20s, started to pile on the pounds when she was in her 30s. To read Ms McLaughlin's full story, see this week's Closer magazine which is out now . She says that she would eat two pies . and two cakes in the morning, cheese on toast for lunch, a sausage roll, . fish and chips for supper, and then snack on biscuits. Despite her weight, she was happy and was proud of her larger figure. However, she began to experience problems when she was in her 40s and was a size 26. Her . joints were being put under so much pressure by her weight that she . developed crippling arthritis and was told she would be in a wheelchair . for the rest of her life unless she lost weight. When diets failed to shift the excess pounds, she was offered gastric bypass surgery. She says that after the surgery she dropped quickly to a size 10 and felt healthy so decided she did not want to lose any more weight. However, she continued to lose weight despite eating as much as she could. She has undergone a CT scan which failed to reveal what the problem is. She will now have more tests to help doctors establish why she has become so thin. Ms McLaughlin has been told that if she keeps losing weight she may soon have to be placed on a drip to ensure that she gets enough nutrients. To read the full story, see this week's Closer magazine which is out now. A gastric bypass is a last resort for people carrying a dangerous amount of weight. It is available on the NHS for people who have a BMI of more than 40, or for those with a BMI of more than 35 who also have a serious weight-related health condition. During the operation the digestive system is re-routed past most of the patient's stomach so that they digest less food and feel full quicker. The patient is left with just a small pouch in place of their stomach. After the surgery, people tend to lose weight very quickly - most people who have had this procedure lose two thirds of their excess body weight. Patients have to stick to a strict diet and exercise plan after the operation. Many people find that they are left with lose folds of skin after they lose weight - this can require further surgery to correct. Gastric bypass surgery comes with many potentially fatal risks, including internal bleeding and blood clots. One in 100 gastric bypass surgery patients die shortly after surgery. The surgery cannot be reversed. Source: NHS Choices .","Tracey McLaughlin had surgery after her weight caused crippling arthritis .

A grandmother has told how she had to beg doctors to remove a surgical clip which had migrated across her body from her groin to her chest. Cheryl Osborne, 51, had the metal device fitted to her fallopian tubes when she was sterilised 12 years ago. However, three years ago she started suffering back, stomach and chest pain and an X-ray revealed a foreign body on the right side of her chest. Cheryl Osborne had clips fitted to her fallopian tubes when she was sterilised in 2001. In 2010 she started to suffer pain in her back, stomach and chest which she thinks was caused by one of the clips moving around . But Mrs Osborne claims she was left in agony for a further four months until she finally convinced doctors to carry out keyhole surgery to remove the clip. She believes it could have been travelling around her body since she first noticed the pain as she remembers a medic spotting it on a scan in 2010. Mrs Osborne has now urged other sterilised women to demand answers if they are in pain. She said: ‘I was in complete agony. I love walking and playing with my grandchildren but I was having to cancel visits as I felt so unwell. ‘I could not lie on my back or right side as I was in so much pain. ‘My friends and work colleagues said I looked grey, but despite clearly being in agony, the doctors kept refusing to get the clip out of my body. An X-ray eventually showed that one of the clips had become lodged near Mrs Osborne's liver. The X-ray shows one of the clips still in place on her fallopian tube and the other stuck under her rib cage . ‘I was so shocked and scared when I saw the clip on my rib. ‘I . believe it was on the move for three years - I can’t bear to think what . damage it could have done to my body. I am lucky to be alive. ‘I kept telling the doctors “there is a piece of metal in me, get it out”, but they reacted like it wasn’t a big problem.’ Mrs Osborne, from Hastings, East Sussex, was sterilised at Conquest Hospital in St Leonards-on-Sea in 2001. When she started to suffer from pain three years ago she was diagnosed with angina and became reliant on taking the maximum daily dose of strong painkiller Co-codamol. But when the pain got too much in December last year she went to her GP and was told her liver function was unusually high and needed monitoring. A stomach X-ray taken at Conquest Hospital on January 18 this year showed the clip nestled under her liver. Despite this she was sent home but returned to A&E a few days later on January 23 and was given an ultrasound which failed to spot the clip, so she was sent home again. She went back to A&E on February 18 still in pain but was again told to go home - despite the doctor acknowledging that the clip was in the wrong place. Eventually, on March 25, Mrs Osborne got an appointment at the hospital with a registrar who booked her in for an emergency CT scan - which she had two weeks later on April 9. Mrs Osborne says that even after the stray clip had been located, she had to beg surgeons to remove it as they thought it was 'harmless' An emergency MRI scan on April 21 confirmed where the clip was and it was finally removed on May 13. Mrs Osborne says she has suffered no pain since. She says that she also no longer has any signs of angina - in fact, she believes she never had it, and that the clip was causing the pain. Since the operation, Mrs Osborne's liver function has also been improving steadily and so she believes the abnormality was caused by the clip pressing on it. However, she acknowledges that the painkillers she was taking might have contributed to the problem. She said: ‘I know the NHS is pushed for funding and they are short-staffed but the care I received was appalling. ‘Had I known the risks of the clip migrating across my body I would never have asked to be sterilised. ‘Women need to know the risks and think twice about this operation.’ A spokesman for East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust defended Mrs Osborne’s treatment and said the clip was ‘harmless’. ‘On each attendance at Accident and Emergency Mrs Osborne was treated appropriately,’ he said. ‘As she was not acutely ill she was, on each occasion, referred back to her GP. She was referred to a surgeon and tests were undertaken (not as an emergency) to fully investigate her symptoms. ‘It is the opinion of the surgeon treating her that the clip was not causing the symptoms she was describing. ‘There was no clinical need for the procedure to remove the clip however it was decided to undertake the procedure because of Mrs Osborne’s severe anxiety. ‘The last time this lady was seen in clinic she informed the surgeon that she was very happy. ‘These clips commonly migrate and are harmless. ‘It is not unusual this long after the original sterilisation procedure as the fallopian tubes to wither and deteriorate once they are divided and the clip has no tissue left to “hold” onto.’","Cheryl Osborne was sterilised at Conquest Hospital, East Sussex, in 2001 .

A Las Vegas billionaire is said to have given $5 million to an independent group backing Newt Gingrich, breathing new life into the former House Speaker's struggling presidential campaign. Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who owns the famed Venetian Hotel and is the eighth richest man in America, is a long-timer backer of Mr Gingrich and his low-tax policies but his reported donation to the political action committee Winning Our Future has focused fresh attention on the independent groups. Known as 'super PACs,' they can take in unlimited donation and unleash a barrage of negative advertising against opposing candidates. That was how frontrunner Mitt Romney's Restore Our Future PAC helped snuff out a late challenge by Mr Gingrich in Iowa. New lease on life: Newt Gingrich (left) allegedly got a major boost with the $5 million donation to his super PAC from casino mogul Sheldon Adelson (right). Mr Adelson is worth an estimated $21.5 billion. Mogul: Mr Adelson, the eighth richest man in America, owns the iconic Venetian Resort Hotel Casino in Las Vegas . A source told the Associated Press Mr . Adelson is expected to contribute as much or more to groups backing the . Republican nominee, be it Gingrich or one of his rivals. Rick Tyler, a former top Gingrich strategist and spokesman for Winning Our Future, declined to comment on the donation, which was first reported by The Washington Post. Politico reported last month that Mr Adelson was allegedly prepared to spend $20 million to help Mr Gingrich. Meanwhile, Mr Gingrich received a Palin endorsement Monday. Todd Palin told ABC News he respects the former House Speaker for his ability to mount a comeback last month after staffers quit his campaign en mass in the spring. He said his wife Sarah, the former Republican vice presidential nominee, has not picked a candidate yet. A 2010 Supreme Court decision easing restrictions on corporate and individual spending laid the groundwork for these political action committees, or super PACs, which can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections as long as they do not coordinate directly with a candidate's campaign. The identities of those who contributed to super PACs in the second half of 2011 won't be reported until the end of January. Luxury: Mr Adelson has made the bulk of his fortune building and running luxury casinos like the Venetian Hotel . International holdings: In addition to his hotels in US, Mr Sheldon's company owns several properties in Macao, China, including the Sands Hotel Macao . Many donors' names will never be known. Some super PACs have established nonprofit arms that are permitted to shield contributors' identities as long as they spend no more than 50 percent of their money on electoral politics. Crossroads, the giant conservative outfit tied to former George W. Bush political adviser Karl Rove, operates both a super PAC and a nonprofit. Sheldon Adelson is a Las Vegas billionaire who has long been a supporter of Republican causes. He founded and owns the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino and the Sands Expo and Convention Center. Much of his wealth comes from the public offering of Las Vegas Sands Corp, the parent company that owns both businesses and other casinos in Macau and Singapore. With an estimated net worth of $21.5 billion, Mr Adelson, 78, is the eighth richest man in America and the 16th richest in the world. Mr Adelson was initially a Democrat but became a Republican later in life. He was quoted in the New Yorker magazine as saying, 'Why is it fair that I should be paying a higher percentage of taxes than anyone else?' In 2010, he gave $1 million to Newt Gingrich's super PAC, American Solutions for Winning the Future. A Jewish American, Mr Adelson has strong ties to Israel and owns Israel HaYom (Israel Today), the country's largest newspaper. The Haaretz newspaper reports that he is a close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Crossroads and other Republican-leaning super PACs played a significant role in the 2010 midterm elections, helping deliver the House to the GOP and boost the number of Republicans in the Senate. The 2012 contest is the first to test the influence of such groups in presidential politics. No candidate has seen his fortunes affected by the emergence of super PACs more than Mr Gingrich. Riding high in polls just a month ago, he became the target of a $3 million advertising barrage sponsored by Restore Our Future, a super PAC supporting Mitt Romney run by several of the former Massachusetts governor's allies. The ads, which pounded Mr Gingrich for his ties to federal housing giant Freddie Mac and his reversal on issues like climate change, sent his political fortunes plunging in Iowa. Mr Gingrich finished fourth in the state's caucuses last week. Mr Gingrich has vowed to carry on and . is hoping to resuscitate his campaign in South Carolina, which holds its . primary January 21. Since Romney is heavily favored to win the New . Hampshire primary Tuesday, his rivals are looking to slow his momentum . when the contest moves south. Several . super PACs have already played a role in the Republican campaign. They . include Make Us Great Again, a super PAC backing Texas Gov Rick Perry; . Our Destiny, supporting former Utah Gov Jon Huntsman; and the Red White . and Blue Fund, which helped revive Rick Santorum's campaign in Iowa and . is running ads in South Carolina. Priorities USA Action, a super PAC backing President Barack Obama's re-election campaign, has spent modestly during the Republican nominating contest and is expected to step up its role in the general election. Newt Gingrich was once the front-runner in the race for the Republican presidential nomination. But, after a $3 million negative ad barrage in Iowa and media focus on his past and its baggage, he has fallen to third place. In last week's caucuses, he captured just 13.3 percent of the vote and came in fourth.

They released a statement via their publicist after reports their marriage had hit the rocks. 'Catherine and Michael are taking some time apart to evaluate and work on their marriage. There will be no further comment,' a representative told MailOnline on behalf of the pair. Their marriage has been dealt numerous stresses in the last three years with Michael being diagnosed with throat cancer in 2010 - which he beat - and Catherine, 43, suffering from bouts of bipolar II disorder, most recently in May this year. The Hollywood power couple are currently thousands of miles apart, with Michael holidaying in Europe while Catherine remains in New York.

Time apart: Michael Douglas and his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones, last pictured together here on 22 April, have . reportedly separated as they struggle to maintain their marriage . Neither are making moves towards a divorce or legal separation at this stage, according to this week's People magazine. 'Separated': This week's People magazine claims they are taking a break from one another . The couple, who married in 2000, haven't been seen publicly together since 22 April, when they cuddled up on the red carpet at the 40th Annual Chaplin Award Gala at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City. They are said to have decided to spend some time alone after Michael returned from this year's Cannes Film Festival in France in May. While in Italy last week, Michael was seen playing golf on his own - a hobby he once enjoyed with second wife Catherine. Michael is said to be living in . Manhattan while Catherine is staying at their $4m home in New York State . with their children Dylan, 13, and Carys, ten. Rumours about the couple's marriage trouble have been circulating for months. In February it was claimed by The . Enquirer that the pair were to separate in a 'hush hush' divorce. (They . denied the claims at the time.) The . Enquirer alleged that the marriage 'buckled under the pressure of . dealing with Michael's cancer battle, his son Cameron's incarceration on . drugs charges and Catherine's struggle with bipolar II disorder.' More recently, Star . Magazine reported that Catherine was set to begin a '$300m divorce battle' against Michael.

Were you surprised to hear of Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' split? Sources told People magazine this week that the strain of the past few years took its toll on the couple. 'It's been very stressful,' said a family friend. 'He loved Catherine, but she has her own issues.' And Catherine was apparently distraught during her husband's cancer battle, telling the Daily Telegraph that she hadn't 'had to deal with anything like that before, ever. I wasn't as strong as I thought I could have been.' But in an interview last month with the . Daily Mirror, Michael hinted that the couple's struggles had only served . to strengthen their bond.

Solo appearance: Catherine, seen here minus Michael at the Los Angeles premiere of her film Red 2 in July . 'True love takes work. Love is an extraordinary feeling that comes from . the bottom of your soul, but has to be nurtured, you know. The thing . I've learned about getting older is you can't take love for granted,' he . said. 'You protect it, nurture it and it grows and after one's initial, . physical, emotional aspects, it becomes deeper,' added Michael. On Friday, Michael is expected to attend the Deauville Film Festival in France; poignantly, it is where he first met Catherine in 1998 and famously introduced himself by saying: 'I want to father your children.' Michael, the son of screen veteran Kirk Douglas, was attracted to Catherine after seeing her in the 1998 film The Mask Of Zorro. 'It was like when I saw Julie Christie. Wow,' he told People in 2009. 'We romanced each other slowly - controlled by Catherine.' And the feeling was mutual, said Catherine. 'I fell in love with Michael the . moment I met him and our relationship has just grown stronger and . stronger,' Catherine told the UK edition of OK! magazine in 2010. 'We . are very close. I know there were some cynics when we first got together . but we married because of love and that has never waned, not for a . minute,' she added. They were to . marry two years later in a lavish ceremony at the Plaza Hotel in . Manhattan, which was attended by the likes of Jack Nicholson and Martha . Stewart. Catherine was . first treated for bipolar II disorder in 2011. And in . April, she underwent another stint in rehab in her continued effort to . manage the illness. Michael, meanwhile, revealed he was suffering from stage IV throat cancer in August 2010. He underwent treatment and in January the following year publicly declared the tumour had gone. Family portrait: Cather and Michael in February 2011 at Buckingham Palace in London with their two children Dylan and Carys . At the time, he attributed the illness to stress, his previous alcohol abuse and years of heavy smoking. But in June this year he made comments saying the HPV virus - which is contracted through oral sex - could have been the cause of his cancer. Douglas backtracked on his remarks, but . Catherine was humiliated because he didn't clarify he was exposed to the . virus before meeting her, according to People magazine. Bad move: Michael said in June that the HPV virus could have been the cause of his cancer, a comment that apparently 'humiliated' Catherine, pictured on the Graham Norton Show in May . Michael recently spoke about his divorce from first wife Diandra, a 23-year marriage he admits he should have ended earlier. He said: 'I know I’m going to get into trouble here. I have nothing against her and in fact I’m very fond of my first wife. But we should have ended that marriage eight or 10 years earlier. 'It took me too long to realise that if you go to a marriage counselor to resolve problems, it’s in his interest to keep the marriage going. Because if I end the marriage he’s got no business.' Diandra won a reported $45 million in the divorce settlement, and in 2011, she unsuccessfully tried to sue Michael for half of his earnings from the movie Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. Hung on too long: Michael  admitted in a recent interview that he and ex-wife Diandra Luker should have divorced far sooner than what they did, in 2000, pictured together in NYC in 1990 .

A zookeeper literally has to p-p-p-ick up a penguin every night because she cannot sleep until she has had a cuddle. Webster was separated from her natural parents when she was just three days old after they rejected her, and was instead taken under the wing of John Pickering and his family. Having been nursed by Mr Pickering night and day for three months, the cute Humboldt penguin now thinks he is her surrogate father, and refuses to go to sleep until he has given her a loving hug. Birds of a feather: Webster, an 11-year-old Humboldt penguin, will not go to sleep without a goodnight cuddle from her surrogate father, John Pickering . Chin up: Webster went to live with Mr Pickering and his family when she was rejected by her parents in 2002 . Mr Pickering, who has worked at Sewerby Hall Zoo in East Yorkshire for 34 years, said: 'It’s possible she thinks she’s a human, since . she grew up in our family home. She looks at me like a surrogate dad, so . we have a really close bond. 'Every evening she likes to follow me round, watching me put all the other penguins to bed. It’s like she’s helping me. 'Then, . when it comes to her bedtime, she won’t go to bed without a hug, so I . have to put my arm around her and give her a little scratch on her . head.' Webster - named by Mr Pickering's two . sons James and Thomas due to her webbed feet - had to be fed four times a . day at regular intervals for the first three months of her life, starting at 6.30am and not finishing until midnight. She was born in 2002 to parents Rosie and Dion, but was rejected by them because they already had another chick. To ensure she survived, the Pickerings had to mimic the penguin's feeding technique to make sure Webster, now 11, ate properly. Natural pose: Webster poses from the camera at Sewerbury Zoo in East Yorkshire . Mr Pickering said: 'We started off with blended up fish, salt water and a vitamin supplement in a syringe. 'It . takes two people to feed (a penguin) so it’s quite difficult. I had to pick up my . wife from work and we’d both go back at lunchtime and feed her - it was a . lot of running around. 'After . about a month she could eat small fish, so it was a lot easier. My . sons, who at that time were about 17 and 15, named her Webster because . of her webbed feet. 'They . didn’t know she was a girl at the time because you can’t tell until . they’re a bit older. Females have a flatter head and males are more . rounded. 'She was really . part of the family. At the time we had a Norfolk terrier who Webster got . on well with. She answers to her own name when you call her.' While . the family of four enjoyed having Webster living with them at their home in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, they knew . that she would have to be reintegrated with the other penguins in the . longer term. Mr Pickering said: 'She was fine with . the other penguins. Obviously there is a pecking order and they assume . rank but she’s never had any problems.' And while she has been successfully integrated with the rest of the flock, she insists . on 'helping' John at work, following him on his rounds every evening to . put the other birds to bed.

Singer and actress Courtney Love unwittingly employed a convicted blagger to obtain her British bank statements as she could no longer remember her account details, it was claimed last night. Miss Love, 49, is believed to have opened up to ten Barclays accounts in the UK between 2006-2008, but lost her account numbers and sort codes and even forgot the name of the bank. However, she became convinced that she had deposited millions of pounds into the accounts which she could no longer access, said a well-placed source. Miss Love, 49, is believed to have opened up to ten Barclays accounts in the UK between 2006-2008, but lost her account numbers and sort codes and even forgot the name of the bank . Miss Love, the widow of the late Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, approached a private security company called Greymans to see if it could help. Greymans, which was closed down in 2011, was well known to  celebrities and high net-worth individuals as it provided bespoke private security and bodyguard protection. It also used to conduct investigations for its  wealthy clients. Confidential emails seen by The Mail on Sunday show that investigators at Greymans turned to a convicted private detective called Adam John Spears to obtain Miss Love’s bank records. She became convinced that she had deposited millions of pounds into the accounts which she could no longer access, said a well-placed source . Spears, 73, a former Met detective, then used a blagger called Daniel Summers, 34, to trace her supposedly  missing millions. Spears and Summers were among the five suspects arrested in 2009 as part of Operation Millipede for blagging and unlawfully obtaining bank statements, mobile phone bills and even medical and police records of victims. Both Spears and Summers pleaded guilty and were sentenced at Kingston Crown Court last year. Spears, 73, a former Met detective, then used a blagger called Daniel Summers, 34, to trace her supposedly missing millions . The Mail on Sunday has seen emails from June 2008 in which Spears discusses Miss Love’s case with the then financial controller of Greymans, Andy Driver. In the emails, Miss Love is referred to by the code-name ‘Eustace’. One sent by Mr Driver to Summers is headed ‘Miss Love/Eustace’. In an email received by Mr Driver, Spears says of Miss Love: ‘If I have it right, this is the “famous” client who seems to have mislaid her funds?’ Spears then tells Driver that he will get Summers to do a general ‘trawl’ of UK bank accounts to locate her money. It is believed that Summers telephoned British banks pretending to be Miss Love, disguising his voice through a text-to-voice device designed for use by deaf people. A source close to the SOCA investigation said that Summers found up to ten Barclays accounts belonging to Miss Love – but there were no millions.   ‘He just found a few pence and a few pounds in each,’ said  the source. The singer spent weeks at a time in London during 2007 as she performed a number of gigs in the capital. It is believed she opened several bank accounts as she would withdraw thousands of pounds at a time during her stay in London. The Mail on Sunday made repeated attempts to contact agents for Miss Love  by phone and email but received  no reply.","She is believed to have opened up to ten Barclays accounts in the UK .

A 57-year-old Manhattan housewife has been arrested for allegedly offering an undercover officer posing as a hit man $60,000 worth of German stamps as payment for killing her unemployed husband in a dispute over money. Elena Sava Adams was arrested in Brooklyn Thursday during a meeting with a man she thought to be an assassin to discuss the hit, which was supposed to take place Sunday. According to investigators, Mrs Adams wanted to have her spouse, 66-year-old Irving Adams, run over by a car because she believed that he had been hiding a substantial sum of money from her after losing his job as chief compliance officer at Israel Discount Bank of New York. Scroll down for video . Collared: Elena Sava Adams, 57 (center), was arrested after police say she met with an undercover officer posing as a hit man to arrange the killing of her husband . Motive: Mrs Adams allegedly suspected her unemployed banker husband of hiding money from her and wanted to collect his insurance policy after his death . Police say that Mrs Adams initially shared her plan to have her husband eliminated with a friend, who in turn went to the authorities, CBS New York reported. As part of Elena Adams' alleged plot, she and her husband, who live in lower Manhattan, were supposed to have lunch at a restaurant Sunday near Avenue Z and East 11th Street in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn. Police say that if her plan had worked, Mr Adams would have been struck and killed by a vehicle driven by the assassin while crossing the street with his wife, who then would have been able to collect his accidental death insurance policy. On Thursday, Elena Sava Adams, a Romanian national, arrived in Sheepshead Bay to meet up with the undercover investigator from the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office posing as a hit man. Planned accident: As part of the alleged murder plot, Irving Adams was supposed to be struck and killed by a car driven by the hit man while crossing the street near Avenue Z and East 11st Street in Brooklyn . Payment: Elena Adams allegedly offered the bogus assassin $60,000 worth of rare German stamps (not pictured) for the contract . Prosecutors say the 57-year-old handed him a photo of her husband, $10,000 in jewelery and a collection of German postage stamps she said were worth $60,000. Unbeknownst to Adams, her rendezvous with the would-be assassin held inside his car on Shore Parkway was recorded. 'It would look legitimate, just like an accident,' Elena allegedly told the officer, according to the prosecutor. 'If I'm lucky, you will make extra.’ Moments later, she was arrested by police and hauled off to the nearby 61st Precinct. Officials say the Manhattan resident chose Sheepshead Bay as the location for her husband's assassination because she believed there were fewer surveillance cameras in Brooklyn than in New York City. On Friday, Elena Adams was charged with conspiracy and solicitation charges in connection to the failed murder-for-hire plot, the New York Daily News reported. A judge ordered Adams held without bail and warned her to stay away from her husband. The Adamses lived in the same high-rise apartment building in Battery Park City where New York city Commissioner Ray Kelly resides, the New York Post reported. Jobless: Irving Adams, 66, worked as a chief compliance officer at Israel Discount Bank of New York until he was fired five years ago . Elite address: The couple lived in the same high-rise apartment building in Battery Park City as Police Commissioner Ray Kelly . The middle-aged couple have been described as odd by some of their neighbors, one of whom told the site DNAInfo.com that the two lived on a diet of Krispy Kream donuts and pizza. The unnamed resident added that even though it has been reported that Irving Adams has been out of work for the past five years, he and his wife appeared to be far from destitute, jetting off to ski vacations in Colorado several times a year. The man said that Elena Adams even showed him photos from her trips on her phone, and once mentioned that she owns a house in Romania. According to another account from a neighbor who spoke to the New York Daily News, the Adamses’ relationship was far from ideal, saying that the wife would talk on the phone in the hallway because she could not stand to be in the apartment with her husband.","Elena Sava Adams, 57, was arrested in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, after meeting with undercover officer .

A Connecticut photographer whose twin brother was born with cerebral palsy uses the camera lens to help come to terms with being born the healthy twin. Christopher Capozziello has documented his brother Nick’s life and its struggles for the last thirteen years and the collection of black and white photos will soon be published as a book. The collection, titled The Distance Between Us, is both a brother’s touching tribute and Capozziello’s attempt to come to terms with the reality his brother lives and one from which he happened to be spared. Twins: The Distance Between Us is Chris Capozziello's attempt to sort out what it means to be the twin who was born healthy . ‘The question I always asked myself as a child, and even sometimes now as an adult, is why did this happen to Nick and not me,’ Capozziello writes on a Kickstarter campaign page dedicated to help get his book published. ‘Why does this happen to anyone? The pictures ended up forcing me to deal with these questions.’ Capozziello has happily reached a fundraising goal of $16,000 and has stretched his goal to $25,000. Along with Austria-based publisher Lammerhuber, Capozziello is hoping to offset the cost of telling his story in book form. ‘For years,’ writes Capozziello, ‘I archived the pictures without ever looking at many of them. About ten years after the first pictures were made, and with a growing pile of photographs, I started to question why I continued to make these pictures.’ Looking for answers? Capozziello's brother Nick, pictured, was born with cerebral palsy while Capozziello was born healthy and The Distance Between Us asks the questions, Why? In The Distance Between Us, Capoziello documents his brother's ups and downs in stark black and white . Brothers: The Connecticut-based photographer calls his work a story of two brothers, not just a story about cerebral palsy . The photos primarily focus on Nick. He's seen struggling to perform everyday tasks, but also triumphing in ways large and smalll . Lighting a cigarette for a pretty girl is one of Nick's triumphs . Thus was born The Distance Between us. Photos of Nick are as uplifting as they are unflinching in their portrayal of Nick’s reality, one in which painful cramps and struggles to perform everyday tasks are commonplace. Whether his brother is lighting a pretty girl’s cigarette or taking communion at church, Capozziello finds a way to convey Nick’s struggles and his triumphs. Though it isn’t Nick’s illness that Capozziello is most interested in. Painful: The cerebral palsy causes Nick debilitating muscle cramps that can last from hours to days . 'Nick's countenance changes when a spasm is coming,' writes Capozziello. 'Even before his body goes rigid.' 'In November 2009, Nick had Brain Stimulation Surgery. 'DBS is cutting edge science but it look like medieval torture,' writes Capozziello . ‘It had little to do with showing what it is like to live with cerebral palsy,’ he says, ‘and more to do with sharing our story as brothers, and being open about my laments, and sharing how I began to move past the guilt I carried for being the healthy twin.’ The project has also allowed Capozziello to place his focus on the future. ‘The pictures have unexpectedly begun to help me move past my own grief, past my fears, and past our family to find out what lies ahead for Nick and me,’ he writes. ‘I don’t know how the future will look, but soon it will be just ours to figure out.’ Going home: Bandaged from his surgery, Nick prepares to leave the hospital . Family affairs: Nick' mother changing his bandages after brain surgery . 'He understands enough about the world to know what he¿s missing,"" Capozziello told the New York Times about his brother . 'The time I spend with him, looking through my camera, has forced me to ask questions about suffering and faith and why anyone is born with disability,' Capozziello writes . Learning: 'As I spent more and more time with the photographs, I began to see Nick more clearly as an individual, with his own set of wants and desires,' Capozziello says .",Chris Capozziello's The Distance Between Us portrays the life of his twin brother Nick over the last 13 years .

Two teens in Cypress, Texas believed to have been lured to San Antonio by a mysterious man they met on Facebook turn out to have planned the whole thing. The families of 16-year-old Liana Andrews and 14-year-old Kacie Watson were reunited with their daughters Sunday after they and Andrews' mother's car were reported missing August 16. Originally, they believed that the girls had been lured to San Antonio by a man named 'Shaun Hernandez' that they met on Facebook. Back home: 16-year-old Liana Andrews, left, and 14-year-old Kacie Andrews, right, were returned to their families Sunday after being reported missing for more than a week . Runaways: Police found journals written by the two girls left at home which detail their escape. They also believe that they created a fake Facebook profile for a man in San Antonio to cover their real plan to go to Denver . But it turns out that the two girls created Hernandez' profile in an attempt to cover up their tracks and eventually run away to Denver, Colorado. Their entire plan was written about in journals the two girls kept at their houses. 'They planned the whole trip,' Sergeant Doug Thomas told KHOU. 'We have two different journals - one from each girl. They planned down how far it takes to get from one city to the next. How much gas it takes and they even planned their potty breaks.' For some reason they left these journals behind when they left. The journal entries don't explain why they wanted to go to Denver or for how long. For the entire week that they were missing, their families made public appeals on TV and held vigils at local churches, praying for the girls' safe return. 'This is not a runaway case,' said Liana's mother Lana Turner in a press conference last week. 'My daughter and her friend are in danger. I know that and I want them found.' Eventually their plan faltered when the car they were driving was impounded. Andrews' mother had reported it missing so it was towed. Distraught: Liana's mother Lana Turner was convinced that a man named Shaun Hernandez had lured the two teens to San Antonio and that they were in danger . Discovered: The girls' plan fell apart when their car was impounded after it was reported missing. They were eventually found panhandling for money in a San Antonio parking lot . Investigators believe they left all of their belongings in the car, not knowing that it would be impounded. Desperate for money, the two girls were reported panhandling on a Walmart property in San Antonio. On Sunday, they were returned to their families. Neither will be charged as it's not against the law to runaway in Texas. Sgt Thomas has been investigating missing children cases for 10 years, and he says he's never seen a case like this.

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg officiate the same-sex wedding of her friends on Saturday in what is believed to be a first for a member of the nation's highest court. Ginsburg will officiate Saturday at the marriage of Kennedy Center President Michael Kaiser and John Roberts, a government economist. ‘Michael Kaiser is a friend and someone I much admire,’ Ginsburg said in a written statement Friday. ‘That is why I am officiating at his wedding.’ The private ceremony will take place at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a national memorial to President John F. Kennedy. The 80-year-old Ginsburg, an opera lover, is a frequent guest at the center. Trailblazer: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, center, has become the first Supreme Court Justice to officiate at a same-sex wedding. She married Michael M. Kaiser, left, and John Roberts, right, on Saturday . Same-sex marriage is legal in the District of Columbia and 13 states. ‘I think it will be one more statement that people who love each other and want to live together should be able to enjoy the blessings and the strife in the marriage relationship,’ Ginsburg told The Washington Post in an interview. ‘It won't be long before there will be another’ performed by a justice. She has another ceremony planned for September. Mr Kaiser told The Associated Press that he asked Ginsburg to officiate because she is a longtime friend. ‘It's very meaningful mostly to have a friend officiate, and then for someone of her stature, it's a very big honor,’ Kaiser said. ‘I think that everything that's going on that makes same-sex marriage possible and visible helps to encourage others and to make the issue seem less of an issue, to make it just more part of life.’ Happy couple: Kennedy Center President Michael Kaiser (left) and his fiance, economist John Roberts (right), will exchange their 'I dos' later today . Justices generally avoid taking stands on political issues. The wedding, though, comes after the court's landmark ruling in June to expand federal recognition of same-sex marriages, striking down part of an anti-gay marriage law. While hearing arguments in the case in March, Miss Ginsburg argued for treating marriages equally.

Road to recovery: Hans Rausing appeared healthy and composed this week as he prepares to leave court-ordered rehab . For two months, Hans Rausing hid his crack addict wife’s body in their £70million mansion as he struggled to face up to her death. So as the Tetra Pak heir prepares to return home from rehab for his own drug abuse, it is perhaps only natural he is keen to make a few changes to the place. As one of Britain’s richest men, of course, he has the resources to do it in style – and has plumped for a luxurious two-storey basement beneath the sprawling Grade II-listed property. The approved plans reveal that the underground development will include a swimming pool, gym, cigar room, wine store, plant room with rain water harvesting tank, cinema and lift. It will create 1,594 sq ft of extra floor space beneath the home, which is formed of two five-storey 19th-century townhouses and three linked mews buildings. The property, in London’s Belgravia, already features a ballroom, courtyard, staff quarters and garages for up to seven cars. Rausing, 49, heir to the £4.3billion Tetra Pak fortune, is the latest member of the super-rich to join the trend for ‘iceberg’ homes, where owners dig down below ground to create more space than traditional extensions. Based on other recent projects nearby in the wealthy borough of Kensington and Chelsea, it is estimated Rausing’s basement – which is equivalent in size to nearly three average terraced houses – will cost £2million to build. And it is not only his house which is undergoing a transformation. Photographed this week leaving the Bluebird Café in Chelsea with a blonde woman said to be a ‘family friend’ at his side, Rausing looked as though his treatment was doing him a power of good. His healthy appearance was in stark . contrast to his gaunt look in early May 2012, days before the death of . his 48-year-old American wife Eva. He was still sporting the beard he has grown since entering rehab, but the walking stick, Fidel Castro-style cap and unflattering hooped polo shirt he was seen wearing three months ago were all gone. Instead he was dressed smartly in a sports jacket and open-necked shirt, his wedding ring clearly visible on his finger. Mrs Rausing’s remains were found in the couple’s second floor bedroom at the house last summer after her husband was arrested on suspicion of possessing drugs.

Rausing was convicted of preventing her lawful burial and handed a ten-month suspended jail term. The judge at Isleworth Crown Court said Rausing was a tragic warning of the ‘utterly destructive’ effects of drug abuse. He moved out of the house last year to undergo a rehabilitation programme at a private clinic. Denial: Mr Rausing hid his wife's body as he struggled to come to terms with her death.

Venice authorities are investigating whether George Clooney broke the law by allegedly driving a gondola without a permit as he taxied himself to the watery city's film festival. Arriving in his typical smooth style, the film star was pictured apparently at the helm of the boat, wearing sunglasses and a tee-shirt advertising his own brand of tequila. People have turned a blind eye to the alleged illegal driving of the water-taxi - all bar one. Under investigation: George Clooney is being investigated for allegedly driving a Venice water taxi without a permit . Authorities said checks will be made to establish of Clooney was in command of the taxi as he attended the city's films festival . Venetian lawyer Mario D'Elia has reported the incident to authorities demanding that police take action against the star, according to The Telegraph. Piloting a city taxi in Venice requires a professional licence by law; Mr D'Elia has requested that Mr Clooney provides evidence he holds a licence, the paper said. Photos of the film star in Venice, with co-stars of his latest film 'Gravity', appear to show Clooney stood at the front of a gondola, behind the wheel, more than once. On one occasion he is wearing a grey tee-shirt with the logo of his own tequila on the front; in another he is wearing pale blue shirt with an open collar and a dark blue blazer. The claim that he drove without a permit comes as the city deals with criticisms that its waterways are chaotic and dangerous. If found to have been driving the taxi, the film star would be committing an administrative offence, in which case his taxi driver would be issued with a fine, an official said . Earlier this month, a German tourist was crushed and killed when the gondola he was travelling in collided with a vaporetto water taxi. The city's famous wooden punting boats have since been banned from entering Venice's Grand Canal - a trunk waterway through the city. Further investigation found the gondolier in command of the vessel tested positive for cocaine use, prompting a new regulation on drug and alcohol use to be rushed through as well. Clooney was pictured with co-star Sandra Bullock in the taxi while they were in the city promoting their new film 'Gravity' Clooney was seen smiling and apparently in the driving seat of the water taxi, with his film-star friends on board . The customary serenades that honeymooners have enjoyed for centuries will only be able to take place at night, according to the proposals, and vessel captains will no longer be allowed to use mobile phones while they are in control of a boat. Exceptions for film stars were not mentioned in the new laws, however, so authorities are now looking into the claims that Clooney was at the helm without a permit. If found to be true, the star of Syriana and Burn After Reading would get off lightly; his taxi driver, however, would face a fine. Dressed up: The U.S. actors were also spotted dressed in black tie outfits in the water taxi . Sandra Bullock and George Clooney attended the premiere and opening ceremony of the Venice Film Festival together on Wednesday . Quoted in the Telegraph, a town hall official played down the hype, saying: 'Photos in the papers do not represent proof, so checks will be made.' 'But if an offence was committed it would be an administrative offence punishable with a fine. And if it came to that, it would be the taxi owner, not Clooney, who would be fined.'

Tapped out: Rep Devin Nunes said during a radio interview on Wednesday night that the Justice Department has monitored calls out of the Congressional cloak room . The Justice Department's use of wiretapping has apparently not stopped with journalists, as one lawmaker has accused the agency of keeping tabs of elected officials where they relax. Republican Representative Devin Nunes of California claimed during a radio interview last night that the agency has monitored calls out of the U.S. Congress Republican cloak room - a hangout for members of party on Capitol Hill. As the interview turned to the Associated Press phone . records scandal, Representative Nunes said the Justice Department's actions go . beyond reporters to politicians. Representative Nunes told host Hugh Hewitt: 'I don’t think people are focusing on the . right thing when they talk about going after the AP reporters. The big . problem that I see is that they actually tapped right where I’m sitting . right now, the cloak room.' The room is not just a place for lawmakers to hang their coats; it's an area at the Capitol where members of both parties have conversations, sleep, or have a meal without leaving the building. It's also an area where many senators and members of Congress speak to reporters. Representatives Nunes said that the scandal makes a 'separation of powers issue.' He told Hewitt: 'So when they went after the AP reporters, right? Went after all of their phone records, they went after the phone records, including right up here in the House Gallery, right up from where I’m sitting right now. So you have a real separation of powers issue that did this really rise to the level that you would have to get phone records that would... most likely include members of Congress.' A place to relax: The cloak rooms are not just a place for lawmakers to hang their coats; it's an area at the Capitol elected officials have discussions, talk, sleep, or have a meal without leaving the building . The startling revelation comes as a growing number of journalists and politicians have called for the resignation of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder over the Justice Department's largely unprecedented acquisition of hundreds of reporters' call logs. Republican National Chairman Reince Priebus was one of the first people to call for Holder to quit, along with former Current TV hosts Keith Olbermann and David Shuster. 'The First Amendment doesn't request the federal government to respect it; it demands it,' Priebus said. 'Attorney General Eric Holder, in permitting the Justice Department to issue secret subpoenas to spy on Associated Press reporters, has trampled on the First Amendment and failed in his sworn duty to uphold the Constitution.' Olbermann called for Holder to resign . via Twitter, saying, 'If Mr Holder continues to support this rogue . action, he should resign.' Under fire: A growing number of journalists and politicians are calling for the resignation of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder over the Justice Department's largely unprecedented acquisition of hundreds of reporters' call logs . Your move, Barack: Lawmakers and journalists alike have said that it's time for President Obama to show Holder the door . Shuster, on the other hand, said Holder should be fired. 'The DOJ's collection of AP phone records is outrageous and sickening,' Shuster tweeted. 'Mr. President, you must fire AG Holder.' Esquire magazine's Charles P. Pierce and Newsweek/Daily Beast correspondent Michael Tomasky concurred. 'He should be gone. This moment,' Pierce wrote on the website of the men's magazine. 'Not only is this constitutionally abhorrent, it is politically moronic.' Claims: Holder claims he recused himself from the investigation in which the justice department obtained two months' worth of call logs from roughly 100 Associated Press editors and reporters . Former Current TV host Keith Olbermann called for Holder to resign via Twitter, saying, 'If Mr. Holder continues to support this rogue action, he should resign' In a post titled, 'Obama should ask holder to resign,' Tomasky said he doesn't expect the president to actually give the attorney general a pink slip. 'He’s going to stand by Eric Holder for now and let some interminable process play out,' Tomasky predicted. But, he argued, 'he ought to ask for Holder’s resignation. This week. Enough already. Holder's rights here aren't more important than Obama sending a strong signal that he is in charge and can make hard decisions.' 'This isn’t a time for letting processes play out,' Tomasky added. 'This is a time to take action.' Holder claims he recused himself from the investigation in which the justice department obtained two months' worth of call logs from roughly 100 Associated Press editors and reporters. The records list outgoing calls for the work and personal phone numbers of individual reporters as well as general AP office numbers in several bureaus.","Rep Devin Nunes of California claims that the Department of Justice has tapped the phones in the Republican cloak room at the Capitol .

The UK could launch a military strike against Syria without the support of the United Nations, government legal advice released today claims. Downing Street published the official legal position suggesting Britain would not breach international law if it launched ‘military intervention to strike specific targets with the aim of deterring and disrupting’ further use of chemical weapons. And the government released an intelligence report – likened to the so-called Iraq dodgy dossier – which claimed it is ‘highly likely’ that the Syrian regime was responsible for a chemical attack in Damascus on August 21. Scroll down for video <!-- br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --> . Legal advice: Prime Minister David Cameron leaves Downing Street for the Commons debate on Syria . David Cameron had hoped to secure the backing of the House of Commons for imminent military action in a crunch vote tonight. But Labour leader Ed Miliband has refused to back the government, setting seven different conditions which would need to be met before the opposition would support an air strike. MPs have been recalled to Parliament to debate the UK response to the use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people. Mr Miliband wants the government to pursue any action through the United Nations, but both Russia and China have vowed to veto any UN resolution backing military action. Ahead of this afternoon’s debate, Number 10 released its legal position insisting Britain could legally go it alone and support the United States in a targeted strike to act as a deterrent for future use of chemical weapons. Justifiable: The two-page legal position insists . Britain could carry out a targeted military strike against Syria . without securing a UN resolution . The legal advice states: ‘Previous . attempts by the UK and its international partners to secure a resolution . of this conflict, end its associated humanitarian suffering and prevent . the use of chemical weapons through meaningful action by the Security . Council have been blocked over the last two years.' It argues that if Russia and China continue to block action through the UN Security Council there would be 'no practicable alternative' to the use of force to 'deter and degrade the capacity for the further use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime'. It adds: ‘In these circumstances, and as an exceptional measure on grounds of overwhelming humanitarian necessity, military intervention to strike specific targets with the aim of deterring and disrupting further such attacks would be necessary and proportionate and therefore legally justifiable. ‘Such an intervention would be directed exclusively to averting a humanitarian catastrophe, and the minimum judged necessary for that purpose.’ As the main party leaders briefed . their MPs on their return to Westminster for the emergency recall of . Parliament, six RAF Typhoon jets were deployed to Cyprus to protect UK . interests and sovereign bases. The . Prime Minister yesterday battled desperately to get a consensus for a . missile attack, but was forced by Mr Miliband and Tory rebels to allow . UN inspectors time to report on last week’s chemical weapons atrocity. Top brass: Chief of the defence staff, General Sir Nick Houghton (L) and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond arrive for a cabinet meeting at Number 10 . Cabinet: International Development Secretary . Justine Greening, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Home Secretary . Theresa May were briefed on the latest developments in Number 10 today . But a three page dossier from the Joint Intelligence Committee made clear that the Assad regime was responsible for the chemical weapons attack last week in which 350 died. The JIC found there are 'no plausible alternative scenarios to Assad's regime being behind the attack and has given the Prime Minister full access to 'highly sensitive' intelligence. It could not, however, come up with a 'precise motivation' for the attack. It concludes: ‘It is not possible for the opposition to have carried out a chemical weapons attack on this scale. ‘The regime has used chemical weapons on a smaller scale on at least 14 occasions in the past. ‘There is some intelligence to suggest regime culpability in this attack. These factors make it highly likely that the Syrian regime was responsible.’ Cabinet ministers were briefed on the latest intelligence this morning, ahead of the Commons debate. A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘The judgment of the Joint Intelligence Committee is that a chemical weapons attack did occur in Damascus last week; that it is highly likely that the Syrian regime was responsible; that there is some intelligence to suggest regime culpability; and that no opposition group has the capability to conduct a chemical weapons attack on this scale. ‘Ministers agreed that it is fundamentally in our national interest to uphold the longstanding convention on chemical weapons and to make clear that they cannot be used with impunity. ‘Any response should be legal, proportionate and specifically in response to this attack and everyone around the Cabinet table agreed that it is not about taking sides in the Syrian conflict nor about trying to determine the outcome.’ Here is the full text of the Joint Intelligence Committee assessment of the Syrian chemical weapons attack, followed by a letter from Jon Day, chairman of the JIC, to the Prime Minister:JIC assessment of 27 August on Reported Chemical Weapons use in Damascus . A chemical attack occurred in Damascus on the morning of 21 August, resulting in at least 350 fatalities. It is not possible for the opposition to have carried out a CW [chemical weapons] attack on this scale. The regime has used CW on a smaller scale on at least 14 occasions in the past. There is some intelligence to suggest regime culpability in this attack. These factors make it highly likely that the Syrian regime was responsible. Extensive video footage attributed to the attack in eastern Damascus (which we assess would be very difficult to falsify) is consistent with the use of a nerve agent, such as sarin, and is not consistent with the use of blister or riot control agents. There is no obvious political or military trigger for regime use of CW on an apparently larger scale now, particularly given the current presence in Syria of the UN investigation team. Permission to authorise CW has probably been delegated by President Asad to senior regime commanders, such as [*], but any deliberate change in the scale and nature of use would require his authorisation. There is no credible evidence that any opposition group has used CW. A number continue to seek a CW capability, but none currently has the capability to conduct a CW attack on this scale. Russia claims to have a 'good degree of confidence' that the attack was an 'opposition provocation' but has announced that they support an investigation into the incident. We expect them to maintain this line. The Syrian regime has now announced that it will allow access to the sites by UN inspectors. There is no immediate time limit over which environmental or physiological samples would have degraded beyond usefulness. However, the longer it takes inspectors to gain access to the affected sites, the more difficult it will be to establish the chain of evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. From Jon Day, chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee to the Prime Minister: . SYRIA: REPORTED CHEMICAL WEAPONS USE . Following the widespread open source reports of chemical weapons (CW) use in the suburbs of Damascus in the early hours of 21 August 2013, the JIC met on 25 August to agree an assessment. At a subsequent meeting on 27 August we met again to review our level of confidence in the assessment relating to the regime's responsibility for the attack. The JIC's conclusions were agreed by all Committee members. The final paper informed the National Security Council meeting on 28 August, at which I provided further background and a summary of the most recent reporting, analysis and challenge. The paper's key judgements, based on the information and intelligence available to us as of 25 August, are attached. It is important to put these JIC judgements in context. We have assessed previously that the Syrian regime used lethal CW on 14 occasions from 2012. This judgement was made with the highest possible level of certainty following an exhaustive review by the Joint Intelligence Organisation of intelligence reports plus diplomatic and open sources. We think that there have been other attacks although we do not have the same degree of confidence in the evidence. A clear pattern of regime use has therefore been established. Unlike previous attacks, the degree of open source reporting of CW use on 21 August has been considerable. As a result, there is little serious dispute that chemical attacks causing mass casualties on a larger scale than hitherto (including, we judge, at least 350 fatalities) took place. It is being claimed, including by the regime, that the attacks were either faked or undertaken by the Syrian Armed Opposition. We have tested this assertion using a wide range of intelligence and open sources, and invited HMG and outside experts to help us establish whether such a thing is possible. There is no credible intelligence or other evidence to substantiate the claims or the possession of CW by the opposition. The JIC has therefore concluded that there are no plausible alternative scenarios to regime responsibility. We also have a limited but growing body of intelligence which supports the judgement that the regime was responsible for the attacks and that they were conducted to help clear the Opposition from strategic parts of Damascus. Some of this intelligence is highly sensitive but you have had access to it all. Against that background, the JIC concluded that it is highly likely that the regime was responsible for the CW attacks on 21 August. The JIC had high confidence in all of its assessments except in relation to the regime's precise motivation for carrying out an attack of this scale at this time - though intelligence may increase our confidence in the future. There has been the closest possible cooperation with the Agencies in producing the JIC's assessment. We have also worked in concert with the US intelligence community and agree with the conclusions they have reached.

Already a household name before he graduated from the University of Florida after winning two national titles and the Heisman Trophy as the sport’s best player in 2007, Tebow’s candid talk about his faith and never-ending charity work converted legions of fans to ‘Tebowmania.’ Tebow was in the NFL spotlight long before he even donned a pro uniform. The most high-profile player in college sports, Tebow often inscribed biblical verses into his eye black, such as ‘John 3:16,’ causing the term to be searched over 94 million times on Google, according to USA Today.

I wanted to take advantage of that for one more year, be a good role model for the kids that look up to me,’ when announcing his decision to return to college for his senior year. The National Collegiate Athletic Association soon implemented a rule against allowing messages in eye black, which media dubbed the ‘Tebow Rule.’ In a trend that started in college . and carried over to the NFL, Tebow began every press conference by . saying 'first I'd like to thank my Lord and savior, Jesus Christ.'

'These . things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the . world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer - I have overcome . the world.' Tebow is famous for 'Tebowing,' an act where the player dropped to one knee and prayed in the corner of the end zone after each game, became a national phenomenon and took social media by storm - with thousands taking pictures mimicking the pose everywhere imaginable. 'The greatest form of flattery is imitation, but I think that just that prayer is being talked about is pretty cool,' Tebow told ABC News. A shocker: Many were astounded when the Denver Broncos picked Tebow 25th overall in the first round of the 2010 NFL Draft . Highly successful: The draft surprise was likely the result of winning two national titles . An ad that aired during the 2010 Super Bowl featured a woman talking about how she contracted an infection during a visit to the Phillippines while pregnant. The medicine she took to beat the infection would likely harm her unborn fetus, she remembered doctors saying. Undeterred, she gave birth to a healthy baby boy not long after – that boy was Tim Tebow, who then joined his mother on camera. Picked 25th overall by the Denver Broncos in the first round of the 2010 NFL Draft. Tebow was cheered by casual fans and religious devotees, but football experts doubted his ability to be a successful NFL quarterback due to an unusual throwing motion and streaky accuracy. That the team traded away three other draft picks to get the maligned QB, mattered little to coach Josh McDaniels. ‘He has all the traits you look for. It's a good pick,’ McDaniels said of Tebow. Tebow set an NFL record before even stepping onto the field, by logging the highest draft weekend jersey sales tally in league history, according to Bloomberg. Played sparingly his rookie season in 2010, Tebow entered halfway through the team’s fifth game of the 2011 season and almost led them to a furious comeback win. He was anointed the ‘Mile High Messiah’ when he was announced as the starter for the next game. Trailing 15-0 with about three minutes left in the game, Tebow began one of the most improbable runs in league history by leading the team to an 18-15 overtime win over the Miami Dolphins. Another bible verse: Though he most-often selected John 3:16, Tebow also picked other bible verses to inscribe into his eye black . The team then decisively won their next two games before miraculously pulling off three come-from-behind wins in a row and somehow putting them into the playoffs. The Broncos then knocked the defending champion Pittsburgh Steelers out of the playoffs when Tebow threw a jaw-dropping 80-yard touchdown pass on the first play of overtime to win the game. Amazingly, Tebow finished with 316 passing yards on 10 completions, for an NFL-record 31.6 yards per catch. Even more curiously, the numbers matched the bible verse religious signal caller often inscribed in his eye black while playing in college. Also known for his overwhelming amount of charity work, Tebow . That would be the last touchdown pass Tim Tebow would throw in the NFL. The Broncos lost their next game and traded him to the New York Jets. Though he arrived with much fanfare, and was likely the only backup quarterback with an underwear ad over the Lincoln Tunnel, his stay in New York was short-lived – he was cut from the team at season’s end. Last stand: Tebow playing erratically in a Patriots uniform during the 2013 preseason might be the last image of the polarizing player in the NFL . Weekly ritual: If Tebow's career is over, he ended it the same way he does every game, leading a prayer circle made up of players from both sides at the end of every game . Despite backing up a historically-inept quarterback, Tebow saw limited action and his tenure went largely unnoticed outside of a controversial church he planned to speak at and then backed away after public outcry. Tebow signed with the New England Patriots prior to the start of training camp for the 2013 season, but with his release today – one week before the season begins – it looks like Tebowmania may finally be over, despite the maligned player’s determination to be an NFL quarterback. During his short time with the Patriots, it was revealed by a longtime scout appearing on a Boston radio show that a Major League Baseball team was considering drafting Tim Tebow shortly after he graduated college. Which team? The (Los Angeles) Angels, or course. Thanking the Patriots owners and coaches, Tebow tweeted Saturday afternoon to his almost 2.4million followers ‘I pray for nothing but the best for you all. I will remain in relentless pursuit of continuing my lifelong dream of being an NFL quarterback.' He then, as always, ended with a bible verse. This time it was 2 Corinthians 12:9. ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.’","Tim Tebow won two national titles in college as quarterback of the University of Florida Gators .

The mother of a British educated artist who claims her father is Belgium's abdicated King Albert II, has spoken publicly for the first time about her alleged love affair with him. Sybille de Sélys Longchamps has broken her silence after 42 years because she says the Royal family's treatment of her daughter was unacceptable. In a documentary due to be aired on RTL, and in exclusive interviews published in Paris Match, the aristocrat mother, 72, claims the palace told her to 'hide her daughter' when she first approached them. Broken silence: Sybille de Sélys Longchamps (L) has spoken publicly for the first time about her alleged 18-year affair with Belgium's abdicated King Albert II, who she says is the father of her artist daughter Delphine Boël (R, pictured in 2001) Since the age of 17, Delphine Boël says she had known who her father allegedly was, but was told to keep it quiet. It was only in 1999, aged 32, she decided to reveal the identity - something the former king has continued to deny. Speculators claim his abdication last month to his son, Philippe, was in part due to a pending lawsuit by Boël against him. He said it was as a result of his 'age and health'. In the forthcoming television programme, Mrs Sélys Longchamps will reveal she allegedly met the former king in 1966, in Athens, sparking an 18-year love affair with married Albert. Albert, a prince at the time, was then living separately from his Italian wife Paola, according to The Times. When Delphine was born, she claimed Prince Albert initially showed affection towards her. When they asked for a divorce, the palace and the Belgian government said it would only be possible if he was also cut off from his legitimate children. Unwilling to accept those terms, Mrs Sélys Longchamps said she decided to flee to the UK and begin a new life. She married someone else. It was first revealed that Albert allegedly fathered an illegitimate child in a book published in 1999, and middle-aged artist Ms Boël is adamant that she is the child in question. Silence: For 15 years, Delphine kept quiet about her the alleged identity of her Royal father, whom her mother met in Athens in 1966 . Both mother and daughter, interviewed by Paris Match on Monday, on a boat off the English coast, talked about the difficulties of being unable to speak about their secret. The mother said she took he daughter to England to save her from any suffering she might experience being rejected by the Royal family and not being able to speak about it. She said Mazarine Pingeot, the daughter of François Mitterrand, who was also hidden from the public during her youth, suffered because of it. (Mitterand has now recognised his daughter.) Ms Boël said before 1999, she couldn't say anything. She claims she had known and kept quiet from the age of 17. Her mother assured her that she was old enough at the age to handle it. When asked how people react to her claimed royal identity, Ms Boel said people are mostly 'disappointed', because their dream of royalty incorporates a 'prince charming' figure with high values and a good education. Unstable: Albert's (R) marriage to Queen Paola (L) is understood to have been turbulent at times, with the couple spending long spells living apart over the years . Emotional: The king's abdication last month was said to be due to 'age and health'; commentators claimed the pending parental court procedures were also a factor . So when they realise the truth, it is like a dream has been broken. Her mother said she also finds it 'ridiculous and inconsistent'.. The mother and daughter told Paris Match that since the initial 'shock' revelation, attitudes towards them have gradually softened, although they still hear whispers behind their backs. Mrs Sélys Longchamps said: 'They (people in Belgium) are used to seeing Delphine now. Compared with the shock of 1999, it has become almost normal.' She said when the secret was first exposed, she stopped going to her local gym. She said most people have talked about it among themselves already; now, she only occasionally hears whispers. Mrs Sélys Longchamps has previously said that her daughter, a successful artist, has lived a better life than if she had been accepted into the royal family. Related? Ms Sélys Longchamps claims it is clear Delphine is Albert's daughter because she looks just like him . She said of that lifestyle: 'It must be horrible. I think the fact that she is an artist has helped Delphine. Fortunately she wasn't a little secretary crushed behind a computer - that could have sunk her into depression. 'The fact that she expresses herself, that she enjoys her work, can only give her balance,' she told Paris Match. When asked if it would be better to be recognised as the former king's daughter, despite everything, Ms Boël said that even if her father was a murderer in prison, it doesn't matter, he would always be her father. She said: 'The most important and the best thing is to be recognised.' Mrs Sélys Longchamps admitted she didn't like to talk about it. Albert's marriage to Queen Paola is understood to have been turbulent at times, with the couple spending long spells living apart over the years and coming close to divorce in the past. A Brussels court is due to open a case next week relating to Ms Boël's request for DNA tests. According to The Times, Belgian commentators expect Albert to reach an agreement with Ms Boël before her demand reaches the court.","In a forthcoming documentary, Sebille de Sélys Longchamps, 72, will reveal she allegedly met the former king in 1966, in Athens .

Li Tianyi, 17, and four other men have denied taking part in the February incident at a Beijing hotel that followed a night of heavy drinking. Li is the son of Li Shuangjiang, one of China’s most famous military leaders, who has reportedly fallen ill as a result of his son’s arrest. On trial: Li Tianyi, 17, and four other men are charged with the gang rape of woman in a Beijing hotel . If convicted, the baby-faced teenager could serve from three to 10 years, although the law allows for harsher punishment if the case is considered especially serious. A group of . journalists awaited Li and his four co-defendants as they were driven . through the gate of Beijing's Haidian District Court. The case is not . open to the public because Li is a minor. His . father Li Shuangjiang is a general famed for singing patriotic anthems . for the People's Liberation Army and often stars in television galas.

He sent to a detention centre for a year after being convicted of assaulting a couple in the street who blocked the path of the BMW he was driving. Li was ridiculed in the media as a spoiled brat and his father was forced to make a public apology for failing to check his son's bad behavior. A video has emerged, published by South China Morning Post, showing General Li referring to his 12 year old son in 2006, meaning his son is now 19 and should then possibly have been tried as an adult in the 2010 incident. Amid anger over corruption and a widening wealth gap, many Chinese have become increasingly impatient with the antics of the ‘wealthy second generation’ seen as using their parents' money and connections to avoid repercussions for illegal or outrageous behavior.","Li Tianyi, 17, and four others stand accused of rape .

Trekking across the world's harshest and most remote regions sounds like a tough enough challenge - but imagine doing the whole thing on a unicycle. Canadian Kris Holm has traversed the Great Wall of China, descended a 6000-metre volcano and braved the mountains of the Himalayas while riding on a single wheel. As these breathtaking pictures show, he . is not afraid of tackling any terrain - from perilous cliff edges to . jagged mountain tops. Vista: Kris Holm on the Moab White Rim in Utah. The brave unicyclist has crossed 14 countries and beaten some of the world's most difficult terrain . Epic: An amazed Chinese man watches Holm perilously ride the side of the Great Wall of China . Mr Holm has travelled across some of the toughest terrains in the world, including Himalayan country Bhutan and the jungles of Bolivia. He said: 'I do get some odd looks sometimes on my travels. They know me round where I live, but abroad people do give me funny looks. 'Actually in countries like Mongolia and Bhutan it wasn't necessarily because of the unicycle, they just shrugged me off as Western so I must be doing something weird. 'Some of them actually thought it was what Westerners do, ride unicycles all the time. If only that was the case. 'I have travelled on the Great Wall of China, descended down Licancabur, a 5950-metre volcano in Bolivia, and climbed the third highest mountain in North America.' Leap of faith: Mr Holm fearlessly drops from a rock in sun-baked Utah . Brave: Mr Holm on the North Shore, Canada. Such is his skill that he has even beaten two-wheeled competitors in trial competitions . Kris was the first rider to bring mountain unicycling to a mainstream audience through film, television, and magazine features. He has appeared in over 200 international media features, including numerous television segments and 18 films that have screened at festivals in over 30 countries, according to his website. He added: 'A unicycle can go just as many places as a two-wheeled bike. Obviously over a flat distance two wheels are faster, but actually up and down hill it doesn't make that much difference.' Amazingly, Holm, who can reach speeds . of 50mph, became the first unicyclist to reach the podium in an event . against his two-wheeled cousins in the gruelling seven-day mountain BC Bike Race in 2010. Riding high: The extreme unicyclist balances on the edge of a cliff in Mexico . Author: Mr Holm has written a book about his adventures called Mountain and Trials Unicycling . He added: 'I actually finished third last year in the BC Bike Race as the only competitor among 500 riders on one wheel, that was amazing.' Holm started uni-cycling in 1986 aged just 12 after getting the bike as a present. He said: 'I was like any kid, I just kept practicing and soon I was riding. Learning to ride a unicycle is just like anything else it's 95 percent practice. 'Where I live in Canada there is a lot of outdoors and I love to go out on the trials, so a lot of people are used to seeing me.' In 2010 Kris became the first unicyclist to reach the podium in 3rd place against his two-wheeled cousins in the gruelling seven-day mountain BC Bike Race . Mountain king: Mr Holm in Bhutan. He designs and sells his own mountain unicycles . He has helped popularise the fringe sport through his appearances in TV documentaries and features in numerous magazines . 'When I first started unicycling I was probably one of the only people in the world to try and ride the same trials as two-wheeled bikes but now there are more and more people willing to give it a try. 'I also design my own unicycles which are made for those who want to give trialing a go, it's a lot cheaper than mountain biking to buy a unicycle so who knows maybe more and more people will do it.' His talents saw him scoop the 2005 European, 2002 World, and 1999 North American unicycle trials championships. He has also written a book about his adventures, Mountain and Trials Unicycling.

A Texas mother posted an open letter on her blog Monday urging her 13-year-old daughter to use Miley Cyrus as a example of the kind of girl she should never become. Kim Keller of Frisco runs a blog called Roadkill Goldfish and used it to vent the extreme anger she felt after watching Cyrus’s now-infamous Video Music Award performance. Thirty-six hours later, the letter titled Dear Daughter, Let Miley Cyrus Be a Lesson to You had gained 3 million views. Scroll down for video . Incited: Texas blogger and mom Kim Keller was so shocked by Miley Cyrus's VMA performance that she wrote an open letter to her daughter titled Dear Daughter, Let Miley Cyrus Be a Lesson To You . ‘If you ever even consider doing something like that, I promise you that I will run up and twerk so you will see how ridiculous twerking looks,’ Keller wrote. ‘I will duct tape your mouth shut so your tongue doesn't hangout like an overheated hound dog.’ Humor like that runs throughout Keller’s heartfelt letter, which as of Thursday evening had received 1,400 comments. ‘I’m sorry if you’ve ever felt demoralized because your Instagram following isn’t in the thousands. I’m sorry those “selfies” can never capture how amazingly beautiful you truly are.’ In addition to laughs, the letter offers straightforward advice. Keller posted her letter on Monday and by Thursday it had 3 million views and thousands of comments . All grown up? Cyrus's performance made Keller 'absolutely angry,' after years of watching her children's show Hannah Montana with her daughter . Cyrus's performance has won her as many fans as detractors and she has shown no desire to apologize for her risque choices . A different time: Keller has argued that 20-year-old Cyrus, seen here in her child star days, may not be a role model but she is a public figure with an underage following . ‘You probably know girls who will emulate this behavior at the next school dance,’ she wrote. ‘Don’t do it with them. You are far too valuable to sell yourself so cheaply.’ Part of Keller’s frustration, and part of what drove her to write the wildly popular letter, came from the years Keller and her daughter spent watching Cyrus’s Disney program together. The massive response to Keller's letter won her invitations to Good Mornign America and Piers Morgan and she even wrote a post script response to critics who called her prudish . In the years after Hannah Montana, Keller believes Cyrus has been dying for attention and that the most recent, and blatant, attempt at it made her ‘absolutely angry.’ In a chat with Good Morning America, Keller also offered Cyrus some motherly advice. ‘If I could say anything to Miley, I would say this: 'Honey you are beautiful, you are valuable, you are loved, and you don't have to do this for attention. This is not who God created you to be,”’ she said. The final sentence of Keller’s letter probably sums it up best: ‘You can thank me later.’ Watch more of the interview at Good Morning America .","'Fight or die trying': Kim Keller says she'll do anything to keep her 13-year-old daughter from being like Cyrus .

Vets have found a novel way of treating an albino alligator who suffers from back and leg problems. Bino was born eight years ago with the apparently incurable ailments of hunchback and scoliosis - but he is now receiving acupuncture at the Sao Paulo Aquarium, where he has lived since 2007. Once a week, several needles are inserted into Bino's back - and the treatment is working. He is already able to twitch his tail again and move his back legs, which until recently he was unable to do. Scroll down for video . Scoliosis sufferer: Bino, the albino alligator, receives acupuncture treatment. Veterinarians at the Sao Paulo Aquarium in Brazil decided on the novel treatment for Bino, who suffers from hunchback and scoliosis . In early 2011 veterinarians at the aquarium in Brazil decided to see if acupuncture might help Bino, as it has with other animals living at the aquarium. ‘The . acupuncture will ... alleviate his pain and keep all his vital . functions going,’ said Rafael Gutierrez, a biologist at the aquarium of . Sao Paulo. He added that the 30-minute weekly treatments would continue indefinitely, as long as they kept showing solid results. Acupuncture . on animals is becoming increasingly common around the globe, the . biologists at the Sao Paulo aquarium said, especially with pets such as . cats, dogs and horses. The use of acupuncture on animals began thousands of years ago in China. Technique: This is a file picture of acupuncture needles in a person's leg. The ancient treatment was first practised in China around 1,000 years ago, and arrived in Europe in the 17th century . In . the US, the number of veterinarians who hold membership in the American . Academy of Veterinary Acupuncture has jumped 50 per cent in the last . few years to 900 doctors, said Simon Flynn, the executive director of . the academy that is based in Glastonbury, Connecticut. What is acupuncture? An ancient treatment first practised in China around 1,000 years ago. It arrived in Europe in the 17th century, but there has only been strong public interest in it since the 1970s. How does it work? The traditional Chinese view is that energy - or 'Qi' - flows directly through 12 main channels, called meridians, in the body and if the flow is interrupted it can cause ill-health. Inserting tiny needles and manipulating them at 'trigger points' restores the flow of energy. It is believed the needles stimulate skin and muscle nerves, releasing the body's natural painkillers - endorphins and serotonin - into the pain pathways of the spinal cord and the brain to modify the way pain signals are received.What is it used to treat? Some people have acupuncture to 'strengthen' their constitution. But it is commonly used for anxiety, asthma, arthritis, depression, high blood pressure, infertility, menstrual problems, migraines, rheumatism, skin conditions and ulcers. By PAT HAGAN . ‘There . are many zoo veterinarians who use acupuncture, a number of equine . practitioners who treat race horses with acupuncture, it's proven to be a . useful treatment,’ Mr Flynn said. ‘It's . common with dogs and it's becoming increasingly common with cats. More . veterinarians are seeing the worth of the treatment.’ Typical . ailments treated by acupuncture include neck and back issues, skin . problems and pain in general, among other complaints, he added. Bino . requires a few precautions not needed with your average house cat. Inserting the needles into Bino's back requires the important first step . of taping shut his lock-tight jaws full of sharp teeth. Bino . wrestles around a bit as the tape is applied, but soon calms down. Vet . Daniela Cervaletti then slides behind Bino, firmly pressing the needles . into his leathery white and yellow hide. The needles are inserted along his spine and around the area where the animal developed a hunchback. Bino . does not move at all as nearly a dozen needles go in. Ms Cervaletti . gently strokes the side of Bino's neck after she applies them all, then . waits several minutes before removing them. The . treatment complete, handlers help Bino back into a display pool, his . white skin stark against brown fake rocks painted with foliage. He . moves easily and swishes his tail, gliding along the water as a group of schoolchildren in matching uniforms squeal in . delight, faces pressed up against the glass separating them from Bino.","Bino the alligator has lived at Sao Paulo Aquarium in Brazil since 2007 .

Sewell was home alone on August 16 when she saw the creature, which she described as being about three inches across. Just . a few days prior, her mom Shawnda had been bitten by a spider on the . back of her leg during the night, which had resulted in a nasty wound . and a trip to the emergency room. Initially Sewell tried to call her mother, her father, the friends her parents were with, her own friends and two neighbors. When she couldn’t reach anyone, Sewell decided to call the non-emergency police hotline as a last resort. Makenna Sewell said she felt silly calling police to kill the spider, but said she legitimately feared for her safety . Makenna, who has muscular dystrophy, said she was afraid that the spider - which she believed to be a deadly venomous brown recluse - would harm her or little brother . The audio from her police call reveals a rather comical scene. 'I'm . home alone and there is a giant spider on the back of my couch, and I'm . talking giant. I've never seen a spider this big and I have no idea . what to do,' she told the slightly perplexed operator. The teen estimated the spider was the size of a baseball and said it was appeared similar to a tarantula. She . told the dispatcher that she generally wasn't fazed by spiders, but a . family member was recently bitten by one and had to go to the hospital. She also explained that she had initially tried to get hold of her parents but failed. 'I . don't know if you guys have anything I can do, or if I just sit here . and stare at it and wait for someone to get home to kill it,' she asked. The . dispatcher is heard telling her that since she doesn't feel safe, he . will send someone over to her house. In the end, a total of four police . officers showed up at their house. When . the officers arrived at the home, they reported finding a spider that . was about two inches in diameter and they quickly disposed of it with an . old-fashioned rolled up newspaper. Throughout the situation, Sewell said the officers remained professional, despite the seemingly absurd circumstances. A . student at Forest Grove High School in a suburb of Portland, Sewell . admits she felt silly calling the police department to kill a spider - . but she insists it really was a danger to her and her brother. Spider: A Seattle teen recently called 911 to report an intruder in her home, pictured, but rather than a brazen thief, it turned out to be a 'massive freaking' spider . 'Just . seeing a spider that big and knowing what it did to my immune system . and me having a compromised immune system and a younger brother, I just . knew that it wasn't good and I had to call someone,' Sewell told KPTV. Though . it's not standard protocol for them to respond to a call about a . spider, Forest Grove police said they decided to help the young lady out . in this instance. Makenna . said they insisted she keep the dead spider and send it in for testing - . because they had never seen one that big, either. She . also said she feels grateful that she lives in the sort of town where a . teenager can summon a police officer to kill a spider.

The spate of terrifying night-time rapes in an isolated, orthodox Christian community went on for four years and yet the victims could barely remember the ordeal and many believed they had dreamed it. It was not until 2009 that nine men were eventually convicted of the rape of more than 100 women and girls in their own homes in the Mennonite Manitoba Colony in Bolivia. But despite the convictions, it has emerged that the sexual attacks in the closed community are continuing. More than 100 women and girls were raped in the Mennonite Manitoba Colony in Bolivia but despite the convictions four years ago residents have admitted that the sexual assaults have continued (file picture) An investigation has uncovered that once more women and youngsters in the Old Colony, where motorised vehicles and electricity are banned, are suffering sexual assaults they can barely remember. Vice.com has found that many families believe the assaults are continuing despite the men, aged 19 to 43, being jailed. But members of the closed community told Vice . that without cameras or streetlights - both forbidden in the community - or a police force, they have no way to stop or catch the rapists. They say they will have to wait until someone is caught in the act and in the meantime increase security at their homes. One husband, whose wife was raped in the first spate of attacks, told Vice.com: 'It's definitely not as frequent. [The rapists] are being much more careful than before, but it still goes on.' From 2005 to 2009, women complained that they regularly woke up to intense pain and semen and blood on their sheets but their claims were not initially investigated and they were not believed. Some even reported waking up to find rope tied to their wrists or ankles or dirty fingerprints on their bodies but the victims could not remember the previous night. Many women had hazy memories or images of at least one man on top of them but they were not able to resist. Residents say they have heard repeated rumours that the night-time rapes have continued but because the closed community does not have a police force the alleged crimes are unlikely to be investigated (file picture) The Manitoba Colony in eastern Bolivia is home to about 3,000 people . The eventual trial found that the attackers used a powerful sedative to drug whole families before carrying out the rapes. Many . women were attacked as they lay next to their husbands, who were also . knocked unconscious by the narcotic. A girl of just three was among the victims and a woman of 60 years old. A pregnant woman gave birth at just six and a half months after being raped while unconscious. Young girls were taken to hospital the next morning suffering from terrible pain and bleeding. The gang of men, who had led some women to believe they were repeatedly attacked by demons, were eventually caught and jailed in 2009. Two of the men were found trying to break into a house and their story unraveled. Each of the nine-strong gang were jailed for 25 years and a vet who supplied the anaesthetic  - made from a cow tranquilizer - was sentenced to 12 years. The colony - about 94 miles from Santa Cruz and home to about 3,000 ultraconservative Mennonites - has been deeply scarred by the scandal. Sara Guenter told Vice that she tried to stay awake and asked a trusted worker to guard the house but the attacks continued when no one was watching her home. She said: 'It happened so many times, I lost count.' Some residents initially believed the rape claims were concocted to hide affairs while others believed it was down to 'wild female imagination.' Electricity is banned in the Old . Colonies and the community lives off the land. Men and women's roles are . strictly segregated with men working as farmers and given extra education whereas . women only are responsible for cleaning and cooking. The community has no police force so no one investigated the claims until two men were finally caught trying to break into a neighbour's house. Before that there had been no investigation and the authorities were accused of turning a blind eye to the situation. Abraham Walls Enns, Manitoba Colony's civic leader told Vice: 'That's all behind us now. We'd rather forget than have it be at the forefront of our minds. 'We only knew that something strange was happening in the night. 'But we didn't know who was doing it, so how could we stop it?' Offers of help from outside of the colony, including from more liberal Mennonite communities in Canada and elsewhere, were rejected. Orders for psychological help for victims has also never materialised. Old Colony Mennonites do not use motorised vehicles or electricity . Mennonites are Christians that can be traced from Protestant groups on Europe. They follow the teachings of 16th Century priest Menno Simons, who gave the group his name. There are about 1.7million Mennonites in 82 countries, with prominent communities in Canada, the U.S., Ethiopia, India, and parts of south and central America including Bolivia, Mexico and Paraguay. Almost 400,000 Mennonites live in the U.S. with more than 220,000 living in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The vast majority of Bolivia's Mennonite population are ultraconservative. Over the centuries, members have been severely persecuted and partially due to their pacifism Mennonites fled to other lands where they were tolerated. In the Old Colonies, motorised vehicles, electricity, dance and sport are all banned. Old Order Mennonites tend to use horse and buggies for transportation and speak in a German dialect.","In 2009, nine men in a Bolivian Mennonite community were jailed for raping at least 100 women and girls .

A Colorado mother accused in the heat stroke deaths of her two young children has been offered a plea deal, even though the victims’ relatives want to see the woman executed. Heather Jensen appeared in court Wednesday with a fresh perm and a smile on her face, waiving her right to a preliminary hearing so that she could consider a plea agreement offer put to her by the prosecution. The 25-year-old Palisade woman is charged with child abuse resulting in death, criminally negligent homicide and false reporting to authorities. Weigh in her options: Heather Jensen, 25, waived her right to a preliminary hearing, signaling to the prosecution that she may be interested in a plea deal . Serious charges: Jensen was arrested in January for allegedly causing the deaths of her toddler sons in November by leaving them in an overheated SUV for 90 minutes while she had sex in a truck . Tragedy: Two-year-old William (left) died on November 27 in Colorado while his four-year-old brother Tyler (right) died a week later in hospital. The two had been left by their mother in an SUV with the engine running for 90 minutes . The charges stem for a tragic November . incident in which Jensen allegedly left her two sons, 2-year-old . William and 4-year-old Tyler, locked in a car with the heat running for . more than an hour while she took drugs and had sex with a man in a truck . nearby . The younger of the two boys died of hyperthermia at the scene, while his older brother passed away at a hospital a week later. Call for justice: The victims' grandfather, Robert Mathena, said the family would have liked to see Jensen executed . Under a possible plea deal, the . details of which were not made public during the Wednesday hearing, . Jensen's charges could be reduced to two counts of criminally negligent . homicide carrying a sentence of 12 to 24 years in prison, according to . the boys' grandparents. 'They [the prosecutor and an . investigator] asked us what we would like to see done. Of course, we . said, ""The electric chair,""' the victims' step-grandfather, Robert . Mathena, told The Denver Post. 'But we would like to see this come to an end.' The death penalty is not an option for the 25-year-old Jensen based on her current charges. Mathena and his wife, Diane, have spent more than two months fighting the mother in court over the fate of her sons' remains. Tyler and Willem died just six week after the Mathenas' son and Jensen's husband, Eric, was killed in a car crash. The woman was planning to have her . boys cremated, but their grandparents won the right to lay them to rest . next to their father in Palisade. The toddlers were finally buried in . February, nearly four months after their deaths. Robert Mathena told CBS Denver he was outraged to . find a letter penned by Jensen in prison that was attached to the . heart-shaped headstone erected on the grave for the two boys and their . dad. Letter from prison: The dead boys' grandparents were shocked to discover a note from Jensen attached to their headstone stating that she was sorry, and that she was a 'good mommy' to them . The 25-year-old woman has been in . jail on a $150,000 bond since her arrest last winter, but the Mathenas . believe she had sent her letter to a friend who then brought it to the . cemetery. In her missive, Jensen wrote that she . was sorry, called her sons' deaths an accident and described herself as a . 'good mommy' who always tried to keep her kids from harm. The letter was supplemented by a birthday card for William, who would have turned three years old last Friday. Jensen is scheduled to be arraigned . May 30, at which time the details of the plea deal could be revealed, . should she choose to accept it. Speaking to CBS Denver, Robert Denver . said that he is tired of Jensen 'playing her little games' and wants her . out of their lives forever. But in an interview with The Daily . Sentinel, the grandfather pointed out that seeing the 25-year-old woman . walk away with three or four years of probation would not be acceptable . to the family. Widowed: Heather Jensen, 24, lost her 26-year-old husband Eric in a car accident last year . Devastating loss: The young mother lost both her sons in the tragic accident last year . Deadly: Heather Jensen dialed 911 on November 27 when she realized that her youngest son was not breathing in the back seat . 'I'd like to see her do some serious time,' he concluded. Law enforcement officials say the Palisade woman left her sons on November 27, 2012, in a parked SUV for 90 minutes . while she met up with a male friend in a car sitting next to her own. Mrs Jensen called 911 that night to say . two-year-old William was not breathing and had no pulse from the car . park close to Powderhorn Mountain ski resort in Grand Junction, . Colorado. She also told dispatchers at around 7pm that four-year-old Tyler was barely breathing. William died at the scene while Tyler was airlifted to Aurora's children's hospital but passed away a week later. Both children died from hyperthermia, according to the autopsy by Mesa County coroner. Hyperthermia is a condition which causes extreme overheating in the body.

And apparently it makes the face more attractive, too. For despite having kept an uncharacteristically low profile since leaving the X Factor judging panel in 2011, Cheryl Cole has been voted the celebrity most women want to look like. She has the most desirable eyes, hair, cheekbones and skin tone, according to a recent survey. And according to clinical psychologist Dr Linda Blair it is because she has been absent from television screens, while Victoria Beckham, who is rarely far from the media spotlight, was among the stars women least want to copy. Cheryl Cole seen here modelling for L'Oreal, has been voted the celebrity most women want to look like . Dr Blair said: 'If we see something all the time we also get bored with it, no matter how fascinating it is. 'So it's actually a really wise trick to not be in the spotlight all the time. Over-exposure is boring. Being slightly inaccessible is endearing and attractive.' Cheryl, who rose to fame after winning Popstars: The Rivals in 2002, was once named the sexiest woman in the world by FHM magazine. In this latest survey almost a quarter of women asked said they would like to have her thick auburn hair and large dark eyes. 11 per cent said they wished they had her golden skin tone and 10 per cent were keen to copy her nose. Miss . Cole, whose recent hiatus from the television might have pushed her out . of people's minds, was one of 15 British and American female . celebrities survey recipients were presented with. They . were asked by beauty brand Transformulas to select their favourite . features from stars ranging from Miss Cole, to Victoria Beckham, to . Angelina Jolie. Mrs Beckham didn't appear in the top three for any feature. Other . celebrities did, however, including Jennifer Aniston for her hair, . Keira Knightley for her cheekbones, and Eva Longaria for her skin tone. According to psychologists it is because the pop star has been away from our TV screens, and absence makes the heart grow fonder when it comes to admiring style . But the only feature Miss Cole was beaten on was her mouth. The survey found that American actress Angelina Jolie's smile is more popular. Explaining the psychology behind why Miss Cole's features are attractive, Dr Blair said: 'When it comes to attractiveness what we are looking for is someone who is not quite symmetrical. Perfect symmetry is boring, so you want it to be slightly off-beat. 'Also you are looking for some sign that that individual is interested in the world around them, and in particular about you. And that comes mainly in the eyes. Eyes that are dark, or that have large pupils, show interest. 'When we get interested in someone our pupils enlarge, we can't help it. And when we are interested in someone else they feel flattered so they think that you're more attractive. Over-exposure leads to boredom and Victoria Beckham (left) was among the stars women least want to copy. Angelina Jolie (right) was voted as having the best mouth, the only feature that Cheryl was beaten on . She added: 'We've been conditioned to think that darker skin is more beautiful because it's associated with the ability to take a holiday and get a tan. 'Normally you would go for really glowing skin and good colour which shows good blood flow and so the tan thing is something we've been conditioned to through advertising and things.' Miss Cole, was married to footballer Ashley Cole for four years until 2010, has undergone a glamorous make-over since breaking into the music industry 11 years ago. Her hair has got fuller, her teeth whiter, and her skin a deeper shade of tan. But her smile has remained the same and Dr Blair said that could be why she was beaten by Miss Jolie to top the best-mouth category. Dr Blair said: 'With the smile, if you show your teeth a whole lot that usually is a sign of appeasement, you don't feel quite confident. 'If it's a sort of gentle relaxed smile then that is very, very attractive because they're saying we're equals and I'm really engaged in you.'","Cheryl Cole has been voted the celebrity most women want to look like .

Gino D’Acampo may currently be Britain’s favourite Italian chef – a man who appears to be on TV almost every day – but it turns out his own family don’t think he’s up to much in the kitchen. This revelation becomes apparent when he returns to his Naples home as part of his first primetime TV show, Gino’s Italian Escape, and he’s shaking like a leaf as he makes salmon pasta and cherry tiramisu for his mother and close relatives. 'I can cook in front of millions of people on TV, I don’t care,' says Gino. 'But cooking for my own family really freaked me out. If they don’t like it, they tell you. They’re a bit too honest, they should lie a bit more. Back to his roots: Gino D'Acampo has returned to his native Italy for a new TV show out next month . 'My mum can’t believe I’m a TV chef in England. She says, ""I’m amazed, how did this happen when you’re so messy and not as good as me?"" I say, ""If you’re such a great cook, why don’t you have a cookery show?"" She doesn’t like that. She thinks I’m a bit too cocky...' Gino’s Italian Escape finds Gino, 37, taking a mouthwatering journey around southern Italy where he grew up, revealing the delicious secrets of the area’s traditional dishes and sourcing the ingredients that make them so special. He goes cherry-picking in Campania and gets to touch sacred 3,000-year-old olive trees in Puglia. 'They have microchips in them so that if anyone touches them it sends a satellite signal and the police will be there in ten minutes.' There’s even deep-fried pizza in Naples. 'At school we used to eat it and I’d forgotten the taste,' he recalls. 'It doesn’t taste deep-fried, it’s absolutely beautiful.' And it’s not just the food that takes centre stage in the show – Italy’s breathtaking scenery is one of the highlights. In one episode in the beautiful Puglian town of Alberobello he gets to cook on the roof  of one of its unique cone-shaped trulli houses. Basta! Gino (pictured with his mother - left - as a baby) says his family aren't impressed with his cooking skills . Tucking in: Gino gets to grips with some Italian classics - and finds some new favourites . 'That was a pretty special moment,' he says of the Unesco World Heritage Site, one of the country’s most striking tourist attractions. In Rome he even cooks outside the magnificent Colosseum after sourcing his ingredients at the central market. From there he heads to the Amalfi coast, and stops off at the resorts where he holidayed as a child to cook and meet the locals. 'My mum and dad used to take my sister and me there on camping and fishing holidays so it was great to revisit and tell the story of the area through food,' he recalls. And there were a few surprises in store, even for Gino. 'I never realised Amalfi lemons had no pips and were so sweet they could be eaten like apples. The skin is beautiful and spongy, not acidic like the ones that you get in Britain.' He believes the trip has only made him more passionate about what the Italians have, and what we in Britain lack. 'What’s special about Italy is the weather, and the fact that they have respect for their ingredients,' he says. 'In Britain you can’t grow beautiful tomatoes or courgettes and there is not so much respect for ingredients. We allow supermarkets to sell rubbish. We should all be saying, ""You know what? We’re not going to buy strawberries at Christmas because we don’t need to."" A key rule for every cook should be not to buy food when it’s out of season because it’s expensive and tastes awful.' 2,400...

He thinks we have a misplaced idea about what good Italian food is, and he hopes that by showing an Italian enjoying the best Italy has to offer he’ll give us a fresh understanding about this land of foodies. 'Very few Italian restaurants in Britain do a good job,' he says. 'They’re too scared to show you what real Italian food is like because they think you can’t handle it, so they dilute it. A lot of the sauces in Italian restaurants here don’t make sense. They’re non-existent in Italy.' The sauce he makes for the salmon to serve his mother is a fiery arrabiata. 'This dish has been completely forgotten because people believed chilli was too overpowering for salmon, but it isn’t. Similarly, real carbonara sauce doesn’t have cream and mushrooms like it does here.' All of this led Gino to open a pasta and sandwich bar in the City of London recently; his plan is to have 20 across the country  in the next few years. 'I was there a year and a half ago and I realised how much rubbish they sell. So I decided to open a proper  pasta bar – good carbs, real Italian ingredients. Everything’s fresh. We’re already cooking for 500 at lunchtime.' Gino’s love of food is in his genes. His grandfather was head chef at a restaurant in Naples and Gino used to leave school early to watch him at work. 'I wanted to be just like him,' he recalls. Gino started his own chef training when he was 13, but despite being fascinated with Britain as a boy he never imagined he’d end up here. Then love intervened. He met half-British half-Italian Jessica Morrison when he went to work in Sylvester Stallone’s Mambo King restaurant in Marbella when he was 18. Regular on the box: Gino with his TV show co-host Melanie Sykes . She was his first love and, after a brief split, he decided she was his only love and he followed her to Britain. 'I never tried to convince my wife to move to Italy,' he says. 'She wouldn’t have liked that.' He started working for a ready-meals company which led to his first TV break, as a guest on Good Food Live on UKTV Food. With his good looks, Italian charm and fabulous accent he was soon on every foodie show going, before ending up with a slot on This Morning. But it was his winning appearance on I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! in 2009 that made him our favourite adopted Italian. Home is a £1 million pad in Elstree in Hertfordshire, where he lives with Jessica and their two sons Luciano, 11, and Rocco, eight. His wife may do most of the cooking but he very much rules the roost the Italian way. 'Whenever we can we always eat together and everybody sits at the table,' he says. 'Everybody starts to eat when I sit down. Nobody gets up from the table until I do. I like to have the respect.' Maybe you should tell that to your mother, Gino!

Syrbrina Fulton spoke after juror B29 told Robin Roberts she feels she is carrying the death of Trayvon Martin on her back and is hurting just as much as his grieving mother. The juror, who is referred to only as Maddy, said that as a mother herself, she is having trouble eating and sleeping after acquitting the 29-year-old, and said she was sorry for letting Sybrina Fulton down. 'She thought no one cared about her son,' she told Robin Roberts. 'I do care, but I could not do anything about it. I feel like I let them down. 'I am carrying Trayvon Martin on my back. George Zimmerman is guilty of murder but I stand by the decision we made because of the law.'

That George Zimmerman literally got away with murder.' This afternoon she told a . National Urban League gathering in Philadelphia on Friday to use her tragedy to stop the same thing from happening to another child and she blamed Florida's ""Stand Your Ground"" law for allowing her son's killer to go free. The message, she said, is to use her son's story to prevent other children from dying the same way. 'My message to you is please use my story, please use my tragedy, please use my broken heart to say to yourself, ""We cannot let this happen to anybody else's child"".' The nursing assistant was the first juror to come out and show her face after speaking on Good Morning America. She said she is not being paid and has no book deal but she wanted to come forward to tell her story. The mother-of-eight also revealed she 'fought to the end' with the rest of the women as she initially believed he was guilty of second-degree murder and certainly manslaughter. But even though they all 'felt in their hearts he was guilty', the evidence - or lack thereof - meant they could not convict.

'[But] the law couldn't prove it. 'You can't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty. But we had to grab our hearts and put it aside and look at the evidence. 'That's where I felt confused, where if a person kills someone, then you get charged for it,' Maddy said. 'But as the law was read to me, if you have no proof that he killed him intentionally, you can't say he's guilty.' When asked by Roberts whether the case should have gone to trial, Maddy said, 'I don't think so.' 'I felt like this was a publicity stunt.

Police chief Sam Dotson has written to the Federal Aviation Administration for approval and hopes to be using drones in the Missouri state capital within the next year. Dotson believes the unmanned devices are a cost effective way to aid his officers, especially with police chases and monitoring large open air events. Citizens in St. Louis might soon have to get used to drones in their skies after the local police chef applied to use the unmanned flying devices . A police chase earlier this week involving a helicopter cost the force $2.5 million, while a police drone would cost between $80,000 and $300,000, depending on features. ‘To help keep officers safe, to help keep the community safe,’ Dotson told KSDK, explaining his reason for requesting drones. ‘For monitoring public space, things like the upcoming Fair St. Louis, baseball games for terrorist, suspicious activity.’ But concerns have been voiced by the American Civil Liberties Union of Eastern Missouri, which says there are too many unanswered questions without local laws in place to protect citizen's privacy. St. Louis Police Chef Sam Dotson says he wants to introduce drones as a money saving way to police chases and events in large open spaces . ‘This is a case where our technology has gotten far ahead of our laws and our ability to protect us from unwarranted government intrusion,’ ACLU executive director Jeffrey Mittman told KSDK. ‘What are we going to do with the information that we gather? Who will have access to it? How will we protect against improper access? How will we protect against hacking of the data?’ Dotson, who is expected to meet with ACLU officials on the matter, said the drones would be used in public spaces where there are already other types of surveillance cameras and so there is no expectation of privacy.

Liz Cheney has taken a stance against same-sex marriage despite having a sister who is gay married. Cheney’s sister Mary and longtime partner Heather Poe were legally married in Washington, DC in 2012 and even their former vice president father Dick Cheney supports his lesbian daughter’s right to marry. But in her senate race bid in ultra-conservative Wyoming, Liz Cheney has become the black sheep in her family on the hot button issue. Black sheep? Wyoming candidate for senate Liz Cheney (left) has announced her staunch opposition to gay marriage despite having a gay married sister, Mary Cheney (right) ‘I am not pro-gay marriage,’ Cheney said in a statement released by her campaign. Cheney announced her run for senate against incumbent Republican Senator Mike Enzi last month. Since then, she has accused the Enzi campaign of running ‘push poll,’ reports ABC News, one in which voters are asked ‘Are you aware that Liz Cheney supports abortion and aggressively promotes gay marriage?’ The Enzi campaign has categorically denied the claims, but Cheney has now pushed back with her unequivocal declaration. Partner: Liz's sister Mary wed her longtime partner Heather Poe (left) in 2012. They are pictured here at a memorial for victims of the 9/11 attacks . Departure: Even Liz's father Dick Cheney, seen here with Liz in 2011, supports gay marriage. 'My general view is freedom means freedom for everyone,' he said back in 2004 . ‘I believe the issue of marriage must be decided by the states,’ the statement continued, ‘and by the people in the states, not by judges and not even by legislators, but by the people themselves.’ This stance is also a slight departure for the candidate in regards to her high profile family. Since as far back as 2004, Dick Cheney has maintained a pro-gay marriage stance. ‘Lynne and I have a gay daughter, so it’s an issue our family is very familiar with,’ Cheney told an audience that included his daughter while stumping in Iowa in 2004. ‘With the respect to the question of relationships, my general view is freedom means freedom for everyone. People ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to.’ Push back? Liz Cheney claims her opponent Mike Enzi is conducting a push poll campaign that asks voters 'Are you aware that Liz Cheney supports abortion and aggressively promotes gay marriage?' He later added that the issue should be decided on a state-by-state basis. Liz Cheney attempted to turn the tables back on Enzi as her statement pushed past the abortion and gay marriage issues. ‘The people of Wyoming deserve an honest campaign,’ Cheney said. ‘They should not be subject to the kind of dirty tricks this push poll represents.’","'I am not pro same-sex marriage': The Republican candidate in Wyoming said Friday .

Hundreds gathered at Greenwood Memorial Terrace to farewell Delbert 'Shorty' Belton and pay their respects to a man whose courage defined him at all stages of his life. Uniformed soldiers joined the mourners and the Reverend Homer Todd told how Belton had fought bravely in the Battle of Okinawa only to be senselessly murdered by teenagers last week. Fallen soldier: With hundreds in attendance, Spokane veteran Delbert Belton was buried with full military honors during a public service in Spokane, Washington on Thursday .

Mourners heard how the diminutive Belton had faced war, the Great Depression, losing his wife and the challenges of old age with bravery and courage. According to NBC, at the funeral he was described 'as a man who was short of stature but full of life and generosity, a tinkerer who loved souping up cars in his project-cluttered garage, and an ""agile"" dancer who needed no coaxing to get out on the floor.' Reverend Todd said, 'There are a lot of gals that will miss having a partner at those events.' 'He was short, but full of vim and vinegar.' Dark past: Adams-Kinard was convicted of third-degree theft and fourth-degree assault in June . Adams-Kinard and Demetrius Glenn, who are both 16, have been charged with battering 88-year-old Battle of Okinawa veteran Belton to death with flashlights in his car outside the Fraternal Order of Eagles Lodge on Wednesday after a botched robbery. Both were charged as adults and both have previous convictions for assault and were caught on security cameras in the area at the time of the killing. Glenn gave himself up immediately to the police, but Adams-Kinard went on the run for four days and allegedly told friends during his time in hiding that the beating occurred because of a drug deal gone wrong. Police have said that they have a letter in their possession, written by Adams-Kinard to his mother, in which he claims that Belton was selling them crack cocaine. The letter said that after purchasing a 'zip of crack cocaine from Shorty,' the teens 'proceeded to sock him.' 'I took his wallet and another ounce . of crack from his pockets,' the letter said, according to the court . document. 'He was unconscious so I made sure he was still breathing, and . then I took off.' Police . have said that they seriously doubt Adams-Kinard's story and . spokeswoman, Monique Cotton said in a statement: 'We have no evidence to . support that.' Even . Glenn's lawyer, Christian Phelps, told NBC News that he was skeptical . and said, 'It doesn't seem plausible to me. I wouldn't put any stock in . it at this point.' Detained: Demetrius Glenn, left, confers with attorney Christian Phelps. He is charged with first degree murder and first degree robbery. He is being held on $2M bail and will be tried as an adult . High price: District Judge Richard Leland, said the brutality of the attack and vulnerability of the victim make the high bail proper. Glenn's, right, was set at $2 million . However, Phelps also pointed out that, 'there are no eyewitnesses and no forensic evidence that links either of the kids to the crime.' Yesterday, upon the apprehension of Adams-Kinard, police revealed the sickening brutality inflicted on the helpless 88-year-old victim. Attacked in his car on Wednesday in the parking lot of Fraternal Order of Eagles Lodge, Delbert Belton was found wedged between the two front seats of his car on Wednesday and was battered so badly he sustained brain damage and had lost too much blood to survive the violent attack. Kenan Adams-Kinard and Demetrius Glenn, both 16, are accused of battering the war hero to death with flashlights after he fought back during a robbery and according to Belton's daughter-in-law 'They just kept hitting and hitting him.' 'He was an 88-year-old man,' said Barbara Belton to NBC News. 'Even if they wanted his money and he didn't want to give it to them, they didn't need to do that. 'They did a horrendous thing and they need to pay the consequences.' Most wanted: Police say Adams-Kinard was arrested by Spokane Police on Monday morning after a four day man-hunt . 'He hung around with the wrong people and made the wrong choices,' Odell Kinard said of his nephew, Kenan Adams-Kinard. 'It's the summer and ain't nothing to do here.' Glenn's lawyer says he plans to plead not guilty for the murder of Delbert - who took a bullet in the Battle of Okinawa - who was clubbed to death with flashlights as he tried to stop an apparent robbery in a crime which has captured the attention of the nation. Police in Spokane said that Belton was in his car in the parking lot outside the Fraternal Order of Eagles Lodge when the attack occurred on Wednesday night. 'The motive for this attack was robbery,' said Spokane Police Chief Frank Straub to NBC News. 'Race was not a factor. Additionally, there was no gang activity that was associated with his incident,' he added, noting that many commentators had pointed to the fact that the teens were black and the victim was white. 'These are two young men who just spun out of control.' Glenn made an initial court appearance Monday afternoon. He is charged in Spokane County District Court with first-degree murder and first-degree robbery. The charges carry a potential life sentence. District Judge Richard Leland, presiding over a packed courtroom, said the brutality of the attack and vulnerability of the victim make the high bail proper. Glenn had turned himself in Thursday . night, the same day Delbert Belton died of his injuries. The slightly-built youth gave yes and no answers to questions from the judge but . otherwise said nothing. Defense . attorney Chris Phelps noted after the hearing that the case has gone . viral on the Internet, with many people expressing strong opinions. Watch Video Here: . Surrender: Glenn turned himself in to police custody through his lawyer . 'The evidence doesn't indicate what happened,' Phelps said, adding that witnesses only reported 'two kids running away.' Straub said it appeared that Belton fought back against his attackers, which may have increased the severity of his beating. Wanted: Police released images of two possible suspects . Suspect Number Two: Police caught the two teens who assaulted 88-year-old Delbert Belton outside the Eagles Lodge in North Spokane Wednesday night . ‘Our information is that the . individual fought back and that may have made this, you know, a worse . situation,’ said Spokane Police Chief Frank Straub in a Monday press . conference. Straub was quick to maintain Belton’s innocence in the matter. ‘I'm not being critical of Mr. Belton,’ he clarified. ‘We certainly encourage individuals to fight back, and he should have. But it shouldn't have happened to begin with.’ Devastated: Daughter-in-law Bobby Belton, pictured, told of her grief at the brutal killing . Tribute: Lill Duncan takes a photo of a memorial for Delbert Belton, the 88-year-old World War II veteran who was beaten to death, in Spokane . However, Odell Kinard expressed his shock at learning his nephew has been accused of killing a man. 'It really hurt to hear that,' he said to NBC News. 'He has to take responsibility,' he added. 'But the family is praying he gets 10 years or less.' Unusually, Straub spoke of the lives of the suspects in this brutal case and the impact this crime could have on them. 'It bothers me that a distinguished World War II veteran lost his life,' Straub said. 'But the lives of the young suspects are also likely ruined,' he said. 'He came close to losing his life in service to this country in Okinawa and then he gets killed needlessly in the parking lot while he’s waiting for a friend. That’s the tragedy of this thing,' Straub said of the victim. Tribute: Friends raised a drink to Delbert Benton in the bar he was murdered outside today . 'The second piece is two young men whose lives and the lives of their families are ruined by criminal activity.' Belton was born and raised in Spokane. He survived being shot in the leg in 1945 at Okinawa, one of the fiercest battles of the war, and went on to spend 33 years working for Kaiser Aluminum before retiring in 1982. Fond farewell: Pallbearers remove Delbert Belton's casket from a hearse during the graveside service . Belton was called Shorty by his friends because he was little more than five feet tall, his niece Pam Hansen said. A second memorial service for Belton will be held at his son's church on Friday. Reverend Todd spoke of Belton's character and his bravery even in his last moments. 'There is evidence on his knuckles that he was brave as he faced the overwhelming odds of those who robbed him of his money and his life,' Todd told the crowd of mourners gathered around his flag-draped casket.","A funeral with full military honors was given for Delbert 'Shorty' Belton today .

These stunning images prove there is more to bees than meets the eye - in a kaleidoscope of colours which spectacularly show off their hidden differences. The pictures, taken by the U.S. Geological Survey's Bee Inventory and Monitoring programme, show that bees' colours range from blue to green, that some have no stripes and that their shapes range from large bumblebees to those as small as a grain of rice. There are more than 4,000 bee species in North America alone, with 20,000 worldwide, and the programme has spent nearly 10 years capturing the insects and documenting them in stunning detail.

An 18-year-old beauty queen who had to give up her title after being arrested for throwing homemade bombs had her first court appearance today. Kendra McKenzie Gill, was charged with four second-degree felony counts of possession of an explosive device when she appeared in a Salt Lake City court. Three friends of the teenager, who gave up her Miss Riverton title and the $2,000 scholarship that went with it after her arrest, are also facing the same charges. Court date: Former Miss Riverton Kendra Gill, pictured in court today, is charged with throwing homemade bombs . Gill, along with Bryce Christopher Stone, Shanna Marie Smith and John Patrick Reagh, could face up to 15 years in prison, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. The friends are accused of throwing bombs made from household materials they bought at Wal-Mart at the homes and drives of their friends. They claim the devices, made from plastic bottles, toilet cleaner and aluminum foil, were part of a prank they were playing on other friends. Prosecutor Blake Nakamara told Fox 13: 'What we charged them with was something reflective of what they did. We didn’t feel the need, for instance, to put the gang enhancement and to charge everything we possibly could.' Friends of the teenagers' families however, believe the youngsters are being harshly punished for a childish prank in which no one was injured. Travis Reginek, one of Gill's neighbors, said: 'I think it’s just ridiculous. They should have had some community service, had some misdemeanor charge against them, a small $50 or $100 fine, let them go explain the importance of safety to elementary schools.' The former beauty queen has already expressed remorse for the prank, stepping down from her recently awarded title of Miss Riverton. Speaking with KSL-TV and the Desert News, Gill said: 'I just thought that it would be best for the city of Riverton and all the people affected by our decision and my choice to just step down and resign from my position and let someone else take it from here.' Scroll down for video . A 'stupid' mistake: Gill started crying as she explained her reasons for stepping down from her position . Kendra McKenzie Gill, 18-year-old Utah beauty contest winner, was arrested on felony charges for throwing bombs . Giving up her title: Gill said it took hard work to win the title of Miss Riverton, and the $2,000 scholarship that comes with it, so giving it all up was a difficult decision . All four teenagers have previously acknowledged they were throwing the homemade bombs 'to scare some of their other friends,' Unified Fire Authority investigator Steve Bowen said in a court affidavit. 'We don't really understand a clear reason for their behavior,' prosecutor Blake Nakamura said earlier this month. 'The reason we charged them is obviously, what they possessed was indeed explosives, and we're alleging they were throwing them near homes and at people, and therefore, had the potential to cause a great deal of harm.' For more videos, please go to KSL TV . Gill is charged with manufacturing home-made bombs which her and three other teenagers threw from a moving car and people and homes . Scene: The teens were found to have thrown the bombs at two residences, including that pictured, in Riverton . Gill called the act a 'stupid mistake' but that she and her friends never aimed the bombs at anyone. 'We didn’t think about what we were doing at the time,' she said. 'We didn’t know that it would get to this point. We meant for it to be a practical joke and never had any intentions to harm anyone at all.' No one was injured in the incident, but that didn't get the teenagers off the hook. 'They were throwing them at both property and people,' Unified Fire Authority Captain Clint Mecham told KUTV-TV. 'This goes well beyond a teenage prank.' 'They're very caustic, very nasty. So they can cause injury to somebody just if the chemicals get on somebody, much less the fragmentation of the shrapnel damage that can be caused,' Captain Mecham told the television station. 'They can very easily cause serious harm or even death.' Gill had just been crowned Miss Riverton and was supposed to go on to compete for the Miss Utah title before her arrest . On her side: Gill's attorney, left, thinks the charges are overkill. Her parents Michelle, second from right, and Gavin, right, defended their daughter's actions . Gill's attorney Wally Bugden thinks the charges are overkill and that her title of Miss Riverton is almost being held against her. 'You could say it's possible that the chemical could splash someone, but that certainly was not their intetion,' Bugden said. 'They weren't trying to harm anyone. They were playing a prank.' Gill was crowned Miss Riverton, topping a slate of nine beauty contestants earlier this summer in the Salt Lake City suburb. She showed off years of piano training with a Scott Joplin number and took home a $2,000 scholarship. It took a lot of hard work to win that title and scholarship, so giving it up was pretty difficult for Gill. 'I just (knew) … I would probably have to get it taken away from me, just because of the contract. So I’d rather have it be my decision now than to have someone take it from me,' she said. Her parents also weighed in on the . rebellious act. Her mother, Michelle Gill, said it was hard to get mad . at her daughter knowing that her intentions were good. One of Gill's friends claims they were throwing the bombs as a prank, however, authorities said someone could have been gravely injured by the explosives . Her father Gavin Gill said: 'I’m confident that the legal system will handle it correctly, and the people that understand the facts of what’s going on and the character of all four of the youngsters that are involved in this will see this and handle it appropriately.' Gill remains optimistic that the situation will be positive in the end. 'I do believe this whole thing is a way to help us grow and to learn from our mistakes and to move forward and just kind of get on with our lives.'","Kendra Gill stepped down from her position as Miss Riverton .

A cocktail glass-shaped satellite that could provide a third of the world's required energy by 2025 is being developed by Nasa. The design was created by Dr John Mankins who was commissioned by Nasa to explore the possibility of using solar panels in space to send energy to Earth. What Dr Mankins came up with was an incredible floating satellite named the SPS-ALPHA, or . Solar Power Satellite via Arbitrarily Large PHased Array. It looks like a cocktail glass floating in space, but the SPS-ALPHA machine might be might actually be the future of how we collect solar energy . In a recent interview with Becky Ferreria at Motherboard, Dr Mankins claimed that, depending on funding, SPS-ALPHA could be launched by as early as 2025. 'A single solar power satellite would deliver power to on the order of a third of humanity—not all at the same time, but any of that market could, in principle, be addressed,' he said. The technology would mean that energy would beamed down to Earth where power stations would pick it up and farm it out to customers. The system would be made up of thousands of . thin, curved mirror-like pieces which could move around to ensure that . they picked up as much sun as possible. The inside of the SPS-ALPHA would also be lined with photovaltic panels which convert the sun’s energy into microwaves. These microwaves would then be beamed down to Earth out of the bottom end of the ‘cocktail glass’. The system would be made up of thousands of thin, curved mirror-like pieces which could move around to ensure that they picked up as much sun as possible . Dr Mankins, who runs California-based firm Artemis Innovation Management Solutions, claims that the system would be much cheaper than some alternatives like a single array that could go around Earth. On the NASA website Dr Mankins writes the project is a ‘a novel, bio-mimetic approach to the challenge of space solar power’. ‘If successful, this project will make possible the construction . of huge platforms from tens of thousands of small elements that can . deliver remotely and affordably 10s to 1000s of megawatts using wireless . power transmission to markets on Earth and missions in space,' he said. Solar energy available in space is billions of times greater than we use on Earth and beaming it down has long been seen as the answer to our dwindling energy supplies. Last year researchers at Stratchclyde University tested equipment in space that could collect energy and transfer it back to earth through microwaves or lasers. As part of the project, researchers at Strathclyde University aim to produce a 'swarm' of satellites that could one day power whole cities . The project waspart of a NASA . Institute for Advanced Concepts (NIAC) study led by Dr Mankins. The . role of the team at the University of Strathclyde was to develop innovative solutions for the structural elements of the project. The researchers hope to eventually produce a 'swarm' of satellites that could one day power whole cities. Initially the tiny satellites wouldn't replace ordinary power grids - instead, they could swiftly resupply power to disaster areas or outlying districts that are difficult to reach. A 'receiver' on Earth would turn the precisely targeted microwave or laser beams into usable electricity. Dr Massimiliano Vasile, of the University of Strathclyde, said: ‘Space provides a fantastic source for collecting solar power and we have the advantage of being able to gather it regardless of the time of the day or indeed the weather conditions.'","SPS-ALPHA is being developed by former Nasa engineer John Mankins .

An outbreak of tree-killing beetles from China is threatening to wipe out thousands of acres of woodland, the Government has warned. Officials said Asian longhorn beetles have been spotted across the south of England – posing a ‘serious threat’ to trees and shrubs. It was thought the bugs were accidentally shipped to Britain in wood used to package goods imported from China. Officials said Asian longhorn beetles have been spotted across the south of England - posing a 'serious threat' to trees and shrubs . Conservationists have warned that thousands of plants – including under-threat ash and elm trees – will be at risk if the situation is not brought under control. The spotted black and white beetle, which has antennae twice the length of its body, infects trees during its breeding season in August and September. Officials fear thousands of the bugs could thrive in Britain’s mild, wet climate. Dr John Morgan, from the Forestry Commission’s Plant Health Service, said: ‘There are strict controls in place to protect the UK against these pests, but we need to back these up with reporting of suspected cases. ‘These beetles could threaten a wide range of our trees, and the public have a vital role to play in protecting them.’ The public was being urged to report sightings of the beetles. It was thought the bugs were accidentally shipped to Britain in wood used to package goods imported from China . Martin Ward, the UK Government’s Chief Plant Health Officer, said: 'Government plant health services cannot do this work alone, and we need the public to act as our eyes and ears in gardens, parks, woodlands and workplaces to help us spot threats quickly before they become a serious problem. 'The public can really help us at this time of year by looking out for these two potentially serious beetle pests. They thrive in climates similar to ours, and their establishment could result in losses of trees from a wide range of species.' The bugs, which are capable of flying for more than a mile at a time, were first spotted in Kent last year - leading to the felling of 2,116 trees in the county. The Government thought it had brought the problem under control until researchers recently discovered the bugs in neighbouring Sussex and in Hampshire. The Asian Longhorn and its cousin, the Citrus Longhorn, are native of China and the Korean peninsula.

'It is suspected that the original beetles might have emerged from wood packaging material which had been used to import slate from China to a site next to where the Kent outbreak was located,' a spokesman said. He added: 'Untreated wood packing is a known pathway for Asian Longhorn beetles, and all wood packaging material imported into the EU should be marked to show that it has been treated to reduce the risk of carrying quarantine pests. 'It is illegal to import wood into the UK which shows signs of the beetle.' Dr John Morgan, Head of the Forestry Commission’s Plant Health Service, backed calls for the public to report sightings of the beetles. He said: 'There are strict controls in place to protect the UK against accidental introductions of these pests, but we need to back these up with constant vigilance and reporting of suspected cases. 'These beetles could threaten a wide range of ornamental, fruit and woodland trees, and the public and trade have a vital role to play in protecting our trees.'

Starbucks plans to open its first cafe in Colombia next year - after exporting the country's coffee beans for more than 40 years. The world's biggest coffee chain says it will only serve locally-grown coffee and it hopes to open at least 50 cafes in cities across Colombia in the next five years, starting in the capital Bogota. The announcement by the Seattle based-firm coincided with protests by local coffee growers who are demanding the government provide more aid to counter low global prices and cheap imports hitting the world's biggest producer of washed arabica beans. Local trade: Starbucks has announced it will open 50 cafes in five years in Colombia using only locally sourced beans, such as those from this plantation, in Quindio, Colombia . New image: Starbucks said it would not undercut the country's farmer-owned Juan Valdez chain and it will probably charge a little more to create Starbucks 'home-from-home' lounge environment . As part of its Andean strategy, the cafe firm said it plans invest millions of dollars via aid to support local farmers in conflict-affected areas. 'We've had great success in Latin American and it's well overdue for us to open up in Colombia,' Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz said, adding that he hoped to open at least six stores in the first year. A military crackdown on drug-funded insurgent groups has made Colombia more attractive to foreign firms once fearful of investing in the nation when the conflict between Marxist FARC rebels and the government was at its height. In addition to opening stores, Starbucks said it would partner with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and invest a joint $3million in a plan to help 25,000 farmers in conflict-hit areas of Colombia increase coffee yields. Starbucks' new coffee shops will be run by a joint venture between Mexican restaurant firm Alsea, which operates more than 500 Starbucks stores in Latin America, and Colcafe, a subsidiary of Grupo Nutresa, the fourth-largest Colombian food company. A military crackdown on drug-funded insurgent groups has made Colombia more attractive to foreign firms. The military is attempting to rid the control of Marxist FARC guerrillas, right, in parts of the country . Colcafe helped Starbucks develop Via, its instant coffee product, launched in 2008. The Via manufacturing business, Starbucks' only roasting facility in Colombia, will be expanded to roast espresso blends and packaged coffee for sale in the country. 'We want to sell Colombian coffee in Colombia,' said Craig Russell, Starbucks' senior vice president of global coffee. The USAID-Starbucks program will be directed at farmers in Antioquia, Tolima, Huila and Cauca, rich coffee-growing areas where there is still a FARC presence. A major aim of the initiative is to reduce 'extreme poverty, which is still a reality for almost all of these small-scale coffee growers that have barely one hectare (2.5 acres) of land,' said USAID chief Raj Shah. Protest: Coffee farmers in Colombia have been protesting this last week outside the Coffee Growers Federation office in Medellin over low prices and lack of financial support . Farmers, truckers, and health workers have joined miners and some labour unions in protests for an array of demands that include reduced gasoline prices, increased subsidies, the cancellation of free trade agreements and the end of a crackdown on illegal mining . Starbucks said it would pledge funds to support 25,000 local farmers in conflict-affected parts of Colombia . Carlos Piedrahita, head of Nutresa, said Starbucks' entrance into Colombia's coffee shop market would mean investment and jobs. 'This means more demand for our national produce,' said Piedrahita, speaking at a press conference in Bogota alongside Schultz. Starbucks said its research suggests the cost of the chain's beverages, known for being relatively expensive around the world, won't deter consumers. The company declined to reveal its Colombia pricing, citing competitiveness. Schultz said Starbucks would not undercut the country's farmer-owned Juan Valdez chain and probably charge a little more to create Starbucks 'home-from-home' lounge environment. He emphasized the company wanted to make a 'respectful' entry into a country that has been a key coffee supplier for many years.","World's largest coffee chain plans to open 50 cafes over next five years .

Scientists have captured the remarkable moment a boa constrictor attacked a fully-grown howler monkey to claim it as a substantial snack. The incident, which took place deep in the Amazon rainforest in Western Brazil, is rare, as monkeys are usually adept at protecting themselves from predators. But the video shows the huge snake crushing the hapless monkey before swallowing it whole. The video has caused scientists to rethink how vulnerable primates can be to skilled predators like the boa constrictor, that usually stick to smaller meals like rodents and birds, LiveScience reported. Scroll down for video . Scientists have captured the harrowing moment a boa constrictor attacked a fully-grown howler monkey to claim it as a substantial snack. Here the female howler monkeys clings to a branch in a futile attempt to pull herself from the crushing jaws of the snake . Júlio César Bicca-Marques, a . researcher at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul, said the female Purús red howler monkey did not see the snake lying in wait in the tree. In the study, published in the journal Primates, Dr Bicca-Marques suggests snakes prey on more New World monkeys than was previously thought. Commenting on the study, Paul Garber, a primatologist at the University of Illinois said it is known that snakes, raptors and big cats do attack monkeys but filming macabre spectacle is very rare. The monkeys, which have good vision, usually defend themselves by living in groups and collectively keeping an eye out for threats. But the unfortunate monkey in the film broke away from her group of five in the Amazon jungle before meeting the snake. The boa constrictor reportedly struck at the monkey and swiftly wrapped it in a death-grip by coiling its muscular body around the monkey, which tried to free itself by gripping a tree, but was crushed. The snake lay in wait crouched in a tree while the female monkey broke away from her group. The boa constrictor struck the monkey before crushing it with its powerful muscles. Here, the dead monkey is being swallowed head-first by the snake . The snake's attack was typical, according to experts. It crouched in once place, camouflaged in the foliage to wait for its next meal. Boa constrictors are so patient they have been known to wait in one spot for around one month. The female monkey was followed by a companion who was unable to save her friend from the powerful snake, despite hitting it several times. Defeated, the healthy monkey retreated, leaving the boa constrictor to swallow her crushed friend head-first over a period of just over one hour. The video shows the snake using its muscles to swallow the bulky monkey, which is thought to weigh around six kilogrammes - and then a rather huge bulge in its belly. Primatologist Dr Garber believes the monkey might have avoided being eaten if it had of stayed with its group, adding: 'being a solitary monkey is definitely not a good thing'. The monkey-shaped bulge is clearly visible in the snake's stomach . Dr Bicca-Marques told LiveScience: 'According to observations on predation . attempts on howler monkeys made by other researchers, howlers often . don't do anything to defend the victim.' Dr Garber believes the monkey might have avoided being eaten if it had of stayed with its group, adding: 'being a solitary monkey is definitely not a good thing'. The researcher claims it is the first time that a terrifying attack of this type has been caught on camera, although recent studies have found more rare types of primate predation, including a leopard eating a chimpanzee.","Júlio César Bicca-Marques, a .

The project has given around a dozen vacant units a facelift. Broken windows and unused doors have been covered with scenes of buzzing businesses. Hundreds of thousands of visitors pass through the town of Bushmills to reach one of Northern Ireland's biggest attractions- the Giant's Causeway. Now, the village is becoming recognisable for highly detailed artwork and graphics that brighten up its main street. Director of environmental services for the local . council, Aidan McPeake said: 'Being a tourist village, there was . quite a lot of emphasis put on trying to bring about an uplift and see . could it be the catalyst for further economic development in the town. Appealing: Two of the shops that were given a full facelift are now no longer occupied, which is testament to the project's success .

'Two of the shops brightened up with art over the past year are no longer vacant. 'Obviously . locals would much rather see the properties filled and in use all the . time but this is definitely the next best option,' McPeake said. Artists Helene Byrne and Louie Winward have painted . windows and doors on to empty houses, with farmyard animals emerging from the shops. Spooky: Some of the paintings, such as the scary faces in these windows have a gothic look . Green, green grass of home: The Northern Irish government has spent £2million to tackle dereliction over the past two years. This artwork is fixed to a hoarding around a building site . Points of interest: Farmyard animals (left) are a recurring theme in the town's paintings. Some of the windows have been painted with detailed items (right) Smarten up: The image of sharp suits in this painting reflects the project's aim to make Bushmills more appealing . Walk on by: A painted pheasant looks out on Bushmill's busy main street . The scheme was set up by locals and supported by the council. The local distillery contributed to the fundraising effort. £30,000 were raised for the first stage of the project and the second phase was carried out using government funds. The Northern Ireland government has spent £2 million pounds to tackle dereliction over the past two years and stickers were applied to windows in areas near the luxury golf resort where G8 leaders met to give the impression that business was booming.

Some patients over 75 are six times more likely to have operations to remove cancer than those living in other areas where doctors have written them off because of their dates of birth. Age discrimination in the NHS has been illegal since last October and patients can take doctors, hospitals or GP organisations to court if they think they have been unfairly denied treatment. The elderly are being denied life-saving operations in a postcode lottery of age discrimination in the NHS, figures show . But figures uncovered by the Lib Dem MP Paul Burstow reveal patients’ chances of having surgery to remove tumours, hip and knee replacements and other vital procedures depend on where they live. Mr Burstow, a former health minister, and campaigners say the variations are so marked they can only be caused by age discrimination in some areas. The figures show that women aged 75 in Mid Devon are almost six times more likely to have surgery to remove breast cancer than those living  in Birmingham. There were 325 such operations per 100,000 in this age group in the Mid Devon Primary Care Trust last year, compared with just 52 in the Heart of Birmingham PCT. Similarly, patients over 75 in Dacorum, Hertfordshire, are 12 times more likely to get knee replacements than those in Brent, North London. The rates are 665 per 100,000 in this age group in Dacorum, but only 54 in Brent. Mr Burstow said: ‘These figures reveal a postcode lottery of age discrimination. In some parts of the country, life-saving surgery  is not being made available to older people. Figures uncovered by the Lib Dem MP Paul Burstow reveal patients' chances of having surgery to remove tumours, hip and knee replacements and other vital procedures depend on where they live . ‘If things don’t change thanks to the ban on age discrimination in the NHS, older people can take action to make sure they are not treated as second-class citizens. ‘The NHS should provide people of all ages with the best possible quality healthcare. Decisions on whether a person receives an operation should only ever be made on the basis of individual assessments and never because of a person’s date of birth.’ Michelle Mitchell, of the charity Age UK, said: ‘The clear implication of these figures is that many older people, particularly in certain areas of the country, still face unfair, discriminatory and potentially illegal practice in the NHS. ‘Everyone deserves fair access to medical care, yet older people’s health and even their lives are at risk if arbitrary decisions are made about their care based on their age rather than clinical need. We cannot allow healthcare to be a postcode lottery, with older people in some areas paying a high price. ‘The ban on age discrimination was an important step forward, but these figures show there is a lot further to go before every older person can be confident there’s a level playing field when it comes to their treatment on the NHS.’ The figures – which also compare the numbers of operations for bowel cancer, gallstones and hernias – suggest that the worst areas for age discrimination are Brent in North London, Bromley in Kent, Harrow, also in North London, and Sefton in Liverpool. The Mail has long called for improvements in the care of older patients as part of our Dignity for the Elderly campaign. As a result of last year’s amendment to the Equality Act making age discrimination illegal, patients can also take legal action if they believe they have been neglected or not treated with dignity or respect by nursing staff. Decisions on operations are normally made by consultants. In some cases, patients may be too frail for surgery or a general anaesthetic. But campaigners say doctors should always assess them face-to-face rather than just looking at the date of birth in their medical records.","Patients’ chances of having surgery to remove tumours, hip and knee replacements and other vital procedures depend on where they live .

The number of two-year-olds receiving free childcare will double as a government scheme is extended to working families on low incomes. From today, 130,000 youngsters - 20 per cent of two-year-olds - will be eligible for funding because their families qualify for Free School Meals or they are looked after by their local authority. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has revealed that next September, the number will rise to 260,000, or 40 per cent of the cohort. Parents who qualify will be able to claim up to 15 hours a week of free early education for their child . The scheme is being opened up to families that earn less than £16,910 a year and receive working tax credits. Children who have been adopted, are in care or have a disability or special educational needs will also benefit from next year. The Coalition is investing £534million in the scheme this year, rising to £760million in 2014/15. Parents who qualify will be able to claim up to 15 hours a week of free early education for their child. Mr Clegg will outline the overhaul in a speech today, stressing that the government is helping more children achieve a ‘brighter start in life’ He said: ‘All the evidence shows that if you take two children - two five-year-olds hanging up their coats next to each other on the first day of school - the poorer child will already be behind their better off classmate before a single lesson has been taught. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has revealed that next September, the number will rise to 260,000 . ‘Without this help, children suffer and the whole class suffers as teachers have to focus more of their efforts on children who are frustrated and left behind through no fault of their own. ‘I believe that every British family, whatever its structure, background and circumstances, should be able to get on in life.’ The free childcare entitlement for two-year-olds was announced in the 2010 spending review. From last September, ten trial areas including Blackpool, Cornwall, Greenwich, Kent, Lambeth and Newcastle introduced the scheme, benefiting almost 1,000 two-year-olds. Speaking at the time, Mr Clegg said that parents would be given the option to spread their free nursery place over two days, rather than three, and to use the free hours between 7am and 7pm rather than 8am to 6pm. This was intended to make it easier to fit the childcare around working lives. The Pre-school Learning Alliance yesterday welcomed the expansion but warned that the scheme would not achieve its goal of giving two-year-olds a good start in life without proper funding. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the alliance, said: ‘From taking part in the pilot scheme for two-year-olds, we are acutely aware that many of these young children from struggling families will have additional needs requiring specialist one-to-one help. ‘Indeed, from our experience, we estimate that the true cost of providing such care could be double the amount per place the government has allocated.’ He said that the early years sector ‘fully supported’ the government plans but was wary of getting involved because many child carers have provided free places at a loss under a similar scheme for three and four-year-olds. He added: ‘The free early years entitlement scheme for three and four-year-olds has been historically underfunded by successive governments. ‘We cannot afford such underfunding to continue indefinitely and trust that now the government is extending the scheme to this younger age group that the higher costs of providing care to these children will be recognised and fully met.’ Anand Shukla, chief executive of the Family and Childcare Trust, warned that nursery closures could impede the delivery of free childcare. He said: ‘We are concerned that loss of nursery provision in children’s centres is impacting on local authorities’ ability to find sufficient places for the offer.’ New research by the Family and Childcare Trust - to be published this month - indicates that a minimum of 108 nurseries across England have closed or were never commissioned as they were supposed to be . Mr Shukla added: ‘Cost savings have driven nursery closures and this approach reduces capacity in the system which will damage government hopes of meeting its targets for provision of childcare for two-year-olds.’","From today 20 per cent of two-year-olds will be eligible for funding .

'Epidemic': Chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee Keith Vaz said the think tank's results are 'shocking' Rampant drink and drug abuse makes Britain the ‘addiction capital of Europe’, a think-tank warned last night. The Centre for Social Justice said alcohol and drugs are now costing the nation a staggering £36billion a year, causing ‘family breakdown, crime, debt and worklessness’. The report, No Quick Fix, found the UK has Europe’s highest rate of addiction to hard drugs such as heroin – and a greater percentage of people who will try amphetamines, cocaine and ecstasy at some point in their lives. Its authors criticised David Cameron for promising to spend more on residential drug programmes, but actually funding up to ten years of methadone for tens of thousands of heroin addicts instead. The think-tank also warned that men’s dependence on booze in Britain is second in western Europe, and women’s is higher than anywhere else on the continent. One in four adults in England drink to harmful levels, and one in 20 are ‘dependent drinkers’, it says. The report condemns the Government’s failure to tackle cheap alcohol by abandoning its plan for minimum unit pricing – calling for a ‘treatment tax’  on alcohol that could fund rehabilitation centres for addicts. Christian Guy, director of the Centre for Social Justice, said: ‘While our addiction problem damages the economy, it is the human consequences that present the real tragedy. ‘Drug and alcohol abuse fuels poverty and deprivation, leading to family breakdown and child neglect, homelessness, crime and debt as well as long-term worklessness.’ He added: ‘From its impact on children to its consequences for pensioners, dependency destroys lives, wrecks families and blights communities.’ The study also raises serious concerns about the explosion in legal high abuse. It points out that 150 legal highs have emerged in the past three years, but struggling authorities have managed to ban just one in ten. It claims more young people have used legal highs in the UK than anywhere else in Europe – and says that a quarter of the continent’s legal high users are found in the UK. No quick fix: The report condemns the Government's failure to tackle cheap alcohol by abandoning its plan for minimum unit pricing . Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, spoke of his concern about a potential ‘epidemic’ in legal high abuse. He said: ‘Today’s report by the Centre for Social Justice on legal highs is truly shocking. ‘The current system of temporary banning orders simply cannot keep up with the market in new psychoactive substances. ‘We must take action now if we are to tackle what is fast on the way to becoming an epidemic.’","Centre for Scoial Justice said the addictions are causing family breakdown, crime and debt .

'Depraved': Paul Wilson, of Birmingham, was jailed for life in 2011 for twice raping a child in a nursery . A nursery teacher raped a girl of . three after authorities ignored ‘obvious’ warning signs that he was a . danger to children, a scathing report has found. Paul . Wilson, 23, was free to abuse the child despite staff repeatedly . warning Ofsted and the local council that he had developed a ‘special . relationship’ with her. A serious case review found that the little girl had been ‘failed by those responsible for caring for her’. Criminal . record checks were not carried out properly before he was given the job . at the Little Stars Nursery in Nechells, Birmingham, which his mother . used to manage. She left before he started. Nursery staff alerted authorities again and again to the fact that Wilson was developing a ‘special relationship’ with the girl. Wilson took a particular interest in the child, and was seen cuddling and rocking her for hours, refusing to leave her. Concerned . nursery staff told authorities he had been seen taking the child into . an adult toilet alone and, on one occasion, had been found alone with . her in the sleep area of the nursery, with the child hysterically . crying: ‘I want my mummy.’ Yet despite several warnings over 18 months, neither the council nor Ofsted launched a proper investigation. The . review was carried out by Birmingham’s Safeguarding Children Board. It . said the authorities had been so lax in dealing with the situation that . Wilson would almost certainly have got away with the abuse had he not . come to the attention of police separately when a 13-year-old girl . reported Wilson for grooming her online. When officers checked his mobile phone they discovered videos of two attacks on the toddler. Failures: A serious case review said staff at Little Stars nursery knew of concerns about Wilson's behaviour but failed to act . The . case is the latest in a series of catastrophic child protection . failures by the children’s services department of Labour-run  Birmingham . City Council, which has been rated ‘inadequate’ for the past four . years. High profile cases include that of seven-year-old Khyra Ishaq, who was starved to death in 2008. In May, the department was described as being in ‘utter chaos’ by members of its own watchdog. The . review found the council and Ofsted both missed ‘obvious pointers’ that . Wilson was a paedophile and ‘missed opportunities to intervene’. Their . inaction had ‘supported’ his offences, it said. Questions: The report said among the failings was a lack of supervision and poor management of the nursery (pictured) Wilson . started work at the nursery in 2008. In November the following year, a . few months after the toddler joined, a student teacher on placement at . the nursery reported Wilson to her college and the council for . ‘inappropriate behaviour’. No action was taken. Two further complaints were made over the following year, but again nothing was done. The . ‘manipulative’ Wilson was so confident he would not get caught he even . filed his own complaint about ‘safeguarding issues’ at the nursery. He . was not pursued about the allegations against him, it was suggested, . because he was a male teacher, and staff were anxious not to make him . feel singled out. Jailed: Wilson was originally sentenced to life with a minimum of 15 years but this was cut by 18 months following an appeal . Wilson . was eventually caught because of the bravery of the 13-year-old girl he . had groomed online, one of 22 other victims all aged between 12 and 16. Once . he had gained their trust, Wilson would get them to commit sexual acts . which he recorded on webcams before threatening to show the images to . their family if they spoke out. In . 2011 Wilson was jailed for life for raping the child, grooming 22 other . girls and for more than 40 offences related to grooming young girls on . the internet and distributing indecent images. The judge described him . as ‘chilling, vile and depraved’. Wilson, . who pleaded guilty, was originally sentenced to serve at least 15 years . of a life  sentence. But he has since had his minimum term reduced to . 13-and-a-half years to encourage other paedophiles to admit their . crimes. Jane Held, chairman . of the Safeguarding Children Board, said: ‘There were unfortunately a . number of weaknesses in the way that nursery was run and a number of . opportunities to intervene earlier and prevent the continuation of abuse . which were missed. ‘There . were obvious pointers that should have raised the alarm, yet both Ofsted . and the local authority failed to recognise them and respond . appropriately.’ No staff members at Birmingham City Council were sacked or disciplined after the case. A . council spokesman said it was ‘sorry’ about the failures, but added: . ‘The first responsibility must sit with the perpetrator and with the . nursery which had a responsibility for checking and supervising. ‘The council had a responsibility in terms of responding to reports of Paul Wilson’s behaviour rather than preventing it. ‘ . [The . council] fully acknowledges that a referral to us was not  followed . through and that this meant that Paul Wilson was able to continue . undetected for a longer period.’ An . Ofsted spokesman said: ‘We very much regret that our inspection regime . did not help to stop this dangerous and manipulative child abuser . sooner.’","Paul Wilson, then aged 21, jailed for life in 2011 for twice raping an infant .

Jailed: Forrest was told he had 'ignored the cardinal rule of teaching' The schoolgirl lover of jailed teacher Jeremy Forrest has been left ‘devastated’ after she was banned from making contact with him until she reaches adulthood. The girl, who was 15 when she fled to France with Forrest, vowed to wait for him ‘for ever’ when he was jailed in June and has made several attempts to contact him in prison. But now, as part of an ongoing serious case review, it has been decided there should be no contact between the couple until she is at least 18. The ruling was made by a team including social worker Sarah Spain, currently in a relationship with one of the investigating officers in the case, Graeme Pawson. The schoolgirl and the father of Forrest said the link raised questions over her impartiality. The girl is now unlikely to be able to visit, write to or talk to the former maths teacher until his expected release in 2015. Forrest’s father Jim, a retired IT director, said he felt it was inappropriate for the social worker to be making decisions about the case while in her current relationship. Mr Forrest, 60, who lives in Orpington, Kent, added: ‘It would seem fair and proper that a completely impartial and fresh view is taken.’ The ruling has left the girl, now 16, ‘devastated and distraught’ – and Forrest is said to be considering a legal challenge. A source close to the schoolgirl said: ‘She is devastated. She has been in tears and feels it is really unfair as at 16 she is now an adult and feels she should be able to make her own decisions. ‘She is also concerned that her social worker is in a relationship with an investigating officer from the case and thinks it could influence her opinion.’ Forrest, 31, who was married at the time of his affair with the schoolgirl, was jailed for five-and-a-half years after being convicted of abduction at Lewes Crown Court and admitting a further five counts of sexual activity with a child. The maths teacher at Bishop Bell School, Eastbourne, who had prompted an international police hunt after he and the teenager went on the run in France, was said by the judge in the case to have ‘ignored the cardinal rule of teaching’. Forrest, who taught maths at Bishop Bell CofE school in Eastbourne, prompted an international manhunt after he want on the run with the schoolgirl . His behaviour had subjected the girl’s family to ‘appalling  distress’ and driven a wedge between the girl and her family, the judge added. The girl wrote to Forrest’s parents to declare her love for their son and apologise for ‘any upset’. She has also written to the  governors of Lewes prison, East Sussex, where Forrest began  his sentence, and Ashfield, near Bristol, where he is currently detained, to try to get in touch with him and gain visitor rights. All her requests were rejected, however. An East Sussex County Council spokesman said: ‘The conditions which have been put in place are not the decision of any one individual but are the result  of a multi-agency approach with involvement at senior management level. ‘Our staff have acted appropriately and have followed strict safeguarding procedures. Our primary concern is, as it has been all along, the safety and well-being of this vulnerable teenager.’ They refused to comment on any  relationships the girl’s social worker may have. Lucy Duckworth, of child protection campaign group See Changes, felt the ban was entirely justified. She said: ‘It is extremely sensible and long overdue.’ Forrest’s solicitor, Phil Smith, said:  ‘We are exploring all options in relation to this.’","Ongoing serious case review rules couple can have no more contact .

To make matters worse, it has now been revealed that Lamar was paid a visit by two drug councelors just hours before he was charged with a DUI. TMZ reports that the counselors - who work with the National Basketball Players Association - contacted Lamar to offer help and he accepted. During the visit to Lamar and Khloe's house, TMZ report that he was very receptive with a source telling them 'it was very positive'.

It follows weeks of troubling allegations about drug abuse and serious marriage issues with his wife of four years. Reports claim he has been battling an addiction to 'Oxycontin and crack cocaine' for two years. He has also been accused of cheating with two different women while on the road as a basketball player. Loyal wife Khloe, who was pictured . looking downcast as she arrived at a LA gym on Thursday, is apparently . desperate to 'save' her husband from his alleged drug problems and work . through their marital woes. Something the matter? It's virtually unheard of for Kris Jenner to keep a low profile, but it seems Lamar's troubles may be playing on the momager's mind as she was seen arriving in Burbank on Thursday .

Henry Foner, pictured as a young boy, has published the heartbreaking postcards sent by his father before he was killed at Auschwitz . A grandfather has revealed the heartbreaking postcards his father sent him from Nazi Germany before he died in Auschwitz. Henry Foner, 81, was just six when his parents sent him to Britain to escape the growing persecution of Jews in 1938. His father Max sent him dozens of brightly coloured postcards filled with fatherly love that  Mr Foner has treasured for the last 75 years. Mr Foner has published the moving correspondence public for the first time in a book titled Postcards to a Little Boy. He said: 'I was one of the lucky ones - my father sent me away to save my life. 'I was very happy to receive postcards as a child. But it got harder the more I lost my ability to speak and read German. 'It was very frustrating for me, but I guess it must have been a terrible blow for my father - the knowledge that I was actually forgetting him. My contact with my father broke at the end of 1942. 'At that time, a letter from the Red Cross arrived with my father’s last message before he was sent to Auschwitz - and then there were no more letters.' Young Henry was sent to live with a family in Swansea, South Wales, as part of the Kindertransport -  the evacuation of 10,000 Jewish children to Britain before the outbreak of war. The first postcards to arrive were in German but later Max wrote in English because his son was already forgetting his mother tongue. After seven months of postcards they suddenly stopped arriving when the war made communication impossible. In . the final poignant postcard before war broke out, dated August 31, . 1939, Max wrote: 'My dear little Henry! I'm glad that you are well and . happy. I hope war will not come.' Mr Foner has always kept the postcards sent by his father after he was sent to Wales as a child . Max addressed the postcards to 'My dear little Henry!' and in this one says he hopes his son is 'well and happy' In this poignant postcard sent shortly before Britain declared war on Germany, Max wrote to his son: 'I'm glad that you are well and happy. I hope war will not come.' He then signs it: 'With many regards for uncle and aunty and a lot of kisses, your Daddy.' In another postcard, dated August 2, 1939, he wrote: 'My dear little Henry! I hope you got my last letter and you are well and happy.' In different handwriting, Mr Foner's Aunty Liesel wrote 'Many greetings.' Max spent the early years of the war in hiding, dreaming he would one day be reunited with Henry, his only child. But he was eventually captured. The last direct communication Henry . had from his father was a letter sent through the German Red Cross in . August 1942, saying: 'I’m glad about your health and progress. 'Remain further healthy! Our destiny is uncertain. Write more frequently. Lots of kisses, Daddy.' Max was taken to Auschwitz four months later where he died in the gas chambers. In the first cards, Max wrote to his son in German and called him by his birth name of Heini . As his young son forgot his native tongue Max wrote in English and called him by his adoptive name of Henry . Mr Foner received the postcards for seven months before the war. He said if he could send one back to Max, it would read: 'Father, thank you for the kindness you showed me by sending me out of Germany' Mr Foner only discovered his father had died when the war was over - but it wasn’t until 20 years after the war that he received his father’s final 'farewell letter'. The letter addressed to a cousin explained: 'Please tell my son it was only out of deep love and concern for his future that I had to let him go. 'I miss him most painfully day by day and my life would lose all meaning if there were not at least the possibility of seeing him again someday.' And in a poignant thank you to his . son’s adoptive parents Morris and Winnie Foner in Swansea he said: . 'Please convey to them my deepest gratitude for making it possible for . my child to escape the fate that will soon overtake me.' Mr . Foner, who was born Heini Lichtwitz, was brought up by childless Jewish . couple Mr and Mrs Foner who raised him as their own, although he always . referred to them as Uncle Morris and Auntie Winnie. Mr Foner, now an 81-year-old grandfather living in Israel, has always treasured the postcards . In this card, Max wrote: 'I got your letter today and was very happy that you got the Easter eggs. There was very beautiful weather here today. Were you in the garden? Many greetings and kisses, your dad' Max faithfully sent cards to his son until the outbreak of the Second World War made it impossible . He later joined the RAF and served in Egypt before getting a chemistry doctorate from Leeds University and moving to Israel with his wife. Mr Foner said if he could send his father one last postcard it would read: 'Father, thank you for the kindness you showed me by sending me out of Germany. 'I would really like him to meet our family here - his family, actually - and see everything we’ve managed to accomplish, despite everything.' Postcards to a Little Boy was put together and published by Yad Vashem, the world center for documentation, research, education and commemoration of the Holocaust, in Jerusalem.","Henry Foner was sent postcards from his father after he was sent to Wales .

But the forests could be about to return, thanks to changing global temperatures, according to research at the University of Montreal, which suggests the freezing temperatures may mellow just enough to see the return of the ancient forests which once surrounded this icy area.

The peaks of Mount Kilimanjaro, the world's highest free-standing mountain, may soon be ice free, scientists warn. Between 1912 and 2011, the mass of ice on the summit of the 19,341ft dormant stratovolcano in Tanzania decreased by more than 85 per cent, say researchers with Nasa's Earth Observatory. Kimberly Casey, a glaciologist based at the U.S. space agency's Goddard Space Flight Centre, who visited the mountain earlier this year, also noticed Kilimanjaro's north ice field had separated. Shrinking: The ice fields of Kilimanjaro as pictured by the Advanced Land Imager on NASA's Earth Observing-1 satellite. In 100 years the mountain the amount of ice on the mountain has decreased by 85 per cent . The glacier had been developing a hole since the Seventies, but this is the first year in which it had been seen to divide in two. 'We were able to walk on land — or we could have even ridden a bicycle — directly through the rift,' Dr Casey said. Scientists now warn it’s no longer a question of whether Kilimanjaro's ice will disappear, but when. Estimates vary, but several scientists predict it will be gone by 2060. The views from the top of Mount Kilimanjaro are as surreal as they are spectacular. After ascending through multiple ecosystems — including cropland, lush rainforest, alpine desert, and a virtual dead zone near the summit — climbers can find themselves peering down on a thick blanket of clouds below that seems to stretch endlessly in the distance. But in the immediate foreground, ice dominates the view. Looking north, a shelf-like block of ice with a sharp vertical cliff sits on an otherwise featureless, sand-covered plateau. In the other direction, a second ice field spills off the edge of the plateau, down the mountain’s southern face. Kilimanjaro's southern ice field: Despite Mount .

Despite Mount Kilimanjaro’s location in the tropics, the dry and cold air at the top of the mountain has sustained large quantities of ice for more than 10,000 years. At points, ice has completely surrounded the crater. Studies of ice core samples show that Kilimanjaro’s ice has persisted through multiple warm spells, droughts, and periods of abrupt climate change. Rising air temperatures due to global warming could be contributing to the ice loss, researchers say, but a number of other factors are just as important, if not more so. An increasingly dry regional atmosphere, for example, is starving the mountain of the fresh snow needed to sustain the ice fields. Drier air is also reducing cloud cover and allowing more solar energy to warm the ice surfaces. Dr Casey visited Kilimanjaro as part of a research expedition in September this year.","Kilimanjaro has sustained large quantities of ice for 10,000 years .

Earth is warmer today than it has been for most of the last 11,300 years, new research has shown. Scientists studied fossils recovered from 73 sites around the world to track global climate to the end of the last Ice Age. They found that for 70% to 80% of this period, which dates back to the start of the holocene era in which we now live, temperatures were cooler than they are now. Earth is warmer today than it has been for most of the last 11,300 years, new research has shown - and the team say the biggest change has been in the last 100 years since the start of the industrial age . Average global temperature over the last ~2,000 years. US scientists studied fossils recovered from 73 sites around the world to track global climate to the end of the last Ice Age - and found Earth is warmer today than it has been for most of the last 11,300 years . Lead researcher Dr Shaun Marcott, from Oregon State University in the US, said: 'We already knew that on a global scale, Earth is warmer today than it was over much of the past 2,000 years. 'Now we know that it is warmer than most of the past 11,300 years. 'This is of particular interest because the holocene spans the entire period of human civilisation.' The study, published in the journal Science, provides the first truly global view of climate at millennia timescales. Many previous temperature reconstructions have been based on regional data, according to co-author Professor Peter Clark, also from Oregon State University. 'When you just look at one part of the world, the temperature history can be affected by regional climate processes like El Nino or monsoon variations,' said Prof Clark. 'But when you combine the data from sites all around the world, you can average out those regional anomalies and get a clear sense of the Earth's global temperature history.' The research shows that over the past 5,000 years the Earth underwent an overall cooling of around 0.5C. An ice core taken from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide which was used in the study . But in just the last 100 years - since the start of the industrial age - it has warmed by the same amount. The biggest changes were in the northern hemisphere, where there is a greater density of human population. Climate models predict that by 2100 the global temperature could rise by another 1C - 6C depending on the level of greenhouse gas emissions. 'What is most troubling is that this warming will be significantly greater than at any time during the past 1,300 years,' said Professor Clark. The scientists point out that, because of its position relative to the Sun, the Earth should now be near the bottom of a long-term cooling trend. Yet this is clearly not the case. Candace Major, from the US National Science Foundation's Division of Ocean Sciences, which funded the research, said: 'The last century stands out as the anomaly in this record of global temperature since the end of the last Ice Age. 'This research shows that we've experienced almost the same range of temperature change since the beginning of the industrial revolution as over the previous 11,000 years of Earth history - but this change happened a lot more quickly.'","Scientists studied fossils recovered from 73 sites around the world to track global climate to the end of the last Ice Age .

Motor racing legend James Hunt would be ‘horrified’ by the way he is portrayed in a new film of his life, says the lover who shared his final years. The £100 million blockbuster Rush, which has its world premiere in London next week, focuses on Hunt’s time as a hard-drinking, womanising playboy, as well as his intense rivalry with Niki Lauda for the 1976 Formula 1 title. But Helen Dyson, to whom he proposed on the day before he died, said Hunt came to be embarrassed by those hedonistic days once he settled down. Settling down: James Hunt had left his hedonistic lifestyle behind him when he met Helen Dyson in 1988. She said he would be horrified by the portrayal of a hard-drinking womaniser in a new film about his life . She told The Mail on Sunday: ‘James would be horrified by that period of his life being the subject of a film. He used to refer to that time as “my seedy past”. It wasn’t a happy time for him, and he was so ashamed of it all.’ Now 47, Helen is speaking about their relationship for the first time as she feels her part in Hunt’s life story has been ignored. ‘To some people I don’t exist,’ she said. ‘It feels like history has been rewritten, and I’ve been airbrushed out. It hurts. The James I knew was a totally different person to the one the public will see in the film. He was kind, gentle and sensitive.’ Snubbed: Ms Dyson, now 47, said she feels like some people have tried to rewrite history to erase her role in Mr Rush's life . Helen, a highly successful artist, was also left with nothing when he died and was forced to leave the house they shared because the often-chaotic Hunt had not got around to updating his will. She met Hunt in 1988, soon after his split from second wife Sarah, which was to become a particularly acrimonious divorce. Helen met James at a restaurant where she was a waitress. She was 22 and studying textiles at college in North London. He was 40. By 1991, she had moved into his sprawling Wimbledon home. Over the years, James mentioned his hopes of marrying Helen and starting a family many times. ‘It just wasn’t on my radar at that time,’ she says. ‘By 1993, though, we both knew it was going to happen.’ In June of that year, Helen took a holiday to Greece with her best friend. ‘It was supposed to be a last girls’ holiday before both of us started trying for a baby. In five years, James and I had never really been away from each other. We spoke every day and during our last call, he proposed to me again.’ The following day, Helen received a call from one of James’s closest friends to tell her he had died, suddenly, from a heart attack. It was 1993 and he was just 45. ‘I was 27 and I thought my life was all mapped out. Now my future, all my dreams, everything, were gone. I got home and just painted like a madwoman. Painting was my lifeline. He was planning to change the will, but he hadn’t got round to it yet. It didn’t seem urgent. ‘James knew I didn’t like the age difference between us, so he’d always say, “Don’t worry darling, I’m going to outlive you.” We really believed that was true, because he was so healthy,’ she says. Split: Mr Hunt with his second wife Sarah and son Tom in 1985. The two had an acrimonious divorce that cast a shadow over the domestic bliss he had established with his girlfriend . James’s house was sold, and Helen had to move back in with her parents. ‘It was then that what had happened started hitting home,’ she says. As the film is due to be screened, Helen . is too diplomatic to comment on James and Sarah’s divorce, saying only . that she loved spending time with Tom and Freddie, his two sons by . Sarah. ‘I was in my element with them, giving them art classes and . taking them for walks with the dogs.’ Ashamed: Ms Dyson said James Hunt would be embarrassed by the way he is portrayed in 'Rush'- a new blockbuster starring Chris Hemsworth as the F1 driver and Olivia Wilde as his first wife Suzy . But The Mail on Sunday understands, from separate sources, that during the split Sarah accused her former husband of being mentally unstable and an unfit father whose elder son did not wish to see him. At the time, Hunt said the battle was causing emotional trauma for his whole family – himself, Sarah, and Tom and Freddie. The case was still ongoing when Hunt died. The divorce cast a shadow over the domestic bliss he had established with Helen in suburban Wimbledon, South-West London, after he gave up drinking and smoking. In 1988 – the same year he met Helen – he had bought a house for Sarah and the boys and began paying regular maintenance. But the following year, Sarah . enlisted lawyer Fiona Shackleton, who was to become famous for her work . for Princess Diana and Paul McCartney, to fight for more. In 1991, the divorce was finally settled in court, with James ordered . to pay Sarah a lump sum of £45,000, maintenance of £2,500 per month, the . fees for the children’s school and nanny, and indemnity costs of . £172,000. By the end of that year, the pair were back in court after James failed to pay all he was required to. He . said he couldn’t afford to pay as he was ‘broke’,  with most of his . money tied up in insurance policies – and described himself as a ‘victim . of the punitive divorce system and greedy lawyers’.

The claims are further twists in a . mystery which has sparked huge speculation on the Internet as to whether . the ‘confession’ was actually true.

Mr Johnson told MailOnline: ‘The . sister was pretty web savvy and she said she didn’t know what her . brother had been doing and that she had never known anybody to OD. ‘She said she didn’t want to be in the middle of all her brother’s silly Internet games.’ Mr Johnson posted the information on . Reddit but was angry to learn he had been made the subject of a Shadow . Ban, which makes it look to other users like you have been banned, even . though everything looks normal to you. He believes the reason is that he was . posting personal information about Reddit users, which is against its . internal rules, so the moderators appear to have effectively suspended . his account. Mr Johnson said this left him in the . bizarre position that the only way he could investigate the story was to . write about it elsewhere, so posted a comment on Gawker about his . findings. The post which started the story was . put up on Reddit on Saturday night with the title 'Finally have the guts . to say it' to the AdviceAnimals subforum. The thread linked to the meme known . as Confession Bear, which usually reserved for innocuous confessions so, . within minutes, Reddit users began commenting on the photo, asking if . the disclosure was true and if so when it happened. In now-deleted comments, other users . began unearthing Naratto's personal details, which were publicly . available, including his full name, date of birth, occupation and . employer, location and Facebook, Twitter and Myspace account and then . began debating whether the authorities should be alerted. Reddit moderators then removed these details although MailOnline was able to find them still posted elsewhere on the Internet. They show that that the user, who . posted under the name Naratto, appears to be 24-years-old and originally . from Coquitlam, British Columbia, which is where he appears to be . living now. He says he is living in San Diego but this contrasts with what his sister claims. MailOnline carried out a search for him in San Diego using his personal information but no match came up. Naratto has either been in the Navy . or is still in the Navy and claims in an online profile on Help.com that . he is a Fire Controlman 2nd Class. Response: Naratto responded just once, pictured, to the stream of comments, which by Tuesday had reached more than 3224, claiming 'some' of the confession was true . Under his hobbies he lists ‘watching movies, smoking pot’, karate, claims to own a snake and says he used to be bipolar. His favorite film is the 2009 action . movie Rampage and his favorite song is ‘In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida’ by 1960s . rockers Iron Butterfly. In addition to being in the Navy, he . claims his other job is as a ‘Medicinal Marijuana Bud-Tender’ and in a . rambling post talks about how he set up a collective to sell it with his . mother. The post details how his mother fired . him because he ‘f***** up an order’ and asks other users to give him . advice on whether or not it is his fault. MailOnline has been unable as yet to . ascertain if this is true or not or if he was trolling and trying to get . a rise out of others. The post says: ‘When I asked what was wrong with it she had no answer for me and just told me I was fired. ‘When I told her that the shipment . arrived after I was off duty and it was the night shift’s . responsibility, she punched me in the face. At this point I lost my . temper and kicked a piece of furniture. I barely skuffed the surface, . the mark came out in a second with a paper towel and googone. ‘But that was the final nail in the . coffin of me working there. She said I was violent and impulsive… after . getting punched in the face and fired. I think I controlled myself . pretty well. I just want to know from an outside point of view if I was . wrong. ‘p.s. She kicked me out of the . building and told me to find my own ride home, since my car is broke and . she was my transport. I then had to walk for 5 miles in rain and cold . with just a thin undershirt (she had taken my work shirt since I was . fired). ‘Am I wrong in how I behaved? Was I . responsible for what the other staff had done? Someone please help me on . this cause I’m about to break down.’ Naratto has responded to the row and admitted that his confession was not entirely serious but would not elaborate. Lightening the mood: Trying to lighten the mood, he posted a follow up meme, pictured, suggesting the confession was a joke . 'First and only comment to be made by me,' he wrote. 'I posted this wondering what would . happen, there is SOME truth behind it, but I'm not saying what was true . and what wasn't. If I had a dollar for every time someone took me . seriously on the internet, I would be able to retire from today alone. I'm sorry to anyone that I've offended to the point of ruining their . lives. 'If you want to catch a murder, get . out of your house, put on some tight and go fight crime. I'm quite done . with reddit tonight. Back to the shadows of lurking, the world isn't . quite ready for me. When his personal information was posted on Reddit, Naratto put another post up. He wrote: 'EDIT: The reason for this . post and the admittance it was a joke because people started posting my . own personal information on there. Not s*** that was in my post history. 'Sure you can find information about . ME but link me to something that happened is completely different. I . made a meme about something, and it turned into people revealing my . PERSONAL INFORMATION. It was quite rude and VERY uncalled for.' He also posted a second meme stating: . 'If you joke about murder on Reddit without a throw away account you're . gonna have a bad time.' Fueling speculation that the . confession could be true, he then deleted his Reddit account, as well as . his Facebook and other social media pages.

The British grandmother facing a firing squad for smuggling drugs into Bali did not learn of her fate until eight hours after the decision was made public, in a message from one of her sons in England who had seen the news on TV. Lindsay Sandiford, 57, was told the Supreme Court had thrown out her final appeal. She told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The media found out at midday on Thursday, but I didn’t know until the evening. 'It beggars belief. The British consulate didn’t let me know. My lawyer didn’t tell me. Nobody thought to tell me.’ Lindsay Sandiford, 57, was told the Supreme Court had thrown out her final appeal. She told The Mail on Sunday: 'The media found out at midday on Thursday, but I didn¿t know until the evening' Sandiford, sentenced to death in January after being caught smuggling cocaine worth £1.6 million into Bali last year, has now exhausted the appeal process and can be spared by only a presidential pardon. In messages relayed from her prison cell in Bali’s Kerobokan jail, Sandiford said: ‘I was expecting the Supreme Court appeal to fail. Even so, it is very harsh for me to deal with. We’re all going to die, it’s just that I know it won’t be old age or illness that kills me. Mine will be legal murder. ‘I’m not sure if I’m frightened. I  just hope my death is painless. My biggest regret is for my family – my sister, my two sons and my baby granddaughter, who I will probably never have the chance to know.’ Asked how she coped with the prospect of the death penalty, she said: ‘It’s a weird feeling – like looking at myself from a  distance .  .  . sometimes I forget, and sometimes I feel very down. There are extremes of all emotions.’ Distraught: Lindsay Sandiford of Britain reacts . inside a holding cell after hearing her sentence to death . Sandiford’s death penalty has been heavily criticised by human rights advocates, including former Director of Public Prosecutions Lord Macdonald, who pointed out that  Sandiford insists she carried drugs only because of threats to the lives of her two sons. Three other Britons suspected of being higher up in the drug smuggling operation – Julian Ponder, Paul Beales and Rachel Dougall – were given sentences of six years, four years and one year respectively. Sandiford, of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, said she had been constantly taunted in jail by Ponder, who is serving his sentence in the same prison. He sneered at her when she walked past him with a prison official on Friday after learning her death penalty had been upheld, she said. The court told the grandmother she had shamed Bali's tourism reputation . by smuggling cocaine in the lining of her suitcase through the island's . international airport . But she added: ‘There is the other side where people have been incredibly kind in the most surprising and unlooked for ways. I’ve been very touched by the care I’ve had from strangers here and the generosity of the British public in funding my appeals.’ Well-wishers donated nearly £11,000 through a JustGiving appeal for Sandiford’s Supreme Court hearing after the British government refused funds.

David Hockney's ex-lover faces drugs charges after the death of a 23-year-old man at the artist’s seaside mansion. Dominic Elliott died from swallowing toxic toilet cleaner after a 24-hour drink and drugs binge with his boyfriend John Fitzherbert, who previously had a long relationship with Mr Hockney. The inquest into the death of Mr Elliott, who was Hockney’s studio assistant, yesterday heard details of an apparent ‘cover-up’ surrounding the tragedy. Friends: Renowned artist David Hockney (left) employed keen sportsman Dominic Elliott (right) as an assistant, who died after drinking bleach after 24-hours of partying with the artist's ex . Mr Fitzherbert, 48, admitted he had . phoned Mr Hockney’s chief assistant from hospital shortly after his . lover’s death to ask him to clear his bedroom of drugs to shield the . millionaire artist from ‘scandal’ because he was in poor health. The . assistant, Jean Pierre Goncalves De Lima, did as instructed, but when . police arrived at the house minutes later he told them ‘I’ve just done a . stupid thing’ and confessed to his actions. Death: Dominic Elliott, 23, had 'partied' on . alcohol, cocaine, ecstasy and cannabis with Hockney's ex John . Fitzherbert, 48, pictured outside the inquest . After . the inquest ended yesterday it emerged that Mr Fitzherbert is one of . two men who have been arrested and bailed for ‘drugs offences’ surrounding the incident in March. The . inquest heard how Mr Elliott and Mr Fitzherbert had ‘partied’ in the . house, drinking alcohol, taking cocaine and Ecstasy and smoking cannabis . before falling asleep in each other’s arms, just down the corridor from . the room where Mr Hockney was sleeping. Mr . Fitzherbert and the artist ended their relationship four years ago but . remained friends, with Mr Fitzherbert continuing to live in and run the . house in Bridlington, East Yorkshire. Mr . Fitzherbert then had a relationship with Mr Elliott. But Mr Elliott was . said to be competing for his attentions with Mark Shephard, another . household employee and school friend of Mr Elliot’s. Both men would . ‘ingratiate’ themselves with Mr Fitzherbert for ‘gifts’. Mr Shephard was . given a Land-Rover and taken to London by Mr Fitzherbert, making Mr . Elliott jealous, the Hull inquest heard. Coroner . Paul Marks recorded a verdict of misadventure and said he was satisfied . there were no suspicious circumstances or ‘third party involvement’ in . Mr Elliott’s death on March 17. He said there was no evidence Mr Elliott . intended to commit suicide, but that he was under the influence of . drugs at the time. Scene: Mr Elliott was taken to hospital from David Hockney's home (pictured) in Bridlington, East Yorkshire . Hockney painted this portrait of Dominic Elliott in 2008, left. Hockney's former partner John Fitzherbert, right, had taken illegal substances with Elliott and attempted to hide it, the inquest heard . Detective . Sergeant Thomas Napier was asked by the coroner about the ‘clear up’ of . drugs from Mr Fitzherbert’s bedroom to avoid ‘adverse publicity’. Admission: Jean Pierre Goncalves De Lima told police that he had been asked to hide drugs at the request of John Fitzherbert . Mr . Napier said: ‘A decision was made no one should be arrested in . connection with that. We felt it was more appropriate to investigate the . facts around Dominic’s death.’ But . outside court a police spokesman said two men aged 48 and 23 have been . arrested on suspicion of drugs offences and released on police bail . pending further inquiries. There were discrepancies between the evidence of Mr Fitzherbert and several other witnesses. Mr . Fitzherbert said Mr Elliott woke him at 4am to ask him to drive him to . hospital and never revealed what he had drunk. He said he saw the bottle . of toilet cleaner – with a 95 per cent sulphuric acid content – and . worked out what happened himself. But . a friend of Mr Elliott’s and several police officers told the inquest . Mr Fitzherbert said his lover had told him that he had drunk the . chemical cleaner before going to hospital. In . his evidence Mr Goncalves De Lima said he had been woken by a call to . his mobile from Mr Fitzherbert ‘in a bad state’ early on March 17. ‘He . told me, “Dominic is dead, Dominic is dead”. He asked me to go and clear . his room of any evidence of drug use.’ He confirmed he had cleared the bedroom as requested. Mr . Hockney said in a statement he had been unaware of the events. He said . he ‘greatly valued’ Mr Elliott’s work and was ‘devastated by his death’. Distraught: Dominic's mother Karen Kent (right) and Dominic sister's Beth and Poppy at Hull Coroner's Court .

The country's 10 biggest water companies are the biggest polluters of rivers and beaches, it was reported today. But despite the water companies being responsible for more than 1,000 pollution incidents since 2005, they have only been fined £3.5million. Incidents include sewage pumping into harbours and rivers and pollution killing fish and wildlife. Pollution: Many British beaches, including Blackpool, failed to meet the minimum water quality standards set by the EU last summer . Offences: The country's 10 biggest water companies were responsible for more than 1,000 pollution incidents since 2005, including into rivers and streams . According to the data, obtained by The Observer from the Environment Agency under the Freedom of Information Act, only around a third of incidents led to a fine, with companies being cautioned for the others. The average fine was £10,800 - a pittance in comparison with the £10.5billion customers paid the water companies in 2010-11. An Environment Agency spokesman said pollution could have a 'devastating effect on rivers, beaches, land, wildlife and, in the worst cases, communities'. MPs are concerned the penalties for pollution are . too small to encourage the water companies to act to prevent it. Joan Walley MP, chair of the Environmental Audit Committee, told The Observer: 'In law, the ""polluter pays"" principle is supposed to deter companies . from damaging the environment, but in this case the penalties appear to . be so pitiful that water companies seem to be accepting them as the . price of doing business.' While Simon Hughes MP, deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, told the newspaper: 'These figures are another indictment of the failings of our privatised . water companies in England. Many of them make large profits, pay huge . dividends, increase prices and pay little tax. When, in addition, these . figures show they don't deliver clean water, the public is entitled to . say that our monopoly water providers are neither good corporate . citizens nor good stewards of our precious environmental assets.' The Sentencing Council for England and Wales proposed increasing fines depending on the size of the company earlier this year. Its consultation into the level of fines for water companies recommended setting the standard fine for deliberate instances of pollution at £750,000, with the option of changing it for £270,000 to £2million depending on the nature of the offence. Costs: Much of Britain's sewerage system is still based on Victorian infrastructure which takes millions of pounds to maintain . But water companies strongly denied they saw fines as a normal part of doing business. United Utilities was the most frequently punished company with 242 offences since 2005, including one fine of £200,000 for 22 incidents of sewage leaking into the River Keekle, in Cumbria. A spokesman for the company said: 'To claim that UU are content to continue to pay fines and accept . cautions, rather than improve our performance is completely inaccurate . and very damaging. In our case, the number of incidents is declining . overall. 'The number of occasions when we have been fined has dropped since 2005. The instances actually went down year-on-year, five years out of nine. So to suggest we ‘accept the fine and carry on’ is plainly absurd. 'We’re not denying we have very occasional problems, and every incident . of pollution is one too many for us. But the trend for UU has been one . of improvement.' Thames Water received the largest fines over the period - a total of £842,500 for 87 incidents. It said it was not in its interests to . simply accept fines and cautions and carry on regardless because the . cost of clearing up pollution - which is the responsibility of the water . companies - can be 'enormous'. Anglian . Water was the third most fined company, and its offences included one . incident where a works manager ordered the destruction and falsification . of records. Fines: Thams Water, whose Mogden sewage works site is pictured, was the most heavily fined company . Works: The water companies insist accepting pollution because of small fines is not in their interests as they have to pay for repair and clean-up costs . It said it recognised 'there is still more work to do' but added that within the next two years it will have spent £2.3billion on maintaining and upgrading infrastructure, including 40,000 miles of sewerage pipes. A spokesman for Water UK, which represents water companies, said: 'The water industry takes its responsibilities to the natural environment very seriously and any incident that has had a negative impact is deeply regrettable. 'We never want to see incidents of pollution. The significant environmental and social implications, in addition to the unpredictable burden on resources following an incident, mean it is in no one’s interest to pay fines and accept cautions. 'Water companies invest billions of pounds each year to safeguard the natural environment while providing people with high quality, healthy water to drink and healthy rivers, beaches and bathing waters to enjoy. 'While it’s widely accepted there is still room for improvement, there is clear evidence of progress in many areas with the number of pollution incidents reducing year-on-year and growing investment in a number of initiatives to protect and nurture the natural environment.' An Environment Agency worker treats the River Trent at Yoxhall, Staffordshire, after it was contaminated with untreated sewage and cyanide . A major river was polluted after poisonous cyanide it contaminated sewage treatment works. Thousands of fish were killed after part-treated sewage, with contained traces of the cyanide, leaked into the River Trent in Staffordshire. The incident began after cyanide entered a sewage treatment works in Stoke-on-Trent through the pipe network. It killed the bacteria used in the sewage treatment process with the result that partially-treated effluent was discharged into the river. This contained 'one part in a million' of cyanide as well as ammonia, said a spokesman for the Environment Agency following the incident three years ago. The public were warned to stay away from the river as officials tried to trace where the cyanide had come from.","Largest water companies responsible for 1,000 incidents since 2005 .

Attacked: Lt Col David Parkinson (right) was attacked by five intruders as he was sleeping beside his wife of 35 years, Sonja (left), in Kenya . Cowering behind a locked door of a safe room, she endured threatening screams of ‘I will kill you’ as five thugs tried to force their way in. Next door, her husband lay dying in a pool of his own blood. This is the harrowing scenario detailed by Sonja Parkinson in an official police report, seen exclusively by The Mail on Sunday, which reveals the moment burglars fatally attacked her husband, retired British Army officer David Parkinson, at their home in northern Kenya last Sunday. The first-hand account by Mrs Parkinson, 60, describes how the gang broke into their house in the Lolldaiga Hills in Nanyuki just before 1am and hacked her husband to death with a machete. ‘While already in my bed with my . husband, I heard voices of people asking for guns and money,’ she says . in the written statement. ‘I was surprised by the voices and two . flashlights. 'There . were no other lights in the house. Immediately they entered our bedroom, . they concentrated on my husband, David, asking for money and guns. 'The other thugs were busy looking for our valuable property, taking two iPads and one Toshiba laptop. ‘My . husband said, “I will give you money”, but one of the thugs who had a . machete cut my husband on the left hand and left him profusely bleeding . and lying down beside our bed dying.’ Mrs . Parkinson said the men then tied her hands behind her back and asked . her for the key to their safe. ‘I lured them to where the safe room is, . pretending that I was to show them the cash safe,’ she continued. ‘Luckily, . I got into the room, locked the door behind me and untied my hands . .  .  . The thugs banged on the door shouting “I will kill you” but they . were not able to enter the room because the safe room has a metal . door.’ The ordeal lasted 30 minutes before the intruders left, smashing through a rear bedroom door. It was only then that Mrs Parkinson left the safe room to find her husband dead on the couple’s bed. Kenyan police say that as well as being sliced with the machete, Lieut Col Parkinson was also shot in the leg. They believe that the resulting wounds resulted in him bleeding to death very quickly. Crime scene: David Parkinson's house in Nanyuki, Laikipia where robbers raided his home and killed him . Springwatch presenter Simon King last night paid tribute to Lieut Col Parkinson, who he had known for more than a decade through their work at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya. Mr King said that Lieut Col Parkinson’s death was ‘a loss to Kenya, a loss to the community and a loss to the world. He was, simply, a very good human being.’ Locals confirmed last night that Mrs Parkinson has moved back into the family home where the murder of her husband of 36 years took place, but has installed bars across all the windows and stationed ‘heavily armed guards’ around the building. The couple’s two daughters, Anna, 33, and Renate, 29, are also staying with her. Staying: Mrs Parkinson said she has no intention of leaving Kenya, where she lived with her husband for more than a decade . Despite her traumatic experience, Mrs Parkinson said she has no intention of leaving Kenya, where she lived with her husband for more than a decade following his retirement from the Army in 2003. In her statement to the police, she added: ‘We have a good relationship with all our neighbours.’ However, detectives now say that one man they are questioning is a neighbour of the pair. He was taken in after being identified by police sniffer dogs. While the police have still not charged the suspect, they were granted more time to question him in custody on Friday.

A cannibal cult leader calling himself Black Jesus, who slaughtered his 'Flower Girl' followers and drank their blood, has himself been murdered in the jungles of Papua New Guinea. In flowing robes, Stephen Tari, 40, a failed Bible student, once led 6,000 'disciples' through the mountainous regions of the country, but was accused of killing at least three young girls and, as their mothers were forced to watch, drinking their blood. Calling himself 'the true Christ', he was convicted of only rape three years ago - before the country brought in new laws that meant convicted killers and rapists could receive the death penalty - and was among 48 prisoners who broke out of jail six months ago. 'Black Jesus': Notorious cult leader Stephen Tari after he was captured in Papua New Guinea in 2007 . Since then he has been on the run . with a handful of faithful followers, but his bizarre life came to an . end when he was said to have murdered a village woman this week and . attempted to take the life of another. Surrounded by furious . villagers on Thursday, he is believed to have been beaten and hacked to . death, along with one of his henchmen in the remote village of Gal in . the northern province of Madang. A special investigation by the . Daily Mail six years ago heard from three women who said they had . witnessed Tari drinking their murdered daughters' blood in bizarre . sacrificial ceremonies in village huts as he led his followers through . the jungle. Because of the remote area where he was murdered, . police have not been able to establish whether he allegedly murdered a . woman because he had started up his former cult and needed more human . sacrifices. Madang provincial police commander Chief . Superintendent Sylvester Kalaut told the Post Courier newspaper that the . village where Tari met his death is several miles by foot along jungle . tracks from the nearest small town. Capture: The feared Tari was beaten by villagers and tied up before being handed over to the police in 2007 . 'We are sending police and a doctor to the village to ascertain the cause of death. 'The . village where he was based is a four hour walk and from advice and . given reports of the state of his body, he will have to be buried soon . after the post-mortem is conducted,' said Superintendent Kalaut. Followers: Tari gathered more than six thousand disciples with his preaching in the jungles (library image) The . police officer warned that other prisoners who remain on the run and . who might be associated with Tari should give themselves up. 'He . is now dead and this could be the fate of the others who are also on the . run from the authorities. I am warning and strongly urging those . escapees to surrender themselves to authorities.' At . the height of his infamy, Black Jesus wore long white robes as he stood . on a rock in a jungle clearing and preached his own kind of gospel to . his disciples. He told the crowds that they would receive gifts from . heaven if they followed him. But behind his preachings was evil . intent. Luring young females he called his Flower Girls into huts, he . cut their throats and consumed their blood, mothers testified later. One woman said she was ordered to drink her own daughter's blood on one occasion. Police . were unable to capture him, despite knowing where he was because of the . constant the presence of his large 'flock' - he was guarded by henchmen . who carried rifles, spears and bows and arrows. But villagers finally carried out a 'citizens' arrest' in 2007 and Tari was eventually jailed. Now, . it is village power once again that has brought an end to his warped . teachings. It is expected he will be buried near the small jungle . community where he was killed.","Stephen Tari among inmates who escaped while a guard changed shift .

A biker has been banned from the roads after pulling a wheelie for police cameras at 110mph. Businessman Michael Chester, 42, was ‘showing off’ as he overtook a car with his front wheel almost perpendicular with the tarmac, a court heard. A North Yorkshire Policeman was left ‘shocked and alarm’ as he recorded Chester doing the high-speed stunt. The father-of-two today pleaded guilty to dangerous driving on 7 July at Northallerton Magistrates’ Court. Bench . Chairwoman Jo Senior told him: 'Riding at 110mph on one wheel is . extremely serious and is a danger to yourself and other road users. 'Motorcyclist deaths are already too high - you could have made it one more on that day.' Magistrates . imposed a 20month disqualification, sentenced him to 12 weeks . imprisonment suspended for two years, ordered him to do 200 hours unpaid . work for the community and ordered him to pay £85 costs and a £80 . victim surcharge. Mrs Senior added: 'You came very close to going to prison today. I hope you know that?' Chester, of Holmfirth, West Yorks, rode at high speed on his Suzuki GSXR on the A63 near Sherburn-in-Elmet and pulled the wheelie for about 8 seconds. Danger: Michael Chester was filmed by police pulling a wheelie on his motorbike at 110mph on the A63 near Selby, North Yorkshire . Prosecutor Katie Varlow told the court . that at 12.15pm a North Yorkshire Police Safety Camera officer was on . duty inside a Traffic Crime Enforcement Vehicle parked on the southbound . A63 , near Sherburn-in-Elmet when he spotted Chester’s motorbike . travelling at high speed in the distance. It is a long, straight road with a 70mph speed limit, the weather and visibility was good. The road is popular with motorcyclists who tend to meet up at the well-known Squires Cafi. Mrs . Varlow said: 'The defendant was travelling at a high speed on only the . back wheel. The front wheel was high an almost at 90 degrees to the . road. Blurred: Michael Chester screams past a police video camera capturing his high-speed stunt riding on film for the court . 'It was travelling well in excess of the speed limit and the traffic officer recorded footage. 'The defendant overtook a vehicle on the off-side still travelling on the rear wheel and his speed was recorded at 110mph. 'The defendant has then caused the motorcycle to go back on both wheels, which caused some wobbling.' Chester pulled the wheelie for about 7-8 seconds and the traffic officer said he was ‘shocked and alarmed’ by what he saw. Mrs . Varlow said police located Chester at the Squires Cafi and he admitted . he had pulled the wheelie but claimed he didn’t think it was dangerous. Busted: Michael Chester was showing off and tipping speeds of 110mph on the A63 near Selby, North Yorkshire . The court heard Chester has two children aged 11 and seven and runs a garden equipment supply company with his partner. Mitigating David Tyrer said: 'He accepts his actions were foolish in the extreme and he accepts responsibility for that.' Chester has been riding motorbikes for more than 20 years and had only one endorsement on his licence, said his solicitor. 'It is not a situation where Mr Chester is a habitual offender and his driving record would suggest the opposite.

Growing numbers of motorists  are installing video cameras in their cars to protect themselves against being wrongly blamed for crashes – and to shop other drivers to police. So-called ‘dashcams’ record the view from the windscreen and are already used in police vehicles and lorries. Popular in other countries, the gadgets, which can cost up to £300, are starting to be used by British drivers in the hope of proving they were not at fault in the event of a collision. Scroll down for video . Catch a thief: 'Dashcams' to record the view from the windscreen are already used in police vehicles and can be bought commercially . Footage could even be used by motorway users to defend themselves against accusations of lane-hogging or tailgating. Clips from the cameras are being passed to police to help convict dangerous drivers and ‘crash-for-cash’ fraudsters, while some people upload dramatic near misses to YouTube. Some of the dashcams on the market are just a couple of inches long and can be powered by batteries or car lighter sockets. They record high-quality digital footage of the road ahead, even at night, and important clips can be saved on to memory cards before being transferred to computers. Ian Crowder, an insurance specialist at the AA, said dashcams provided ‘excellent protection’ against crash-for-cash scams. He added: ‘They can be very helpful in the event of an accident to work out who was involved and who was to blame. Footage could be useful to support an insurance claim. The insurance industry would consider them to be a good thing.’ Mr Crowder said they could also be used by drivers to show they were not lane-hogging or tailgating, offences that recently became punishable by a £100 fine and three penalty points. But he added: ‘We would not be very happy if people were using them for vigilante purposes.’ Insurer Adrian Flux has for the past year offered discounts of up to 15 per cent to drivers who have dashcams fitted. The company believes the devices encourage safer driving as well as establishing fault in accidents and protecting against scams, particularly when fraudsters deliberately brake in order to cause an innocent motorist to collide with their car, or invent extra passengers who were supposedly injured in a crash. General manager Gerry Bucke said: ‘Using an in-car camera can provide valuable evidence to insurers.’ Earlier this year video evidence from a lorry’s dashcam was used to help convict a gang who deliberately drove into the vehicle in an attempt to make a fraudulent insurance claim. In a separate case, a motorist was disqualified for 12 months because  of footage taken on a dashcam that showed him attempting a dangerous overtaking manoeuvre. The film was supplied by a member of the public to Police Witness, a firm set up by a former police chief and a businessman which advises clients how to persuade police to view videos of bad driving and also how to secure better insurance deals. Its records show that several motorists have been given penalty points and fines after footage of their bad driving was sent to police. Chairman Matt Stockdale said: ‘There are literally tens of thousands of people now recording their journeys in Britain.’","Drivers upload footage to YouTube to help catch thieves .

This is the BMW Interceptor, a police pursuit vehicle that can reach speeds of 155mph – meaning it could theoretically cover Gloucestershire’s 50 miles of motorway in under 20 minutes. But so far, the £30,000 hatchback has been used mostly to track down uninsured or stolen cars on the speed-restricted roads in the genteel towns and villages of the Cotswolds and surrounding areas. Scroll down for video . New kit: Gloucestershire Police's new £30,000 BMW Interceptor which can cover the county's 50 miles of motorway in under 20 minutes . The car is based on the BMW 1 Series available in showrooms but has been tweaked, enhanced and kitted out with cameras to make it fit for high-speed police work. For those in any doubt, the word ‘Interceptor’ is emblazoned across the front, back and sides. The vehicle currently cruising Gloucestershire is a prototype that is being shared among the country’s police forces before orders are invited. AA spokesman Paul Watters called it ‘jaw-dropping’ and warned that young drivers could see it as a challenge. Kitted out: The car is based on the BMW 1 Series but has been tweaked and enhanced and kitted out with cameras to make it fit for police work . Similar: The new Gloucestershire police car has drawn comparisons with an Interceptor car featured in the Mad Max films . Keeping the law: Mel Gibson pictured driving his Interceptor in the Mad max films . ‘I’m not sure what motorists would think if they saw that looming into view,’ he said. ‘Probably “slow down”. You almost expect a net to come out of the boot and tyre shredders out of the wheels. It’s menacing. I’ve never seen a real police car with “Interceptor” on it. Comparisons: A poster for the 1979 Mad Max film featuring the Interceptor car . 'I hope it wouldn’t prove a red rag to a bull and a challenge for some of the real tearaways who might try to take it on.’ The 1979 Mad Max movie starred Mel Gibson as a police officer in a post-apocalyptic future, and featured a blisteringly fast police car with ‘Interceptor’ written prominently across it. Posters featured Gibson and one of the Interceptor cars with the headline: ‘The last law in a world gone out of control. Pray that he’s out there somewhere.’ But police insist the Interceptor is a serious crime-busting tool – not a macho gimmick. A spokesman for Gloucestershire Police said: ‘We’re delighted with it. There is a lot of interest in it. This Interceptor is equipped with Automatic Number Plate Recognition. 'Officers can drive the car on any road in the county and scan licence plates with the special ANPR camera. ‘If the number plate reveals the car has a police marker on it, has been used in crimes previously or is uninsured, the officers can stop the vehicle and carry out a search.’ A BMW spokesman said: ‘It is equipped with a front-facing, rear-facing and an interior camera pointing at anyone sat in the rear of the vehicle. 'It continues recording after the vehicle ignition is turned off to capture essential post-incident footage.’ The high-visibility Interceptor on trial is based on the BMW 125d M Sport diesel sports hatch-back. However, police forces are also testing out an unmarked or ‘stealth’ version of the Interceptor based on the even more powerful M 135i petrol version which will be used for a combination of undercover operations and some low-profile traffic duties. The Interceptor has been created by the German car-maker’s specialist ‘BMW Authorities Department’ and has been designed to meet demand for fast but smaller police pursuit vehicles   which are not left trailing when suspects in tiny vehicles try to give them the slip by going down tight alleyways or between bollards. Special equipment fitted  includes hi-tech ‘evidential camera’ systems to catch speeding motorists, bad drivers, and criminal activity – as well as read the number-plate using Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology. It is also fitted with specialist sporty  ‘BMW Performance’ options including black kidney grilles and black wheels and streamlined styling. For police work BMW said the Interceptor is fitted with an emergency warning system designed for a ‘high local impact’  with additional blue lights and a siren system  featuring ‘enhanced penetration capabilities.’ The bright high-impact livery is  designed to ‘disrupt criminal behaviour. The Interceptor has now moved on to Nottinghamshire Police which has taken deliver  ahead of its own trials. Nottinghamshire Police said they will be displaying the car to the public at  Emergency Services Day at Newstead Abbey on Sunday between 10am and 4pm.","The £30,000 car is based on the BMW 1 Series available in showrooms .

John Simpson prides himself on controlling his emotions when he reports on the heartbreak of those caught up in the midst of war. But the veteran reporter had to fight back the tears as he recalled the day he ‘rejected’ his own mother – when he was just seven-years-old. Simpson, who had to choose which of his estranged parents to live with, revealed that his decision to stay with his father Roy caused a permanent and terrible rift between him and his late mother Joyce. Difficult: Veteran reporter had to fight back the tears as he recalled the day he ¿rejected¿ his own mother . Speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday, he said: ‘There was just this awful thing between us. There was my guilt at having rejected my mother and my mother’s guilt at having kind of left me. I did love her and she was a lovely woman, but there was this barrier which neither of us could break down.’ Simpson, now 69, reveals he then saw his mother only a handful of times – ‘perhaps half a dozen or more’ – before her death in 1983. The father-of-three’s family story is told in an emotionally charged edition of the TV programme Who Do You Think You Are? later this month.

And what I remember was standing on the doorstep with the two of them and with my mother already packed and prepared to go and to take me with her. ‘And my father standing there and saying, ‘‘Don’t you think we ought to ask the boy who he wants to go with?’’ And so I thought about it and for  better or worse I chose my father.’ Simpson says the split divided the family and effectively cut him off from his mother and her relatives.In a particularly poignant scene, he struggles to contain himself when he is shown photographs of his mother he has never seen before. He says: ‘Just seeing these pictures of my mother – very, very moving.’ Simpson said last night he had been determined not to cry on camera but the subject matter had proved too  difficult. He said: ‘I know there is a comedian who jokes that the programme is just middle-class people crying in libraries. ‘My wife had said to me, ‘‘Whatever you do, don’t cry,’’ but I do become emotional about my mother.’ The programme will be screened on BBC1 on September 25 at 9pm.","Veteran reporter recalled when he had to choose which parent to live with .

The historic drum box still  contains raffle tickets signed by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Geoffrey Howe, Norman Tebbitt and, it is believed, two of the people who died in  the explosion in 1984. The tombola was organised during the Conservative Party conference and Cabinet Ministers bought tickets, signed them and popped them into the revolving drum.

But the tickets were never drawn for in the early hours of the following morning – October 12   – an IRA bomb rocked the hotel, killing five people and injuring another 30. It is described by the show’s presenter Fiona Bruce as ‘being associated with probably the most daring attempt on the British  Government since the Gunpowder Plot and given that it is connected with such an important moment in our history, where democracy was nearly wiped out overnight, our experts believe it could be as valuable as £5,000’. The tombola was taken to the Roadshow in Eastbourne by Bob Guy, who bought it at a charity auction shortly after the bombing. ‘I was an apprentice chef at the Grand when I was 15 in 1962,’ said Mr Guy. ‘I remember that same tombola being used in the ballroom then. So when I had the chance, I bid £200 for it. The money went to a local hospital charity. It then spent decades in my loft.’ Mr Guy, 66, recently sifted through the tombola’s 5,000 tickets – ‘many people bought up to 20 tickets each’, he says – to identify the VIP signatures.

A man seeking to clear his name in a famous child molestation case has successfully petitioned a New York judge to release 25-year-old documents used in his prosecution. Lawyers working on behalf of Jesse Friedman, whose conviction was highlighted in the 2003 Oscar-nominated documentary 'Capturing the Friedmans,' want to review grand jury testimony and transcripts of witness interviews. 'Every aspect, every part, every piece of paper generated in the matter of People V. Friedman' will be released to Jesse Friedman's defense team, state Supreme Court Judge F. Dana Winslow ordered following a brief hearing. Scroll down for video . Convicted child molester Jesse Friedman, pictured with wife Lisabeth Walsh, speaks to reporters on Thursday after a judge ordered the release of documents relating to his 1988 prosecution . In 1988, Jesse Friedman, middle, and his father Arnold, right, were charged with hundreds of counts of sodomy, sexual abuse, and employing a minor in an obscene performance . He gave Nassau County prosecutors . until Tuesday to provide the defense team with grand jury testimony and . transcripts of witness interviews, stemming from the notorious case. The . prosecutors said they intend to appeal Winslow's order, they had . opposed the release, citing concerns about victims' privacy. 'After . more than two decades, several guilty pleas, a complete appeal process, . and a full and independent re-investigation, the victims in this case . deserve closure and privacy,' said Shams Tarek, a spokesman for District . Attorney Kathleen Rice. 'We . are disappointed by the decision and will absolutely be appealing and . expecting to prevail on behalf of the victims in a higher court.' Filmmaker Andrew Jarecki, second from right, speaks to reporters following a court hearing involving convicted child molester Jesse Friedman, standing to Jareck's right with his wife, Lisabeth Walsh. At left is Friedman's defense attorney, Ronald Kuby . In June the DA's office had issued a . 155-page report that reiterated that Friedman's original conviction in . 1988 had been proper and correct. Friedman . was just 19 years old when he and his father Arnold were jailed for allegedly molesting children who attended their after school . computer class in Great Neck, New York. Jesse Friedman served 13 years in prison and was released in 2001. Now married and living in Bridgeport, Connecticut, he has been trying for more than a decade to clear his name. The documentary about the Friedman’s case – and the inconsistencies in the . evidence against them – was released in 2002. Directed by Andrew . Jarecki, ‘Capturing the Friedmans’ was nominated for the Academy Award . for Documentary Feature in 2003. 'This ruling is an attempt to correct a fraudulent report that was based upon false information that the DA knew was fraudulent,' said Jarecki following Thursday's decision by Winslow. The Friedman case has drawn . comparisons to the 1980s California McMartin preschool scandal involving . allegations of sex abuse, but the investigators in their June report . said the two cases 'were in no way similar.' Winslow . on Thursday was particularly critical of a portion of the DA's report . that claimed Jesse Friedman, while in prison in 2000, had written . ""fictional"" stories that described violent and disturbing sexual acts, . including incest involving a father and his children, sex with a dog and . child rape. Jesse Friedman pictured in 1988, when he was 19 and then in 2004, three years after his release from prison after serving 13 years . Prosecutors also said he had been disciplined for possessing a photograph of 2 pre-pubescent girls - at least 1 of whom was naked - torn from the pages of a magazine in violation of the terms of his sex offender counseling program. Defense attorney Ronald Kuby has maintained that Friedman was acquitted of those prison charges; a claim that an assistant district attorney reluctantly confirmed Thursday. 'We can't function in the justice system in this fashion,' the judge said in a scathing rebuke. 'This is a country that has no feeling of credibility when it comes to our institutions.' Since . his release from prison in 2001, Friedman has been registered as a . Level 3 sex offender which continues to prevent him from leading a . normal life and prevents him from living near schools, playgrounds, . day-care centers, and houses of worship. The . nightmare for Jesse Friedman began in November 1987 after his father . Arnold received a child pornography magazine in the mail from the . Netherlands. Authorities were alerted and when they searched the Friedman home they found a stash of 20 magazines containing child porn. After learning that Arnold Friedman taught a computer class to children aged eight-to-10-year-old from his home, local police began to suspect him of abusing his students. Andrew Jarecki directed the film 'Capturing the Friedmans' and has spent the past 10 years working to help Jesse Friedman clear his name . Jesse helped his father run the computer classes and so he too became a suspect. Initially . detectives didn't find much evidence, but after some of the children . were interviewed as many as 15 times they began to speak out about . alleged abuse. Some children started to claim that Friedman had played bizarre sex games with them during their computer classes. Other . claims strained credibility, one student would have had to have been . molested an average of six times during every one of the 20 90-minute . classes they took if their allegation was true. However . with a witch-hunt brewing, Arnold and Jesse were charged with hundreds . of counts of sodomy, sexual abuse, and employing a minor in an obscene . performance. Initially they fought the charges, but as prosecutors added hundreds of new charges Arnold decided he had no choice but to plead guilty since the only physical evidence in the case was his collection of child porn. According to the family he confessed in the hopes that his son would be spared prison time. Police also accused Jesse's friend Ross Goldstein of joining the Friedmans' molestation. Faced with 118 charges against him, 17-year-old Goldstein admitting that he and Jesse had abused kids. In exchange for this testimony he was promised six months in jail and a cleansed record upon his release, but after testifying before the grand jury he was sentenced to two-to-six years in prison. Family torn apart by tragedy: . Arnold Friedman (father), Elaine Friedman (mother) and their three boys, Jesse (left) David (middle), and Seth (right) at David Friedman's bar mitzvah . Police searched Arnold Friedman's home and found his stash of 20 magazines containing child porn . Facing life in prison, Jesse decided he had no choice but to cut his own deal. Then aged 19 he pleaded guilty to sexually abusing 14 children in his father's home computer class and was sentenced to 18 years in prison. The court never heard from a witness or saw any evidence. Terrified . of what awaited him in prison as a child molester, Jesse undertook some . misguided damage-control. He gave an interview to Geraldo Rivera, . inventing a story of his own abuse at the hands of his father. Once in prison, Jesse reverted to maintaining his innocence - a position that led to being denied parole four times. He was eventually released from prison in 2001 after serving 13 years of his sentence, while he father committed suicide in prison in 1995 by taking a massive overdose of antidepressant. In 2004, Friedman’s lawyers filed a motion arguing that newly available evidence warranted reopening the case. Now married, to wife Lisbeth, and living in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Jesse Friedman hopes his case will inspire other victims of injustice . Successive courts rejected the appeal until . 2010, when a federal appeals court took the unusual step and urged . prosecutors to reopen the case, saying that Friedman may have been . wrongfully convicted. The decision cited 'overzealousness' by law enforcement officials swept up in the hysteria over child molestation in the 1980s. The ruling noted that 'the quality of the evidence was extraordinarily suspect.' Taken . together, the court said, 'the record here suggests ""a reasonable . likelihood"" that Jesse Friedman was wrongfully convicted.' The . DA's investigation took nearly three years to compile, but when it was released in June it wasn't the verdict that Friedman had been hoping for. The report not only affirmed . Friedman's conviction, but 'added critical context, and in some cases . supplied refuting evidence' to dis-spell theories put forward by Friedman and . his advocates. Unperturbed by the DA's report, Friedman and his lawyers have continued to fight and will be hoping that the release 25-year-old documents used in his prosecution all those years ago will provide hope. Since his release from prison in 2001, Jesse Friedman has sought to clear his name and have his name removed from the sex offender register .","A New York judge has agreed that Friedman's lawyers should have access to all documents used in his prosecution .

Sandusky is currently serving a 30 to 60 year prison term for raping and sexually abusing between 10 and 15 young boys. The correspondence between Sandusky and his pen pals has been obtained by the site TMZ, shedding light on his experience behind bars, which the  69-year-old described in one of the letters as 'very challenging.' In the handwritten missives sent by Sandusky from Greene State Correctional Institute in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania, he continued to present himself as a victim while noting that he is trying to ‘get better.’ The disgraced former Penn State coach called his conviction a ‘grave injustice’ and vowed to continue to battle the case 'until the last whistle.' In a letter dated May 19, Sandusky wrote to an unnamed friend that 'coaching at Penn State was an act of love and the many wonderful experiences have been a great reward in themselves.' Describing his time behind bars, Sandusky wrote, 'it is very challenging,' adding that he spends his days exercising, reading, mediating and doing a lot of writing, mostly about his case.

And with recent revelations that authorities can remotely enable the microphone on Android phones, mobile privacy concerns have risen to the top of the agenda. Now, Brooklyn-based designer Adam Harvey is hoping to cash in on these concerns with his $85 (£55) signal-blocking smartphone case named ‘OFF Pocket.’ The OFF Pocket blocks every signal your phone emits or receives- including 3G, 4G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS . The interior fabric is comprised of metal-covered fibres that shield your phone from signals of up to 100dB between 800MHz-2.4GHz. For comparison, various law-enforcement forensic bags offer 80dB of shielding . The OFF Pocket claims to block every signal your phone emits or receives- including 3G, 4G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS. To use it, you simply have to place your phone inside the case and close it. ‘Your phone is now OFF,’ claims Mr Harvey, adding that it is: ‘Untrackable. Unhackable. Undistractable.’ The interior fabric is made up of metal-covered fibres that shield your phone from signals of up to 100dB between 800MHz-2.4GHz. For comparison, various law-enforcement forensic bags offer 80dB of shielding. Most people are willing to take their mobile phone wherever they go. According to research by Morgan Stanley, 91 per cent of today people keep their mobile phone within 3 feet of them, 24 hours a day .

According to research by Morgan Stanley, 91 per cent of people keep their mobile phone within 3 feet of them, 24 hours a day. ‘I began working on the OFF Pocket in 2011 because I wanted more control over my privacy. Not just to protect my data, but also to unplug once in a while,’ said Mr Harvey. The OFF Pocket has been tested on all . major networks and is compatible with mobile phone hardware including . iPhones, Samsung, Motorola, Sony, BlackBerrys and Nokia. The accessory was initially designed as a . permanent pocket in a pair of shorts. However, the concept was too . difficult to get off the ground. The OFF Pocket was officially released earlier this year but the team is now hoping to place its first large production order funded through its Kickstarter campaign . The design team hopes to ship the first batch of cases towards the end of September . During the summer of last year, Mr Harvey met Johanna Bloomfield, a fashion designer and materials consultant living in New York. Over the next year, they collaborated on the project, made dozens of prototypes and subjected them to testing in the studio using diagnostic tools as well as various outdoor locations. The OFF Pocket was officially released earlier this year but the team is now hoping to place its first large production order funded through its Kickstarter campaign. ‘The OFF Pocket provides you with a physical barrier between your phone and the outside world, while Airplane Mode relies on a phone's software,’ said Mr Harvey. ‘Relying on software is never as safe as relying on a physical barrier.’ The design team hopes to ship the first batch of cases towards the end of September. Ever wondered who can find out where you are and discover what you’re doing by looking at your mobile data? The answer, according to security researcher, Brendan O’Connor, is just about anyone. That is, anyone, who has access to a Raspberry Pi Model A computer, a few over-the-counter sensors and a plastic box. With $57 (£37) Mr O’Connor managed to create a device, named ‘creepyDOL’, which can track the movement of everyone on the street. The sensors in the device looked at all the wireless traffic emitted by every nearby wireless device, including smartphones and tablets. He then connected each of the boxes to a command and control system, and constructed a data visualisation system to monitor what the sensors picked up. Mr O’Connor found that he could pick up the websites he browsed when he connected to a public Wi-Fi. ‘Actually it’s not hard,’ said Mr O’Connor in a New York Times interview. ‘It’s terrifyingly easy.’","Metal-covered fibres shield your mobile phone from signals of up to 100dB .
