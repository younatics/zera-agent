"By . Lucy Crossley . Posing up for fans' selfies is now a regular occurrence for many celebrities. But these Wimbledon-going stars got a bit more than they bargained for when they fell victim to a pair of pranksters who pretended to take a picture but were in fact filming the unknowing tennis fans. The ensuing footage from their awkward encounters has now been viewed by more than 300 people after it was uploaded to YouTube. Scroll down for video . Awkward encounter: A prankster from The Gatsby Club poses next to Rafael Nadal for what he thinks is a selfie during Wimbledon. The Spaniard is unaware he is  being filmed . Stunt: The pair also targeted Peter Andre during the tournament which ended on Sunday . Many of the stars, including Gossip Girl's Ed Westwick,  seem keen to get away asking 'what's going on?' while the pair tell them to 'wait for the flash', while others appear concerned the camera is not working. Sky Sports News presenter Roger Clarke can be heard to ask 'does it need a flash?' as the pranksters beam at the camera. But the pair were almost rumbled by presenter Ms Sykes who asked to see her photograph, and they confessed to Robson and X Factor's Chico that they were 'just messing', and had in fact been filming, much to the amusement of the celebrities involved. Pose: Footballer Scott Parker stares into the camera while the two 'fans' rest their arms on his shoulder . Jim Parsons, who plays Sheldon Cooper in The Big Bang Theory, tries to pull a smile as he looks into the lense, not knowing video footage of him is being recorded . Tiring of tricking the celebrities, the duo, who describe themselves on their YouTube page as 'Just 2 Regular Guys With a Passion to Make People Laugh', then turned their attention to unsuspecting members of the public. They approached tennis fans, this time pretending to mistake them for stars including actresses Anne Hathaway, Kristen Stewart and Zooey Deschanel, to ask for a selfie, before repeating the trick. Many of the targets were happy to play along, giggling as they waited for their pictures to be taken.

The day before Stefan Zeestraten was killed in a car crash – he was making furniture in preparation for his daughter’s arrival in three weeks but now his partner, Gemma Nicholson, must face parenthood for the first time alone. Heartfelt tributes are flowing on a memorial Facebook page dedicated to the 24-year-old New Zealand dairy farmer with many expressing condolences to his devastated partner of four years.

Mr Jackson said although it was unknown what caused the crash, his family and friends could guarantee it was not an alcohol – related incident. ‘One thing you can speculate is that it was because of black ice, it was one of the best frosts in Southland this winter that night, but there was no way alcohol was involved because Stefan wasn't drinking because he felt that crook,’ he said. He described the successful farm manager, whose family emigrated to New Zealand almost 17 years ago from Holland, as mature beyond his years. ‘He never had a bad thing to say about anyone. Even if we tried to think of anything negative about Stefan, we can't, he's just one of those guys who is that perfect,’ he said.

"By . Lucy Crossley . Record-breaking musical Cats is to get a modern makeover complete with a rapping 'street cat' when it returns to the West End later this year. The musical, inspired by the poems in TS Eliot’s book Old Possum’s Book Of Practical Cats, closed in London on its 21st birthday in 2002, making it the fourth longest running show in the West End. Now, after a 12 year absence Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical is to return with a strictly limited 12 week run at the London Palladium. Scroll down for video . Making memories: Record-breaking musical Cats is to get a modern makeover complete with a rapping 'street cat' when it returns to the West End later this year . Welcome return: Director Trevor Nunn, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and choreographer Gillian Lynne will all return for the new production . However, those hoping to relive their memories of the original show may be in for a surprise with Lloyd Webber revealing that the character of Rum Tum Tugger would become a rapping 'street cat' in the new version. The composer said he was 'never very happy' with some parts of the show including the Rum Tum Tugger song, adding: 'I’ve come to the conclusion that having read Eliot again, maybe Eliot was the inventor of rap'. He said: 'The thing about the Eliot verse is that you can tell he’s American, nobody other than Eliot would have written ""The Rum Tum Tugger is a curious cat"".' Changes: Lloyd Webber says he was 'never very happy' with some parts of the show including the Rum Tum Tugger song . The way they were: How the characters in Cats appeared during the original run . Performance: Bonnie Langford, Elaine Paige and Finola Hughes in the original West End show . The revamped show will run at the London Palladium from December 6, reunites Lloyd Webber with the original team behind Cats including director Trevor Nunn and choreographer Gillian Lynne. His previous show Stephen Ward The Musical, which was inspired by the 1963 Profumo Scandal, ended in March this year after a run of less than six months but Lloyd Webber said there was nothing wrong in putting on a new version of one of his old shows. He said: 'I don’t think that is necessarily true because if you said that we wouldn’t have a lot of room for Shakespeare.' Starting out: Cameron Mackintosh (left) and Andrew Lloyd Webber (second right) with original cast members Elaine Paige, Brain Blessed and Wayne Sleep at the show's 1981 premiere . Old Home: The New London Theatre on Drury Lane, where Cats ran between 1981 and 2002 . Since its debut in 1981, Cats has been seen by more than 50 million people in more than 30 countries. The musical, which features songs including Memory and Macavity: The Mystery Cat, ran in the West End for 21 years and 18 years on Broadway, collecting handfuls of awards, including Best Musical at both the Laurence Olivier Awards and the Tony Awards. Lloyd Webber said there would be an announcement in September about casting, with would-be Grizabellas and Old Deuteronomys following in the footsteps of the original production's stars Elaine Paige and Brian Blessed. Memory: Elaine Paige as Grizabella . Inspired by Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats by T. S. Eliot, Cats tells the story of a tribe of cats called the Jellicles as they decide which cat should ascend to the Heaviside Layer and start a new life in what is called the 'Jellicle choice'. The cats explain to the audience that they are marking the Jellicle Ball, and that their leader Old Deuteronomy will choose one of their number to be reborn on the Heaviside Layer. As the cats, including Jenny Anydots, Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer, introduce themselves though song, the audience meets a shabby old cat Grizabella, who is shunned by the other Jellicles. After more songs focussing on many of the individual cats, Old Deuteronomy allows Grizabella to address the group and she is chosen to be the one to go to the Heaviside Layer. A large tire rises from the junk piles, carrying Grizabella and Old . Deuteronomy partway toward the sky; he then steps off so she can finish . the journey on her own. The songs were mostly Elliot's verse set to music, with the exception of the show's most famous piece, Memory, sung by Grizabella, which was written by Trevor Nunn. Set on an oversized junkyard without scene changes, the show is completely told through music with virtually no spoken dialogue in between the songs.","Musical to return to London for 12 week run 12 years after it closed in 2002 .

"By . Leesa Smith . A government bureaucrat is currently being paid an astounding $28,000 a month for a job that no longer exists. Louise Sylvan has been earning $300,000 a year since 2011 when she was appointed to the role of CEO of the Australian National Preventative Health Agency - which just shut down in June. The Daily Telegraph reports that the bureaucrat no longer has official duties but still receives a salary because the five-year contract she signed doesn’t expire until September 2016. Louise Sylvan is being paid $28,000 a month for a job that no longer exists as the CEO of the Australian National Preventative Health Agency . It is understood Ms Sylvan turned down a $200,000 redundancy package when it was announced that the agency was folding. However, Ms Sylvan is not breaking any laws by receiving a salary unless there is a change in legislation which could then end her five-year contract. The agency was formed by the then Kevin Rudd Labor government with more than 40 staff employed to provide grants and sponsor events that would help combat drinking and obesity, with a $5 million budget. But the current Abbott Liberal government axed the agency this year and placed some of its initiatives with other government departments. Ms Sylvan is said to have an office in a Department of Health building in Sydney where her total annual salary is $332,800 and her base wage is $242,950. A spokesman for Health minister Peter Dutton confirmed to the Daily Telegraph that the agency the agency was now defunct but wouldn't comment on Ms Sylvan's situation.

"By . Leesa Smith . Federation Square in Melbourne is moving up in the world – big time. Once voted as one of the world’s biggest eyesores, it has now catapulted into the top ten public squares across the globe. The $450 million building opened in 2002 to great controversy over the design and costs with many describing the architecture as simply ugly. Then to add insult to injury - the 20th century design was voted fifth on a list of the world’s ugliest buildings in 2009, alongside a library in Kosovo, a television tower in Prague and New Zealand's 1970s-era parliament building. But now the buzzy square, which has about 9 million visitors each year, has done a complete turn-around by coming in at sixth place in the top ten public squares around the world. Scroll down for video . Federation Square has gone from being one of the fifth biggest eyesores to being voted in at sixth place in the top ten  public squares in the world . The Naghsh-e Jahaan Square in Isfahan, Iran took out the top gong for the best public space which is lined with shops and cafes, a green area in the centre and the great Shah Mosque to the north of the square . University of Melbourne architecture professor Philip Goad said the aesthetics of a building became almost irrelevant when it came to choosing the best public spaces. ‘It’s not got much to do with the style of the buildings that surround it but the fact that it has actually provided Melbourne with a great place to bring people together,’ he said. ‘It actually has events non-stop so people enjoy it – it’s a great place to go in central Melbourne.’ Coming in either side of Federation Square was St Peter’s Square in the Vatican City in fifth spot and the Rynek Główny in Kraków, Poland ranking number 7. 1. Naghsh-e Jahaan Square, Isfahan, Iran . 2. Piazza del Campo, Siena, Italy . 3. Red Square, Moscow, Russia . 4. Trafalgar Square, London . 5. St Peter’s Square, Vatican City . 6. Federation Square, Melbourne . 7. Rynek Główny, Kraków, Poland . 8. Plaza de Armas, Cuzco, Peru . 9. Times Square, New York . 10. Tahrir Square, Cairo . Prof Goad said Federation Square was significant in terms of 20th century public spaces as many others selected for the top ten were designed hundreds of years earlier. ‘It feels like you’re in a piece of outback landscape with the tiny cobblestone from Western Australia which is unusual,’ he said. ‘That’s why people don’t understand it - you wouldn’t say cliffs and valleys in the Kimberly are ugly and it’s got that sense to it.' Other historical squares receiving a ranking are Piazza del Campo in Siena, Italy as the runner up and Red Square in Moscow rounding off the top three. Two massive global tourist attractions - London’s Trafalgar Square and New York’s Time Square - featured at fourth and the ninth place respectively. While the Plaza de Armas in Cuzco, Peru got a mention for eighth place, and Tahrir Square in Cairo completing the top ten public squares. Prof Goad said the list was an interesting cross section of public spaces throughout the centuries. ‘Fed Square is significant in terms of the last century because most others were taken from across hundreds of years,’ he said. ‘So I think they have tried to balanced and generous in their spread of across time.’ However, he did admit that there were slim pickings when it came to public squares on offer from the 20th century. 'They’ve tried to find a representative new square from the 20th century and it’s essentially one of the few,' he said. 'Most large public spaces were created more than 100 years ago so in actual fact that is a mark of how in the 20th century there were probably very few of these major public spaces.' Prof Goad described some of the architecture surrounding the most famous squares as 'second rate'. 'It's about the fact that there is a relief from the density of the city and a space to gather,' he said. Piazza del Campo, Siena, in Italy came in second place with the Tuscan red, shell-shaped medieval piazza that hosts a horse raise - the Palio di Siena - twice a year . Red Square in Moscow, which made it into the top three, is considered the city's central square and surrounded by significant buildings - St Basils, the Kremlin and Lenin's mausoleum . London's popular Trafalgar Square got the fourth spot: since its inception by the great British architect John Nash, the square has been a source of pride for all Brits and is a constant stage for art, culture and other events . Number 5: St Peter's Square is a plaza of huge proportions located directly in front of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican City, the papal enclave surrounded by Rome, directly west of the neighbourhood . Rynek Glówny in Kraków, Poland came in at number 7: the space is accessible to pedestrians from 13 different points and is one of the best car-free squares in Europe, as it is generally only accessible via foot . Placing eight in the top ten is Plaza de Armas, Cusco in Peru : As the centre of the ancient Inca capital, the plaza is richly layered with history from its foundation to the Spanish arcades that surround the square and the more modern formal layout with its hard and soft landscape acts as a healthy, beating heart to the city . The bright lights of Times Square comes in at number nine: the world's most buzzing square in the city that never sleeps has a constant stimuli making it an absolute 'eye-gasm' and complete sensory overload . Lucky last but not least goes toTahrir Square in Cairo: huge underground viaducts provides pedestrian accesses - it is filled to the brim with people suggesting its power as a site of solidarity and tool for protest .","Federation Square in Melbourne came in at sixth place in the top ten public squares across the world .

"By . Lucy Crossley . The son-in-law of a Monaco heiress shot dead as she left a hospital has withdrawn his confession to the killing, saying he did not understand 'all the nuances' of the French language. Wojciech Janowski, 64, last week confessed to playing a role in the shooting of Helene Pastor, the 77-year-old billionaire mother of his partner Sylvia Pastor, according to prosecutors. However, as Janowski appeared before a bail judge, his lawyer Erick Campana said that he had 'retracted his statements made while in custody' and 'denies having ordered' the killing. Withdrawn: Wojciech Janowski, 64, (left) has withdrawn his confession to killing Helene Pastor, 77, (right) saying he did not understand 'all the nuances' of the French language . Mr Campana said Janowski, who has served as Poland's honorary consul in Monaco, had 'misunderstood the meanings of the terms used by police and was speaking in French while he does not understand all the nuances of our language'. Mr Campana said he would demand that an appeal court nullify Janowski's detention - and the statements made while in custody - because he did not have access to a lawyer or interpreter during his 96 hours in custody. However, the judge ruled that Cambridge graduate Janowski must remain in custody pending trial. Janowski was arrested early last week by police on suspicion of 'masterminding' the killing of Mrs Pastor, who was shot multiple times with a sawn-off shotgun as she was leaving a hospital in the French Riviera city of Nice. Her driver, Mohammed Darwich, 64, also died from injuries sustained in attack on May 6. Probe: A police officer investigates a car at the site where Helene Pastor and her driver were shot . Questioned: Wojciech Janowski, hides his face as he leaves a police station in Nice, France, by car last week . Janowski was charged after prosecutors said he confessed to the contract killing, for which he allegedly spent some 250,000 euros (£198,000) to hire two alleged contract killers. The two men - a 31-year-old and a 24-year-old originally from the Comoros islands and living in Marseille's rough northern districts - were also apprehended last week and charged. Janowski's personal trainer was also charged with allegedly organising the murder and acting as a go-between with the killers. Prosecutors had alleged Janowski ordered the killing 'to lay his hands on the inheritance' due to Sylvia, Pastor's eldest daughter on her death. Sylvia was initially detained in the case but later released without charge. The two have been in a relationship for 28 years and have a teenage daughter. Couple: Janowski and Sylvia Pastor (right) have been in a relationship for 28 years and have a teenage daughter . Helene Pastor had inherited a huge real estate and construction business set up by her Italian grandfather Jean-Baptiste Pastor, a stone mason who moved to Monaco in 1880. As the sleepy principality on the French Riviera slowly grew into a playground for the world's rich and famous, the family's fortune skyrocketed. The real jackpot came in 1966 when Prince Rainier, whose fairytale wedding to Hollywood actress Grace Kelly helped catapult Monaco to international fame, gave permission to Helene Pastor's father Gildo to build high-rise buildings along the seafront. Janowski heads a Monaco nanotechnology firm and an oil business, and is involved in numerous charities in the principality. After he was charged, Poland announced it was stripping Janowski of his title of honorary consul 'because of the loss of the irreproachable reputation that is essential for this role'. It also noted that as an honorary official Janowski did not enjoy diplomatic immunity from criminal prosecution.","Helene Pastor was shot multiple times as she left a hospital in May .

"By . Leesa Smith . Elated NSW fans kicked off their long-awaited celebrations on Saturday night as the Waratahs beat New Zealand's Canterbury Crusaders with a last-minute penalty at ANZ Stadium in front of their home crowd. Bernard Foley scored the long-range three-point penalty to win the match 33-32 for the Waratahs to take out the Super Rugby Championships for the first time in 19 years. It was a case of third time lucky for the Blues, who have been losing finalists twice before. Just minutes after the final whistle, the thrilling win prompted fireworks to erupt over the Opera House. The final was an awesome treat for the almost 62,000 fans - a Super Rugby all-time record - and the biggest crowd for a NSW home game in more than a century.

There was complete disbelief from the Crusaders players after they lost in the final seconds . Waratah Jacques Potgieter revels in the victory on Saturday night . Blues fans were holding their breath as the Waratahs were on the brink of a third painful finals defeat when the team squandered an early 14-point lead. But Foley’s 23-point contribution from a conversion and seven penalties and a two-try effort from veteran centre and man of the match Adam Ashley-Cooper proved just enough to deny the seven-time champions from Christchurch. The Crusaders paid the ultimate price for flanker Richie McCaw's ruck infringement which paved the way for Foley to  kick the winning goal with just seconds left on the clock. The man of the moment - Foley - said he had been working on his long kicks and gave it everything to get the ball between the posts from near the halfway line. ‘You just step up and take responsibility when it occurs,’ he said. ‘ It’s a dream come true.’ Ashley-Cooper has waited 10 years and 125 games to snare his first finals victory. 'I’ve waited a long time for this,’ he said. ‘It doesn’t get much better. We got the simple things right and got the job done.’ ‘I’m absolutely stoked. The nerves are still running through me – its’ like I'm still playing the second half,’ he said after game. Waratahs captain Michael Cooper was elated straight after the match, describing the win as an 'awesome effort' by all 35 players over the past five weeks of the championship. 'I'm so proud and we are going to enjoy the celebrations and then regroup in the change rooms,' he said. ' I thought the goal went under and not over.' Cooper described the Crusaders as a 'class outfit'. 'We did a good job to beat a team like that,' he said.

"By . Lucy Crossley . Final hours of freedom: Rolf Harris was seen at his home in Bray, Berkshire, yesterday where he was believed to have been sorting out personal affairs before his sentencing on Friday . Shamed Rolf Harris spent his final hours of freedom sorting out his personal affairs on the penultimate day before he is due to be sentenced for a string of sex attacks. Earlier this week the 84-year-old was convicted of 12 counts of abusing young girls, one of whom was as young as seven or eight. He is due to be sentenced on Friday and could face a sentence of up to 24 years in jail - meaning he could die behind bars. Yesterday, the penultimate day before his sentencing hearing at Southwark Crown Court , the grey-haired entertainer was seen being escorted from his riverside family home by men and women . dressed in black believed to be legal advisors. He later returned with . just his driver and permanent security guard. Harris was smartly dressed in a grey suit, white shirt and multi-coloured tie as he walked from the front door of his flower-bedecked home in Bray, Berkshire. The artist and former entertainer who is on conditional bail ahead of his sentencing for sex crimes on Friday, was away from the house for just 20 minutes before returning sat in the back seat of a black Audi car. There was no sign of his frail wife Alwen or daughter Bindi although both were believed to be spending the last 48 hours with Harris before he is likely to be sent to a prison cell. Harris' appearance outside the pink petunia-clad front door of his £1.75million home was a rare sortie into the limelight because he has not been spotted at home for months. The Australian looked stern as he chatted to his friends and assistants. Bizarrely, he was not wearing cuff-links as his the cuffs of his shirt flapped around in the warm breeze.

"By . Leesa Smith . A newly-married couple were left stunned - and the bride in tears - when they were hit with a $4,000 bar bill after celebrating their wedding at Sydney's posh ARIA restaurant - despite agreeing beforehand that the tab must be capped at $1,500. Blake and Sam Howard were enjoying their dream day as they mingled with about 50 guests at the Opera House restaurant, owned by celebrity chef Matt Moran, on Friday. But their celebrations were ruined when they were handed the bill as they went to leave - and realised it was $2,500 more than they had agreed, not including a compulsory $800 charge for gratuities and a further $1,000 deposit. The couple said the monster tab put their dream honeymoon - a two-month trip around Europe and Africa - under threat because they had to max out their credit cards to settle up, despite generous donations from guests. Sam and Blake Howard had the best wedding day at ARIA restaurant until they were slapped with a $4,800 bar bill . The dreaded bill from Matt Moran's (pictured) restaurant for the drinks, gratuities and remainder of the deposit . ‘I was flabbergasted to say the least,’ Mr Howard, 29, told Daily Mail Australia just hours after the nuptials. ‘I told them they would have to take the clothes off my back because I have nothing to give them.’ 'I don't know what we would have done without the help of our family and friends.' Mr Howard said he and his new wife had held two meetings with ARIA staff in the lead-up to their big day during which it was agreed that the couple would cap the bar bill at $1,500. ‘I told them to tap me on the shoulder as the bill got to $1,500,’ he said. ‘But they said that we should have put it in writing. 'At no point did they claim any responsibility or offer to reduce the bill. I was right there - all they had to do was tap me on the shoulder.' The newly-named Mrs Howard said the situation was very disappointing considering the staff, who helped organise their wedding, were fully aware of their budget. 'They knew about our two-month holiday – we had a small intimate wedding for that reason,' she said. 'We chose ARIA out of every possible venue in Sydney.' Here comes the bride: Sam Howard (middle) had the perfect wedding day until they received the hefty bill . Feeling on top of the world - little did the couple know that the rug was going to be pulled from under their big day . Mr Blake said management showed no empathy whatsoever other than offering the couple a payment plan for the outrageous amount. ‘It literally went from the best day to the worst day of our lives,’ he said. 'They just played technicalities and nonsense. There was no culpability or partial blame.' The bride said she was in a complete state of disbelief when her new husband told her the devastating news. ‘I thought it would it was going to be a completely cruisy day – we were all having such a great time,’ she said. ‘It’s rare to get away with no issues – all we had was windy weather to contend with  - I would have been happy with torrential rain but this just took the cake.’ After many tears and tantrums, the couple were left with no choice but to pay the hefty bill thanks to the generous help of their family and friends. The newlyweds managed to pull themselves together and go out with their loved ones as originally planned . ‘I’ve calmed down now – I’m a little less tense,’ Mrs Howard said. ‘I’m not ashamed to say I was standing on Macquarie Street crying – I was ready to throw it in and go to bed at 4pm.’ 'I didn’t know how we were going to get up in the morning but the positivity has remained with the people around us.' With the couple's credit cards now at their limits, they are not sure how they are going to survive on their honeymoon beyond the first few weeks.

"By . Leesa Smith . The door is open for Australian Federal Police officers to carry weapons in Ukraine, but Foreign Minister Julie Bishop insists those heading to the MH17 crash site will not be armed. Ukraine's parliament on Thursday voted overwhelmingly in support of giving Dutch and Australian officers the legal authority to lead the forensic investigation at the crash site. Ms Bishop said the vote had given the Dutch and Australian police teams an 'insurance policy' by allowing them to carry weapons. Julie Bishop (right), with former Ukrainian PM Yulia Tymoshneko (left), said Australian police officers will carry weapons in the Ukraine as an 'insurance policy' 'If necessary - only if necessary - both the Dutch and the Australian personnel can bring arms into the country,' she told reporters in Kiev. 'But we are not taking arms onto the site. Our convoy will not be armed. It's a police-led humanitarian mission.' Ms Bishop thanked the Ukrainian government for recalling its parliament for the vote.'This is what we've been waiting for,' she said. Ukraine's backing means Australia can use expert equipment and resources such as sniffer dogs in their investigation when they eventually gain access to the crash site. Ms Bishop said the armed Australian federal police officers (pictured arriving in the Netherlands) will lead a 'humanitarian mission' but the weapons will not be taken onto the MH17 crash site . Investigators were forced to abandon their mission for a fourth consecutive day on Wednesday because of clashes close to the site where the Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down, killing all 298 people on board, including up to 39 Australian citizens and residents. Ms Bishop has been offered assurances by Ukraine that a ceasefire can be struck so forensic teams can reach the site, where it's understood about 80 bodies remain. It's hoped this further breakthrough with Ukraine's parliament will allow a full convoy of investigators to access the crash site and begin work safely by Friday. Ms Bishop said Australia was determined to access the site so the remaining bodies could be collected with ""some dignity"" and returned to grieving families.","Ukraine's parliament voted in support of giving Dutch and Australian officers the legal authority to lead investigation at MH17 site on Thursday .

Queensland police are hunting for the man, described as in his 40s, who is believed to have been placing rocks and logs in dangerous spots om the Nerang State Forest. Police released a comfit image of a man who is missing his front teeth and has been spotted acting suspiciously in the Nerang State Forest area. He is described as Caucasian, aged in his 40s, with dark short hair and a solid build . Police say several riders have been hurt after hitting the strategically-placed objects left in the area located inland from the Gold Coast. 'The items placed on the bike trail appear to be strategically placed to force riders to either crash into them or crash whilst avoiding them,' Senior Sergeant Peter Gordon said on Wednesday. Sgt Gordon said the person responsible could face serious charges, given riders had suffered injuries. Police have released a comfit image of a man who is missing his front teeth and has been spotted acting suspiciously in the area. The man has been described as Caucasian, aged in his 40s, with dark short hair and a solid build. He was said to be wearing a black Led Zeppelin t-shirt, black shorts, a black cap and sunglasses at the time. Meanwhile, the peculiar behaviour has sparked discussion on the dirtbikeride.net website with one rider saying that he suspects the offender had also been sabotaging tracks in Bellthorpe, north of the Gold Coast . 'I got injured on the weekend by a slippery log left across a track,' Sambo posted. While other dirt bike rider commented that the obstacles were all part of the fun on the tracks.

"By . Leesa Smith . Seven is increasingly being considered unlucky among the Vietnamese community as the number has been linked to a string of air tragedies this year. Although seven can be thought of as lucky in Vietnam as it is associated with togetherness making it lucky for relationships, the online community has begun to express fear for the number. Online forums and social sites have been bombarded with people claiming it was too coincidental that the number has a common thread in the latest plane catastrophes including three occurring within seven days since July 17 in Ukraine, Taiwan, and Mali, according to Tuoi Tre News. Scroll down for video . Both MH370 and MH17 tragedies occurred in Boeing 777 planes which the Vietnamese believe is no coincidence . In the most recent aviation disaster, Air Algerie flight AH5017 crashed on July 24 with 118 people aboard dying on board the Boeing 717 jetliner. This follows the Indian air force helicopter crash where seven passengers were killed in the country’s northern region at 17:00 hours on Friday. Both Malaysian airline disasters have seven featuring in the flight numbers – MH370 and MH17 with both incidents occurring on Boeing 777 planes. While the MH17 flight, which was shot down in eastern Ukraine with 298 people on board, has the number seven appear another four times surrounding the atrocity. The doomed plane had been in use for exactly 17 years from 17/07/1997 to 17/07/2014 before it was shot down above Ukraine en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur at 17:17 local time. The doomed MH17 plane (parts of the remains pictured) had been in use for exactly 17 years from 17/07/1997 to 17/07/2014 before it was shot en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur at 17:17 local time . To add to the nation’s obsession of associating bad luck with the number, there were two air crashes that occurred within 10 days before MH17 was downed which has seven related to both incidents. A Vietnamese military Mi-171 helicopter crashed on the outskirts of Hanoi killing a total of 19 soldiers at 7:53 local time on 07/07. Exactly seven days later, on 14/07, a military helicopter sank on the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh, killing five trainee soldiers on board. While a helicopter carrying emergency workers crashed in an urban area in the South Korean city of Gwangju, killing five firefighters and rescue personnel happened just three days later on 17/07. To complete the superstitious list, a TransAsia Airways ATR72 aircraft crashed killing all 58 passengers during a second landing attempt on the typhoon-battered island of Penghu in Taiwan on 23/07. This comes as many conspiracy theorists have claimed that The Illuminati carried out the MH17 attack as part of its longstanding masterplan to trigger a third world war and establish a New World Order - mainly because of the plane's links to the number seven. Many modern theories suggest that world events are being controlled and manipulated by the Illuminati, a secretive and ancient society blamed by proponents for a string of world events including the Battle of Waterloo, the French Revolution and President John F. Kennedy's assassination. There have even been suggestions that the group is in fact a Communist pressure party hellbent on creating a new world order by infiltrating the Hollywood film industry.

A distraught family has been forced out of their home in NSW after it was discovered their property is one of 1,000 which was sprayed with the asbestos product Mr Fluffy during the 1960s and the 1970s. The Ziolkowski's had to abandon their Queanbeyan house last week and are now living a rental flat when it was revealed they had unknowingly been inhaling the asbestos particles through the home's heating system for several years, 7.30 reported. Lisa Ziolkowski was choked with emotion as she struggled to describe about being told the horrific revelation: ‘There's no words to describe what that feels like.' Scroll down for video . The Ziolkowski family had to abandon their home in Queanbeyan last week after discovering it was riddled with asbestos . The Ziolkowskis have been left with no choice but to rent a small serviced apartment and are unable to sell their asbestos-infested property. ‘We can't afford to knock it down and we still have to pay for it, even though we're not living in it,’ she said. ‘We still have to pay for rent as well as paying for the home we can't live in.’ Their home was one of 1,000 properties around Canberra and parts of NSW which was sprayed by the Mr Fluffy loose-fill asbestos in the 1960s and the 1970s - and now affected owners are calling on the government for action. A Fluffy Owners and Residents' Action Group has been formed in Canberra with the group’s founder Brianna Heseltine asking the government to ‘draw a line under Mr Fluffy homes in Australia.' Fluffy Owners and Residents' Action Group founder Brianna Heseltine (pictured) is asking the government to 'draw a line under Mr Fluffy homes in Australia.' The Mr Fluffy home owners are seeking financial aid from the ACT and federal government with some elderly people requesting their homes to be cleaned, other owners wanting to sell their properties and many hoping to demolish and rebuild. ‘I don't understand why a government 20 years ago didn't do what we are asking the governments to do today,’ Ms Heseltine said. The Federal Government was warned about the product in the 1960s, but it wasn’t until the late 1980s that a $100 million clean-up was put in place across Canberra homes. While the government knew it was possible that all of the fluff may not have been removed - it was presumed the homes were safe. Mr Fluffy sprayed loose-fill asbestos in more than 1,000 homes around Canberra and parts of NSW in the 1960s and the 1970s . Peter Tighe, from the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency, said Mr Fluffy as the ‘most dangerous product that's been put in place in Australian houses over the last 50 or 60 years.’ It was marketed as 'asbestos fluff', the perfect insulating material that 'retains effectiveness forever'. ACT Chief Minister Katy Gallagher has set up a taskforce to find solutions and said while there was a growing case to demolish most homes - there was no easy or one-fit solution. Canberra was expected to request a lower interest loan from the Federal government while the homes in NSW, which were not part of the original clean-up 20 years ago, are still left in with a deadly dust hanging over them with no certainty of plans for the future.

"By . Leesa Smith . A Hindu man was gobsmacked to find out that his favourite Golden Circle juice contains traces of meat and alcohol. Sonjoy Chakraborty, from Melbourne, discovered the shocking revelation when he decided to write to Heinz Australia after he heard that such ingredients could be found in some fruit drinks. The company replied saying that the Golden Circle long-life range was made using a clarifying agent derived from beef and that alcohol-based flavours were used across the drinks range. ‘This is wrong and unethical,’ Mr Chakraborty told GoodFood. ‘We are Hindu, beef is prohibited, alcohol is prohibited. But also I don’t want to give anything that contains alcohol to my kids.’ The clear apple juice used in the Golden Circle long life juice and drink range is made clear using a variety of clarifying agents one of which is from a beef source . Sonjoy Chakraborty was disgusted to discover traces of beef could be found in Golden Circle juice as being a Hindu his religion prohibits him to eat it . Heinz responded confirming none of the ambient Golden Circle juice range was halal suitable as they are made using either non-halal clarifying agents or contain alcohol based flavours and encouraged consumers to ‘carefully’ read the ingredients on the packaging. However the Golden Circle apple juice is labelling as containing no added preservatives and makes no mention of beef or alcohol. Mr Chakraborty replied calling on the company to come clean and explain to consumers why the ingredients were not listed on packaging. ‘In the ingredients section it says ‘all natural’,’ he said. ‘I don't think beef traces or alcohol [can] be treated as natural ingredients.’ A beef-derived gelatine was generally used to remove the ‘cloudiness’ in its apple juice, Heinz said in a statement to Fairfax Media . Spokeswoman Carolyn Fox said juice was filtered during the manufacturing process, and the final product did not contain gelatine. Heinz said 'very small amounts of alcohol' were combined with concentrated flavours for them to remain 'stable, clean and crisp' Heinz said the products met regulatory standards therefore there was no requirement to declare the processing aids, or components of flavours on the list of ingredients . Ms Fox said ‘very small amounts of alcohol’ were combined with concentrated flavours for them to remain ‘stable, clean and crisp’. ‘Alcohol has the functional purpose of allowing the flavour to disperse more readily in liquids,’ she said. ‘It evaporates from the juice during the pasteurisation process when heat is applied and if any remains in juices afterwards, it is so small that it is below detectable levels.’ She also stated that the products met regulatory standards therefore there was no requirement to declare the processing aids, or components of flavours on the list of ingredients.","A Hindu man was gobsmacked to find out Golden Circle juice contains traces of meat and alcohol .

"By . Leesa Smith . Ice use has doubled in Australia within the last three years, overtaking ecstasy and heroin as the hard drug of choice within the community. Use of the deadly and addictive ice, otherwise known as crystal methamphetamine, doubled between 2010 and 2013, while ecstasy and heroin have shown a slight decline, figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare drug and alcohol survey show. While the use of methamphetamine remained at a similar level to 2010, there was a major shift from using it in the powdered form to the crystal variety known as ice, AIHW spokesperson Geoff Neideck said. The misuse of pharmaceuticals has also risen, increasing from 4.2 per cent in 2010 to 4.7 per cent in 2013. Australians are using double the amount of ice than in 2010 . On a brighter note, the study found Australians have cut back on cigarettes and alcohol between 2010 and 2013. More teenagers aged from 12 to 17 are now abstaining from alcohol, while the age that kids have their first drink increasing from an average of 14 to almost 16 in the last 15 years. The number of Australians who have reported being the victim of an alcohol-related incident in 2013 has fallen to 26 per cent from 29 per cent in 2010. The Australian Drug Foundation John Rogerson chief executive said although prevention strategies were working, authorities should not be complacent. ‘We know that the younger a person drinks alcohol the more likely they are to binge drink and have a problem with alcohol later in life,’ he said. ‘But Australia is still very much in the grip of a dangerous love affair with booze.’ Ice has taken over from ecstasy and heroin as the illicit drug of choice . More teenagers are abstaining from alcohol with a rise of eight per cent but there had been a slight increase in the age of when kids had tried their first drink . In other good news for the health of Australians, smokers are also cutting down on the number of cigarettes their are having each week.  In 2010, they smoked 111 cigarettes a week, while in 2013 that had fallen to 96. The smoking rate for the Australian population has fallen from 15.1 per cent in 2010 to 12.8 per cent in 2013. rate was 15.1 per cent down to 12.8 per cent in 2013. Quit Victoria policy manager Kylie Lindorff said the smoking data highlighted what could be achieved with a comprehensive approach to tobacco control. ‘This news is cause for celebration but we can't take our eyes off the ball - we still have a way to go to achieve the federal government target of 10 per cent of adults smoking prevalence by 2018,’ she said. ‘With tax increases already locked in for the next three years, there is no reason we can't see smoking rates drop even further if there is a renewed investment to funding anti-smoking campaigns at the necessary levels and a continued expansion of smokefree areas.’ The National Drug Strategy Household Survey is conducted every two to three years. The 2013 survey collected data from nearly 24,000 people across Australia.","Ice, or crystal methamphetamine, has doubled in use as ecstasy and heroin declined between 2010 and 2013 .

"By . Leesa Smith . Being held at gunpoint, pretending to be drunk so he can slip away from his minders and being woken up every day by hypnotic music and propaganda blaring out of speakers - these are just some of the everyday goings on witnessed by an Australian tourist in North Korea. Mark Fahey has had a 40-year fascination with the communist country that is shut off from the world, crossing the border four times in four years in an attempt to see what life is really like for the country's oppressed citizens. On one visit, he had a soldier's rifle stuck in his back after he strayed from his tourist party - but escaped with some amazing and unsanctioned images. Mr Fahey, 54, a business developer from Sydney, told Daily Mail Australia the country wakes to eery, ear piercing music which is played through speakers in the street at 6am for about 20 minutes. Scroll down for videos . Mark Fahey visited North Korea four times in four years to access photos and information to reveal the true North Korea to the outside world . Tourists never saw the true side of North Korea with the capital city Pyongyang portrayed as the perfect world . A propaganda mural in a high school floor, normally not accessible to tourists, that encourages students to study hard so they can have a chance to kill the enemies: the Americans and Japanese . That strange alarm clock is followed by propaganda speeches at 7am and then marching music at 8am as downtrodden citizens make their way to their jobs, which usually involves 12 to 14-hour shifts working for state-run companies. And there's no rest from Kim Jong Un's message at work either as propaganda continues to play on more speakers throughout the day. One of Mr Fahey’s most surreal moments came when he asked one of the minders about the early morning music and was met with an unexpected response. ‘He looked at me like I was crazy and said “what music?”,’ he said. ‘Instead of being educated they are trained – they are not taught to be inquisitive like we are in the west.’ Mr Fahey also questioned why the buildings were not labelled with its function but with yet more propaganda about the Supreme Leader and his army. ‘Their thinking is if I needed to know I would be told,’ he explained.'The minder couldn't understand why he would need to know such a thing.'

A propaganda painting shows what North Korean girls dream of: missiles . The dimly-lit hallway of a high school in Pyongyang. The country has a limited production of electricity, so buildings use as little energy as possible . Just like most people who visited North Korea, Mr Fahey joined a travel group with two tour guides, or minders, who controlled everything that the tourists saw. It was a punishing itinerary, often as long as 14 hours a day of sightseeing in the hope visitors would be worn out and pass out in the evening, preventing them from sneaking out on their own. But Mr Fahey, who was an expert on the propaganda long before landing in the country, played the part of a ‘useful idiot’ and would regurgitate the country’s brainwashed beliefs about their devotion to Kim Jong Un and his army to the naive minders. Once befriending his trusty travel guides with a tipple or two in the evening, Mr Fahey pretended to drunkenly stagger off to bed - but would in fact sneak off for up to hours at a time. 'The whole country is a mass religious cult  - it’s very much like The Hunger Games, you don’t choose where you live or travel outside of a 25-30km radius without a permit,' he said. ‘I was never fearful as I thought the worst would that happen is I would get detained and deported.’ Although Mr Fahey never got caught being out at night, there were a few occasions when he was found sneaking off during the day, including on a visit to the sacred mountain of Mount Baekdu on his first trip. ‘The minders let us look around on our own for two hours only because we were so remote but I found military tunnels then next thing I know I had a gun in my back,’ he said. ‘They marched me away from the area and took my photos but not my memory card so I was able to retrieve the photos back in Australia – this is one of the many ways the North Koreans are so inept.’ The portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il in a subway car in Pyongyang . A shrine celebrating the Kim family in the entrance of a building in Pyongyang. These shrines are present in practically every building, Fahey says . A propaganda painting showing Kim Il Sung, the first leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,his wife, Kim Jong Suk and and baby Kim Jong-Il, who would later succeed his father as Supreme Leader . Another daring daylight moment was when Mr Fahey managed to sneak away during a tour of a high school when he pretended that he urgently needed a toilet. 'They let me go on my own but only because I had known them for a couple of weeks,' he said. 'I saw a propaganda mural in a high school floor, normally not accessible to tourists, that encourages students to study hard so they can have a chance to kill the enemies: the Americans and Japanese.' When he quickly dashed up the stairwell on his supposed bathroom break, he also saw a confronting poster of North Korean students stabbing members of what represented the American army with a fountain pen. 'Occasionally when I would sneak away for three or four minutes during the day I would get caught but I would play the stupid tourist and act confused,' he said. 'I took about 10,000 photos on each trip and about 60 per cent of those were taken without permission.' He recalls not being allowed to take photos of an ox pulling a hoe on the street because it didn't symbolise an advanced country. Mr Fahey is satisfied with never being able to return to North Korea after going public with his agenda because he feels he has all of the information he was hoping for. Each trip took up to 12 months of preparation with his modes of transport varying from planes, a train and even one time by walking over the border from China. He had to conceal his electronic devices including radio and TV receivers inside consumer products such as cameras, USB stick and Ipods to ensure the equipment wasn’t confiscated at the borders.

North Koreans are taught not to think for themselves but follow the wise teachings of their king . ‘They say they are going to destroy the world but they don’t have the capability,’ he said. ‘You are not encouraged to think for yourself as they don’t have a wide variety of information sources – you are to follow the wise teachings of the king.’ Mr Fahey couldn't understand why the hotel he was staying in didn't have a fifth floor until he went snooping and found the floor, which was for staff only, adorned with propaganda posters filling the walls of the hallways. 'A group of us were suspicious so we went to check it out one night,' he said. 'There was a poster saying: ""Get revenge 1,000 times against the Americans"".' Mr Fahey said it alarmed him how quickly he was conditioned to a conformist's life. ‘It was really mind-blowing when I got to China and could walk wherever I wanted – I hadn’t even realised what I had lost,’ he said. ‘I gave into my freedoms without even realising – all of sudden there was a sense of colour, advertising and neon lights.’ Mr Fahey said the country’s capital, Pyongyang, is showcased as the perfect city and home to a utopian society. ‘You never saw anything bad because in the capital city Pyongyang is where only the elite live who are part of Kim Jong Un’s army,’ he said. ‘You never got to meet the true North Koreans you only ever saw them working in fields when you were on a train.’ The forced image was clearly working with a good portion of visitors as Mr Fahey was surprised by how many within the tour group believed the facade that was put on for the westerners. 'I would say half of the tour group swallowed the propaganda,' he said. 'They became apologists for the most vile regime on the planet.' Mr Fahey described the country as a surreal fantasy land. ‘The tour is like a theme park where you are being taken to different propaganda rides,’ he said. ‘The leaders are like cartoon characters always in the same clothes like Bart Simpson.’ Children dancing during an elementary school propaganda concert .

"By . Leesa Smith . Homophobic slurs cut much deeper than the harshest of tackles for gay rugby player Brennan Bastyovanszky when he moved to Sydney to start a new life 10 years ago. He may be six foot and 100kg but names still hurt the 35-year-old Canadian who quit the game he loves for four years because after being ostracized from the team he joined in Sydney once it was discovered he was gay. ‘The words and the jokes hurt more than any tackle I’ve ever experienced or any boot that was given to me at the bottom of a ruck – it hurts a lot more, cut a lot deeper and the scars stayed a lot longer,’ he recalls. Bastyovanszky participated in the Out in the Fields survey which reveals 85 per cent of gay people have witnessed or experienced homophobia when either playing sport or as a spectator. Scroll down for video . Brennan Bastyovanszky was ostracized by the rugby team he joined when he moved to Sydney after the club found out he was gay . Bastyovanszky left the club and gave up the game he loves for four years . While half of the 2,500 Australians surveyed have been the target of homophobia and more than one in four gay people had experienced verbal threats, ongoing bullying or were excluded from social groups. Although Bastyovanszky was the target of such bullying, he didn’t expect the figures to be quite so alarming. ‘I’m not particularly surprised but I didn’t realise it was that bad,’ he said. ‘It confirms how bad it is and that it can happen anywhere.’ Bastyovanszky, 35, moved from Canada to Australia to play rugby and live for the first time as a gay man but deliberately kept both parts of his life separate. ‘I felt like I shouldn’t come out in that environment because there was no one else gay and there was teasing going around,’ he said. ‘ While no one ever physically threatened me, I had concerns about whether or not I would be injured or if not, humiliated, so I never felt like I was part of the group.’ He was playing in first and second grade for about five seasons until his club found out that he was a homosexual and his was quickly living his worst fear. ‘The penny didn’t drop until a new coach asked why I was playing in the fourths,’ he said. ‘All of a sudden merit and ability was not a factor - the sport I loved had rejected me after 15 years.’ Bastyovanszky hasn't look back since joining the Sydney Convicts gay rugby team two years ago . Bastyovanszky had always received subtle homophobic remarks before the club found out about his sexuality but he soon became an outcast as news spread of him being spotted in a gay publication. ‘Some of the players withdrew they didn’t know to interact with me so it became quite an awkward circumstance ‘I would get put on 10 minutes at end of the game so from an administrative perspective it looked like I was playing every week but I was playing less and less and not having a close connection with the guys like I had in previous years.’ He quit the game for four years but was finally convinced to join the gay rugby team Sydney Convicts and has never looked back. ‘I encourage people to go looking for a team where you will be welcome – I have found so much joy and happiness by combining the two loves of my life - being gay and rugby and it took me eight to be comfortable combining them,’ he said.","Brennan Bastyovanszky was the target of homophobic slurs when he joined a Sydney rugby team 10 years ago .

Almost three quarters of Australians (72 per cent) now support legalising same sex marriage including 48 per cent expressing strong support for the change. While only a fifth (21 per cent) opposed it with those strongly opposed at a small and shrinking 14 per cent. This overwhelming figure is the highest level of support and lowest percentage of opposition ever recorded on this question with support for same-sex marriage doubling since 2004 and still rising. Scroll down for video . Almost three quarters of Australians (72 per cent) now support legalising same sex marriage including 48 per cent expressing strong support for the change . The overwhelming figure is the highest level of support and lowest percentage of opposition ever recorded on this question with support for same-sex marriage doubling since 2004 and still rising . Mark Textor of Crosby|Textor said the results showed a clear and steady upward trend compared to other national telephone polls conducted over the last decade. ‘The fact that nearly three-quarters of Australians support allowing gay couples to marry is exciting in itself – rarely do you get such a clear-cut endorsement,’ he said. ‘But the really exciting part for me is the long-term trend; support rising steadily from just 38 per cent when Newspoll first posed the question a decade ago.’ The Crosby Textor telephone poll, commissioned on behalf of Marriage Equality Australia, was conducted in June and involved 1,000 randomly-selected Australian adults across the country. Australian Marriage Equality national director Rodney Croome said the research will be used to work with the government who have yet to declare support for any reform to show them they have nothing to fear. ‘With Australians across all key demographics supporting marriage equality in record numbers, it's fair to say the public has made up its mind, the community debate is over, and it's time for politicians to act,’ he said. “With Australians firmly behind marriage equality, it no longer needs to be a heated or divisive issue and can instead be one where people unite across the political spectrum to achieve reform.” Mr Croome said it was significant to point out that support for marriage equality was now higher in Australia than in many other countries when they had achieved the reform. A majority of those who identify with major religions supported marriage equality, including Catholics, Anglicans and non-Christian religions . Meanwhile politicians are echoing the support of the community. Senator Leyonhjelm said an `it's time' factor was gaining momentum. 'The sky hasn't fallen in anywhere else (where) they've done it,' he said. Independent senator Nick Xenophon said he supported same-sex marriage and called on the government to grant its MPs a conscience vote. 'Gays have every right to be as miserable as heterosexuals,' he said. While Labor senator Lisa Singh said marriage equality was long overdue and parliament needed to reflect the wishes of the majority of Australians and support change.","Almost three quarters of Australians support same sex marriage .

After watching himself on the TV screen when he won $212,000 on the Million Dollar Minute show on Tuesday night Mr Somic promptly signed up to a hard core boot camp in Thailand for three months for a complete transformation. ‘I thought “ooh I’m taking up a bit of that screen”,’ he said. ‘I’m hoping to look like a different person - I want to look like Tom Hardy in the movie Bronson.’ ‘I would rather have a bit of heft and muscle on me but just a little bit less marshmallow,’ he said when comparing himself to the notorious prisoner Michael Gordon Peterson played by Hardy in the film.

The money couldn’t come at a better time for the biomedicine university student who had to get his father to drive him to the TV studio to appear on the show because he couldn’t afford the bus fare. The 26-year-old ballooned to 150kg – the heaviest he has ever weighed, after lost his job in November and became complacent about his lifestyle. ‘I’m quite a bad cook and a bit lazy – it creeps on you,’ he explains. ‘You don’t have money to go out but you’ve always got enough to maybe get a pizza or a takeaway and sit at home.’ The Melbourne resident gave up drinking coffee and smoking to cut costs but his appetite naturally increased. ‘When I smoked I rarely had ice cream and now I can’t get enough of it,’ he said. ‘It’s easier to be healthy when you’ve got money – it’s easy to be big when you’re poor.’ Will Jonathan (right) be able to pull off the smouldering Tom Hardy look (left) within three months?

Mr Somic plans to lose 20kg before he leaves for Thailand in November and hopes to shed a further  10- 20kgs at the intense holistic retreat. ‘I’m tiring myself out just talking about it but I plan to take nothing over with me and just live the full bare bones dorm life there,’ he said before he takes a month-long European trip with his girlfriend. He lost 11kg in five weeks about four years ago when he signed up to a similar camp in Thailand. ‘But then my mates came over at Christmas and a little tipple turned into a lot and the 11kg very quickly became 5 or 6kg,’ he said. Somic is looking forward to buying a brand new wardrobe when the weight starts to fall off. But he doesn’t plan on blowing all of the cash he won - he has paid off $8,000 in credit card debt. ‘That was a nice feeling after only being able to pay the minimum for 18 months,’ he said.

The show’s host Simon Reeve described Mr Somic as the ‘fastest and funniest contestant who has pushed a buzzer on Million Dollar Minute’. ‘He brought with him a formidable intelligence and a cracking sense of humour that had all of us in stitches,” Reeve said.

Rhys Edwin Martin, 22, is on trial accused of infecting a 59-year-old Brisbane man with the disease in 2012, after the former sex worker learnt he had HIV in early 2011, the Brisbane District Court heard on Tuesday. About 18 months after being diagnosed, he met his alleged victim and the man's male partner for a 'random hook-up' after meeting them on gay website Manhunt, the court heard on Tuesday. Rhys Edwin Martin, 22, is on trial accused of infecting a 59-year-old Brisbane man with the disease in 2012, while the former sex worker learnt he had HIV in early 2011, the Brisbane District Court heard on Tuesday . Martin told police he stayed with the couple in their north Brisbane unit and had unprotected sex with them several times over three months. Prosecutors say Martin initially told the couple he was HIV negative and had a preference for unprotected sex, but later boasted he wanted to give the disease to married men who were police officers, firefighters and ambulance paramedics. Martin told police he was ‘scared’ to reveal his state because he did not want to return to his former living arrangement. ‘If I had've told them they wouldn't have kept me around, and I would've been stuck out in Goodna (west of Brisbane) in a garage,’ he told detectives in an interview played to the jury. Martin also told police he did not reveal his condition to up to four other sex partners. ‘Are you aware ... that you're obliged to advise sexual partners of your state?’ a detective asked during the interview. ‘I am now,’ Martin replied, adding he had become aware only one to two months earlier. Martin met his alleged victim and the man's male partner for a 'random hook-up' after meeting them on gay website Manhunt (pictured) and stayed with them having unprotected sex for three months . The court heard the alleged victim eventually became suspicious of Martin, who had sores on his arms, and the couple took him to get a blood test, which came back positive for HIV. A doctor testified the 59-year-old tested positive for HIV a month later and the virus had been transmitted in the previous year. Martin has pleaded not guilty to committing a malicious act with intent. The trial continues.

The Kiis FM host’s latest antic of vomiting live on air this morning has put the spotlight on his ballooning weight with medical professionals expressing grave concern about the 43 year-old’s future. Sandilands and his co-host Jackie O were halfway through an interview on their morning show when he announced ‘hang on, I feel really sick,’ before vomiting into a bin. Scroll down for video . The 43-year-old is in the prime danger age for heart attacks and even possible early death . Sandilands pictured left having breakfast at Mel's Diner on the Sunset strip in LA with his girlfriend Imogen Anthony (right) has been warned to change his eating habits due to health risks . Dietitian Julie Meek described Sandilands' public moment as a possible cry for help . Sandilands (left) lighting up a a cigarette with girlfriend Imgoen Anthony (right) on Sunset strip in LA - is in the high risk category for heart disease and heart attack . The outspoken host managed to take time between vomiting to commentate on the incident: ‘I don't know whether it is that bloody ridiculous story you have been telling.’ Producers promptly switched to advertising as Sandilands continued to vomit into the plastic bin but later on tweeted about the drama to followers and posted a video on the station’s website. Accredited practising dietitian Julie Meek described the unnecessarily public moment as a possible cry for help. ‘If he wanted to keep that quiet he would absolutely not make any mention of that publicly maybe some of it is “I need some help”,’ she said.  ‘If he keeps going on with these habits the end result will be a heart attack or obviously early death which is fairly major.’ Sandilands has admitted in the past to eating half a loaf of bread with a milkshake every day for breakfast but his manager told the Daily Telegraph in 2012 that his client did not have diabetes and he saw a doctor regularly. He even received an offer from the radio station's CEO to train the host with his boss tweeting: . 'We’re safe to say that -  based on previous experiences with exercise - Kyle isn’t likely to take up the offer and has no interest in changing his lifestyle just now.' It was well-reported that he attempted to train with Commando from The Biggest Loser but gave up almost as soon as he started back in April 2007. But Sandilands is not alone with his issues to keep his weight down with one in three Australians overweight suffering the same problem - equating to an an astounding 12 million people.

I am up here getting ready for the game and I’ve just seen that crap from Harry — he’s a big poofter,’ Taylor said.‘You can’t be doing the old royal wave, next thing you’ll have your mum and dad out there.’ Laughter came from the panel which consisted of Luke Darcy, Cameron Ling, Sam Lane, Matthew Richardson and Mick Molloy, The Herald Sun reported.

"By . Leesa Smith . Sydney may have impressively dropped 17 places out of the top ten of the world’s most expensive cities but it still remains a costly lifestyle for residents who live in Australia’s biggest city. While it may not be a winner for Australians that the harbour city fell from nine in 2013 to 26 in Mercer’s 2014 Cost of Living Survey, it’s an attractive package for expatriates as the local currency has depreciated against the US dollar. Australian cities have witnessed some of the most dramatic falls in the ranking this year with Melbourne also dropping 17 spots from 16 to 33 and Perth stepping down 19 places to 37, while Brisbane and Canberra both fell out of the top 50. Sydney dropped 17 places out of the top ten of the world's most expensive cities from nine in 2013 to 26 in Mercer's 2014 Cost of Living Survey . Mercer’s Talent Business Pacific leader Garry Adams said the latest Cost of Living Index results were promising for companies considering establishing headquarters in Australia or relocating expats. ‘The drop in rankings mean Australia becomes more attractive for global talent because ex-pats’ dollars will go further, it does not mean that Australian cities have become cheaper for Australians,’ he said. ‘Changes in the value of the Australian dollar against the US dollar are the primary reasons for the drop in our rankings.’ The strengthening of the Chinese yuan and currencies in Western Europe against the US dollar has also seen countries in these regions become more expensive, and drive Australian and New Zealand cities down the list. Melbourne also dropped 17 spots from 16 to 33 but it doesn't make Australians' lifestyles any cheaper . Mr Adams said companies will find it easier to justify using one of the major Australian cities as a headquarter for their Asia Pacific operations . ‘We know Australian cities are already a very attractive location for corporates due to our high quality of living, multicultural and multi-lingual workforce and Asian region time zone,’ he said. ‘The drop in costs means they become even more attractive as a location for global assignments.’ ‘Compared to last year, where Sydney sat within the top 10 most expensive cities globally, we were looking at ensuring salaries adequately reflected the difference in cost of living to an employee’s home country in order to attract and retain talent,’ he said. ‘Now, we’re provided with a lot more flexibility in setting salaries and attracting employees from the global talent pool, knowing the expat dollar will go a lot further here.' The survey covers 211 cities across five continents and measures the comparative cost of over 200 items in each location, including housing, transportation, food, clothing, household goods, and entertainment . Perth, which dropped down 19 places to 37, is one of the cities that will look attractive to relocating expats and companies looking to operate in the Asia Pacific .","Sydney dropped 17 places out of the top ten of the world’s most expensive cities but residents won't benefit from the impressive ranking .

"By . Leesa Smith . Federal Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce has accused the animal rights group PETA as using disturbing footage of sheep being abused for 'convenient political effect'. Mr Joyce slammed the group as ‘extremist’, and calls on PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) to divulge the details of the footage they claim was shot at 19 shearing stations across NSW, Victoria and South Australia between August 2013 and March 2014. The confronting vision reveals shearers stamping on the heads and necks of sheep when the animals appeared to panic and also throwing the sheep around and slamming their heads and bodies against hard wooden floors. Scroll down for video . Farmers were captured throwing sheep around and slamming their heads and bodies against hard wooden floors in shearing sheds across NSW, Victoria and South Australia . Mr Joyce calls on PETA to divulge the details of the footage they claim was shot between August 2013 and March 2014 . Mr Joyce said PETA should have reported the incidents instead of releasing the vision overnight on Thursday for the most 'convenient political effect.' ‘An emotional response without full investigation, including why it has taken so long for PETA to release the footage, does not result in better husbandry practices,’ he said. ‘It just reinforces the belief that PETA is an extremist group that wants to end livestock production and to irreparably damage the economy and the reputation of Australian farmers.’ ‘Otherwise it can be seen as not so much an attempt to end the cruelty, but rather another mechanism to attack rural industry in Australia,’ he said. He also questioned the authority the group had to film on private property. The minister is working with the states on controversial ‘ag-gag’ laws to stop activists from placing cameras in factory farms in the hope of exposing animal welfare breaches. ‘While I don't condone the activity, if a man kicks a dog you don't ban the ownership of dogs or automatically think all dog owners are cruel,’ Mr Joyce said. They were captured on video violently punching sheep in the face in 19 shearing stations across the country . Three PETA US investigators went undercover in 19 shearing sheds across the country and claim to have witnessed attacks by 70 workers, which often left the animals bleeding from their eyes, noses and mouths. 'They were given jobs and they worked with nine different shearing companies. Filming happened openly and many shearers were aware they were being filmed,' Claire Fryer, from PETA Australia, told MailOnline. Wool Producers Australia (WPA) president Geoff Fisken said the actions of shearers in the video was 'unacceptable and unsupportable', according to Stock & Land. Mr Fisken added the footage showed isolated incidents by a few shearers. 'We’re sure it doesn’t portray the 99.9 per cent majority of wool shearers and those shearers would be appalled by it as well,' he said. 'Woolgrowers condemn this treatment of animals; we’re not in the business of treating animals like that and nor are shearers. Shearers were captured stamping on the heads and necks of sheep when the animals appeared to panic . The attacks often left the animals bleeding from their eyes, noses and mouths, according to animal rights activists . 'We want that type of behaviour to be removed from shearing sheds in Australia.' The RSPCA said the allegations made public by PETA were serious. 'The allegations are serious and will be investigated by RSPCA Inspectors as information comes to hand for potential breaches of the relevant state animal welfare legislation,' a spokeswoman said. Outcry has also come in the US over the footage which shows the same treatment of animals in American ranches. Despite not having seen the footage, a representative of the main U.S. wool industry trade group, the American Wool Council, told NBC News the behavior described by PETA was 'unacceptable.' 'We do not condone or support the actions of anyone that results in the abuse of sheep either intentionally or unintentionally,' Rita Samuelson told the website. 'Rough handling of animals that might result in the injury of a sheep is an unacceptable maneuver during the shearing process or anytime when sheep are handled.' Shocking footage was released in 2011 by Animals Australia showing the sever mistreatment of animals being exported to Indonesia . Following its release live exports were banned for nearly a month by the Australian government . In 2011 animal cruelty in the live export industry was put under the microscope after footage released by Animals Australia showed cattle being inhumanely slaughtered in Australian centres in Indonesia. This prompted a national and international outcry, and live exports to Indonesia were suspended for just under a  month, from June 7 to July 6 2011. Following this, the Australian government were forced to put in place stronger safeguards to ensure the well being of all animals leaving Australia, but animal rights groups argue the situation has not improved. Following the more recent footage released on Thursday, The PETA investigators claim farmers put tight rings on some lambs' scrotums with anaesthetics to castrate them, but when that failed shearers would just cut off their testicles with shears. The animals were also deprived of food and water before being sheared so they were too weak to fight, they claim. Footage shows the shearers violently beating sheep and jabbing them in the head with sharp metal clippers and even a hammer. Activists claim no painkillers were administered to the sheep before shearers used needles to sew gaping, bloody wounds caused by the shearing. The shearers were captured violently beating sheep and jabbing them in the head with sharp metal clippers and even a hammer . The animals were given no painkillers  before shearers used needles to sew gaping, bloody wounds caused by the shearing . 'Sheep are very gentle animals. Most of the sheep weren’t resisting in any way so it would have been especially frightening for them,' Ms Fryer said. 'I think it’s extremely shocking. Sheep are very gentle animals. They show fear if they’re on their own. 'It’s devastating and no compassionate person could watch that footage and not be horrified.' The footage was released by PETA in a new campaign targeting the Australian wool industry. Mr Fisken said $2.8 million had been spent by WPA in the last year to train shearers to prevent injury or cruelty. 'There will be a fair bit of attention focused on the industry now and we’re disappointed because we’ve come a long way in the last 10 years with animal welfare standards and we’re continuing to put a lot of resources into that area of our business; it’s a high priority,' he said. He added that WPA would never make PETA happy because the activists wanted them to stop farming all together. 'But we have standards and they're the same as they are for how people treat their family pet,' he said. Overnight, the RSPCA received cruelty complaints from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) regarding the alleged ill treatment of sheep during shearing in New South Wales and South Australia between August 2013 and March 2014. The allegations relate to workers beating, kicking and stomping on sheep, and stitching wounds without anaesthetic. The vision made publicly available by PETA overnight shows sheep being beaten with shearing hand pieces and thrown down a chute. Sheep that had been injured during shearing are roughly stitched up. RSPCA notes that shearing is stressful for sheep and it should be carried out by trained and competent workers. The allegations are serious and will be investigated by RSPCA Inspectors as information comes to hand for potential breaches of the relevant state animal welfare legislation.","Animal rights group PETA claim the footage was shot at 19 shearing stations across NSW, Victoria and South Australia .

"By . Leesa Smith . Six public housing properties with a multimillion dollar view of Sydney harbour are set to go under the hammer while the tenants have been relocated. The heritage-listed homes in Millers Point and Dawes Point are the first of the 293 government-owned properties, 214 of which are heritage-listed, to be auctioned in a bid to make an expected hundreds of millions of dollars. The NSW government’s justification for evicting the 300 tenants, many of whom have lived in the properties for the entire lives, was that three houses could be built in other Sydney suburbs for every house sold in Millers Point. Six heritage-listed public housing properties with this multimillion dollar view are set to be auctioned in Millers point and Dawes Point . The six properties are expected to sell up to 1.8million each while similar properties in the area have been known to be sold for up to $3million . 30 Argyle Place in Millers Point is said to be worth the value of up to three houses in many other Sydney suburbs . The government’s justification for evicting the tenants, many of whom have lived in the properties for the entire lives, was that three houses could be built in other Sydney suburbs for every house sold in Millers Point. Family and Community Services minister Gabrielle Upton said it wasn’t fair to the 58,000 applicants on the social housing waiting list for the government to spend hundreds of millions of dollars maintaining properties unsuitable public housing. ‘While we are very conscious that this involves relocating tenants who live in these properties, a tough decision had to be taken that will benefit far more people in need of housing assistance,’ she said. Finance and Services minister Dominic Perrottet, said the process of relocating tenants was being done with ‘sensitivity and compassion’ and a Tenant Relocation Team was ‘going to great lengths to satisfy their specific requests’. Evicted: Millers Point residents Barry Gardner, 65, (left) and Patricia Haub, 77, (right) will be relocated when the government sells the social housing properties for potentially $2million each . Under the hammer: 11 Lower Street Dawes Point . 23 Lower Fort street is one of the first three properties being auctioned in Dawes Point . The government claims to restore and maintain the properties would cost as much as $100million and the average maintenance bill of each house averages about $14,500 a year compared with $3,000 to $3,500 across the rest of NSW. The Daily Telegraph reported that the houses are expected to sell up to 1.8million each while similar properties in the area have been known to be sold for up to $3million. Finance and Services minister Dominic Perrottet, said the planning or the sales processes for the Millers Point properties would not be rushed because they were of important historical significance for the people of NSW. The marketing of the properties will begin next week. 29 Lower Fort Street, Dawes Point is being sold by the government . For sale: 119 Kent Street in Millers Point .

"By . Leesa Smith . First Peppa Pig’s timeslot was messed with - now an equally popular kids TV show, In the Night Garden, has been shafted from the prime after-dinner slot which has disgusted parents. Families are incredulous that the timely 6.30pm slot has been rescheduled to 11.30am with parents using the show as the perfect wind–down time for their children at the end of the day before going to bed. Hundreds of furious parents have taken to the ABC for Kids for Parents Facebook page to vent their anger with many suggesting a name change for the TV show which is now airing in the morning. In the Night Garden kids TV show has moved from the prime 6.30pm slot to 11.30am much to the disgust of parents throughout the country . Irate parents are calling on the ABC to change the time of the show back to air when kids are winding down at the end of the day . ‘Not happy about In the Night Garden changing! It's our dinner time show before bed. They say goodnight and go to bed in it not good lunchtime!’ Jennifer O'Hara posted. ‘In The Middle Of The Day Garden??? ‘Candice Nix posted. ‘My kids are allowed tv 4:30-5:30 while I make clean/make tea and 6:30-7 while having there bottle/milk and we do dishes. So Play School, Peppa Pig and In The Night Garden. What a filthy act by the ABC!’ The ABC has already cut the Peppa Pig double episodes in the afternoons with now a single episode in the afternoon and one in the morning. Play School times have also been changed and The Wiggles moved to a much earlier slot. In an attempt to appease the irate parents, the ABC repeatedly replied to the remarks on the page suggesting that parents could access more episodes through ABC iview which added fuel to the fire. ‘Yes for you to spend money on downloading or buy the DVD....so much for free’ Alie Gebing retorted. ABC TV controller of children’s TV Deidre Brennan said the altered schedule, which was partly due  to providing for children up to six years old after 6pm, had already seen a 25 per cent rise in ratings in the 6.30pm-7pm slot in the first two nights this week. ‘ABC TV cares about kids and we value the trust that Australian families place in us to educate and entertain their children with quality local and international programming,’ she said. ‘ Changes to the program times can have an impact on both parents and kids, but we are excited to offer new channel schedules that better reflect the lives of our audience.’ ABC says it has  already seen a 25 per cent rise in ratings in the 6.30pm-7pm slot in the first two nights this week since the reshuffle of children's programs . There was similar outrage among parents when the double episodes of Peppa Pig in the afternoons was cut with now a single episode in the afternoon and one in the morning. But not all parents are outraged about the reshuffle with some suggesting a good old fashioned bedtime story was the best way to go at the end of the day. ‘Perhaps people could try reading books before bedtime rather than watching tv,’ Nicole Eyles suggested. ‘Probably more settling and a much better habit to get into. I am not saying people shouldn't watch tv, my girls watch plenty, just saying that tv shouldn't be such a big part of your life that everything falls to pieces when a tv show changes timeslot.’ Nicole England agreed saying that after dinner should be 'quiet time’. ‘Sleep psychologists recommend no tv at least an hour prior to bedtime. In our house it's on for an hour while I'm preparing dinner and doesn't get turned back on.’ she said. But the majority of parents could not agree less – expressing the show was an important part of their children’s night time routine. One parent asked:‘What morons do you have working there? If it ain’t broke then don’t fix it! Night-time routine for toddlers completely ruined!’ ‘im devastated...I need in the night garden at night...my world will end bc miss needs it to go to sleep!! I think this is a totally stupid decision!' Bree Elles declared.","Popular kids TV show, In the Night Garden, has been moved from the 6.30pm slot to 11.30am .

The search for a five-year-old boy feared drowned on the NSW Central Coast is being scaled back with rescuers failing to find any sign of the boy. Chayce Kofe was playing with relatives on the shoreline at Pearl Beach on Thursday afternoon when a large wave swept him into the ocean. It is understood he struggled behind the break for a short time as people on paddle boards tried to reach him. The underwater search effort for the missing child resumed today but police confirmed it will be abandoned if divers find no trace of the young boy's body. 'We've searched where we've hoped we would find the child and we haven't (found him),' a police spokeswoman said. 'If we don't find him today, we would have to scale back the resources pending more information.' She told Daily Mail Australia earlier it will be the last underwater dive as rescuers prepare to wind back the recovery operation to a 'grid search' of the region, which will include foot patrols, sweeps of the area and an air search 'several times a day.' 'If anything changes, (the divers) will come straight back again but worse case scenario and nothing is found this afternoon they will return to Sydney,' she said. She said rescuers will then focus on 'sweeps of the ocean and on foot several times a day'. A massive sea and air search at Pearl Beach on the Central coast to find the missing five-year-old boy turned to a recovery operation on Friday . A full-scale search involving helicopters, police divers and surf lifesavers on Thursday afternoon and throughout Friday failed to find the young boy.

A resident told the Sydney Morning Herald a young boy was the last person to spot the child in the surf. 'The child was only spotted once [in the surf], I believe, and he was actually playing at the north end of the beach and that's the rough end,' she said.

The communities span the length and breadth of England and Wales - from Herodsfoot in Cornwall to Catwick in Yorkshire. But though some were struck by bombs - losing a house, shop or church - they did not lose one human life. Many still live in the same village. Former boy soldier Robert Payne, who signed up to serve in the Second World War aged just 15, still lives in the Doubly Thankful village of Langton Herring in Dorset.

Pearl Beach general store owner Kevin McCunn said the suspected drowning is a real tragedy for the tight-knit, beachside community. The boy was holidaying at the beachside village with his family . Brisbane Water Local Area Command, the Marine Area Command and Surf Life Saving Australia all took to the waters . He said the northern end of the beach, where the young boy was playing, was a dangerous spot. 'It's been rough seas the last few days and at the north end of the beach it can be quite dangerous,' he said. A resident told the Sydney Morning Herald a young boy was the last person to spot the child in the surf. 'The child was only spotted once [in the surf], I believe, and he was actually playing at the north end of the beach and that’s the rough end,' she said. The resident, who did not want to be named, also claimed the five-year-old was playing with siblings. A full scale air and sea search was immediately conducted involving police from Brisbane Water Local Area Command, the Marine Area Command, Surf Life Saving Australia, NSW Ambulance Service and the Westpac Life Saver Helicopter and the sea search continued overnight after the light faded. Surf lifesavers told Fairfax Media the boy's family might not have been able to save him . A frantic search failed to find the boy on Thursday . A NSW police spokesperson told MailOnline on Friday morning: 'The search has resumed but there is unfortunately nothing new.' Marine Area Command officers continued the search throughout Thursday night with the assistance of the Police Rescue Squad officers. 'Because of the darkness a lot of the resources can't be used,' a police spokesman said. Dye had been released into the water during the search in order to determine the direction of the currents. A nearby restaurant owner said people on the beach were 'totally beside themselves' after hearing the news. 'We all feel sick to our stomach, we are worried about the poor parents,' Melissa, from Pearls on the Beach restaurant told TVNZ. 'It's quite rough out there.' The picturesque coastal hamlet has been a popular destination with school holidays taking place over the past week. However the beach is not patrolled. The boy went missing while swimming at Pearl Beach .","Dive effort will cease if no trace of Chayce Kofe, 5, found on Saturday .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Lawmakers in Rhode Island found a novel way to reduce rape and sexually transmitted diseases when they accidentally decriminalized prostitution. Instances of rape dropped almost by one-third, and gonorrhea infection rates among women have dropped nearly 40 per cent after legislators revealed in 2003 they had effectively legalized the exchange of sex for money. The findings are detailed in a National Bureau of Economic Research paper, and show a sharp drop in instances of those events until state once again made prostitution illegal in 2009 – and then realized a significant jump in rapes. Marked change: The number of rapes reported in Rhode Island declines after the red line, which denotes the moment officials publicly acknowledged prostitution was no longer illegal . Researchers Scott Cunningham, of Baylor University, and Manisha Shah, of UCLA, believe their findings prove conclusively that legalizing prostitution lowers instances of rape and of STD, they told the Washington Post. The discovery was made during a 2003 court case in which a judge ruled that laws then on the books were not sufficient enough to prosecute a suspected prostitute, according to the Post. Lawmakers had accidentally made the change by deleting too many words from statutes back in the 1980s and only made the discovery nearly 20 years later. The public announcement set off a wave of women being trafficked into the state to be used as sex slaves, opponents argued to the paper. But it also resulted in a sharp decline in the number of rapes being reported. Statistics show instances of rape hitting an all-time high before dropping 31 per cent during the six-years prostitution was effectively legal. Correlation: Legalizing prostitution appears to have reduced rapes in Rhode Island, according to at least two researchers . Cunningham . and Shah insist that 824 rapes were prevented by men having easier . access to prostitutes. This finding held true across three separate . methods of looking at the data. ‘I . think we have convinced ourselves that we have done everything we can . do rule out alternative explanations,’ said Cunningham. But this also raises a troubling question not addressed by the two men about whether prostitution is rape. ‘Women in prostitution generally describe it as paid rape. That’s what if feels like to them,’ psychologist Melissa Farley told the Post. Kristen Berg, an expert with Equality Now, also argued that legalizing the sex work led to more women being brought in to Rhode Island against their will. ‘Demand fuels trafficking,’ said Berg. ‘With the demand for commercial sex, there's an incentive for traffickers to traffic women and girls to these locations. With increased demand, you’d expect to see increased supply.’ Cunningham and Shah discovered the majority of the women deciding to enter the world’s oldest profession were Asian and White. They also insisted to the Post that prices dropped and the incentive for organized crime to enter the racket diminished – until the state once again made prostitution illegal. Reported rapes saw a modest jump, but to only a fraction of where they were prior to 2003, the study showed.","The laws were accidentally taken off the books in the early 1980s and not discovered changed until nearly 20 years later .
Rape rates dropped 31 per cent and STD infections rates nearly 40 per cent from 2003 to 2009, a study found .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Florida authorities have confirmed the first two cases of a painful mosquito-borne disease contracted in the United States. State health officials confirmed a Miami-Dade County female and a male in Palm Beach County have become the first two people to contract chikungya in the United States. Dozens of infections have previously been reported in Florida alone, according to the Tampa Bay Times, but these are the first two to have been contracted in the States. Scroll down for video . Not contagious among humans: Chikungunya is transmitted through mosquito bites . The Miami-Dade woman, 41. started complaining of symptoms June 10, according to the Miami Herald, and the 50-year-old male from Palm Beach County first reported his symptoms on July 1. Neither had travelled outside the country, sources told the Herald. The disease is rarely fatal, and is often more of a discomfort. It is transmitted when a mosquito bites an infected person and then bites an uninfected person. It cannot be transmitted directly from human to human. Symptoms include fever, severe joint pain, swelling, rashes, and a feeling similar to arthritis for years, according to the Herald. Previous cases of the disease were the result of travelers having been bitten by infected mosquitoes in the Caribbean, where it is highly-prevalent. It was only a matter of time until it made the jump to Florida. ‘We expected this. Now the question is what are the cases to follow and can Mosquito Control itself do something to mitigate whatever those numbers might be?’ Walter Tabachnick, director of the University of Florida's Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory, told the Herald. Preventive measures: Officials are stepping up the spraying of mosquito-prone areas to reduce their populations . ‘It’s not clear yet, how many more cases are there to follow in addition to these initial cases,’ he explained . Another official told the paper counties will now be spraying more often for mosquitoes. ‘We’re trying to put in our plan on how to be a little more proactive with our spraying,’ Miami-Dade County’s Road, Bridge, Canal and Mosquito Control Division chief Manuel Garcia said. ‘We don’t want to set a concrete plan; we have to come up with an adjustable plan based on the mosquitoes, and adjust the plan routinely.’ Authorities expect more people who became sick from an infected mosquito to eventually come forward, but do not expect a full-on outbreak or epidemic like it has become in some parts of the Caribbean. Reports say thousands of cases have been reported in the Dominican Republic. It has been declared an epidemic in Puerto Rico, where 121 cases have been confirmed, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Property owners in Florida are being encouraged to drain standing water, seal screens and windows, and cover up while outside since the infected insects can bite during both the day and night. The only treatment for chikungunya is acetaminophen and water. Taking aspirin is specifically discouraged because the disease does not react well to it.","Two cases of Chikungunya have been confirmed transmitted within Florida .
The disease is passed from human to human by infected mosquitoes the same way malaria and dengue fever are transmitted .
It causes severe pain, rashes, swelling, nausea and can last for weeks or even years .
Infected humans cannot directly transmit the disease to other humans ."
"By . Ryan Gorman . Two window washers dangling high in the air over the street Thursday morning were rescued by firefighters. The two unidentified men were five stories above an Olympia, Washington street when their window washing platform began to malfunction. One of the workers was bleeding from the head when firefighters arrived. The pair was working on the rear of the six-story building when the mishap occurred, an Olympia Fire Department statement said. It is not clear what caused the incident. Bleeding: One of the window washers suffered a laceration to his head. The other was uninjured in the ordeal . Hanging on for his life: One of the window washers was dangling from the side of the building while the other remained in his window washing perch . Both men, reportedly employees of Ace Window Cleaning, based in Gig Harbor, appeared to be working from seats that were suspended in the air using cables. One of the workers was still in his perch, but another appeared to be dangling from the side of the building when help arrived. Three firefighter crews soon arrived on the scene just after 10.00 a.m., authorities said.One raced to the top of the building to make sure the line was secure and would continue to hold the men. To the rescue: Firefighters raised a ladder up the side of the building to bring the men down . Back down to earth: The other widow washer being rescued . Another worked through the fifth-floor windows to assess the medical condition of the window washers, and a third raised a ladder up the side of the building to bring the duo down. The injured man was helped out of his tangled gear and lowered to the ground for medical attention, according to fire officials. The second worker was brought down shortly after, he suffered no injuries. A person who answered the phone at a number listed for Ace Window Cleaning declined comment and hung up.","The two men were hanging Thursday morning from the side of an Olympia, Washington building .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . Chicago police are searching for two men believed to have beaten a 64-year-old woman and robbed eight others during a brazen Wednesday train heist just before the afternoon rush hour. The two assailants were caught on surveillance video shortly before boarding the downtown-bound Orange Line train, pulled out guns and robbed passengers of their wallets, phones and jewelry as it rolled towards ""The Loop"" just after 4.00 p.m. 'I was the only one they struck,' Romelia Garcia told the Chicago Tribune. 'Incredible. Incredible that this happens in plain day.' Pistol-whipped: Romelia Garcia, 64, was the only person on the train willing to stand up to the thieves, and she paid a price for it . Wanted: These two men are the primary suspects in the brazen daytime robbery . One of two: Police are asking for the public's help to track down this man and his hat-wearing accomplice . Garcia was assaulted when she stood up to the robbers and refused the hand over her purse, authorities said. One of the thieves responded by whacking her in the head with his handgun before bolting off at the next stop, said police. Garcia fortunately suffered only a bruise to head and was able to be treated on the scene while being questioned by police. Investigators have since released security stills they believe are the two men responsible for the heist, which happened after train left Midway International Airport on the city's gritty South Side. They are both black men and believed to be in their 20s, authorities said. One was black and had a neatly trimmed goatee, but other details are scarce at the moment. The photographs show the men leaving the Roosevelt station near the time of a robbery that occurred on the Orange Line between the Halsted and Roosevelt stations. Lt. Ozzie Valdez said Thursday that . some video and interviews with witnesses have led authorities to believe . the two men boarded the train just southwest of downtown Chicago, . brandished their weapons and loudly announced that they were robbing the . people on the train, before going from person to person. Valdez, who called the robbery an 'isolated incident,' said he is confident that the release of the photographs will help . police quickly arrest the suspects, though none have been identified . yet. Caught on camera: This combination of surveillance photos taken July 16, 2014 and released by the Chicago Police Department shows two men on a Chicago Transit Authority train platform that Chicago police are looking for who they say robbed multiple passengers on an Orange Line train at gunpoint . More footage: Police are asking for the public's help in identifying both men . On the run: Both suspects dart out of the Orange Line Roosevelt Station . He also said detectives were still reviewing surveillance video from the train and the platforms for further help identifying the crooks. Miguel Fuentes, the national director of the volunteer-based community patrol group, Guardian Angels, said he also believes arrests will be made because somebody will recognize the suspects. And, he said, that will put commuters, nervous about the brazenness of the robbery, at ease. 'It's completely scary that for two people at 4 o'clock, on a train heading into the city pulling out guns and rob them like they're Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid or something.' He also suggested the robbers would strike again if they were not captured. 'To do it at 4 in the afternoon on a train coming in from Midway Airport into the hub of Chicago… they have no respect for anybody, and if we don’t catch them, and we don’t turn them in, they’re going to do it again,' he told WBBM. Where it happened: The two thieves boarded at Halstead Station and made a run for it at Roosevelt Station, the next stop on the train, authorities said . On the lookout: Guardian Angels are patrolling the city's famed elevated trains handing out wanted fliers in an effort to help capture the two suspects . Another Guardian Angel patrolling the Orange Line in the wake of the frightening thefts told WGN that it is not wise to resist a thief once a gun is brandished. 'Your life is more important than anything you can hold,' he added. The robbery comes as the city deals with a surge in gun violence and has only further frazzled the nerves of the city's millions of people who rely on mass transit. 'I feel like maybe there should be more security now… especially with all the phones people carry now,' a rider told WBBM. 'It’s just really dangerous.' 'We pay our money for the CTA and you have all these cameras, you're charging us extra money and I mean, where was the security at,' Chicagoan Tracy Tucker asked WFLD. Robberies on the CTA have dropped significantly in the last year, the agency said. In the first three months of 2014, nearly 100 people were arrested as a result of images pulled from the CTA cameras, it said. Crime on the city's transit system has also been on a downward this year, the Tribune noted. Thefts between January and March declined 23 per cent when compared to the first quarter of 2013, according to agency statistics. Police have yet to identify the suspects or acknowledge there have been any solid tips leading them closer to any arrests. The investigation remains ongoing.","Romelia Garcia, 64, bravely stood up to the thieves but was pistol-whipped by one of them, police said .

"By . Leesa Smith . and Daniel Mills . Debris from the Soyuz rocket which took off from Kazakhstan on Tuesday is thought to be the bright light burning over Australian skies . The meteor which lit up Australia's night skies on Thursday is now believed to be left over 'space junk' from a Russian weather satellite launched in Kazakhstan. Social media was abuzz with the pictures of the bright object with its long burning tail when it blazed over the skies of Victoria, NSW and Tasmania at 9.45pm on Thursday night. The rare signing saw people deluge social media with claims of the unusual sighting - including drivers who nearly crashed their cars when they stopped on the roadside to watch it. Astronomers now say the object more resembles 'man made' fragments, probably from the Russian weather satellite launched on Tuesday, rather than a meteor. The weather satellite is being used to track cloud cover, storm systems, temperature, humidity, and polar ice movements for the next five years. Scroll down for video . Sydney observatory astronomer Melissa Hulbert said the timing of the last night's space phenomenon matches the timing and location of the rocket's mission. 'It looks like it was the upper-stage of a Soyuz's rocket that was launched a few days ago,' Ms Hulbert told AAP. 'Apparently the tracking and impact prediction matched, time and location, what we saw.' She said the object seen over Australian skies would have been a piece of the rocket designed to fall away as part of the launch of the satellite. 'It's kind of like the Apollo mission,'she said. 'Parts would be dropped off at various points throughout the mission.' The object would have had a diameter of about 3.35m and a length of about 1.5m, she said. Traffic stopped to check out the blazing shooting object on Thursday night . Geosciences Australia is unable to officially confirm the reports but a shooting light blazing across the night skyline in Tasmania, Victoria and NSW at about 9.50pm lit up social media sites . Astronomical Society of Victoria president Ken Le Marquand said the colours reported to have been seen also indicated it was man-made. 'The images I've seen show a lot of different colours,' Mr Le Marquand told AAP. 'When you get lots of colours it usually means there's different materials in there, man-made materials,' he said. 'The fact they saw all these colours in it could indicate it's made of different materials.' Mr Le Marquand also pointed to a Twitter post by Nobel Prize winning Australian National University Astronomer Brian Schmidt. 'So our fireball may well have been a piece of space junk,' Prof Schmidt wrote, linking to data showing the trajectory of meteor decay. Monash astronomer Michael Brown replied that he had had the same idea. 'Space junk crossed my mind too. Travelling close to horizontal and taking a long (time) to burn up,"" he wrote. On Thursday night motorists were so mesmerised by what was believed to be a meteor shooting through the sky that they were almost causing accidents as they were drawn to a complete standstill in the middle of the road. Geosciences Australia were unable to confirm reports of a shooting light blazing across the night skyline. Various photos posted to social media sites had people guessing what the unexplained flying object was. ‘Cars were stopping in the middle of the road’ Heather ‏@I_enigma  tweeted while @Bombergrl2000 posted: ‘me too. daughter came home and told me, she narrowly missed accident, cars were stopping in middle of road.’ There are also many mock shots also doing the rounds on social media, for those who missed out on getting a photo of the possible meteor.","'Meteor' sighting closely matches timing and location of rocket launched from Kazakhstan on Tuesday .

The Du Palais clutch bag, which measures 7in (17cm) by 5in (12cm) and weighs 542g, also comes with a 1,000-year guarantee alongside its £105,000 price tag. It took Mr Shellis and his dedicated team of goldsmiths and diamond setters more than 100 hours to create the bag . Mr Chellis, 48, claims his bling creation is the world’s most expensive clutch bag. But, in fact, the world's most expensive handbag is the Mouawad 1001 Nights Diamond Purse, which is made up of 18ct gold and encrusted with more than 4,500 diamonds. The bejeweled purse costs $3.8 million, earning a place in Guinness World Records in 2010 for being the most valuable handbag in the world. Mr Chellis said of his creation: 'Like all Borgezie creations, the bag is designed to be a true treasure and comes with the usual 1,000-year guarantee - basically, it’ll never break. 'The inspiration and design was drawn from the Buckingham Palace gates. Like the palace gates, it conveys its very own regal presence.

The Buckingham Palace gates inspired the design of the clutch bag . 'It would not look out of place among the collection of the jewels in the Tower of London itself. It could easily be worn by any royal princess. 'The bag is practical and is big enough to hold a purse, make-up or phone - but whoever buys it will probably have staff to hold those items for them.' Earlier this year Chris Shellis created the world's most expensive pair of stilettos which were encrusted with 1,290 diamonds .

"By . Gemma Mullin . David Evans, 23, was working on a country house redevelopment when he was crushed by a two-ton block of limestone . A builder who died while working on a country house redevelopment was crushed to death by a two-ton block of limestone which fell on him because of a 'complete lack of planning', a jury heard today. Stonemason's assistant David Evans, 23, suffered 'catastrophic' injuries to his chest and abdomen when the huge rock fell off its lintel onto him after a crane driver was told to slacken the ropes holding it. Mr Evans was working at the Well Barn Estate, near Moulsford, Oxfordshire, as part of a major renovation at the sprawling £20million home of former Pizza Express director Hugh Osmond. The prosecution described the rock as being like 'an enormous free-standing bathroom tile' but without grouting or anything else to hold it in place. Mr Evans’ employer, Cavendish Masonry Ltd, denies a charge of corporate manslaughter, having been accused of failing to adequately prepare for the operation. The firm has already admitted a charge under health and safety legislation of failing in its responsibility to employees. Mr Evans was pinned to a set of stairs for between five and 20 seconds. He was treated at the scene by colleagues and paramedics before being airlifted to hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Scene: Mr Evans was struck by the huge rock as he worked on the sprawling £20million site (pictured) near Moulsford, Oxfordshire. He was airlifted to hospital with 'catastrophic injuries', but died later the same day . Oliver Glasgow, prosecuting, said: 'The decision had been taken not to use any fixings to hold the stone in place, therefore when the strops [a short rope whose ends are spliced together to make a ring] on the crane were slackened off, the only thing that held it there was its own weight. 'Since it was top-heavy and its width was not uniform and it was balanced on two concrete blocks, it was inevitable it would topple.' He said tests were later carried out on the block and found that because of its irregular shape, it was a matter of millimetres which could decide whether it was stable or not. 'The specialist inspectors from Health and Safety Executive considered the absence of restraint as being very serious,' he said. 'They identified fixing the stones in place before the strops were let off was an essential part of the operation and absence was a significant error. Mr Evans had originally been working on the site as a plumber and was then taken on by Cavendish Masonry Ltd as a stonemason’s mate because he was recognised as being a good worker . Sign: Cavendish Masonry Ltd is due to be sentenced at Oxford Crown Court on a forthcoming date . 'It was concluded this was a result of a complete lack of planning and the work of Cavendish Masonry fell significantly below the standard expected of someone carrying out such a lifting operation. 'It would appear no real thought or planning had gone into the operation itself. 'Cavendish Masonry did almost nothing to ensure the lifting operation was done safely. The dangers it posed were obvious and they had been alerted by an email from the architect.' The crane and its driver, from a local plant hire base, had only been drafted in to the site that morning, Oxford Crown Court heard. At the time of the incident, the masonry team was building a 'rustic wall' above the so-called Mediterranean Steps at the home of former Pizza Express director Hugh Osmond. Their role involved placing large blocks of limestone alongside each other on a pre-prepared concrete lintel, above and to the side of the steps. It was as the second stone was being installed that it fell. The £20million home of former Pizza Express director Hugh Osmond (pictured) was undergoing a major redevelopment . Mr Evans had originally been working on the site as a plumber and was then taken on by Cavendish as a stonemason’s mate because he was recognised as being a good worker. He was working with his site manager, Leroy Muxlow and colleague James Colclough, in placing the limestone pieces on the lintel. Mr Muxlow was directing crane driver Manuel Oliveira and Mr Colclough was on the lintel, while Mr Evans, who had been on the stairs, moved down below the block to try to move it into place. Mr Glasgow told the court: 'When Mr Muxlow appeared happy with the position of the stone he signalled to Mr Oliveira to slacken off. 'According to Mr Oliveira, only seconds after this happened the stone began to topple over onto Mr Evans.' The jury was told that the limestone pieces obtained by Cavendish Masonry were twice as high as the ones envisaged by architect Philip Wagner and had prompted the masonry firm to produce its own drawings to reflect the change. Mr Glasgow said the move prompted Mr Wagner to send an email to Cavendish’s director, Richard Ferris, which read: 'That sounds very promising. How are you going to tie them back to stop them moving forward when back-filled with soil?' There was no reply to that question, the jury heard. Mr Ferris and Mr Wagner had been due to discuss a number of items at the building site at lunchtime on the day that tragedy struck. Yet work had already begun on the rustic wall in the morning of February 9, 2010 and Mr Ferris arrived at the site around the same time as the air ambulance, which was responding to the 999 call made by workers. Mansion: The court heard that Cavendish Masonry Ltd had committed a gross breach in its duty of care in its management and organisation of the work on Mr Osmond's 1,200-acre Well Barn Estate (pictured) The work being done on the 1,200 acre country estate included demolishing the estate manager’s home, a cottage, garages and a barn, replacing it with a new family home. A timber barn was also being converted into an indoor pool, gym and office, with an underground garage. After Mr Evans’ death, Mr Osmond released a statement, saying: 'It is a deeply tragic accident and we are obviously very shocked about it. All our thoughts go out to the man’s family and friends.' The tycoon amassed his estimated £350million fortune through Punch Taverns and Pizza Express. The trial is set to continue.

Chantelle Gough's top job sees her battling for clients in court and working long hours for a medical negligence firm. But she's just as skilled at winning cases as she is at winning cheerleading trophies and has just returned from competing at the World Championships in Florida. As well as being a lawyer Chantelle dedicates her spare time to her cheerleading . Chantelle (right) has just returned from competing at the World Championships in Florida . Chantelle, 27, took up cheerleading aged 16 after years of gymnastics and cheered her way through her degree at the University of Essex. She even set up her own squad the Sparks Elite and her current team the Surrey Starlets were crowned national champions in 2013. Last year she finally achieved her dream of attending the World Championships where her team placed 5th and they were back again for a second time this April. But all the while, Chantelle was living a parallel life as an ambitious young lawyer. Chantelle took up cheerleading aged 16 after years of gymnastics and cheered her way through her degree at the University of Essex . Her dream of working in court as a top level solicitor has finally come true and she now battles to get compensation for people who have suffered from medical negligence. Despite her double life she was anxious about telling some colleagues about her hobby in case they looked down on her unusual extra-curricular activity. Thankfully, most of her workmates couldn't be more understanding, even if they are a bit surprised when she pulls her uniform out of her bag among piles of legal papers and law books. Chantelle, pictured third right with The Surrey Starlets, is rarely without her laptop and phone at practices and competitions . Sparks Elite, the team, which Chantelle set up in East London . Her busy life means Chantelle regularly dashes from court with her trainers under her arm and her backpack over her shoulders on the way to training up to five times a week. Likewise, when at competitions she's rarely without her laptop and phone as she never lets either of her passions take a back seat. Chantelle said: 'It is hard to juggle both sometimes but I couldn't give up either - I love law and cheerleading too much - It's both my dreams come true at once. Chantelle often has to switch quickly between cheerleading and her job as a lawyer . 'If I'm court the next day I often come back from training and then end up working in the breaks or late at night when I get in but it's worth it. 'I often have to switch quickly between the two. 'Sometimes it will be as quick a transformation as taking a witness statement or leaning over to counsel to give instructions one minute, and changing into my trainers the next. 'Most people at work know about my secret hobby but people were very sceptical at the beginning. 'I didn't tell some of the partners because I didn't want to be put in the bimbo box, but I'm proud to be showing that cheerleaders care more about the skimpy outfits and the fake tan. 'It's very athletic and I've had everything from broken fingers to bruised cheeks doing the lifts and tumbles that make up our routines. 'Although if I could run around in trainers all day that would be great but instead it's heels and a black suit for my 9-to-5 and then my purple sparkly cheer uniform.'","Chantelle Gough started cheerleading at age 16 after doing gymnastics .

The 45-year-old actress looks stunning on the box of the new scent, which comes in an azure blue bottle. With her hair teased into slightly damp tresses and a sun-kissed glow, Jennifer captures the beach babe look perfectly. J by Jennifer Aniston, the second scent by the actress, is a crisp light fragrance . J by Jennifer Aniston is a clean rather than sweet scent designed for the summer. Aniston told People: ‘My debut fragrance is a clean, feminine perfume — it reminds me of the way you smell when you just arrive at the beach: fresh, with a touch of sunblock and sand. ‘This new fragrance is its complement. It has a hint of that salty sea smell that reminds me of a day spent in the ocean. It’s relaxed and refreshing.’ Her debut scent Lolavie was launched three years ago and has notes of citrus grove accord, rose water and jasmine. Rumoured to be on the cusp of marrying her fiance of 23 months Justin Theroux, Jennifer's summer looks set to be jam-packed as she promotes both her new scent and her latest movie Horrible Bosses 2 in which she plays a nymphomaniac employer from hell.

Despite this, Justin told Extra at the New York premiere of his new HBO series The Leftovers on Monday, that despite rumours their long engagement means they are getting cold feet about tying the knot, they have 'hot feet'.

"By . Katy Winter . A woman says she is over the moon to be back with her childhood sweetheart after spending more than 25 years apart from him. Debbie Dennis, 48, met the 'love of her life', Tim Dennis, 47, at her local youth club in Croydon when the pair were both 14 years old. After a brief relationship, during which the teenaged couple became engaged, the pair hit a bump in the road and they broke up. The pair dated for years as teenagers (left), even getting engaged when they were 18, but were only actually married in 2012, 31 years to the day that the couple first met (right, pictured recently) Both went on to develop lives of their own and marry other people but when they both found themselves single again 25 years later, a chance encounter would lead them back into each others’ arms. The couple are now married, nearly three decades after they broke up. Mrs Dennis, a healthcare assistant and author from Blackpool, said: 'Thinking back, I regretted breaking up with Tim as soon as I said the words. It was a moment of madness - one I often returned to, even though I later made a completely separate life from him. 'I’m so happy that we’re back together now.' Mr and Mrs Dennis first met in June 1981 when she was introduced to him by a friend at youth club. Mrs Dennis said: 'I’d known of him because we went to the same school. He was too shy to ask me out so his friend did instead. He was very interesting with his blue rolled-up jeans, Dr Martens and shaved head. Even after 25 years apart, the pair still thought of each other and were eventually reintroduced through Tim's sister . 'It was very exciting. He was grinning at me with a cheeky smile. 'I knew fairly quickly that he was the one for me.' The couple began a four-year relationship and became engaged when they turned 18 years old. But as time went on, Mrs Dennis became fed up by Mr Dennis’ habit of spending time with his friends rather than her. She said: 'I decided to give him an ultimatum. I told him love me or leave me - that unless he spent more time with me and kept the dates we made, I would break it off with him. 'It was a gamble on my part. I didn’t really want to break up with him, and I thought by giving him a shock it would bring him closer to me. 'Unfortunately, the plan backfired and he broke up with me. I was completely gutted.' As the years went by, both went their separate ways and eventually lost contact all together. Mrs Dennis went on to marry in February 1992 and had a daughter, now 28. Mr Dennis would also marry and have a son, now 19, a daughter, 24, and three stepdaughters. By 2009 Mrs Dennis’s marriage had come to end and she found her thoughts returning to her childhood sweetheart. She said: 'Even while I was married I’d wondered what Tim was doing. I knew I’d always regretted splitting up with him. I wished I’d never let him go. The couple began regularly dating and in 2010 Tim moved from his shared house in south London to live with Debbie in Blackpool . 'I would return to the adventures we’d . had when we were teenagers. We’d had a dream of moving to the Isle of . Wight and had been on a few trips there. We once disturbed a wasp nest and had to run into the sea together to escape the wasps. 'We were young and daft and the memories from those days made me smile when I was feeling low.' Shortly . after her separation Mrs Dennis discovered that Mr Dennis’s sister was . on the social networking site Friends Reunited, and they struck up a . friendship. Mrs Dennis said: . 'One afternoon I asked her what she was doing that day, and she . mentioned that she was going off to Tim’s birthday barbeque. 'He was house-sharing with a friend at that time. I discovered that he’d been married but his relationship had come to an end and in fact he had been single for 11 years. 'I asked her to wish him a happy birthday from me and left it at that.' To her surprise, Mr Dennis sent her a text message the following day. Mrs Dennis said: 'His sister must have passed on my number. The text read:‘thanks for the birthday message’. I was in a hurry, so rather grumpily replied: ‘who’s this?’ 'The reply came back: ‘Someone from over 25 years ago - take a guess’. The pair say they feel lucky to have been given a second chance to be together . 'When I realised who it was, I had butterflies in my stomach. We began chatting and he said the next time I was in the south, we should go for dinner.' The couple began regularly dating and in 2010 Mr Dennis moved from his shared house in south London to live with her in Blackpool. She said: 'We’d never lived together before, so it was a strange thing to get used to, but we’ve been blissfully happy ever since.' on June 9th 2012, 31 years to the day that the couple first met, they finally wed. Mrs Dennis said: 'It was an incredible day but things didn’t exactly go according to plan. Firstly, my horse and carriage couldn’t make its way to the service because there was a gay pride march along the route. 'I called a taxi but someone jumped into it before I could reach it. I ended up running across some tramlines in my wedding dress, as people looked on. I almost fell flat on my face. 'It was almost as if fate was trying to keep us apart again, but I fought to get there on time. 'By the time I got to the service I was so hysterical that I couldn’t stop laughing. The two of us giggled all the way through the wedding. It was a wonderful, unusual day.' Mr Dennis, who works at a biscuit factory, said: 'I was nervous about moving up to live with Debbie at first, of course, but since then life has been amazing. We’re very happy together. 'We both consider ourselves very lucky to have been given a second chance.'","Mr and Mrs Dennis first met in June 1981 at a Croydon youth club .

'I felt upset because I didn’t want to lose him. I was worried that he was going to start looking elsewhere. 'I was not happy at the time but now I look back and know it was a case of being cruel to be kind.' Mrs Hammond-Moore and her husband Jonathan Moore, 31, a manager of a scrap company, have been a couple for 10 years and wed in 2011. Together they have two children, daughter Ruby,  eight, and son Alistair, five. Mr Moore said: 'I do a lot of fitness. I go to the gym and play football, so that affected my view of things.' Mrs Hammond-Moore’s weight crept up to 15st following the birth of her son in 2009. At her heaviest weight she was wearing size 20 clothes. Mr Moore said: 'When I first met Stacey ten years ago she was just over 10st. She was slim, and very active. 'When she was larger she seemed so depressed every day. I could tell how uncomfortable she was by it all.' As her weight piled on, Mrs Hammond-Moore began experiencing breathlessness and lost confidence in her body image. She . said: 'I was too ashamed to take my children swimming because I was . worried about what I would look like in a bathing suit. I was concerned . that if I took the kids to a theme park, I would get stuck on the . rides.' After . her husband’s comments, which he made in 2008, she began thinking about . how her weight was affecting her and went about changing her lifestyle.

Mr Moore says he is very proud of Stacey's weight loss  (right with her Slimming World award) Now she is following the Slimming World diet and on a normal day, will eat lean bacon on wholemeal bread, salads and low fat bolognaises and curries. She has also ditched the multipack crisps and eats fruits and yoghurts instead. Mrs Hammond-Moore is now 10st 7lb and feels much more confident in her size 10 clothes. She said: 'I love my new figure. I’ve transformed myself to the point where people don’t recognise me.' 'By changing my diet to healthier options it’s better for the kids, as they share the food too.' In March 2014 her husband treated her to a boudoir photoshoot to allow her to show off her new body. She said: 'The photos have given me much more confidence. The compliments I’ve had from people have been out of this world.” Mr Moore said: 'She has done extremely well. She is nearly back to the size she was when I met her. I’m extremely proud, to lose 4st overall is very impressive. I can’t fault her at all now, she looks absolutely beautiful.' Mrs Hammond-Moore added: 'Jonathan wouldn’t dream of telling me I’m too fat now. In fact, he loves to show me off. 'It was hurtful at the time, but now I know how much better my life is.

When former X Factor judge Tulisa appeared in court last fortnight for a hearing related to allegations that she arranged a drug deal, concern over the singer's face, which appeared noticeably puffy and swollen, was raised. Though she has previously denied having . had a nose job and lip fillers, the former N-Dubz star's face was markedly different to . the fresh-faced girl who burst onto the pop music scene in 2007. But 25-year-old Tulisa may have offered an explanation. In his Metro column, The Green Room, Neil Sean writes that the singer has denied having had any cosmetic work done, claiming: 'It is all down to clever make-up.' Scroll down for video . New look: When former N-Dubz star Tulisa Contostavlos arrived at court last fortnight, she showcased a new look, which she says is all down to clever make-up . New make-up bag? The difference between Tulisa's face between 2009 (left) and 2014 (right) is striking . And those in the beauty know claim she could be telling the truth. Celebrity make-up artist Mikey Phillips believes Tulisa's dramatic new look could well be down to her new beauty regime. Speaking about Tulisa's face, which appeared slightly 'pulled back' and swollen a few weeks ago, he said: 'Tulisa's make-up has really changed since her early days. 'Now she goes for a heavily contoured look to slim the face and add shape. She also contours her nose, which again slims and adds dimension. 'How you contour your face can totally have a dramatic change to your face. Concealer can be used to lift and brighten and bronzer to shade and define. 'Lip liner and lip plumping products could be responsible for the plumper pout but remember make-up is all smoke and mirrors.' The power of the brush: A celebrity make-up artist believes that Tulisa now goes for a heavily contoured look to slim the face and add shape. She also contours her nose, which again slims and adds dimension, he says . The singer has persistently denied having any form of plastic surgery and was keen to hide her plumped-up pout as she left a beauty salon in Central London in October last year. In August last year, she also put her slimmer looking nose down to the fact she had lost weight. She told the Mirror at the time: 'It's not a deliberate thing, and I really don't give a toss about being skinny. That's just not me. But when I lose weight it goes from my face, and everyone says my nose looks thinner. 'I swear on my life I've not had it done. I've literally just lost weight, and it goes from my nose!' Annemarie Gillett, Non Surgical Director from Transform Cosmetic Surgery, isn't convinced. She said: ‘Looking at the photos provided, Tulisa definitely looks like she has had some kind of temporary dermal filler to her lips and is a very popular treatment with women of Tulisa’s age. Tulisa’s lips looked thinner in earlier pictures. Was it all down to the products? Mikey believes that lip liner and lip plumping products could be responsible for Tulisa's plumper pout . 'The elongated and shiny forehead is a classic tell-tale sign of having injectable wrinkle treatment. 'Her cheeks also look fuller than in earlier photographs. 'Her skin looks quite taut and shiny which would suggest Tulisa has had regular facial peels/skin rejuvenation treatments. 'It appears Tulisa has indulged in non-surgical treatments of late. However Tulisa is very young and less is more and I would encourage using less product and leaving more time in between treatments.' Cosmetic and plastic surgeon, Paul Banwell FRCS (Plast) from the Banwell Clinic says: 'I think Tulisa looks great but I can see the tell-tale signs of Botox, fillers in her lips and possibly in her cheeks too. 'She looks like she’s lost a bit of weight in her face as well which has made her lips look more sensuous and striking.'

"By . Ryan Lipman . As many as 25 African delegates who were in Melbourne for the 20th International AIDS Conference are in crisis accommodation after refusing to leave Australia. The five-day conference finished on July 25 and delegates from countries including Tanzania are now seeking asylum in Australia, while their visas have reportedly expired or are due to imminently. One of the delegates, who preferred to remain anonymous, said his work with people with HIV and albinos in his native Tanzania had put his life at risk after, reported the ABC. Scroll down for video . About 25 African International AIDS Conference delegates are seeking asylum in Australia . Tanzania has one of the highest rates of albino murders in the world, often a result of witchcraft killings. Receiving death threats, the delegate said he was nearly killed by a group of people who chased him as he drove home from watching soccer game. 'So I got a very bad accident ... almost like dying. They wanted to kill me. After that crash, they disappeared completely because so many people came to give me help,' he said. Believing the Tanzanian Government will not be able to protect his safety or similar incidents from happening, the delegate plans to lodge his asylum application later this month. Pamela Curr of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre confirmed the group of delegates was seeking advice about gaining refugee protection in Australia . He said he decided to seek asylum in Australia due to its human rights 'reputation'. A spokesperson of Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said the government would asses each claim for protection based on individual merit and in compliance with the law. Pamela Curr of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said the group of delegates was getting advice about gaining refugee protection in Australia, because they come from countries where AIDS-related work had put their lives at risk. 'It seems that some of them have been considering whether they think they can survive in their countries of origin, or whether they should try to survive by getting refugee protection in Australia,' she said. She said the delegates' visas had either already expired or were due to and that it was not the first time conference delegates have tried to gain refugee status in Australia. 'When people have come from countries where their daily lives are threatened by violence and politics, and they come to Australia and take a deep breath, walk down the street, and know that no one is going to kill them. It's a very intoxicating freedom,' she said. Ms Curr said this is not the first time conference delegates had tried to get asylum in Australia . Ms Curr said this is not the first time conference delegates had tried to get asylum in Australia and that in the past, delegates had been granted asylum because their claims were considered strong under refugee protection. Calling a refugee visa one of the 'hardest' to get in Australia, she said the current delegate's claims would be assessed as per the refugee convention. If found to have a claim, Ms Carr said she wants to see protection offered to the delegates by the government. Crisis accommodation service HomeGround CEO Heather Holst said the organisation had helped find shelter for 14 of the delegates after they sought help. She said while the organisation was not involved in the asylum seeking process, they could provide support with finding a place to stay.","About 25 African International AIDS Conference delegates are seeking asylum in Australia .

Scared: Rebekah Coleman (pictured) said the animal 'showed no fear at all' Another Twitter user, Allison, posted: 'Sad to hear that Peoria police shot and killed a mountain lion. Of course it was aggressive - it was probably scared.' Randy Babb from the AGFD told ABC: 'When you have a cat out in daylight acting odd like this, that's a big red flag. 'They're the things we always look for in disease cases - to see if the animal is behaving oddly. 'Often times when you get an animal that strays into a neighborhood, we will capture it and remove it.' In this case they did not attempt to capture the animal and Mr Babb says the mountain lion might have had rabies. 'Some of these animals will not display rabies for over a year, even though they're carrying the disease.' Mr Babb says he supports the authorities decision to kill the animal and said it was a potential threat to residents. Residents say they've seen bobcats before in the area but not mountain lions.

"By . Alex Sharp . Heather Watson was broken seven times as she was dumped out of the first round of the Baku Cup by France's Kristina Mladenovic. Watson, the British No 1 who was seeded seventh in Azerbaijan, was in action for the first time since falling to Angelique Kerber in the second round at Wimbledon but it was to prove an unsuccessful return for the 22-year-old as she slumped to a 6-2 3-6 6-0 loss. Things started badly for Watson, now 57 in the world rankings, as Mladenovic raced into a 3-0 lead and the unseeded Frenchwoman, who reached the semi-finals in Istanbul last week, broke for a second time to clinch the first set. Already out: Watson went down 6-2, 3-6, 6-0 to unseeded Kristina Mladenovic, losing her first match back on the tour since a second round defeat at Wimbledon to Angelique Kerber . The second set was a topsy-turvy affair which included six service breaks - four of them to Watson as the world No 57 levelled up the match at 1-1. Watson, who had won two of her previous four matches with Mladenovic but was beaten in their last meeting in France two years ago, would have hoped to kick on for victory from there but she was broken three more times in the final set to suffer a convincing loss. Disappointment: The 22-year-old has suffered with injuries and glandular fever in the past two seasons but has made an impressive comeback in 2014, winning the WTA Prague title and rising to 57 in the women's rankings .","Watson falls to 6-2, 3-6, 6-0 loss to world No 81, Kristina Mladenovic .

"By . Ryan Lipman . A holistic approach which sees face-to-face consultations with specially trained experts is behind the success of this year's CSIRO diet. The CSIRO Simply Well diet book is the most successful weight-loss book in Australia and now in its 9th year, people can visit their local chemist to sign up to its Impromy Health and Weight Management Program. As part of the program, experts are on-hand to check, guide and support people through their weight-loss journey in a pharmacy setting, reported Channel 9's A Current Affair. Scroll down for video . The diet program features face-to-face consultations and testing to provide feedback on cholesterol and blood sugar levels . The program is designed to keep people focused on losing weight and has been hailed a success by the people it has help shed tens of kilograms . Adelaide CSIRO professor Manny Noakes was involved one-year of testing the program at laboratories and pharmacies. She said there were a range of positive results for people on the program. 'People really do see very immediate changes to their blood pressure and blood cholesterol even in the first couple of weeks,' she said. 'That can be very motivating for people.' Adelaide CSIRO professor Manny Noakes said the diet and program offered real results for people trying to lose weight . Designed to keep people focused on losing weight, the program is being hailed a success by the people it has help shed tens of kilograms.

She said called the results 'beautiful' and said it had given her more energy than what she previously had. 'You feel good about yourself,' Rhonda said. During the program, participants are tested to check their progress and to give them current feedback by measuring cholesterol and blood sugar levels and guiding clients through the stages of the program. 'You can't do it alone, people do need the support of someone who's trained and can help motivated them,' Ms Noakes said. 'This isn't about wielding a stick over people - it's about helping them through that journey and making them feel empowered in the process.' Other new elements of the diet are scientifically-formulated shakes and soups used as breakfast or lunch meal replacements as well as snacks.

"By . Ryan Lipman . Super-fit aerobics instructor Joe Houpapa has died two days after he hit his head while running with young son . A well-known New Zealand gym instructor has died two days after falling and hitting his head while jogging with his young sons. On Sunday, Joe Houpapa was running when he collapsed and sustained a head injury. He later died early Tuesday morning. The 40-year-old father-of-four was jogging with his young sons Luca and Le Bron, who are both at primary school, at about 4pm when he fell, reported The New Zealand Herald. A personal trainer and instructor of 20 years at Les Mills gym in Victoria Park, Auckland, he was super-fit at the time of his death. Teaching body pump and combat classes, these helped keep him in peak physical condition. The gym general manager Jackie Marshall the circumstances around the death were still unclear. 'He suffered a massive head trauma through the fall but nobody knows what caused the fall,' she said. 'He was jogging behind his two boys, and when they turned around their dad was on the ground.' It is yet to be determined if Mr Houpapa simply tripped or was suffering from an underlying medical condition but Ms Marshall said a post-mortem would shed more light on this. The 40-year-old had been a personal trainer and instructor at an Auckland gym for 20 years . During his two-decade career with the gym, Mr Houpapa taught other Les Mills instructors internationally, Ms Marshall said. 'He's probably one of the most loved (trainers) around,' she said and added his two passions in life were his family and Les Mills. The popular trainer leaves behind his partner Trish, teenage daughter Kiana and preschooler Eden, who along with his two sons, are all  struggling to come to terms with the death, Ms Marshall said. A memorial service was held for the trainer yesterday. The Les Mills Facebook page posted about the devastating loss on Tuesday. 'Today we sadly farewell Joe Houpapa. A dearly loved and respected member of the Les Mills tribe. Our hearts go out to his family and friends at this tragic time,' the post reads. 'Joe, you will be sorely missed but never forgotten.' The popular personal trainer leaves behind a partner and four children . Peopled commented about their sadness at his death including Yvette Skogstad-Archer who wrote: 'RIP Joe. You were my favorite instructor. Love and thoughts to all of his Family, Les Mills family and friends.' A Givealittle fund has been set up by the gym to help support Mr Houpapa's family and as of Thursday night nearly $44,000 had been raised. 'His (Joe's) absence will be sorely felt by all his colleagues, clients, and members of Les Mills,' the fundraising page reads. 'We have set up this fund as many people have approached us asking how they can donate to support Joe's partner Trish and their children. 'All money raised will help Joe's partner, Trish, and their children as they go through this incredibly tough time in their lives.'","New Zealand fitness instructor died two days after hitting his head .

"By . Ryan Lipman . Glen Turner was shot and killed on a property near Moree in northern NSW over an environmental dispute . The family of a 79-year-old Moree wheat farmer charged with murdering a state government worker said he had 'crumbled' under the pressure of an impending court battle over illegal land clearing. Glen Turner was trying to issue Ian Robert Turnbull a notice for illegally chopping down trees on Tuesday. 'A man was pushed beyond what he would have probably thought in his entire life he was ever capable of,' said members of Turnbull's family, who asked not to be named, reported The Daily Telegraph. The family member said Mr Turnbull's one-year battle with the NSW Department of Environment and Heritage and the constant flow on inspectors on the property had encompassed his life and even affected his health. The farmer was suffering depression, insomnia, high blood pressure and required a pacemaker as a result. Mr Turnbull was refused bail on Wednesday and appeared at Moree Local court later in the day. Mr Turner, 51, was working for the department and is survived by his wife Alison and their two children, aged nine and 10. Mr Turnbull had previously been served notices by Mr Turner for illegally clearing vegetation on his property and in the Croppa Creek area. The Land and Environment Court had ordered the farmer to remediate the land after it found the Native Title Vegetation Act had been breached. Scroll down for video . The state government worker was shot as he served a notice to an elderly man accused of illegally chopping down trees in the Croppa Creek area . In the wake of the tragedy, Mr Turnbull's family hope to see the legislation changed so farmers have more control over how they clear their land after persistent calls from farming communities. The family member said Mr Turnbull was the 'respected elder' who people into the community turned too and not a 'hermit'. 'He was out in the community - he was helping to build old people's homes, he was collecting trampolines at school fetes, he did Meals on Wheels,' the family member told The Daily Telegraph. 'He has held this all in, he has crumbled, he has tried to carry this all to himself.' The Turnbulls said the tragedy had catastrophic impacts for both families and offered their condolences to the Turners. They added that the death was not right and Mr Turner's children had been robbed of their father. Police and paramedics were called to a Croppa Creek property about 55 kilometres north of Moree on the Newell Highway, where they found the body of the victim late on Tuesday afternoon. A post-mortem will be held to determine exactly how the 51-year-old died. He was informing Mr Turnbull that there would be a formal inspection of his property in relation to the suspected illegally clearing of vegetation before the incident occurred. Another worker was with the victim when he was shot, a department source who did not wish to be named said. The other worker is understood to be in shock but is otherwise uninjured. Friends of the alleged shooter have described Mr Turnbull as even-tempered but admitted the whole town knew that he had cleared too many trees. The wheat farmer owned five properties in the area and the shooting took place about a kilometre from one of those. Moree Plains Shire mayor Katrina Humphries said the shooting highlighted the volatile issue of land clearing in northern NSW. The 79-year-old Moree man who was arrested at a nearby property had been served previous notices for illegal clearing on his land and around the Croppa Creek area (pictured) Environmental issues including land clearing and coal seam gas exploration have been a source of frustration in the rural community, she said. 'This is why I say, and I am not saying it flippantly and I mean it, I am not surprised this has happened,' she said. 'Because I know people have been pushed and pushed and pushed. This is their life and this is their livelihood,' Ms Humphries said. Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce agreed with these comments, and said this was a tragedy but not an isolated incident, just the worst one. Northern NSW ecologist Phil Spark said the farmer had cleared about 100 hectares of land. 'And a lot of that is koala habitat so that has been a real conflict between conservation and this farmer having the right to clear his land,' he told ABC Radio. The NSW Public Service Association says the tragedy highlights the need for better risk assessment. 'The protection of the environment is an issue that generates great passion with strong feelings on both sides of the argument,' acting general secretary Steve Turner said in a statement. NSW Environment Minister Rob Stokes said he was deeply saddened by the death.

"By . Ryan Lipman . The head coach of Australia's athletics team has been suspended indefinitely for slamming the country's biggest track and field star, plunging the team into a 'crisis of unprecedented proportions'. Eric Hollingsworth launched an extraordinary attack on Olympic champion Sally Pearson on the eve of her Commonwealth Games 100m hurdles title defence. He said Pearson had set a 'bad example' as team captain by declining to attend a pre-Games training camp in Gateshead, England. Athletics Australia said on Thursday morning: 'We condem in the strongest terms his disparaging comments about Sally Pearson and his timing'. Scroll down for video . Australian athletics head coach Eric Hollingsworth has called track and field star Sally Pearson a bad example after she missed a pre-Commonwealth Games training camp . 'He acted without the authority of Athletics Australia and in contravention of the specific instructions of the chief executive officer,' a statement given to ABC added. They confirmed they have suspended Hollingsworth until the board can consider the matter. Hollingsworth said of Pearson: 'What's lost here is she's the team captain and there's a reasonable expectation she'd be in the camp ahead of something as major as the Commonwealth Games. 'Her no-show sets a bad example to the entire national team.' Hollingsworth also defended his right to criticise Pearson's inability to defend the world indoors 60m hurdles title in March, after which their relationship broke down completely. The comments about Pearson have sent Australian Athletics into a crisis . Former Commonwealth Games track and field medallist David Culbert said the comments had sparked a 'crisis of unprecedented proportions' The comments have caused outrage among Australia's biggest sporting identities who are rallying behind Pearson. Former Commonwealth Games track and field medallist David Culbert said the comments had sparked a 'crisis of unprecedented proportions', reported The Australian. 'I've seen plenty of stuff before in Australian athletics in the last two decades or so but this is the top of the tree I reckon,' he said. 'Having a head coach who leaks his statement on behalf of himself, when competition is underway, describing Sally Pearson, who everyone admires, as being a bad example is one of the most extraordinary things I have ever seen. 'If Eric Hollingsworth is still an employee of Athletics Australia or a member of the Australian Commonwealth Games team by the end of the day then I think the ramifications will continue.' Pearson's manager Robert Joske confirmed on Twitter that the 27-year-old was ignoring the fiasco caused by the controversial comments. 'Sally is not following the drama! She is concentrating on her prep... Professional!', he tweeted. Pearson's coach Robert Joske took to Twitter to say the track and field star was focusing on her games campaign . Nova Peris, the first Aboriginal Australian to win an Olympic gold medal, has slammed Hollingsworth's comments as a 'disgraceful attack' and called Pearson an inspiration and a leader on Twitter. Support for Pearson has also come from former U.S Olympic sprinter Michael Johnson, who weighed in by telling Channel 10 the timing of the comments was 'out of bounds'. He added that Pearson would be able to remain unaffected in the lead up to her games campaign. 'When she's competing I don't think that anything else that happens on the planet really matters to her other than what's going on in the race. So I don't think this will affect her, but that's not the point,' he said. 'The point is that you don't make the comment the day before the competition. I think that was just absolutely out of bounds and it could affect an athlete, and it could affect Sally. I don’t think it will, but I think that should have been taken into consideration before the statement was released.' There are now calls for Commonwealth Games chef de mission Steve Moneghetti to try and stop the athletics team's derailing before its campaign starts. Nova Peris also took to Twitter to rally behind the track star following the 'disgraceful attack' International and Australian track and field athletes have responded to the comments including former U.S sprinter Michael Johnson, pictured left, and former Australian Olympian Nova Peris, pictured right . Senior Athletics Australia officials are also furious with the timing and nature of Hollingsworth's comments. The body has distanced itself by stating the comments do not reflect the views of Athletics Australia (AA). 'This statement was not made on behalf of Athletics Australia but by Hollingsworth as an individual and in no way should it be read as the opinion of Athletics Australia,' AA chief executive Dallas O'Brien said in a statement. 'Given Hollingsworth's current role as a head coach of athletics on the Australian Commonwealth Games Team, we will be meeting with the Australian Commonwealth Games Association urgently to formulate a strong response, as is appropriate.' Senior AA executives were locked in an emergency meeting with Australian Commonwealth Games Association officials on Wednesday to decide whether Hollingsworth's position with the Games team remained tenable. Hollingsworth made the comments on the eve of Pearson's 100m hurdles title defence . Hollingsworth's contract with AA runs out at the conclusion of the Games. Pearson was furious that she was fined by AA for not attending the pre-Games training camp after deciding she would be better served by competing at an extra meet in London, having had her preparation interrupted by a hamstring injury. Hollingsworth also took issue with claims from Pearson's camp that she had received less medical support from AA than had been the case in the past. 'We've had a team physio travelling with Sally for the past three months, following her around Europe,' he said. 'Since May we've provided this service, and there may have been one day or so where there's been an overlap when we've changed over personnel. Senior Athletics Australia officials are angry about the timing and nature of Hollingsworth's comments . 'To say we've withdrawn support is factually incorrect and a little disappointing.' Hollingsworth said he felt compelled to speak out due to what he said was as 'a negative and incorrect picture of the events leading up to the Commonwealth Games'. He insisted he asked 'legitimate questions' of Pearson after she was beaten into second place by American Nia Ali in the defence of her world indoor title in Poland. 'She didn't like the line I was taking,' said Hollingsworth. 'So via her agent she (sought) a meeting with Athletics Australia's president, CEO and High Performance Director, which I was not aware of until the day of, or day before the meeting. Pearson was fined by Australian athletics for not attending the pre-Games training camp . 'While I thought at the time it was curious that I wasn't involved in that process in any form, Sally raised her issues, and the powers-that-be found no problems with my actions, and there was no case to answer. 'Subsequently Sally dug her heels in, as is her right, and asked for what is a new athlete performance advisor which is the conduit between the athletes and Athletics Australia.' Hollingsworth said that was the role he played with most athletes, but he had no issue with it being re-assigned to high performance director Simon Nathan in Pearson's case. 'We had a good working relationship for nearly a decade, but she decided my challenging style wasn't what she was looking for, which is her prerogative,' he said.","Australian athletics head coach Eric Hollingsworth criticised Sally Pearson .

"By . Ryan Lipman . Getting back to nature resulted in Sydney photographer David Stefanoff bringing some of Australia's most recognisable faces to life by projecting them onto trees and rocks. 'The photographic journey was a way of getting away from the computer and into Sydney parks,' Stefanoff told Daily Mail Australia. 'A photo is the finished product but there's everything else between - this was a way to spend a lot of time reconnecting with nature.' Bringing nature to life: Sydney photographer creates stunning portraits using trees as a backdrop . The collection of faces in the series were complied of Stefanoff's idols and people he respects, including  co-founder of fashion label Alpha-60 Georgie Cleary, pictured left, and skateboarder James McInnes . While almost all of the portraits were projected onto trees, one of the most recognisable faces in the series, that of TV host Andrew Denton, appeared on a giant piece of coastal rock between Bondi and Tamarama in Sydney's eastern suburbs . The 39-year-old Bondi-based artist's early experiments with projections were inspired by Sydney's Vivid festival and resulted in the spectacular series called Photosynthesis. 'Projecting onto a tree was an accident,' he said. 'It was one of the different surfaces I was trying and I ended up liking it because the trees, the shape you get when you project portraits, fill up the tree.' But the stunning photographic transformations all started in the same way, with some of Stefanoff's idols agreeing to be photographed in black and white images taken in a studio. Among the famous faces embedded in the natural forms during dusk and night include are media personality Dr Karl Kruszelnicki, TV presenter Andrew Denton, Triple J radio presenter Zane Rowe as well as a mix of fashion designers, tattooists, skateboarders and musicians. Media personality Dr Karl Kruszelnicki's face was brought to life in tree in suburban Sydney . Titled Photosynthesis, the series features lawyer and mother Katarina Ruszczyk, pictured left, and co-founder of fashion label Alpha-60, Alex Cleary . A Norfolk pine in Lennox Head on the NSW north coast was able to give form and depth to model and photographer Catie Allen's portrait . 'They are the people I admire and regard,' the photographer said of his portrait subjects. Stefanoff used a long exposure technique to capture the projections. 'Depending on what you project on, it picks up the colour and texture of the surface,' he said. Trees were Stefanoff's preferred object to project onto and created more natural and organic forms compared to rocks. 'I wanted the people to look like them,' he said. 'It's quite an abstract portrait so it helps to have recognisable faces so people can spot people they know and go ""wow I've seen that person before, they look different"".' 'You see familiar faces in a different context and for subjects who are often photographed, it shows them differently from normal.' Designer Terry Gillespie said he was happy to be involved in the series and was pleased with the finished result after seeing his profile projected onto bush in North Bondi . Circus performer Lil Tulloch, pictured left, blends into a large pine tree on a bright night in Rose Bay in Sydney's east, pictured left, while journalist Leila McKinnon becomes part of a tree in Lennox Head . Triple J radio presenter Zan Rowe's portrait is illuminated by trees in Rose Bay . Many of the locations Stefanoff chose to project the portraits are also recognisable, including spots in Centennial Park in Sydney and coastal rocks between Bondi and Tamarama in Sydney's eastern suburbs, close to where the artist's home. Stefanoff also took images at Lennox Head on the NSW north coast while visiting family and areas in Sydney's eastern suburbs, where he regularly goes for evening walks. 'That's how I got kick started,' he said. Sydney web designer and developer Terry Gillespie was featured in the series and said he loved the finished result. 'I was pretty happy to be involved... I had seen some of his other work,' Mr Gillespie said. Stefanoff said his work's name Photosynthesis was a play on words, as trees normally turn light into energy, but he was using light to create an image. Stefanoff uses the textures of the trees to give the portraits depth and an organic feel, including that storyteller and performer Jane Tyrrell, projected onto palm trees in Bondi .

"By . Ryan Lipman . Ryan Leo was hit and killed by a car in Hurstville in Sydney's south on Monday . The Sydney mother of a six-year-old boy killed after being hit car has made an emotional tribute to her son. 'In heaven there is no traffic, mummy loves you forever,' Zhen Zhen posted online, reported the Sydney Morning Herald. Ryan Leo was on his way to his martial arts class when he was hit by an oncoming car on Durham St, Hustville, in Sydney's south on Monday afternoon. Paramedics were called to the scene about 4.40pm and Ryan died in St George Hospital two hours later after suffering ­severe head and chest injuries. He was with his aunt when he broke free from her and took about 'three steps on to the road' a police spokesman said. The Year 1 Oatley Public School student was flung metres into the air when he was struck by the car - just outside the the Boy Scout Club where he attended his tae kwon do classes, reported the Daily Telegraph. The female driver stopped after the crash underwent mandatory testing. Speed and alcohol were not factors in the accident, a police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia. Employees from nearby businesses rushed to the accident scene where they tried to revive the young boy, who was still in the middle of the road. A six-year-old boy was killed outside Boys Scout Club in Hurstville, Sydney's south, on Monday afternoon . Ryan's tae kwon do headmaster Incheol Yoo said the road where the young boy was killed was 'dangerous' and that speeding was often an issue. In May he petitioned Hurstville City Council about the safety risks and later that month was advised by the council that the matter had been referred for investigation to the council's senior traffic engineer. The council has called the death a 'tragic accident' but will not be commenting further until a report for the coroner was completed. 'It should be noted that council received a petition in mid-May 2014 and council officers have prepared a report relating to parking issues on this street for council to consider at its meeting on August 6.' Teaching at the Durham St Scout hall for 24 years, Mr Yoo said a recent residential development nearby had created havoc for people trying to find a spot to park their cars. Mr Yoo said he was struggling to come to terms with the shock death. 'He (Ryan) was a good boy, a lovely boy. It's very sad,' he said of his pupil. The headmaster said the young boy's parents recently had another child and this might have been the reason why his aunt drove him to class. Mr Yoo did not see the accident because he was teaching when it happened, but said one of his teenage students did but said the martial arts school looked after its students. Ryan started going to the tae kwon do school last February and already had a yellow belt. It is believed the boy was on his way to his martial arts class when he broke away from his aunt when he ran onto the road . The tragic accident happened in front of Hassan Hage’s dry cleaning business and dry cleaner Wafa Hage said people from surrounding businesses rushed to the scene where they tried frantically to revive the boy as his aunt cried hysterically. 'I opened the door and saw the little boy on the ground. I hugged (the boy's aunt) and gave her some water but she was screaming,' Mrs Hage said. Mrs Hage's husband, Hassan, was among those who ran to help, but said Ryan was not breathing and was bleeding from the nose, mouth and ears. Mr Hassan said Concept Funerals employees also ran from their building and tried to revive the young boy. Despite the tragedy, Mr Hage said a similar accident would certainly happen again if road safety in the area was not improved. 'I'm worried it will happen again unless they do something. They need a crossing, anything.' Traffic and Highway Patrol Command’s Acting Assistant Commissioner Stuart Smith said the tragedy was heartbreaking. 'The impact of a crash on everyone who is linked to it resonates well after headlines have faded,' he said. 'After a series of similar events earlier in the year, I would hope anyone with children in their lives would use this an opportunity to talk about road safety with them.' Acting Assistant Commissioner Smith urged parents and caretakers to take extra precautions when near vehicles. 'As a parent, I would plead with everyone that if they are with young children near a roadway always keep holding their hand,' he said. 'To drivers, particularly if you are passing residential areas, do be mindful children may be about.' Oatley Primary School headmaster described Ryan as a well-loved student who will be missed in a letter sent to parents notifying of the death, reported The Daily Telegraph. 'Ryan was a bright, outgoing and delightful student of our school. He loved to know that he was pleasing other students and teachers,' the letter states. 'We will remember his passion for singing and his love for martial arts.' The letter continues by stating that the primary school is supporting Ryan's family and respecting their wishes. Support for parents and children was also offered by the school.","Ryan Leo was hit and killed by a car in Hurstville in Sydney's south .

"By . Ryan Lipman . 'Flush it now' was the warning issued by a Jetstar cabin crew member to a plane full of Splendour in the Grass passengers. The casual employee gave the music festival revellers the heads-up that sniffer dogs were waiting at Sydney airport late Sunday night and suggested they flush their drugs before arrival. 'We have been told there are sniffer dogs and quarantine officers waiting in the domestic terminal, the male crew member said, reported News.com.au. Jetstar confirmed an employee made their own quarantine announcement about sniffer dogs waiting at Sydney Airport late Sunday night . 'If you need to dispose of anything you shouldn't have we suggest you flush it now.' Many of the passengers on flight from the Gold Coast had been at Splendour in the Grass in Byron Bay. There are reports passengers dashed for the plane's toilets and were seen queuing as they clenched things in their hands. Yet the crew member's announcement left some passengers angered and questioning the reasoning behind warning people who may have been breaking the law and otherwise could have been caught. The plane was arriving from the Gold Coast to Sydney and was full of passengers who had been at the Splendour in the Grass music festival, pictured, in Byron Bay . The airline confirmed the employee made his own improvised quarantine announcement rather than the using prerecorded one used by Jetstar. A spokesman said the airline is required to play the prerecorded announcement to passengers on all interstate and territory boarders and that its procedures allow cabin crew to deliver the quarantine message through public announcement as was done on this occasion. 'The crew member's words were poorly chosen and are plainly at odds with the professional standards we'd expect from our team. We're addressing the matter with the cabin crew member involved.' Jetstar has been contacted for comment. Some passengers were angered that the announcement gave people an opportunity to avoid being caught at Sydney Airport, pictured .","A Jetstar crew member warned passengers about sniffer dogs .

"By . Ryan Lipman . Belgian backpacker and self-dubbed world explorer Johan Lolos captured the spectacular moments Northern Territory turtles emerged from the ocean to lay their eggs on Bare Sand Island beach. The island is located south west of the Darwin coast and the photos, taken last week, capture the flatback mother turtles on the sand during a super full moon. Once on the beach, the turtles found a spot to dig their nest before laying their eggs during dusk.  Upon laying their eggs, the mothers to be cover the eggs and then head back into the sea. As well as the stunning beach scapes, Johan, 26, was also lucky enough to photograph some new born baby turtles minutes after hatching. Smaller than a adult human hand, Johan captured a researcher holding one of the babies, moments before it was put down so it could find its way to the water for the first time. With the images featured on the Australia.com Facebook page, they had attracted nearly 86,000 likes as of Tuesday afternoon. Backpacking around the world for almost a year, Johan said observing the turtles laying their eggs was a moving experience. 'Definitely one of the most intense experiences since I've been in Australia,' he said and compared it to swimming with a whale-shark in Western Australian and sea lions in South Australia. 'It was not really about interaction since we are not allowed to approach the turtles too closely, but it was all about observing life. Nature at its finest,' he said. 'I was so impressed by the exhausting work these turtles have to do to lay her eggs, and that was probably the most moving part of the trip. I had great admiration and respect for these animals.'

"By . Ryan Lipman . Samantha Alexander is legally blind due to a genetic disease affecting her vision . Samantha Alexander was celebrating on Thursday after graduating from university - an amazing achievement considering she started losing her sight half way through her studies. The 24-year-old suffers from a genetic disease, cone-rod dystrophy, meaning she has lost about 70 per cent of her sight. With her vision deteriorating since 2010, Ms Alexander had her driver's licence revoked in 2011. 'It's a big ordeal,' she told Daily Mail Australia. She started a Bachelor of Criminology and Criminal Justices via correspondence at Griffith University, on the Gold Coast in Queensland, towards the end of 2010. On Thursday, she graduated with a grade point of average of 6.5 out of seven. Ms Alexander said she faced many barriers in learning without her sight. 'I never thought I was not going to graduate... if I start something I finish it, that's my rule,' she said. Ms Alexander had to use audio software to get information from her textbooks and worked closely with the university's disability unit. 'I had to learn a new style of learning,' she said. She added that taking time off work to study the new learning techniques was not an option for her because she was so dedicated to a cadetship with Corrective Services NSW that she was completing. 'There was no going to a braille school,' she said. Refusing to let her vision condition beat her, Ms Alexander, pictured with her grandmother Chris Clarke, remained determined to finish her studies . The 24-year-old wore an Aboriginal sash to her Bachelor of Criminology and Criminal Justices graduation ceremony at Griffith University in Queensland on Thursday. Pictured right is an image from her Year 12 high school graduation in 2008 . To adapt, she listened to the audio software and memorised what was said so she could type it in her own words using a computer. Still capable of typing, she had special consideration to submit her examinations and complete her coursework by computer. Already looking to the future, she started her Masters of Forensic Mental Health on Monday. Ms Alexander credits landing her 'dream job' and Australian rapper 360's music for getting her through the last few years. 'He (360) has a vision impairment very similar to mine and his songs reflect his experience,' she said. '360 was my saviour'. Her only regret is not using a Starlight wish to organise a meeting with the rapper. In order to complete her undergraduate university studies, Ms Alexander, pictured in February when she finished her course work, had to learn a new learning style including using audio text books . Ms Alexander credits Australian rapper 360's music about his experience with a similar vision condition for getting her through the last few years . Ms Alexander said she became aware her vision was deteriorating in 2011. 'I knew within myself that my vision was going and I had stopped driving about a month before loosing my licence. 'The reason I knew something was wrong was I kept bumping into furniture around the house - I kept walking into things. 'I've go two degrees of peripheral vision left - it's like holding a toilet roll over the eye to create tunnel vision.' With the remaining tunnel about the size of a 5 cent coin, she said black dots further impaired her limited sight. 'If I look at a face I scan it in sections to build pictures in my head,' she said of the fatiguing process. In 2006, Ms Alexander enjoyed her Year 10 formal unaffected by the condition which caused her to loose most of her eye sight in 2011 . 'How I used to make a sandwich - everything is a struggle now,' she said. 'If I'm busy I function better, it stops the depression kicking in,' she said. 'What other choice do I have?'. Starting a cadetship with Corrective Services NSW in 2012, Samantha lived at Emu Plains in Sydney's far west at the time and needed to catch a train to Central station. 'My biggest asset when travelling on the train and to cope with everything was listening to 360's music,' she said. 'I thought I can do this too and it's all good.' 'I was scared - it (Central station) is a busy place and if it's raining I've got two bags, an umbrella and a white cane.' She also credits the recently completed  cadetship for Indigenous Australians for giving her direction. 'It was my dream job... the idea of helping Aboriginal inmates,' she said. Despite the challenges she faced just getting to work, Ms Alexander said the prospect of helping others took precedent over using her cane on the train to work. 'I made contact with Guide Dogs NSW and told them I needed to start learning the travel route,' she said. Ms Alexander's carer and best friend Nicholas Hawkins was by her side at the graduation ceremony . 'Their advice to me was don't do it. It's a long journey and they said I need to start using it (the cane) in the backyard to get to the clothes line.' Ms Alexander said she was advised it could take about eight years before she was capable to use public transport with a cane. Despite disliking using a cane, she was determined not to let this stop her and said it was necessary when trying to 'combat' Central station, where it takes up to 10 minutes to navigate through the people. 'How am I going to change the world if I'm sitting on my backside watching telly,' she said. 'I'd rather be doing something more productive. 'I still do everything as normal as I can... My satisfaction in life is from helping people - I'm the go to person for family and friends.' Despite significant vision loss Ms Alexander has moved to Gregory Hills in Sydney's south west into a home she built with the support of her carer and best friend, Nicholas Hawkins, who lives with her full time. 'He does things around the house. Meal preparation, technical stuff like cooking, He can also do my makeup and eyeliner. I was pretty lucky.' Mr Hawkins also travelled with Samantha to her graduation ceremony. A correspondence student, Ms Alexander travelled from Sydney to the Gold Coast for the graduation ceremony . But one of her biggest struggles has been the reaction of the public. 'When you get a cane, apparently you're famous,' she said. 'It took me 20 minutes to walk from the train through Central station to work and in that time I'd be approached by five people.' 'It made me cranky - I said to a lady in frustration, politely but crankily, about a lady in front wearing high heels: ""The chick in front does not have a cane and you're not going up to her so please leave me alone unless I'm crying or severely disorientated.' However at a later time the same woman did stop to help her when she became lost. 'I recognised her by her voice,' she said. 'People telling me they're proud to see me going to work - that commentary is not necessary. I just want to be treated as normal. 'I'm trying to get by and do what I do and don't want to be harassed or made to feel difficult. 'People came up to me and said ""You poor thing"". People came up and patted me when I was getting onto the train.' While Ms Alexander is still undecided about exactly what she wants to do when she finishes her masters she wants to help the Aboriginal community, possibly in a crime and mental health welfare role. 'I want to help close the gap between white and Indigenous Australians,' she said.","In 2011, doctors declared Samantha Alexander legally blind .

"By . Ryan Lipman . The Australian Commonwealth Games women's swim team uniform is a shock for all the wrong reasons - part of the country has been left off. After the team's formal uniform was slammed as being 'ugly' when it was first revealed last month, the latest problem is the state of Tasmania has been completely left off maps of Australia that are pasted on the women's swim team's one-piece swimsuit. The missing state has caused outrage in Tasmania, with many in the state still sensitive about a similar blunder 32 years ago, which saw the island state dropped from a map of Australia created by performers at the Brisbane Commonwealth Games in 1982. Uproar: Tasmanians have been left outraged that a map of Australia heavily featured on female swimmers' uniforms does not include the island state. Pictured is swimmer Leiston Pickett, left, getting help with her uniform from teammate Kotuku Ngawati during a training session . Australian swimmers Kotuku Ngawati (left), and Bronte Campbell (right), show off their swimming uniform during a training session on Tuesday . The Speedo design has even sparked the ire of outspoken Palmer United Party senator Jacqui Lambie, reported News.com.au. 'I hope that it was an oversight and not deliberate. Tasmania also disappeared from Olympic medals and posters for Baz Luhrmann’s movie Australia, so it's very disappointing that the same oversight has happened a number of times, she said. The senator has even suggested the state be compensated with $5 million for a tourism advertising campaign and money to lower the cost of sea travel to Tasmania. With funding cuts to Tasmanian tourism since 2008, Ms Lambie said an apology with a payment from the government would not be enough to rectify the error, especially for the impacted tourism sector. Tasmanians have hit out at the uniform, after the state was dropped from a map of Australia formed by performers at the Brisbane Commonwealth Games in a similar incident 32 years ago. Pictured is swimmer  Cate Campbell helping sister Bronte adjust her swimsuit . While the women's uniform is plastered with the partial map of Australia, the male swimmers' trunks are not covered in the controversial pattern. Pictured is Emily Seebohm, left, and James Magnussen, far right, with Cameron McEvoy . 'Ordinary Tasmanians will be offended and feelings will be hurt. We're very proud of our state, however more than just feelings will be hurt,' she said. During the games, seven Tasmanian athletes are representing their state. In another shocker, Tie Me Kanagroo Down was not what Australian athletes expected to hear while heading to the flag bearer's ceremony in Glasgow. There are reports a Scottish bus driver played the song by paedophile musician Rolf Harris' as he drove the Aussie athletes on Monday, reported News.com.au. The track was stopped shortly after it started and was featured on an Aussie hits CD bought by the driver and was the third song after Land Down Under and I'd Love to Have a Beer With Duncan. Cyclist Anna Meares was unveiled as Australia's flag bearer during the ceremony. Anna Meares was announced as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony, during the Australian Commonwealth Games official team reception on Monday . Another blunder for the Commonwealth Games was that two unidentified Australian athletes set to compete at the games could have missed their chance at taking gold after a blunder saw them entered in the wrong event. The unaware pair have not been told of the error because it 'has nothing to do with the athletes' said Australian Commonwealth Games Association Chief (ACGA) executive Perry Crosswhite, who is refusing to confirm the athletes' identity or sport. 'One athlete was entered in the wrong event and the other was not entered for an additional event they should have been in,' he said. He also said it was possible the athletes involved do not know the were caught up in the oversight. The mix up saw 48 athletes from eight countries granted special dispensation by the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) so they can take part in their events, reported News.com.au. Entry deadline was June 11 and a CFG statement stated the athletes' administrators were behind the bungle which meant the athletes were not entered could have resulted in them not competing in their events. 'It was never an issue. They were always going to be in. We just had to go through a process that didn’t come out until yesterday,' Crosswhite said. 'Absolutely there was a mistake. The ACGA made an entering mistake and we admitted it straight away and we made sure it was corrected.'","Tasmania has been left off the Australian Commonwealth Games women's swim team uniform .

"By . Ryan Lipman . They are the most hated fees paid by everyone, but that's not going to stop automatic teller machine charges from doubling to $5, a new study has found. Nearly 27,000 ATMs throughout Australia were part of a confidential study by Payments Consulting Network, which found some machines were slugging customers excessive fees, including $3.50 just to check their balance. Machines charging these fees are run independently but their location was not disclosed in the study or by the authors, but are often found in service stations, convenience stores, pubs and clubs, reported The Daily Telegraph. According to research, ATM fees in Australia have not fallen despite Reserve Bank reforms in 2009 . A different data source revealed some machines could have fees as high as $10 and that a large portion of machines were charging a minimum of $4. The largest network of independent ATMs in Australia increased its standard fee from $2.50 to $2.80 last year, with rival operators expected to do the same within months. Yet the increase and the extent of ATM fees come despite attempts by the Reserve Bank of Australia in 2009 to reduce ATM services costs by making them more obvious through the introduction of a 'direct charge' model. A national Galaxy Research poll of more than 1,000 people was released last week and found foreign ATM charges are the most hated fee by financial institutions. The Reserve Bank reforms made it law for customers to be notified that they were facing a charge for using the machine, and their confirmation was required before they could proceed. Despite the new laws, eight out of Australia's 14 ATM operators have gone on to increase their ATM charges. Australian banks are still taking $555 million each year from people who withdraw money from outside their bank’s ATM network, according to research by comparison website Mozo. Australian banks are taking $555 million each year from people who withdraw money from outside their bank¿s ATM network . No ATM operators have cut their fees and most on the Reserve Bank's watch list are today getting an extra 67 per cent,  reported The Daily Telegraph. However NAB, Commonwealth Bank, ANZ and Westpac withdrawal fees remain steady at $2. Other bank-branded and Cashcard and CashConnect ATMs, often found in convenience stores, service stations, pubs and clubs, have withdrawal fees as high as $2.50 per transaction according to Mozo. In 2012, a Reserve Bank report stated there was evidence showing reforms resulted in a fall in the number of transactions at foreign ATMs - machines different from the user's financial institution, reported The Age. Despite the ATM reform, eight out of Australia's 14 ATM operators have gone on to increase their ATM charges . Yet Mozo director Kirsty Lamont said the Reserve Bank's reforms were a failure and more needed to be done to make ATM fees fair. She said there was a risk Australia's big four banks could follow the lead of independent ATM operators by increasing fees, resulting $2.50 becoming the standard ATM withdrawal fee, with about half of the country's ATMs owned by these banks. Consumer group Choice head of campaigns Matt Levey said ATM fees were often excessive. 'ATM fees are way out of proportion to the cost of providing the service, especially charging consumers for simply checking their bank balance,' Mr Levey said. The Consumer Action Law Centre, the Australia Institute and Choice are calling for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission or the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to investigate ATM fees.","The 'hated' ATM fees in Australia have not fallen despite Reserve Bank reforms .

Tomic first signed with IMG as a 12-year-old, spawning marketing deals potentially worth millions of dollars with the likes of Nike, Yonex, Optus and Qantas. While the one-time Wimbledon quarter-finalist has fallen outside the top 100, it's understood Tomic's off-court behaviour was behind the split, according to the US-based Sports Business Journal and tennisworldusa.org. IMG's Australian-based director of tennis, Brian Cooney, has not responded to AAP's calls for comment. Tomic has been involved in a series of off court dramas, including clocking up a string of driving offences in his yellow Ferrari F430 Spider, worth more than $400,000, and losing his license in January 2013 for speeding. He was doing 78kmph in a 60 kilometre zone and received a standard $220 fine and three demerit points, but due to his poor driving record had his license suspended, reported Fox Sports. On Australia Day in 2012, he was pulled over three times while driving a high powered bright orange BMW worth $150,000, and received two $300 fines for the same offence, reported The Daily Telegraph. The embattled tennis star lost his license last year after a string of high-profile driving offences . It was reported he was first pulled over after allegedly revving at pedestrians and he was then pulled over a second time in the afternoon. The third time police tried to pull him over that day, Tomic had refused to stop but was followed home, resulting in a standoff when the tennis player refusing to speak to police until his lawyer arrived. The tennis player had an exemption to drive the sports car on the condition it was for activities related to tennis, including going to and from training. In December 2012, he was given a 12-month one-point good-behaviour licence due to a series of hooning and driving offences across the Gold Coast. Tomic's Ferrarri Spider is worth more than half a million dollars and bears the number plate 'SinCity', the name of a Gold Coast nightclub run by a friend of Tomic's family . The controversial player was photographed receiving a lap dance from young female dancers at the Sin City nightclub on the Gold Coast in November last year. The nightclub is owned by Jamie Pickering, a family friend of the tennis player and is a favourite hang-out for Tomic, who held his 21st birthday party there last year. Tomic has copped criticism for partying instead of training, as his antics have coincided with a drop in form for the player. Among his critics are former tennis great Pat Rafter and Tomic's former coach Neil Guiney. Rafter banned Tomic from a Davis Cup tie in Taiwan last year because of attitude problems, reported The Daily Telegraph. During a press conference following his first-round French Open defeat in May, Tomic lashed out at a reporter who questioned whether his father was suitable to return as his coach after a 12 month suspension for assaulting Tomic's practice partner, Thomas Drouet. The tennis player received a lap dance from two female fans last year at Sin City, a nightclub on the Gold Coast in November last year . Tomic has been criticised for partying instead of practicing as his antics have coincided with a drop in form for the player . The revelation follows Tomic's round-one victory at the Claro Open Colombia in Bogota on Tuesday (AEST). The Australian wildcard beat Uzbekistsan's Farrukh Dustov 6-3 6-3 for his first win on hard courts since January, when he reached the final of the Sydney International. Tomic, who was sidelined for two months after the Australian Open to have double hip surgery, fired 10 aces against the 140th-ranked Dustov and converted three of his four break-point chances. He next faces either 2013 finalist Alejandro Falla or Japan's Tatsuma Ito.

"By . Ryan Lipman . Plain cigarette packaging has been credited for recent falling smoking rates . Plain cigarette packaging is being hailed as a 'vaccine' in the fight against cancer with Australia setting an example around the world. The introduction of the plain packets is being credited as the reason behind a recent sharp drop in smoking rates. Simon Chapman, a professor in public health at the University of Sydney said: 'It's almost like finding a vaccine that works very well against lung cancer,' reported the Sydney Morning Herald. According to the National Drugs Strategy Household Survery, the biggest and longest-running Australian survey on drug statistics, daily smoking rates have tumbled from 15.1 per cent to 12.8 per cent from 2010 to 2013. The statistics also reveal the age people smoke a cigarette for the first time has risen from 14 in 2010, to 16 presently and that 95 per cent of 12 to 17 year olds have tried a cigarette. Despite recent claims made by tobacco companies that plain-packaging was responsible for driving cigarette sales due to a price war, health experts have been quick to label the survey's findings as proof plain-packaging works in the battle against smoking. Professor Chapman said Australia was leading the way, with other countries around the world set to follow our example by introducing the plain-packaging in the future. Health experts have labeled plain-packaging a lung cancer vaccine after a national survey found daily smoking rates fell from 15.1 to 12.8 per cent between 2010 and 2013 . 'It's that big. This will give enormous momentum to the international push for plain-packaging right around the world,' he said. New Zealand, Britain and Ireland have plain-packaging legislation before parliament while France and India are considering following suit. Prior to the introduction of a 12.5 per cent tobacco tax, close to 24,000 people participated in the survey from July to December last year. Professor Chapman said it was critical the survey was completed before the tax was implemented due to the 'influence' this has on smoking rates. 'The only thing that happened in the 12 months before that was the introduction of plain-packaging laws,' he said. As part of a broader trend, smoking rates have fallen by 50 per cent since 1991. Other countries including New Zealand, Britain and Ireland are following Australia's lead, with plain-packaging legislation before parliament . Australian Council on Smoking and Health president Mike Daube said the results were the best he had seen in 40-year  health policy career. Mr Daube said it was likely that target of 10 per cent adult smoking rates by 2018, set by the National Preventative Health Taskforce in 2009, could be beaten. He added the once rates are below 10 per cent, as smoking becomes an increasingly unacceptable behaviour, there would be an even more rapid decline. Crediting plain-packaging as a major influence on smoking rates in the last two to three years, Mr Daube said tax increases, media campaigns and a bipartisan view on tackling the issue have also played a combined role. Geoff Neideck of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, which completes the survey every two to three years, said the findings were part of a broader trend where smoking rates have fallen by 50 per cent since 1991. But Mr Neideck said plain-packaging laws should be seen in the context of changing attitudes and cultural practices. Since 2000, the cost of an average packet of cigarettes has steadily increased.","Plain cigarette packaging credited for recent drop in smoking rates .

"By . Aap . and Ryan Lipman . Loved life: Alana Goldsmith was fun-loving, intelligent and successful, but she took her life at a train station in 2011 after fighting a long battle with anorexia nervosa . She was a bubbly beautiful young girl who fell prey to an eating disorder and the family of a young woman who killed herself after a long battle with anorexia says the illness 'starved her brain and destroyed her hopes'. Alana Goldsmith, of Cammeray on Sydney's north shore, was 23 when she left the hospital where she was receiving care on the afternoon of July 22, 2011 and took her own life at Summer Hill in Sydney's inner-west. The Goldsmith family requested an inquest following her death, to review patient care and explore the issues impacting eating disorder sufferers, carers and practitioners. On Tuesday, Magistrate Mark Douglass told Glebe Coroner's Court that it had been a 'complex and harrowing matter with many difficulties'. He made the finding that Alana had taken her own life while suffering from anorexia nervosa but will not publish his reasons until later this month. Speaking outside the court, Simone Goldsmith said her older sister started wrestling with the illness when she was 15 but managed to hide it from her friends and family for many years. From left, Judy and Simone Goldsmith, the mother and sister of Alana Goldsmith, leave the State Coroner's Court at the end of the inquest into her death in Sydney on Tuesday . The Goldsmith family requested the inquest following Alana's death, to review patient care and explore the issues impacting eating disorder sufferers, carers and practitioners . Judy has previously said it's important for families to look for the warning signs of anorexia and to be educated about the disorder . 'Alana was a fun-loving, vivacious and intelligent young woman until anorexia nervosa starved her brain and destroyed her hopes and dreams,' she told reporters. 'This silent killer is a highly complex mental illness ... We hope that the findings handed down today bring about meaningful discussions ... that result in more resources and better care.' Butterfly Foundation CEO Christine Morgan said people with eating disorders need specialised treatment and early intervention. 'This is an illness that kills,' she said. 'It has the highest fatality rate of any mental illness and we cannot ignore that. We need to have effective treatment. 'We need significantly more resources ... we need more care that is in the community and psychologist and psychiatrists.' Alana had a bright future ahead, pictured right, at an Austrade awards ceremony with former Olympic swimmer Grant Hackett . Judy Goldsmith, pictured at hospital with daughter Alana and baby Simone said Alana's delight at the arrival of her younger sister was typical of her 'joy' of life . On the In Loving Memory of Alana Goldsmith Facebook tribute page Judy Goldsmith posted about the inquest. 'We were fortunate to have a very involved coroner who engaged with witnesses about the myriad issues impacting eating disorder sufferers, carers and practitioners,' she posted last Thursday ahead of the findings and recommendations. 'We feel positive that this gruelling process will bring about change. Yesterday (last Wednesday) I was given the chance to address the court and go on record on behalf of the family. 'We wanted those present to hear about our fun-loving, clever, vivacious, multifaceted Alana. She is always in our hearts. And to those who continue to struggle, please hold onto hope.' Life of the party: Alana Goldsmith's 17th birthday at Pymble on Sydney's North Shore was a typically happy affair, but later she fell into the abyss of an eating disorder which slowly chipped away at her . Alana's sister Simone Goldsmith said her older sister started wrestling with the illness when she was 15 but managed to hide it from her friends and family for many years . Alana Goldsmith was a happy little girl with a bright outlook on life who later became anorexic while studying at university in Japan . Alana Goldsmith with her close friends Natalie and Caz at the beach . Dux of her school, Alana had a bright future ahead of her and had recieved overseas work offers for Mattel and Google, reported News.com.au. About two months after Alana's death, Simone said her family wanted the challenge the perception that anorexia was about being thin. In the wake of their loss, she said the family's aim was to raise awareness of the mental illness, which is 32 times more likely to lead sufferers to commit suicide than their peers. As Alana battled the disorder, her weight fell to 41 kilograms at its lowest and with a height of 170 centimetres, this gave her an alarming body mass index of 14. At 15, Alana showed signs of the disorder for the first time, when she returned home from a Year 9 exchange trip to Japan. Despite her family's shock at her skeletal transformation, Alana blamed her weight loss on her host family not having much food. Alana's mother Judy said her priority was getting her daughter's weight back up but that the problem was much 'deeper' than this. In November 2010, Alana returned to Australia from another trip in Japan and was admitted to hospital. Alana, pictured left with her younger sister, Simone, who she adored and who now with their mother Judy fights to have the plight of anorexia sufferers recognised. Pictured right, the photo of the 23-year-old was taken on Christmas Eve, 2010, which Alana's mother says 'it was to be our last Christmas with Alana. She had been in Northside Clinic for seven weeks and was trying so hard. Alana had well-deserved leave and we enjoyed a beautiful evening on the deck at Cammeray' Her smile, her beauty and her kindness: Alana Goldsmith's family started a Facebook page in loving memory of their daughter to help anorexia and eating disorder suffers and others in need . Prior to her death, Alana used her journal while in hospital to document her mental struggles with the disorder. 'I feel really mentally exhausted. Telling myself that it is OK to be here and eating. But then ED (eating disorder) voices tell me I should leave and lose the weight that I have so quickly gained,' Alana wrote. On the day of her death, Alana left the hospital twice and was not seen by staff. She was found dead hours after leaving for the final time. Alana's mother Judy did not blame the hospital and said families needed to look for signs of the disorder and to be educated about the disorder. 'It was not the care in hospital, per se -- it was just the lack of monitoring,' Mrs Goldsmith said. 'It's voluntary admission but in the era of occupational health and safety, most institutions know how many people are in the building at any point in time. Why isn't that the case for a clinic dealing with mentally ill people?'

"By . Ryan Lipman . Canadian rapper Drake has returned serve after Australian tennis prodigy Nick Kyrgios claimed the performer's music was to blame for his near loss to Czech Republic's Jirí Veselý in the third-round at Wimbledon last month.

"By . Martin Robinson . A glass eye stolen from a corpse by Jimmy Savile, which he then made into a trophy necklace, was sold at a charity auction for £75 shortly after his death. It is believed to have been worn by the paedophile DJ as he co-presented the final episode of Top of the Pops at BBC Television Centre in 2006, where he also groped a child. An official NHS report revealed yesterday Savile had bragged about stealing glass eyes from the sockets of the dead at Leeds General Infirmary, and had them made into rings and medallions. Scroll down for video . Auction: This necklace belonging to Jimmy Savile with a glass eye at its centre was sold for £75 at a charity auction shortly after his death . TV outing: The auction said that the necklace was worn on Top of the Pops and believed to have been when he co-presented its final episode in 2006, where he also groped a child . He also said that he enjoyed interfering with the bodies and one witness told investigators that he had been seen having sex with a corpse. Before he died he asked that his possessions be sold to raise money for his charity, and the necklace with a glass eye at the centre sold for £75 on July 30 2012, according to the Popbitch website. On the same day his 2002 Rolls-Royce which has the number plate JS 247 went for £130,000, and helped towards the £320,000 total raised by his foundation. Among the other 548 lots was Sir Jimmy's famous Jim'll Fix It red chair, a £12,000 gold and diamond encrusted Rolex watch, cigars - and the odd lame tracksuit. The scale of Savile's crimes was never exposed until later that year, so dozens attended the Leeds auction happy to buy his possessions. The chilling glass eye necklace's past only became clear yesterday when the mass of NHS reports into his crimes published yesterday revealed how Savile . boasted about having sex with corpses and had jewellery made from glass . eyes he removed from their bodies.

Investigators discovered the late DJ and Top of the Pops presenter claimed at least 103 victims aged between five and 75. Starstruck NHS workers allowed Savile free reign to sexually abuse patients and hospital staff 'didn't want to hear or believe' what his young victims were saying, the report said. They detailed his 50 year reign of terror at 28 institutions including Leeds, Broadmoor and Stoke Mandeville hospital. One witness told investigators that Savile revealed the origin of his 'gross, big silver rings' when she remarked on them. He said: 'D'you know what they are? They are glass eyes from dead bodies in Leeds Mortuary where I work and I love working there, and I wheel the dead bodies around at night and I love that.' Another, unconnected witness - who was employed at the hospital - added: 'I do remember seeing this ring he had on that looked like an eyeball and - and I must've mentioned it to him.

"By . Martin Robinson . Hacker: Glenn Mulcaire said today that he believed he had the 'blessing of police' when he intercepted voicemails from Milly Dowler's phone . Hacker Glenn Mulcaire believed he had 'the blessing of the police' to legally hack the voicemails of missing schoolgirl Milly Dowler, the Old Bailey heard today. Mulcaire, who was paid £100,000-a-year by the News of the World, says he believed the tabloid was trying to find the 13-year-old using her mobile and PIN number given out by Surrey detectives. Arguing why he should not be jailed when he is sentenced along with Andy Coulson and three others on Friday, Mulcaire thought he was the police's 'lead eye' and did not believe hacking voicemails was illegal. 'He understood the objective was to find Miss Dowler, who by then had been missing for over two weeks', said Gavin Millar QC. 'He was led to believe his work on the case had the blessing of the police and he was fortified in the belief because he was working for a large news orginisation. 'His taskers, he was aware, had close connections with the police, and they had provided him with Milly's mobile number and PIN number he believed had been provided to them by police officers.' Mr Millar added: 'He believed he acted with lawful authority in intercepting the answerphone of Milly Dowler with the full knowledge and authority of the police. 'He believed he had been appointed lead eye, and was proud to be so highly regarded by hiis taskers and the police.' Mulcaire was tasked on the Dowler hack by chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck, and named news editor Greg Miskiw and another executive. 'He was not aware of any suggestion a story would be published in connection with the interception of Milly Dowler's voicemails', he added. 'He thought the information would be given to the police.' The court heard that former editor Andy Coulson and three of his most senior staff 'utterly corrupted' the News of the World at the highest level and presided over phone hacking on an industrial scale. Coulson, 46, had denied plotting to hack phones between 2000 and 2006 but was found guilty following a marathon Old Bailey trial which went on for 139 days. Today, he was joined in the dock by three ex-news editors - Neville Thurlbeck, Greg Miskiw and James Weatherup - and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire who all pleaded guilty to phone hacking before the trial began last year. Scroll down for video . In the dock: Coulson (second right) was in court today with other colleagues guilty of hacking. Greg Miskiw, Dan Evans,  James Weatherup, Neville Thurlbeck, and private detective Glenn Mulcaire (left to right) Facing jail: Andy Coulson was convicted last week and told that he faces up to two years in prison . They now face up to two years in jail for their part in the plot which the prosecution said involved a veritable 'Who's Who of Britain' having their private lives invaded through voicemail interception. Previously, the NotW had insisted phone hacking was the work of one 'rogue reporter', Clive Goodman who was convicted of phone hacking with Mulcaire in 2006. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said: 'Anyone who has ever suggested or believed or been told that phone hacking that was revealed in 2006/7 was the work of a single rogue reporter needs to look carefully at this dock in which there are four employees of the NotW and only one of them can be described as a reporter, Thurlbeck who was chief reporter.' He went on: 'The newsdesk editor job was described as being the hub or engine room of the paper therefore all of these four defendants can be described as highly paid and influential employees of a national newspaper. 'Between them these defendants utterly corrupted this newspaper which became at the highest level a criminal enterprise. 'This was systemic misconduct approved and participated in by the editor himself.' Mr Edis told the court that hundreds of high profile individuals had been targeted by Mulcaire and the NotW journalists but the full extent of hacking may never be known. In the dock: Glenn Mulcaire, Dan Evans,  Neville Thurlbeck and Greg Miskiw (top left to bottom right) will be sentenced along with Coulson on Friday. They were at the Old Bailey today for legal arguments . Over the years, Mulcaire had been paid around half a million pounds by the NotW to hack phones at the request of the newsdesk executives, the court heard. Of Coulson's former colleagues, Miskiw was the most heavily implicated and made some 1,500 taskings to Mulcaire between 1999 and 2006, some even after he had left the newspaper. On July 21 2004, he asked Mulcaire to target Spectator publisher Kimberly Quinn over her involvement with former home secretary David Blunkett. He and Thurlbeck were also responsible for instructing Mulcaire over the Milly Dowler hacking in 2002, the court heard. In all, Thurlbeck's name appeared on 261 pages of Mulcaire's notes, Mr Edis said. Weatherup was the least involved in the plot. His name appeared on just 157 pages of the private detective's notes. Weatherup, Miskiw and Thurlbeck were all involved in targeting another former home secretary Charles Clarke over a false rumour he was having an affair. In April 2006, Mulcaire was overloaded with hacking work, mistakes were made and the NotW plotters started 'turning in on themselves', Mr Edis said. By then, the prosecutor said: 'It is apparent from his notes Mr Coulson himself became a victim of his own conspiracy and others were also hacked.' Mr Edis went on to apply for costs. The total cost of the hacking trial was around £1.7 million but the elements of the case which led to convictions for phone hacking was around £750,000, the court heard. It came as Andy Coulson and former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman were told they face a retrial over claims they agreed to buy two royal phone books from corrupt police officers. Last week the hacking trial jury failed to return verdicts on whether Coulson, 46, and Goodman, 56, conspired to commit misconduct in a public . office. Coulson was back at the Old Bailey today and faces up to two years in jail when he is sentenced for his hacking conspiracy prosecution on Friday. Reaction: Coulson, pictured today, and fellow defendant . Clive Goodman, last week, face a retrial after the hacking jury failed to decide if they had conspired to bribe police for royal phone numbers . Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said today: 'The CPS has taken the position to proceed with the retrial.' Last week David Cameron was humiliated after . speaking out about Coulson's conviction while the jury was still . deliberating on the conspiracy charges he and Goodman face. Justice . Saunders said he was 'very concerned' about the comments the Prime . Minister made after his former spin doctor was found guilty of plotting . to hack phones at the News of the World. The Prime Minister also said that Coulson had lied to him, which was 'capable of affecting Mr Coulson's credibility in their (the jury's) eyes', the judge said. Coulson, of Charing in Kent, already faces jail after the jury found him guilty of plotting to hack phones at the NotW between 2000 and 2006 following the Old Bailey trial which went on for 139 days. Goodman, of Addlestone, Surrey, pleaded guilty to phone hacking in 2006 and despite admitting his activities were more extensive than he had previously said, he will not face any further legal action over it. Lawyers are expected to mitigate for the defendants before Mr Justice Saunders hands down sentences on Friday.

Mrs Thornton was herself recovering from back surgery and saw the TV star kissing and groping a young woman who was so unwell she was unable to resist. 'He just helped himself to her,' she said.

"By . Ryan Lipman . Senior Labor MP Anthony Byrne has warned that Australia faces the prospect of a terrorist attack similar in scale to the Bali bombings, and has pleaded with the government to be more proactive in the face of such a threat. He also raised concerns that Australia's security forces will be restricted in preventing an attack unless Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and other spy agencies are granted new powers. Despite requests for such powers, these have been refused to date, reported The Daily Telegraph. A Bali bombing-type terrorist attack will certainly happen in Australia according to Labor MP Anthony Byrne . The Labor MP and former Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security chair revealed the sentiments of the intelligence community in parliament on Monday. 'That event will be there to cause immense damage to the psyche of the Australian community. That will be its purpose, its intent,' he said. 'I don’t want to be part of a parliament that reacts to an event. I want to be part of a parliament that puts laws in place to prevent that event.' The 2002 Bali bombing happened in the tourist district of Kuta on October 12 and killed 202 people, including 88 Australians and left hundreds injured. Labor MP Anthony Byrne revealed in parliament that an attack of similar magnitude to the Bali bombing was 'inevitable' Members of Islamist group Jemaah Islamiyah were convicted in relation to the bombings. Senior officials from Australia's security services meet tomorrow for a private briefing with Attorney-General George Brandis before legislation to give ASIO new powers is introduced to parliament. On the back of a bipartisan report completed last year of the Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security calls for additional powers for ASIO, it has been reported that Mr Brandis would adopt 41 of 43 recommendations. Yet the government has not included the controversial date retention laws, which would force internet and telecommunication companies to keep metadata for a period of two years. Similar laws were granted to UK spy agencies last week and Mr Byrne said without data retention powers, Australian spy agencies were limited in what he considers a current a high-risk period. Despite warnings about domestic terrorist activity and links to Australians fighting with jihadists in Syria and Iraq, spy chiefs are worried the federal government is not acting quick enough. One of Australia's most high-profile jihadists, Khaled Sharrouf, fled Australia in December on his brother's passport to link up with fundamentalist militia group Islamic State in Syria. Sharrouf is currently being investigated by Australian authorities in relation to allegations he is fighting with Islamic State - a breakaway al-Qaeda group. Scroll down for video . One of Australia's most well-known jihadists, Khaled Sharrouf, fled Australia in December on his brother's passport to link up with fundamentalist militia group Islamic State in Syria . In 2008, he became a convicted terrorist when he pleaded guilty and was jailed for acts in preparation for a terrorist act after he was one of eight people arrested for plotting to attack the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor, in Sydney's south. Sharrouf recently issued a call-to-arms for other Australian Muslims to join Islamic State's bloody war in the Middle East as well as posting a photo on Twitter of a young child brandishing a rifle. In the early hours of July 5, Sharrouf tweeted: 'Come and be part of what we have dreamt...for decades'. It was accompanied by a picture of him decked out in army camouflage posing with a gun in front of a white BMW. This followed his fellow brother-in-arms Mohamed Elomar, one of almost 60 Australians fighting for extremist groups in the Middle East, who took aim at diggers fighting in Iraq, tweeting: 'Look at the end of these Iraqi maliki dogs bunch of girls can't wait to see a Australia soldier cyring [sic] saying bakia.' An earlier picture on Sharrouf's Twitter page of a young child brandishing a gun with the caption: 'One of dawlas youngest members' Another tweet fired off from Sharrouf read: 'My (provisions) are beneath the shade of my sword. We live better than we lived in our country.' But these uploads barely scratch the surface of the disturbing content found on Sharrouf's Twitter page. Earlier posts contain pictures so graphic that Daily Mail Australia has chosen not to describe or publish them. But one that can be shared is of a young child brandishing a gun and smiling with the caption: 'One of dawlas [sic] youngest members' - which was posted late May. Dawlah is Arabic for country or state. Other photos show Sharrouf standing in front of military vehicles as well as fundamentalist propaganda memes. He told people to 'come and be part of what we have dreamt For for decades' and said: 'we live better than we lived in our country ' Khaled Sharrouf (pictured) is part of Islamic extremist group Islamic State - a breakaway group of al-Qaeda . These tweets came just days after the Australian Government said almost 60 Australians fight for Islamic radicals in Iraq and Syria. Meanwhile about 150 Australians were being monitored for supporting terrorist organisations, recruiting fighters or preparing to travel overseas to fight. This information was revealed after Sydney teenager Abdullah Elmir, 17, became the third Australian teenager to walk out on his family in June bound for Iraq to fight in the troubled war zone. He went missing from his family's Bankstown home - in Western Sydney - almost three weeks ago, and has only been heard from once when he contacted his mother to say he was in Turkey. Ten Australians have died while fighting for extremists in Syria and Iraq. The latest is a 22-year-old Sydney man, Zakaria Raad, who appeared in a recruitment video for the terror group Islamic State - formerly known as the 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant' and 'Islamic State of Iraq and Syria' - shortly before he was ambushed in Syria. In one of the recruitment videos entitled There Is No Life Without Jihad, an Australian man who calls himself Abu Yahya ash Shami said he wanted to send 'a message...from a Muslim brother's heart to another brother's heart'. He appeals to Australian Muslims to come join him in the Middle East to restore 'honour' in the region, saying: 'Wake up, wake up and be part of this effort.' The former Sydney resident fled from Australia in December - believed to be going to Syria - on his brother's passport . An ISIS recruitment video titled There Is No Life Without Jihad showed five extremists, including this Australian on the left, urging people to 'respond to Allah' and 'wake up and be part of the effort'","Labor MP Anthony Byrne warns of terrorist attack 'on Australian soil...'

"By . Martin Robinson . Paedophile: Hundreds where abused by Jimmy Savile in hospitals, including one girl so desperate to avoid him she threw herself off a bridge . A child repeatedly abused by Jimmy Savile from the age of nine was so desperate to avoid being visited by the paedophile she cycled off a bridge. The girl fell 15ft and broke her arm but said the DJ still tracked her down and sexually assaulted her again as she recovered in a Leeds hospital. She was so traumatised by Savile's repeated abuse she avoided treatment for a large birthmark on her face in case the star found her, and instead tried to wash it off at home with bleach. The unnamed woman is one of more than 500 victims who were attacked by Savile, considered Britain's worst ever paedophile, who died at 84 in 2011 having never been brought to justice. Today 28 NHS trusts published reports revealing how their patients and staff were habitually abused by Savile. Some ignored complaints and even gave him keys, private rooms and access to basements where he could grope or even rape his victims. In other cases staff also agreed to move people from their beds to his accommodation, where he abused them. At Leeds General Infirmary Savile himself was also made chief porter while working as a DJ, giving him access to all patients. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has today apologised on behalf of the Government and the NHS for letting down the victims and David Cameron’s official spokesman said the report findings are ‘deeply shocking and underline why it’s important that lessons are learnt.’ The girl who cycled off a bridge said Savile targeted her because she was disfigured, and used her to boost his own profile. On one occasion she was picked up in his Rolls Royce and taken for laser surgey at St James' Hospital in Leeds. 'Savile began to kiss my port-wine stain. He nuzzled into my neck and put his hand up my skirt,' she told The Sun. Scene of crimes: Harris habitually abused patients recovering at Leeds General Infirmary, with victims aged between five and 75 . Over three years he continued to abuse her, even after she jumped from the Yorkshire bridge. She said: 'Again he kissed and slavered over me. I knew I couldn't stop him."" She ended treatment telling her parents: ""I'd rather live with my birthmark"".' Today's reports also revealed that Savile also 'interfered' with the dead. Witnesses who helped investigators boasted about having sex with corpses and had jewellery made from glass eyes he removed from their bodies, it was revealed today. The sick paedophile also gloated to others that he enjoyed 'posing' the corpses and that he would 'wheel them around' at night at Leeds General Infirmary. The astonishing and macabre crimes were revealed in a mass of NHS reports into his crimes published today. Investigators discovered the DJ and Top of the Pops presenter claimed at least 103 victims aged between five and 75. They detailed his 50 year reign of terror at 28 institutions including Leeds, Broadmoor and Stoke Mandeville hospital.","Nine-year-old from Leeds one of more than 100 abused in hospitals by Savile .

"By . Deni Kirkova . An obese woman has lost 9st after an addiction to junk food left her £1,500 in debt - and resorting to eating from the bin. Louise Brown, 27, from Surrey, was so addicted to pizza and battered sausages that she ran up eye-watering bills on credit cards to fund her £20-a-day fast food habit. But after eating pizza from a wheelie bin, the 21st 7lbs singer decided to curb her addiction for good and underwent a gastric bypass funded by her parents. Louise Brown, 27, of Surrey, weighing 21st 7lbs and a size 26 (l) and now, weighing 12st 7lbs and a size 12 (r) Now Louise is a slim size 12 and weighs a healthy 12st 7lbs. She said: 'On the surface, I had a happy life. I had a good job, a lovely family and lots of friends. 'But I was leading a double-life. Unknown to my loved ones, my food addiction was spiralling out of control. I was killing myself slowly. 'The joker of the group, I'd always try and laugh about my size, but inside I was devastated. I couldn't bear to look at myself in the mirror. 'Eating pizza out of my bin was the last straw. I realised then that I needed to do something about my addiction to food.' Louise had always struggled with her weight, and by the time she reached 26, she was 21st 7lbs and a size 26. Louise, pictured on holiday before her weight loss, has lost 9st after quitting  an addiction to junk food . Still living at home with her parents, psychotherapist Anna, 50, and pawnbroker Andy, 56, she would return from work to healthy, home-cooked meals and then eat junk food once they were asleep. At her worst, Louise was spending up to £20 a day on chocolate, crisps and battered sausages from her local chip shop. Louise said: 'I'd gorge on sausage rolls, crisps and cream-cheese bagels until I felt sick. I was so ashamed, so I'd eat them in my car or in my room and hide the wrappers. 'But I couldn't hide the bills that were piling up. To my horror, I realised I'd racked up a massive £1.5K of debt on my credit cards - which I'd blown on junk food.' Single for six years after her ex-fiance left her for a woman twice her age, Louise says her lack of confidence had a disastrous effect on her waistline. After gorging on leftover pizza from a wheelie bin, the 21st 7lbs singer decided to curb her addiction . Louise would eat pizza and battered sausages and ran up eye-watering debts on credit cards . Louise said: 'I felt like a fat, worthless mess and I longed to find someone to share my life with. 'But I'd get horrible comments from men on nights out. They'd shout things like ‘God, you're massive' when I walked past. It was so embarrassing. 'I tried to hide how upset I was by joking around. I even dressed up as a clown for Halloween! 'I was absolutely miserable, though, and resigned myself to a life of loneliness and takeaways on the sofa. 'Nothing I tried ever helped me to lose weight. I tried Slim Fast and WeightWatchers, but they never did anything for me. 'I couldn't talk to men, so I watched from the sidelines as all my friends got chatted up - never believing that anyone could ever be interested in me.' The final straw came in 2013, when Louise ate leftover pizza out of her own bin and realised she needed help. Louise, pictured on a night out with friends, underwent a gastric bypass funded by her parents . Louise would return from work to home-cooked meals and then eat junk once her parents were asleep . Breakfast: Five slices of buttered toast . Lunch: Ready-made sandwiches, crisps and fizzy drink . Dinner: Home-cooked meal, followed by takeaway pizza . Snacks: Cream-cheese bagels, battered sausages, sausage rolls, crisps, chocolate . Breakfast: A selection of healthy fruit, yoghurt and cereal . Lunch: Chicken salad . Dinner: Grilled chicken with rice and vegetables . Snacks: A selection of healthy fruit throughout the day . She arranged an appointment with her GP and after discussing the available options, they decided that a gastric bypass was the best step forward. After an anxious eight-month wait, Louise was informed that she wasn't eligible for the operation on the NHS. Louise said: 'I felt as though my whole life had been taken away from me. I had already tried all of the diets, so I knew that without the gastric bypass I would never fulfill my dreams of getting married and starting a family. 'There was no way that I could curb my food addiction by myself.' Louise wears a sexy black outfit before a night out looking incredibly silm . Luckily, Louise's parents were understanding of her struggles and covered the cost of the £11,000 operation. After undergoing the two hour procedure at St Anthony's Hospital in Cheam, Surrey, Louise could only eat yoghurt and soup for three weeks. In a year she lost an incredible nine stone. Louise said: 'It's completely changed my life, and I am so grateful to my parents for paying for my operation. Without it, I would still be hopelessly addicted to junk food. 'I never imagined that I could fit into a size 12. I've thrown away all of my baggy clothes and filled my wardrobe with dresses. I love showing off my figure.' Louise has now found love with 28-year-old Nicky Duke, who works in a brewery. She said: 'Instead of acting like I'm happy, I really am. I have so much more confidence, and I'm willing to take on new opportunities. 'I've said goodbye to my food addiction for good. Now I'm addicted to having fun!'

The 19-year-old woman, who cannot be named, was walking along the bridge with headphones at about 2am on January 16 when she was approached by Amir Mohebbifar. Mohebbifar asked her if she was walking home and then began following her, according to facts tendered to Central Local Court on Tuesday. Asylum seeker Amir Mohebbifar has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a teenager on Sydney's Anzac Bridge's footpath, pictured . The 19-year-old woman was walking along the bridge with headphones at about 2am on January 16 when she was approached . Despite Mohebbifar attempts to strike a conversation, the young woman refused to make eye contact and walked fast to try and 'remove herself from the situation', reported The Daily Telegraph. Despite initially thinking she had got away from the attacker, the teenager heard footsteps approaching as Mohebbifar ran at her. He then put his hand on her shoulder, to which the teenager responded by asking Mohebbifar what he was doing. At this point he pulled the woman back by the shoulder and despite trying to get away, Mohebbifar  pushed the her up against a metal barrier and grabbed her arms. He then tired to kiss the teen, who repeatedly told him to 'stop it' and to go away but the 26-year-old said: 'Why not? What do you mean?'. Using CCTV footage, within an hour police later found Mohebbifar hiding under a car . He then pushed her into a bush off the bridge and despite her screaming, he pinned her against the barrier and squeezed her breasts through her clothing during the sexual assault. The attack became more violent despite pleas from the victim for him to stop and the teenager's attempts to free herself, according to prosecutors and court papers. As the nature of the attack worsened, Mohebbifar suddenly stopped and walked towards Pyrmont. After the attack, the teenager immediately called triple-zero, prompting the attacker to run. Within an hour police found Mohebbifar 'hiding under a car, sweating profusely and breathing heavily' by using CCTV footage. The woman was taken to hospital for treatment and her DNA was found under the attacker's fingernails. The asylum seeker pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated sexual assault. The charges of sexual intercourse without consent and indecent assault were withdrawn. Court papers show Mohebbifar was on Christmas Island from March 2013, and in May he was granted a bridging visa which was set to expire in November 2013. He had been living in Sydney for about nine months after arriving in Australia by boat from Iran. His matter will return to court at a later date.","An asylum seeker pleaded guiltily to sexually assaulting a young woman .

Just 21 per cent found love on a speed date, despite busy speed daters going on an average of seven dates a month - the most of any method. A spokesperson for VoucherCodes.co.uk, who commissioned the research, said: 'It seems Britons have a serious case of first date butterflies, spending nearly £150 on their appearance to make the ultimate first impression. 'With technology giving singletons access to more potential partners than ever before, dating is an exciting experience but could prove an expensive habit.'

"By . Deni Kirkova . A woman who ballooned to 21st was shamed into losing nearly 9st - after she became too fat to go kayaking. Sam Standerwick, 41, from Tredegar, south Wales, enjoyed watersports as a child but drifted into bad habits, sometimes eating whole chickens in one sitting or an entire multi-pack of crisps. But when the project manager decided to take up kayaking again for her 40th birthday she discovered she was too big to easily slip into a wetsuit. Sam Standerwick at her biggest when she weighed 21 stone (left) and more recently at 13st 1lb (right) She embarked on a new active lifestyle and has dropped from 21st 9lbs to 13st 1lbs. 'I bought all the gear to kayak and paddle board but quickly realised I was spending more time preparing for it than actually being out on the water,' she said. 'I was always too tired by the time I got in the water. And of course a part of me always worried I would get stuck in the wetsuit!' Sam, who lives with her husband Gareth and their three cats, said while she had always eaten relatively healthily, her downfall was large portions. 'I didn't go from eating pizza and chips to broccoli and chicken overnight, the difference is beforehand I might have eaten the whole chicken. 'It was the amount I was eating. I grew up in a healthy family so I ate meat, vegetables, pasta and things like that - but just huge portions.' Sam drifted into bad habits like eating whole chickens in one sitting or an entire multi-pack of crisps . After taking up running the weight began to fall off, and Sam, who has no children, is now training for her 27th park race. She used to squeeze into size 28 clothes but has now dropped to size 14 and completed two half-marathons, three 10k races and 26 5k races. But unlike other dieters, the super slimmer said maintaining a healthy appetite and diet was what worked for her. Eating 2,000 calories a day, she runs, cross trains and does weight lifting on a regular basis. Sam hiking during her weight loss. She took up running the weight began to fall off . She has completed two half-marathons, three 10k races and 26 5k races . 'It's not about fad diets or 1,200 calories a day,' she said. 'I'm never hungry, if I was then I couldn't do it. I think a lot of people do it, they crash diet and fail. 'It's easier than people make out. For me I've not found it impossibly difficult because I've not deprived myself of anything.'

She has now banned herself from buying any more - and asked her family to stop buying it for her, too. She said: 'My fascination started when I saw the famous Andy Warhol print of her. 'I was hooked on Marilyn from that day on and I've collected all sorts of items since I was 13-years-old. Paris McKenzie collected everything from bikinis to fridge magnets .

"By . Deni Kirkova . From playing by The Rules to Bridget Jones' obsession with appearing to be an 'aloof, unavailable ice queen', lots of relationship advice for women seems to hark back to playing hard to get. Now one relationship expert has come up with yet another take on this concept: treating your partner like a puppy. Remember the unconditional love and attention you get from a devoted hound? Well, life coach Sloan Sheridan-Williams suggests that we can get the same from our partners - by training them as you would a puppy. Scroll down for video . Sloan says you should reward good behaviour and ignore bad behaviour with your partner, as with your dog . 'What I have found in my relationship coaching is that partners who follow a few simple puppy psychology rules in their relationships tend to have healthy, loving partnerships,' says Sloan. 'These are generally based on the four pillars of relationship success; honesty, trust, respect and integrity.' While Sloan recommends drawing upon traditional puppy psychology, she doesn't suggest women should literally treat their men the same way they do their dogs. 'That would be disrespectful and would not work to produce lasting results,' says Sloan. 'But I do condone changing your behaviour to elicit a better response from your partner. 'In nature, dogs like to form packs and therefore it makes sense to relate to people in the same way you would relate to man's best companion.' She says don't offer your partner everything on a plate or they will never learn how to appreciate you . With a puppy you very soon realise they do not know how to regulate their eating, playtime hours or even their behaviour towards other dogs. Just as you wouldn't put a whole bag of dog food out and allow a puppy to decide how much to eat or not, don't offer your partner everything on a plate. Puppies are taught early on they have to earn respect and rewards by good behaviour. Using the same logic, if you give your other half everything they want without them earning it, they will never learn how to regulate their wants and desires and therefore, they will never learn how to appreciate you. Every dog owner knows that feeling when their puppy is off the lead and running towards a squirrel or worse still a busy road and our instinct is to run towards them. However the experienced dog owner knows that catching their dog's attention then running the other way is far more likely to get your puppy to start chasing you. In relationships the same applies, chasing your partner, checking up on them or making them feel that you are always there is going to inevitably push your partner away or at the very least create complacency in them. Apply puppy psychology by creating scarcity. Moving away from your partner when they pull away, be it in the form of catching up with friends or finding a new hobby, enables them to come running back to you. Sloan is a leading diagnosticians in the complementary therapy world . With puppies we don't give mixed messages, we clearly say no when we mean no and we clearly show them what makes us happy and what does not work for us. Communicating your wants and needs clearly to your other half in the way you do to a puppy helps you draw boundaries as to what you will and won't tolerate. It is unfair to expect your partner to read between the lines so be clear, concise and logical in your requests for the best outcome. When training a puppy most dog owners will tell you punishment doesn't work. The only way is to reward good behaviour and ignore bad behaviour. The ethos here is to forgive and forget but do not tolerate. It is important to be compassionate but don't be a pushover. The first step is to find out what your partner considers a reward and then come up with a plan to deliver it in a timely fashion immediately after the positive act. The final step is to decide which behaviours elicit a reward. Each couple has their own idea of good behaviour be it flowers or completing chores around the house or helping get the children ready for school, whatever it is make sure your other half adds value to the partnership before you reward them. Any reward scheme needs to be compounded over and over for long lasting results otherwise your partner will lose interest in maintaining the positive behaviours. You will see that other dogs will quickly teach puppies what is acceptable game play and what is too much. They show short sharp bursts of growling and then defend their space. You will see an intelligent puppy, back away lick its wounds and approach with more caution the next time. Likewise, let your partner learn the hard way, sometimes he needs to get bitten to learn not to dip his toe in to the fire. Whether your partner has a wandering eye, doesn't do his chores or is lazy with your children although you obviously cannot bite them, you can make their life uncomfortable. As I said before, punishment doesn't work. However, if you give them a short sharp shock, your partner may retreat temporarily to lick their dented ego but they will return with a more desire to step up to the plate. You must refuse to play if they exhibit unsavoury behaviours, and they'll eventually step up to the plate . A puppy will know the weakest link in any pack and will often beg from them. The owners who show firm resolve never to feed their dog at the table will find their dog will not ask for food because they will not waste energy on a fruitless task. Consistency is key to talking to anyone be it a partner, a friend or a work colleague. If you show you are firm in what you believe be it your values, ethics or morals you will quickly find most people will realise they cannot shift your position and they won't bother trying. They will also clearly know that carrying out A,B and C will produce a specific result and then they can choose if they want the same result as you or they can move on. Dogs, puppies especially, are famous for selective attention. They have a filter that blocks out constant talking or yelling of their name until they want to acknowledge it. Likewise, humans have a way of filtering out the voice of a partner who nags, complains, whines or makes them feel negative emotions. It is like the sound of your voice becomes white noise and they no long respond to it. The best way to prevent this is to try to keep upsetting exchanges short and clear, and afterwards immediately turn the conversation back to a more positive or interesting topic. That way your partner will not want to block you out as they will be genuinely interested in what you have to say. They . say your puppy can sense your fear. This can make the puppy agitated, play up or . even turn on you as the weakest member of the pack. Applying the same . psychology to your partner, it is imperative that you do not show fear . of losing them. The best way to reduce fear . of abandonment, loss or rejection is to make sure that your sense of . self comes from within and not from your partner. Focus on boosting your . own self-esteem and confidence rather than becoming clingy and fearful . around your partner. Your partner may retreat temporarily to lick their dented ego but they will return with a vested interest . If at first you don't succeed at creating a change in your partner then try again. The lessons you learn are about making changes in yourself and just like with the gym you need to keep applying positive action to help you progress forward to the relationship you want and desire. If the prize is worth the effort then keep applying the principles over and over again until you see lasting changes. In some instances it really is them not you in which case just like with any disobedient terror of a puppy who cannot be trained by you, rehoming is the best option. You really only have two choices that will result in lasting happiness, which is to be authentic and accepting or to walk away. Although it is terribly hard to let go, it might prove better for both. There is always someone else who will fall in love with that cute face and then your partner can become their problem not yours. 'Training yourself and ultimately changing your partner's response to you should be a fun process, think of it as behaviour modification and lifestyle changes over rigid rules,' says Sloan. 'The brain does not like loss and so if it perceives the change to be too drastic in you then it will be harder to keep to your new way of life. Make little changes every few days until they start to feel natural and authentic to you increasing your repertoire until you have adapted to all the rules that you wish to implement. 'Remember to keep focus on the bigger picture, which is to move towards positive emotions such as forgiveness, love, acceptance after all you chose to be with your partner and if you choose to stay then you need to accept them as a package. Do this by moving away from unhelpful emotions such as fear, lack of trust, and game playing and instead lead by example. 'The power of puppy psychology can be adapted to more than just relationships, when you have mastered the 10 basic steps, have fun applying them to a multitude of situations for long lasting results.'

"By . Deni Kirkova . John Lewis have appointed a new set of 'little' product experts to help design a toys and interiors collection for little ones. The so-called Little Panel consists of six 6 and 7 year olds who will help to shape the department store's Children's Rooms homeware range. Three boys and three girls from East London's Maryland Primary School in Stratford, will name new product items as well as writing product descriptions which can be easily understood by children of the same age. John Lewis' Little Panel, (left to right) Jasmine Rannie, 6, Lorenzo Hindley-Quattrini, 7, Teodora Buljcik, 7, Omar Kamran, 6, Julia Aleksandrowick, 7, and Kai Prasal, 7 . a duvet cover designed by the panelists, will now go into production ahead of going on sale in September of this year. In addition, descriptions written by the panel will appear on product packaging and on the John Lewis website. The children have also named four products, including Mr Sharky the shark bean bag and Tommy the toy monkey. Omar Kamran, aged 6, who named the shark bean bag said: 'I always go shopping with my mum and dad and now I am part of it as my opinions count.' Kai Prasal, aged 7, who has designed a new duvet cover, said: 'It's good giving toys names, because that's how they come alive. Teodora and Kai test out the new Children's Room department . 'I like my rainbow design as it has got lots of bright colours and is nice to look at. It was very exciting and I feel very lucky to do it.' The duvet cover, featuring a rainbow design, will be available online from September 2014. Dr Pat Spungin, Child Psychologist said: 'Children start to assert their independence and individuality from a very young age. 'With toddlers it is often tantrums and saying no, but as children grow older they're more comfortable expressing their personality. 'One of the ways in which they can do this is by choosing how to decorate their own personal space, their bedroom. 'Being able to choose among different furnishing styles, gives a child the feeling of independence and self-confidence that comes from making an important decision.' Aleksandra Zivkovic-Buljcik, Teodora Buljcik's mother, said: 'It's fantastic to see a retailer such as John Lewis involving children in product decisions. 'Over the last few years Teodora has developed her own taste and interests, for example, she particularly likes owls, so is naturally drawn to products that include them. 'I believe it's important as a parent to listen to your child's opinion and let them express their creativity when decorating their own private space. 'Teodora thinks in her own way, and I try to nurture this. I encourage her choices as this is how she expresses her personality and what makes her special.' Teodora, Lorenzo, Kai, Omar, Jasmine and Julia with Luke Arnold, Department Manager for Nurseries at John Lewis . Lorna . Jackson, Head Teacher at Maryland Primary School, said: 'It has been a . fantastic opportunity for the children, who have really enjoyed being . involved. 'We . see children develop their own personal taste at a young age, and we . encourage them to express their personalities as much as possible.' A John Lewis spokesperson said: . 'Children very much like to be involved in the design process of their . rooms, and are naturally very creative. This year we decided to work . with a small group of children to find out exactly what they want for . their bedrooms. With the help from our 'Little Panel', we will aim to . make buying children's homewares easier for parents and more fun for the . kids themselves.' The ongoing partnership will see children being being consulted for their input on new ranges and products. The children will not be paid but all of the Little Panel get to keep all the toys and products that they test - and of course full consent has been granted by all parents involved. The project is been part of their art project, so hasn’t taken anytime out of their school day. The initiative launched this week and will be piloted at the John Lewis Stratford store.

"By . Deni Kirkova . Regency costumed guests arrived in their dozens for dinner and dancing at the Pride and Prejudice Ball at Chatsworth House yesterday. Jane Austen, who stayed there while penning her famous novel of the same name, is believed to have based her depiction of the fictional Pemberley, Fitzwilliam Darcy's residence, on the stately home. Guests turned out in stunning regency attire including full length gowns with classic square necklines and short puff sleeves, made from soft muslin fabrics. Costumed guests pictured left to right - Simon Bourne, Rebecca Markillie, Chrissie Sheerstone, and Bruce Goodwin . Most dresses were fitted tightly under the bust in a period-perfect empire style and paired with long gloves, which ladies always wore when outside the house. Gentlemen, meanwhile, dressed up as dandies in so-called 'Wellington boots' - knee-high footwear at the height of regency fashion - perfectly tied silk cravats, waistcoats and dinner jackets. The ball in Derbyshire staged an evening to remember, celebrating the 201 years since the publication of Pride and Prejudice. Dubbed the Pride and Prejudice Regency Ball, the soiree began at 7.30pm and ended at approximately 11pm, with tickets costing £85 per person. The evening began with champagne and canapés . in the Painted Hall with live entertainment from Lady Georgianna, an . 18th century girl band. Guests were then invited to tour the North Wing of the house before making their . way to the Carriage House restaurant to enjoy a sumptuous, themed . five-course dinner. Lady Georgianna joined guests at dinner with . Regency style poems and songs. Women wore frocks with square necklines, puff sleeves and empire waistlines (l) while some went all out in long gloves - which were always worn outside the house . Young Austen fan Juliette Boland from Los Angeles, America, wore era-appropriate attire . With capacity for 100 or more, the . vast majority of Austen fans turned out in full costume - a key . point of the ball, though the fancy dress wasn't compulsory. Jane Austen visited Chatsworth House in . 1811 while staying at the Rutland Arms in Bakewell while writing Pride and Prejudice. The stately home is believed to be her . inspiration for Pemberley, the residence of the novel's romantic hero . Mr Darcy. Austen wrote in the novel: 'The . eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite . side of the valley into which the road into some abruptness wound. 'It . was a large, handsome, stone building standing well on rising ground, . and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front, a stream of . some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any . artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely . adorned.' In the book, lead character Elizabeth . Bennet meets Mr Darcy for the first time at a similar event to the Pride and Prejudice soiree - but . takes an immediate dislike to him.

"By . Deni Kirkova . A hot new fashion label dressing everyone from Taylor Swift to Lily Aldridge in the U.S. has struck a chord on British shores. UK fashion icons such as Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Alexa Chung and even Cressida Bonas have been spotted wearing styles from the cool new Reformation brand this summer. Their cutting-edge co-ords, floral maxis and spaghetti strap slips have earned them a place in the most A-list of wardrobes. And the best bit: this celebrity label is actually affordable. With prices starting at £40 for a top and going up to about £150 for a dress, the profile of America's newest cult clothing label is about to soar. Rosie out with Jason Statham this month in Beverley Hills wearing a black floral print maxi halter dress by The Reformation, Gianvito Rossi boots and a Givenchy purse . Celebrities like the label because everything is produced in limited amounts, meaning that it's unlikely anyone will show up to an an event wearing the same thing as them. Reformation dressmakers either up-cycle vintage threads or create something new out of leftover fabrics . Cressida, 25, recently chose a pretty £150 cutaway maxi dress for the marriage of Arabella Llewellyn and Thomas Burwel in Hampshire. Designer and owner Yael Aflalo, from . Los Angeles, hailed the style of Prince Harry's former girlfriend during a recent interview with Grazia. 'First of . all I think Cressida looked absolutely lovely, and second I can't tell . you how rewarding these moments are for me. I know it's a challenge to . get dressed for a wedding,' Yael Aflalo said. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley wears Reformation in Malibu, California, earlier this month . 'So . much of what I design is for a modern woman who doesn't want to adjust . her style or buy a dress she will never wear again - especially when it . comes to getting dressed for a wedding. 'Cressida . looked totally appropriate by accessorizing our Charles dress with . heels and a clutch, and she would look equally appropriate throwing on a . pair of sandals and wearing it to lunch with friends.' The brand has been flying under the radar since Yael Aflalo started it as a sustainably conscious side project five years ago. But with two flagship stores in Los Angeles and New York City and a growing list of celebrity clients, Yael can safely say it's now a full-time job.

She has just finished her latest modelling campaign, shot by Karl, for the yet-to-be-seen holiday makeup collection for Japanese brand Shu Uemura, called 'Shupette' (think furry fake lashes).

Karl told Marie Claire: 'Miss Choupette loves Latin but hates opera, but I only listen to music if she is awake. 'Her grooming routine is a lot of work. She has two maids because she doesn’t like to be alone. They do all the brushing - she's beyond spoilt and sleeps on the back of my bed.'

In February MailOnline reported that at least 16 properties - with a combined value of an estimated £350million - on the street are currently standing empty after being abandoned by their super-wealthy owners. A third of homes on the Avenue's most expensive stretch have been unoccupied for up to 25 years, with rooms taken over by plants, according to the investigation. Even those houses which have not been abandoned are unoccupied much of the time, according to residents, as they have been bought by rich foreigners who usually live abroad. The sky-high prices are one clue to why so many of the houses are empty, as the homes are unaffordable for nearly all Londoners, meaning they end up being bought by overseas royals and oligarchs who maintain their main residence elsewhere.

"By . Jaya Narain . Visitors took full advantage of yesterday's warm and sunny weather to marvel at the UK's largest laburnum arch. The huge floral canopy can be found at Bodnant Garden in Conwy, North Wales, with the damp weather meaning it is expected to bloom for far longer than its usual two weeks this year. But those wanting to visit the attraction are encouraged to enjoy it while the good weather lasts, as forecasters are warning that the worst hailstorms to hit the UK for 170 years are likely to arrive this weekend. Magnificent: The 55-metre long floral canopy can be found at Bodnant Garden in Conwy, North Wales. Last year Bodnant Garden was voted the winner of 'The National Trust Gardens Award' by National Trust members and visitors to the tourist attraction . Awe: Families made the most of yesterday's glorious weather to visit the UK's largest laburnum arch at Bodnant Garden in Wales. The damp spring we have just experienced means the flowers are likely to bloom until July - several weeks longer than it would in drier conditions . History: Bodnant Garden was created by successive generations of the McLaren family, but was primarily the creation of the 2nd Lord Aberconway who gave it to the National Trust in 1949. It has been open to members of the public ever since . Just when you thought it was safe to dust . off the barbecue and put on your sun hat, forecasters have stepped . forward to pour cold water on weekend plans. They are predicting thunder and lightning, torrential rain, the chance of flooding and some of the worst hailstorms for 170 years. The were no such concerns for the families who visited Bodnant Garden however, as they made the most of yesterday's glorious weather to visit the UK's largest laburnum arch. The arch is 55 metres long and, as its flowers are currently in full bloom, presents a magnificent yellow canopy under which guests can walk. The colourful display is short-lived however, usually lasting only a few weeks in late May and early June - although experts predict that the damp spring  we have just experienced may cause the flowers to bloom until July this year.

The colourful display is short-lived however, usually lasting only a few weeks in late May and early June - although experts predict that the damp spring  we have just experienced may cause the flowers to bloom until July this year . Taking a stroll: Despite looking incredibly attractive, all parts of the laburnum plant are poisonous, and can be lethal if consumed in excess . Although the blooms may last until June, it is highly unlikely the warm weather will. Forecasters have issued severe weather warnings for most of the UK this Saturday, with heavy rain predicted alongside thunderstorms and ‘intense’ hail. Twister tornado-like cloud formations were even spotted snaking their way across fields over Lincolnshire yesterday. A . Met Office spokesman said they would have been funnel clouds. ‘They are . the first stages of a tornado, created by low pressure, but because . they do not reach the ground they don’t become tornadoes,’ he added. ‘We . do get the occasional tornado in the UK which is where a funnel cloud . touches the ground. We have had sightings of these clouds this week and . last week in the UK.' The calm before the storm: Those wanting to lap up the last rays of sunshine before a weekend of predicted storms took advantage of high temperatures yesterday at Brighton beach, Sussex . Parts of the country, particularly around the south coast, including Sussex as above, basked in glorious sunshine yesterday - the last day of expected sunshine until next week . They may be an indication of the conditions to come with two weather fronts set to collide over the UK tomorrow. Warm high pressure is due to sweep in from Europe today but it will clash with a low pressure ridge heading in from the Atlantic in the south west. The result will be torrential rain as well as hailstones, brisk winds and thunderstorms across large parts of the country for much of Saturday. The Met Office has already issued a yellow severe weather warning for the whole of  England and Wales, which will also cover southern parts of Scotland. A spokesman said: ‘Warm, humid air will be pulled northwards from France and Spain late on Friday and during Saturday. ‘Within this air mass, there is an increasing likelihood of heavy, thundery downpours breaking out. ‘Heavy, thundery rain is expected to affect parts of the UK on Saturday. ‘The . public should be aware of the potential for localised flooding due to . the intensity of these downpours although at this stage the location of . the heaviest rainfall remains uncertain.’ Twister tornado-like cloud formations were even spotted snaking their way across fields over Lincolnshire yesterday . With grey clouds seen over the skies this week, coupled with warm temperatures, the Met Office has issued a yellow severe weather warning for the whole of England and Wales, and parts of southern Scotland, for Saturday . John Griffiths of the forecast company MeteoGroup said: ‘It is going to be very unsettled on Saturday with the chance of torrential rain and severe thunder and hailstorms. 'These are going to sweep up the UK from the South West heading towards the North East and into southern Scotland and will be quite lively in places.’ However, he said, conditions will improve as the storm front passes. Sunday will be a lot brighter with the beginning of next week improving further. Last month the Shard in London – western Europe’s tallest building – was struck by lightning during a thunderstorm. A . study by the Met Office and Newcastle University earlier this week . warned that climate change could result in heavier summer rainfall in . Britain, which in turn could increase the risk of flash flooding. The . worst hailstorm ever recorded in Britain struck in August 9 1843, . causing huge craters and widespread injuries across central and southern . England. The storm caused . so much damage that a brand new insurance company, the General Hail . Insurance Company – later known as Norwich Union – was set up.","Saturday could see some of the worst hailstorms to hit the UK in a number of years, forecasters say .

"By . Deni Kirkova . A morbidly obese mother-of-four shed an incredible 25 stone through dedicated diet and exercise. Jennifer Bodek, 49, from Thurso in the Highlands, beat her crippling food addiction, ditched her mobility scooter, and ran the 5k Race for Life to celebrate. Now a keen runner, Jennifer couldn’t buy clothes from plus-size store Evans because they only went up to a size 34 - and she needed an estimated sized 48. Jennifer Bodek was forced to get around on a mobility scooter has shed 25 stone (l) competing in Race for Life . She hopes to inspire other people so that they too can lose weight without having to resort to surgery . She used to get . through 24 bags of crisps a day, eat two McDonalds meals at a time and . then a third for the journey home. Her waistline was so wide at seven feet that she stitched her own home-made swimming costume because she couldn't find one to fit. Then she was admitted to Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, with double pneumonia and respiratory failure. Three doctors brought her back to life twice after her heart failed, and it took ten nurses to roll her over because she was so heavy. She . spent seven days in intensive care and a total of 21 days on the ward . and had to be revived twice after suffering heart failure. During that time she saw an image of her children standing around her grave, weeping. It was a turning point in her life. Jennifer Bodek was forced to get around on a mobility scooter . After her ordeal she vowed to slim down in 2010 and has since lost a staggering 25 stone in three years and three months. Jennifer, who is currently unemployed, weighed 39 stone and was told . she would die if she did not diet. She now weighs 14 stone and wears a . size 18. She is hoping to get down to 12. Before she lost weight Jeniffer could barely get out of her mobility scooter or turn the steering wheel in her car because her stomach was in . the way. Now she runs miles at a time on a regular basis and . volunteers as a British Divers Marine Medic rescuing seals, dolphins . and whales. 'Going from a mobility scooter to a 5k Race for Life run in Inverness is quite an amazing journey,' she said this week. She completed the run in aid of cancer research in 46 minutes in memory of her mother, father and sister. Jennifer, . who admitted she had a lapse in her diet last year and put on five . stone, managed to get back on track and lost 9st 3lbs in . 33 weeks. She controls her weight by eating sensibly, walking, going . to the gym and running regularly. 'I am going to keep this up. It has got to the . point now where it is a way of living and I feel I am no longer . captured in my own body,' she said. 'I decided I didn’t want to be fat and 50. I was as big as a whale, and now I’m rescuing them.' Jennifer lost the weight through sheer determination. She'd tried diets before, but says she succeeded with meal replacement diet All About Weight, who temporarily put you on shakes, soups and bars instead of usual hearty meals. She now has porridge for breakfast, and a . chocolate milkshake for lunch. For her dinner she’ll choose from . cottage pie, spaghetti bolognese, curried noodles or soup, with a . milkshake for supper. She lost 22lbs in her first week, and 9st 3lbs in her first 33 weeks. Jennifer used to gorge on a typical breakfast of four slices of bread covered . with fatty bacon with four sausages, smothered in tomato ketchup. She would then get through 10 to 15 family-sized chocolate bars, half a gateau with cream . and piles of chips and several McDonald's meals for dinner. She says she was getting through around 5,000 calories a day. Breakfast - 4 slices of bread with bacon, 4 sausages, lots tomato ketchup .

Her brother Terry Ellis, . 19, died in a farming accident when he was gassed by silage in 1980 and she turned to food for comfort in her grief.

She stressed the need to tackle the growing obesity problem and reminded David Cameron that it is expensive to eat healthily. 'A . frozen lasagne costs about £2 but to make one is about £6. Fruit and . vegetables are very expensive but you can buy a 24-pack of crisps for . £1.99,' she stated.

"By . Deni Kirkova . If self-restraint and portion control isn't your thing, a craving-quencher hailed as the ultimate snack substitiue might soon be hitting shelves. One inventor has come up with the Listerine Strip-type product called Cravings, which tastes of delicious milk chocolate but contains no sugar and absolutely no calories. 'Every pack has 24 strips; you pull one strip and let it dissolve in your mouth for a blast of flavour,' says founder Ian Goldfarb of his Kickstarter project. Scroll down for video . Listerine Strip-type product tastes of delicious milk chocolate but contains no sugar and absolutely no calories . 'It's not a new technology, edible film has been around a long time, but we will be repurposing it using flavors we crave. This is where the fun begins.' So when you get ravenous for a Mars bar but don't want to counteract those miles pounding the treadmill, you can simply put the dissolvable, edible film on the . roof of your mouth and savour the flavour instead. Your body will be . tricked into thinking it has had what it asked for, and you can avoid . piling on those pounds. A pack has 24 strips and is set to retail for less than £6, with a bundle of three packs coming in at less than £15. The makers claim it will help dieters satisfy their chocolate cravings without any guilt and could soon be a reality if Goldfarb secures his pledge of almost £24,000. The Willy Wonka-type inventor needs to multiply his current pledge of £2,650 almost tenfold in less than 24 hours. Ian Goldfarb needs to multiply his current pledge of £2,650 almost tenfold in less than 24 hours . He was inspired by his own inability to say no to snacks. 'For years I've been following the standard regiments of working out and watching what I eat, but I've always felt like something was missing. I constantly get cravings that lead to binge eating sessions... and then I counteract a full week of healthy diet and exercise,' he says. 'Easy things like switching to diet sodas and removing breads were a good start. By limiting the types of food I ate, I found a way to control my calorie intake. Still, I did not have a way to suppress my cravings for chocolate, breads, ice cream, etc. 'I discovered a possible solution some years ago in Listerine Strips. It's an edible film flavored for consumers. 'After doing some research, I discovered that adding flavors to this edible film is a relatively simple process, and there are several flavor development companies. I also discovered that it is possible to create zero calorie edible film with the flavors of sweets, meats, breads, salty snacks, or anything we desire.' 'After selecting our medium for craving suppression the next step was to decide the flavour,' he says. 'This was a fun but overall painful process to narrow down the selection of tasty flavors. Research doesn’t lie, and in the end, chocolate was the winner.' For more information see: kickstarter.com/projects/2077077993/cravings-the-zero-calorie-chocolate .

"By . Jaya Narain . A Ukip Euro MP was branded ‘crass, ignorant and insensitive’ yesterday after he joked about encouraging jihadists to blow up a building that spoils his view. Steven Woolfe said that if ISIS terrorists ever came to the picturesque city of Chester he would ask them to destroy a newly-built NHS centre near his home. The 46-year-old, who was elected an MEP for North West England in May, told a local newspaper: ‘If you had Ukip policy on planning it would never have got through. ‘My view of the lovely cathedral, one of the most beautiful buildings in England, is now blocked. As a joke, if ISIS came in I would be saying that’s the first building you can get, please. Just move it so I can have my vision back.’ The extreme Islamist group ISIS has been engaged in a series of horrific massacres across Iraq and Syria since early 2013. Bob Thompson, the Lib Dem’s parliamentary candidate in Chester, said the comment spoke volumes about the character of Ukip. He added: ‘At a time of serious terrorist activity in various parts of the world ... Ukip inviting a terrorist organisation like ISIS to destroy a building in our city is crass, ignorant and insensitive.’ Mr Woolfe, a former barrister who is the party’s Migration and Financial Affairs spokesman, later apologised, saying: ‘The devastating and worrying violence in the Middle East is something I am well aware of and which I have commented on on many occasions. The issues and death are no laughing matter. ‘The joke was to identify an ugly building in Chester which has altered the beautiful historical views and surrounding architectural context.’ The extreme Islamist group ISIS has been engaged in a series of horrific massacres across Iraq and Syria since early 2013 . Mr Woolfe, 46, said: ‘I simply used hyperbole which is a common method in northern comedy. 'I didn’t think for a moment this would be regarded as something I actually wished for or advocated. In future I shall be more circumspect and just stick to professional language.’ However, agreeing with him about the NHS building, Mr Thompson said it was a ‘poor design which does no favours for our city.’ The building is described as a super-surgery which will amalgamate a number of GP surgeries in the area, something which has angered residents.","Steven Woolfe joked that the terror group could prioritise the building .

"By . Jaya Narain . We may pride ourselves on our handiwork around the house – but according to Homebase, modern homeowners are so lacking in DIY skills that it’s having to change the layout of its stores to help them cope. Instead of displaying items in broad categories such as plumbing, electrical or heating, it will group them by specific tasks. So if you need to ‘Fix a leaking tap’ or ‘Put up a shelf’ then every item needed for that job – right down to the nuts, screws and bolts – will be stocked in the same place. The required tools will also be nearby. Transformation: According to Homebase, modern homeowners are so lacking in DIY skills that it's having to change the layout of its stores to help them cope (file picture) Homebase hopes it will bring to an end the frustration of having to know what you need before you even start the job and endless running between departments. The firm says it is making the change because the younger generation is no longer picking up DIY skills from parents. The overhaul was prompted by research showing that 50 years ago every young adult would have been able to wire a plug, fix a leaking tap or put up some shelves – but that is not the case today. ‘A once familiar rite of passage of family life seems to have come to an end,’ said Simon Rix of Homebase. ‘Children are now less likely to possess DIY skills than ever. Change: Instead of displaying items in broad categories such as plumbing, it will group them by specific tasks . ‘Yet as first time buyers look . for ways to save extra cash, the necessity to learn home maintenance . skills has never been greater. ‘Saving money by doing it yourself . has become essential to make homes affordable for first time buyers in . the middle of a housing price boom – but relatively few know how to . cope.’ He added: ‘We’re breaking the mould which assumes that people who shop for DIY items are already accomplished builders. That used to be true – it’s not any more.’ Homebase has launched a major campaign to restore the tradition by showing everyone how easy it can be by holding the hands of those new to DIY. It has become the first retailer to totally re-examine how DIY goods are displayed and sold, making it much easier for people with absolutely no DIY experience to do tasks around the home. The firm has also changed the way products are displayed online, making it easier to gain advice and buy everything they need in one place. And a range of free online videos is being provided to novices, giving step by step instructions on how to complete each DIY job.","Firm will group items by task to help homeowners lacking in DIY skills .

"By . Jaya Narain . A cat killer is being hunted after at least six pets were poisoned in a week in the same street. The cats became severely disorientated and behaved as though drunk before collapsing and dying. Tests showed that each had consumed antifreeze and the RSPCA believes they were killed intentionally. Other owners in Albert Street in Padiham, near Burnley, fear their pets are at risk. Emma and Cadie Mayor are two of the residents on Albert Street in . Padiham, near Burnley, whose beloved cat died after drinking antifreeze . which the RSPCA believe was used deliberately to poison the pets . Emma Mayor, 34, whose cat Gizmo was one of those to die, said: ‘We just thought he must have just found the antifreeze somewhere and drank it but who would be using antifreeze in June? 'Now we know that six have died altogether so someone must be doing it deliberately.' She had to take her pet . Gizmo to the vet after he appeared to be ‘drunk’ and was struggling to . walk or stand up. Miss Mayor was told there was nothing that could . be done and he had to be put down. She said the terraced street in Padiham in Lancashire used to be known . as ‘Cat Street’ due to the high number of felines living there. But the numbers have been decimated by a cruel campaign to wipe them out. She said: ‘Gizmo wasn’t just a cat, he was the love . of my life. I got him when my mother died and he cheered me up and just . became part of the family. He was my little boy. I’m devastated by . what’s happened.’ Miss Mayor's cat Gizmo had to be taken to the vet after appearing 'drunk' and struggling to walk or stand up. The vet had to put Gizmo down, saying there was nothing they could do to help . Vivien Storey, 44, whose cat Diesel died . last week, only realised there was something wrong when her 14-year-old . pet tried to jump over a wall, fell and had a fit. Vivien Storey, 44, another resident on the street, also had to watch her cat Diesel die after she drunk the poison . ‘It upset me that much that I went outside into the street to try to find someone to help me. I just couldn’t look at her, it was breaking my heart. ‘I rang my husband and he came home and wrapped her in a towel and took her to the vets,’ Mrs Storey said yesterday. ‘She said it was the same symptoms as other cats in the street and that we’d have to have her put to sleep.’ The RSPCA is also investigating the poisoning of cats in nearby Nelson. Inspector Charlotte Booker said: ‘This is a horrendous act of cruelty against pets that are much-loved and it will not be tolerated. We also want to urge all cat owners in these areas to be vigilant and to look out for the symptoms of poisoning. ‘ . She said cats who display tell-tale symptoms of anti-freeze poisoning can be treated and recover if they are taken to the vet within the first 24 hours. ‘Cats often look as though they are drunk and struggle to move around as normal,’ she said. ’If anyone notices any of these symptoms, please get your cat to the vets straight away.’ Under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 offenders face a six month jail sentence or a fine of up to £20,000 if convicted.","The poisoned cats all lived on Albert Street in Padiham, near Burnley .

"By . Julian Robinson . and Jaya Narain . A girl who wouldn’t stop talking during a lesson had her mouth Sellotaped shut by a teacher. Elise Smith, 11, was forced to sit for 15 minutes with tape stuck across her mouth as a punishment for chatting to other pupils. The classroom humiliation ended when the science teacher realised he should not have done it and the tape was taken off her mouth. 'Chatterbox': Elise Smith, pictured left with her father Marc, had her mouth taped shut by a teacher at William Allitt School in Derbyshire because she would not stop talking . Last night Elise’s father Marc Smith . condemned the teacher for holding his daughter up to ridicule in front . of the class. He also lambasted the secondary school for failing to take . tougher disciplinary measures against him. Furious . Mr Smith has lodged a complaint with the school, which has recently . been placed in special measures, as well as the local education . authority and Ofsted. School governors have called the teacher’s actions ‘misguided’ and he is understood to have apologised to the youngster and her family - but no further disciplinary action was taken. Mr Smith spoke out after the school was recently placed into special measures following a damning Ofsted inspection report. He said: 'The children were all talking in class and were told to be quiet, but my daughter kept on talking. He should just have sent her out. You cannot lay a finger on children. Elise with her parents Becky and Marc: Mr Smith, who lives in Woodville, Derbyshire, said he was angry that the teacher was never suspended and remains at the school. However, they have sent their daughter back . The William Allitt School, described on its website as a specialist college for performing arts and science, was recently placed in special measures after a damning Ofsted inspection report . Sellotape was used by a teacher to tape up Elise Smith's mouth because the youngster did not stop talking after being told to keep quiet (file picture) 'I was at . work when it happened, but my daughter told me when I got home and the . next morning I went to the school. I was fuming.' At . the time of the incident, former head teacher Mike McCandless had to . get both sides of the story and took written statements from other . pupils at the school. Mr Smith, who lives in Woodville, Derbyshire, said he was angry that the teacher in question was never suspended and remains at the school. He said: 'The teacher apologised but has not been punished enough, in my opinion, because he didn’t get suspended and is still working at that school. 'I heard about teachers in another school doing it and they were suspended, so why not here?' He said he was reluctant to send his child back to the school, but did so after she said she was missing her friends. Jean Mead, Chairman of governors at William Allitt School, said: 'The welfare of pupils is always our top priority. 'This was a misguided action rather than a malicious one. 'It happened in December last year. It shouldn’t have taken place under any circumstances - the teacher immediately regretted his actions and apologised. 'We worked alongside the local authority to carry out a thorough investigation and appropriate action was taken.'","Teacher taped Elise Smith's mouth shut because she would not stop talking .

"By . Jaya Narain . Miraculous: Kate Weaver, pictured with her newborn son Toby, gave birth while still paralysed . A woman who had a stroke days before she was due to have a baby gave birth to her son while still paralysed. Nurse Kate Weaver was out shopping when she realised she was having a stroke. She managed to tell her husband: ‘We need to go to hospital. It’s not the baby, I’m really ill’ – moments before losing her ability to speak  and move. Doctors managed to stabilise her, but the family was faced with an agonising choice of whether to undergo a life-saving procedure which posed risks for both mother and baby. The procedure, called thrombolysis, involves the administration of a clot-busting drug. It had never been performed on a pregnant woman at the hospital – and there was a risk of Mrs Weaver and her baby  suffering a brain haemorrhage. However, the family decided to go ahead. Mrs Weaver recovered her speech within four hours but remained almost totally paralysed down her left side. Then just three days later with the help of an epidural, her son Toby was born weighing 6lb 11oz. Such was the scale of Mrs Weaver’s stroke, in September last year, that she had to learn to walk again. Toby was allowed to go home at a week old and his mother joined him at the family home in Wem, Shropshire, a week later where she began the long road to recovery. Now just ten months on, Mrs Weaver and her mechanic husband, Tim, 36,  are delighted with the extent of her recovery. Mrs . Weaver, a haematology nurse at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital where she . gave birth, said: ‘I can’t describe it how scary having a stroke and . knowing that I was about to give birth was – I didn’t think I was going . to make it. Healthy: Mrs Weaver recovered fully from her stroke - which left her unable to walk or speak - and her son is developing normally . ‘I was very lucky knowing exactly what was happening to me so we could act quickly. ‘But having so much knowledge made it so much worse because I knew what might happen.’ The drama began when 29-year-old Mrs Weaver thought she had cramps while out shopping. She sat down to rest but, unable to push herself up with her left arm, realised she was having a stroke. Filled with dread for her unborn baby, she managed to alert her husband before becoming paralysed. Mrs Weaver . believes if she had not been with her husband she might not have . reached hospital in time. She said: ‘I knew straight away what was going . on in my body. ‘If . I’d been at home on my own I just don’t know what would have happened. Toby’s a little miracle and he’s developing absolutely fine.’ Healthy: Toby, pictured left with his father Tim, and right with Mrs Weaver, developed like any other healthy baby . Treatment: Mrs Weaver had to stay in hospital for a week longer than her son, and needed lengthy physiotherapy in order to walk again . She added: ‘I’m a nurse and it still shocks me that someone so young could have a stroke. There was a risk to him when I was thrombolysed but who knows what would have happened if I hadn’t been?’ Although her speech had returned, she remained partially paralysed and has been undergoing therapy to regain her movement. She undertook pioneering electrical impulse treatment at Physiofunction in Northampton to help her walk again. The treatment, targeting the nerves, has been shown to help stroke victims who suffer from movement difficulties. Mrs Weaver, who has now improved to the point where she has been able to return to work, said: ‘Now every milestone for Toby is a milestone for me and an extra feeling of relief we can get back to normal.’","Kate Weaver, 29, left unable to speak or walk while 39 weeks pregnant .

"By . Jaya Narain . Clifford Fleming, 65, who wrote to bank staff demanding £150,000. However, his distinctive handwriting - which police spotted scrawled in a crossword puzzle - gave him away . For detectives on the trail of a blackmailer who threatened to plant a bomb in a busy a town centre, the clue was in the crossword. Because the handwriting on a note demanding staff at Barclays bank leave £150,000 in a bag in an alleyway was very distinctive. And when police visited former soldier and ardent puzzler, Clifford Fleming, 65, they found an exact match in a crossword in a copy of a newspaper. Fleming, a former Army soldier, was beginning a three-year jail sentence after he pleaded guilty to blackmail. The court heard Fleming, 65, had dropped a terrifying handwritten demand into the bank's letter box overnight demanding £150,000 in used notes be left in a bag in an alley. The note read: ‘This is a coded message. A bomb has been timed to explode at 1.30pm in a very busy place in Lancashire unless you follow this request to the letter. ‘Multiple deaths and injuries will occur unless you follow these demands.  Our people will be listening to the police and watching you. Don’t try to be a hero or carnage will ensue.’ Bank staff who opened it in the morning initially believed it was a prank but became concerned and decided to call their regional office. The worker spoke to her manager who told her to inform police immediately and detectives, counter-terrorism officers and intelligence officers were scrambled to the picturesque village of Billington. In the letter, Fleming, a father-of-four, had ordered bank staff to deposit the cash in a bag placed at the side of Billington Village Store at 12.15pm . So police officers went to the drop-off location and one minute before the deadline, Fleming was seen walking towards the alleyway. Five minutes later he picked up a carrier bag and walked away. Officers studied CCTV taken from the bank which appeared to show the same man posting a letter to the branch in the overnight box. Fleming was snared by police, who spotted the handwriting on a newspaper crossword, left open on a coffee table at his home, matched that of the blackmail note. Preston Crown Court heard how Fleming . initially denied he was behind the threat but admitted it when they . showed him the similarity between the crossword and the blackmail note. During . a police interview Fleming said he had a gambling addiction and had . racked up huge debts and had lost the equity in his home. Fleming demanded staff at Barclays bank left a bag stuffed with used bank notes next to Billington Village Store in the picturesque Lancashire village - or he'd detonate a bomb. He was sentenced to three years in jail for blackmail . He told them he had squandered a family inheritance, had a £13,000 credit card debt and feared he would not be able to afford healthcare or funeral costs for himself or his ailing wife. Judge Heather Lloyd, sentencing, said: ‘‘You must know, particularly bearing in mind your army background, that in this day and age the authorities have to be particularly wary of threats of bombs and terrorism. ‘It is undoubtedly the case that you were under stress and in debt. You do suffer ill health, both physically and mentally, but how did you think the bank employees were going to react? ‘You wanted them to believe the threat. You made it appear that this wasn’t a plain prank and that there was some sort of organisation behind it. ‘You must know, particularly bearing in mind your army background, that in this day and age the authorities have to be particularly wary of threats of bombs and terrorism. ‘The amount of money said to have been spent is significant. Forty staff and officers were deployed, the duration of the operation was seven hours.’","Police were hunting man who wrote to bank staff demanding £150k ransom .

"By . Jaya Narain . Doreen Mannion, who died after falling down stairs and waiting two-and-a-half hours for an ambulance, is seen here in her heyday as a ballerina in the 1940s . A former ballerina who fell down stairs and broke her leg died after waiting almost two-and-a-half hours for an ambulance, an inquest heard. Doreen Mannion, 85, who had performed with the Sadler’s Wells dance company, was left in agony after the fall at her home last year. But she was not deemed a ‘priority’ by 999 call handlers and was left on a cold floor for two hours and 23 minutes before paramedics eventually arrived. The widow was treated for her fracture but lapsed into a coma and died two months later. An inquest heard the sprightly pensioner, who had done ballet exercises well into her 70s, fell backwards as she went upstairs to bed at her home in Withington, Manchester, in January last year. Mrs Mannion shouted and banged on the inside of her front door to alert passers-by. Three men heard her cries, forced their way in and called 999. Her son Richard, 63, a former NHS worker, told the inquest: ‘I received a call around midnight from a man saying, “You don’t know me but I’m in your mother’s house. She has broken her leg.” ’ The mother of two was in pain and they were afraid to move her in case her back was broken, Mr Mannion said. He told the inquest: ‘The wait didn’t do mother any good. She was on the cold floor and we couldn’t keep her warm. It was the most long and alarming wait … within 24 hours she was in a condition she would not recover from.’ Despite efforts by medical staff the former dance teacher’s condition deteriorated and she lapsed into a coma before developing pneumonia. She died in March last year. Speaking after the hearing Mr Mannion said: ‘She was of that generation that didn’t complain. She was lying there for around two-and-a-half hours on the cold lino. ‘It’s completely unacceptable really … I believe that leaving her lying on the floor for so long did not help. This was the golden hour and I believe my mother was failed by the ambulance service. Richard Mannion, seen here with his mother, at his wedding two years ago, told the inquest the wait for an ambulance was 'the most long and alarming wait' ‘She was in a dreadful state and all we could do was wait.’ The family complained to North West Ambulance Service, believing the delayed emergency treatment was a factor in her death. 'In my opinion, she would not have otherwise died in the circumstances in which she did' - Manchester assistant coroner Graham Jackson . But NWAS sector manager Angela Anne Lee, told the inquest Mrs Mannion’s condition was ‘serious but not immediately life-threatening’ and other emergencies had to take priority on the night. She said that January evening was the busiest of 2013, after New Year’s Eve, with a backlog of ‘grade red’ life-threatening cases, triggered by heavy snowfall causing multiple road accidents and stranding ambulances. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Manchester assistant coroner Graham Jackson said Mrs Mannion’s deterioration was the result of many medical factors, the trigger being the fall. ‘In my opinion, she would not have otherwise died in the circumstances in which she did,’ he said. A NWAS spokesman said it aims to ensure patients get an appropriate response ‘as quickly as possible’, but that ‘factors which are out of our control … can have an impact on our response and contribute to delays’.","Doreen Mannion's son tells of 'long and alarming wait' for ambulance .

"By . Michael Seamark . and Jaya Narain . Lord Steel insisted yesterday that he was ‘perfectly happy’ to recommend Cyril Smith for a knighthood and said ‘a man is innocent until proven guilty’. In an extraordinary defence of his own – and the Liberal Party’s – conduct concerning the serial sex abuser, the peer again insisted he knew  nothing of Smith’s vile activities. Lord Steel claimed he was only aware of a Private Eye article in 1979 detailing how the 29-stone monster spanked young boys’ bare bottoms. Claims: Ex-Liberal leader David Steel (right) Lord Steel said there 'is no question' Cyril Smith (left) would be 'up for assault now', but argued that at the time corporal punishment 'went on' He said he challenged Smith about the allegations – but took no further action. The . former Liberal leader reacted angrily to suggestions that it was . negligent not to pursue ‘gossip and tittle-tattle’ that erupted about . the Rochdale politician after the satirical magazine report. In . a fractious BBC radio interview, he said: ‘We’re a political party, not . a detective agency and idle gossip is not a basis for any inquiry at . all.’ Asked about claims by . fellow Liberal peer Lord Alton that he had ‘facetiously’ said Smith’s . behaviour was no different from conduct at public schools, Lord Steel . said: ‘You say it is a facetious remark. But it happens to be true that . in those days corporal punishment was permitted.’ Labour . MP Simon Danczuk, whose book revealed the full extent of Smith’s abuse . of young boys, said: ‘It is quite clear from Lord Steel’s response that . there was no appetite to get to the heart of the very serious rumours . that were circulating about Cyril Smith. Lord Steel said he confronted Cyril Smith over his 'unusual behavior' at a hostel in Rochdale . ‘The . general public will be very disappointed that, as the leader of a . political party with just over a dozen MPs at the time, he did not want . to thoroughly investigate. ‘This . wasn’t about idle gossip, this wasn’t about an MP who had had a few too . many pints or an extra-marital affair, this was about one of his MPs . having sex with children.’ Mr . Danczuk, whose book Smile for the Camera: The Double Life of Cyril . Smith was serialised in the Mail this month, added: ‘Now he can describe . it as idle gossip and rumour but the wider public will be truly . horrified and take it very seriously.’ Lord . Steel’s interview comes amid growing calls for a public inquiry into . the scandal over Sir Cyril Smith’s four decades of child abuse. On . Monday police announced a fresh probe into an alleged cover-up of . Smith’s activities in Rochdale. Yet . senior Lib Dems including Nick Clegg continue to claim they knew little . of the true extent of Smith’s abuse. Mr Clegg has said he sees no need . for an internal inquiry. But . Mr Danczuk, whose book tells of appalling events at Knowl View . residential school in Rochdale, says there is clear evidence of an . establishment cover-up and an internal investigation is needed. Kevin . Griffiths, who was 14 when he was molested by Smith in a Rochdale . hostel in 1964, said yesterday: ‘Lord Steel was told Cyril Smith  had . skeletons in his closet, heard about the rumours and yet he failed to . conduct his own investigation. Despite these accusations he  suggests . Smith could be innocent until proven guilty which I find insulting.’ Deciding to speak publicly for the first time since the scandal erupted . 17 days ago, Lord Steel – who led the Liberals between 1976 and 1988 – . admitted he challenged Smith saying: ‘What’s all this in Private Eye?’ and he said: ‘Yes, the report is true.’ Private Eye went on to say the . police had investigated but no further action had been taken. He . told World at One presenter Martha Kearney: ‘This was a different era, . corporal punishment was permitted. It would be totally illegal now, . there is no question he would be up for assault now but in those days it . went on. Demand: Lord Steel's interview comes amid growing calls for a public inquiry into the scandal over Sir Cyril Smith¿s four decades of child abuse . Probe: On Monday police announced a fresh probe into an alleged cover-up of Smith's activities in Rochdale . ‘These were . allegations that were ten to 15 years old. Since then and, after the . closure of one of these institutions, he had gone on to be elected . mayor, he was awarded the MBE by the Labour Party for services to local . government. I had no locus in the matter at all.’ He . dismissed claims he should have done more to investigate, saying: ‘Why . should I? There was no allegation about his behaviour as an MP. There . are now allegations which have come to light since his death and these . are very serious but they were not known to us.’ He . admitted he did not ask the police or the Liberal party in Rochdale . about the allegations. ‘They were ancient allegations about his time as a . local councillor, nothing to do with his life as an MP and anything . that has emerged since was not known to me or to anybody else.’ Allegations: Lord Steel claimed he was only aware of a Private Eye article in 1979 detailing how the 29-stone monster spanked young boys' bare bottoms . Lord . Steel defended recommending Smith for a knighthood, despite the . rumours. He said: ‘He had been the distinguished MP for the area for 15 . years, he had announced he wasn’t standing again, he was in poor health, . his life expectancy was unknown – many MPs got knighthoods at 14 and 15 . years and I was perfectly happy with that.’ Asked . if Smith should have been prosecuted, Lord Steel said: ‘It sounds as . though he should have been, yes, and certainly if these things happened . today he would undoubtedly be prosecuted. ‘A . man is innocent until proved guilty.

"By . Jaya Narain . Louise Coulter scammed £40,000 in state handouts over four and a half years - but was given a 20-week sentence . A judge has condemned ‘ludicrously low’ guidelines for sentencing welfare fraudsters after handing one woman a punishment that would see her clear the debt only if she lived to 105. Judge Beverley Lunt’s comments came after she ordered mother-of-two Louise Coulter to pay back £40,000 in fraudulent benefits. Coulter, 38, can afford to pay only £10.95 a week, meaning it would take her a total of 67 years to repay the taxpayer. Judge Lunt also said the guidelines fail to act as a deterrent, as people assume they will escape prison if they are convicted of fiddling the benefit system. She handed Coulter a sentence of 20 weeks in prison, the most severe punishment she could impose under current guidelines. Coulter could be free after serving only ten weeks behind bars if she maintains good behaviour, and that could be further reduced to just five weeks if she is deemed suitable for an electronic tag. Judge Lunt said: ‘The guideline sentences set down by the Sentencing Council, which judges must follow, are so ludicrously low that everyone thinks the sentences will automatically be suspended.’ She told Coulter it was unlikely that the stolen money would ever be recovered, and said the payback scheme was ‘clearly not acting as a deterrent’. Custodial terms for those who plead not guilty can range between 12 weeks and 18 months depending on the amount of money stolen and the length of time over which the fraud took place. Those who plead guilty, saving the cost of a trial, can expect reductions of around a third on their jail terms – and will often serve just half of their reduced sentence. Coulter claimed thousands in income support, housing and council tax benefits after falsely claiming her boyfriend, John Wilcox, had moved out . Burnley Crown Court heard Coulter claimed income support, housing and council tax benefits. She signed a form declaring that she was single and said she had no income other than child tax credits and child benefits. Judge Beverley Lunt said the sentencing guidelines were 'ludicrously low' and appeared not to be deterring benefits cheat . But Julian Goode, prosecuting, said surveillance was carried out on her home which showed her 45-year-old partner John Wilcox going to and from the address. His car was usually found either parked outside the house or at his workplace at a logistics firm. Further investigations found Mr Wilcox’s car was insured at that address and the couple had a house insurance policy together. Neighbours said Coulter bragged of buying new widescreen televisions, a three-piece suite and a gas cooker worth around £1,000. When she was caught, Coulter – who has two children aged eight and 13 – pleaded guilty to three counts of dishonestly failing to notify a change in circumstances. But she told officers from the Department of Work and Pensions that committing welfare fraud was an ‘easy option’. Judge Lunt told her: ‘Too many people like you think it’s the easy option. You have no thought for those people who were in genuine need of the money that you defrauded.’ Last night one of Coulter’s neighbours said: ‘I think the judge was right, it is ludicrous. If I had done something like that I would expect to go to jail for a substantial time. The council house she claimed the money from in Barclay Avenue, Burnley, Lancashire, has since been boarded up . Judge Beverley Lunt slammed the sentence she was forced to give Coulter at Burnley Crown Court, pictured . Under sentencing guidelines, defendants over 18 who are convicted after a trial of fiddling around £60,000 state benefits after initially making a legitimate claim for welfare will usually face 36 weeks in jail. The custodial terms for those who plead not guilty can range between 12 weeks and 18 months depending on the amount of money stolen and the length of time over which the fraud took place. Those who plead guilty and spare the cost of running a jury trial can expect reductions of around a third on proposed jail terms - and will serve just half that. ‘I would expect more than a slap on the wrist. It doesn’t give out a very good message to people. It’s terrible she has got away with what she has done but I’m not surprised. 'Nothing surprises me about the justice system these days.’ A woman who claimed benefits for agoraphobia while travelling the world has been jailed for a year. Tracy Johnson, 52, said she was so unwell that she could not leave her house in the Welsh town of Builth Wells. But she went to India, New York, Argentina and Madrid while claiming benefits of £50,000. Andrew Penhale, prosecuting, said: ‘This is one of the worst cases of benefit fraud we have seen. Making a false claim to suffer from agoraphobia undermines those who suffer from this debilitating condition.’","Louise Coulter scammed £38,000 in state handouts in more than four years .

After Mrs Foulkes died, a besotted Mr Foulkes allegedly raided his bank account to wine and dine the police officer, now 47, over ten years. They embarked on a sexual relationship, with Stretton urging him to buy condoms and Viagra, it is claimed. Murdered: Mr Foulkes's son Colin, 49, was hacked to death in 2001 by schizophrenic lodger John Latus . His family say Mr Foulkes transferred at least £11,500 into the police officer’s bank account, as well as frittering away more than £60,000 in cash. His three daughters say they told West Mercia Police about the ‘inappropriate’ affair in 2002, 2006 and 2007, but nothing was done to stop it. They have now lodged a writ at the High Court seeking reparations of £100,000 from Stretton as well as unspecified damages for ‘serious distress’. In January, three years after Mr Foulkes died at 92, Stretton was questioned on suspicion of misconduct in a public office. A review is also being carried out by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). Last night, Mr Foulkes’s  daughter Michele Pugh, 66, of Craven Arms, Shropshire, said: ‘We know that strumpet persuaded and encouraged our father to spend large amounts of money on her. 'I was shocked when my father, in his eighties, started asking me about Viagra, but it was only after his death that we discovered his supply of pills and condoms.’ The retired painter and decorator met Stretton when she was assigned as his family liaison officer after his son, Colin, 49, was hacked to death in 2001 by schizophrenic lodger John Latus, then 31, who was jailed for life. The pensioner, a bell-ringer at his local church, became wealthy after inheriting his son’s estate. His housebound wife, who referred to Stretton as his ‘bit of fluff’, died a few months later. Family: Mr Foulkes's family say Stretton knew the pensioner (pictured with his son) was rich and vulnerable. The pair sent text messages, with one from Stretton allegedly reading: 'I love you so very much darling' As the relationship with Stretton . allegedly became sexual, Mr Foulkes went on a diet and asked his teenage . grandson for tips on how to look trendy. Mr Foulkes’s youngest daughter, Carla Kelly, 50, said: ‘When he was dying in hospital she never once turned up, but I suppose he couldn’t get to the cash machine from his bed.’ Her sister, Charmaine Jones, 56, said: ‘Even on his death bed he kept looking at his phone, just waiting for her text or call. Case: The family have now lodged a writ at London's High Court (pictured) seeking reparations and damages . 'All too late it dawned on him what had happened, but he still kept looking at his phone like a lovestruck teenager waiting for a call.’ West Mercia Police said it had conducted an investigation but it would not comment before the IPCC had reviewed its findings. Stretton, of Telford, Shropshire, refused to comment. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","PC Clare Stretton, 37, was sent to comfort 82-year-old Charles Foulkes .

"By . Jaya Narain . A boy of ten raped a classmate in the toilets of his primary school as he ‘acted out’ scenes from online pornography, a court was told. The jury heard that he approached a fellow pupil during an English lesson and asked if he wanted to have sex with him. Thinking he was joking, the other boy replied: ‘No way.’ But after the lesson the alleged victim went to the toilets and, as he went to leave, the defendant was said to have walked in and grabbed him. Allegations: A 10-year-old boy has been accused of raping a classmate, also aged 10, in the toilets of a school in Colwyn Bay. The boy has pleaded not guilty to two charges. The trial is being held at Mold Crown Court . The court heard the boy then pushed him over a sink and raped him. The victim, also 10, told him to stop and after about 10 seconds the alleged attacker pulled away, and apparently said: ‘Oh come on, the party’s just starting.’ Yesterday Mold Crown Court in North Wales was told the schoolboy had carried out the rape after watching pornography online. Karl Scholz, prosecuting, said: ‘It is almost certain that in this case what was being done was to act out what had been seen in pornographic material.’ He said the jury may conclude that what lay behind the alleged incident was the availability of pornography on the internet. ‘It is that which may lie behind the corruption of the minds of the people involved in this case,’ said Mr Scholz. The accused boy, who is now 12, faces a charge of rape and a second charge of inciting his classmate to engage in sexual activity. The alleged rape happened at a primary school in Colwyn Bay. The boy was so embarrassed that he might be branded homosexual he did not tell anyone until he was interviewed by teachers over a separate incident. The boy also claimed that on another occasion the defendant and another boy pretended to be gay in the toilets, kissing each other. Each was said to have exposed himself and the complainant was told to carry out a sex act on the one he preferred. He alleged that he was grabbed by the second boy and his head was pushed down before he broke free and ran off. The other boy was not before the court. Campaign: The Mail is pressing for tighter controls on internet porn, which is viewed by many under-18s . Mr Scholz claimed that in a further incident the defendant tried to pull the boy’s trousers down as he washed his hands after using the toilet and when the boy would not let him the defendant allegedly asked him: ‘Why not? It’s fun.’ The court heard that in March last year the alleged victim was spoken to by teachers following rumours in the school that he had touched his girlfriend intimately. The boy claimed he made up the story to impress his friends, but it was while teachers were speaking to him about the issue that he accused the defendant of rape. That night he told his parents and the matter was reported to the police. The alleged victim told officers that the defendant was a bully in the playground. Mr Scholz said the complainant would not go into the playground during break times to avoid being picked on. The accused boy admitted to police that he had been mean to his classmate on occasions but said he had not bullied him. He told police he had never asked him for sex and nothing of sexual nature had ever happened between them. The defendant said he had asked the alleged victim once for a date but said it was a joke and later told him he had ‘dumped him’. The case continues. The Mail is campaigning for tighter controls on internet pornography. We reported on Monday that a new system is to be introduced in which users of UK-based porn websites will have to prove they are over 18.

"By . Jaya Narain . Once the exclusive preserve of science fiction, manufacturers have promised motorists that space age cars will soon become science fact. The quest for effortless travelling will take a major new step forward when 'gesture control' motoring is unveiled. Car manufacturers are working on a system that will allow drivers to many of the internal controls by moving their hands close to sensor panels. The new 'gesture control' is being pioneered by several manufacturers with Land Rover unveiling a mock-up at the New York motor show (file picture) The system will enable motorists to operate lights, indicators and open and close doors all with a simple gesture. It will also mean the end to door handles as the person holding the keys will be able to open the car doors by a swiping movement. The move is the latest in a series of technological advances that are set to revolutionise motoring. But there are fears blank key fobs could be programmed by hacking through the security system in the car's computer to allow thieves to drive the vehicle away. The new 'gesture control' is being pioneered by several manufacturers with Land Rover unveiling a mock-up at the New York motor show. The vehicle featured doors without handles and no indicators with both being operated by gestures. Drivers of the Mercedes SL are already able to open their boots when they waggle a foot under the rear bumper (file picture) The technology works by using cameras to capture the driver's movements with software interpreting specific hand movements and then passing the information on to the car' computer. Dr Wolfgang Epple, research and technology director at Jaguar Land Rover, told the Sunday Times: 'For safety reasons some functions will be hardwired with switches, but many others could be operated by gesture control. 'We recognise that it is substantially more intuitive to use gestures than to press a button or turn a switch.' A number of different controls are being developed for 'gesture' software with manufacturers saying windows, indicators, door locking and turning lights on and off could all be part of the new system. Some 'gesture control' is already used in cars with drivers of the Mercedes SL able to open their boots when they waggle a foot under the rear bumper. Ford has also applied for a patent for a swipe gesture system to lower or raise a window. Roderick Murray-Smith, professor of computing science at Glasgow University, who previously worked for Mercedes, laid down a warning saying: 'Its use has to be carefully tuned for cars. 'If you wave your hand in annoyance at a car going by and suddenly the music's blasting at you, it could be distracting enough to be dangerous.'","Technology works by using cameras to capture the driver's movements .

"By . Daniel Martin . and Jaya Narain . Campaign: Calls are growing for an independent inquiry into Cyril Smith, pictured in 1971, as his victims demand 'proper justice' The Liberal Democrats faced growing demands last night for an independent inquiry into the Cyril Smith paedophilia scandal. MPs, campaigners and lawyers for the victims dismissed Nick Clegg’s ‘legalistic’ attempts to deny responsibility on the grounds that the horrifying abuse happened before he was party leader. They criticised Mr Clegg’s cursory initial investigation into Smith’s activities in 2012 – which the Lib Dem leader said had not found evidence that the party knew of the predatory politician’s four decades of molesting children. Sir Alistair Graham, former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said the Lib Dems had ‘not got a good record in this area’. And he said the party should set up an independent probe because they were ‘relying on internal people who may have a vested interest in arriving at a particular conclusion’. He also criticised Mr Clegg for making a ‘legalistic’ distinction between the Liberal Party and the Liberal Democrats who were formed in 1989 following a merger between the Liberals and the Social Democratic Party. ‘People would see a political continuum from the Liberals to the Liberal Democrats,’ Sir Alistair said.‘In an organisational sense, many of the same people were there, so it is appropriate to properly investigate whether there had been any wrongdoing at that time.’ Solicitor Alan Collins of law firm Slater and Gordon, who is representing six men abused by Smith as boys, echoed Sir Alistair’s call for an independent probe. He said it was ‘inconceivable’ that senior Liberals heard nothing about the allegations. Mr Clegg said on Tuesday that Lib Dem whips contacted every current MP and peer and trawled through all the party’s records after Smith’s vile sexual abuse was finally exposed by Labour MP Simon Danczuk in Parliament in 2012. No one admitted to hearing anything about the allegations – even though former Liberal leader David Steel was told in 1979 about complaints that Smith had abused boys. And a Lib Dem spokesman later admitted . the archives that were searched contained material dating almost . exclusively from after the party’s formation in 1989. Under pressure: Nick Clegg, pictured during an interview on LBC 97.3, has been criticised for making 'legalistic' excuses over the Cyril Smith scandal . The records examined did not include documents from the old Liberal Party to which Smith belonged when he was elected as MP for Rochdale in 1972. He served for 20 years until 1992 by which time he was a Liberal Democrat, and died in 2010 aged 82. Martin Bell, the former BBC reporter and anti-sleaze MP, said the Lib Dems should follow the example of the BBC over Jimmy Savile and hold a proper inquiry into how Smith’s sex abuse was allowed to continue unchecked for so long. More than 7,500 people have signed a new online petition calling on David Cameron to launch a public inquiry into Smith’s sexual abuse so that his victims can get ‘proper justice’. Lord Steel, who nominated Smith for a knighthood in 1988, refused to comment when approached by the Daily Mail on Tuesday. He has previously said that he received no complaints about Smith’s activities as a Liberal MP and that the obese politician denied any wrongdoing when he questioned him in 1979 about the allegations of ‘unusual behaviour with boys’. A Liberal Democrat spokesman said last night: ‘Cyril Smith’s acts were vile and repugnant and we have nothing but sympathy for those whose lives he ruined. His actions were not known to, or condoned by, the Liberal Party or the Liberal Democrats. ‘These are extremely serious allegations and include suggestions that there was a cover-up by the police and security services. ‘Allegations made in the Daily Mail and elsewhere also include prominent members of the Labour and Conservative parties. ‘Such serious allegations, involving a range of institutions, must be a matter for the police.’ Open secret: Campaigners argue that rumours of Smith's abuse of young boys were widely known both in Westminster and his constituency . Fresh evidence that rumours of Cyril Smith’s sickening activities were widely known emerged yesterday, raising damaging new questions for Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats. It was alleged that claims that Smith abused boys were raised on the floor of a Liberal Party conference, but that nothing was done about it. Separately, a former campaigner for the Social Democratic Party described how senior party officials panicked during the 1983 election because of fears Smith would be exposed as a child abuser. The SDP was in an electoral alliance with the Liberal Party, which Smith represented as MP for Rochdale, and would later merge with it to form the Liberal Democrats. Charles Baker, an SDP activist in Hertfordshire, said a warning came down from party headquarters in London. ‘There was kind of an alert, an alarm that one of the other parties had got hold of the fact that Cyril Smith had interfered with boys yet again,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. 'Turning a blind eye': It is alleged that claims about Smith, pictured relaxing in a deckchair at Brighton ahead of a party conference, abusing boys was raised on the floor of a Liberal Party conference but no action was taken . Meanwhile, new details were also revealed yesterday of Smith’s fears that he would be ruined when a local Rochdale newspaper published an article in 1979 disclosing that the police had investigated complaints that he abused boys at a hostel in the town. Elwyn Watkins, who was 15 and working for Smith’s election campaign team at the time, recalled that Smith was terrified of the effect the story would have on his political career if it was followed up by national newspapers. ‘He said something along the lines of “this will destroy me”. He was white as a sheet,’ he said. But about two days later Smith’s brother Norman walked into the campaign office and said they had ‘seen to it that the story would go nowhere’. Mr Watkins added: ‘After that day, Cyril was back to his old self.’ Labour MP for Rochdale Simon Danczuk told the BBC yesterday he believed the rumours of Smith’s activities were raised at a Liberal Party conference. He said: ‘I spoke to a Liberal student activist from the mid-70s who said these allegations actually got raised on the floor of conference for the Liberals. Lots of people are aware of it.’ Mr Danczuk, author of an explosive new book about the cover-up of Smith’s abuse serialised by the Daily Mail, said the rumours were well known in Rochdale. He also alleged that Smith was protected in Westminster because he was part of a ‘paedophile network’ there after becoming an MP in 1972. He said he believed it included other senior figures – and that to have exposed it could have toppled the government.","Cyril Smith was a member of the Liberal Party when he was first elected .

"By . Jaya Narain . Pictured is MP Nigel Evans arriving at Preston Crown Court  for his ongoing trial for sexual assault and rape of several men, and denies all charges . A Westminster worker was raped by MP Nigel Evans but did not report the alleged attack because he ‘didn’t want to have a bad relationship with the deputy speaker’, a court was told yesterday. The parliamentary worker told the jury the former Conservative MP had followed him to bed after a drunken evening at Evans’ constituency home. He texted a friend from the bathroom saying: ‘Please help me’ minutes before Evans is alleged to have raped him in bed. But the man, who is gay, told a jury he did not report the incident because he did not want to fall out with Evans. At Preston Crown Court, Mark Heywood QC, asked him why after texting from the bathroom he had then returned to the bedroom and got back into bed with the MP. He replied: ‘I did not want there to be a situation between us. I did not want to have a bad relationship with the Deputy Speaker. I thought he was asleep.’ The court heard the alleged incident happened in March 2013 during a drunken night out in the MPs Ribble Valley constituency hometown of Pendleton, Lancashire. The man, who was 21 at the time, and other guests had been invited to the constituency house for a party. After a dinner, where they had drunk champagne, wine, gin and port, they went next door to a pub where they drank more drinks before returning to the house. The man claims he had then allowed Evans, 56, to escort him into the main bedroom and had undressed to his boxer shorts before climbing into bed with the MP. He told the jury: ‘With hindsight, it was stupid. I did not think it would lead to anything. I had shared beds with friends as a student and it had not meant anything.’ He said Evans had asked ‘ Shall we have a cuddle’ and had tried to put his hands down the young man’s boxer shorts, telling him ‘You’re gorgeous.’ The witness said Evans was trying to kiss him but the he had ’scrunched’ up his face to stop him. He told the court he repeatedly told Evans he was tired and reminded the MP that he had to go to church the following morning. The Westminster worker said he then went to the bathroom where he sent text messages to a friend, who also later claimed he was attacked by Evans in his constituency home on an earlier occasion. Pictured is MP Nigel Evans arriving at Preston Crown Court with former Coranation Street actress Vicky Entwistle . One text read: ‘Please help me. Nigel has tried to stick his tongue down my throat three times.’ The jury heard he received a response text from his friend who said: ‘Punch him or leave.‘ . The friend then advised the man to go upstairs to the loft bedroom because ‘Nigel will be too p****d to negotiate the stairs.’ Instead, the court heard, the man went back to bed where Evans subjected him to a series of sex acts. The man said he went to sleep and later woke up to find the deputy speaker was raping him. Explaining why he did not push him off, he explained: ‘I froze. I couldn’t move. I felt disattached from my body. I felt shock.‘ . When Evans went for a shower the man said he got dressed and quietly left the house, walking for almost an hour to get to a local train station. Evans resigned as deputy speaker of the House of Commons last September after being charged and now sits as an Independent MP for Ribble Valley. He denies two indecent assaults, six sexual assaults and one rape against seven separate men all aged in their 20s. The case continues.

"By . Jaya Narain . A prisoner tried to sue for compensation after claiming he had rolled off his bunk bed in his sleep. Drug dealer Callum Foster tried to claim £6,000 in damages after he alleged that he had been injured after falling from a bunk bed . Drug dealer, Callum Foster, 22, launched a bid for up to £6,000 in damages saying he had suffered head injuries at the Category A prison in Manchester. But the hapless convict was convicted of fraud and handed an extra nine months on his original sentence. Foster will serve the sentence on top of the three years he is already serving for peddling heroin. Yesterday a prison insider said: ‘The stupidity of some people really knows no bounds. ‘It begs belief that while serving a sentence for one crime he would try to commit another of such crass idiocy - he quite clearly hasn’t learned the lesson yet.’ Callum Foster, 22, was jailed last year after being convicted of dealing heroin on the streets of Manchester. But days after being incarcerated he read a lawyer’s advertisement in a prison newspaper and hatched on a plan to sue the authorities for up to £6,000. He claimed he had suffered a nasty bump to his head after he accidentally rolled out of his top bunk bed while asleep and fell five feet to the floor of his cell. Foster even told prison wardens he had carried on sleeping and had not woken up despite the fall. But his cunning plan came unstitched when medical records revealed he already had a bump on his head before the accident was supposed to have happened. Foster, of Blackley, Manchester denied fraud at Manchester Crown Court but was found guilty after a trial. The court heard that on April Fool's Day last year Foster, while on remand for assault charges, was restrained for thuggish behaviour towards staff and when a nurse saw him later she noted a bump on his head. But in June last year, while Foster was back in the prison for the supply of heroin, the prison authorities got a letter from personal injury lawyers Michael Jefferies, which claimed Foster had fallen from his bunk and sustained injuries to his neck, shoulder, back and head. Foster hadn’t complained of any injuries at the time of the bogus fall and had not alerted staff. The claim, the court heard, was worth about £6,000 - but could have cost the taxpayer up to £35,000 to defend. Strangeways’ prison litigation team, which the court heard deals with 120 claims of this type at ‘any given time’, called in Greater Manchester Police’s prison crime specialist to investigate Foster, before pursuing him for fraud. Foster claimed that he had sustained head injuries after falling from a five foot bunk bed inside Strangeways prison (pictured) Foster claimed in his trial that despite falling five feet to the ground, he continued sleeping, only realising he had fallen when his cellmate told him. His compensation claim alleged negligence because there was no safety rail on the bed. The court heard he has previous convictions stretching back to 2007, including for grievous bodily harm, . John Wolfson, defending, said of Foster’s offence: ‘He gained nothing from it apart from a criminal conviction.’ Handing him a further nine months behind bars, Judge Robert Atherton told Foster: ‘No-one should be under any illusion about the lack of resources public services have. ‘Any such drain on public resources is to be abhorred - particularly by someone who has such an anti-social history as you have, with the convictions you have.’ Foster has now been handed a total of three years nine months behind bars after being found guilty of fraud. Foster is being held at Strangeways Category A prison in Manchester (pictured here) Compensation payments to prisoners cost the taxpayer up to £13million each year. But prison authorities now have specialist legal teams who are called in to root out fraudulent claims. Last year Noel Jennings, 23, claimed he had slipped on water outside his cell at Strangeways prison and hit his head . He, tried to sue for £6,000 but his scam was uncovered by prison bosses and he was jailed for two years for perverting the course of justice following a hearing at Manchester Crown Court. In 2012, one prisoner who had taken part in a rooftop protest at a prison in Belfast attempted to sue because he got sunburn. Drugs baron Simon Price, 68, an Orthodox Jew who was jailed for trying to smuggle £35million worth of cocaine into Britain, launched legal action last year for £2,500 compensation against Frankland Prison in Durham for failing to provide him with equipment to cook Kosher meals.

"By . Jaya Narain . When Barbara Woodhouse famously ordered dog-owners to bark ‘Sit!’ and ‘Walkies!’ at their pets, they all obeyed. But new evidence suggests that a gentler approach might be better for our four-legged friends. The strict training methods championed by Mrs Woodhouse in the 1970s and 1980s might even do more harm than good. Trainer: When Barbara Woodhouse famously ordered dog-owners to bark 'Sit!' at their pets, they all obeyed, but new evidence suggests that a gentler approach might be better . Experts say efforts to gain the upper hand over a dog could cause it mental trauma and have an impact on its long-term welfare. A study claims pets that are trained using such ‘aversive’ techniques are far more likely to show symptoms of stress than those trained using more  positive methods. It found that giving pets a treat as a reward for good behaviour and using a softer voice led to happier animals – and a better relationship with their owners. Famous: Mrs Woodhouse, who died in 1988 at the age of 78, became a household name with her TV series Training Dogs the Woodhouse Way . The findings cast doubt on the widely . used dog-training programme advocated by Mrs Woodhouse, who claimed . there were ‘no bad dogs’ – only bad owners who failed to assert . themselves over their pets. The . research, published in the Journal of Veterinary Behaviour, involved . monitoring two dog training schools working with a cross-section of . breeds and ages. One relied . primarily on ‘negative reinforcement’, in which pets were encouraged to . perform tasks using harsh tactics such as having their collar pulled. The other school involved ‘positive reinforcement’, with dogs receiving treats or being petted, praised and played with when they obediently performed a task. The two groups were then observed undertaking simple tasks, such as being told to sit. Sixty-five per cent of dogs trained using the negative reinforcement methods showed signs of stress – such as mouth-licking, shaking or whining – compared with just 8 per cent in the ‘positive’ group. Dogs trained with rewards were also far more likely to gaze at their owner – a sign of a healthy relationship. Dr Florence Gaunet, from Aix Marseille University in France, who led the study, told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘What we noticed is that it was bad for the relationship to be trained “negatively”. ‘These dogs were more likely to show a lower posture and more signs of stress.’ But Dr Roger Mugford, an animal psychologist and author of The  Perfect Dog, said relying on ‘positive’ training could lead to spoilt and badly behaved pets. Mrs Woodhouse, who died in 1988 at the age of 78, became a household name with her TV series Training Dogs the Woodhouse Way.","New evidence suggests a gentler approach might be better for pets .

But last weekend, the din gave way to deafening silence for a campaign against intimidation.

The Silent Weekend, planned by Lancashire Football Association, saw 1,000 games played in almost total quiet. Silence: The Silent Weekend, planned by Lancashire Football Association, saw 1,000 games played in almost total silence. It was the first brave new step in a bid to stamp out touchline hostility and intimidation that has plagued junior football for years and led many to walk away from the game . ‘It was an incredible thing,’ said Neil . Yates, Lancashire County FA welfare officer, whose idea it was. ‘Gone . were the sounds of adults screaming and shouting their advice from the . touchline, like a bunch of baying sea lions. It was so refreshing. ‘Instead . the children were able to play the game without the touchline shouting . and pressure that has, frankly, become part of the junior game.’ The initiative aims to change the rowdy . environment of junior football matches so children have the ability to . learn the sport more naturally. It aims to stamp out the bullying . advice they often receive where one parent is screaming for them pass . the ball while another is calling for them to shoot. Some 2,000 teams from 200 clubs signed up. Josh Lennon, whose 11-year-old son plays . for a team that took part said: ‘Some matches were absolutely ridiculous . – the crowd was more like a baying mob and it can be a really . intimidating thing to put your children through. ‘There was a lot of bullying form the touchline with parents scoffing at children and telling them how they should be playing. Refreshing: Neil Yates, Lancashire County FA welfare officer, came up with the idea after he watched an under-nines match last year and saw how terrified one boy was. He said: 'Gone were the sounds of adults screaming and shouting their advice from the touchline, like a bunch of baying sea lions. It was so refreshing' ‘I think the Silent Weekend was an excellent idea and not . before time.’ Mr Yates came up with the idea after he watched an under-nines match last year and saw how terrified one boy was. He . said: ‘He was absolutely petrified by the experience. All the adults . were shouting and baying and it was an intimidating and hostile . environment. 'Afterwards his father came over and . said: ""This is not right. Something has to change."" ‘I agreed with . him and immediately set about thinking how we could make the environment . less hostile for people just learning the sport.' Coaches also had to be quiet, although there were concerns about how they would instruct players as a result. It is now hoped that other FA bodies could take up the idea. But it wasn’t only the crowd that was asked to remain quiet during Silent Weekend, even the coaches had to button their lips. Mr Yates said: ‘There was some opposition to that and after the matches there were some concerns that coaches weren’t able to coach the players and there were some parents who were frustrated by not being able to offer their encouragement. ‘But the aim of the weekend was to show how junior football matches can be marred by the type of hostility and intimidation that have become a norm.’","Silent Weekend was planned by Lancashire Football Association .

"By . Jaya Narain . Jurors have been warned an inquest into the tragic deaths of 96 football fans at Hillsborough in 1989 could take up to a year. The families of the fans killed in Britain's worst ever sporting disaster were yesterday bracing themselves for a long and emotional hearing. Relatives pressed for fresh inquests after controversial verdicts of accidental death were recorded following the original inquests 23 years ago. Liverpool fans are pulled to safety from the crush at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield that killed 96. Jurors have been warned an inquest into the tragic deaths could take up to a year . After a long and hard campaign by two separate groups the original verdicts were eventually quashed in 2012 and new inquests ordered. Jenni Hicks lost her two teenage daughter, Victoria, 15 and Sarah, 19, when thousands of fans were crushed during Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest in the Sheffield stadium. Now vice-chairwoman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group she said lots of tears had been shed in the run-up to the inquests which are being held in Warrington, Cheshire. But she said the families were ready for the hearing to begin adding: 'It's been a long time coming. I've had an emotional weekend.' Charlotte Hennessy, who lost her father James Robert Hennessy in the disaster when she was six years old, said: 'It's finally here. 'I don't know if excited is the right word to use, but finally we're here and it's going to happen. I'm really, really nervous. It's been a long, long fight. Thirteen retired or serving police officers have been identified as 'suspects' over the tragedy . A police officer gives first aid to a fan pulled from the crush. (There is no suggestion this officer is a suspect) 'Hopefully, this is the beginning of . the end. I was a bit of an emotional wreck this weekend, I've not slept a . wink. But this is the beginning now, hopefully it can be put right.' The . original inquests in Sheffield were the longest running in British . legal history and concluded on March 1991 when the jury returned a . verdict of accidental death. In December 2012, the then Lord Chief Justice, Lord Igor Judge, on the instruction of Attorney General Dominic Grieve, quashed those verdicts at the Royal Courts of Justice in London and ordered new inquests to take place. The coroner Lord Justice Goldring opened the inquest and spent the day carrying out the selection of jurors who would be able to sit for a year. Potential jurors were brought into the modern, purpose-built courtroom on the outskirts of Warrington and assessed for their suitability. A pool of 150 potential jurors had already filled in questionnaires and were also asked whether they supported Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham Forest or Liverpool. Potential jurors were also excused if they had links to the ambulance or the police service though a lighter note was sounded when laughter broke out as one declared they were an Everton fan. Among the matters the inquests will consider will be South Yorkshire Police's preparations for the match, the management of the crowd on the day of the disaster, the response by the emergency services and individual experiences of the 96 victims, including medical evidence relating to how they died. Dozens of lawyers have been drafted in to represent not just the families of the victims but also police forces, retired police officers, ambulance crews and hospitals. The inquests will run concurrently to the two criminal investigations that are going on: Operation Resolve which looks at events leading up to April 1989 and the disaster itself, and the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) inquiry which is examining police activity after the disaster, including any allegations of a cover-up. There will be opening statements from the coroner and the families this week, with background 'pen portraits' of each person who died in the disaster. Later jurors will make a site visit to Sheffield's Hillsborough stadium but will be directed not to read the 'deeply moving' tributes on the memorial to the tragedy.","Victims' families braced for a .

"By . Jaya Narain . Fearing its latest round of bonuses would create negative headlines and trigger a backlash, Barclays decided to act. But rather than rein in fat-cat remuneration, it came up with a novel way to head off public anger – turn off televisions in branches so customers couldn’t watch the news. Earlier his week Barclays announced that 500 super-rich bankers pocketed at least £1million each last year. Barclays Bank, Bletchley. One of the many branches that will have been told to turn TVs off so that customers don't see the news about the head of their bank getting a £950,000 share remuneration (which some are calling disguised bonuses) Concerned about ‘negative coverage’ it urged staff in its high-street branches to turn over from news channels and, in a last resort, to unplug the screens. Last night bank bosses denied they had made a direct instruction to change the channels but spoke of their regret over the memo in which the ploy was outlined. The memo read: ‘It’s likely there will be some media interest. 'We’d like to give you the heads up so you can change the channel in your branch to support colleagues in the event there is negative coverage. Barclays customers have been complaining about the revelations, with some saying they were 'stunned and outraged' It recommended a couple of channels, adding ‘as a last resort find the power source and turn off the TV’. Yesterday customers at Barclays said they were ‘stunned and outraged’ by the directive and accused the bank of trying to mask a fat cat culture. Customer Gemma Jones, 24, of Manchester said: ‘It’s shocking that they would issue a memo which set out to deceive their own customers.’ Another customer said: ‘It’s astonishing. Many people who bank with Barclays will be outraged. It is absolutely stunning really. 'They have obviously learnt that customers find these bonuses unacceptable so their solution it – keep it from the customers. What a joke.’ Barclays’ annual report, released this week, also revealed that chief executive Antony Jenkins will be paid £950,000 in share allowances on top of his normal salary and bonuses – taking his potential remuneration to £6.3million. Mr Jenkins said the controversial decision to increase bonuses by £200m in 2013 despite profits falling had to be made or the investment division would suffer. Last night a spokesman for Barclays said: ‘The TV screens in our branches are tuned to one channel, typically news. Some branch staff asked whether they could change the channel if they felt the programme unsuitable. ‘We encourage our staff to use their discretion and confirmed that they could do so. We did not direct colleagues to change the TV channel.’","Barclays bosses have been worried about backlash following bonus news .

"By . Jaya Narain . A career criminal sobbed in the dock yesterday as he was jailed for the brutal murder of a war veteran in his own bed. Daniel Crompton, 24, broke into the home of widower Frank Worsley, 87, and demanded to know where he kept his money. When the terrified pensioner said he didn’t have any cash, Crompton took off his T-shirt, wrapped it around his fist and beat him  savagely around the head. Terror: Daniel Crompton, left, has been sentenced to life in prison over the killing of Frank Worsley, right . Mr Worsley was left badly injured  and told police he was ‘shocked and frightened’ by the ferocity of the attack. Later . that day the veteran, who served with the Royal Navy Medical Corps, . suffered a bleed on the brain and was taken to hospital where he later . died. Yesterday Crompton, a . drug user who had clocked up 42 previous convictions since the age of . 14, was jailed for 18 years at Manchester Crown Court. Passing . sentence, Mr Justice Turner told him: ‘You neither knew nor cared . whether the house was occupied. All you cared about was your craving for . further cocaine. Couple: Mr Worsley spent 25 years nursing his wife Mary through her battle with multiple sclerosis . ‘The attack was as brutal as it was cowardly. ‘When . Mr Worsley was on his way to hospital, you were busily spending his . money.’ The jury heard Mr Worsley, a grandfather and father of two, had . lived alone since the death of his wife, Mary, in 2012. On August 3 last year he awoke to the terrifying sight of Crompton standing over him and demanding he hand over money. The court was told the drug-addicted father of one had needed money to buy cocaine and pay off debts from payday loans. He . had been to a party, drunk lager and snorted cocaine and was said to be . ‘wired and excited’ when he left to carry out the raid on the . vulnerable elderly man. Home: Crompton broke in to Mr Worsley terraced house in Bolton and stole £85 to buy cocaine . Even . after being beaten Mr Worsley bravely refused to comply with Crompton’s . demands, so the intruder snatched a wallet and chequebook and fled – . leaving his palm print on a window frame. Jurors . looked visibly shocked as Mr Worsley’s frantic 999 call was played to . the court, in which he begged the operator: ‘Help me please. ‘He’s . hit me and beaten me and attacked me and taken my wallet.’ Later in . hospital, medical staff decided against surgery for the bleed on his . brain because he had been taking the anticoagulant drug warfarin for a . heart complaint and operating would have been too dangerous. Beloved: Mr Worsley's family paid tribute to him after his murderer was sentenced to life in prison . He . was taken off the drug in the hope it would help but he suffered a . stroke on August 7 and died on August 20. The jury heard Mr Worsley was a . former Sunday school teacher and amateur operatics enthusiast. After . leaving the Navy he worked in several jobs before taking retirement so . he could care full-time for his wife, Mary, who suffered from multiple . sclerosis. They were . married for 62 years and he nursed her for 25 years until her death in . September 2012. He had fitted extra locks at their Bolton terraced house . after a previous burglary in 2010. Crompton . claimed the pensioner had been injured during a tussle between the pair . but a jury took six hours to find him guilty of murder by a majority . verdict of 10-2. He sobbed . in the dock when the verdict was returned and shouted, ‘I hope you’re . pleased with yourselves’ at the jury as he was  led away. His girlfriend Beverley Hardman, 25, of Bolton, is accused of helping Crompton evade police and faces a trial in May. Mr . Worsley’s family said in a statement: ‘We could be more accepting of . his death if it had been of old age, peaceful and dignified. Instead it . wasn’t peaceful, he wasn’t comfortable, he was scared, agitated and . distressed as a result of this callous attack.’","Daniel Crompton beat Frank Worsley as he burgled his house in Bolton .

"By . Andy Dolan . Obese: A couple from King's Lynn, Norfolk, have been arrested for allowing their 11 year-old son's weight to balloon to 15 stone (file picture) A couple have been arrested on suspicion of neglect and child cruelty after their 11-year-old son’s weight ballooned to 15st. Police stepped in after doctors raised concerns about the boy’s welfare following two visits to hospital earlier this year. Yesterday the parents admitted they called their obese son ‘Wee Chubby’ because of his size – but blamed genetics rather than his diet and lifestyle. Following a meeting with social workers this week, the couple have agreed to a letter of intent over the boy’s care outlining what they will do to help him lose weight. If they fail to stick to the terms, legal proceedings will be started to take the boy into care. The 5ft 1in schoolboy has a body mass index of 41.8 – close to double the healthy level. According to the NHS’s online BMI calculator, the healthy weight range for his age and height is from 6st 14lb to 9st 7lb. A social services report is said to record that he fell over during a school swimming session and was unable to stand up by himself. It also details admissions to teachers that the boy – who is supposed to be on a strict diet – had eaten takeaways and been to a milkshake parlour. The boy’s 20st father said yesterday: ‘My son’s always been big. He was born with shovels for hands and spades for feet. Everyone on my side of the family is big. ‘There’s nothing we can do about it. I only eat occasional kebabs. Our son’s favourite snack is steamed broccoli – and he’s still big.’ The father, 49, and his unemployed wife, 43, told The Sun they try to encourage their son to play sport by giving him toy guns to fire in their garden at home. He also plays regularly on his Nintendo Wii, a computer games console in which players depend on physical movements to control actions on the screen. The couple had signed up to a voluntary plan to tackle the boy’s weight when they were threatened with legal action earlier this year, but it brought no improvement. Concerns were raised by teachers at the specialist school he attends for help with autism, and the parents agreed to see a social worker. The 5ft 1in schoolboy has a body mass index of 41.8 - close to double the healthy level. According to the NHS's online BMI calculator, the healthy weight range for his age and height is between 6st 14lb and 9st 7lbs (file . pic) But doctors at the boy’s local hospital called police after he was twice admitted for treatment in March, and officers then visited the family’s home. The parents were asked to attend a police station voluntarily and were interviewed separately on suspicion of neglect and child cruelty. Both were released on bail. The boy’s mother, who describes herself as ‘chubby’, said the family were trying their best to help him. ‘The idea they could take away my son scares me so much,’ she said. ‘I’m nothing without my kids. His weight isn’t that much of a big deal … it’s genetics – you can be genetically fat.’ Police said it would be ‘inappropriate’ to comment on the case, but added that a child’s welfare was ‘paramount’ in such situations and that officers only intervened when ‘other attempts to protect the child have been unsuccessful’. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Parents, from King's Lynn, Norfolk, arrested for allowing son to reach 15st .

"By . Jaya Narain . Anti-fracking protesters could be forcibly removed from their camp by bailiffs today after a court ruled against them. After a two-day hearing the landowners were granted a possession order for the land where an energy firm is carrying out drilling. IGas was granted permission for exploratory gas drilling at the site and said it is seeking methane and shale gas but has no immediate plans for fracking. Police officers work to remove protesters who chained themselves to a coffin at the entrance of IGas exploratory drilling site at Barton Moss, where landowners can now evict demonstrators . But scores of anti-fracking protesters descended on Barton Moss, near Salford last November, erecting a large camp of around 60 tents and caravans along the farm track. In the past four months more than 80 protesters have been arrested and charged with a variety of offences including obstruction and drink-driving. The protest is estimated to have cost £750,000 so far with Greater Manchester Police having to prioritise more and more officers to the site. Landowners Peel Investments North Ltd served notice to the protesters last month saying they were going to the High Court in Manchester in a bid to have them removed for trespass. They were granted the order yesterday though the judge allowed protesters leave to appeal which will be heard today at noon, after which protesters could be evicted if the appeal fails. But the Mail understands protesters will simply move from the farm track onto nearby agricultural land and continue their opposition. Martin Porter, of Frack Free Greater Manchester, said: ‘It may be the camp moves somewhere else, perhaps down the road. I think some people have already moved to some woods nearby. Amid numerous stunts and protests in four months, 80 protesters have been arrested and charged with offences . The protesters can now appeal. If that fails, they will be evicted from the Salford site . ‘This event was about stopping fracking around the country as a whole. We are disappointed with the decision. If we lose the appeal we will clear the site but the protest will continue.’ Fracking involves the fracturing of rock with a pressurised liquid to release shale gas, with potentially vast reserves untapped across swathes of the UK. The Government and industry chiefs say fracking is a safe, cheap way of harvesting fuel and more environmentally friendly than oil exploration. But campaigners say there is clear evidence that fracking causes serious air and water pollution and leads to earth tremors. Protesters at the Barton Moss site, which lies in the shadow of the M62, have accused the police officers of violence and bully-boy tactics. But police accused protesters themselves . of resorting to dirty tactics after a police officer was injured by a . ‘booby-trap’ drum containing barbed wire and glass. The protests outside Cuadrilla in West Sussex last year cost the police force more than £3million . He suffered a cut to his hand last month as he attempted to free two anti-fracking protesters who locked themselves to the concrete drum. Peel Investments claimed the continued presence of scores of protesters would lead to ‘escalating problems’ at the site. But the protesters argued any possession order would represent a ‘disproportionate interference’ with their right to protest under Article 10 and 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights. However their claims were rejected by Judge Mark Pelling QC who said that permitting the protesters to occupy the site would be a breach of domestic law, because they did not have consent to remain there. Campaigners had also sought to establish that the camp - which runs along a grass verge next to a road - was located on land leased by Peel to a farmer, making any possession order useless, and that they had a right to protest on the road because it’s also a public footpath. But the judge said the verge did not form part of the lease because it had ‘no agricultural purpose’ and added the protests - which had seen protesters sat down or lying down in the road to stop traffic reaching site - exceeded ‘permissible highway use and as result constitutes a trespass against the owner of the land over which the right runs.’ Martin Burke, one of the defendants in the case, said: ‘This case is a success in the campaign to highlight the fact that fracking is highly dangerous.’ Around 1,000 anti-fracking campaigners marched peacefully through Manchester city centre at the weekend to protest against the controversial drilling at Barton Moss. IGas is due to complete its drilling by the end of this month. Large scale anti-fracking protests in Balcombe, West Sussex last summer went on for weeks and cost the police force more than £3m. More than 80 people, opposed to Cuadrilla Resources’ exploratory oil drilling operation, were arrested in angry confrontations at the site. In January Cuadrilla said it was to scrap plans to use fracking near the village because rock already contained natural fractures.","Landowners given possession order for drilling sites after two-day hearing .

"By . Hugo Gye . and Jaya Narain . Anger: Nazier Din was given a police caution even though he was the victim of a crime carried out by a vandal on his business . A . businessman whose office was vandalised was arrested and hauled through . the courts after he put up a poster branding the prime suspect a ‘dirty . pervert drug dealing grass’. Nazier Din, 44, was infuriated when police told him no one would be prosecuted for smashing his office window with a brick. The name of the suspected culprit was handed to police but they said they could not press charges because of a lack of evidence. So . company director Mr Din put a large sign over the boarded-up window, . which expressed his view of the suspect without naming him. He . was astonished when police said the suspect had complained  about the . sign and warned him he could face arrest for public order offences for . causing ‘distress and alarm’. So then he taped over the word ‘pervert’ and added a disclaimer apologising for any distress to  the public. But . police were not satisfied and Mr Din was arrested and later charged . with using threatening, abusive or insulting words – behaviour likely to . cause harassment, alarm and distress. The . father of two then faced two months of legal wrangling over the case in . the courts  – and a £1,000 legal bill – before finally agreeing to  a . police caution. Last . night Mr Din, from Bury, Greater Manchester, who has run a successful . accident management and car hire firm for 12 years, condemned police and . courts for failing to side with victims of crime. He said he was appalled that the vandal, who caused £2,500 worth of damage, will face no punishment. And . he claimed he put up the sign only after he had been repeatedly goaded . by the individual he suspected of committing the crime in the first . place. He said: ‘I was treated like a common criminal and yet I was supposed to be the victim of crime. ‘Why did I have to go through the courts for two months? There was no name on the sign, so how could it cause any distress? ‘One complaint was made about the sign by a named person and two were anonymous. 'The . first complaint made was by the man who I believe broke the window.  My . solicitor asked the police why he wasn’t arrested when he made his . complaint yet they said they couldn’t prove anything as he had made no . admissions. ‘What I can’t understand is why anyone would be angry about that sign unless they knew it was referring to them. 'Offensive': The person suspected of vandalising Mr Din's office subsequently complained to police after he put up this sign over the broken window . ‘I never intended to offend anyone – if anything this was a joke at the expense of the vandal, and he wasn’t even named. ‘But I was arrested at my home in front of my wife by three detectives. It seems totally over the top.’ He . added: ‘First and foremost, I would like to apologise if we caused any . offence – because it was never our intention to do this. 'We wanted people to know that I was a victim of a crime and that the office had not shut down. ‘We are hard-working people and I wouldn’t wish this on anybody. ‘What I really want is for the vandal to be arrested for the criminal damage. I just want justice to be done.’ A . spokesman for the Crown  Prosecution Service said that the evidence was . thoroughly reviewed by a senior prosecutor and discussed with Greater . Manchester Police before Mr Din was handed  a caution.","Nazier Din, 44, had his office in Greater Manchester targeted by a vandal .

"By . Tim Finan . and Andy Dolan . Adrian Harvey, 43, IT Director of Common Nonsense, took pictures of . children holidaying at a French naturist resort using a mini spy camera . hidden in a car key fob . A British company director took pictures of children holidaying at a French naturist resort, using a mini spy camera hidden in a car key fob. Adrian Harvey, 43, sneaked up on the children and teenagers after driving alone to the beachside complex, dubbed Naked City, a French court heard yesterday. The married father-of-four had bought the gadget days before he arrived at the Village Naturiste, a self-contained resort which attracts up to 40,000 visitors each day, at Cap d’Agde on the Mediterranean coast. He was spotted pointing the key fob at groups of youngsters on the resort’s beach, where nudism is obligatory. Gendarmes were summoned and discovered the fob housed a hidden camera which contained images of naked or nearly nude children, aged from six to 18. Harvey told the court, in the medieval town of Beziers, that he travelled to the resort after taking a few days off from the IT business he runs with wife Kate from their bungalow in Inkberrow, Worcestershire, because the pair were going through marital difficulties. He checked into a hotel near Cap d’Agde and said he had chosen the nudist beach because of its beauty. Asked why he had not visited beaches in Britain, Harvey replied that they were too cold. The presiding judge suggested Harvey may have been attracted to Naked City because of its reputation for voyeurism and exhibitionism. Cameras and the taking of recorded images are banned, but the court heard there have been numerous cases of paedophiles caught filming youngsters naked at the site. During the past ten years there have been clashes between people describing themselves as pure naturists and voyeurs and exhibitionists who engage in sex acts on the beach. Nightclubs at Cap d’Agde regularly feature group sex parties. Harvey claimed he only took the images out of ‘curiosity’ and told the court he planned to delete them, adding that he was ashamed of his behaviour. The married father-of-four bought the gadget before he arrived . at the Village Naturiste, a self-contained resort at Cap d'Agde on the . Mediterranean coast, pictured . Harvey, who has no previous convictions, admitted possessing pornographic images of minors and was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment, suspended for five years. He told the panel of three female judges: ‘I fully understand the gravity of the situation. I am deeply ashamed. It will not happen again.’ Asked why he took the mini camera to Cap d’Agde he said, through an interpreter, that he ‘liked model aeroplanes and he intended to use it to film them’. ‘I thought it would be less intrusive than a normal camera’, Harvey added. When the judge suggested he had brought the camera with him to film naked children, Harvey did not reply but hung his head in the dock. Mrs Harvey, listed as company secretary of her husband’s firm – Common Nonsense – last night claimed not to know about her husband’s court appearance.

"By . Richard Spillett . and Andy Dolan . After a flirtation with TV stardom, White Dee’s subsequent fame has been based more on her apparently comfortable lifestyle while still claiming state handouts. But now the party could be over for the woman who became a national celebrity after appearing on the Channel 4 show Benefits Street. Her agent Barry Tomes is due to meet officials from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) today to discuss the single mother’s situation. Warning: White Dee with her agent Barry Tomes in Birmingham yesterday ahead of his meeting with the DWP . However, all is not lost for the star of James Turner street, as it emerged she has set her sights on a career as a model by becoming the face of a 'plus-size' clothing range. On the eve . of crunch talks between her agent and benefits chiefs to find out if . her handouts will be cut, the reality TV star is already making plans . for a new source of income. She's . hoping to find work promoting a plus size clothing brand as she looks . for ways to cash in on her famous face and turn her hand to advertising. Mr Tomes said: 'I'd like to get Dee introducing . clothes for larger size women, or promoting supermarkets, I mean she's a . mum, she's had to learn to shop on a budget.' White Dee - pictured at Birmingham Pride this weekend - could be set for a career in modelling . Yesterday, . Mr Tomes denied reports that his client, whose real name is Deirdre . Kelly, has already had her benefits cut, but added: ‘They [the DWP] . might be able to tell us they are stopping her money while she is . earning. They could then  restart if Dee cannot work. ‘I . have informed the DWP of whatever she has earned. It could be that she . has a letter on its way warning that some benefits are going to be . stopped. I hope the DWP can provide clarity at this meeting.’ After . taking part in the controversial documentary about one of Britain’s . most benefit-dependent streets, James Turner Street in Birmingham, Miss . Kelly has been revelling in the perks of her newfound celebrity. There . have been lucrative tabloid newspaper interviews, promotional . appearances at events, meals at four-star hotels and even a free trip to . Majorca, where she was pictured posing with a £500 bottle of Moet and . downing shots and pints. The 42-year-old angered taxpayers after insisting she would continue claiming until the Government stops her. Dee has amassed a big fan base since appearing in Benefits Street and her agent has said she could quickly become a millionaire once she is well enough to work . She appeared at Birmingham Pride this weekend, where fans flocked to have photos taken with her . Modelling is just the latest in a string of possible careers she's . lined up, despite insisting she's currently too depressed to work. However, . Rivkie Baum, editor of Slink Magazine, a fashion and lifestyle . publication for women with curves, said: 'While I admire Dee's tenacity . and thought she actually came across well on the show, playing her . motherly role to the street, I think trying to make it as a plus size . model or fashion voice may just be a step too far. 'In . order to be the face of a brand one would expect the chosen face to . either be aspirational or at least have a great sense of style. 'Even . though Dee has had to learn to shop on a budget and would be easily . relatable to for a number of women, she doesn't quite embody the dream . that the world of fashion, both high-street and high end try to sell.' A public campaign was launched to get Dee - pictured after returning home from a recent trip to Magaluf (left) and receiving a gift from a fan (right) - wearing a bra after she appeared unsupported in Benefits Street . Nevertheless, Mr Tomes . insists that, even though Dee is not currently bringing in money, he . sees his work as an investment in his client.  He has been quoted as . saying  she will become 'a millionaire' soon after she's well enough to . take paid work. He was given an insight into his client's apparent popularity when she appeared at the Birmingham Pride event this weekend. Fans . cheered her arrival and flocked around for photographs and autographs . as she was treated like a VIP at the West Midlands festival. The . row over whether she should still be on handouts exploded last month . when she was spotted downing pints and drinking shots on a 'Carnage . Magaluf' bar crawl. After . she insisted the trip was purely a way of getting her well enough to . work, Labour MP Simon Danczuk slammed her as a 'poster girl' for people . who want to 'get famous for doing nothing'. Dee sparked anger last month when she was pictured downing shots on a Magaluf bar crawl while continuing to claim handouts in the UK . The . DWP meeting comes a week after David Cameron warned that the mother of . two could lose her benefits if she is found to be earning a lot of money . from her promotional work. She . receives £214 a week from a combination of employment and support . allowance – formerly known as incapacity benefit – child tax credit and . child benefit, plus £500 a month housing benefit. Mr . Tomes met his client in a pub beer garden last Friday to discuss the . DWP meeting. He said the DWP had asked for it to take place at a secret . location to avoid a ‘media scrum’. He . said officials are meeting him rather than Miss Kelly because . technically he is her employer. ‘Any work Dee does that involves payment . sees the money go to me,’ Mr Tomes said. ‘I then pay the client.’ Miss . Kelly claims her depression has stopped her from working full-time . since she was sacked from her job with Birmingham City Council in 2007, . after she was convicted of stealing £13,000. The . DWP said it does not comment on individual cases but added that if a . claimant is being paid for work in kind it can stop payments.","The reality TV star is hoping to land a contract with a clothing label .

"By . Andy Dolan . A militant RSPCA campaigner caused controversy when she likened the plight of livestock to that of the Jews in the Holocaust (library image) The RSPCA has been plunged into fresh controversy after a militant campaigner seeking election to its ruling council likened the plight of livestock to that of Jews in the Holocaust. Peta Watson-Smith, 61, is one of six candidates fighting to fill five vacancies on the charity’s council, which contributes to its ‘effective leadership and direction’. The vote is pivotal for the RSPCA’s future because the council intends to appoint a new chief executive early next year to replace the combative Gavin Grant, who resigned because of poor health. His tenure saw the charity at war with farms and hunters, while the number of prosecutions it launched almost doubled – leading to accusations the charity was overzealous and politically and financially motivated. Mrs Watson-Smith said eating less meat and dairy produce would benefit animals and be better for people’s health, welfare and psychology. She told The Times: ‘I don’t think people always appreciate what is the holocaust going on behind closed doors. You talk about the Jews. This probably sounds like animal rights, but if you recognise animals as sentient beings, why are we treating them so abysmally on farms?’ The comments drew condemnation from countryside campaigners and Jewish groups, who branded the comparison ‘offensive’ and accused her of ‘trivialising’ the suffering of millions. Mrs Watson-Smith, who lives in Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, has already urged the RSPCA to drop Freedom Food, the accreditation programme promoting higher farm welfare standards which is backed by the chef Jamie Oliver. She says the money should be spent on prosecuting farmers and, if elected, she would like the RSPCA to encourage the public to ‘follow a wholly plant-based diet’. She supports Hillside, a sanctuary for animals ‘rescued from the farming industry’ and wants to ban the Grand National. Alan Aziz, director of the Zionist Federation, said: ‘No one who fully understands the all-encompassing evil of the Holocaust, and its systematic programme of genocide, could ever seriously compare it to the treatment – no matter how bad – of farm animals. ‘While everyone is entitled to their own views about the morality and efficiency of how we source our food, that can never be an acceptable reason to trivialise the memory of the millions of Jews and others who were deliberately exterminated by the Nazi regime.’ Tim Bonner, of the Countryside Alliance, added: ‘This is the language of extremists which would be offensive to anyone who isn’t obsessed with an animal rights agenda – particularly those who lived and suffered through the Holocaust. In her controversial rant, Peta Watson-Smith, 61, also said eating less meat and dairy produce would benefit animals and be better for people¿s health, welfare and psychology . 'A creeping political and animal rights agenda has been apparent in the RSPCA for a number of years now and further moves towards militancy are not going to improve its image to the public.’ Another candidate, Joseph Piccioni, also supports Hillside and was nominated by Mrs Watson-Smith. Mr Piccioni helped to persuade the charity to withdraw from Crufts because of concerns about pedigree dog breeding. One candidate seen as a moderate voice is Christopher Laurence, the charity’s former chief vet and an adviser on dog-breeding legislation aimed at reducing the number of irresponsibly bred puppies. Asked about the effect of electing Mrs Watson-Smith and Mr Piccioni, Mr Laurence said: ‘Every time there is an election, we change the balance of the council. If those two were elected and I was not, that clearly would make a difference.’ Polling results for the unpaid positions are due to be announced at a charity meeting this month. In December, the RSPCA hired a lawyer to carry out a £50,000 review of its controversial prosecutions policy following months of criticism, including its decision to bring a £330,000 private prosecution against the Heythrop Hunt in David Cameron’s Oxfordshire constituency.","Peta Watson, 61, one of six candidates fighting for spot on charity's council .

"By . Andy Dolan . The brother of a British teacher found murdered in Bali said that she had only been in the country for five days before she died. Anne-Marie Drozdz, 49, was discovered dead on the floor of her holiday apartment on Friday with a black cloth over her face. Police believe that she may have been strangled after returning to the property and disturbing an intruder. Anne Marie Drozdz, a spinster, who was originally from Hinckley, Leicestershire, had spent much of the last 20 years teaching around the world as well as travelling . The spinster, who was originally from Hinckley, Leicestershire, had spent much of the last 20 years teaching around the world as well as travelling, her brother Gregory said yesterday. Mr Drozdz, 55, a delivery driver who lives with wife Margaret in the Leicestershire town, said: ‘Ever since Anne-Marie qualified as a teacher he plan was to travel and work abroad. She started in Namibia, then Columbia and Turkey and for the last five years had been teaching in Vietnam. She loved the Far East and was very knowledgeable on it. ‘We only found out she had moved to Bali when the Foreign Office called us with the dreadful news on Friday evening. I hadn’t seen Anne-Marie since our father’s funeral in 2008, but we kept in touch via email. 'We believe she planned to set up a social enterprise, helping young people to express themselves through music and drama. She had taken a year out from teaching – she had obviously found a project that she believed in.’ The villa where  Anne Marie Drozdz was found dead - she had only been in the country five days . Mr Drozdz and brother Peter, 54, were yesterday waiting for further information on the progress of the Indonesian police investigation. Police have said the door to Miss Drozdz’s flat had been forced and there were ‘dried-up pools of blood on the floor’ when she was discovered by the husband of her landlady.  A local builder has been arrested. Mr Drozdz added: ‘We are still trying to come to terms with our grief but I will be contacting the Foreign Office early next week in order to start to talk through the practicalities [about bringing the body of Miss Drozdz home]. ‘The family just want the authorities over there to vigorously investigate what has happened, and how our sister met her terrible fate.’","Anne-Marie Drozdz, 49, was discovered dead on the floor of her holiday apartment on Friday with a black cloth over her face .

"By . Andy Dolan . A bus company has axed a busy route after it fell victim to ‘crash for cash’ fraudsters 15 times in two years. Central Buses said the final straw came when it received 15 insurance claims from people saying they were passengers hurt in a collision that actually involved just four people – none of whom was injured. A motorist travelling alone braked sharply in front of a single-decker bus carrying two passengers. Geoff Cross, managing director of Central Buses, said the company had been forced to axe the 98 route from Small Heath to Ward End in Birmingham because of the so-called cash for crash scam . Despite repairs to the bus and car costing only £500 each, the firm ended up paying out £25,000 to avoid the costs of fighting each case in court. Yesterday the company said it had to withdraw the 98 service from Small Heath to Ward End, in Birmingham, to avoid any more fraudulent claims. The city has become a crash for cash hotspot, with six of its postcodes among the ten UK districts where the crime is most likely. The scam involves criminals staging crashes between vehicles in order to make claims against motorists for injuries such as whiplash and for damage to vehicles. Geoff Cross, managing director of Central Buses, said anyone wanting to claim should be forced to pay a £50 bond before any legal action, to make fraudsters think twice about lodging bogus claims. ‘We’ve known for a long time about this phenomenon – to our bitter cost,’ he said. Charity Crimestoppers named Birmingham as a crash for cash capital, along with Bradford, based on insurance data . ‘The most serious incident happened in Alum Rock when our driver noticed a car being driven erratically. 'It cut him up and braked sharply. Our driver braked too, but was unable to avoid a collision. 'There was only the driver in the car and two passengers on our bus but we ended up with 15 claimants all claiming they had been injured.’ It is thought associates of the fraudsters were encouraged to lodge claims for compensation over the ‘accident’ – taking the total to 15. Mr Cross said: ‘Insurance companies are often reluctant to fight the claims, even if they do think they are bogus. 'If we were to go to court the costs would be astronomical … At present [claimants] have nothing to lose by going with a no-win-no-fee lawyer.’ The firm now runs 17 services, all fitted with CCTV cameras to deter fraudsters. Mr Cross added: ‘If we hadn’t installed CCTV we probably wouldn’t be in business now because of the fraudulent claims.’ In December, the charity Crimestoppers named Birmingham and Bradford as crash for cash capitals, based on insurance data. The cities host nine of the ten districts where the crime is most likely. The final area is in Bolton. The Insurance Fraud Bureau estimates the annual cost of crash for cash scams is £392million.","Central Buses axed route between Small Heath and Ward End, Birmingham .

"By . Andy Dolan . Abbi Kinsella, 54, dressed in her witch costume, before she stole tens of thousands from her mother . For a woman convicted of swindling her own elderly mother out her £100,000 life savings, it is a somewhat appropriate outfit. Posing as a wicked witch, Abbi Kinsella is pictured ahead of a fancy dress party in the snap uploaded to Facebook two years ago. Kinsella now faces jail after a jury took just 20 minutes to convict her of stealing the cash from her 88-year-old mother, Margaret Bowyer, who suffers from dementia. The court heard the pensioner ended up ‘on the street and penniless’ after Kinsella, 54, used £34,000 of the money to feed her online bingo habit and had also holidayed in the exclusive resort of St Tropez in the South of France. Kinsella, whose home has a sign outside featuring a black plastic crow above the warning: ‘Beware of the witch’, also used £200 of her mother’s money on a Sky TV subscription, the court heard. Prosecutor Andrew Wallace said Mrs Bowyer moved in to a rented home next door to her duplicitous daughter in Tamworth Staffordshire, after selling her own property in Swadlincote, Derbyshire, and banking the money from the sale. But over the next three years, more than £61,000 was transferred from Mrs Bowyer’s bank account to Kinsella’s, and in addition there were 244 cash withdrawals totalling more than £38,000. After plundering the account, Kinsella cancelled her mother’s rent and direct debit payments in April 2011. As a result, the pensioner, who was too ill to give evidence, was eventually evicted from her rented home in November 2012, Stafford Crown Court was told. The home (centre with car on drive) of Kinsella in Fazeley, near Tamworth, Staffordshire . Mr Wallace said Kinsella had ‘totally abused her position as Mrs Bowyer’s daughter...thrown her mother out on the street, penniless, and then lied about it. ‘She has taken advantage of an old lady. While she was supposed to be looking after her mother...she’s been funding her bingo habit. She has fleeced her mother.’ Social services referred Mrs Bowyer’s case to the police in November 2012 and her daughter was arrested a month later. When questioned, Kinsella said she had stopped rent payments going out of the account in April 2011 because the owner of the property owed them some money for ‘doing the back garden’. The somewhat appropriate sign nailed to the house of Abbi Kinsella, who caused her mother to be evicted due to continued theft . She said she had restarted rent payments in cash, but hadn’t got any receipts for it. Kinsella, a one-time Avon lady now said by neighbours to work at Birmingham Airport, claimed she had given the money transferred back to Mrs Bowyer ‘in cash’. She denied using the money for her own gain, but when asked if she knew what her mother had done with £212 a week, Kinsella said ‘No’. The prosecutor at Kinsella's trial argued how she had 'abused' her position and had 'thrown her mother out on the street' Kinsella denied four charges of theft from her mother, who was too ill to give evidence, but admitted one offence of fraud. Following the jury’s verdict on Monday, Judge Mark Eades told her: ‘I don’t want you to be under any illusions, you should prepare yourself for a custodial sentence.’ Kinsella was remanded on bail and will be sentenced after a pre-sentence report has been prepared. Detective Constable Mark Woodings, the officer who carried out the investigation for Staffordshire Police, said: ‘The victim is an extremely vulnerable elderly lady. ‘When she became unable to manage her own financial affairs due to the onset of dementia, the family entrusted Kinsella to look after her interests and welfare. ‘Kinsella went on to abuse that trust in a most heartless and callous way, stealing every penny of her mother’s life savings. ‘She systematically and repeatedly helped herself to more than £100,000 in order to feed a gambling habit and to live a life beyond her means. ‘Her actions have left a proud lady homeless, penniless and in debt for the first time in her life.’ Mrs Bowyer is now thought to be living in a care home in Tamworth.’ There was no sign of divorced Kinsella at the modern three-bedroom terrace she shares with partner John Causer, 53, a building worker, in Tamworth. Neighbours said the couple regularly held fancy dress parties and said Kinsella had been known to dress up as a witch. It is an image she appears to revel in -a sign outside her house features a black plastic crow above the warning: ‘Beware of the witch’.","Abbi Kinsella, 54 has been convicted for stealing £100,000 from her mother .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . and Andy Dolan . A mentally-ill man is suspected of killing his parents at their family home after he stopped taking his medication, neighbours said last night. The bodies of Leszek Dantes, and his wife Malgorzata, both 54, were discovered early yesterday at their semi-detached home. Police said a 28-year-old man, identified by neighbours as their son Kamil, said to be schizophrenic, had been detained and was being treated in hospital. Leszek Dantes and his wife Malgorzata Dantes who were found dead at their home in Worksop, Nottinghamshire today. A man, believed to be their son, has been detained by police . Shocked neighbours told how a man was led out of the family home in handcuffs and a white forensics suit after emergency services descended on the street at around 7am. Officers said the tragedy was an 'isolated incident' - but patrols would be carried out in the area to reassure worried locals. Post-mortem examinations on Mr and Mrs Dantes, originally from Poland and thought to be in their late 50s, are due to be carried out on Tuesday. It is understood he had slashed his wrists after knifing his parents at the house in Worksop, Nottinghamshire. A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police said detectives were 'working to establish the circumstances surrounding their deaths' - the causes of which have not yet been revealed. Neighbours said the 'quiet' family had lived in the house, which was cordoned off while an investigation was carried out, for around eight months. They told how the man and his mother both worked shifts in local factories and made sure someone was always at home to care for Mr Dantes. Leszek Dantes, whose body was found at the semi-detached property. Post-mortem examinations on the couple are expected tomorrow . Faye Peacock, 64, said: 'They were a nice family. Leszek had difficulty getting around. He would have to use a wheelchair or zimmer frame. Kamil and his mum took turns looking after him. 'They worked different shift patterns. Sometimes the Red Cross would call at the house to help Leszek. 'We don't know what happened. It was a very quiet Bank Holiday, then around about 7am there were blue lights everywhere. Kamil was later led out of the house in handcuffs and dressed in a white forensic suit. 'They were a very quiet family, but very polite. When they first moved in they knocked on my door and gave me a cake as a gesture of goodwill. I enjoyed having them as neighbours. 'You never heard them rowing or arguing. There were never raised voices. We used to chat over the fence. They said they were looking forward to doing up the garden.' The family's home was surrounded by scaffolding, and neighbours said the local authority had spent thousands of pounds on a new roof and windows in recent weeks. Maria Pettinger, 35, was a work colleague of the 28-year-old at the Greencore sandwich factory in Worksop. She said: 'I have worked with Kamil for two years. He was known at work for being placid, quiet and over-polite. 'He and his parents came over here for Poland about seven years ago. There was nothing in his character which would make you think he could do anything violent. He was well-liked at work.' A police spokesman said: 'A man has been arrested following the deaths of two people in Worksop. 'The bodies of a man and a woman were found in a house just before 7am. 'Detectives are working to establish the circumstances surrounding their deaths. 'A 28-year-old man, who was arrested on suspicion of murder, is receiving treatment in hospital. 'The post mortems and formal identification are expected to conclude on Tuesday. A family liaison officer is working with the family at this difficult time.' Inspector Phil Davies, of Notts Police, said: 'I would like to reassure the community that incidents of this nature are very rare. This was an isolated incident and we have made an arrest. House to house enquiries and patrols will be continuing in the area to reassure residents.'

"By . Chris Greenwood . and Andy Dolan . A man has been jailed for just eight years after shaking and killing his partner’s son in a fit of rage. Craig Lewis broke Kieron Barley’s back and the toddler spent the last weeks of his life in agony after medical staff failed to diagnose the fracture. Kieron was in and out of hospital for four days after Lewis smashed him into the ground in a fit of anger. Kieron Barley with his mother Louise, who was jailed for 15 months for child neglect after her son's death . The 32-year-old electrician was sentenced to jail for manslaughter after admitting attacking the defenceless toddler. Kieron, . aged 22 months, underwent a battery of tests in hospital but was . allowed to go home after doctors diagnosed a tummy upset. It was only . three weeks later, after he suffered a fatal brain injury from a second . attack  by Lewis, that they realised his spine was fractured in  two . places. Last night, . Birmingham’s child protection authorities, already severely criticised . over cases, were plunged into fresh controversy for failing the tragic . toddler. Jailed: Craig Lewis and Louise Barley have both been imprisoned in connection with 22-month-old son Kieron . The tragedy bears haunting echoes of the death of Baby P in . Haringey, North London – another case in which doctors failed to . diagnose a broken back. Details of Kieron’s pain and suffering in the . weeks before his death were revealed for the first time yesterday as his . mother and her partner were jailed. The . day after the first attack, Lewis, a father of four, casually went on . holiday to a Center Parcs resort with his twin six-year-old girls from a . previous relationship. His . girlfriend, Louise Barley, 26, was jailed for 15 months after admitting . neglecting her son in the chaotic weeks after the first attack. Kieron Barley died after receiving the brunt of two attacks by his mother's boyfriend which caused him 'catastrophic damage' Lewis . first called paramedics to the family home in King’s Heath, Birmingham, . after he was left alone with the child on the afternoon of May 28, . 2011. He told the 999 operator that Kieron had ‘gone all floppy’ when he . fell and hit his head while trying to walk, Birmingham Crown Court was . told. The family were taken . by ambulance to Birmingham Children’s Hospital where Kieron was checked . by two consultants and had an X-ray of his shoulder. Kieron . spent the next day screaming and vomiting and Barley called NHS Direct . who told her to take him back to hospital, which she did after a delay . of several hours. Kieron was aged just 22 months at the time of his death from a combination immediate injuries, and ones sustained in previous attacks by Craig Lewis . After Lewis' attack on Kieron, they took him to hospital where the doctors said the toddler required more observation. Against the advice of their doctor, the couple removed the two from hospital and took him home . She told . one official: ‘He doesn’t sleep for long and just wakes up screaming – . if you have him on you and move slightly he screams at you.’ Kieron spent another night in hospital where he was diagnosed with ‘gastric flu’. May 28, 2011: . Lewis slams Kieron to the ground because he is not walking. Kieron goes . to Birmingham Children's Hospital where doctors fail to detect his . broken back. May 29, 2011: Kieron taken back into Birmingham Children's Hospital after screaming and vomiting but is discharged. May 30, 2011: Kieron taken back to Birmingham Children's Hospital where doctors diagnose possible gastroenteritis. June 19, 2011: . Lewis again attacks Kieron and hurls him into his cot causing bleeding . on the brain. Kieron rushed to Birmingham Children's Hospital. June 22, 2011: Kieron dies of massive injuries. July 7, 2011: Lewis and Barley appear in court charged with causing or allowing Kieron's death. April 4, 2014: . Lewis jailed for eight years after admitting manslaughter and causing . death of a child. Barley jailed for 15 months after admitting child . cruelty. It . was only after a second attack, on June 19, that experts discovered the . appalling extent of Kieron’s original injuries. The toddler was rushed . to hospital after Lewis shook him and threw him into his cot in another . rage, this time provoked by a wet nappy. Rachel . Brand QC, prosecuting, said: ‘Lewis lost his temper in the bedroom. He . shook Kieron causing the child’s head to move rapidly back and forth. He . then threw Kieron into the cot, causing his head to hit the railing.’ Paramedics . resuscitated Kieron on the floor of his home when he suffered a heart . attack and stopped breathing but he suffered fatal brain damage and . never regained consciousness. It was at this point doctors discovered two of his vertebrae had been broken. Lewis . and Barley were questioned by police the next day and several times . over the next two years but repeatedly lied, claiming they had done . nothing wrong. It was only earlier this year, when confronted with . overwhelming forensic evidence, that Lewis admitted inflicting the . injuries. A friend of the . family described Kieron as a ‘happy, quiet little boy’. ‘When I heard . what they did to him, I was disgusted,’ she said. ‘It’s taken way too . long to get to this point – we need answers.’ The . role of Birmingham Children’s Hospital, and other agencies, is at the . centre of a serious case review which will report later this year. A . hospital spokesman said: ‘Based on his physical presentation and the . information given by his mum and partner, we are satisfied that hospital . staff acted entirely appropriately.’","Craig Lewis, 32, inflicted catastrophic brain injuries on baby Kieron Barley .

"By . Andy Dolan . Blunder: Victoria Harrison, 17, slowly bled to death in her hospital bed after an artery was severed during a routine appendix operation at Kettering General Hospital . A hospital which suppressed details of the blunders that led to a teenage girl’s death to avoid causing stress to staff was forced to back down yesterday. Victoria Harrison, 17, slowly bled to death in her hospital bed after an artery was severed during a routine appendix operation. The trainee hairdresser texted a picture of her blood-soaked T-shirt to her boyfriend shortly before she died. An inquest in December was told that Kettering General Hospital had uncovered 43 errors in the teenager’s care. But the Northamptonshire hospital insisted that publishing details of the blunders could ‘endanger the mental health’ of their staff. It released the internal report to Victoria’s devastated father Andrew Harrison, 57, and mother Tracy Foskett, 42, but said it had a right to withhold information from the public. Details were released – with staff names redacted – after the BBC appealed under the Freedom of Information Act against the hospital’s refusal to release its findings. An internal panel agreed it was in the public interest to reveal the mistakes and the report’s recommendations. The report says staff did not check Miss Harrison’s abdomen, routine observations were discontinued, there was no formal pain assessment, there was inaccurate recording of her resuscitation, the wrong surgeon was named on documentation and nurses’ conduct was unprofessional. It reveals that ten staff were disciplined, but none dismissed. The case comes after recent assurances from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt that whistleblowers will be protected as part of efforts to create a culture of ‘openness and transparency’ in the NHS, which the minister said was vital to prevent a repeat of the Mid Staffordshire scandal where up to 1,200 patients died needlessly. Mrs Foskett, from Irthlingborough, Northamptonshire, yesterday called on all hospitals to publish such information to help prevent other tragedies from occurring. She said the hospital had initially told her ‘it would be better to keep the report private’ and that publication of parts of the report would compromise her daughter’s dignity. Mistakes: An inquest in December was told that Kettering General Hospital had uncovered 43 errors in the teenager¿s care . ‘Victoria hasn’t got any dignity now,’ she said. ‘She’s dead, they took all that away from her. What about my mental health? I have lost my shadow, my youngest daughter. ‘The public have the right to know what happened. My daughter should not die in vain.’ Victoria was given an emergency referral by her GP, who suspected appendicitis, in August 2012 . The surgeon realised he had damaged an artery during surgery and rectified the issue but Miss Harrison lost more than half a pint of blood. She texted her boyfriend with the picture to say she was bleeding later that day, but not all nursing staff were aware of the bleed and some did not routinely read medical notes. Despite complaining of being in pain nurses gave her morphine until she suffered heart failure and died. Northamptonshire Coroner Ann Pember’s narrative verdict criticised the hospital over missed opportunities and said, had these been acted upon, ‘the outcome may have been very different.’ Peter Walsh, from the patient safety charity Action against Medical Accidents, said the hospital’s original decision to suppress the report did not help public confidence and ran against the requirement for spirit of openness and transparency highlighted by the Mid Staffordshire scandal. The hospital has disclosed an action plan relating to each of the 43 errors.","Victoria Harrison, 17, bled to death in her bed at Kettering General Hospital .

"By . Rebecca Evans . and Andy Dolan . A teenage drug dealer who sold a batch of ecstasy that killed a 15-year-old schoolgirl has been spared prison after a judge despaired at ‘the folly of youth’. Alex Williams, 17, sold an ‘exceptionally’ pure version of the drug to a friend of GCSE pupil Martha Fernback. Martha died within hours of taking it. Williams pleaded guilty to supplying ecstasy, but instead of the ten-year jail term he might have received, he was given a three-month curfew and an 18-month youth rehabilitation order. Sentenced: Alex Williams (left), 17, was spared prison after he sold a fatal dose of MDMA to 15-year-old schoolgirl Martha Fernback (right) Tragedy: Martha Fernback collapsed and died shortly after taking the 'exceptionally' pure MDMA, sold to her by her friend Williams . A judge heard that Williams, an NVQ . student with a previous police warning for cannabis possession, was . ‘consumed by overwhelming guilt’. Martha’s . friend, who cannot be named for legal reasons, bought a gram of MDMA, . also known as ecstasy, for £40 on July 17 last year. Martha and her . friend split it between them. Williams made a £20 profit. The substance was deadly because it had a purity level of 91 per cent, compared with the average street level of 58. Oxford Crown Court heard that when he sold the drug, Williams, said: ‘This is new stuff so I’m not sure what it will be like.’ Despair: Sentencing, Judge Mary Jane Mowat expressed her 'incredulity at the folly of youth' who are prepared to take street drugs without knowing the dangers . Martha, . a middle-class Oxford schoolgirl, took her fatal dose three days later. After his arrest, police pleaded with Williams to tell them who, if . anyone else, he had sold it to so as to prevent more fatalities but he . refused to comment. Martha’s . mother, Anne-Marie Cockburn, said she could not remain angry with . Williams for the rest of her life and hoped to work with him to try to . change people’s minds about legalising and regulating drugs. Miss . Cockburn, who had raised Martha as a single parent since she was a . baby, said she does not believe ‘the war on drugs’ in the UK is working . and that a more realistic approach is needed. Sentencing . Williams on Monday, Judge Mary Jane Mowat said: ‘There is no escaping . the fact that, in part because of your actions, a 15-year-old girl lost . her life. ‘I have read a . [victim impact] statement from her mother and as the mother of an only . child myself in Oxford, every part of me resonates with the despair she . describes – and her incredulity at the folly of youth, and of those . willing to indulge in street drugs not knowing what is in them, where . they came from or what the potential dangers could be. ‘They always know better. Well, maybe this case will go some way towards persuading some children that they don’t.’ Yesterday . anti-drugs campaigner Mary Brett reacted with dismay at the sentence. ‘A sentence like that is no deterrent whatsoever, This  is dreadful. ‘The . policing of drugs is much too soft. It is ludicrous. You need to send a . signal that it is not acceptable to deal drugs – a short, sharp shock . is what is needed. In this case, a few weeks at least in prison would . have been warranted.’ Peter . Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention victims’ charity, added: ‘The lenience of this sentence is out of all proportion . to the deadly consequences of the crime committed. It is concerning when . claims of guilt are taken at face value and traded in for soft . sentences.’ The court heard . that three days after she got the ecstasy Martha, from North Oxford, . took her share of the drug and went to a park in the city with friends. Tributes: Mourners lay floral tributes at the scene in Hinksey Park, Oxford, where Martha died . Prosecutor . David Povall said Martha had used it before. ‘Martha was saying the . drugs were amazing, “It feels like a dream, it’s better than the last . time that we did it.”’ Her . friends then noticed that Martha was sweating a lot. She said she was . going for a swim in a pond to cool down. ‘At that point, Martha . collapsed,’ said Mr Povall. ‘Her legs went from underneath her.’ Shortly after arriving at hospital Martha died after suffering a cardiac arrest. Alistair . Grainger, defending Williams, said: ‘There’s not a day goes by when he . isn’t thinking about what has happened and is consumed by the . overwhelming guilt which flows from the consequences of his actions.’ Williams, . who claims on Facebook to be a McDonald’s manager, lives with his . mother Alison, 47, and brother Leon, 20, in a £200,000 semi-detached . house in the Botley area of Oxford. Reaching out: Martha's mother Anne-Marie Cockburn, said she would meet Williams and work with him to try to change people's minds about legalising and regulating some drugs . In . addition to the curfew and rehabilitation order, he was ordered to . undergo drug treatment and to work for charity. Williams, dressed in . low-slung tracksuit trousers, declined to comment last night. Martha’s mother, a 42-year-old marketing consultant, called for a different approach to drugs. ‘Martha . was a middle-class girl in a north Oxford school and look what . happened,’ she added. ‘That shows what the current drug education and . legislation lead to. There has got to be another way, because the . current way is not working.’ Miss . Cockburn has written a book describing in raw, painful detail the . moment she watched her only child die and chronicling her grief since.

"By . Emma Glanfield . and Andy Dolan . Jasvir Ram Ginday, 30, is accused of killing wife Varkha Rani, 24, on September 12 last year . A bank worker who married to conceal his homosexuality strangled his wife a few months later with a metal vacuum pipe, a court heard yesterday. Jasvir Ram Ginday throttled Varkha Rani and tried to destroy her remains in an incinerator after going through with the arranged marriage to please his parents. The couple tied the knot in a lavish ceremony in India last March – even though Ginday, 30, had confided in a friend years earlier that he was attracted to men, the jury were told. The defendant had travelled to  the subcontinent with his mother to find a bride and met several women before a match-maker known to both families introduced him to Miss Rani. Prosecutor Debbie Gould told a jury the couple became engaged ‘at the end of a meeting which lasted several hours’, with Miss Rani’s family believing Ginday to be ‘a perfect match for their intelligent, well-educated, and attractive young daughter’. The bride, who had completed a degree and a master’s degree in science and information technology in India, moved to the UK to live with Ginday in August after being granted a visa. But just a month later, police discovered the unrecognisable remains of the 24-year-old bride in the back garden of the home they shared with other members of Ginday’s family. Police at the scene of Jasvir Ram Ginday and Varkha Rani's house in Walsall, West Midlands, after her body was found in an incinerator in the back garden of the property . Wolverhampton Crown Court heard Ginday allegedly carried out the brutal attack on his wife because he was unable to pretend to be straight. The court heard he strangled his wife before forcing her body into the 22-inch deep incinerator and setting it alight . Miss Gould said that after killing his . wife, Ginday had forced her body into a 22-inch deep metal incinerator . in an alley beside their home. He called police that night to report her . missing – claiming she had walked out after assaulting him and had only . married him for a visa to get into the UK. Miss . Gould said: ‘His ultimate intention was to play the role of victim, . safe in the knowledge that he could rely on his married status as a . permanent excuse for never having another relationship with a . woman...his respectability and that of his family’s would be secured.’ Ginday, of Walsall, West Midlands, denies the charge of murder by has pleaded guilty to manslaughter and also a further charge of perverting the course of justice by lying to police . She . said Miss Rani was ‘in all senses a stranger in a strange land’ following her arrival in the UK last August, and appeared to be . isolated, friendless and alone. The . financially secure defendant, meanwhile, was ‘staring reality in the . face’ and would have had to explain any attempt to divorce his new . bride. ‘His marriage was motivated by a desire to please his parents and conceal his homosexuality from them,’ Miss Gould said. Forensic experts at the property in Walsall, . West Midlands, left, after the charred remains of 24-year-old Varkha . Rani were found by police officers, right, in an incinerator in the back . garden . ‘Over . the years the defendant made contact with gay chat lines to discuss his . sexuality, he developed a network of gay male friends and he attended . gay clubs in the Birmingham area.’ The . court head Ginday and his wife had been alone in the  house at Walsall, . West Midlands, on September 12, the day of the murder. That . afternoon, neighbours saw smoke and likened the smell to that which . comes from a crematorium. When one concerned resident knocked on . Ginday’s door, he claimed he was simply burning rubbish. Miss Gould said that on the day of the murder the couple were left alone in the house for the first time as both Ginday's parents, who also lived at the address, were out . Police searched . the property that night after Ginday made the missing persons report, . but they did not look in the garden. They returned the next night after neighbours reported seeing black smoke for the second day running. Although . Ginday had attempted to destroy his wife’s body, Wolverhampton Crown . Court heard that a woman police constable ‘lifted the lid (of the . incinerator) and found herself looking down on a human skull which was . severely burnt’. Prosecutor Debbie Gould said Ginday reported his wife missing on September 12 and told officers his wife had assaulted him before walking out of their home in Victory Lane, Walsall, pictured . Miss Gould . said the skull was not complete and had only a few teeth, while the . body was described as being ‘folded up and foetal-like’. Officers also discovered Miss Rani’s wedding ring inside the 22-inch deep incinerator. An . examination of computer equipment showed that somebody at the property . had searched for incinerators online around four weeks before Miss . Rani’s death. Police attended the house on September 12 last year after Mr Ginday reported his wife missing. However, officers did not find her body until the next day when they became suspicious of black smoke billowing from the property . CCTV images . also showed Ginday filling up a water bottle with petrol at a service . station just hours before the body was discovered. Pathologists . later confirmed the human remains were that of Miss Rani and that she . had  died from strangulation by a metal pole being placed across her . throat. Miss Rani’s father, . Surjit Singh told the jury he had no idea his son-in-law was gay, and . didn’t even know what the term meant. He said through an interpreter . that he had been ‘shocked and distressed’ after British police had . explained it to him. Wolverhampton Crown Court yesterday heard Ginday allegedly carried out the brutal attack on his wife because he was unable to pretend to be straight . He . added: ‘Of course I wouldn’t have let her marry him if I had known. I . have never heard of it before.

"By . Andy Dolan . A hospital is planning to introduce a high-tech solution to the high demand for its services - by offering consultations via Skype. NHS managers claim use of the free online video calling service could reduce outpatient appointments by 35 per cent. If the plans at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire get the go-ahead, it is thought the hospital would become the first in Europe to use Skype in this way. Bosses believe using Skype will not only ease demand on consultants’ time, but also free up car parking spaces on the site. University Hospital of North Staffordshire may be Europe's first to offer consultations via Skype . They say up to 180,000 patients a year could also benefit from the online consultations by contacting doctors from their office instead of taking time off work to visit the hospital. One hospital in North Wales already uses Skype - but only so nurses can monitor how dialysis patients use their equipment at home. The proposal is part of a range of schemes to ease pressure on the hospital, which is coping with higher-than-forecast increases in demand. They also include the possibility of doctors treating patients via email consultations. Typical of cases which could be seen by Skype video conference would be people who have had routine surgery or other treatment and simply need a doctor to review final scans before formally discharging them. Anyone needing face-to face contact and physical examinations will still be called in to the hospital, situated in Hartshill, Stoke-on-Trent. Officials admit planning for the move is still at an early stage, but it has the potential to slash the annual 517,000 outpatient appointments by 35 per cent. Chief executive Mark Hackett said: ‘Some patients take on technology better than others. But these methods could suit in particular the under-50s who now have to take time off work to get to appointments. The scheme could see annual outpatient appointments cut by up to 35 per cent (library image) ‘They would see it as a much more sensible way forward to avoid making trips to the hospital.’ The move has been welcomed by local health campaigners and business leaders - who said the plans would lessen the impact on the economy of patients taking time off work. Ian Syme, co-ordinator of pressure group North Staffordshire Healthwatch, said: ‘So long as the patient is confident using the system it sounds superb. But with vastly growing numbers of silver surfers, it must not be restricted to the young.’ Jane Gratton, deputy chief executive of Staffordshire Chambers of Commerce, added: ‘I think employers would support this as well as their workers. ‘For people to spend 10 minutes talking to the doctor while at work instead of having to take the whole day off would help their company’s productivity.’ The £400million hospital - built under a private finance initiative - has seen Accident and Emergency admissions soar by 11 per cent over the winter, compared to a forecast growth of just seven per cent. It also wants to help GPs by setting up ‘hot clinics’ where specialists can see patients with already-diagnosed conditions - and then send them straight back to their surgery without needing an admission to a ward. A further 50,000 patients-a-year could be seen by consultants running clinics in community settings. The scheme could help those in full time work who, rather than struggling to get an appointment, could speak with their doctor over the internet (library image) Last March, Whittington Hospital in Archway, North London said it was considering the introduction of a similar system of video consultations. A spokesman yesterday said the proposals were still on the drawing board and had not yet been implemented. In 2011, Ysbyty Gwynedd, in Bangor, North Wales, introduced Skype monitoring of dialysis patients - allowing them to use the machines at home under observation by nurses, who were able to troubleshoot any problems with the aid of the software’s webcam link. The following year, the Medical and Dental Defence Union of Scotland (MDDUS) said in advice to doctors that Skype could reduce the number of missed GP appointments and pose a better alternative to telephone consultations, as the doctor is also able to visually assess the patient.","Claimed Skype could reduce outpatient appointments by 35 per cent .

"By . Andy Dolan . Regrets? He might have had a few. But Jim McAllister, a Frank Sinatra tribute singer, was unabashed after smashing up an Indian restaurant and winding up in court. The globe-trotting vocalist went on the rampage after believing he had been short-changed by the owners. McAllister, 45, who has performed in Las Vegas, smashed a glass door and table lamp as he stormed out after singing at the Rajdoot Tandoori restaurant, near Droitwich, Worcestershire. Scroll down for videos. Old Blue Eyes: Jim McAllister wrecked an Indian restaurant after claiming that he had been underpaid for a gig . The singer admitted criminal damage . when he appeared before Worcester Magistrates’ Court. But he then . shrugged off the incident, saying: ‘That’s life.’ Prosecutor . Lesley Ashton told magistrates that McAllister had been booked last . June by restaurant owner Nina Tiara, who left an envelope containing . £300 for him as payment. But the singer claimed that a £400 fee had been . agreed following a previous date that was cancelled at the last minute. ‘Miss Tiara explained she would not be able to pay him the £400 and McAllister became agitated,’ said Miss Ashton. A man and his music: Jim McAlister is regarded as one of the best Sinatra impersonators having appeared as Ol' Blue Eyes around the world for 18 years including a stint in Las Vegas . The singer told the owner: ‘I’m getting done again by you’, before describing the manager of the restaurant as ‘a disgrace’. ‘McAllister . then stormed out of the conservatory and lashed out by punching a large . table lamp and then a fluted glass container used for storing water,’ said  Miss Ashton. ‘There was damage to  the door that was not there before he began to play  that night.’ Indian restaurant: It was here at the Rajdoot Tandoori that Frank Sinatra tribute singer Jim McAllister lost his temper and ended up in court . Magistrates . gave McAllister a 12-month conditional discharge, and he was ordered to . pay £670 in compensation to Miss Tiara, £85 in court costs and a £15 . victim surcharge. Sunil . Jagatia, defending, said McAllister performed all over the world and . previously had a good working relationship with Miss Tiara. She . was said to be a friend and the singer would perform at a reduced rate, . but the relationship ‘started to break down’ after several occasions . when Miss Tiara had cancelled gigs. Incomparable: Frank Sinatra wowed millions in a career lasting more than 50 years . Mr . Jagatia claimed that his client had been promised £400 and matters . ‘came to a head’ when McAllister discovered that only £300 had been . left. ‘He became very angry and lashed out,’ Mr Jagatia said. ‘He accepts the working relationship has broken down and just wants a speedy resolution to this, indicated by his plea.’ After the case, McAllister, from Halesowen, West Midlands, laughed off the conviction. Famous friends: James McAllister has played all over the world. Here he is with golfing legend Tony Jacklin (left) ‘I . did lose it and unfortunately as I left the restaurant I slammed the . door,’ he said. ‘The glass in it smashed, which is where the cost kicked . in. ‘I was just pushed over the edge. I have done the job for 18 years and have hundreds of happy clients. ‘Mr Sinatra was never adverse to a bit of publicity himself – whether it was good or bad – and I guess that is the case here. ‘To use one of the great man’s songs, that’s life.’","Singer was appearing at regular venue Rajdoot Tandoori in Droitwich .

"By . Andy Dolan . A Tory councillor posted a  picture showing a line-up of scantily clad women on Twitter – and compared it to the all-women shortlist used to choose a local Labour candidate. Richard Davies has been forced to apologise for the photograph of eight women in lingerie, which he posted with the caption: ‘Actual photo of  the hustings?’ The Lincolnshire County councillor and local party chief sent the post, which has since been deleted, to six local politicians including Lincoln MP Karl McCartney. Offensive? Richard Davies tweeted this photograph of women in underwear to Lincoln MP, Karl McCartney . The Lincolnshire county councillor apologised after Labour candidate Lucy Rigby, 31, said his tweet was sexist . Inner circle: Miss Rigby was selected to fight the seat of Lincoln at next year's General Election . Labour . uses all-women shortlists in an attempt to narrow the parliamentary . gender gap. However, critics say that  the policy is patronising to . women and  discriminatory to men. The . controversial process was used  to select solicitor Lucy Rigby as . Labour’s parliamentary candidate for the marginal seat of Lincoln in . 2012. Mother-of-one Miss . Rigby saw the  public post on the social networking site and retweeted . it to her 4,870 followers. She said: ‘Here’s Karl McCartney MP & . Tory Cllr discussing my selection to stand as a MP. & ppl q why . aren’t more women in politics.’ She . later added: ‘It is sad and entirely wrong that there appear to be, . still, some sections of the Conservative Party that have these attitudes . towards women and women working in politics. ‘It’s sad that they want to demean women so publicly, and Twitter is a very public forum. ‘Comparing . the selection of a female MP to an underwear modelling competition is . pretty pathetic and really speaks volumes about Karl McCartney and his . colleagues’ attitudes towards women.’ Gloria . De Piero, Labour’s spokesman for women, last night joined the fray by . writing to David Cameron to ask if he believes ‘there is any place in . politics or public life’ for Mr McCartney’s attitude. After . a storm of criticism online, Mr Davies was forced to apologise. He said . on Twitter: ‘Having reflected on this I think I was  wrong to post that . photo. AWS [all-women shortlisting] is sexist but glamour pics don’t . help. Sorry if I upset anyone.’ Apologetic: Later on Mr Davies realised his mistake and tweeted his followers again to apologise . Ms Rigby, a former solicitor, said Mr Davies had a 'demeaning and rather sad' attitude towards women . Yesterday . he said his post was ‘clumsy’ – but that it had at least been . successful in opening up a debate on Labour’s use of all-women . shortlists. It is still the only party to do so, although the Lib Dems . have recently toyed with introducing the practice in some cases. Mr . Davies, who is the chairman of the Conservative Association in Margaret . Thatcher’s home town of Grantham, said of the controversy: ‘This has . given us the opportunity to have a wider debate around all-women . shortlists. ‘You can dress . it up however you like, but if you discriminate against one group of . people on the grounds of gender that is discrimination. It should not be . allowed.’ But Miss Rigby said the councillor’s tweets were ‘symptomatic’ of sexism in the Conservative party. She added: ‘I appreciate that there is a debate, but pictures of underwear competitions is not the way to have it. ‘Only one in five Tory MPs is a woman. That is a very small number. The fact is that the Tory party has a problem with women.’ On . all-women shortlists, she added: ‘Quite a few people in the Labour . party would prefer not to have them. I happen to think they’re necessary . to get more women into politics. ‘I . think they have been successful when they have been used and half of . the Labour candidates that are standing in 2015 are women.’ She . added that Mr Davies had not apologised personally to her. A recent . COMRES poll suggests that Labour is ten points ahead of the Tories among . women voters. Mr . McCartney, who has a majority of just 1,058, said his comment was made . in reply to another  Twitter user who had picked up on the online . debate. The Conservative party press office declined to comment, saying it was up to Mr Davies to justify  his comments.","Richard Davies, 35, was discussing Labour All Women Shortlists (AWS)

"By . Andy Dolan . They were heralded as a demonstration of the travelling public’s integrity. But after introducing honesty boxes to help time-pressed customers quickly pay for their newspapers, retailer WH Smith has discovered some shoppers can no longer be trusted to pay the correct amount. The company installed the boxes at around 60 train station kiosks and airport shops nationwide, after a trial at two branches showed sales had risen and checkout queues had shrunk dramatically - with no increase in shoplifting. WH Smith put the honesty boxes in shops in train stations and airports to allow shoppers to pay quickly . But the store has now removed around a third of the boxes, which were sited near store newspaper racks and near store exits for customers who needed to buy a newspaper or magazine in a hurry. Staff at a shop in a London rail station said that the box there had been littered with paper, chewing gum and foreign coins. One assistant called it a ‘dishonesty box’ and another said: ‘You’d be surprised. People in suits. You turn your back ...’ The boxes - which initially looked more like dustbins than boxes - were the brainchild of an executive who had spent several years working in the US, where newspapers are often sold from vending boxes. A WH Smith spokesman said it had honesty boxes in about 60 shops, but ‘following some increasing concerns about the potential misuse of these facilities by a small minority, we have temporarily removed the honesty boxes from a small number of these locations’. The spokesman said the company was considering moving the boxes to a ‘more visible area within the store’. Joan Harvey, a psychologist at Newcastle . University, said that it was ‘petty theft’ but offenders justified not . paying the correct amount. A trail of the boxes showed that it increased paper sales and decreased queues but staff now have concerns about the system, with one staff member calling them 'dishonesty boxes' She suggested that people had become less honest because they perceived big businesses to be greedy, adding: ‘We change the goalposts of honesty to suit the cultural times we are living in.’ In a 2006 study of shoppers’ behaviour a picture of a pair of eyes or a picture of flowers were placed above an honesty box during alternate time periods. Wildly differing sums of money were deposited in the box. Dr Melissa Bateson, a behavioural biologist who led the study, said of it: ‘When we had the picture of eyes on the wall it was nearly three times as much money. Eyes give people the feeling that they are being watched by other people.’","Concept was based on American-style newspaper vending boxes .

"By . Harriet Arkell . and Andy Dolan . Sharmila Mistry, 42, was accused of causing the deaths of two toddlers when she was distracted by a mobile phone call. She has been found not guilty of causing death by dangerous driving . A BMW driver speeding and talking on her phone mounted the pavement and killed two toddlers, a court heard yesterday. Accounts . manager Sharmila Mistry, 42, was rushing to a meeting when she crashed . into another car, then swerved into the children in their pushchairs. She . was making a call on a hands-free mobile device and did not notice as a . car began to cross the junction ahead of her, the court heard. The . BMW hit the other driver’s Mini Cooper, then ploughed into Zofia . Tabaka, two, and 21-month-old Oliwier Baczyk as they waited at a . pedestrian crossing with family members. Oliwier . and Zofia, whose parents are Polish, died of head injuries later that . day. Mistry’s BMW 520d executive saloon was seen accelerating towards the . junction in Leicester and was exceeding the 30mph speed limit, the jury . was told. Mini driver . Christopher Andrews had become confused by roadworks and was crossing . the junction against a red light, prosecutor James Thomas said. In . the build-up to the tragedy on the morning of August 6, 2012, Mistry . overtook a van and, according to a witness, sped towards the junction, . passing through the traffic lights just after they had turned to amber. Mr . Thomas told the hearing at Leicester Crown Court:  ‘Mistry was engaged . in a mobile phone call on hands-free. She did not notice Mr Andrews . enter the junction. ‘As the Mini drove across the junction it collided with the front off-side of the defendant’s BMW. ‘That . diverted her BMW directly into the path of the children as they were . sat in their pushchairs waiting to cross the road. 'The consequences were . devastating and ultimately fatal. ‘The . prosecution case is that their deaths resulted from a combination of . the driving of Christopher Andrews and Sharmila Mistry, which the . prosecution say fell below the standard expected of a competent and . careful driver.’ Mr Thomas told the court Mistry ‘neither braked nor took evasive action’ before the collision. ‘Her vehicle was struck by Mr Andrews’ Mini and only after did she apply the brakes,’ he said. Zofia’s . father, Lucas Tabaka, had been pushing her, while Oliwier was . accompanied by an uncle, Kamil Komar. Killed: Oliwier Baczyck, 21 months, and Zofia Tabaka, two, were fatally injured after the accident in Leicster . Terror: The two toddlers (circled left) could be seen on CCTV footage sat in their pushchairs just moments before a car driven by Mistry (right) mounted the pavement and smashed into them . Both adults, who had been shopping . with the children, escaped with minor injuries. Crash . investigators discovered Mistry, who denies two counts of causing death . by careless driving, was travelling at 36mph when she collided with the . Mini. Motorist Matthew Smith told the court how Mistry’s BMW went ‘flying’ past him as he slowed for the amber light at the junction. He said: ‘The BMW got sent off to the left. She did try to correct herself but was going too fast.’ Scene: The two children were waiting with two adults at this junction in Leicester when they were hit by a car . 'RIP baby angels': Floral tributes were left at the scene where the two young children were hit by the car . Mr Smith said that after the crash he saw a woman climb out of the BMW, shouting: ‘I’m so sorry.’ The . court heard 61-year-old Mr Andrews had ‘misconstrued’ a green light . telling traffic to turn left, believing he could cross the junction. He . has since died in circumstances unrelated to the case. Mr Thomas said that had Mistry been travelling at the speed limit she would have had time to brake. After . her arrest, Mistry, of Bushby, Leicestershire, told police she had been . driving the BMW, which costs from £30,000, ‘carefully and . consistently’. She denied accelerating towards the junction. Car: A Facebook picture of a black BMW on the profile of Sharmila Mistry, who appeared in court today . In a statement read to the court, Mr Tabaka said the group were hit as they waited on an island to  cross the dual carriageway. ‘I suddenly saw the red Mini Cooper collide with a grey BMW,’ he said. ‘I . tried to pull away the pushchair with my daughter in it, but the car . hit both pushchairs. I was still holding the pushchair but her little . head was bowed down and blood was coming down her face.’ In his statement, Mr Komar said he saw the female driver ‘motionless’ after the crash, ‘with a mobile phone in her hand’. The trial continues. Later, the court heard heartbreaking evidence from Lucas Tabaka, father of two-year-old Zofia. In a statement read to the court by Mr Thomas, Mr Tabaka - who was waiting at the side of the road with family friend Kamil Komar, who was pushing Oliwier, told of the moment his daughter was struck by the BMW. He said: 'Because the lights were on green we crossed half of the road and stopped on island. 'I suddenly saw the red Mini Cooper collide with a grey BMW. 'I shouted to Kamil ""Watch out"". I tried to pull away the pushchair with my daughter in it but the car hit both pushchairs with the children in them. Scene: Marking on the pavement indicate where the children were struck as they waited in their pushchairs . 'I was still holding the pushchair but her little head was bowed down and blood was coming down her face. 'I was screaming and shouting at a man who came to help to check her breathing.  Oliwier was on the ground in a pool of blood.' In his statement Mr Komar, who is the cousin of Oliwier's mother, Miroslawa, said: 'Lucas asked me to join him for a walk. Defendant: Sharmila Mistry, 42, denies two counts of causing death by careless driving . 'Oliwier always wanted to push the crossing button. I heard a terrible bang and someone shout ""Watch out"". 'My immediate reaction was to pull the pushchair away. I saw Oliwier on the floor and heard Lucas shout ""Save my beloved daughter"". 'I just had a grazed chin. I saw the female driver motionless with a mobile phone in her hand.' Motorist Matthew Smith told the court how Mistry's BMW came 'flying' past him as he slowed for an amber light. He . said he believed she drove through a red light, but the jury earlier . heard she passed through just 0.8 seconds before it the signal changed . from amber to red. Mr Smith added: 'I saw the BMW quite far back from myself. 'It . was driving at some speed. I say that because of the rate it caught me . up.  As the BMW went past me I caught a glimpse of the red Mini and they . collided. 'The BMW got sent off to the left. She did try to correct herself but was going too fast.' Mr Smith told the jury a woman climbed out of the BMW shouting ""I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry"".' He added: 'She was a bit distraught. I didn't really take much notice of her because we were too busy seeing what we could do.'

"By . Andy Dolan . Sacked: Science teacher Richard West was sacked after he accidentally shot 17-year-old pupil Ben Barlow in the leg with a pellet gun during a classroom experiment . A teacher has been sacked after he accidentally shot a pupil with an air gun. But the boy he injured has begun a Facebook campaign calling for him to be given his job back. Popular physics teacher Richard West had been demonstrating an experiment to measure the deceleration of a pellet as it passed through sheets of paper when the freak accident occurred. The pellet apparently deflected off a table, hitting 17-year-old AS-level pupil Ben Barlow in the leg. Yesterday, as the Facebook page he set up in support of Mr West passed 2,170 ‘likes’, Ben said a safety pin could have caused him more harm. He said he decided to study physics because of the 53-year-old teacher’s ability to ‘make the subject come alive’. About 20 lower-sixth formers at St Peter’s Collegiate, Wolverhampton, volunteered to hold sheets of paper at arms-length over a line of desks, Ben said. He was about three-quarters of the way down the line when he was struck. ‘The bullet travelled through the first ten or 11 sheets, then it must have hit a desk below and cannoned into me,’ he said. ‘It was just a momentary pain, like when you walk into the corner of a table. I was left with just a scratch.’ Following the accident in November, Mr West was ‘extremely concerned and apologetic’ and the experiment was halted. Ben mentioned the incident to his mother that night, and she spoke to the school. Mr West was suspended soon afterwards and dismissed last week following a disciplinary hearing. It is understood that he was found guilty of gross misconduct. Ben said he has written to school governors in protest at Mr West’s dismissal. A source said senior figures at the school were aware that head of science Mr West had sometimes used a pellet gun – which is legal for adults to buy and possess – in experiments. Popular: While some parents at the school have  labelled Mr West 'irresponsible', pupils including Ben have started a campaign calling for him to be re-instated . Yesterday father-of-two Mr West, who . lives with wife Marion, 54, in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, said he wanted . his job back but refused to comment further for fear of jeopardising his . appeal against dismissal. Friends said the teacher was ‘devastated’ at the loss of his unblemished 20-year career at the school. But . one parent said: ‘I can’t believe a teacher thought it was appropriate . to take a gun into a school. Surely there are safer ways to do this . experiment than taking a deadly weapon into the classroom?’ Disciplined: The incident happened in November and it is believed Mr West was suspended soon afterwards, before being permanently sacked this week . Campaign: Dozens of pupils past and present left comments on the Facebook page Bring Back Westy 2014, calling Mr West a 'true inspiration', the 'best teacher ever' and 'the king of St Peter's' Head teacher Adrian Richards said Mr West was sacked after a full investigation. ‘As we are still in the appeal phase of the process, it would be inappropriate to comment any further,’ he added. Ben said pupils taught by Mr West in 1997 had offered support on his Facebook page, Bring Back Westy 2014. Pupil Isabella Leadbeater, 17, said: ‘We’re infuriated about this and Mr West has been humiliated.’ Tim . Cooper, a former English teacher at St Peter’s, said Mr West was ‘one . of the best teachers I’ve ever had the privilege of teaching with’.","Richard West used a pellet gun to demonstrate bullet deceleration to pupils .

"By . Andy Dolan . A teacher who had an affair with a 16-year-old pupil yesterday told of the ‘ten days of madness’ which culminated in her spending the night in his bed. Married Bernadette Smith, 35, kissed and cuddled Gary Ralston after the teenager’s father invited her into their home – but said she kept a tiny vest top on and did not have sex with the boy. Yesterday the mother of three blamed her husband Brian’s continued deceit over an affair which had resulted in a love child for triggering her own sordid behaviour with the teenager. Split: Bernadette Smith, 35, blamed her husband Brian's continued deceit over an affair which had resulted in a love child for triggering her own behaviour with Gary Ralston, 16. Above, Smith with her estranged husband . Affair: Smith (left) kissed and cuddled Gary (right) after the teen's father, Richard, invited her into their home . She learned of his infidelity only when the Child Support Agency began chasing him for maintenance. The English and history teacher claimed she started her affair after trying to be a ‘positive influence’ and help Gary. She said: ‘There never came a point where I thought I was attracted to him. I just knew I was thinking about him too much. ‘We were starting to have conversations which went beyond what should be said between a teacher and a pupil. He told me things about his home life, and, stupidly, I started to tell him about the problems in my marriage. Waived anonymity: The English and history teacher spent the night in Gary's bed - but said she kept a tiny vest on and did not have sex with the teenager. Above, Gary poses in his bedroom  in Cowie, Stirlingshire . ‘I want to say sorry to Gary. I only . became interested in him because I wanted to help him. I wanted to be . something positive in his life and I ended up being the opposite.’ Smith . was handed a two-year supervision order last week and has been put on . the sex offenders’ register after admitting to engaging in sexual . activity with a pupil while in a position of trust last September. Smith . revealed how she told Gary – who waived his right to anonymity in his . own interview last week – at school that she had developed feelings for . him. Claims: Smith said she learned of her husband's infidelity only when the Child Support Agency began chasing him for maintenance. She claimed she started her affair after trying to be a 'positive influence' and help Gary . 'Proud': Last week, Mr Ralston (left) admitted being 'a bit' proud of his son for catching the teacher's (right) eye . They later drove to a local park, . spending ‘hours’ talking and kissing in her car. Within days, they had . kissed again, but Smith was unaware that Gary had told his father . Richard, whom he lived with, about the relationship. In Saturday’s Daily Mail, Mr Ralston admitted to being ‘a bit’ proud of his son for catching the attractive teacher’s eye and said he felt sorry for her when she was arrested. But Gary’s grandmother complained to the school and the police were brought in. Smith was suspended and left the marital home, going straight to the Ralstons’ house in Cowie, Stirlingshire. Scene: Smith has been handed a supervision order for two years and put on the sex offenders' register after admitting engaging in sexual activity with a pupil while in a position of trust at Bannockburn High School (above) Mr Ralston – who separated from Gary’s . mother, Carol Morgan, when the boy was a toddler – allowed her into his . son’s bedroom, where the pair spent the night together, though both . insist they did not have sex. Smith said: ‘I took off my T-shirt and lay on his bed. I had a wee vest top on underneath. He was under the covers but I wasn’t. We did kiss that night as well.’ She was arrested the next day – after going to Gary’s home again. Smith, of Denny, Stirlingshire, claimed her marriage to her childhood sweetheart – which is now over – began crumbling in 2009 when the Child Support Agency requested maintenance for a boy her husband had fathered with another woman. The child was conceived nine months after the Smiths married in 2005. Mr Smith, a bus driver, claimed the child was the product of a one-night stand and his wife decided to forgive him. But she told how she later discovered her husband had continued the affair with the child’s mother, who was also married. She said: ‘I thought my world had ended.’","Bernadette Smith, 35, kissed and cuddled Gary Ralson, 16, at Cowie home .

"By . Andy Dolan . A mother who was so addicted to sugar she consumed the equivalent of 50 teaspoons a day has told how kicking the habit has transformed her life. Nikki Oakley ate chocolate biscuits for breakfast, substituted supper with puddings and raided the sweet cupboard during years of overindulgence to satisfy her cravings. Yesterday, the 45-year-old said that while her sugar habit did not cause her weight to balloon, it was an ‘emotional crutch’ that she turned to for a pick-me-up or even because she was bored. Unhealthy: Sugar addict Nikki Oakley with a typical day's menu, including crisps, soft drinks and chocolate . The mother-of-two said her addiction . was so severe that when she quit sugar she would often burst into tears . and was short-tempered, listless and depressed. She also suffered severe . headaches. ‘It took a . fortnight for those feelings to subside,’ she said. ‘Everywhere I looked . there were people eating bags of sweets, ice-creams and drinking fizzy . drinks. Shopping was torture. I would walk up the aisles looking at the . biscuits, feeling like crying, I wanted them so much. ‘It was a cycle – I ate sugary foods as a pick-me-up, but after the high came a low and I would need more. ‘But once I’d got through those first few weeks I started to feel so much better – calmer but more alert and with more energy.’ In . the old days, if Mrs Oakley did have proper meals they consisted of . sugar-laden cereal bars for breakfast, sandwiches with crisps and cake . for lunch and processed ready meals for dinner with dessert. Occasionally . she would cook a curry or sweet and sour dish but the sauce would be . from a jar and therefore high in sugar. Throughout the day she would . snack on cookies, pies, sweets and chocolate bars. She would also sip on . fizzy drinks all day. Now, . however, she has porridge for breakfast, chicken or ham salad for lunch . and snacks on oatcakes with low-fat hummus, berries and natural yoghurt . sprinkled with nuts or raisins. Instead of relying on microwaveable . meals for dinner, she cooks curries, stir-fries and spaghetti bolognese . from scratch without sauces from jars. Healthier: Since being diagnosed a sugar addict and put on a diet, Nikki says she's much healthier . Upsetting: Nikki says her sugar addiction left her in tears while navigating the supermarket sweet aisle . And . Mrs Oakley, who works as a childminder and lives in Redditch, . Worcestershire, with electrician husband Glyn, also 45, has cut  out . puddings completely. She  had always jogged and now she is running . faster than ever. Her weight has also dropped from 9st 11lb to 8st 7lb. To . help her change her ways, Mrs Oakley contacted The Healthy Employee, . which works with companies to educate workers on diet and wellbeing to . improve health and cut absenteeism. Its specialists deemed her a sugar . addict. Anna Mason, who runs . the company, warned yesterday that sugar could be ‘more powerful than . any opiates’ and said Britain is ‘hooked on processed food’. She added: . ‘Many people on an apparently healthy diet can be consuming 40 to 50 . teaspoons of sugar a day eating things like granola bars – which are . held together with sugary syrup – or baked beans, which have sugar in . the sauce.’ Mrs Oakley has been on a  no-sugar diet since last September because even the smallest amount can reignite her cravings. However, . she admitted that she has occasionally been unable to resist temptation . and recently had a gingerbread biscuit when baking with the children . she cares for. She said of . her addiction: ‘It takes hold after the first few mouthfuls of intense . pleasure – I would start putting food into my mouth, even though I don’t . really want it. ‘Your head is telling you to stop, but you just can’t.’ The . recommended daily sugar intake for a woman is six teaspoons, according . to the World Health Organisation, but the typical Briton will consume . double that. At a time when . obesity and diabetes cost the UK more than £5billion a year, campaign . group Action on Sugar is calling on food manufacturers to cut the sugar . in their products by 20 to 30 per cent within the next three to five . years.

"By . Andy Dolan . The partner of a woman who was stabbed to death alongside her two-year-old son yesterday condemned a serious case review which concluded that the tragedy could not have ‘reasonably predicted’. Rachael Slack was pregnant with Robert Barlow’s child when she was knifed to death with 23-month-old son Auden in full view of a neighbour at her home. In October, an inquest jury ruled the deaths were ‘more than minimally contributed to by a [police] failure to impress upon’ Miss Slack the conclusion of a police risk assessment which placed the victims at high risk of death or serious injury at the hands of Auden’s unstable father, Andrew Cairns. Tragedy: Rachael Slack and her son Auden were murdered by his father who made repeated threats to kill her - but experts said today her death could not have been predicted . Anger: Pictured on ITV's Daybreak, Robert Barlow said the report had not gone far enough . But the serious case review by Derby Safeguarding Children Board (DSCB) makes no mention of the inquest jury’s findings and concludes that the . tragedy could not have been foreseen with information known at the time. Cairns, 44, a former golf tutor, killed the pair at Miss Slack’s cottage . in Holbrook, Derbyshire, in June 2010, after she had told him she was . having a baby with Mr Barlow - the childhood sweetheart she had resumed . contact with via Facebook. Killer: Andrew Cairns told  Rachael he would attack her, and was even arrested, only to be released and hack her to death . After the killings Cairns, originally from Lancashire, took his own life and was found slumped over the other bodies. Cairns had been arrested for threatening to kill ex-lover Miss Slack, 38, less than a week before the bloodbath. But while police called the human resources manager the next day to advise her that a decision had been taken to bail Cairns while inquiries continued - officers failed to impress upon her the conclusions of a risk assessment they had conducted on Cairns while he was being held. Derbyshire Police then compounded their blunder that evening when Cairns’ neighbour reported that he was considering abducting Auden. An officer was despatched to carry out a ‘safe and well’ check on Cairns, but despite initially discovering the golf tutor’s home empty, merely telephoned Miss Slack to check she was OK. Yesterday Mr Barlow, 42, a joinery company boss, was backed by Miss Slack’s family and a domestic abuse charity in criticising the SCR’s findings. ‘I don’t agree with it at all’, he said. ‘There was so much information that was scattered over so many professional agencies, (yet) they couldn’t put it all together to make a professional judgement call, that could have made a difference to Rachael and Auden’s life. New partner: Robert Barlow says Rachael and Auden were failed and 'could have been alive today' but police ignored the threats to kill . In danger: Cairn was bailed with conditions not to contact Miss Slack or Auden and an assessment placed Rachael at a 'high risk of homicide' ‘Derbyshire Police should be damned for not telling her she was at risk of homicide. These things can’t just fall to the wayside. ‘The (agencies) just didn’t share the information with us or one another. The left hand didn’t know what the right was doing.’ Miss Slack’s family said they would write to the chair of the Safeguarding Children’s Board to express their concerns. Her mother and brother, Jean and Haydon Slack, said in a statement: ‘We cannot understand why the Serious Case Review omitted from its description of the inquest jury’s verdict the finding that failings by the police contributed to the unlawful killing of Auden. ‘It makes us wonder whether the authorities who were party to this report, including Derbyshire police, are serious about improving the service they give to women and children facing domestic violence.’ Cairns had been receiving treatment for depression with Derbyshire Mental Health Services Trust for over two years before the tragedy and had come into contact with police on a number of occasions. He was detained by police under the Mental Health Act on May 26, 2010 - a week before the killings - after Miss Slack could not get him to leave her car. He was assessed by mental health workers and released after he was found to have no major mental illness. New life: Cairns began threatening Rachael when she told him she was expecting another child with her new partner Robert Barlow . Signs: Cairns had been known to the authorities since 1999 after he attempted suicide . The following day Cairns was arrested . after warning Miss Slack: ‘You’ve no idea what I’m capable of. I’ll kill . you and take him with me.’ The 76 page SCR, published yesterday, said . Derbyshire Constabulary received about 150 to 160 reports of threats to . kill each year. This was the only one where the threat was ‘followed by . enactment’ in the last three years. The . report criticised the way agencies shared information about Cairns and . said they focussed on his needs rather than the those of the mother and . child, and failed to consider adequately the danger he could have posed . to them. So far no one involved has lost their job or been disciplined over the deaths. The . independent chair of the Derbyshire Safeguarding Children Board, . Christine Cassell, said the report highlighted the importance of ‘making . sure agencies understand that they must think about the entire family’, . regardless of ‘the person they’re working with primarily’. Sandra . Horley, chief executive of the Refuge national domestic violence . charity, said she was concerned that the report had described incidents . of murder or suicide involving a family with a child as ‘incredibly . rare’, when ‘two women each week are killed in England and Wales by . current or former partners.’","Andrew .

"By . Andy Dolan . A soldier who had post-traumatic stress disorder after seeing five colleagues shot in Afghanistan was jailed for six years yesterday for killing his infant daughter. Liam Culverhouse, 25, left seven-week-old Khloe with severe brain damage and multiple fractures to her skull, ribs and limbs. Just over a week before the attack, Culverhouse told neighbours and other family members how he could not cope with a crying child. Jailed for six years: Liam Culverhouse (right), 25, arrives at Northampton Crown Court for his sentencing . Khloe died 17 months later after contracting pneumonia, having remained in hospital and hospice care for the rest of her short life. The former Grenadier Guardsman had cheated death when he was shot six times – losing his right eye – after a rogue Afghan policeman sprayed his base in Helmand Province with bullets in November 2009. The following August he was referred for anger management after confiding in a military GP how he would fly off the handle since the ordeal – and no longer trusted himself to handle crying children on his own. But by the first anniversary of the Helmand massacre, Culverhouse had stopped attending the therapy sessions and was discharged soon after. He went on to attack Khloe, his daughter with ‘on-off’ partner Claire Abrams, 25, at their Northampton home in May 2011 – nine days before telling an inquest into the Helmand massacre how he had ‘played dead’ to avoid being shot. Sentencing: Liam Culverhouse (left, in his mugshot) is also pictured outside court with his father (right) He admitted causing or allowing the . death of his daughter at an earlier hearing and was jailed yesterday at . Northampton Crown Court. Sentencing him, Mr Justice Baker said it was clear the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder had contributed to the tragedy. 'I hope that the prison sentence affords him the chance to reflect on his actions and be truly remorseful for failing to adequately care for his child' Detective Chief Inspector Steve Woliter, Northamptonshire Police . He told Culverhouse: ‘No one who has understood what happened to you in November 2009 whilst serving as a member of the British Army in Afghanistan can have anything but profound sympathy for the effect which it had upon you. 'Not only will you have to live with the physical symptoms including blindness in your right eye, but it is clear that the trauma of that and of witnessing the death of a number of your fellow soldiers has caused you to suffer from significant psychological damage’. But the judge said that while Culverhouse, who was medically discharged from the Army last April, had acknowledged  that he had problems controlling his temper, by ceasing his therapy he had ‘failed to alleviate that risk’. He was initially arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. The baby had been attacked on at least four occasions, the court heard. Speaking after the case, Detective Chief Inspector Steve Woliter, said Culverhouse was a ‘very troubled man … and clearly unfit to look after a small baby’. Never recovered: Khloe Abrams died at the Rainbow Children's Hospice in Loughborough in November 2012 . In March 2010, Culverhouse appeared in a Channel 4 documentary in which he told how he played dead during the attack in Afghanistan when the gunman shot him six times in his face and both arms and legs as he tried to escape. He described the moment he heard the footsteps of the gunman pacing over to him to make sure he was dead. The shootings sent shockwaves through the Nato mission in Afghanistan. Cutting Edge: A documentary on the attacks in Afghanistan in which Culverhouse was injured featured footage of the critical care air support team treating the Grenadier Guards injured . Danger: In the documentary, Culverhouse said he and his colleagues picked up a 'funny atmosphere' at the checkpoint before the shooting . Those killed in the shooting were . Warrant Officer Class 1 Darren Chant, 40, Sergeant Matthew Telford, 37, . and Guardsman Jimmy Major, 18, of the Grenadier Guards, and Corporal . Steven Boote, 22, and Corporal Nicholas Webster-Smith, 24, of the Royal . Military Police. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the killings but British military sources suggested it was more likely that the incident was a one-off and unconnected to insurgents. The rogue gunman has never been caught. In the documentary, Culverhouse said he and his colleagues picked up a 'funny atmosphere' at the checkpoint before the shooting but could not have predicted what happened. The soldier revealed that the troops were having a competition to see who could catch the most mice when the policeman opened fire. He said: 'I remember getting hit in the face with something and I remember shouting and swearing. 'I remember saying, ""f****** hell, what was that?"" and I covered my face and turned around to see the back of an Afghan, one of the police officers, shooting the lads.'

"By . Andy Dolan . Dianne Howell was told she needed physiotherapy due to poor posture. Pictured with her son, Luke O'Reilly, the 61-year-old died of pancreatic cancer months after first visiting doctors . For eight months, Diane Howell suffered severe back and stomach pain. Doctors told her she needed physio for poor posture and so the mother of one struggled on in her shop job. Only after 15 consultations was she referred to a specialist. By then the pain had got so intolerable she was rushed to hospital, where it finally emerged that she had pancreatic cancer. She died three months later. Now her family say she was showing classic symptoms of the disease and it should have been spotted by doctors far sooner. Her son Luke O’Reilly has made a formal complaint against the medical centre that treated her. Miss Howell’s pain began in January and her medical records show she visited Lombard Medical Centre in Newark, Nottinghamshire, at least 15 times between April and August, seeing five different doctors as her condition deteriorated. The centre sent Miss Howell for tests, including a chest X-ray and renal ultrasound that tested her kidneys. Her bladder, uterus and abdominal aorta were also tested. She underwent a breast neoplasm screening, which her medical records show was normal. She was finally referred to a colorectal surgeon after a visit to the surgery in August, with an appointment for 12 days’ time. But her pain got so bad that her son had to take her to hospital before the appointment. She was admitted to King’s Mill Hospital, Sutton-in-Ashfield, and six days later was told she had metastatic pancreatic cancer. Following the diagnosis, Mr O’Reilly, 28, began researching the condition on the internet. He said: ‘When I typed my mother’s . symptoms into Google one of the first diagnoses is pancreatic cancer. ' I’m not naive and I’m not suggesting that anyone can be diagnosed by . looking at Google, but the symptoms were obvious. Mum lost 2½-stone in . five months.’ Mr O'Reilly (pictured with his mother and girlfriend, Lucy Toule) has lodged a formal complaint against the medical centre that failed to diagnose his mother's cancer . The cancer had . spread to her liver, lungs, and spleen, and she died at Beaumond House . Community Hospice in her home town of Newark on November 19. Mr O’Reilly said if his mother’s . condition had been diagnosed earlier he could have spent her last few . months fulfilling her final wishes and she may have even survived long . enough for them to spend this Christmas together. ‘I could have taken her on trips so she could do the things she wanted to do,’ he said. ‘I may have been able to spend Christmas with her, but for the first time in 28 years I wasn’t with her at Christmas.’ Miss Howell separated from her son’s father when he was a child and Mr O’Reilly senior remains in regular contact with his son. She . worked for more than 20 years on the shop floor at discount chain . Wilkinson and was signed off with pain shortly before her diagnosis. Luke O'Reilly has lodged a formal complaint against Lombard Medical Centre in Nottinghamshire where his mother was treated . Metastatic pancreatic cancer means the disease spreads through the bloodstream to other organs. It is usually terminal so treatment focuses on pain relief. Dr Andrew Parkin, a senior partner at Lombard Medical Centre, said he was sorry to learn of Miss Howell’s death but he can’t comment on individual cases. Dr Mark Jefford, of NHS Newark and Sherwood Clinical Commissioning Group, said: ‘Anyone with any issues about the quality of care they get from any of our health providers should discuss their specific concerns with the provider involved as soon as possible.’","Dianne Howell was told by doctors she needed physio for poor posture .

"By . Andy Dolan . and Lucy Osborne . and Christian Gysin . A family doctor is being investigated after it emerged an elderly patient of his changed her will days before her death to leave his daughter a share of her £560,000-plus estate. Lucie Rose, 87, killed herself with an overdose of pills which her  sister said had been prescribed by her GP, Dr Chittaranjan Pillai. Nine days earlier she altered her will to state that her late husband's car and the couple's £250,000 bungalow should go to the 63-year-old GP's daughter Sharnika, who friends believe Mrs Rose had never met. Lucie Rose, pictured with her late husband, John, killed herself nine days after changing her will . Yesterday her relatives said she could . not have been of sound mind when she changed the will and insisted she . must have fallen  victim to 'criminal acts'. Mrs . Rose, who had no children, died in November 2010. She had lost her . husband John, 86, to cancer 11 days before she altered the will. She . had originally planned to leave everything to her two sisters in . Germany, the couple's only  surviving relatives. But yesterday the . youngest sister, Elke Schmaing, said she had been stunned to hear the . house and car had gone to the GP's daughter. Much . of the rest of the cash – in the region of £300,000 – was left to . another individual. Money was also left to four charities, but Mrs . Rose's sisters Anneliese Keller and Mrs Schmaing were left just a watch . and some jewellery. Mrs . Schmaing accused police of failing to investigate the matter properly. She claimed the fact that her sister's suicide note was  written in . English was suspicious because she 'still spoke and wrote in German'. Mrs . Schmaing even suggested that she did not think her sister would have . taken her own life in the way alleged. Although she acknowledged that . her sister had spoken about taking her life after the death of her . husband, a former salesman, she said her sister had planned to go . 'somewhere like  Dignitas in Switzerland – not by taking pills on her . own'. Mrs Rose named 23-year-old Sharnika Pillai (right) - the daughter of her doctor Dr Chittaranjan Pillai (left) - as one of two beneficiaries . Nottinghamshire Police . – who had lost the suicide note by the time of Mrs Rose's inquest – . have already been criticised by a coroner over the 'shoddiness' of their . investigation into the death. Mrs . Schmaing, 69, speaking from her home in the spa town of Bad Iburg near . Osnabruck, told the Daily Mail that she and Mrs Keller, 75, had spent . three years trying to find out why the will was changed. She . said: 'We were very close and I would ring Lucie almost every day. This . is not the sort of thing she would do. I feel there have been criminal . acts carried out here. 'She . was confused before she died. She told me a financial adviser was trying . to make her make a new will. Her will was completely changed days . before she died and was drawn up by a different solicitor to the . original will she had.' A . friend of the Roses, who did not wish to be named, also held suspicions . about the suicide note. The friend said it was written on expensive . writing paper, but Mrs Rose was notoriously frugal and would not have . bought such paper. The change in the will meant that her doctor's daughter received Mrs Rose's £250,000 bungalow . NHS . England is investigating the doctor's connection to the will and his . surgery's 'medicine management' in relation to Mrs Rose. She . met her husband when he was stationed in Germany during the Second . World War. They moved back to his home city of Nottingham in 1949. At . an inquest in November 2011, Nottinghamshire coroner Mairin Casey . recorded a verdict of suicide but said 'there may well have been a . suggestion' the Roses were 'vulnerable to influence from an outside . third party'. Elke Schmaing, pictured with her sister Mrs Rose, is challenging the will because she does not believe her sister was of sound mind when she signed it . Mrs Rose and her husband were treated at Plains View Surgery in Mapperley, Nottinghamshire, for many years . But she agreed . with professionals – including Dr Pillai – who had considered Mrs Rose . to be of sound mind when she made the new will. The . pensioner was on medication for what is thought to have been a heart . condition when she died.  Dr Pillai, known as Chit, is based at Plains . View Surgery in the Mapperley area of Nottingham. His Nottingham-born . wife Ann, 47, is understood to be the practice  manager. Sharnika, 23, . is listed amongst the administrative staff. The family live in upmarket Lowdham, Nottinghamshire. There was no answer at their extended cottage yesterday. NHS . England said an investigation into aspects of Mrs Rose's  case was . ongoing. In a statement Dr Pillai said the surgery had 'engaged fully . with the NHS  England investigation'. Sharon . Quinn, 54, the sister of Dr Pillai's wife, said: 'This is unbelievable. Sharnika is a lovely girl. It is very sad what has happened but Chit is . the last person to take advantage of someone.' A . spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police said: 'We have investigated every . aspect of this inquiry.

"By . Andy Dolan . Gerald Sargent discovered he had won more than 120 times when he contacted National Savings and Insurance . Gerald Sargent thought he might be unluckier than most. While friends and family seemed to be regularly winning cash prizes on the Premium Bonds, his numbers had not come up for years. So the 80-year-old contacted National Savings and Investments (NS&I), which runs the scheme, and was staggered to discover that he had won 124 times over the past decade. He is now celebrating a Christmas windfall of £5,325 after the cheques were mailed – plus a 125th pay-out for £2,094.94 in compensation to make up for the interest he lost out on. Mr Sargent, who has four grandchildren, said yesterday that the happy ending to his story should serve as a lesson to other bond holders who could be sitting on a pot of unclaimed cash. ‘I rang to ask if they had lost me in the system,’ said the keen fisherman from Swadlincote, Derbyshire. ‘They initially found I had won 10 times this year but I hadn’t received any winnings. ‘Two hours later I got a call from the manager saying I had won more than 120 times. ‘When I took the cheques to the bank the cashier couldn’t believe it. He nearly blew up the machine trying to process them. ‘I just want to urge people – particularly those like me who have endured a long, dry spell – to check and see if they have won as it could be a nice Christmas. ‘I have to survive on pensions worth a combined £170-a-week and this money could have made a big difference to my life. ‘As it is, I’ve had to drop out of clubs I was involved in – such as diving and fishing. I just couldn’t afford the fuel costs of a 40-mile round-trip to the dive club, for instance, let alone trips to Holyhead or Grimsby to go sea fishing as much as I’d like.’ Mr Sargent said his first win on the Premium Bonds was a £5 prize in the late 1950s. ‘I nearly tore the envelope up, thinking it was a tax demand from the revenue’, he said. ‘It was only my mother telling me to have a look at what was inside first that stopped me.’ He . steadily built up his investment in bonds during a varied working life . in which he spent 12 years as quartermaster on the Queen Mary passenger . liner, followed by stints in the merchant navy and as a supplier of . turf, before eventually settling down to run a wool shop in Swadlincote . with his former wife. The couple divorced after the business closed in 1999, by which point Mr Sargent had amassed the maximum £20,000 premium bondholding allowed. When the limit was increased to £30,000 in 2003 – and the top prize raised to £1million – he gradually raised his holding to the new limit. His problems seem to have started the following year, when an NS&I letter to him was returned as ‘undeliverable’ by Royal Mail. NS&I told the Daily Mail that, while it was still investigating what happened, usually in such a situation it would assume that the customer had moved house and wait for him to contact them, which happened only this September. A spokesman apologised for the delay in getting Mr Sargent’s winnings to him.","Gerald Sargent won £5,325 over ten years without knowing it .

"By . Andy Dolan . and Amanda Williams . Two former lovers who each murdered children in separate slayings are back in contact and writing love letters to each other from behind bars, it has been revealed. Wesley Williams strangled his former partner and her seven-month-old baby after the graduate broke up with him – then wrote about his crimes on Facebook. At the time of his sickening attack, in June, his ex partner Rebecca Shuttleworth was also facing trial for the murder of her two-year-old son Keanu. Wesley Williams, 28, (left) has been jailed for life for the double murder of his girlfriend Yvonne. He and his ex partner Rebecca Shuttleworth (right), who killed her two-year-old son Keanu, now write love letters from prison . Double murder: Yvonne Walsh, pictured with seven-month-old Harrison, had split up with Williams just two days before he killed her and her son . It has today been revealed that the couple are still 'obsessed' with each other and are penning love notes from their prison cells. The Sun reports that friends of Williams said he knew Shuttleworth had 'always been the one for him' since they met as youngsters in children's homes. Williams was ordered to serve a minimum of 29 years of a life sentence for the ‘chilling, casual and calculated’ killings of Yvonne Walsh and her son Harrison. Described by a judge yesterday as ‘clearly evil’, Williams posted a message on the social networking site after he carried out the double murder saying: ‘Sometimes we just have to do things we shouldn’t.’ He also wrote ‘I am sorry it had to come to this’ on his victim’s Facebook page, and changed his relationship status  to ‘single’. Mr Justice MacDuff branded the 29-year-old as a man ‘dangerous beyond measure’ who had ‘executed’ a defenceless infant and his mother. He then ordered guards to ‘take this evil man down’. Prosecutors said the pair’s relationship crumbled after 25-year- old Miss Walsh spurned Williams’s proposal of marriage. Williams used a ligature to carry out the 'chilling, casual and calculated' killings of Yvonne and Harrison Walsh . He had been released from prison on licence four months before the murders after serving a five-year term for attacking his sister’s ex-partner with a hammer. But the licence had expired by the time he killed the mother and son. Williams pleaded guilty last week at Birmingham Crown Court to murdering the pair. After his sentencing yesterday, reporting restrictions barring any mention of his link with his former girlfriend who murdered her two-year-old son were lifted. Rebecca Shuttleworth, 25, was jailed for life in June at the same court after battering to death her son Keanu Williams, under the noses of Birmingham social workers. Keanu Williams, whose body showed 37 external marks of injury, was found dead in January 2011 . She had given the child her then boyfriend’s surname even though he was not the biological father. Yesterday the court heard how Miss Walsh, a care home manager, was found dead in her bed at Billesley, two days after she was last seen alive. Her son’s body was found in his cot beside her. Pathologists were unable to determine who was killed first. The social care graduate’s relationship with Williams began two months before she died on May 31. She was last known to be alive at 8.10pm that evening – but by 8.54pm Williams was posting on Facebook. By then, police believe the mother and son were dead. Friends told police unemployed Williams was ‘joking, laughing  and smiling’ later that evening  as he played computer games. He was also caught on CCTV doing ‘high-fives’ with a friend in a fast-food outlet and boasted on Facebook of smoking cannabis later that night. Williams was arrested two days later at a flat in Oldbury, West Midlands after he sent police a text message confessing to the murders. It read: ‘I have killed my girlfriend. Her name is Yvonne Walsh and she’s upstairs in the bedroom.‘I’m not there, what should I do? You can’t phone me only text me.’ Rajiv Menon QC, defending, admitted there could be ‘no mitigation for these horrific and senseless murders’. Tragedy: Floral tributes placed outside the home of Yvonne Walsh in Chells Grove, Billesley, Birmingham, after she was found dead with her baby son . The judge told Williams: ‘The casual way in which you committed these killings was chilling. Your subsequent behaviour demonstrates how unconcerned you were at what you had done.’ Miss Walsh also had a three-year-old daughter from another relationship who was staying with her father when Williams struck. Williams’s mother, Christine Logan, 56, from Swansea, said she ‘felt sick’ when she found her son had been arrested. The mother-of-five said she had spoken to him that night after he left ‘worrying’ messages on Facebook. ‘I said to him, “What have you done now?” He replied, “Nothing, just smoking weed”. I said, “OK, have a good night.” He said, “I will”.’","Wesley Williams, 29, jailed for life with a minimum of 29 years .

"By . Andy Dolan . Mrs Justice Parker at the Court of Protection described the 'grossly cruel' ordeal of the woman who has a reading age of seven . A British woman with serious learning difficulties married a Pakistani immigrant and had his baby as part of a plan to help him remain in the UK, a secret court heard. The 37-year-old woman – who has a reading age of a child of seven – was even slapped around the face by her mother to force her to smile for the wedding photograph. On the day the couple attended a register office to give notice to marry, an anonymous caller rang the office to allege that her parents had been paid £20,000 to marry off their daughter to the Muslim student. Incredibly, although registrars were concerned about the ‘demeanour and vulnerability’ of the bride and feared she was being ‘manipulated’ as part of a visa scam, the civil marriage went ahead two months later. By then, the woman was pregnant and she went on give birth to a boy. Her 33-year-old husband, from Lahore, is now using his human right to a family life to try to stay in the UK, and lawyers expect him to be granted indefinite leave to remain. The case was heard earlier this year by the Court of Protection, which has the power to make life-or-death decisions on behalf of people deemed to lack mental capacity. It emerged with the publication of an ‘anonymised’ judgment. In her ruling, Mrs Justice Parker said: ‘I think there is a very significant possibility that this marriage was entered into, and indeed this child created, for reasons solely to do with immigration status. ‘To inflict pregnancy and childbearing on a person who cannot consent to that state is about as gross a physical interference as can be imagined. 'To put an incapacitated person in a position whereby she bears a child which she cannot look after is grossly cruel.’ The husband’s two-year student visa expired in September 2011. An application for further leave to remain was refused, so he lodged an appeal. 'As gross a physical interference as can be imagined' - Mrs Justice Parker . The woman, a Sikh who has converted to Islam, is said to have conceived ‘almost immediately’ after their Muslim wedding that November. The next month they met registrars about their civil wedding. The registrars contacted the UK Border Agency, describing her as ‘obviously learning disabled’. She was not sure of her husband’s name and could not remember being twice married and divorced – to a nephew of her stepfather and a maternal cousin respectively. UKBA informed social services, who objected to the wedding, but it went ahead. A senior registrar was ‘concerned about being seen not to have taken into account the cultural background and [the woman’s] right to marry and found a family, said Mrs Justice Parker. The court heard how the woman became pregnant almost immediately after getting married. File image . The child was made the subject of care proceedings after his birth and placed in foster care, with parental contact. According to the judgment, the woman has a reading age of 7.7 years and a learning disability. It said social services assessment shows she cannot look after her baby safely. The groom said he was ‘duped’ into marrying the woman by her parents, but now accepts that any ‘pretence that this is or could be a functioning marriage has now evaporated’. He told the court he wants to be rehoused with the baby in a two-bedroom flat, with social workers visiting for two hours every morning and evening so he can ‘go to the mosque’. After the judge’s ruling that the woman could not consent to sex, marriage or where she lived, the husband and the baby are likely to be rehoused separately by the council. He is now thinking of having the marriage annulled. John Hemming, the Lib Dem MP who campaigns to open up family courts, said: ‘One or more criminal offences have been committed and the registrars or immigration authorities should have reported it to police.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","The woman was forced to marry Pakistani immigrant and have his baby .

"By . Andy Dolan . Judge David Fletcher spared three brothers from jail after they admitted to wounding two men, telling them: 'Call me Santa Claus' A judge spared three brothers from jail then told them: ‘Call me Santa Claus’. The  trio had admitted wounding two men in a fight over the installation of a safety fence at  a building site. Despite their previous convictions for violence, the siblings were shown goodwill by Judge David Fletcher who handed down suspended jail terms so they could be with their families for Christmas. As they left the court to celebrate, Judge Fletcher told them: ‘Call me Santa Claus because you have been very lucky.’ Last night campaigners criticised the judge for favouring criminals over their victims. Adam Fouracre, of the charity Stand Against Violence, said: ‘It shouldn’t matter what time of the year it is – the crime is still the same. If people are allowed to get away with offences like this, offenders will not learn their lesson.’ Mr Fouracre, who set up the charity after his brother, Lloyd, 17, was beaten to death in the street while walking home from a birthday party in 2005, added: ‘Locking people up is not always the answer, but a judge has to protect society and the law-abiding people within it. Prison is supposed to be a deterrent.’ Margaret Lockwood-Croft, a former chairman of the Victims’ Voice charity, said: ‘This is dreadful. The judge has done little  to punish those responsible,  while failing the victims at the same time.’ A court was told the brothers left their victims with extensive cuts to their faces, requiring stitches, after trouble flared as the two men tried to put up a safety fence. Prosecutor Phillip Beardwell said Craig Tomkinson and Daniel McGing had been working for a development company on a building site in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, when they were attacked after James Bowden arrived with a digger and demanded that the fencing was taken down. His brothers Ben and Jonathan then arrived and waded in to the dispute last February. Mr Beardwell told Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court: ‘Ben Bowden attacked Mr Tomkinson with his fists. James Bowden attacked Mr McGing. Jonathan Bowden joined in.’ James Bowden, 34, of Audley, Staffordshire, pleaded guilty to unlawfully wounding Mr McGing. Ben Bowden, 26, of Bignall End, and Jonathan Bowden, 30, of Silverdale, both in Staffordshire, admitted unlawfully wounding Mr Tomkinson. Simon Warlock, defending James and Jonathan Bowden, said: ‘Men in their 30s rolling around on a building site is not an attractive proposition. James went to sort it out, but tempers were lost on both sides. This is not just one person acting in a pretty immature  manner – the same might be said of all of them.’ He added: ‘James does digger work and there’s a family skip hire business. He has three children. It is Christmas and all three men are thinking of their children. ‘Jonathan has two children. He heard what happened and he was there out of loyalty.’ Elizabeth Power, defending Ben Bowden, told the court: ‘It was a very stupid act.’ Mr Beardwell told Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court: 'Ben Bowden attacked Mr Tomkinson with his fists. James Bowden attacked Mr McGing. Jonathan Bowden joined in' James and Ben Bowden were both sentenced to 15 months in prison suspended for 24 months. They were also ordered to carry out 240 hours of unpaid work and told to pay their victims £750. Jonathan Bowden was given a  12-month sentence, suspended for 18 months, with 240 hours’ unpaid work, and ordered to pay £750 compensation. Judge Fletcher told the brothers: ‘This ridiculous idea that you go together as brothers to sort  out problems with your fists is, frankly, pathetic. ‘This was about nothing but someone doing their job and putting up a fence.’","Trio, who have previous convictions for violence, had admitted wounding two men in a fight over the installation of a safety fence at a building site .

"By . Richard Spillett . Millions of Britons spend most of their lives eating the same seven 'safe meals', according to new research. A study found a lack of time and confidence plays havoc with the typical person's meal plans, meaning 60 per cent of us eat the same dishes week after week. One in four adults even cooks the same meal on the same day every week and has a strict rota in place. One in four Britons say they cook the same meals on the same night of every week, with Lasagne being one of the seven 'safe meals' people return to time and time again, research has shown . Of those, the typical adult has the same meal schedule in place for nearly four years. But around 13 per cent have eaten the same thing on the same days of the week for 10 years or more. The survey of the nation's eating habits also found one in five people say that if they haven't planned anything in advance they tend to fall back on a frozen pizza, egg and chips or a take-away. A spokesman for Old Jamaica Ginger Beer, who commissioned the research, said: 'This study shows we are really lacking imagination when it comes to experimenting with flavours. Monday: Spaghetti bolognese . Tuesday: Chilli Con Carne . Wednesday: Pork chops . Thursday: Lasagne . Friday: Casserole (pictured below) Saturday: Stir-fry . Sunday: Roast dinner . 'Eating the same meals week after week for years on end doesn't sound very appealing, although it's easy to see how we become stuck in a rut. 'Busy lives, long commutes and domestic chores all take their toll and this research shows many adults are falling back on a handful of safe meals and drinks rather than experimenting with new flavours and recipes.' The company is encouraging people to 'trial new flavours' and 'broaden their culinary horizons.' Their study found the main reason for a limited repertoire of meals is a lack of time, followed by the cost element of having to buy different ingredients for more lavish meals. Of the 2,000 adults polled - 27 per cent said they prefer to cook British meals rather than international dishes. But the study found one in ten Britons lie to their friends and family about the type of meals they prepare in a bid to make themselves sound more adventurous. And 28 per cent said they often struggle to join in with conversations their peers are having about exotic foods and drinks. Many people said they would like to cook more adventurously but felt constrained by lack of time and money .","More than half of people eat the same dishes over the course of a week .

"By . Richard Spillett . A driver pulled over when he saw title of Adele's song 'Fire' flash up on his dashboard and panicked . A worried driver pulled onto the hard shoulder of a motorway after seeing the word 'fire' flash up on a dashboard display - only to discover it was the title of the song playing on his car stereo. The mix-up, caused by the title of the hit song by Adele, is one of number of incidents highlighted in a safety campaign to stop people needlessly causing a hazard on Britain's roads. The Highways Agency, which is in charge of the UK's motorways, has revealed some of the most bizarre excuses for pulling over in a bid to remind people that it is illegal to stop on the hard shoulder unless in an emergency. On one occasion, traffic officers found two cars on the hard shoulder, with one driver halfway through his vehicle to the other. On another occasion, a couple were asked if they had broken down but replied that they were taking pictures of their newborn grandchild in their open-top sports car because it was 'a lovely day'. Other instances have included: . :: A motorist who parked up and fell asleep on the M6. :: A group of motorcyclists who parked on the hard shoulder on the M1 to review their route and have a drink. :: A mobile phone user who stopped at regular intervals to carry out signal tests on the hard shoulder. The agency said that between July and September 2013, a total of 2,062 drivers broke the law by stopping on the hard shoulder when there was no emergency.. It is also illegal to drive under a red X sign which is displayed when the lane ahead is closed. Highways Agency national enforcement co-ordinator Jamie Hassall said: 'Every day, millions of people use our motorways. 'Most of them use the hard shoulder correctly and don't ignore red Xs, but we are appealing to the few who put themselves, other road users and those working on motorways at risk. 'Where the hard shoulder is used as an additional traffic lane at peak times, you can only drive on it if there is a speed limit over it. When a red X is displayed over any lane, it's simple - don't drive on it.' Drivers are being reminded that stopping on hard shoulders is illegal unless done in an emergency.

"By . Richard Spillett . Police missed a series of chances to protect a woman from her estranged husband before he stabbed her to death at her hair salon, a damning report has found. Former policeman Ivan Esack knifed Natalie Esack up to 11 times in front of her shocked colleague because he could not cope with her having a new boyfriend. The blade of the eight-inch knife he used bent  under the ferocity of the savage attack at Esack Hair and Beauty in High Street, Ashford, Kent. Ivan Esack (left) stabbed his estranged wife, Natalie (right), after police missed opportunities to protect her . Following the stabbing in April 2012, Esack told her colleague: 'She deserved it, the bitch.' He was later jailed for life with a minimum term of 28 years. His trial heard that, in the period before the killing, Esack told his victim she was a 'dead woman walking' and menacing added: 'Tick tock, tick tock.' Now a Domestic Homicide Review (DHR) has found there were 'a number of missed opportunities' for authorities  to protect Mrs Esack. Kent Police could have first arrested the killer in October 2011 after Mrs Esack visited a police station to report unwanted contact from him after they split up, it found. The report said that, at the time, Esack constantly phoned her, made a threat to kill her and threatened to go to her brother's house where she was staying. Mrs Esack also told police that Esack invited her to join in a 'threesome' with a man he had started a sexual relationship with, it stated. But police only deemed the incident as 'medium risk' gave her 'advice on how to deal with domestic abuse', the review said. When police later visited Esack, he apologised for sending her the texts, but claimed she had provoked him and he was not arrested. Chilling CCTV images show Esack buying the knife with which he later attacked his estranged wife at her salon . Ivan Esack, 38, leaving the supermarket (left). Mrs Esack also told police that Esack invited her to join in a 'threesome' with a man he had started a sexual relationship with, the report stated . The review said that Kent Police could also have arrested Esack for sending malicious communications or issued him with an harassment warning. In February 2012, he turned up at the house where she was staying, carrying a knife and threatening to slit his throat. 'This should have resulted in further investigation into an offence of possession of an offensive weapon,' the report added. The final incident reported to Kent Police before her death came in March 2012 when Esack turned up at Mrs Esack's father's house and refused to leave. Reporting the incident, a friend also told a 999 phone operator that  Esack had, the previous day, visited Mrs Esack's workplace and throttled her until she lost consciousness. When police attended her father's property, Mrs Esack did not want to take any action against Esack. The knife used by Ivan Esack to attack his wife. The 8-inch blade bent under the ferocity of the attack . The officer said the control room had not passed him the information about the alleged earlier strangulation and he had not viewed his computer assisted despatch, the review noted. The report said: 'Had all the information been collated, the... risk assessment in March 2012 should have been graded ""high risk"".' The review said there was 'evidence of escalating abuse' in the six months before Mrs Esack's death and police should have investigated the incidents in March 2012 more fully. While Mrs Esack's death may not have been prevented, the report found, domestic violence experts should have devised a 'safety plan' for her. A series of recommendations were made in the review, including reminding officers to achieve 'a proper standard of investigation'. The review also praised some areas of the police's work, including highlighting how officers removed Esack's shotgun and licence in November 2011.","Former policeman sent estranged wife threatening texts before killing .

"By . Richard Spillett . A great-grandfather died three months after he was left 'traumatised' when he discovered a trusted carer had stolen from him. Patrick Murray was left shocked after CCTV cameras set up by his family caught carer Claire Louise O'Hara stealing from his room in Stainton Way Care Home in Coulby Newham, North Yorkshire. O'Hara, 37, has now been found guilty of theft after evidence, given by Mr Murray before his death, helped to convict her. 'Kind and funny' great-grandfather Patrick Murray was left shocked after a care home worker stole from him . Teesside Magistrates' Court heard cameras were installed by Mr Murray's relatives who suspected money was going missing. Prosecutor Lynne Roberts-Plowman said: 'Family noticed that money had been going missing. They spoke to the care home manager who agreed to allow CCTV to be placed facing his wardrobe.' The cameras captured footage of O'Hara entering Mr Murray's empty room and looking for the key to his safe, which she then opens and removes an item, believed to be a wallet. She slips something into her pocket before locking the safe and putting the key back. Claire Louise O'Hara has been found guilty of theft over the incident at Stainton Way Care Home in Coulby Newham, North Yorkshire . On the day of the theft, the anniversary of Mr Murray's wife's death, his daughter-in-law arrived at 11.30am to go for a day out, setting the CCTV running. It was later discovered that £40 was missing. O'Hara, of Thornaby, North Yorkshire claimed to police that Mr Murray had asked her to take the money to buy gifts for his twin baby great-grandchildren and that he suffered with memory problems. But in his statements, Mr Murray, who died on July 1, two days after his 80th birthday, said: 'I'm 79 years old. I get £30 a week wages, which is kept in my wallet in the safe in my room. 'I did not give Claire permission to take money. 'I'm very upset and disturbed as I thought she was a lovely lass. I'm finding it hard to describe how I'm feeling. 'The fact that someone who I liked could do this has made me feel traumatised.' O'Hara, who had worked at the home for eight years, repeated her claims that she had been told to take the money at her trial. Magistrates found O'Hara guilty of theft and adjourned sentence for reports. She was given unconditional bail. Speaking after the hearing, Mr Murray's daughter Christine Coulton said: 'He came to the care home after my mum Joan died - they were married for 58 years so that hit him hard and he was in a bad way. 'But he really picked up with the care he got and came through it. We have to say, we don't want people to tar the whole care home with the same brush. The care he received - even from Claire - was perfection. 'All these young girls looking after him, he was in his element. he liked it there. 'We chose Stainton Way because it appeared to be - and was proven to be - the best. I looked at a lot of homes. Mr Murray's daughter Christine Coulton and son Michael Murray said he was never the same after the theft . 'This theft occurred on the first anniversary of my mum's death - and Claire was well aware of the significance of that date.' She said Mr Murray, who was also father to sons Michael and Antony and had nine grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren, was a 'sociable chap' with a good sense of humour, but that he was 'never the same after this happened'. She added: 'I thought it was despicable how they tried to suggest he had forgotten he'd asked her to take the money. 'We're just glad justice has been done for dad - it doesn't even really matter what the sentence is.' Mr Murray's son Michael added: 'He was such a kind person. Even after everything, he started to worry about Claire - about how her family would cope if she went to jail.'","Patrick Murray died aged 80 earlier this month after theft at care home .

Glen Johnson has backed Liverpool to succeed this season despite selling Luis Suarez, having already proved that they can win without the mercurial Uruguay striker. After banking £75million from Suarez’s move to Barcelona, Liverpool have strengthened by spending close to £90m on Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Dejan Lovren, Emre Can, Lazar Markovic and Divock Origi. They are still in the market for another striker after Loic Remy’s move to Anfield from QPR collapsed, and remain in talks to sign Spanish defenders Alberto Moreno and Javier Manquillo from Sevilla and Atletico Madrid. VIDEO Scroll down for Brendan Rodgers: Liverpool will play the same without Luis Suarez . No problem: Glen Johnson (centre) has backed Liverpool to succeed without Luis Suarez this season . Big money move: Barcelona spent £75million on acquiring the Uruguayan striker after the World Cup . Liverpool were without Suarez at the end of the 2012-13 campaign and start of last season after he was banned for 10 games for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic. However, they won six of the matches and only lost once, and Johnson believes they can compensate for the loss of a striker who scored 31 goals last season. ‘It gets overlooked that we played the first six games of last season without Luis and made a fantastic start so we can clearly win without him,’ said the England defender. ‘Any team that loses a player like Luis is going to feel it. But we will carry on the way we do, creating chances. I think we were the team who created the most chances last season. We’ve signed some good strikers and I’m sure once they get a chance they will take it.’ Happy on their travels: Brendan Rodgers' Reds are currently away in America on a pre-season tour .

Liverpool fell agonisingly short in the title race, losing out to Manchester City on the last day of the season. The demands of Champions League football will make it even harder this time, and they also face City, Tottenham and Everton in the opening six games. But Johnson has seen enough on the club’s pre-season tour of the United States to be believe they will be challengers again. He added: ‘I think as long as we play the way we did and fight the way we did last season then I’m sure we’ll be happy, but it’s a results game and we want to fight for the title as much as the fans want us to be. ‘We were definitely fresher for not playing Europe last season. And the size of the squad we had last season we probably could not have coped with all the extra games. It was probably an advantage last year. We’re going to have a lot more games this season but hopefully we can keep everyone fit and keep fighting. ‘If you want to win the League, the start of every season is important whoever you play. At the end of the day, whoever you play you are fighting for three points. But we’ve got some big teams early on. Sometimes that can be a good thing, sometimes a bad thing. ‘We’ve been preparing regardless of who we are playing at the start of the season. Hopefully we will win those games, give us a good start and damage our rivals.’","La Liga side spent £75m on Suarez after this summer's World Cup .

And . unknown to him, he had been caught on cameras installed by police after . previous raids on Mrs Woodward’s flat, leading to his capture soon . afterwards. The chilling . footage was released yesterday after the pensioner was awarded £1,500 . for her ‘pluck and courage’ in confronting Reid, 51. She was nominated by the judge who jailed him for the break-in – the fifth time Reid had allegedly targeted her. Victim: Mrs Woodward was burgled by Reid five times within a year and had £900 stolen in total . Heading out: Reid casts an eye back at his victim as he prepares to walk out of the door with her handbag . Alarm: The thief started running out of the flat as soon as Mrs Woodward's burglar alarm went off . Mrs . Woodward, who suffers from severe arthritis in both knees, cannot bring . herself to watch the film of the April incident because ‘it made me . feel like I didn’t want to live any more’. ‘It . was very frightening to wake up knowing there was somebody in my house . but I was determined not to let him get away,’ she said. ‘I wanted to break his kneecaps with my walking stick so he couldn’t escape.’ The . retired supermarket worker added: ‘I thought I’d be able to get him but . he ran into my bedroom, jumped on to the bed and went straight out of . the window like a gymnast tackling a hobby horse.’ The divorcee, who has no children, called police who found Reid at a nearby retail park. Officers installed CCTV cameras at her home in Long Eaton, Derbyshire, after the property was repeatedly targeted last year. She lost £900 over five break-ins before officers identified Reid in footage of the final raid and arrested him. Sinister: Another angle of the cameras shows Reid looking around with Mrs Woodward, bottom left, asleep . Running: The habitual thief pictured at the moment the burglar alarm went off . Heading off: Reid turns his back to the camera which had been set up to find his identity . Two . cameras clearly captured the burglar rooting around the flat for 13 . minutes looking for valuables – at times just inches from the sleeping . pensioner. Mrs Woodward is first disturbed by the sound of Reid . unzipping her handbag but is only roused fully from her sleep when he . triggers the alarm at 12.50am. As . she moves towards her walking stick, Reid is seen disappearing into . another room before making his escape through the bedroom window. Reid, of Nottingham, was charged with all five break-ins but the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the first three charges. The . father of two was jailed in May after pleading guilty to the last two . break-ins, stealing £53 from the pensioner’s purse in March and £66 when . he returned to the flat the following month. Police told Mrs Woodward . that Reid had a history of offending going back years. She . said she felt ‘traumatised’ and ‘abused’ by the burglar, adding: ‘My . privacy has all gone. My main concern from now on is just to keep myself . alive, just to keep going.’ Judge John Gosling jailed Reid for four years and eight months for his ‘wicked and calculated offending’. He awarded Mrs Woodward £1,500 of the Derbyshire High Sheriff’s fund, which aims to improve quality of life for local residents. Detective . Constable Gill Richardson said: ‘It is particularly shocking in the . film how brazen Reid is, being just inches away from Margaret.’ Chase: Mrs Woodward woke up when the alarm went off and brandished a stick at the burglar . Horror: The pensioner says that she felt almost suicidal after her burglary ordeal .","Margaret Woodward, 68, was repeatedly burgled by Patrick Reid, 51 .

"By . Joe Bernstein . England goalkeeper Joe Hart faces a tough battle to keep his No. 1 spot at Manchester City next season. City boss Manuel Pellegrini sees £6milion summer signing Willy Caballero as providing real competition for Hart who was pictured last week partying in Las Vegas with international team-mate Jack Wilshere after England’s disastrous early exit from the World Cup. Pellegrini, who managed Caballero at La Liga side Malaga, is unconvinced by Hart’s kicking and judgement as he seeks a modern 'keeper sweeper' in the mould of Manuel Neuer. Challenge ahead: Joe Hart faces a battle with Willy Caballero for the goalkeeper spot at Manchester City . New by: Caballero signed for the Premier League champions in a £6million switch from Malaga . While Hart’s physical attributes are of huge benefit in ordinary Premier League games, they are not as important against top clubs or in the Champions League. Hart was dropped for two months last season after rushing from his goal to allow Fernando Torres to score a late winning goal for Chelsea against City. Significantly, Pellegrini was asked whether he could sign an English understudy to Hart following the departure of Costel Pantilimon to boost City’s homegrown quota. But the manager insisted he went overseas for 32-year-old Caballero knowing that a reliable goalkeeper is vital for City’s chances in Europe. They have failed to get past the round of 16 in the Champions League despite an investment of more than £1billion since 2008. Caballero helped Malaga reach the Champions League quarter-finals in 2013 in a team that also boasted Martin Demichelis. The Spaniards were only eliminated by an injury-time goal by eventual finalists Borussia Dortmund. Mr. Reliable: Caballero helped Malaga reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League back in 2013 . It will be interesting to see how Hart reacts to the first serious threat to his long-term place at City. He said in interviews last season that being left out by Pellegrini had been a kick up the backside.But the 27-year-old failed to impress at the World Cup and knows he can not afford to be on the sidelines for the majority of the season. For a quiet and undemonstrative man, Pellegrini has displayed an enormous amount of independence since succeeding Roberto Mancini at The Etihad and was rewarded by winning the Premier League and League Cup last season. He has resisted the long-term plan of the club’s former Barcelona executives Feran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain to duplicate the tactics of Pep Guardiola, who they still want to lure to The Etihad Stadium when he leaves Bayern Munich.

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . Celtic are poised to join the race to lure Ghana World Cup winger Christian Atsu from Chelsea for a loan spell. Parkhead boss Ronny Delia has confirmed that the Scottish champions are in the market for a wide man. And 22-year-old Atsu is wanted by a raft of clubs in England, Spain and Germany for a year-long loan deal after spending last season at Vitesse Arnhem in Holland. Top star: Atsu impressed on the wing for Ghana at the World Cup in Brazil . West Ham United and Aston Villa are known to be interested in the left winger, with Hamburg and Espanyol also linked. But Celtic, who were linked with Atsu before he quit Porto for Stamford Bridge in a £5million deal last summer, hope the possibility of Champions League football could sway a player who started all three of Ghana’s World Cup games in Brazil. Atsu enjoyed a successful loan spell in Holland, scoring five goals in 28 appearances - but has ruled out a return to the Erevidisie this time round. Sought after: The young winger's performances have made him a loan target for a number of clubs . Celtic fly to Iceland this lunchtime ahead of tomorrow night’s Champions League qualifying first leg tie with KR Reykavik, Deila’s first competitive match in charge. The Icelandic club’s midfielder Atli Sigurjonsson admitted yesterday that his team mates have been so busy concentrating on playing Celtic that they have allowed their form to slump. KR Reykjavik were stunned by struggling Thor in their last game in the league before they face Deila’s side. And Sigurjonsson believes his side have been guilty of dwelling too much on their Scottish opponents ahead of the sell-out clash. Experience: Atsu spent last season on loan at Dutch side Vitesse and Celtic hope they can be his next club . He said: ‘Perhaps the thought of playing Celtic has been disrupting our form. ‘It will be fun to play Celtic and we are all looking forward to it. ‘I don’t think our form has been too bad - we just let ourselves down in our last game. ‘We are a good team and although we recognise it will be tough against Celtic, we are confident we can give an excellent account of ourselves against a team as big as them.’ Youngster: Ronny Delia is hoping he can convince the player Celtic once tried to sign to come to Glasgow .","Ronny Delia has confirmed the Bhoys are in the market for the wide man .

"By . John Greechan . and Stephen Mcgowan . Oscar Garcia declared his interest in replacing Neil Lennon at Celtic on Friday night and insisted he would achieve Champions League progress with a dash of Barcelona style. The former Barca player, whose sterling work within the famed La Masia youth system was followed by a title triumph for Maccabi Tel Aviv and a Premiership near miss with Brighton, has been added to the short-list drawn up in the wake of Lennon’s resignation. The 41-year-old, known at Celtic for the way his Barcelona Under-19s performed in home-and-away wins over their Scottish counterparts in the 2011 Next Generation Series, told Sportsmail: ‘For me it’s an honour to be linked to a club like Celtic. Up for the job: Oscar Garcia, who left Brighton after narrowly missing out on promotion, has put his name forward . European dream: Garcia (bottom right) tasted success at Barcelona, and wants European glory at Celtic . ‘They are one of the best and biggest clubs in Europe, so it’s great to have interest. Nobody from the club has spoken directly to me and you would have to ask them why they might be interested. ‘But I know what I can do, what I can achieve, how I want to play, what philosophy I would bring to them. I grew up with the Barcelona philosophy and I would try to play attractive football. ‘I would be confident of taking them into the Champions League. The big objective of a club like Celtic must be to get into the group stages – and then to find the right way to be better, to improve and to see where Celtic can go.’ As the runners and riders jostle for position in the race to takeover from Lennon, the sporting director of Henrik Larsson’s club Falkenbergs insisted the Parkhead legend was not in the running. Larsson is currently head coach at the Swedish Allsvanskan club and is the bookmakers’ favourite to succeed Lennon. But Hakan Nilsson insists Larsson has promised to honour his contract despite admitting he has been told of interest from an unnamed club. ‘Henrik told me there has been a club that wanted to talk to him,’ Nilsson told Sportsmail. Well-travelled: Garcia won the Israeli title with Maccabi Tel-Aviv before his time in the Championship at Brighton . Resignation: Lennon left his post at Celtic after winning his third consecutive SPL title this season . Club legend: Former striker Henrik Larsson is favourite for the job, but his current club say he is not available . ‘He is honest, we talk all the time and after that he said to me he is staying at Falkenbergs. ‘He has a contract for one year.  If the question of moving to Celtic is coming up then we have to look at it. We have to deal with it. ‘But it hasn’t come up. So for me it is nothing to worry about. ‘I would expect Celtic to do things professionally, of course. I believe Celtic is a very professional club and I have no concerns on that score. But we have a game tomorrow and that is all we are concerned about at the moment. I am not worried.’ Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell said: ‘There is nothing yet. It’s very, very early. ‘It’s very early to make any further comment, I’m sure you will understand. ‘We will take as much time as it needs to get the right candidate and we have got a wee bit of time so hopefully we will get it right.’ Lennon left yesterday for a trip to the Champions League final in Lisbon and was asked if Larsson was the man to succeed him. ‘You would need to ask Henrik that,’ Lennoin said. ‘If he does, then I am sure he will be a huge success – why not? ‘He had a great career as a player and is a very intelligent guy. He knows the game very, very well.’ Potential targets: Celtic are interested in Malky Mackay (left) but Roy Keane (right) has ruled himself out . Sportsmail has learned Celtic are also interested in Malky Mackay and the former Cardiff City manager will discuss the job with his ex-club if invited for talks. Owen Coyle, Jackie McNamara and Steve Clarke have also been heavily quoted, but Roy Keane has distanced himself from the job. The Republic of Ireland assistant manager is also an ITV pundit and quizzed on the matter yesterday said: ‘I’ve got a job - I’ve got two jobs - I can’t have another one. ‘Celtic are a brilliant club, an absolutely fantastic football club, one of the best in the world. But I have got a job.’ He added with a smile: ‘I’m not taking a pay cut for anybody.’ In with a shout: Both Owen Coyle (left) and Steve Clarke (right) have both been backed for the job . Currently preparing for a friendly with Turkey, Keane will fly to Lisbon on ITV duty for tonight’s Champions League final, but remains friendly with Dermot Desmond. ‘There’s always speculation when you are out of work or whatever. People might see this role as part-time or whatever, but it keeps me busy, I enjoy it. ‘I’m happy with what I’m doing and if somebody calls me, I will speak to Martin and the FAI and we will have a look at it. ‘But it’s all speculation, and obviously that speculation comes from yourselves. I don’t think you have heard it from any club sources.’","Former Brighton manager says he would get Celtic into Champions League .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . Ronny Deila revealed it was his ‘dream’ to march Celtic into the group stage of the Champions League as he became the club’s 18th manager on Friday. The 38-year-old’s position was confirmed following talks with major shareholder Dermot Desmond and chief executive Peter Lawwell earlier this week. Lawwell decribed Deila as a ‘good fit’ for the club’s transfer model after the Norwegian last season led unfashionable Stromsgodset to their first title in 43 years. But his first test comes within a matter of weeks as he attempts to lead the Scottish champions through the minefield of Champions League qualifying. Up for the challenge: Newly-appointed Celtic manager Ronny Deila speaks during a press conference . Smile for the cameras: Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell (left) unveils Deila as the new manager . An upbeat Delia appeared ready for the . challenge and said: ‘You can draw very good teams and you can be . unfortunate — because it’s a cup and that’s hard. ‘But . we need to have a good pre-season and take it from there. We know the . quality and the hunger in the squad to get to the Champions League. ‘When you get something, you want it even more next time. If we go out, then we go out and we have to work harder but I have a good feeling that we are going to succeed. ‘I am very proud today. It is a fantastic day for me. When I heard the name Celtic, I was interested right away. I felt in my stomach it was the right move. ‘It is a fantastic step and I think it is the right step. I feel comfortable. I feel like this is like a family. It is my dream to take Celtic into Europe and be in the Champions League. I really enjoy European football.’ Facing the media: Deila and Lawwell speak to journalists at a press conference at Celtic Park . New home: Deila makes his way into Celtic Park ahead of his first press conference as the club's manager . The . pictures of Deila stripping to his underwear after leading Stromsgodset . from the relegation mire have left the new man embarrassed. Indeed, he . said Celtic will have to win the Champions League before he repeats the . feat. ‘I am not so happy about that,’ he grinned. ‘I hope I am more fit now than I was then. ‘What . can I say? It was a bet between the fans and me in 2009. We lost the . old players because we didn’t have any money, so we had to play a young . team. ‘It was critical . point in the season and I said on television that if we stay up, I will . strip. We stayed up and the clothes went off but the pictures were not . so good. I wish they had got a better angle.’ Asked if there could be a repeat at Celtic, the new manager laughed: ‘We agreed that if we win the Champions League.’ Success: Deila coached Stromsgodset to their first Norwegian title in 43 years in 2013 . Big job: Deila (left) will replace Neil Lennon at Celtic after the Northern Irishman quit . Deila, . who has signed a 12-month rolling contract, confirmed former Celtic and . Scotland midfielder John Collins is one of three candidates he is . considering as his assistant. He . is keen to employ a Scot with a knowledge of the local game and will . also make the final call on Craig Gordon after the former Hearts and . Sunderland keeper had a Parkhead medical on Tuesday. As . Sportsmail first revealed, Deila had been considered by the Parkhead . club as a potential replacement for Johan Mjallby as Neil Lennon’s No 2. However, the Northern Irishman’s departure created a bigger vacancy . with Henrik Larsson, Roy Keane and Steve Clarke all interviewed for the . post before Deila prevailed. Lennon confirmed yesterday that Deila had been earmarked to be his assistant before he quit a fortnight ago. Backing: Predecessor Neil Lennon has backed Deila's credentials after he came highly recommended . The . former Parkhead manager has expressed disappointment Roy Keane pulled . out of the race, describing the Irishman as an ‘identikit’ Celtic . manager. But, offering his . reaction to Deila’s appointment, Lennon said: ‘He was going to be . brought in as No 2 when Johan Mjallby left. He came highly recommended - . he’s highly thought of. ‘I . know from contacts in the game that he is well respected as a coach. We . recruited Stefan Johansen from Stromsgodset, so we were aware of his . work.’ Addressing Lennon’s . claim that Deila had shot from a possible assistant manager to the main . man, Lawwell said at yesterday’s news conference: ‘Neil mentioned in an . interview today that when Johan (Mjallby) left we had a chat about Ronny . in terms of if he could play a role here. ‘When Neil decided to go and the process started two weeks ago, Ronny was at the top of the list to go and have a chat to. ‘There . were no job offers (to other candidates). We spoke to a lot of people . at different stages and got to different levels but no offer was made to . anyone else.’","The 38-year-old Norwegian has been confirmed as Neil Lennon's successor .

"By . John Greechan . and Stephen Mcgowan . Ronny Deila's former right-hand man has revealed how the new Celtic boss had talked himself into an instant promotion - moving from potential Parkhead backroom boy to No 1 contender for the top job. Lifting the lid on a process that saw the relatively unknown Stromsgodset manager handed control of the Champions League hopefuls, David Nielsen said his close friend and confidant would have been willing to work under a more high-profile head coach like Roy Keane. But Nielsen, former assistant and now interim successor to Deila, insisted that Celtic majority shareholder Dermot Desmond and chief executive Peter Lawwell had been completely won over in the space of a single interview - so much so that they put all their faith in a 38-year-old who has never worked outside of Norway. Promotion: David Nielsen believes Ronny Deila (above) talked himself into becoming the new Celtic boss . ‘He went in to interview for the assistant’s job and I think he would have taken it, because it’s such a big job,’ said Nielson. ‘But Ronny knew within his heart that he could do the top job. He went into the meeting and, when he came out, there was no more talk of him being an assistant manager. ‘He blew them away. The board knew that wasn’t an option – he was their man. That’s what happened.’ Deila is guaranteed a rousing send-off as he takes to the field for an emotional farewell at half-time during Monday’s home game against Kamper. Impressed: Stomsgodset FC assistant coach Nielsen claims Deila blew the Celtic board away . He’ll be back in Scotland by Tuesday, ready to start serious planning for Champions League qualifiers that could yet see his new team pitched against his former employers. Nielsen said: ‘We were on the bus back from our away game last Wednesday night and Ronny and I turned in our seats, looked into each other’s eyes. ‘He said: “You know we’re going to end up on the touchline against each other going for the Champions League”. And we burst out laughing. I think it will happen – it’s destiny. It’s great for us.’ Meanwhile, John Collins has edged closer to becoming Deila’s new No 2 after weekend talks in Glasgow. Local knowledge: John Collins is on the short list to become assistant manager at Celtic . As Sportsmail revealed last week, the former Celtic, Hibs and Scotland midfielder is favourite to become the Norwegian’s right-hand man following a meeting described by sources as ‘positive and productive’. However, Celtic chief executive Lawwell says the club are talking to ‘two or three’ candidates for the assistant’s post and Sportsmail understands Parkhead development coach John Kennedy is also firmly in the frame. Collins has yet to discuss financial terms and no deal is concluded as yet.","Stromsgodset assistant coach believes new Celtic boss Ronny Deila talked himself into the job .

"By . Pete Jenson . Follow @@petejenson . When former Barcelona B, Roma and Celta Vigo coach Luis Enrique begins work as Barca's new coach he will face the task of carrying out the biggest overhaul of the team since his pal Pep Guardiola took charge in 2008. The size of the job was made clear by the fact that the first player of the Luis Enrique era had already been signed before the man who played for Barcelona during the last eight seasons of his career had even been officially presented. Marc-Andre Ter Stegen’s arrival was announced at the same time as the new manager’s. The 22-year-old keeper signed from Borussia Monchengladbach will come in for Victor Valdes who joins Monaco. But the signings will not stop there. VIDEO Scroll down for Then and now: Luis Enrique new Barcelona manager . Big job: New Barcelona manager Luis Enrique must overhaul his squad after a disappointing season . New boy: Goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen has joined the Spanish club from Borussia Monchengladbach . Going nowhere: Lionel Messi has penned a new £16.3million-a-year deal to stay at Barca . Barcelona have also confirmed that Jose Pinto will cease to be reserve keeper. Messi’s great pal has shown in the run-in that he no longer has what it takes in times of emergency and the new manager will study a list of options that include Valencia’s Diego Alves, Levante’s Keylor Navas, Malaga’s Willy Caballero and Liverpool’s Pepe Reina. The latter two might end up at Atletico Madrid if, as expected, they lose Thibaut Courtois back to Chelsea. Dani Alves will join Valdes and Pinto in the cull. His move to Paris Saint-Germain is all but sealed and one of Luis Enrique’s most difficult jobs will be replacing the Brazilian right-back who arrived in 2008 coinciding with the greatest era in the club’s history. A new right back will definitely be needed because there is little belief in the B-team's Martin Montoya who may also be sold this summer. In the centre of defence there are even bigger problems. Carles Puyol is irreplaceable… but he will need replacing all the same. David Luiz certainly has the hair for it. He also has the chaotic, occasionally calamitous style that Puyol showed earlier in his career. Moving on: Dani Alves (centre) looks set to join French side Paris Saint-Germain this summer . Option: Enrique could make a move for Liverpool keeper Pepe Reina, who spent last season on loan at Napoli . Barcelona’s outgoing captain is very close pals with Luis Enrique so it may well be that the man himself advises on who Barcelona should bring in. Athletic Bilbao’s Aymeric Laporte and Real Sociedad’s Inigo Martinez are also being looked at as new recruits for the centre of a defence that conceded soft goals all season right down to that Diego Godin header that finally lost Barca the league. Vincent Kompany and Javi Martinez are the players Barça would really like to bring in but both have no intention of leaving their current clubs, no matter how much money Barcelona can find to throw their way. In midfield Alex Song was sold to Barcelona fans as someone who could play in the centre of defence or in midfield. The former was plainly never true and he has never been given the chance to demonstrate the latter. Luis Enrique is understood not to be a fan, preferring Rafinha who has already been recalled from his loan spell at Celta Vigo where he played under the new boss. Barca are also talking up interest in Paul Pogba though they accept Juventus are unlikely to sell. Toni Kroos is another target but Louis van Gaal might have other ideas. Luis Enrique is understood to be upset the club sold Thiago Alcantara – the brother of Rafinha – to Bayern Munich and will look for a similar option if he can find it from inside La Liga. Wanted man: Barca would love to sign Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany but a move looks unlikely . Target: Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba (right) is on Barcelona's summer wishlist . To fund the overhaul at least one big name player will have to be sold. Cesc Fabregas, Pedro and Alexis Sanchez are all available at the right price. None of them will leave for so much as a euro less than Barcelona want for them, and Fabregas’ suitors have already been told that it will take £45million to get him, and it’s also clear they won’t all leave. But for Barca to bring in as many players as they want to they will have to sell at least one top earner. Alexis is the most likely of the three to eventually move on. Cristian Tello, Adriano, Ibrahim Afellay and Isaac Cuenca will also be shown the door to make way for returning loanees such as Gerard Delofeu who returns to play for his former Barca B team boss. Everton could sign 18-year-old Adama Traore on loan to fill the gap, he is another Barca youngster who would benefit from Premier League experience. Return? The Spanish giants could decide to cash in on Cesc Fabregas, with Arsenal interested in the midfielder . Going home: Gerard Deulofeu (left) will return to Barcelona after spending last season on loan with Everton . It used to be that Plan A worked so well that there was no need for a Plan B but in meetings with sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta, Luis Enrique has already made it clear he wants a big centre-forward who can offer solutions when all else fails. Fernando Llorente has been discussed although as with Pogba Juventus would be reluctant to sell. The new manager will also sit down with Xavi and Javier Mascherano. Such is the huge respect for these two players they will only go if they decide to. Neither can be assured a first-team place in the new Barcelona and so if Xavi is tempted by an MLS adventure and Mascherano fancies Serie A or a Premier League swansong they will be allowed to move on. And when all the ins and outs are sorted Luis Enrique has the minor job or resurrecting Lionel Messi. He signed his £16.3m contract on Monday but the four-times Ballon d’Or winner has looked a shadow of his former self. It will be new man’s biggest challenge to make him shine again. Full name: Luis Enrique Martinez Garcia . Born: May 8, 1970 in Gijon Sporting Gijon. 1989-91: Came to the fore in his second season at Sporting Gijon and helped them qualify for the UEFA Cup Real Madrid. 1991-96: Failed to stand out playing a more defensive role at Real Madrid, had a lot more success on the wing and was a member of the 1995 La Liga title-winning side. Barcelona 1996-2004: A fundamental player in the Barcelona side that won the La Liga title in 1998 and 1999. Spain 1991-2002: Went to the 1994, 1998 and 2002 World Cups and won 62 caps.

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston has taken a swipe at Dundee United for going ‘public’ over his pursuit of Jackie McNamara. The Championship strugglers made an approach to the Scottish Cup finalists this week after deciding against the permanent appointment of caretaker boss Barry Ferguson, who it was confirmed on Friday has now left the club. However, in a statement on their official website, the Tannadice outfit announced they had rejected the overture and that McNamara was staying. Angry: Blackpool have blasted Dundee United for making their pursuit of manager Jackie McNamara public . That angered Oyston, who is under pressure from fans to get his next appointment right after a brush with relegation to League One, and he told Sportsmail his interest in McNamara is now over. ‘I’m always disappointed when any club makes public something which really should not be made public,’ he said. ‘I like to do things properly and sometimes you think that doing things properly is the single worst thing you can do in football. Because this is what happens. ‘The only way you can know if the manager of another club might be interested in joining you is by having a conversation with his club. ‘A conversation is not the same as a job offer. So it generally turns me off hugely if I cannot have a conversation with his club without that private conversation being made public. ‘So, in answer to your question, I have absolutely no interest in conducting a public pursuit in the manager of Dundee United.’ McNamara takes his team to Celtic Park tomorrow for the last league game of the campaign before returning there next Saturday for the final with St Johnstone. Secret's out: Blackpool supremo Karl Oyston was angered after Dundee United spilled the beans on their chase . He insisted nothing would get in the way of the countdown to the end-of-season showpiece and is already working on plans to make United an even bigger force next season. ‘Nothing has changed. We will just get ready for Sunday and then look forward to next week,’ he said. ‘There’s nothing really more to say about it. ‘I’ve been working with the chairman for the last few months preparing for next season. You have to be ready for different scenarios with players coming in, players out of contract . . . there’s speculation about others moving. ‘Last year, we lost a few key players like Johnny Russell, Jon Daly, Willo Flood and Barry Douglas so we have coped well and have brought good additions in. It will be the same every year.’ Staying power: Dundee winger Gary Mackay-Steven has been boosted by news that McNamara will not leave ahead of he Scottish Cup Final . Winger Gary Mackay-Steven said the news McNamara was staying was a major boost ahead of the cup final - and he insisted McNamara is destined for a bigger job in future once he has taken United to the next level. ‘It’s a great boost for everyone, he’s come in and been a breath of fresh air,’ said Mackay-Steven. ‘If anyone is linked with another job it’s always a good thing. It shows he’s doing something right. ‘When he gets more experience himself he’s destined for the top in the managerial sense. He’s still young and his chance will come. He has made the transition from player to manager and I think he’ll take this club forward a lot more. ‘The manager has shown he’s happy here and the players are happy - and it shows on the park.’","Blackpool have ended their interest in Dundee United boss Jackie McNamara .

"By . Mia De Graaf . and Stephen Mcgowan . An investigation has been launched into tomorrow's World Cup friendly between Scotland and Nigeria over claims of attempted match-fixing. The National Crime Agency has been in talks with both FIFA and the Scottish Football Association (SFA) after receiving intelligence of potential bids to rig the game. The game to be played on Wednesday at Fulham's Craven Cottage ground in London is part of a string of warm-up matches ahead of the tournament in Brazil next month. Warning: Police have issued a warning to FIFA of potential match-fixing at tomorrow's friendly clash between Scotland (squad pictured training) and Nigeria at Fulham's Craven Cottage ground in London . None of the World Cup-bound Nigeria players (pictured playing Italy at Craven Cottage last year) are thought to be involved in the potential scam . Confirming the probe, the SFA has revealed that it has been 'liaising' with police for three days after they were given a tip off concerning the clash. Believed to involve the Asian betting . market, there have been no specific indications as to whether the . attempted scam involves spot fixing or match outcome. There is no suggestion of players being involved in tomorrow's potential scam. SFA Chief executive Stewart Regan tonight stated that the governing body are taking the issue very seriously. He . said: ‘We have been liaising with the relevant authorities, the . National Crime Agency and FIFA, and we will be preparing for the match . as normal.’ The NCA, which investigates organized crime, and FIFA both declined to comment on the report. The Gambling Commission have already issued an alert to UK betting operators to be vigilant over irregular betting patterns in four friendlies taking place on Wednesday night – one of which is Nigeria v Scotland. The others are USA v Azerbaijan in San Francisco, South Korea’s game with Tunisia in Seoul, Denmark v Sweden in Copenhagen and Mexico v Israel in Mexico City. Scotland assistant manager Mark McGhee and the SFA have been warned to prevent a fix . The NCA take an interest in any intelligence from the Gambling Commission and have told FIFA that they have general information from the Asian betting markets suggesting a potential scam is afoot. They hope to stop the activities in their tracks by issuing an alert. A spokesman for the National Crime Agency said: ‘The NCA will, from time to time, provide operational detail necessary for public reassurance purposes. ‘It does not routinely confirm or deny the existence of specific operations or provide ongoing commentary on operational activity.’ The issue is returning to the fore with a number of World Cup warm-up matches now taking place, as they are expected to be targeted by match fixers acting on behalf of illegal betting syndicates in the Far East. There have been a series of arrests following suspected attempts to fix matches in the lower English football leagues in recent months. There have also been allegations of illicit activity in cricket. There is not believed to be a threat to Nigeria’s pre-World Cup warm up at Fulham’s Craven Cottage this evening.","National Crime Agency received tip off of potential fix at tomorrow's game .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . Scottt Brown insists he has no problem with the appointment of John Collins as Celtic’s new assistant manager. The Parkhead skipper was a member of the Hibs squad that staged a revolt against the former midfielder’s management methods during his short-lived tenure as Easter Road boss. Revealing that new boss Ronny Deila phoned him to break the news Collins was coming in, however, Brown claims there are now no issues between the two men. Happy: Scott Brown insists he doesn't have any issue with the appointment of John Collins as Celtic assistant boss . ‘I think there are always going to be negatives here and there,’ said the Celtic and Scotland skipper. ‘People are trying to start something up. ‘But you just have to focus on the positives. ‘It’s two good management people who have come in and that’s going to be good for us. ‘Ronny phoned me and told me who he was going to bring in. He said he was going to bring John in, so it’s been good. ‘I don’t dwell on what happened before. I’m at Celtic now, it’s a big club and John has come in. ‘Everyone wants to make it a big issue, but me and John have got on fine since he has come in. No problem: Brown claims he has been getting on well with the new assistant boss at Celtic . ‘There have been no hard feelings whatsoever and it’s been nothing but positive. ‘Hopefully that will continue because, the way it has been going, I have enjoyed every single minute of it.’ Unveiled as Deila’s right-hand man last week, Collins allayed any concerns over the relationship between the pair. A strong and influential figure in the Parkhead dressing room, Brown has matured since his days at Hibs and, in an interview with Celtic TV, says he always anticipated the possibility he might work with Collins again. ‘In football, it’s all about not falling out with people,’ he continued. ‘You always know that someone could come back round the corner in this game and you could be working with them again. No 2: Collins (left) helped take charge of pre-season training n Tuesday . ‘I always knew John might be back working at Celtic at some point because he is a legend here. There was always that possibility. ‘But the gaffer has done well to assemble a brilliant team with new faces and we start afresh. There is also big John Kennedy there on the coaching staff and he knows the club inside out and loves the club. ‘He has worked with the under-20s and under-19s and has been really positive in how he wants it to be done.’ Returning to pre-season training on Tuesday, Deila takes his squad to Austria for a training camp on Sunday. Communication: Brown revealed new boss Ronny Deila phoned him to inform the Celtic captain that Collin would be No 2 . The Norwegian needs a central defender, a striker and a wide man, but has no plans to add new signings until after the Champions League qualifying games with KR Reykjavik in mid-July. ‘The main thing is that the new manager gets a chance to see how we are building up and see how we are performing and gets a settled team formation,’ added Brown. ‘It’s only been one day we’ve been back so far but everyone looks in good shape. The lads are pros and keep themselves ticking over.’ Deila is also keen to hang on to his best players, with Fraser Forster and Virgil van Dijk tipped to leave if the Scottish champions receive strong bids. Spanish paper Estadio Deportivo claimed yesterday that Europa League winners Sevilla are interested in signing Dutch defender van Dijk, also linked with Ronald Koeman’s Southampton.","Scott Brown claims he has no issue with John Collins becoming Celtic's assistant manager .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . Mark McGhee fears the Scottish Premiership will be badly damaged by the absence of three of the nation’s largest clubs next season. And the Scotland assistant manager has also expressed concerns the national team’s progress could falter if Hearts, Rangers and Hibs fail to quickly return to the top flight. Addressing the radically changing landscape of Scottish football ahead of Tuesday night’s friendly international with Nigeria at Craven Cottage, the former Motherwell and Aberdeen boss admitted he never imagined a day when there would no Rangers nor Edinburgh clubs in the Premiership. Fear: Mark McGhee is scared the Scottish Premiership will be damaged by the absence of three of the nation's largest club's next season . ‘You have to say congratulations to Hamilton. They deserve all the credit for getting promoted and getting the result they did after losing the first leg. So you can’t take anything away from them,’ he said. ‘You can’t argue that they deserve to be there less than Hibs or anybody else. They’re there by merit. ‘But a league without Hibs, Hearts, Rangers? I could never have imagined that in my lifetime. ‘That’s a real shame because they are among the bigger clubs in the country and they benefit the league by being in it. The league loses something by them not being it, for sure.’ Rangers keeper Cammy Bell is the only player from Ibrox, Tynecastle or Easter Road currently in the Scotland squad who trained twice at QPR’s training ground on Monday. And McGhee fears that’s how it will remain until the three clubs can find a way back to health and start feeding the national team once more. ‘It shouldn’t impact in the sense that we’ve got a squad here that we think we can do well with,’ he said, ‘but there’s absolutely no doubt about it, Hearts, Hibs and Rangers are clubs of a stature that should just about be able produce players - and have players in their team - that would be in the international squad. ‘And they haven’t at the moment. That is a shame.’ Down and out: Hiberninan players look dejected during their play-off penalty shootout heartache . As Motherwell manager when Hamilton took barely 400 supporters to Lanarkshire derbies, the former Celtic striker harbours concerns about the overall spectacle of the game without three of the clubs with the most signficant average home attendances. ‘I think it’s huge. It’s one of the things that frustrates me. We spoke about this when we used to go to these meetings at Hampden when I was at Motherwell and Aberdeen. ‘We used to even ask why can’t they place the camera at Inverness where you  can see the crowd instead of the sea? ‘Try and give a backdrop to Scottish football. We used to talk about how teams like Inverness could go to Celtic Park and play brilliantly but the games weren’ t shown because they were at home. ‘So it’s all important, for the sake of the game, to promote it in a positive way.  It doesn’t always come across that way. ‘Now, without the names of Hibs, Hearts and Rangers in the division, I think it is lacking.’","Mark McGhee fears Scottish Premiership will be damaged by absence of Rangers, Hibernian and Hearts .

Veteran: Drogba has over 100 caps for the Ivory Coast and made over 200 league appearances for Chelsea . With Didier Drogba, the man whose penalty secured a first Champions League win for Chelsea in the clubs history returning to Stamford Bridge, we look at other frontmen who have returned to their former clubs. Those who have had a second coming have often enjoyed a hero’s welcome upon their return, but, on the pitch, were they hits or misses? Ian Rush (Liverpool 1980-87 & 1988-96)Having joined Liverpool from Chester as a youngster for £300,000 in May 1980, a British transfer record for a teenager at the time, it quickly became obvious that Rush was a prolific goal scorer. After six seasons and 168 goals, Rush made a surprise move to Juventus for £3.2 million. Just seven goals came in twenty nine appearances in Italy and, after his unrest became clear, Rush returned as a hero to Anfield. In his first campaign back at Liverpool, still officially on loan from Juventus, he blasted 30 league goals and went on to hit the net another 142 times in all competitions for the Reds.  Verdict: Hit Robbie Keane (Tottenham 2002-08 & 2009-11)The Irish striker always had the potential to play at the top level. Having impressed at Coventry and Leeds via the briefest of stints at Inter Milan, Keane made his mark as a natural goal scorer at White Hart Lane. 80 league goals came in his first six years in North London. Keane ultimately could never rekindle that success after an unsuccessful move to Liverpool in 2008 and returned to Spurs the following February. Despite 15 goals in all competitions upon his return, Keane was never quite the same player.Verdict: Miss Mark Hughes (Manchester United 1980-86 & 1988-95)Hughes was on the score sheet 37 times in the league for Manchester United, having risen through the club’s academy ranks. His form could not be replicated once he left for Barcelona and he suffered similar problems at Bayern Munich, to whom he was then loaned. Hughes returned to Old Trafford and won the PFA Player of the Year Award in his first season back in England (1988/89). Under the stewardship of Sir Alex Ferguson, he went on to score over 100 more goals for the club and cemented himself in its rich history.Verdict: Hit  Teddy Sheringham (Tottenham 1992-97 & 2001-03)Although Sheringham’s great trophy-winning days came at Manchester United between 1997 and 2001, he will always be remembered as a club legend by Spurs fans and players. He scored 99 goals in his first six years wearing the white of Tottenham and, after an extremely successful spell at Old Trafford, he returned to White Hart Lane to lift Tottenham fans from their seats another 26 times. He has since been inducted into their Hall of Fame.Verdict: Hit . Peter Crouch (Tottenham 1998-2000 & 2009-11)Another player to return to Tottenham was the familiar figure of Peter Crouch. He never played senior football for Spurs as a youth player, but returned over ten years later, for a fee reported to be around £9 million. Crouch had a mixed career at Spurs second time around, scoring 24 goals but also suffering two separate, three month long barren spells in front of goal. His hero status gained by scoring the winner against Manchester City in 2010, securing Spurs Champions League football was tarnished when he scored an own goal against the same opposition the following year. Spurs missed out on joining Europe’s elite on that occasion, with City qualifying.Verdict: Miss Thierry Henry (Arsenal 1999-2007 & 2012)The briefest of returns to Arsenal for the Frenchman. The fans wouldn’t have been bothered had he not scored at all after his 226 goals before he moved to Barcelona in 2007. Instead, the prolific striker bagged the winner on his second ‘debut.’ Arsenal later unveiled a statue for Henry, who emotionally accepted the gesture outside the Emirates Stadium, with the club colours draped around his neck.Verdict: Hit .","Didier Drogba returns to Chelsea .

The TV duo released changes to kick-off times for every weekend up until the end of November on Monday, leaving many travelling supporters frustrated. A large minority of the changes leave it impossible for fans of the away side travelling on the train to either get to the host town or city in time for an early kick-off, or get home after an evening game. Loyal: Newcastle fans will have to find an alternative way to get home from their game at Stoke in September . Away days: Chelsea fans are among those inconvenienced .

Mon 03: Crystal Palace v Sunderland (8pm)Mon 24: Aston Villa v Southampton (8pm)Sat 29: Sunderland v Chelsea (5.30pm) The opening round of fixtures sees Chelsea travel up to Burnley for the Monday night 8pm kick-off – with travelling fans unable to get home the same night. Southampton fans will also struggle to see Ronald Koeman’s first game managing their side in the Premier League, with the earliest train from the south coast making it into Liverpool Lime Street just minutes before kick-off at Anfield on Sunday August 17. Monday night matches are the worst culprits in the revised list, with five of the seven announced fixtures leaving train-travelling fans stranded in the host city, including Hull City vs West Ham on September 15 and Crystal Palace vs Sunderland on November 3. August is the worst month for travelling supporters, with five games leaving away fans needing other arrangements, including London-based supporters of Arsenal and Chelsea playing at Everton in the Saturday 5.30 kick-off on consecutive weekends. Difficulties: Chelsea fans will face travel difficulties for games at Burnley, Everton and Sunderland . The last train from Merseyside to the capital leaves mid-way through the second half of those fixtures. Chelsea’s travelling contingent have it worst with three of their matches being late kick-offs at Burnley, Everton and Sunderland, while Southampton and Newcastle fans will be struggling for two games. Last season the Premier League allocated £250,000 to every club to put towards an away fan initiative to help ease these problems. Clubs like Stoke and Fulham put on free coach travel for fans, while Chelsea chartered special trains for night games at the two Manchester clubs. A host of other clubs such as Liverpool used the money to subsidise ticket costs. New boss: Saints fans wishing to catch Ronald Koeman's debut will not be able to take the train . Celebrations: But Arsenal fans might find their route home from Everton blocked by problems with trains . A spokesperson for the Football Supporters’ Federation said: ‘Match-going fans come too far down the list of priorities when matches are selected for TV. Every season there are examples of games being moved to times which are extremely difficult for travelling fans. ‘To pick an example at random on the season’s opening weekend, how are Southampton fans going to get to Liverpool for a game on Sunday at 1.30pm? ‘TV companies often get the blame but let’s not forget that it’s the clubs themselves who allow this to happen by agreeing to contractual terms which inconvenience their own fans. ‘That’s not to say BT and Sky couldn’t lighten the load on fans. The FSF has received many complaints from fans unhappy at the four weeks it took both companies to announce which games would be moved for broadcast. ‘Every day of silence from them cost fans time and money. Train fares go up, hotel rooms are sold out, and it’s more of a struggle to book days off work. Supporters want to see both BT and Sky move a lot quicker next season.’ Complaint: The Football Supporters' Federation say Sky and BT Sport could lighten the load on fans .

"By . Charlie Skillen . Follow @@charlieskillen . While fans around the world were glued to their screens to watch the Champions League final – not to mention 65,000 packed into the Estadio do Luz, I had a day with a difference. I flew out to Ibiza to the Heineken Star Final, and watched the game with Real Madrid hero Fernando Morientes and former Atletico star Luis Garcia. Legends on either side of the Madrid divide, the two former Champions League-winners were bound to have different takes on the Lisbon showpiece. All smiles: Sportsmail caught up with Fernando Morientes (left) and Luis Garcia (right) in Ibiza during last week's Champions League final . After appearing the night before at a beach dinner for hundreds of competition winners, Garcia and Morientes showed off their skills by shooting into a floating goal in the Mediterranean, aided by some truly impressive jetskiing skills. After proving that I’m better off writing about football than playing it with a spot of beach soccer, I caught up with the two stars to gauge their nerves before the game. Morientes was predictably hell-bent on Real securing the famous ‘La Decima’ – their tenth European Cup – while Garcia was quietly confident Atletico could do the double over their illustrious neighbours by following up winning La Liga in spectacular fashion and winning the Champions League. Former striker Morientes left you under no illusion who he thought the bigger team was, saying: 'La Decima is not life or death, but it's the most important thing for the club, the city and the supporters. 'It's the biggest competition in Europe and Real Madrid are the most important club in the world, so it's a necessity. Big match: Former Madrid striker Morientes and ex-Atletico frontman Garcia answered questions as Real finally achieved La Decima . 'Ancelotti . will play the same way he has done all season. A team like Real Madrid . doesn't have to change their strategy because of the opposition.’ Garcia, . meanwhile, was a little less bullish, but believed the pressure was all . on Carlo Ancelotti’s side, while revealing he would love to know . Atletico boss Diego Simeone’s secret formula. 'I would like to be inside the dressing room to know how he's handled everything,’ he said. ‘It's been very difficult fighting against Real and Barcelona and Atletico was always there. He's done an amazing job. 'Man to man Real Madrid is stronger, but that's not the most important thing in a final. Everyone knows how important the 10th European cup is to Real Madrid so Atletico know if they win they can be at the top for a few years.' Back of the net: The two Madrid legends warm up at the Heineken Ibiza Final . After a healthy dose of after-sun in the hotel, I went to the cinema-style open-air viewing for the match, where excitement to watch the final was already reaching fever pitch. Morientes and Garcia smiled and waved on stage to the audience, before settling in to their main task for the evening – answering fans’ questions on Twitter throughout the match, including some from Sportsmail. I spoke to both of the players before, during and after the game, with one much happier as time progressed than his counterpart. Throughout the ninety minutes Morientes looked glum, in stark comparision to his fellow ex-Kopite Garcia – sure of seeing his former side complete the ultimate double over their arch nemesis. Question time: The duo claimed Iker Casillas was experienced while Thibaut Courtois was very talented . That all changed with Sergio Ramos’ goal deep into added time. Morientes jumped up, knowing that Ancelotti’s side had grasped the chance of a glorious win from the jaws defeat. Extra-time was horrifically cruel to Atletico, who had been superb throughout normal time. Gareth Bale, Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo put the score at a truly unfair 4-1. With Morientes still celebrating, I managed to grab a few words with the despondent Garcia. He said: ‘Atletico did a great job, but because they made a mistake they got punished – that’s what Real Madrid do. In the end it was a bit unfair, but that’s football. ‘Atletico deserved to win. They played the same as they have done all season, keeping Real away from the goal, and it worked for 90 minutes – but you can’t make those mistakes. ‘Simeone has to be immensely proud of the whole season.’ While Garcia contemplated the loss and Morientes grinned away watching his club finally lifting ‘La Decima’, I was whisked off to the neighbouring Usuhaia opening party.

Armitstead (Boels-Dolmans) attacked at the start of the last of 13 laps of the 89-kilometre race, but was edged into the safety barrier inside the final kilometre by Annemiek van Vleuten, one of Vos' team-mates. An aggressive race which featured numerous attempts to avoid a bunch sprint finished with the pack tearing down the Champs-Elysees and Vos (Rabo-Liv) dug deep to hold off fellow Dutchwoman Kirsten Wild (Giant-Shimano). Armitstead (Boels-Dolmans), the Olympic silver medallist behind Vos on The Mall two summers ago, picked herself up to finish more than three minutes behind, in 94th place, nursing a bloody elbow and battered pride. Lizzie Armitstead crashed in Paris as Marianne Vos won the race . Dutch of class: Olympic champion Marianne Vos celebrates after winning the La Course race in Paris . The 25-year-old from Otley, who required stitches but will be fine for next Sunday's Commonwealth Games road race in Glasgow, said: 'I had a bit of bad luck in the race. I dropped my chain two times so I had to change the bike two times. 'And then in the final I was a little bit out of position but I was pretty okay because I was on Vos' wheel so I wasn't too panicked. 'But her team-mate just put me in the barrier, Annemiek van Vleuten. She turned right on me and took her team-mate down as well (the French champion Pauline Ferrand Prevot).' The race took place on the final day of the 101st Tour de France, which began in Leeds on July 5, and was an opportunity for women's cycling to showcase itself on cycling's most famous road finishing circuit. 'I wanted to put on a show and maybe it was a bit silly but I'm not an out and out sprinter,"" Armitstead said of her foiled attack. 'Today it was really special for me because obviously the Tour started in Yorkshire and I heard lots of chants of 'Yorkshire' as I was riding around today. Marianne Vos crosses the line to win the La Course in Paris . 'Just to be riding around Paris is not something I ever expected to experience. 'It just made me proud of where women's cycling is at the moment.' Emma Pooley was proud, too, as one of four women - alongside Vos, American Kathryn Bertine and former triathlete Chrissie Wellington, all part of Le Tour Entier campaign group - who petitioned Tour de France organisers Amaury Sports Organisation to put on a women's race. 'It was an amazing experience,' said Pooley (Lotto-Belisol), who was 84th in a race which did not suit her climbing ability. 'This race is just brilliant for women's cycling. I don't know how exciting it was to watch... better than pedalling around drinking bottles of champagne slowly.' That was a reference to the ceremonial finish to the men's race. Pooley hopes for further opportunities for women's cycling now. She said: 'I'd love to see more long women's stage races alongside the men's races, but at the moment it will take time to develop. Dutch rider Marianne Vos celebrates victory in the first ever La Course . 'That's not up to me. ASO don't have some kind of duty to put on women's races, they're a money-making organisation. 'If it's a success because of the audience and their response is because of the audience, then it will expand because it's a good financial proposition. 'It's a huge missed opportunity at the moment, financially. Think of the number of women who ride bikes nowadays.' Pooley will now ride Thursday's time-trial at the Commonwealth Games for England, a race from which Armitstead had already withdrawn to focus on Sunday's road race over the circuit on which she won the 2013 British title. Armitstead, who also had a sore shoulder, added: 'I'll be fine, it's just a nuisance.

Campbell, a former Olympic relay gold medallist and Sydney 2000 runner-up over 200 metres, believes the emergence of English ace Gemili, a struggling footballer who found his true talent was in athletics, has shaken up the domestic scene.
