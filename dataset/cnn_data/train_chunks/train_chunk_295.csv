"(CNN) -- Perhaps Tim Meadows' invitation back to ""Saturday Night Live"" got lost in the mail. The actor, who appeared on ""SNL"" from 1991 to 2000, initially seemed upset to see the show bring back its Bill Brasky sketch without him on Saturday. Written by ""SNL"" alums Will Ferrell and Adam McKay, the sketch revolved around guys recalling the daring feats of legendary businessman Bill Brasky. At the heart of it was Ferrell who, with teeth too large and a drunken slur, would join his compatriots in toasting Brasky's awesomeness. With Ferrell back on the show Saturday, ""SNL"" resurrected the sketch and tapped his ""Anchorman 2"" co-stars David Koechner and Paul Rudd, host of the night's episode, to join him. Most viewers were probably thrilled to see the sketch return, but Meadows apparently was shocked. ""They did Brasky without me ... ,"" he posted on his Facebook page. ""Not even a 'hey would you want to come to do one line and bring your kids to see (One Direction)...?' Nothing ... Wow ... I guess I know my place."" Meadows said he's ""grateful for what they did for me"" but it ""stings a little to not even be considered as someone they would like to come back around. ... Sorry ('The Ladies Man') bombed. ... (I)f it would have done better they wouldn't treat me like a red-headed stepchild."" Other Brasky sketch regulars from the old days, such as Alec Baldwin and John Goodman, were also missing in action, and Meadows suggested the bit appeared to double as an ""Anchorman 2"" promo. ""I'm sure it's economics and budget,"" he said Sunday morning. ""I'm not in 'Anchorman' and I'm not promoting a show so who would want to pay for me to fly to NYC. I'm nobody."" Later, after encouraging words from fans (""The Ladies Man"" may not have done well at the box office, but at least one person considers the 2000 movie a classic) and learning the sketch was a last-minute deal, Meadows seemed to have made peace with being left out. ""Thanks everyone for all your kind comments. I'm not mad at the show,"" he shared. ""I know what it takes to produce those sketches in a short amount of time. I talked to a friend on the show who said it WAS a last-minute sketch. I acted like a baby. I'm happy for all of my friends' success and will always be grateful and proud to have been a part of 'SNL.' That being said don't forget to see 'Anchorman 2' coming soon to a (theater) near you.""

"(CNN) -- It's ""very likely"" that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's powerful uncle, Jang Sung-taek, has been removed from his top-level position in government, two South Korean lawmakers said Tuesday, citing a briefing from their country's intelligence service. And two close allies of Jang -- Lee Yong-ha and Jang Soo-kee -- have been publicly executed, one of the South Korean lawmakers said at a news conference. The lawmakers, including Cho Won-jin of the governing Saenuri Party, said this after receiving what they said was a briefing from South Korea's National Intelligence Service. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the report. Jang Sung-taek was the brother-in-law of North Korea's previous ruler, Kim's father, Kim Jong Il. When the elder Kim died and the son succeeded him, analysts told CNN that Jang would be a power behind the throne as the younger Kim took control of the reclusive nation. Jang was the vice chairman of North Korea's top military body and has often been pictured beside Kim. His removal would mark a major upheaval in North Korea's leadership since Kim succeeded his father, who died in in 2011. Some have said he may have been at the heart of an internal palace struggle, one which might have put him even at odds with his own wife, Kim Kyong Hui, according to a Time magazine report two years ago. ""If this is in fact true, the implications are pretty profound,"" said John Park, a Northeast Asia analyst at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. ""Some see this as perhaps the last part of the power consolidation phase, that Kim Jong Un has in fact removed all of the old guard close to his father and is now finalizing the inserting of his own inner group,"" Park told CNN. But he said Jang ""was seen as a force of stability"" by China, North Korea's leading ally. ""I think there will be a lot of concern in Beijing right now,"" Park said. Jang cultivated extensive business ties with China, so his removal ""also has implications in terms of making money for the regime."" But he said other analysts suspect Jang, who had fallen from favor several years ago for building his own patronage network, may have been caught trying to rebuild that system, resulting in his ouster. It has previously been reported that Kim Il Sung -- father of Kim Jong Il and architect of the North Korean state -- disapproved of Jang's marriage into the family, according to Time. North Korea, a state shrouded in secrecy, is involved in a protracted standoff with its neighbors and Western powers over its nuclear weapons program. Tensions between North and South Korea soared this year as Pyongyang reacted angrily to tightened United Nations sanctions imposed in response to its latest nuclear test. The two sides are still technically at war after the 1950-1953 Korean War ended in a mere truce, not a treaty. CNN's Judy Kwon in Hong Kong, Matt Smith in Atlanta and journalist Yoonjung Seo in Seoul contributed to this report.","Kim Jong Un may have cemented his power by removing his uncle, analyst says .

"(CNN) -- Reading the legal complaint leaves a heavy feeling in the pit of your stomach. The claim, filed by attorney Gregory Owen on behalf of one child, alleges 4- and 5-year-olds at the First Lutheran Child Development Center in Carson, California, were performing oral sex on each other at the preschool. The suit alleges that in addition to acts performed on the 5-year-old plaintiff, other students were removing their clothing and engaging in sexual acts on the playground and during nap time. Such behavior, experts say, would be rooted in normal childhood development; the children participating in or seeing such sexual acts may not fully understand what is taking place. Whether such alleged inappropriate acts will have a long-term impact on students depends on how the situation is handled, experts say. ""Young children are not developmentally prepared to engage in sex,"" said Kathryn Seifert, an expert in youth violence and sexual behavior. ""Their brains are not ready to absorb that kind of information."" Owen told CNN he is representing six children who attended the church's program and their parents. He plans to file five additional lawsuits before the end of February. The first, filed Tuesday, names the school, several of the First Lutheran Church of Carson's leaders, an unnamed ""minor perpetrator"" and the perpetrator's parents as defendants. The suit said that the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services conducted an evaluation of the center in November and found a lack of supervision, which ""allowed for inappropriate touching between minor students."" In a statement, First Lutheran officials said the incident referenced in the lawsuit happened in October and was ""addressed and dealt with"" at that time. The statement notes that the plaintiff was still enrolled in the church's preschool until last week. Kids at risk: Say something or bite your tongue? Michael Weston, spokesman for the California Department of Social Services, told CNN the department met with officials from the church on February 1 concerning ""noncompliance"" license violations against the school over the past six months. The violations discussed included a lack of supervision at the care facility, child-teacher ratios and inappropriate discipline. At that meeting, Weston said, the department was informed that the school's director was resigning and the school license would be set to inactive on Friday. The decision to close the school was made based on the director's resignation, which was for personal reasons and not related to the incidents, according to the church officials' statement. On Wednesday, the California Department of Social Services issued a temporary suspension order to the development center after determining there was an ""immediate risk to the children in care."" The order prohibits the facility from operating, according to a letter from the department. Weston said the department will continue to investigate after the school closes. Questions remain, Seifert said, about what exactly happened at the school: Was this a group of unsupervised children just being curious about their bodies? Were they copying something they had seen on TV or in a magazine at home? Was it the result of sexual abuse -- either by another student or an adult? Judith Myers-Walls, an expert in human developmental stages at Purdue University, said sexuality, in a sense, starts younger than you might think. Between the ages of 2 and 5, children learn to dress and undress themselves and begin to understand what it means to be a boy versus a girl. Many toddlers like to run around naked, Myers-Walls said, and may touch themselves. ""That is again, very normal. ... They're simply doing things that feel good, in the same way they might curl their hair,"" she said. ""They don't (know) social norms. They haven't learned what's polite and impolite until parents teach them."" Children are excellent imitators, Myers-Walls said. Often the actions they're exhibiting have been copied from somewhere else. Adults who come across children exploring their bodies in inappropriate ways should step in immediately and stop the behavior, she suggested. They should explain that the acts are not acceptable in public areas. Parents should teach their kids about ""private parts"" that need to be covered in public, she said, and about personal space. The way parents deal with the alleged situation in California will affect how much of a long-term impact it may have on the children, Seifert said. Getting upset or angry may convey to a child that he is in trouble and lead to anxiety surrounding his sexuality down the road. Instead, asking questions calmly about what happened and why should clear up whether the child has been traumatized by events. A professional therapist can help determine the extent of trauma and work with the family to recover, Seifert said. Even if the child doesn't know sexual activity is wrong, it can still have lingering effects. While some exploration is natural, sexual acts such as oral sex may ""make them feel odd or funny or sad or angry,"" she said. ""It's those emotions that have to be cared for."" The best way to avoid these kinds of situations is to have ongoing conversations about sexual behaviors with your kids, Myers-Walls said. ""It's important for parents to realize you don't have 'the talk' and you're done."" When children are around 2, parents can discuss body parts and the differences between boys and girls, she said. As children grow a bit older, parents can talk about private parts and when it's OK (and not OK) for kids to explore their bodies. In later years, kids will ask where babies come from; you don't have to talk about birth control and abortion, but you should answer their questions simply and directly, Myers-Walls said. ""(Sex) is very different than drugs and smoking -- you don't ever want them to do that,"" Myers-Walls said. ""Being a sexual being is who we are."" There are warning signs that your child is participating in inappropriate behavior or is being abused, Seifert said. Every day, parents should be talking to their children about their day: what happened, who they hung out with, what they did. If topics come up the child should have no knowledge about, calmly ask more questions, she suggested. Other signs include drastic changes in behavior, trouble sleeping, eating changes or anger issues, Seifert said. ""We want people to be aware so if they're in this situation they know what to do,"" she said. ""Even if it is something that's unfortunate that's happened to your child, there is help out there.""

"New York (CNN) -- A federal judge in New York sentenced three men to a minimum 25 years in prison on Wednesday for plotting to detonate bombs at two Bronx synagogues and attack a military base in New York. James Cromitie, Onta Williams and David Williams were arrested in 2009 after planting what they thought were live explosives. Laguerre Payen, a fourth member of the group who was arrested and tried together with the defendants, was not in the courtroom pending a psychological evaluation. In August, the jury spent six weeks listening to the testimony and undercover tapes from an FBI informant who posed as a Pakistani militant. After eight days of deliberations in October, the defendants were convicted on seven of eight counts, including conspiracy and attempts to use and acquire weapons of mass destruction and anti-aircraft missiles. Cromitie and Williams were also found guilty of attempting to kill officers and employees of the United States . In an emotional statement on Wednesday, Cromitie apologized to the people of United States, his family and friends. ""I have never been a terrorist and I never will be a terrorist and everyone here knows that,"" he said. David Williams and Onta Williams also apologized to their families and thanked supporters, and Onta apologized to the people of Riverdale. The prosecutors were pushing for life in prison for the three men. ""What these three defendants did was as serious a set of offenses as is imaginable,"" said Assistant U.S. Attorney David Raskin in court Wednesday. Members of the defense team argued during the trial that their clients were victims of entrapment.  The original sentencing was postponed from March 24 so the judge could hear defense arguments on the government's usage of a confidential informant in the case. ""The real crime in this case is that the government was allowed to do something like this,"" Suzanne Brody, attorney for Onta Williams, said after the sentencing.  Lawyers for the three men have said they will appeal. U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon admonished the defendants for what they tried to do, calling it ""beyond despicable,"" yet she handed down the minimum sentence, calling the defendants ""thugs for hire,"" not religious or political martyrs. She praised the ""brilliant lawyering"" in the case and the defense for dedication to their clients. ""James Cromitie, David Williams and Onta Williams voluntarily agreed to target synagogues and military planes using what they thought were real bombs and missiles,"" said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. ""Today's sentences ensure that the defendants will be punished for their actions.""","James Cromitie, Onta Williams and David Williams get minimum of 25 years .

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration likely will succumb to growing pressure to ""do something"" kinetic and dramatic in Iraq, and when it does, it will most likely be air and missile strikes against ISIS targets. This could relieve the political pressure on the President: His critics continue to blame him for abdicating U.S. leadership in Syria and in Iraq --which now faces the advancing extremist militants of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). But answering the political mail in Washington is not the same thing as dealing with, let alone resolving, the complex issues on the ground that have led to this crisis. To do that would require a comprehensive reengagement strategy, even without boots on the ground. And President Barack Obama should not be drawn into a veritable Iraq war III. Most of Obama's detractors engage in what I call ""woulda/coulda/shoulda"" criticism. That is to say, if the President had only invested more time and effort in negotiating a status of forces agreement with the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, left a residual presence there, enforced his chemical weapons red line in Syria and backed the moderate opposition there, we wouldn't be seeing the ISIS jihadi rampage playing out in both countries. But given the limited amount of intervention this administration, Congress, and the public would support, even under the best of circumstances, the U.S. could not have stopped the dynamic that is occurring. We cannot hold Iraq's hand forever, nor end Syria's civil war without a major military commitment. And the longer the Syrian conflict continued, the more of a boon the conflict would provide to jihadi elements who fed off its violence and sectarian character. As for Iraq, the al-Maliki government's insistence on maintaining Shia dominance and privilege, and repressing Sunnis, created the perfect ferment for ISIS's spread. No amount of U.S. military power summoned by any administration could have compensated for this kind of bad sectarian governance. That and the weak institutions of the Iraqi state have allowed ISIS to thrive. No matter how much progress the U.S. made in Iraq between 2003 and 2011, the dysfunction that now shapes Iraq's future was driven by factors set into motion by the very act of the invasion, Iraq's nature and its location. And those same factors limit now what the U.S. can do; they should make Washington wary of getting sucked back in. Back to Iraq: What can - and should - the U.S. do now? Maliki's sectarian dominance . How can you expect stability and security in a country where the political contract between the governed and those who govern is completely skewed in the direction of the Shia community? But that's what you have with Nuri al-Maliki; and that's unlikely to change. Shia repression has left Sunnis feeling disenfranchised -- one reason why violence has surged in the last year -- and this is why it's hard to get Sunni elements of the military to fight and resist ISIS moves. It's also why some key Sunni elements are reportedly in league with the ISIS jihadis. It's a reason to be careful about backing a government not committed to serious power sharing and reform, let alone to use direct U.S. military intervention to defend it. The U.S. couldn't build the new Iraq on the backs of American military power before it was clear that al-Maliki was a Shia triumphalist. How are we to do it today when it's clear that he is? The neighbors . Geography is destiny. This isn't America's neighborhood: It does not have the same kind of stake as those who live there. The U.S. may be committed to a nonsectarian, pluralist, democratic Iraq where everybody gets along in one big happy family. But Iran and Saudi Arabia envision very different outcomes, and they will act in ways detrimental to our interests. Iran is worried about ISIS to be sure. But Iran knows that its long-term interests depend on a stable Iraq under Shia dominance. That means that while it will assist al-Maliki, it won't pressure him to reform. The Saudis, on the other hand, can't abide al-Maliki and while they are worried about the Sunni jihadis, they see some merit in weakening the Prime Minister. Both Tehran and Riyadh will continue to see Iraq as a battleground to check the other's influence and to promote their side in a Sunni-Shia war. Iraq's stability and the U.S.'s altruistic vision of Iraq's future will be the casualties. The Syrian civil war . Any U.S. strategy that deals with Iraq in isolation will fail to get at a main sources of the ISIS threat. The Syrian civil war was a godsend for these jihadi groups. And unless the United States is prepared to expand its area of operations and to develop a sustained, aggressive strategy to contain if not destroy the ISIS presence in Syria, any effort in Iraq will at best produce a short-term success. Having willfully avoided militarizing the U.S. role in Syria, the President may well go ahead and do so now, with all the risks of mission creep. Attacking ISIS will also help Bashar al-Assad in Syria and Iran in Iraq. A serious strategy . And that brings us to the most difficult dimension of this entire problem. Without a serious and sustained strategy that has a military, counterterrorism, political and economic component, including mobilizing the international community, it's hard to see how the Obama administration can realistically put these Humpty Dumptys back together again. To do that would mean American involvement -- for starters CIA or special forces in an advisory capacity, most likely functioning clandestinely. Airstrikes, even if they worked to check ISIS, would have to be used repeatedly over time. And more training for the Iraqi military -- most likely with advisers on the ground to instruct in the use of sophisticated military equipment -- would be necessary. And despite all of this, it's likely that ISIS may still be able to secure enclaves in Iraq. Haven't we seen this movie before? It was called Iraq 2003-2011, and it clearly didn't have a happy ending. So, Mr. President, you probably have no other choice but to get sucked back into Iraq with military strikes. It might even have positive short-term results. But it likely won't over time. Triumphalist Shia, unhappy Sunnis, Iranian influence, and Kurdish separatists will guarantee it. Iraq was a trap for America once before. It will be again. 5 predictions revisited: Iraq's troubles are years in the making .","Writer: Obama administration will likely yield to pressure to act on ISIS advances in Iraq .

"Editor's note: C. Christine Fair is a political scientist at the RAND Corporation specializing in South Asian politics and military affairs. RAND is a nonprofit institution that conducts research and provides analysis to address challenges facing the United States and the world. Christine Fair says the Mumbai attacks highlighted sources of violence in the region. (CNN) -- As the last Mumbai sites were being cleared of terrorists, grim signs emerged of the challenges that face India and Pakistan. Unfortunately, beginning to know what the Mumbai attack was -- and what it was not -- only augurs more violence for India. At least three factors are at play. First, the fact that the attacks thus far have been attributed largely to Pakistani terrorists doesn't mean that India's internal challenges are less dire. Indian officials first claimed, based upon the reported testimony of the only surviving gunman, that the attack was perpetrated by 10 Pakistanis associated with the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, acting without the assistance of local facilitators. In recent days, Indian officials have embraced the possibility that Indians may have helped support the grisly attack. Indeed, India will continue to confront an expanding array of internal foes. Until recently, India has generally dismissed the importance of home-grown Islamist militant groups and has focused instead upon the Pakistan-based groups. Many within and without India have claimed that India's democratic institutions provide Muslims and other marginalized social groups political means to redress their grievances. Yet this narrative obscures the fact that many foreign terrorists have long relied upon Indians for logistical support, and disregards the increasing participation of Indian personnel in India's other recent attacks. Persistent social inequity for Muslims and other groups remains an important issue for the Indian state. Muslims in India are less likely to be educated and employed in government service and more likely to be poor. They face episodic but large-scale violence. Second, India will remain a target of Pakistan-based terrorism, and not only within its borders. The Indian Embassy in Kabul was attacked last summer with the involvement of the Pakistani government's Interservices Intelligence Directorate (ISI), according to American intelligence officials. Indian workers in Afghanistan also have been killed by militants there. Many Pakistanis believe that the British should have awarded the Muslim-majority state of Kashmir to Pakistan when it partitioned the subcontinent and withdrew from South Asia. Instead, its local leadership decided to join India. Pakistan has initiated three limited wars over Kashmir and has sustained a proxy war for nearly two decades. Indeed, most of the Islamist terrorist groups operating in and on behalf of ""liberating"" Kashmir were raised and directed by Pakistan's ISI. Yet the U.S. government has only episodically insisted that Pakistan eliminate all militant groups operating in and from Pakistan. Rather, it first focused its attention on al Qaeda and, in more recent years, the Taliban. No consistent message has been given about the militant groups that have largely set their sights on Kashmir and the Indian hinterland. Yet these groups have tremendous ability to attack and destabilize the region, as underscored by the near-war that developed after the December 2001 attack upon the Indian parliament by Pakistan-based militants. The deaths of Americans in Mumbai may have focused the attention of the American public, but Lashkar-e-Tayyiba has been targeting American and NATO forces in the Kunar and Nuristan provinces of northeastern Afghanistan for the last year. Pakistan's inability or unwillingness to eliminate all militant groups within its borders should have been viewed as an outrage before the Mumbai massacre. Since 2002, Pakistan has received some $12 billion from Washington, nearly half of it reimbursements for Pakistan's participation in the war on terror. Yet the international community is paralyzed and unable to forge a comprehensive approach to compel Pakistan to eliminate militancy, fearing variously that pressure will alienate Pakistan, destabilize the fragile democracy or undermine U.S. interests with a surge in nuclear proliferation. Others suggest that Pakistan no longer controls the militant groups it spawned and note that Pakistan too is a victim of terrorism. Third, India has not made adequate investments in its internal security infrastructure. It should reform its often corrupt and poorly trained and equipped police, expand their numbers and restructure their pay. India should also continue developing rapid-action counter-terrorism forces that are more dispersed across the country. It took some nine hours for India's well-trained National Security Guards to reach Mumbai, in part because they had no dedicated aircraft for their movements. Mumbai and other coastal cities remain vulnerable to attack by sea. India has been battling dozens of insurgencies and terrorist campaigns since its emergence as an independent state in 1947, yet it has failed to forge an appropriate strategy to deal with these challenges. India must improve social justice, provide better policing and law enforcement, harden targets where possible, and bolster intelligence capabilities and interagency coordination. The international community should deal forthrightly with Pakistan. Pakistan should detain suspects, clamp down on the raft of militant groups in its territory and cooperate fully with New Delhi. Perhaps Interpol may be a productive agency to use, since both states are members. Even if Pakistan cannot remand suspects to India for political reasons, it could try them in Pakistani courts, provided that India can provide evidence of their guilt. More than 10 days after the assault and under considerable international pressure, Pakistan has arrested activists associated with the organization. While this is an important step, Pakistan has not proscribed Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (now Jamaat ul Dawa), much less shut it down, and its leadership remains at large. Even if these arrests temper Indian sentiments, they fall short of eliminating the group's ability to operate. On all sides, the time for excuses is long past. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christine Fair.","Christine Fair: Mumbai attacks show sources of tension in the region .

"(CNN) -- After enjoying their city's Christmas tree lighting, Portland, Oregon, residents felt a twinge of shock and then a rush of gratitude on Saturday when they learned that law officers foiled a plot to set off a bomb in a state the suspect says ""nobody ever thinks about."" Mohamed Osman Mohamud, a 19-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen from Somalia, was seized in connection with a plan to detonate what he believed to be a vehicle bomb at the ceremony on Friday night, the Justice Department announced. Mohamud was whisked away by the FBI and Portland Police Bureau after he attempted to detonate what he believed was an explosives-laden van parked near the tree-lighting ceremony in Portland's Pioneer Courthouse Square, the Justice Department said in a written statement. But the bomb turned out to be fake, thanks to an undercover operation designed to undermine the plotter. Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said ""the materials were not explosive,"" and officials said the public was never in danger from the mock device. A resident of Corvallis, Oregon, and a student at Oregon State University, Mohamud -- who now faces a maximum sentence of life in prison and a $250,000 fine -- was arrested on suspicion of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction, the FBI said. He will make his initial appearance in federal court in Portland on Monday, the Justice Department said. ""It's very difficult for me to comprehend how a young man who this country has given great opportunities to could waste those opportunities and be willing to commit a horrific crime,"" said Portland Police Chief Michael Reese. ""It is very sad."" Portland residents who attended the tree lighting were pleased that law enforcement stopped the attack. Sharon Rose said she didn't know about the investigation until she returned home from the tree lighting. ""It does make me feel better that the FBI was on the ball in this case and doing some actual work, rather than pretending to look out for us and trying to make themselves look good,"" the Portland resident told CNN Radio. ""Why would anyone mess with Portland? It's such a sweet little town. Obviously somebody wanted to."" But Dwight C. Holton, U.S. attorney for the district of Oregon, said in a statement that this ""defendant's chilling determination is a stark reminder that there are people -- even here in Oregon -- who are determined to kill Americans."" Arthur Balizan, special agent in charge of the FBI in Oregon, called the threat ""very real."" ""Our investigation shows that Mohamud was absolutely committed to carrying out an attack on a very grand scale,"" Balizan said. ""At the same time, I want to reassure the people of this community that, at every turn, we denied him the ability to actually carry out the attack."" On his blog, Portland Mayor Sam Adams lauded a ""smart"" investigation by local, state and federal agencies that led to the capture of someone ""bent on mass destruction and murder in the city."" The arrest was the culmination of a long-term undercover operation during which Mohamud had been monitored closely as the alleged plot developed, the Justice Department said. According to an arrest warrant affidavit written by an FBI special agent, Mohamud was in e-mail communication in August 2009 with a person believed to be involved in terrorist activities. In December, that person was ""located in the northwest frontier province of Pakistan,"" the affidavit states. The two communicated regularly, the affidavit states, and ""using coded language, they discussed the possibility of Mohamud traveling to Pakistan to prepare for violent jihad."" Mohamud attempted to contact another associate who he thought would help facilitate his travel overseas, the affidavit states, but ""because Mohamud used the wrong e-mail address in his efforts to contact [the second associate], he never successfully contacted him to arrange travel."" An undercover FBI employee contacted Mohamud in June under the guise of being affiliated with the associate who was in Pakistan, according to the affidavit. Mohamud met with the undercover operative on July 30 in Portland. Mohamud allegedly told the undercover operative that he had written articles that were published in Jihad Recollections, an online magazine that advocated violent jihad. ""Mohamud also indicated that he wanted to become 'operational,'"" the Justice Department said. ""Asked what he meant by 'operational,' Mohamud stated that he wanted to put an 'explosion' together, but needed help."" At a meeting in August, the Justice Department said, Mohamud allegedly told undercover FBI operatives he had been thinking of committing violent jihad since the age of 15. According to the affidavit, Mohamud then told undercover operatives that he had identified a potential target for a bomb: the annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland's Pioneer Courthouse Square. Authorities said an FBI operative pointed out that lots of children would be at such an event, but Mohamud said he was looking for a ""huge mass that will ... be attacked in their own element with their families celebrating the holidays."" Officials said Mohamud also stated, ""... it's in Oregon; and Oregon like you know, nobody ever thinks about it."" According to the affidavit, Mohamud and the undercover FBI operatives traveled to a remote area in Lincoln County, Oregon, on November 4 and detonated a bomb hidden in a backpack as a test. During the drive back to Corvallis, the agents asked Mohamud about whether he could look at the bodies of those who would be killed in the upcoming attack in Portland, the Justice Department said. Mohamud replied, ""I want whoever is attending that event to leave, to leave either dead or injured,"" according to the affidavit. On Friday, Mohamud met one of the FBI operatives at a predetermined location, the affidavit states. Mohamud dialed a number ""in an unsuccessful attempt to detonate the device."" Mohamud allegedly dialed the number again before he was taken custody. Portland police Sgt.

"(CNN) -- Negotiators for Iran and six world powers completed the first day of discussions on Iran's nuclear program Monday in Moscow. This third round of talks, called after two previous rounds of discussions yielded little result, was marked by ""serious and constructive"" discussions, Iran's semi-official FARS News Agency quoted Deputy Chief Negotiator Ali Baqeri as saying. An EU official described the meeting as an ""intense and tough exchange of views."" Western powers fear that Iran may be trying to build nuclear weapons, despite its insistence that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. The West has been using sanctions and diplomacy to try to stop Iran from producing nuclear arms. The EU official, who was not authorized to speak to the media due to the sensitivity of the talks, said Iran responded to proposals brought up at the last round of talks in Baghdad, ""but, in doing so, brought up lots of questions and well-known positions, including past grievances."" Iran rejected calls during earlier talks for it not to enrich uranium to the point that it can be used for weapons, while the international powers refused Tehran's demand for an immediate end to sanctions weighing on its economy. Iran's leaders also continued to take a firm line outside of the negotiations. On Monday, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the country has been the object of ""non-stop conspiracies of all the world powers."" ""But the efforts of all the hegemonic powers to push the Iranian nation out of the scene will definitely and surely remain futile again this time,"" he said. EXCLUSIVE: Israel's president warns ""time is out"" for Iran . If the negotiations in Moscow unravel, the potential consequences for the Middle East and the rest of the world could be grave. Israel, which is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal and is alarmed over Tehran's hostility toward the Jewish state, has said it may attack Iran to try to stop Tehran from developing nuclear weapons. And Iran's strategic position near crucial oil shipping routes means the escalation of tensions could put further pressure on the fragile global economy. After the previous round of negotiations in Baghdad last month, which ran beyond the original schedule, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton offered a glimmer of hope for the Moscow talks. ""It's clear that we both want to make progress,"" she said at the time. Iran's top negotiator, Saeed Jalili, struck a nuanced position after the Baghdad talks, asserting Iran's right to pursue peaceful nuclear energy but also saying that progress had been made during the meeting. Sanctions imposed on Iran by the United Nations, the United States and the European Union were one of the key stumbling blocks. The sanctions appear to be inflicting considerable damage on the Iranian economy. And because 80% of Iran's foreign revenues are derived from oil exports, an embargo by the EU set to go into effect in July will add further pressure. Jalili said that the removal of ""hostile measures"" would increase cooperation. ""The current strategy of pressure could make the talks come to an end,"" he warned. Iran has previously threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil shipping lane, over the sanctions issue. But U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton insisted the sanctions will remain in place. ""Iran now has the choice to make,"" she said. ""Will it meet its international obligations and give the world confidence about its intentions, or not."" The six world powers made Iran an offer for stopping its processing of medium-enriched uranium, EU officials said. The proposal also called for Tehran to prove its nuclear program is being used for peaceful purposes as it claims, and comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions, according to a Western official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions. Iran's counterproposal included five areas of nuclear and non-nuclear cooperation, according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. Adding to the complexity of the situation, a U.N. report released just after the Baghdad talks said that inspectors had found a high level of enriched uranium in Iran. The U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency asked Iran to explain the presence of particles of enrichment levels of up to 27%, found in an analysis of environmental samples taken in February at the Fordo fuel enrichment plant near the city of Qom. The previous highest level had been 20%, typically used for hospital isotopes and research reactors, but is also seen as a shortcut toward the 90% enrichment required to build nuclear weapons. Iran said in response that the production of such particles ""above the target value"" may happen for ""technical reasons beyond the operator's control.""

"(CNN) -- Pirates traded gunfire with Togo security forces early Tuesday from a hijacked oil tanker off the west coast of Africa, the International Maritime Bureau said. ""Apparently there was an exchange of fire between pirates on board the hijacked tanker and the naval patrol vessel,"" said Cyrus Mody, spokesman for the maritime bureau, based in London. A representative for Golden Energy Management, the Greek company that chartered the vessel, said there were 24 crew members on board, all of them Russian. The representative had no information on the condition of the crew and said company officials in Athens have been unable to establish contact with the sailors. The Isle of Man-flagged Energy Centurion was seized off the coast of the Togolese capital Lome, where it was anchored. A security official in Togo said authorities received the alert from the oil tanker around 2 a.m. ""We quickly sent patrols after it, but we did not succeed in catching the pirates who took control of the tanker and disappeared off the coast of neighboring Benin,"" said Col. Djibril Inoussa, the communications director of Togo Armed Forces. Pirate attacks down off Somalia, up off Nigeria . This is the second such attack in less than two weeks in the Gulf of Guinea, off the west coast of Africa. ""This has been an area of risk and a hotspot for a number of years,"" said Mody. He said the number of piracy incidents in Nigerian waters has been severely under-reported, and tend to be overshadowed by Somali piracy. While Somali piracy remains a serious threat, there has been an increase of attacks in the Gulf of Guinea, according to a recent report from International Maritime Bureau's Piracy Reporting Center. The report said there were 32 attacks this year in the Gulf of Guinea -- including five hijackings, versus 25 in 2011. The main difference between the East and West African pirate activities is that almost all the incidents in Nigeria are conducted within its territorial waters, whereas most of the incidents along the eastern coast of Africa and the Gulf of Aden occur on the high seas, according to the maritime bureau. Mody said it is possible that the same group responsible for Tuesday's attack was involved in the hijacking of a UK-operated oil tanker August 19. That vessel was later released off the coast of Nigeria. ""Their modus-operandi is to target mainly oil tankers, and steal the cargo,"" said Mody. He said refined oil -- gas or diesel -- is easy to sell on open black markets. The hijacked vessel is then either taken to the same location where it was picked up, or moved to another site and released. Mody said pirates also go through each crew cabin to see what they can take. He said crews are often beaten up, sometimes severely. ""Nigerian incidents tend to be very violent towards the crew,"" Mody said. Man described as high-ranking Somali pirate gets multiple life sentences .

A Danish warship, the Absalon, tasked with patrolling waters near the Somali coast to ward off piracy, fired warning shots against what the navy described as a pirate ""mother ship"" that failed to stop, the military said. Military personnel then boarded the vessel and found 17 suspected pirates and 18 hostages, two of whom were critically wounded. Despite medical treatment, navy doctors were unable save their lives, the military said. An investigation into the deaths is under way.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The leader of one of the labs linked to an accidental anthrax exposure at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been reassigned, CDC spokesman Tom Skinner says. Skinner would not confirm the name of the person who was reassigned. Skinner said the agency is still investigating how as many as 86 Atlanta-based workers were possibly exposed to anthrax. The workers are being monitored and provided antibiotics. ""Based on most of the potential exposure scenarios, the risk of infection is very low,"" the agency said in a statement last week. ""CDC believes that other CDC staff, family members, and the general public are not at risk of exposure and do not need to take any protective action."" Early reports showed that a lab did not adequately inactivate samples, which were then moved and used for experimentation in three laboratories not equipped to handle live Bacillus anthracis, or anthrax. Believing the samples were inactivated, workers in those labs did not don adequate protective equipment, the CDC said. The unintentional exposure was discovered June 13. What to know about anthrax . Sometime between then and June 6, procedures in two of the three labs may have aerosolized the spores, the CDC said. Hallway and lab areas were decontaminated. There are three types of anthrax infection: cutaneous (through the skin), inhalation (through the lungs) and gastrointestinal (through digestion). Early symptoms can suggest the flu. ""In the worst-case scenarios, literally, within a day or two of exposure, if you've inhaled spores and if they are very lethal, one begins to get -- as they say -- the standard flu symptoms -- high fever, malaise,"" said Leonard Cole, a bioterrorism expert. ""You get lazy. You feel sick. You get headaches. You get bone aches. ""And then after a day or two, in the worst case, if you don't get treatment, it could be lethal for you, and beyond treatment,"" he said.

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Mexican authorities are having an Eliot Ness moment. Imagine what it felt like for the famed U.S. federal agent to arrest legendary gangster Al Capone in 1929. It's probably close to how our southern neighbors feel now that they have in custody Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, leader of the brutal paramilitary drug cartel known as The Zetas. The takedown is a major coup for Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, who came to office just seven months ago and returned the Institutional Revolutionary Party to power. I had the chance to meet with Peña Nieto in Mexico City in November a few weeks before he was sworn in, as part of a group of other Americans. It was clear from what we heard that he intended to implement a different strategy against the cartels than the one deployed by former President Felipe Calderon, who hailed from the rival National Action Party. His predecessor took the fight to the cartels, and the result was more than 70,000 deaths with some estimates reaching as high as 120,000. Even before he was elected, Peña Nieto had signaled to Mexico's voters that surrender wasn't an option, that legalizing drugs wasn't on the table, and that the fight against the cartels would continue -- with different methods and objectives. The new plan was to continue to confiscate the traffickers' money and drugs while not driving up the body count. Peña Nieto was supposed to focus less on capturing drug lords and more on curtailing violence and protecting the Mexican people. I wanted to understand this terrain better. And so, before I left Mexico City, I met up with an old friend who also happens to be one of the best reporters in the business and certainly one of the most knowledgable about Mexico. Alfredo Corchado is the Mexico City bureau chief for the Dallas Morning News and author of the acclaimed new book, ""Midnight in Mexico: A Reporter's Journey Through a Country's Descent into Darkness."" I asked him if Americans should be concerned now that there is a new sheriff in town. What is to stop Peña Nieto from giving up on this war? ""I don't think they can afford to give up on it,"" Corchado said. ""That would be like conceding the country. And yet, I also think the strategy of going after the cartels, confronting them head-on, is only going to generate more and more violence."" This is supposed to be a new kind of drug war, although it bears a striking resemblance to the old war. As critics have pointed out, the number of casualties in first six months of Peña Nieto's administration are almost identical to the number in the last six months of Calderon's tenure in office. Some Mexicans are wondering if, politics aside, the two major political parties in Mexico will turn out to be more or less the same in the war on drug trafficking. For a frame of reference from this side of the border, think about how -- in fighting the war on terror -- President Obama has borrowed liberally from President George W. Bush's strategies for securing the U.S. homeland. And from the looks of it, Mexico's enemy is just as determined as ours to wreak havoc and create nightmares. In the last 10 years, the drug trade in Mexico has become much more brutal. A big reason for that is the arrival on the scene of The Zetas, and dangerous individuals like Trevino Morales who had a $5 million bounty on his head courtesy of the U.S. government. The cartel is a relative newcomer in Mexico's bloody drug trade. Its origins date back to 1999, when elite commandos of the Mexican army decided that they would rather work for the drug traffickers than shoot it out with them. So they deserted and became the muscle of the powerful and well-established Gulf Cartel. In 2010, Los Zetas went into business for themselves. Three things set them apart: They have diversified their illicit activities beyond drug trafficking to include extortion, kidnapping, prostitution and other crimes; they're more sophisticated and tech savvy than their rivals, according to U.S. authorities; and they are much more violent and apt to brutally terrorize the population -- with beheadings, torture, mass killings, grenades tossed into crowds, bodies hanging in the town square like pinatas at the mercado, and more. Even with Trevino Morales behind bars, the horror is likely to continue. His brother is in line to succeed him. The metaphor you hear from the cynics in Mexico is that when authorities cut off the head of the serpent, another head grows in its place. Perhaps. But high-profile arrests like these do serve a purpose. They put the cartels on notice that they're in the cross hairs, and make it clear that the Mexican government won't negotiate with narco-terrorists. That chapter of the story is new, at least when you think about how cozy these parties were a few decades ago. ""For 50 or 60 years, we looked the other way,"" said Corchado. ""It's like you don't want to let the evil spirit out of the bottle. That's what we did in Mexico for too long, and now that it's out, you're going to have to face a monster."" Now that our neighbors are no longer looking the other way and they're confronting their monster, Americans must continue to back them up so they don't have to do it alone. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those Ruben Navarrette.","Mexico arrested Miguel Trevino Morales, leader of the brutal drug cartel The Zetas .

"(CNN) -- Rep. Charlie Rangel is claiming victory in his last dance. The Democratic congressman from New York, who was first elected to the House of Representatives 44 years ago, appears to have survived a fierce primary challenge. Rangel, who says this will be his last re-election campaign, will likely edge out state Sen. Adriano Espaillat, who came close to ousting Rangel in the Democratic primary two years ago. With 100% of precincts reporting, Rangel held a 47%-44% lead over Espaillat, with two other candidates grabbing 9% of the vote, according to numbers compiled by the Associated Press. Espaillat did not concede Tuesday night. Rangel was one of two four-decade veterans of Congress who avoided being ousted from office. After a long and bitter fight, Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi will manage to fend off a serious tea party challenge in Tuesday's GOP Senate runoff, CNN projects, and move closer to a seventh term. With 99% of the precincts counted, Cochran held a 51%-49% lead over state Sen. Chris McDaniel, who forced Cochran into the runoff after both candidates fell just short of the 50% threshold needed to avoid a longer contest. In the primary, McDaniel edged out Cochran by less than 1,500 votes. In a bizarre twist, it might be Democrats that helped push Cochran ahead at the finish line. Along with Mississippi and New York, six other states held contests Tuesday. Democrats likely swung GOP contest . To clinch the GOP nomination, Cochran's backers turned to Democrats, especially African-Americans who make up 37% of the state's population. Cochran's supporters actively reminded voters of the senator's work to secure federal funds for programs relied upon by African-Americans, like Head Start and certain medical centers in the state. It's the kind of message that Republicans barely tout these days, given the renewed focus on fiscal conservatism. But Cochran supporters viewed Democrats as key to their strategy to knock out McDaniel after the incumbent barely kept his reelection hopes alive in the primary. Mississippi law allows anyone to vote in the runoff, meaning Democrats could go to the polls so long as they didn't vote in the Democratic primary and they don't plan to support their party's candidate in the general election. But McDaniel and allies argued the tactic was a stretch, and he argued that a high Democratic turnout for Cochran would reveal the senator's true colors. Final chapter underway in nation's ugliest primary . ""I'm not concerned about them being African-American. I'm concerned about them being liberal,"" he told CNN. ""That's always been my concern. If Senator Cochran is going to court liberal Democrats to save his seat, that's a good indication that he's abandoned conservatism in Mississippi."" As Cochran declared victory, McDaniel railed against Cochran's campaign tactic of stirring support among Democrats. ""There is something a bit unusual about a Republican primary decided by liberal Democrats,"" he said. ""So much for bold colors. So much for principles. I guess they can take some consolation that they did something tonight for once again compromising, for once again reaching across the aisle, for abandoning the conservative movement."" McDaniel added: ""If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere. And that's why we will never stop fighting."" Mississippi law doesn't include provisions for election recounts. Any challenge to race results would have to go through the courts. 5 primaries worth watching on Tuesday . To make sure Democratic voters weren't voting illegally, conservative groups supportive of McDaniel dispatched volunteers to observe poll workers and whether they're turning away those who already showed up in the Democratic primary. But that effort raised eyebrows from groups like the NAACP, which sent out its own volunteers to look for any signs of voter intimidation or interference. Rangel's last dance . Win or lose, Rangel of New York says this is his last campaign. The Korean War veteran, who was first elected to the House of Representatives 44 years ago, is trying keep from getting pushed out office by Espaillat, who came within around 1,100 votes of ousting Rangel in the Democratic primary two years ago. ""As we learned in 2012, every single vote needs to be counted in this race. Given the thousands of votes outstanding, the people of Upper Manhattan and The Bronx deserve a full accounting of every vote to achieve a complete and accurate tally in this race,"" Espaillat said in a statement in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Rangel, the former chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, was forced to step down from his post in 2010 and later that year he was censured by the House for ethics violations. Just as damaging for Rangel was the redrawing of New York's 13th Congressional District after the 2010 election, from a Harlem-based, African-American-dominated district to one that now has a Hispanic majority, thanks to shedding parts of Harlem and adding other neighborhoods in northern Manhattan and parts of the Bronx. Rangel, the ""Lion of Harlem"" and a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said he didn't put up much of a fight in 2012. ""I didn't have a campaign last time. When he told me he was running, I was in Columbia Presbyterian with a viral infection in my spine."" This time, Rangel said he's ready. ""Well, I don't have a walker. I don't have a spinal injury."" Espaillat says Rangel is emblematic of all that ills Congress. ""This is a coalition of victory that is completely convinced that Washington is broken and that at the center of that dysfunction is a gentleman called Charles Rangel,"" he said Saturday. Rangel's confidence was buoyed by a nonpartisan poll last week that indicated he held a 13-point lead over Espaillat, who if elected in November would become the first member of Congress born in the Dominican Republic. But some political analysts say it's difficult to poll in the district and feel the race is much closer. Plus, Rangel suffered the embarrassment of failing to win endorsements from President Barack Obama and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. Tea party vs. establishment battle with a twist . Rep. James Lankford easily won Oklahoma's Republican Senate primary, in the race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Tom Coburn. Lankford topped former state House Speaker T.W. Shannon. Coburn's announcement in January that he would step down at the end of the year -- with two years left in his term -- sparked a competitive primary in Oklahoma to replace the conservative senator. There were seven candidates in the race, but the contest turned into a battle between the two frontrunners: Lankford and Shannon. For a party looking for more diversity, the 36-year old Shannon, who was the youngest speaker ever of the Oklahoma House, was an attractive choice. He's part Native American and African-American. He was backed by such tea party heroes as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. And some national anti-establishment organizations pumped big bucks into the race in support of Shannon. But many local tea party groups kept their distance, with some questioning Shannon's outsider credentials. In fact, Shannon's no stranger to politics. He worked for Oklahoma Republican Rep. Tom Cole and former congressman J.C. Watts before launching his own political career. Lankford, who has risen through the ranks to become Republican Policy Committee Chairman -- the fifth-ranking House Republican -- in just two terms in Congress, was criticized by many on the right for his vote to raise the debt ceiling. But labeling the Baptist minister with strong social conservative backing as an establishment candidate was a hard case to make. ""The job is clear,"" Lankford repeated throughout his victory speech -- ticking off a number of Republican prescriptions to fix the economy, including repealing Obamacare, cutting down on environmental regulation and limiting federal spending. ""I was a member of the class of 2010 in the House of Representatives. It was that class that moved Nancy Pelosi back to flying coach again,"" he said. ""If we win in November, I pray we can do this same thing for Sen. Reid."" Lankford had a 57%-34% lead with 99% of the vote counted, according to numbers compiled by the AP. Conceding the race, Shannon said: ""Tonight this campaign is over but our cause remains and our cause continues."" ""We must get rid of Harry Reid. That means we have to send Republicans to the Senate and that Republican is James Lankford,"" he added. Other races on our radar . CNN projects that Maryland Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown will win the state's Democratic gubernatorial primary. The two-term lieutenant governor faced off in an ugly primary battle against state Attorney General Doug Gansler and state lawmaker Heather Mizeur. In a state dominated by Democrats, Brown will now be considered the favorite to win the general election in the race to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Martin O'Malley. Brown was backed by O'Malley, a potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, as well as former President Bill Clinton. Brown will go on to face Republican Larry Hogan in the general election. If he wins in November, Brown would become the third African-American elected governor in U.S. history. In Colorado, CNN projects that former Rep. Bob Beauprez will win the GOP primary for governor, topping anti-immigration firebrand Tom Tancredo, a former congressman and presidential hopeful, and two other candidates. Beauprez will face Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper in November. And in Florida, Republican businessman Curt Clawson won the special general election to replace embattled former Rep. Trey Radel. Clawson easily defeated Democrat April Freeman and two other candidates in the race for the state's 19th Congressional District. The heavily Republican district runs along Florida's Gulf of Mexico coast from Cape Coral and Fort Myers south to Naples and Marco Island. Clawson will serve out the remainder of Radel's term, which runs through the end of the year. There will be an August primary ahead of November's general election. Radel, a fellow Republican, was arrested last year for cocaine possession, and resigned from Congress in January.

"(CNN) -- One endless June afternoon a decade ago, I drove along southern Iceland's Highway One, past the weak spot in the planetary crust whose rupture recently brought air traffic in Europe to an ashen standstill. It was summer solstice, a day when the sun lolled at the horizon but never set, turning to crimson the basalt cliffs that face the Atlantic. From countless crags along their length gushed great arcs of water, pressured from above by a weight draped over a hundred square kilometers like a huge slab of white cake frosting: the 200-meter-thick Eyjafjallajokull glacier. Between the coastal cliffs and the ice lay a band of green slopes, five kilometers wide, interspersed with fjords and valleys that held clusters of farmhouses and barns with red metal roofs, their shining silos and occasional church steeples pointed toward the immense glacier hovering overhead. The air, brilliantly clear, resounded with terns, orange-billed oystercatchers, petrels, whimbrels and musical wagtails. At 8 in the evening, farmers in overalls were still out haying, their pale hair aflame in the suspended daylight. I saw a string of 10 riders on buckskin and dun mounts, forelegs lifted in the extra-high gait unique to Icelandic horses, making them appear to be swimming through the deep green ribbon at the glacier's edge. That extended, gilded moment was as perfect a definition of beauty on Earth as I have known. It remains indelible, even though over the past week, much of what I saw was swept away as Eyjafjallajokull's erupting volcano melted a gaping hole in its ice cap, flooding what lay below. A big clue as to why that happened can be found an hour's drive to the west, halfway between Eyjafjallajokull and Iceland's capital, Reykjavik, in a broad valley with a sharp cleft down its middle. That place, Thingvellir,  is so famous in Icelandic history that practically no signs announce it, because everyone knows what and where it is. In A.D. 930, more than a thousand years after the decline of ancient Greece, Thingvellir was where Western democracy was reborn. By coincidence -- or maybe not -- the spot where the Norsk settlers who made up the island's infant society chose to convene their first parliament is one of the few places on the Earth's surface where the geologic action that defines our planet's land and seas is visible. Here, astride the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the North American and Eurasian plates pull away from each other. Perhaps 20 million years ago, this wrenching forced an upwelling of hot rock to rise through the ocean, and Iceland was formed. Thingvellir's rift valley floor is scored with cracks and fissures; at one point, a lava escarpment that is the eastern edge of North America towers 30 meters higher than the western edge of Europe. The continents are currently recoiling from each other at a clip of two centimeters per year, a process that daily releases clouds of geothermic steam and sends geysers skyward -- and, sometimes, molten magma and volcanic ash. Of course, the farmers who gathered in this shattered young landscape more than a millennium ago to lay down terms for civilization had no inkling that to the west lay an entire New World, where their democratic example would one day be magnified until it forged the philosophical basis for the most powerful country the planet has ever seen. Both Iceland and the United States exalt democracy as a social achievement worthy of lasting an eternity. Yet the latter's unprecedented strength has derived not just from enlightened government, but from the release of its own hot clouds: exhaust from its vast industries, fleets and mechanized agriculture. As we have learned, these gases form an invisible barrier that, like a greenhouse's glass ceiling, keeps reflected heat of the sun from escaping our atmosphere. The denser that gaseous barrier grows, the hotter things get and the faster glaciers melt. As they flow off the land, we are warned, seas rise. Yet something else is lately worrying geologists: the likelihood that the Earth's crust, relieved of so much formidable weight of ice borne for many thousands of years, has begun to stretch and rebound. As it does, a volcano awakens in Iceland (with another, larger and adjacent to still-erupting Eyjafjallajokull, threatening to detonate next). The Earth shudders in Haiti. Then Chile. Then western China. Mexicali-Calexico. The Solomon Islands. Spain. New Guinea. And those are just the big ones, 6+ on the Richter scale, and just in 2010. And it's only April. It's looking like this may be a long decade. And if we don't pull carbon out of the way we energize our lives soon, a small clump of our not-too-distant surviving descendants may find themselves, as Gaia scientist James Lovelock has direly predicted, like the first Icelanders: gathered on some near-barren hunk of rock near one of the still-habitable poles, trying yet anew to eke out a plan for human civilization. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alan Weisman.","Iceland has great volcanic activity, is where European and North American continents meet .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan's nuclear watchdog on Wednesday said a toxic water leak at the tsunami-damaged Fukushima Daiichi power plant has been classified as a level 3 ""serious incident"" on an international scale. The Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) said it had made the decision after consulting with the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, said Juntaro Yamada, a spokesman for the regulator. As news emerged last week of the leak of hundreds of tons of radioactive water from a storage tank, the NRA said it was planning to issue the alert, its gravest warning since the massive 2011 earthquake and tsunami that sent three reactors at the plant into meltdown. The leak had previously been assigned a level 1 ""anomaly rating"" on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale, which ranges from zero, for no safety threat, to seven, for a major accident like the meltdowns. The decision to issue the level 3 alert came two days after a Japanese government minister had compared the plant operator's efforts to deal with worrying toxic water leaks at the site to a game of ""whack-a-mole."" Toshimitsu Motegi, the industry minister, said Monday after visiting the plant that ""from now on, the government is going to step forward."" His ministry has been tasked by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to come up with measures to tackle the mounting problems at Fukushima Daiichi. TEPCO looks for outside help to stabilize Fukushima . Huge volumes of toxic water . The plant operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), has been struggling to deal with the high volume of contaminated water at the plant. Last month, Tepco admitted that radioactive groundwater was leaking into the Pacific Ocean from the site, bypassing an underground barrier built to seal in the water. About 400 tons of groundwater flow into the site each day, and Tepco also pumps large amounts water through the buildings to keep the crippled reactors cool. Fukishima tuna study finds miniscule health risks . The operator has stored hundreds of thousands of tons of the contaminated water in huge tanks at the site. There are now about 1,000 of the containers, 93% of which are already full of radioactive water. Around 350 of the tanks were built as temporary storage units in the aftermath of the meltdowns. But more than two years later, they are still being used. It was one of those makeshift tanks where the leak was detected, setting off the latest crisis. Tepco says it has transferred the remaining tainted water from the faulty tank to another container. But it hasn't said what caused the leak in the first place. Japan ponders freezing ground . CNN's Junko Ogura reported from Tokyo, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.","The alert is Japan's gravest warning since meltdowns at the nuclear plant in 2011 .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Somali pirates freed a British hostage Wednesday, nearly seven months after she was taken captive in a raid at a Kenyan beach resort in which her husband was killed. Judith Tebbutt said in a statement she was hugely relieved to be free and overjoyed to be reunited with her son, Ollie. She said he had played a key role in securing her release. ""This, however, is a time when my joy at being safe again is overwhelmed by my immense grief, shared by Ollie and the wider family, following David's passing in September last year,"" she said. ""My family and I now need to grieve properly. ""I hope that while I adjust to my freedom and the devastating loss of my husband, that I and my family will be allowed space, time and most of all privacy, to come to terms with the events of the last six months,"" her statement said. Tebbutt was flown out of Adado, Somalia, to the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. ""The priority now is to get her to a place of safety,"" said a spokesman from the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Tebbutt's release came after lengthy negotiations between elders in Adado and local authorities, said Omar Mohammed Diirey, a regional administration official in central Somalia. He described Tebbutt as ""very tired and pale but fine otherwise."" Somali Information Minister H.E. Abdulkadir Hussein expressed relief at Tebbutt's release. ""The Somali government will assist in any way it can in the capture and the arrest of the kidnappers who murdered her husband and kept her hostage since September 2011,"" he said, urging assistance from the international community in thwarting the extremism and piracy plaguing the Horn of Africa nation. Tebbutt was abducted from a safari lodge in the popular Kenyan tourist town of Lamu in September. Gunmen fatally shot her husband, David Tebbutt, when he resisted, according to Kenyan police. Judith Tebbutt was spirited away aboard a pirates' speedboat. Journalist Mohamed Amiin Adow contributed to this report.","Judith Tebbutt was abducted by Somali pirates last September .

"(CNN) -- While hosting CNN's Crossfire this week, I said: ""Republicans are practically cheering for Vladimir Putin today. He's given them a new excuse to bash President Obama."" I pointed out that Republicans have been slamming Obama for his handling of the Ukraine crisis even though I have not heard a single, specific way in which they would handle the situation differently. No new ideas, just new insults. The howls came quickly, and my assertion has been repeatedly attacked and mischaracterized. But the evidence to support it is, troublingly, everywhere. I'm not saying Republicans are pro-Putin or that they want him to invade Ukraine. But they certainly have — conveniently, even gleefully -- found a good way to put Putin's actions to political use at home. Just listen to former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani on Monday: ""Putin decides what he wants to do and he does it in half a day... he makes a decision and he executes it. Quickly. Then everybody reacts. That's what you call a leader."" And Sarah Palin: ""People are looking at Putin as one who wrestles bears and drills for oil; they look at our President as one who wears mom jeans and equivocates and bloviates."" Republican leaders are not only bashing Obama, but appearing to praise Putin. There's more: Sen. John McCain, R- Arizona, seemed to blame the Ukraine crisis on Obama, telling the American Israel Public Affairs Committee this week, ""this is the ultimate result of a feckless foreign policy in which nobody believes in America's strength anymore."" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, has weighed in: ""We have a weak and indecisive President that invites aggression,"" as did Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas: ""Emboldened by President Obama's trembling inaction, Vladimir Putin has invaded the Crimea region of Ukraine."" And on and on. Opinion: 5 lessons for a new Cold War . Listen, there's nothing wrong with criticizing the President's policy positions or actions. To hold a President's feet to the fire over every aspect of government is the job not only of our elected leaders but of all citizens. Substantive dissent is indeed patriotic. But substantive dissent is not what we have here. We have baseless, petty politics that are ultimately counterproductive to America's global standing. On Saturday, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, published a list of steps he thinks Obama should take to ""punish Russia."" They included calling Russia's actions an invasion — which, um, Secretary of State John Kerry actually did the same day that Rubio made his demand — and sending Kerry to Kiev, which was announced a day later. The ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, called for immediate sanctions against Russia--but the Treasury Department under Obama's direction was already drafting a package of stiff sanctions. Republicans have also called for visa bans for Russian leaders and asset freezes. Well, on Sunday, Kerry said, ""There could even be, ultimately, asset freezes, visa bans. There could be certainly disruption of any of the normal trade routine. There could be business drawback on investment in the country."" He said the major world powers are ""going to isolate Russia"" and ""all options are on the table."" U.S. paves way for sanctions on Russians, Ukrainians over Crimea . If the Obama administration is already acting on the initiatives that its Republican critics are demanding in response to the Ukraine crisis, why are they complaining? Because, they allege, it's because Obama has been so weak for five years that Putin thought he could get away with invading Ukraine. Let's look at that argument more closely. In August 2008, Vladimir Putin invaded the Republic of Georgia while George W. Bush was President of the United States. Where were the ""weakness"" complaints from Republicans? Well, conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer — who has said that in the Ukraine situation Obama's ""inaction created a vacuum"" and who derided the President's statements on Ukraine as ""weak"" — said of the Georgia invasion back in 2008, ""Well, obviously it's beyond our control. The Russians are advancing. There is nothing that will stop them."" Conservative Heritage Foundation national security staffer Peter Brookes exuded a similar calm in 2008: ""There's no easy answer; there's only tough choices... Russia is a tough nut to crack."" Apparently when a Democrat is president the situation is much simpler. Last Friday, Brookes explained that the Russian invasion of Crimea is proof that ""this administration's policy toward Russia has been a failure."" Hmmm.... There's another aspect to this Republican hypocrisy. McCain recently called Obama ""the most naïve president in history"" because of his foreign policy tactics. And yet it was George W. Bush who famously said, upon meeting Putin, ""I looked the man in the eye. I found him to be very straight forward and trustworthy, and we had a very good dialogue. I was able to get a sense of his soul."" Did Republicans find him ""weak""? ""Naïve""? Contrast this with Obama, who, against considerable odds, wrangled Russia into a constructive role on Iran sanctions, Syrian chemical weapons removal and a new START treaty. It is not merely laughable to call this President, who has unfortunately expanded the use of drone warfare and who also ordered the mission to kill Osama bin Laden, ""weak."" It is also self-destructive to our national interest, since absent any substantive disagreements, it reveals only national disunity in the face of a global crisis. It's what Republicans might call -- if the other party were doing it — poor leadership. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sally Kohn.","Sally Kohn: I was slammed for saying GOP practically cheering Putin while bashing Obama .
But evidence abounds, in remarks by McCain, Giuliani, many commentators, she says .
She says Obama already doing what GOP suggests on Ukraine .
Kohn: GOP's hypocrisy, criticism of President is destructive ."
"(CNN) -- The attorney for an Indian diplomat whose arrest and detention in New York sparked an international controversy on visa fraud charges said Thursday the allegations are baseless. And he accused U.S. authorities of deliberately mishandling her arrest. ""They were trying to humiliate her and flex their muscle, and they succeeded in doing that,"" Dan Arshack, lawyer for Devyani Khobragade, told CNN's ""New Day."" But the attorney for a housekeeper at the center of allegations that Khobragade violated an agreement in a visa document by underpaying her said Arshack is the one who doesn't have the facts straight. The salvos came a day after the chief federal prosecutor in Manhattan, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, lashed out at those questioning the legitimacy of the case, which has infuriated Indian society and led to repercussions from the Indian government. ""This office's sole motivation in this case, as in all cases, is to uphold the rule of law, protect victims, and hold accountable anyone who breaks the law -- no matter what their societal status and no matter how powerful, rich or connected they are,"" he said in a statement. Khobragade, India's deputy consul general in New York, was arrested and stripped-searched last week on charges of visa fraud related to her treatment of her housekeeper, who has been publicly identified as Sangeeta Richard. ""This type of fraud on the United States and exploitation of an individual will not be tolerated,"" Bharara said. The case has sparked outrage among different, conflicting camps: those slamming her treatment as ""barbaric"" and those saying the real issue is the alleged mistreatment of domestic workers. The case has reverberated in Washington and New Delhi. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called her treatment ""deplorable."" In a statement, Secretary of State John Kerry expressed ""regret"" over the situation, without saying the United States had done anything wrong. ""In terms of our relationship with the United States, I do feel this must be resolved,"" Indian External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid said, according to CNN sister network IBN. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns and Undersecretary Wendy Sherman sought to diffuse tensions through discussions with Indian officials. A senior official said the U.S. government is most concerned about India's response in removing security barriers at the embassy in New Dehli and whether India might subject a U.S. diplomat to treatment similar to what Khobragade went through during her detention in New York. In court documents and in a public statement, Bharara -- who was himself born in India -- states that Khobragade lied in a visa application, promising to pay her housekeeper the minimum wage of $9.75. She would actually be paid $3.31 per hour. Khobragade allegedly instructed the housekeeper to say she would be paid the higher rate and not mention her actual pay. Khobragade allegedly had the housekeeper sign another employment contract establishing the lower pay. The second contract, which was not to be revealed to the U.S. government, ""deleted the required language protecting the victim from other forms of exploitation and abuse"" and also deleted language that said Khobragade agreed to abide by U.S. laws, Bharara said Wednesday. Khobragade is charged with one count of visa fraud and one count of making false statements, which carry a combined maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. The allegations have ""nothing to do with what the actual facts are,"" Arshack told CNN Thursday. Khobragade abided by the terms of the contract that was submitted, he said. ""There was no fraud."" The second contract, Arshack alleged, was one the domestic worker requested, ""which would confirm that a portion of the money that she was going to get paid would get sent directly to her husband in New Delhi. And that's what happened. And that's what the documents support."" But Dana Sussman, the housekeeper's attorney, said his client was only paid the smaller amount, which was deposited into an Indian bank account. Her client denies being given any money in the United States that could be considered a salary, she said. ""I don't know what he's talking about,"" Sussman said of Arshack's claims. ""This story seems to keep changing."" Indian diplomat: Does she have immunity? Dispute over diplomat's treatment . U.S. authorities should have handled the case differently, Arshack argued. A financial dispute could be handled as a civil action, he said. And he asked why the government didn't contact Khobragade to say she would be arrested and give her the chance to come in. ""We do self-surrenders all the time with defendants in New York,"" Arshack said. Instead, she was arrested after dropping off her daughter at school. ""This is muscle flexing,"" Arshack complained. The diplomat's detention was handled by the U.S. Marshals Service, not New York police. Bharara defended the handling of the arrest and custody though his office was not involved. ""Khobragade was accorded courtesies well beyond what other defendants, most of whom are American citizens, are accorded,"" he said Wednesday. ""She was not, as has been incorrectly reported, arrested in front of her children. The agents arrested her in the most discreet way possible, and unlike most defendants, she was not then handcuffed or restrained."" In addition, she was allowed to keep her phone and make calls to arrange personal matters, including child care, he said. ""Because it was cold outside, the agents let her make those calls from their car and even brought her coffee and offered to get her food. It is true that she was fully searched by a female deputy marshal -- in a private setting -- when she was brought into the U.S. Marshals' custody, but this is standard practice for every defendant, rich or poor, American or not, in order to make sure that no prisoner keeps anything on his person that could harm anyone, including himself. This is in the interests of everyone's safety. ""There can be no plausible claim that this case was somehow unexpected or an injustice,"" Bharara said. ""In fact, the Indian government itself has been aware of this legal issue, and that its diplomats and consular officers were at risk of violating the law. The question then may be asked: Is it for U.S. prosecutors to look the other way, ignore the law and the civil rights of victims... or is it the responsibility of the diplomats and consular officers and their government to make sure the law is observed?"" One aspect of this case that's in dispute involves the question of what level of immunity Khobragade is entitled to, the circumstances of her arrest and Richard's actions during her employment. Opinion: What about the nanny? Calls for an apology . It remained unclear Thursday whether U.S. and Indian officials would be able to find a way out of the diplomatic tangle. Kerry's expression of regret was featured prominently on the front page of leading Indian newspapers on Thursday. Commentators and government officials debated whether his comments went far enough. ""An apology from America, acceptance of their fault is what we will be satisfied with,"" Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kamal Nath said, according to IBN. As her case plays out in public, Khobragade has been moved to India's Permanent Mission to the United Nations, where she may get full diplomatic immunity, Indian officials say. Richard, meanwhile, has no passport, is living with friends and has been granted temporary legal status that allows her to remain and work in the United States until the matter is resolved, her lawyer Dana Sussman said. Human rights advocates say the allegations against Khobragade highlight the exploitation of domestic workers around the world. ""It's a good sign that authorities are showing they can take mistreatment of domestic workers seriously,"" Nisha Varia of Human Rights Watch said in a blog post Tuesday. ""It sends the message that no employer is above the law."" Debate: Arrest, strip-search of Indian diplomat 'barbaric?' CNN's Tom Watkins, Deborah Feyerick, Elise Labott, Harmeet Shah Singh, Ross Levitt and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Housekeeper's attorney says diplomat's attorney's ""story keeps changing""

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Four aid workers, who were abducted from Kenya's vast Dadaab refugee complex near the Somali border last week, were freed late Sunday during a shootout with kidnappers, a military official said.. Kenya Defense Force soldiers, working with Somali government troops, confronted the abductors after tips from local residents, Col. Cyrus Oguna said. One of the kidnappers was killed, and two escaped when they tried to flee with their hostages. The workers, a Norwegian, Pakistani, Filipino and Canadian, were taken to a military base in Dhobley, Somalia, he said. Although none of them were hurt in Sunday's gunfight, the Pakistani was shot in the leg during the kidnapping and underwent surgery at the base. Details on his condition were not immediately available. Several days on the run took its toll on the workers. ""They were tired, fatigued, hungry and unwell,"" Oguna said. ""The kidnappers were making them walk during the night and hide during the day."" All work for the Norwegian Refugee Council, a European aid group. ""The Norwegian Refugee Council is relieved and pleased to confirm that our four abducted colleagues are found and released,"" according to the global humanitarian agency's website. The aid group said the workers' families have been notified and more information will be released later. The council has released few details about the kidnappings. ""In our experience with these types of incidents, the less information we provide on the identity of those abducted, the better,"" agency spokesman Rolf Vestvik said Friday. The aid agency said only that a convoy ""was involved in an incident"" in Dadaab and that Secretary-General Elisabeth Rasmusson and Country Director Hassan Khaire were at the camp but neither was in the convoy. While the four aid workers were taken, their Kenyan driver was killed, police said Friday. Two other staff members were injured and treated at a hospital in the capital of Nairobi, officials said. A Norwegian Refugee Council vehicle also was taken. Police have not said whether the kidnappers were from Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked group that is fighting to impose Islamic law in Somalia and controls large parts of the troubled nation. Kenya has blamed previous abductions of tourists and aid workers on Al-Shabaab. In September, armed bandits broke into a beachfront cottage where Britons Judith and David Tebbutt, both in their 50s, were staying. David Tebbutt was shot dead while trying to resist the attack. His wife was grabbed and spirited away on a speedboat. She was released months later in Somalia after her family paid a ransom. In October, pirates made another cross-border raid, this time snatching a French woman in her 60s, who used a wheelchair and was believed to be in bad health, from a holiday home on Manda Island, where she lived part of the year. She later died, likely because of the kidnappers' refusal to give her medicine, according to the French Foreign Ministry. Also in October, gunmen abducted two Spanish workers with the medical charity Doctors Without Borders from Dadaab, the world's largest refugee camp, which houses nearly 500,000 people about 50 miles west of the Somali border. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph and Journalist Lillian Leposo contributed to this report.","NEW: A shootout frees the four aid workers, the Kenyan military says .

"(CNN) -- Anti-terror police in Denmark say they have arrested two brothers, one of whom trained at a terror camp in Somalia. The pair is suspected of ""planning a terrorist act by, among other activities, having discussed the method, the target and the weapon types to be used,"" the Danish Security and Intelligence Service, known as PET, said late Monday. ""PET believes that a specific act of terrorism has been averted,"" the agency said. The Somali-Danish men are due to appear in court on Tuesday. One was arrested as he flew into Copenhagen airport and the other was seized at his residence in the city of Aarhus, the security force said. The brothers, 18 and 23, are Danish citizens of Somali origin who have lived in the Aarhus region for 16 years, PET said, without naming them.","The suspects are Somali-born brothers believed to have been planning an attack .

"(CNN) -- Somalia's Al-Shabaab has brushed aside accusations from Human Rights Watch that the Islamist militia recruits child soldiers, saying that Islam considers people to be adults from the age of 15. ""The allegations from Human Rights Watch say that Al-Shabaab recruits young children at the age of 14, 15 and 17 as soldiers. In Islam, a person becomes adult at the age of 15 so he or she must do what all other adults have to do,'' said Abu Musab, the group's military spokesman. ''If the territories of the Muslims are attacked, it is incumbent on the women and children to take up arms to fight the enemies, so we don't care what Human Rights Watch says,'' Abu Musab said, speaking to Alfurqan radio, which supports the group. Islamic scholars consider a boy becomes a man at 15, or even younger if signs of puberty appear before then. Human Rights Watch said this week that children as young as 10 increasingly face horrific abuse in war-torn Somalia as Al-Shabaab targets them to replenish its diminishing ranks of fighters. The Somali insurgent group's recruitment of child soldiers is not new, but the report said the scale of child abductions over the past two years is like nothing documented in the past. Shocking patterns have also emerged of children serving as human shields on the battlefields, according to the Human Rights Watch report released Tuesday. ""We're beginning to see more and more instances where children are essentially being used as cannon fodder,"" Tirana Hassan of Human Rights Watch told CNN. The head of the Somali national army, Gen. Abdulkadir Ali Diini, said Wednesday the government does its best not to recruit children as soldiers. The government has discharged children who are mistakenly recruited, he told journalists in Mogadishu. Human Rights Watch charged in its report that Al-Shabaab fighters abduct young girls and boys from their homes or schools, in some cases taking entire classes. Children can be sent out to recruit other children, according to the organization. One survivor told Human Rights Watch a group of kids asked him to play football at a nearby field. When he arrived, he and others were gathered up and sent to training camps, the survivor told Human Rights Watch. The camps are places where children live in fear, said Hassan, an emergencies researcher for the international human rights group. ""They see injured and dead fighters, many of them children, coming back from the battlefield,"" Hassan added. Recruits are taught to use weapons and to throw hand grenades and are subjected to a myriad of abuses, including rape, assault and forced marriages, according to Hassan. Dozens of recruits, mostly ages 14 to 17, are driven by truckloads to the front line, where they are told to jump out -- only to be mowed down by gunfire while Al-Shabaab fighters launch rockets from behind, according to Hassan. A 15-year-old boy recruited by Al-Shabaab from his school in Mogadishu in 2010 told Human Rights Watch that ""out of all my classmates -- about 100 boys -- only two of us escaped, the rest were killed."" ""The children were cleaned off. The children all died and the bigger soldiers ran away,"" the youth told Human Rights Watch. Human Rights Watch also criticized Somalia's transitional government for not ending its use of child soldiers. ""Al-Shabaab's horrific abuses do not excuse Somalia's Transitional Federal Government,"" said Zama Coursen-Neff, the group's deputy children's rights director. ""The TFG should live up to its commitments to stop recruiting and using children as soldiers, and punish those who do."" The 104-page report, released two days ahead of a Somalia conference hosted by the British government, grimly details countless violations against children based on more than 160 interviews conducted over two years with Somali youngsters who escaped from Al-Shabaab forces as well as parents and teachers who fled to Kenya. ""For children of Somalia, nowhere is safe,"" Coursen-Neff said. On Thursday, senior representatives from more than 40 governments will converge on London in a diplomatic push to find political solutions to restore stability in Somalia.

"(CNN) -- Freed hostages Jessica Buchanan and Poul Thisted arrived at a U.S. base in Sicily Thursday, a day after being rescued in a U.S. military raid in Somalia, a spokesman for the base said. The pair are now at Naval Air Station Sigonella, said the base's public affairs officer, Lt. Tim Page. U.S. special operations forces parachuted into Somalia from airplanes in the early hours of Wednesday morning, then advanced on foot to a compound where the two kidnapped international aid workers were being held and freed them, U.S. officials said. The nine gunmen holding the hostages were killed, the officials said. Kidnappers seized Buchanan, 32, and Thisted, 60, on October 25 in the central Somali town of Galkayo after they visited humanitarian projects there, said the Danish Refugee Council, the agency for which they work. Neither was harmed, the aid group said. Buchanan was going through what the U.S. military called ""Phase II"" reintegration of former hostages, according to a senior defense official. In most cases, the former hostage will undergo ""more complete medical exams and formal, structured debriefings,"" the official said. ""An inherent and critical part of the reintegration process is the decompression period that has been established to maximize returnee health and welfare,"" the official said. ""This process normally requires a minimum of 72 hours to be effective."" CNN has learned Buchanan's father, John, will go to Sicily to see her. She is not in custody and can leave when she wants but, if she stays, when ready she will be returned to the United States, probably in a U.S. military aircraft. President Barack Obama phoned John Buchanan to tell him Jessica had been freed, Buchanan said, adding that the call had left him ""flabbergasted."" ""He said, 'John, this is Barack Obama. I'm calling because I have great news for you. Your daughter has been rescued by our military,'"" Buchanan said. Buchanan said the operation left him with an overwhelming sense of patriotism. ""I'm extremely proud and glad to be an American,"" he said. ""I didn't know this was going to transpire. I'm glad it did."" He said Jessica was ""doing well, under the circumstances."" Somalia's transitional government welcomed the U.S. military operation Thursday. The rescue of the aid workers ""is a great joy to the Somali government and to all Somalis as well as to all right thinking people everywhere,"" the government said in a statement. ""Hitting them hard is the only language kidnappers of innocent people, pirates and terrorists understand, and every opportunity should be taken to wipe out this scourge from our country,"" the government said. The new United Nations envoy to Somalia -- the first permanent U.N. representative there in 17 years -- also expressed understanding about the military operation. ""If negotiations fail, all means must be applied, including rescue operations,"" Augustine Mahiga said Thursday, even as he urged that lives be protected ""on both sides."" Thisted's sister and brother-in-law wept for joy when they heard he had been rescued, the brother-in-law, Svend Rask, told Denmark's TV2. ""She was overjoyed when she told us what happened,"" Rask said, speaking of the daughter who gave them the news. Students at the school in Kenya where Buchanan used to teach also cried at the news, the dean of students there said. ""Yesterday was an exciting day for us. There were tears of joy on campus,"" said Rob Beyer of Rosslyn Academy, a Christian international school in Nairobi. Beyer remembered Buchanan, who taught at the school from 2007 to 2009, as ""adventurous and a bit of a risk taker"" as well as ""an incredible teacher, well loved."" The Navy SEAL unit that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden last year in Pakistan participated in the rescue mission, a U.S. official said, without specifying whether any of the same individuals were on both assaults. The SEALs are part of the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, formerly known as SEAL Team Six. The special operations forces took fire as they fought their way into the compound where the hostages were held, the official said, adding the troops believed the kidnappers were shooting. The official is not authorized to speak to the media and asked not to be named. Pentagon spokesman George Little said the rescue team included special operations troops from different branches of the military, but would not specify the branches. There were no known survivors among the kidnappers, he added. The American assault team did not suffer any casualties, the Pentagon said. The United States was in close contact with Denmark before, during and after the raid, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. White House spokesman Jay Carney said, ""The decision to go ahead with this rescue mission was made because there was information concerning the deteriorating health of Ms. Buchanan, as well as a window of opportunity to execute this mission."" Obama, who had given the go-ahead at 9 p.m. Monday, was updated on its progress throughout Tuesday, Carney said. At the State of the Union address, before news broke of the rescue, Obama told Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, ""Leon, good job tonight. Good job tonight."" The hostages were safe at that point, but the mission was not yet complete, as the American assault team had not departed Somalia, Little said. In a written statement, Obama thanked the special operations forces for their ""extraordinary courage and capabilities."" ""The United States will not tolerate the abduction of our people, and will spare no effort to secure the safety of our citizens and to bring their captors to justice,"" Obama said. ""This is yet another message to the world that the United States of America will stand strongly against any threats to our people."" Capt. John Kirby, another Pentagon spokesman, said the abductors were ordinary criminals. ""They were kidnappers. We don't have any indication that they were connected to any terrorist group or ideological group at that point,"" he said. ""They were not Al-Shabaab,"" Little said, referring to the al Qaeda-linked Islamist militia that holds sway over parts of Somalia. The area where the hostages were seized is known as a hub for pirates, rather than an area of Islamic militant activity. A number of high-profile abductions of foreigners have occurred in Somalia and in Kenya, close to the largely lawless Somali border. Some of the kidnappings have been blamed on Al-Shabaab, while criminals seeking ransoms seem to have carried out others. The U.S. raid comes nearly three years after Navy snipers killed three pirates who had taken hostage the captain of the Maersk Alabama off Somalia. But the forceful U.S. responses may not do much to deter hostage-takers in largely lawless Somalia, one expert said, pointing out that piracy in particular is extremely lucrative. ""The returns are so worth it that piracy will continue to be attractive to a lot of people,"" said Adjoa Anyimadu, a researcher for the Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. ""I don't think pirates necessarily have the knowledge to target U.S citizens in particular, but obviously U.S. and European citizens can command higher ransoms,"" she said. Somalia Report, a website that tracks piracy statistics, said over $150 million was paid out in ransoms in 2011. Successful pirate attacks on merchant vessels began to drop off in 2011 in face of improved shipping security -- including on board armed security detachments - and stronger action from the foreign navies patrolling the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. The International Maritime Bureau, which tracks piracy, said the number of attacks had risen but the success rate had plummeted to 12% in the first nine months of 2011. The aid workers were part of the Danish Refugee Council's de-mining unit, which aims to make civilians safe from landmines and unexploded ordnance. Buchanan has been employed as a regional education adviser with the mine clearance unit of DRC since May; Thisted, a community safety manager with the de-mining unit, has been working in Somaliland and Somalia since June 2009.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- The leaders of Kenya, Somalia and Uganda held a closed-door meeting in Nairobi Wednesday, reaffirming their commitment to military operations against the Islamic militant group Al-Shabaab in Somalia. Presidents Mwai Kibaki, Sheikh Sharif Ahmed and Yoweri Museveni met for several hours in the Kenyan capital at State House, Kibaki's official residence. In a joint communique after the meeting, the leaders ""expressed confidence that the joint Kenya-Somali operation presents the region with a historic opportunity to restore stability and security in Somalia,"" Kenya's foreign minister said. Kenyan forces entered Somalia in October after a rash of kidnappings Kenyan authorities blamed on Al-Shabaab, which has ties to al Qaeda and is considered a terrorist group by the United States. Kenyan officials say the kidnappings threatened security and constituted an attack on Kenyan sovereignty. Kenyan forces are ultimately seeking to take the Somali port city of Kismayo, described by the United Nations as a key stronghold and source of cash for Al-Shabaab. But after more than a month, Kenya's operation has seen little direct conflict with Al-Shabaab, and has been beset with logistical delays. However, military officials remain confident they will be able to disable the group in southern Somalia. Last month, Ahmed had questioned the wisdom of a Kenyan military incursion into Somali territory, but he has since said that he supports the operation. The African Union-backed AMISOM force, meanwhile, is trying to consolidate power for Somalia's weak transitional federal government in Mogadishu, where Al-Shabaab is especially active in its battle against that government. Uganda is the largest contributor of forces to AMISOM, and the three presidents called on other African countries that have pledged troops, but have yet to act, to ""urgently fulfill their pledges."" Most security analysts believe that more troops are needed for AMISOM to expand its reach of control. While not much of substance was made public from the presidents' meeting, it was symbolically significant, with the three leaders standing together next to their flags in a show of unity.","The presidents are confident the operation against Al-Shabaab will restore security .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Kenyan soldiers, as part of African Union forces in Somalia, captured the key Al-Shabaab-controlled town of Afmadow on Wednesday, according to a Kenyan Defence Force spokesman. ""We now control Afmadow with our troops,"" Maj. Emmanuel Chirchir told CNN. The operation started early Wednesday, he said, with KDF forces capturing the town of Hayo. Six Al-Shabaab militants were killed in that operation. ""(The troops) then moved straight onto Afmadow,"" said Chirchir. Military analysts believe that Afmadow is a key step in Kenya's campaign against Al-Shabaab, the Islamic militant group they have been fighting since they entered Somalia in October of last year. The town would serve as a staging point for any move on Kismayo, Al-Shabaab's stronghold in southern Somalia. ""Afmadow is an important administrative town that was supplying Al-Shabaab fighters with money. It was their nerve center,"" said Chirchir. ""After the fall of Amfadow there is only Kismayo."" Last week, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) said it, along with Somali troops, had launched an offensive against militants in the Afgoye corridor, a densely-populated enclave near the volatile Somali capital of Mogadishu. The corridor, which has been controlled by the al Qaeda-backed Al-Shabaab, is populated with one of the largest populations of internally displaced people. The African Union said the militants have blocked many aid agencies from operating in the area. The campaign was ""going well,"" AMISOM spokesman, Lt. Col. Paddy Nkunda said last week. ""Al-Shabaab tried to fight, but they know they are about to lose Afgoye and our soldiers broke through their early resistance."" Al-Shabaab announced in February that it was tightening its ties to al Qaeda. It has long been considered a terrorist movement by the United States. Al-Shabaab has waged an insurgency against Somalia's feeble Transitional Federal Government since 2007, but has suffered recent setbacks in its heartland in southern Somalia. AMISOM and government forces drove Al-Shabaab fighters from the center of Mogadishu last year, while Kenyan troops crossed into southern Somalia in October to hit back for a rash of kidnappings it blamed on the group. Despite their efforts, however, Al-Shabaab has continued to launch terror attacks in the capital. In a second operation, 14 Al-Shabaab militants were killed and 10 others injured Tuesday when a Kenyan Defense Forces naval ship engaged with militants at an Al-Shabaab seaport watch station, the KDF said. ""The incident occurred when a KDF naval ship was conducting routine sea patrol in the vicinity of (the) port of Kismayu,"" according to a KDF statement. Two on-shore structures were destroyed, officials said. Elsewhere, in Fafadun, 20 Al-Shabaab militants surrendered to KDF, officials said.","Kenyan troops now control Afmadow, an official says .

"(CNN) -- Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, delivering Thursday's commencement speech at Harvard University, criticized what he described as a disturbing trend of liberals silencing voices ""deemed politically objectionable."" ""This spring, it has been disturbing to see a number of college commencement speakers withdraw -- or have their invitations rescinded -- after protests from students and -- to me, shockingly -- from senior faculty and administrators who should know better,"" Bloomberg said. The billionaire former mayor cited an October speech during which his ex-police commissioner, Ray Kelly, was shouted down by students at Brown University. The university canceled Kelly's speech when protesters opposed to the police department's stop-and-frisk policy shouted down and interrupted Kelly. Bloomberg noted other universities have had speakers back out. He pointed to Rutgers, where former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice withdrew amid protests, and Smith College, where International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde withdrew after a student petition. ""In each case, liberals silenced a voice -- and denied an honorary degree -- to individuals they deemed politically objectionable. This is an outrage,"" Bloomberg said to applause. An even more glaring example of failing to listen to the opposing side, Bloomberg said, was the longstanding impasse between Republicans and Democrats in Washington, where every major question facing the nation is decided ""not by engaging with one another but by trying to shout each other down."" Bloomberg, who in April pledged $50 million to gun control groups he helped organize, spoke about Washington politicians' handling of gun issues, noting Congress has barred the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from conducting studies of gun violence, a prohibition that was recently extended to the National Institute of Health. ""What are they afraid of?"" he asked. The Senate this year delayed a vote on President Obama's nominee for surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, because the Harvard physician ""had the audacity to say gun violence is a public health crisis that should be tackled,"" Bloomberg said to applause. ""Let's get serious: When 85 Americans are killed with guns every single day, and shootings regularly occur at our schools and universities, including last week's tragedy at Santa Barbara, it would be almost medical malpractice to say anything else,"" Bloomberg said. The former mayor, who received honorary degrees from Harvard along with seven others -- including former President George H.W. Bush and music icon Aretha Franklin -- spoke of the role of universities as places where people of all backgrounds and beliefs can freely debate ideas without that ""sacred trust"" being threatened by the ""tyrannical tendencies of monarchs, mobs and majorities."" He recalled when protesters came out several years ago against the development of a mosque a few blocks from ground zero in lower Manhattan. ""We protected their right to protest,"" Bloomberg said. ""But they could not have been more wrong. And we refused to cave in to their demands. The idea that government would single out a particular religion, and block its believers -- and only its believers -- from building a house of worship in a particular area is diametrically opposed to the moral principles that gave rise to our great nation, and the constitutional protections that have sustained it."" He added, ""If you want the freedom to worship as you wish, to speak as you wish, and to marry whom you wish, you must tolerate my freedom to do so -- or not do so -- too. What I do may offend you. You may find my actions immoral or unjust. But attempting to restrict my freedoms in ways that you would not restrict your own leads only to injustice."" Bloomberg compared the intolerance of ideas prevalent in the country today to ""McCarthy's Red Scare"" in the 1950s and its destruction of thousands of lives. In the 2012 presidential race, he said, the overwhelming majority of campaign contributions from Ivy League faculty went to Barack Obama. ""Today, on many college campuses, it is liberals trying to repress conservative ideas, even as conservative faculty members are at risk of becoming an endangered species,"" he said. After the speech, Sarah Surrain, who completed her master's degree in education, said Bloomberg was bold to criticize universities as too liberal. ""I thought it was really thoughtful,"" she said of the speech. ""It was nice that it wasn't just platitudes."" Harvard Law School graduate Jared Nicholson said the speech was ""a great message ... about tolerance of different ideas and diversity of opinions."" Greg Silverberg, an engineering school graduate, said he welcomed the former mayor's viewpoint. ""He gave some interesting perspectives on conservative views in universities that I hadn't heard before coming from a liberal undergraduate institution myself,"" he said. ""It was eye-opening for a lot of people."" Before the speech, Cary Williams, president of the Association of Black Harvard Women, questioned why Bloomberg was selected as speaker, because, she said, the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program ""disproportionately has targeted people of color in New York."" ""It's basically racial profiling,"" junior Keyanna Wigglesworth said of the New York policing policy under Bloomberg. ""And so it's unsettling to me, (for) someone to speak who advocates a racist policy when you want students of color on campus to feel comfortable. It's confusing and I don't think its what Harvard stands for."" CNN's Laura Dolan and Dana Garrett contributed to this report.","Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg blasts what he calls silencing of ideas .

"(CNN) -- It's crazy golf on an insane scale -- a putting green swimming in a giant bowl of noodles and chopsticks, the Great Wall of China for a hazard, a fairway threading through Mayan ruins and a panda-themed hole. China is getting into golf in a big way ahead of the sport's reintroduction to the Olympics in 2016, and even its take on the mini version of the game is larger than life. ""Traditionalists will probably hate it,"" says design guru Brian Curley, principal partner in Schmidt-Curley, the company behind the 22 courses that make up the Mission Hills complex in Hainan Island. ""But this is real golf, with real clubs on real fairways,"" he told CNN. Just about everyone has tried their hand at crazy or mini-golf, a scale-down variant of the game which has the ability to delight and infuriate in equal measure. Usually situated at seaside resorts or other leisure locations, the prerequisites for success are a modicum of actual golfing skill, the ability to putt in a straight line or at unlikely angles off prominent obstacles -- and a large slice of luck. President Barack Obama, who takes every opportunity to hit the fairways when not leading the Western world, even tried his hand at crazy golf while on holiday with his family in Florida in 2010. Making a par on his opening hole, he then had to watch as his nine-year-old daugher Sasha made a hole in one, besting her dad in front of the gathered ranks of the world's media. Obama might well be tempted to put his handicap on the line at the ground-breaking new course being constructed at Curley's Mission Hills Haikou development. Combining the wacky elements of mini-golf with the ""grown-up"" version of the game, the proposed 18-hole layout would leave little chance of aces by nine-year-olds -- but still plenty of chances of humiliation for the average golfer. Fantasy golf . Mindful of the impression that there is a ""sameness"" to the courses being churned out in their droves in the fastest expanding golf market in the world, Curley and his team wanted to come up with something that he felt would appeal to the wider Chinese public and other visitors to the resort. So instead of bunkers, rough and trees, the players will be faced with a replica of the Great Wall of China winding its way the length of a 400-meter par four hole. It also has a hole to rival the infamous ""island green"" seen at TPC Sawgrass in Florida, home of the the U.S. PGA Tour's Players Championship. That tricky 17th sees the best in the world attempt to hit their ball onto a tiny green surrounded by water, and spectators delight in seeing the likes of Tiger Woods find the lake. At Mission Hills' new course, set to open in 2014, the water is replaced by an 80-meter wide noodle bowl with 50-meter giant chopsticks. Standing on the tee, players will not know whether to laugh or cry, and the degree of difficulty may not end there. Tiger Woods eyes long rivalry with McIlroy . Wind machine . Curley is promising the addition of ""man made"" gale force winds on each tee, adjustable depending on the standards of the players and available by hitting a red button. There is a par-5 threading its way through Mayan ruins, while another green is created in the image of the ""Birds Nest"" Olympic Stadium in Beijing. Another hole is styled after China's favorite animal, the panda bear. On a conventional golf course, the degree of difficulty is often dictated by which tee the player chooses to play from. Leading professionals play from the tees furthest from the hole, while higher handicappers can opt to hit their first shot from much closer. On the Chinese fantasy course, one of the par-3s will give golfers the choice of hitting their ball onto a tiny green surrounded by lava rocks. In true mini-golf fashion, the other easier option at the volcano theme hole will let players hit towards a mound from which the ball will be whisked nearer the hole down a pipe. Curley and his team needed the permission of the owners of the complex before committing to the costly project, but Mission Hills' chairman Dr. Ken Chu is an enthusiastic backer. ""This will be a fun alternative for families, novices and children on holiday,"" he was quoted in the Asian edition of Golf Course Industry International. Only time will tell if Chu's faith in the project proves founded, but the Mission Hills group has already established itself as a host venue of leading professional tournaments. Last year the Hainan Island development staged the World Cup teams event for the first time, taking over from the Mission Hills complex at Shenzhen. This year Shenzhen was the venue of the prestigious HSBC-World Golf Championship event, won by Englishman Ian Poulter. The Ryder Cup hero conquered the conventional bunker-bound Olazabal course in 21 under par, but knowing Poulter's reputation as a golfing trendsetter, he will probably be itching to test his mettle on Curley's new wacky creation at the first opportunity.

"(CNN) -- Traditionally, hotels are built with the hope they'll have staying power. For a new breed of accommodation, however, long-term is passe. The last two years has seen a proliferation in the number of pop-up hotels -- housed in anything from tepees to old shipping containers. Many are making their way in places traditionally off-limits for traditional hotels. Mark Sorrill, the founder of the UK-based The Pop-Up Hotel, has set up accommodation in the form of luxury tents (and in some cases yurts, shepherd huts and Airstream mobile homes) at some of England's most spectacular properties. In August, for example, he's partnering with Heritage England and moving his operation on the grounds of the Osborne Estate, a sprawling 19th century manor that was built as a summer residence for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. ""As lovely as conventional hotels can be, they are effectively a series of boxes stacked on top of each other, insulating guests from the environment. I wanted to throw this whole concept up into the air and see how it fell,"" he says. ""I wanted to create a hotel that could really connect with the environment where it was positioned."" Infographic: The price of business travel . The Pop-Up Hotel is also popular on the festival circuit. In fact, the first one launched at Glastonbury, the UK's largest music festival, two years ago. Then, it only offered 20 rooms. This year, its rolled out 130, and was fully booked. ""Guests seem to really appreciate that if you were to come and stay with us again in a different location, it would be a different holiday experience,"" he says. Booking isn't necessarily cheap -- tents at the four-day Glastonbury festival start at $1,525. At the same time, just because the walls are canvas doesn't mean you'd be roughing it. Concierge and porter service is usually part of the package and, depending on the event, there are usually accompanying restaurant, bar and spa tents. The concept is gaining traction. Snoozebox is another company that offers portable accommodation, often pegged to major events, such as the London Olympics last year and the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in June this year. Snoozebox's rooms are set up in shipping containers, making them easy to transport. That they're self-contained means they have climate control options, an advantage over The Pop-Up Hotel. China's high-speed trains attract frustrated fliers . One of the most inventive pop-up concepts, however, hasn't been officially launched yet. It is the brainchild of Copenhagen-based architecture firm Pink Cloud, and last month it won the Radical Innovation in Hospitality Award. The company is hoping to simultaneously address two pressing issues plaguing many urban landscapes: vacated office space and insufficient hotel vacancies. The collective, which is made up of partners Eric Tan, Leon Lai and Nico Schlapps, is hoping to make New York its launching point. Tan points out that the office vacancy rate in the city is alarmingly high at 26%. ""Tenants would rather wait for new high rises to be built than rent the ones leftover from the '60s and '70s, which, unfortunately, the city has a lot of,"" he explains. ""The ceilings are low and the stock seems outdated to potential tenants."" Meanwhile, New York's hotel occupancy rate is at 96% -- almost full capacity. Pink Cloud's solution is to create temporary hotels in empty office buildings. That way, tourists get a place to sleep for the night and the building owner can finally pull in some rent. Watch: reinventing the hotel breakfast . An entire hotel could fit into 36 boxes, enough to fill a single lorry. When unpacked, they would contain all the makings of a modern hotel room, including beds, sofas, toilets, partitions, plus elements to craft night clubs, restaurants -- even a pool, if requested. ""A traditional hotel can take five to six years to build, from start to finish. With the pop-up hotel, we see it taking two to four weeks,"" says Tan. The beauty of the project, says Lai, is its flexibility. ""If you were to set up in Miami, you could bring indoor swimming pools. In Manhattan, guests might want to watch a boxing match. We could bring in a temporary boxing ring. It all depends on the city and the public,"" he says. The price point, they're imagining, would also be considerably lower. The average New York City hotel room is $350 a night. Pink Cloud's rooms, meanwhile, would clock in around $130. The company is currently scoping out partners to make the concept a reality. The way Pink Cloud sees it, the hotel could be a savvy marketing stunt for the right brand. For example, says Tan, a major fashion label could use the Pink Cloud model to promote itself during fashion week. ""There's no reason you couldn't have the Prada pop-up, or the Diesel pop-up,"" he says.","The last two years have seen an increase in pop-up hotel chains .
Unlike traditional hotels, these can set up at festivals and special events .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- At the stroke of midnight Sunday, Pakistan made history. It marked the first time a democratically-elected government served a full five-year term in the country's 65-year history. In its short existence, Pakistan has experienced three military coups, been ruled by generals for half its life, and it remains mired in near-constant political turmoil. ""Despite all the odds, completion of the term is an extraordinary and historic achievement,"" Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf said in an address to the nation Saturday night. Ashraf said his country has a long history of confrontation between democratic and nondemocratic forces, but that democracy has now notched a victory. In the next few days, a caretaker government will be put in place to oversee the country through its next elections scheduled for May. Success at a price . While the five-year term completion is a milestone well worth nothing, it has come with a price. The ruling Pakistan Peoples Party rode to power on the back of a populace disillusioned with then-President Pervez Musharraf's policies that led to shortage of essential food items, power cuts and a skyrocketing inflation. Pakistanis also disapproved of the way Musharraf carried out his end of the ""war on terror"" -- and used it as a crutch to explain away many of his unpopular moves. And the nation was collectively mourning the death of PPP leader Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated just months before the . last elections in February 2008. Very few held out hope the PPP would resolve the many problems that plagued Pakistan. And throughout its five-year term, it seemed it couldn't. Minister after minister were tainted with accusations of corruption. The power outages and food shortages that Pakistanis complained about remain. Terror attacks in city centers continued with depressing regularity. Violence directed at the Shiite minority reached new heights. And Pakistanis called the government stooges of the United States, while Washington grumbled that Pakistan was not doing enough to confront militants. Through it all, the shaky coalition the PPP cobbled together seemed on the verge of collapse every few months as partners threatened to walk away at the slightest disagreement. ""We could not provide rivers of milk and honey but tried our best to alleviate the country's problems,"" Ashraf said in his Saturday speech. Staying the course . But credit goes to two factors that helped the government stay the course: . The military was content to sit on the sidelines through the topsy-turvy turns -- even when it seemed that the widening rift with the government would force it to intervene as it has in the past. And President Asif Ali Zardari -- Bhutto's widower -- proved surprisingly agile at survival. Three years ago, he handed over much of his power to the prime minister -- and in the process, robbed his critics of the accusation that he was amassing power like his predecessor. He also transferred some power from the central government to the provincial level. Musharraf's return . Against this backdrop comes news that Musharraf plans to return to Pakistan from self-imposed exile in the United Arab Emirates, and lead his party in upcoming elections. Musharraf plans to fly on a commercial airline into Karachi on March 24, then attend a rally with 50,000 people, including more than 200 Pakistani expatriates from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates, he said in a statement. Five years is often enough time for a populace to forgive and forget. It remains to be seen whether Pakistan, now soured by PPP's reign, welcomes him back with open arms. CNN's Nasir Habib reported from Islamabad; Saeed Ahmed wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Saima Mohsin also contributed.","Pakistan has had three military coups .

"(CNN) -- Infectious disease experts say they wouldn't be surprised if a new virus that's sickened 12 people and killed six shows up in the United States. The first cases of the novel coronavirus, which is in the same family as SARS and the common cold, were found to have occurred in an Amman, Jordan, hospital in April, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People have also become infected in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. On Saturday, the World Health Organization announced a new case in the United Kingdom -- the third case confirmed this month, all in the same family. One of those three people has died, Britain's Health Protection Agency said Tuesday. ""This patient had an underlying condition that may have made them more susceptible to respiratory infections,"" the agency said in a statement. The person died Sunday in Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham's critical care unit, the hospital said. ""The patient was already an outpatient at QEHB, undergoing treatment for a long-term, complex unrelated health condition,"" the hospital said. ""The patient was immuno-compromised and is believed to have contracted the virus from a relative who is being treated for the condition in a Manchester hospital."" The first patient, who had traveled recently to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, was being treated, the Health Protection Agency said. The third case had ""a mild illness"" and has recovered. ""I wouldn't be shocked if it came here,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. Dr. Susan Gerber, a medical epidemiologist in the CDC's Division of Viral Diseases, agreed. ""It could happen,"" she said. ""That's why the CDC is working closely with the World Health Organization and other international partners."" The CDC has advised doctors to ask patients with certain symptoms about their recent travels. Symptoms of infection with the novel coronavirus include an acute respiratory infection, fever and a cough. The new virus, which the WHO is calling NCoV, or novel coronavirus, has a range of effects, including potential pneumonia and kidney failure as seen in the United Kingdom. ""Once it gets you, it's a very serious infection,"" Schaffner said. Fortunately, he added, the virus is ""very difficult to acquire."" New SARS-like virus posts medical mystery . So far most of the people who've caught the virus have been in the Middle East. It's suspected that, like SARS, the virus originated in animals. A study published in November found that genetically, the new coronavirus was most closely related to viruses found in bats. In all but two cases, the virus has not spread from person to person. And in most cases, patients have not infected family members. Health care workers taking care of infected patients have also not become ill. ""There is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission where you see a chain of many cases going person to person to person,"" Gerber said. ""People shouldn't freak out,"" she added. ""There's no evidence that this virus is easily spread, say, across a room."" However, human-to-human transmission is not impossible, as seen in the United Kingdom cases. Two family members in the United Kingdom contracted the virus without traveling to the Mideast but lived with the third, who traveled to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, according to the WHO. ""In these cases, human-to-human transmission does seem likely,"" Gerber said.","NEW: A sixth person has died from a new SARS-like virus .

"VAVUNIYA, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- After visiting a displacement camp in Sri Lanka on Saturday and flying over the site of the last battle in the country's recently ended civil war, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called the sites ""appalling."" Internally displaced Sri Lankan watch through barbed wire during a visit by the U.N. secretary-general. ""I have traveled around the world and visited similar places, but this is by far the most appalling scenes I have seen,"" Ban told CNN. ""I sympathize fully with all of the displaced persons."" Ban called for better humanitarian aid after interviewing some of the people regarding shortages of water and medicine. Ban toured Manik Farm, a sprawling camp for internally displaced people in the country's north, days after Sri Lanka declared victory in a 25-year civil war against the Tamil Tigers rebels. About 250,000 to 300,000 people are refugees in the country, according to humanitarian groups and U.N. figures. Some in the camp have experienced fierce fighting in recent months, saying they did not believe at points that they were going to survive. ""I have seen the complete devastation here, and there must have been in the crossfire many civilian casualties. There simply must have been,"" Ban told CNN's Sara Sidner. The Sri Lankan government has said it doesn't believe many civilians were injured or killed in the fighting. While the war's end elicited celebrations in some parts of the country, humanitarian groups and the United Nations worry over those uprooted by the fighting. Ban arrived in the South Asian island nation Friday, saying he came to offer help and partnership. ""I hope my visit today can help begin a process of national recovery, renewal and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans,"" Ban said in a written statement issued Friday. ""That is why I am here."" Ban met with Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa and asked that humanitarian organizations be given unrestricted access to provide more aid to the displaced. The president seemed open to the idea, Ban said. Ban said earlier he would urge the government to expedite the screening and processing of refugees and ensure that displaced camps have adequate supplies of food, medicine and water. CNN's Sara Sidner contributed to this story.","NEW: Ban Ki-moon says camp contains ""the most appalling scenes I have seen""

"(CNN) -- Amid solemn commemorations on Tuesday's 11th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, President Barack Obama and other leaders emphasized how America has emerged stronger from the devastation that killed more than 2,900 people and forever changed the nation and the world. ""This anniversary allows us to renew our faith that even the darkest night gives way to the dawn,"" Obama said at the Pentagon, where 184 people died when one of four hijacked planes slammed into the iconic building symbolizing U.S. military might. ""As painful as this day is and always will be, it leaves us with a lesson that no single event can ever destroy who we are, no act of terrorism can ever change what we stand for,"" Obama said, adding: ""When the history books are written, the true legacy of 9/11 will not be one of fear or hate or division. It will be a safer world, a stronger nation, and a people more united than ever before."" Earlier, Obama and first lady Michelle Obama stood with heads bowed and hands clasped on the White House lawn to observe a moment of silence at the exact time the first hijacked plane hit New York's World Trade Center in 2001. White House staff stood in quiet observance on the grass behind them as a lone bugler played ""Taps."" Opinion: How we honored our son's memory . At the ground zero site in lower Manhattan, family members and others read the names of the 2,753 people killed there. No politicians were included in the New York ceremony, near a new high-rise tower built where two hijacked planes destroyed the World Trade Center buildings. Obama later went to Arlington National Cemetery. He also was to visit wounded troops at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, while Vice President Joe Biden attended a commemoration near the crash site of another hijacked plane in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. ""What they did for this country is still etched in the minds of not only you, but millions of Americans forever,"" Biden said of passengers on Flight 93 who forced the hijackers to crash the plane believed headed for a suicide attack on the U.S. Capitol. All aboard died. In deeply personal remarks that reflected his own experience of losing his wife and daughter in a 1972 car crash, Biden told family and loved ones of the victims that ""no matter how many anniversaries you experience, for at least an instant, the terror of that moment returns -- the lingering echo of that phone call; that sense of total disbelief that envelops you, where you feel like you're being sucked into a black hole in the middle of your chest."" Neither Obama nor Biden planned any campaign events for the day, even though the November election against Republican challenger Mitt Romney is less than two months away. In a speech Tuesday afternoon to a National Guard Association meeting in Nevada, Romney refrained from his usual political attacks. ""I would normally speak to a gathering like this about the differences between my and my opponent's plans for our military and for our national security,"" the former Massachusetts governor said. ""There is a time and a place for that, but this day is not it."" At the same time, Romney made clear his support for maintaining or increasing defense spending -- an issue on which he has previously criticized Obama. The president's plan to end the war in Afghanistan by the end of 2014 ""must not be used as an excuse to hollow out our military through devastating defense budget cuts,"" Romney said. Before he left for Reno, Romney greeted firefighters and other first responders holding a 9/11 commemoration on the airport tarmac in Chicago. Work resumes on 9/11 museum . At the U.S. Capitol, legislators displayed rare bipartisanship with a united commemoration. Despite the bitter partisan divide that has permeated Congress in recent years, party leaders insisted the nation was more unified in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. ""Americans showed the world how a unified nation can fight back against darkness and fear,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, while his GOP counterpart, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, remembered how legislators gathered on the steps of the Capitol on that day to sing ""God Bless America."" ""It was one of the most uplifting and unifying moments in the history of our country,"" McConnell said of the shared display of patriotism 11 years earlier. ""And I think it is safe to say that we are, as a nation, together even though we have our political differences, together and stronger in the wake of what happened."" At the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, Attorney General Eric Holder honored the memories of the 72 officers who died in the line of duty on September 11, 2001. The names of the 9/11 victims are inscribed together on the memorial, located a few blocks from Capitol Hill, which has a total of 19,660 law enforcement officers carved into it dating back to the earliest known officer fatality in 1791. Dan Rather: Media's balancing act with terrorism . Despite the solemnity of the day, some election-year politics continued. Obama made sure to mention his signature foreign policy achievements, noting that the war in Iraq has ended, the war in Afghanistan is winding down, al Qaeda's leadership is devastated and ""Osama bin Laden will never threaten us again."" After his remarks, he greeted family members of 9/11 victims at the Pentagon and was seen shaking hands with one man wearing a Romney hat. In a post on Twitter, Romney got in an apparent political jab by making sure the words ""under God"" were included. At its national convention last week, the Democratic Party initially omitted the word ""God"" from its platform. ""On this most somber day, America is united under God in its quest for peace and freedom at home and across the world,"" the Romney tweet said. It followed a statement by Romney that his campaign released overnight that initially made no mention of God, then later added a similar ""under God"" reference. ""On this most somber day, those who would attack us should know that we are united, one nation under God, in our determination to stop them and to stand tall for peace and freedom at home and across the world,"" the amended statement said.

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- More than 80 elephants in Zimbabwe have been poisoned with cyanide -- the latest victims of poachers keen to feed soaring global demand for illegally trafficked ivory. Since May, the carcasses of 87 elephants have been discovered in Hwange National Park, said Caroline Washaya-Moyo, public relations manager for Zimbabwe's Parks and Wildlife Management Authority. The poachers poisoned natural salt licks to bring down the mighty beasts, she said Wednesday. The parks authority has so far recovered 51 tusks, she said -- leaving 123 in the hands of the poachers. Zimbabwe's newly appointed Environment Minister Saviour Kasukuwere told CNN that he would push for stiffer jail penalties to root out poaching in the wildlife-rich African nation. ""That will be one of my missions in the new parliament, given the recent case of elephants which were poisoned by poachers,"" said Kasukuwere, who has twice visited the park in recent days to see the impact of the poisoning. Last month authorities arrested five suspected poachers after 41 elephants were found dead in the park, which is about 800 kilometers (500 miles) southwest of Harare, not far from Zimbabwe's border with Zambia. The other carcasses have been discovered since then, Washaya-Moyo said. Three of those arrested have been convicted and are due to be sentenced this week, she said. Two investigations are ongoing. Poaching stinks... and now dogs are sniffing it out . Call for tougher action . The Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force, an anti-poaching organization, said the latest elephant deaths could have been avoided if Harare was tougher on those convicted of poaching. ""They need to be given some extensive jail time. If it was, they wouldn't carry on doing it,"" said the organization's chairman, Johnny Rodrigues. He accused Zimbabwe of not doing enough to clamp down on poachers and of creating an impression that the country had more elephants than it can sustain. ""They want permission from CITES to sell the ivory they have in stock and they think they will get it if there are too many elephants here,"" Rodrigues said, referring to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. CITES, also known as the Washington Convention, aims to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants is kept to a minimum to avoiding threatening their existence. Rodrigues puts the country's elephant population at around 35,000, while Washaya-Moyo said it was about 45,000. The use of cyanide could also have a wider impact, Rodrigues said. ""When other animals and birds feed on the rotting elephant carcasses, they will also die from the poison. Hundreds of animals are now at risk,"" he said. The police suspect there could be more elephant carcasses in the park that have not yet been discovered, he added. The Parks and Wildlife Management Authority warned that wildlife poaching syndicates in Zimbabwe ""have become sophisticated and need appropriate responses to effectively deal with them."" 'Killed in record numbers' The International Fund for Animal Welfare and the WWF conservation group said that a recent surge in the illicit ivory trade has resulted in the killing of 30,000 African elephants annually in recent years. The International Fund for Animal Welfare, which published a major study into the illegal wildlife trade in June, calculates that an elephant loses its life to poaching on average every 15 minutes. ""Elephants were killed for their ivory in record numbers in 2011 and 2012, and some rhinoceros subspecies have become extinct or are on the verge of extinction,"" it said. ""Rangers are regularly killed by poachers, and some of the world's poorest countries continue to see their wildlife decimated for the black market in wild animals and parts. Meanwhile, the profits realized from the illegal trade in wildlife have surged to levels once reserved for legally traded precious metals. ""Criminal and violent groups around the world have become the main actors exploiting this global industry."" Elephants under siege . Demand in Asia, United States . Much of the demand for ivory, as well as rhinoceros horn, is in Asia, and particularly China, where these items are used in traditional medicines and handicraft products, the report said. The United States is widely considered to be the second-largest destination for illegally trafficked wildlife in the world, it said, with the European Union third. Authorities in the United States have spoken out against the illegal trade in recent weeks. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell announced this month that nearly six tons of elephant ivory seized by U.S. wildlife inspectors would be destroyed to highlight the issue. ""Rising demand for ivory is fueling a renewed and horrific slaughter of elephants in Africa, threatening remaining populations across the continent,"" Jewell said. ""We will continue to work aggressively with the departments of Justice and State, as well as with international law enforcement agencies, to disrupt and prosecute criminals who traffic in ivory, and we encourage other nations to join us in that effort."" The ivory stockpile, which includes whole tusks as well as smaller carvings and jewelry, has been kept at a secure site in Colorado, where it will be crushed and destroyed next month. Commercial ivory trade has been banned in the United States since 1989. The Clinton Foundation is also working with conservation groups to try to halt the gruesome trade in tusks, by combating poaching and trafficking, and by educating consumers so they no longer buy ivory. Chelsea Clinton wrote last month that elephant poaching had reached alarmingly high levels -- and was an issue with implications for global society. ""This is not just an ecological disaster; it is an economic and security threat as well,"" she said. ""Tourism, a vital source of income for many of the most-affected African countries, is threatened if wildlife preserves are depopulated. ""The overall black market for illegal wildlife trade has become the fourth most lucrative criminal activity internationally, after drugs, counterfeit goods and human trafficking."" CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London and journalist Columbus S. Mavhunga in Harare.","Poachers have used cyanide to kill more than 80 elephants in Zimbabwe, park official says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- On April 20, President Obama challenged his Cabinet to cut $100 million in spending over the next 90 days. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs says a report on Cabinet spending cuts will be released ""in coming days."" The deadline came -- and went -- without a report from the White House on whether or not that promise was fulfilled. Asked about the spending cuts, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Monday that information still was being compiled. ""Those are being reviewed now, and we'll release something in the coming days,"" Gibbs told the daily White House briefing. At time the challenge was announced, critics said $100 million in savings was a small amount on the context of the federal budget. ""Any amount of savings is obviously welcome,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said in April. ""But [$100 million is] about the average amount we'll spend every single day just covering the interest on the stimulus package that we passed earlier this year."" In April, Gibbs insisted that ordinary Americans nevertheless would appreciate the savings effort. ""Only in Washington, D.C., is $100 million not a lot of money,"" Gibbs said. The issue is a sensitive one for Obama at a time of fierce Republican criticism about increased government spending for the economic stimulus plan. Republicans also oppose health care reform proposals by Democrats that would cost $1 trillion or more over the next 10 years. Obama is pushing for fast congressional action on a health care overhaul.","Obama's April 20 challenge to Cabinet: Cut $100 million in spending in 90 days .

"(CNN) -- In his recent CNN.com opinion piece, ""Net neutrality is foremost free speech issue of our time,"" Sen. Al Franken claims that ""our free speech rights are under assault -- not from the government but from corporations seeking to control the flow of information in America."" He alludes to potential corporate blocking of online products and speech and says, ""If that scares you as much as it scares me, then you need to care about net neutrality."" Chicken Little, call your office! Such sky-is-falling scare tactics are all too common in the heated debate over net neutrality regulation, but actual evidence of such nefarious corporate scheming is nowhere to be found. Perhaps that's why Franken resorts to such tall tales. Moreover, his reading of the First Amendment is at odds with the one most of us learned about in civics class (""Congress shall make no law...""). His would empower regulators by converting the First Amendment from a shield against government action into a sword that bureaucrats could wield against private industry. We should be skeptical of any claims that net neutrality regulation is consistent with the First Amendment, let alone required by it. As First Amendment attorney Robert Corn-Revere has noted (""The First Amendment, the Internet & Net Neutrality: Be Careful What You Wish For""), ""It should not be forgotten that the federal government's initial impulse [in the mid-1990s] was to censor the internet and to subject it to a far lower level of First Amendment protection."" The real ""Big Brother"" threat here is a government with the power to completely foreclose all speech under threat of fine or imprisonment -- a power the private sector lacks even if you buy into the silly notion that it is out to bottle up speech or speakers. And really, why would any company want ""to control the flow of information in America,"" as Franken suggests? First, it's bad for business. There's just no good business case for censorship. Internet service providers make more money by delivering more bits, not fewer. Second, censorship is hard. Internet service providers simply don't have the technology or manpower necessary to effectively filter online content by viewpoint. Third, trying to control information would quickly create public relations nightmares for carriers. There'd be hell for them to pay with the press, industry watchdogs and especially their subscribers. The white-hot spotlight of public attention is the best disinfectant. Finally, any attempt to censor would backfire and actually draw attention to the speech or speaker in question. Simply stated, the internet's First Amendment is the First Amendment -- not some new, top-down, heavy-handed regulatory regime that puts the Federal Communications Commission in control of the digital economy. Net neutrality regulation is also tantamount to a declaration of surrender on broadband competition and a call to return to the era of public utility-style regulation. We shouldn't give up so easily on the idea of facilities-based competition that only got started 14 years ago with the Telecommunications Act of 1996. If broadband providers ever possessed ""gatekeeper"" or ""bottleneck"" power that required regulation, that rationale for regulation no longer exists. The internet has clearly changed the communications landscape, mooting old regulatory ideas once used to justify heavy-handed government regulation of mass media speech and its underlying infrastructure. Today, 95 percent of America has access to robust broadband, and the vast majority can choose from multiple broadband providers (e.g., wire, wireless and satellite technologies). The investment and innovation that's made this possible would never have happened in  Franken's world of heavily regulated infrastructure. Just as certain is the slippery slope of regulation: Neutrality mandates will eventually spread to other layers of the internet to cover content and applications. (The FCC is already hinting at its interest in regulating in the cloud and other internet services and content). Google and Apple's necks may be next on the neutrality chopping block. Corporations go out of business if they no longer serve consumers. The government and its agencies do not. For the former, the combination of technological innovation, consumer education, industry best practices and competitive markets all work to blunt the abuses -- real or imagined -- of broadband providers. But only the Constitution and the Bill of Rights restrain the government. If Al Franken has his way, these roles would be reversed and our government would be empowered to control the most important medium of human expression the world has ever known. We should think twice before going down that path. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the co-authors.","Big government, not big companies, threaten freedom on the web, say co-authors .
They question Sen. Al Franken's argument that ""net neutrality"" is free speech issue of our time .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Nearly two decades after the first Gulf war and six years after Saddam Hussein was removed from power, Iraq still is subject to 73 United Nations resolutions. A March 1991 photo shows burning oil wells in Kuwait damaged by Iraq military forces. Now Iraq's foreign minister says his country ""will not regain full sovereignty and independence without getting rid of these resolutions."" Speaking to reporters in Washington, Hoshyar Zebari said Monday that Iraq has paid ""billions"" of dollars under Chapter 7 of the U.N. sanctions placed on Iraq as a result of the 1990 Iraq invasion of Kuwait and subsequent war. The U.N. Security Council is reviewing the sanctions, and Zebari said he had ""intensive discussions"" in New York with members of the Security Council. He said ""I think the outcome is positive."" ""We felt a great deal of good will that, really, time has come for Iraq to get rid of all these restrictions and to regain its international standing and position as a normal country."" The Iraqi foreign minister said bringing Iraq out of Chapter 7 is an ""American commitment also"" since Iraq signed the status of forces agreement with the United States, which governs the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq, based on its understanding that the U.S. would help Iraq to come out of Chapter 7. Foreign Minister Zebari said the sanctions impose a heavy burden on Iraq -- it continues to pay 5 percent of its oil revenues to Kuwait, down from the initial 30 percent. Iraq's security forces, he told reporters, have ""proven they are capable of defending themselves and the country."" In the next six months, however, he said, the country faces some risks. ""What can be seen as problems could become crises unless this administration keeps its focus and support to push the situation forward; otherwise this overall strategy of responsible redeployment could be undermined."" If that happens, Zebari said, it ""will impact what the U.S. is doing in the Middle East, in the Arab peace process, with Iran, even in Afghanistan because Iraq is such a crucial player in the region.""","Iraq's FM says his country won't be fully independent until U.N. sanctions end .

"(CNN) -- The Syrian government is working constructively with the international team overseeing the destruction of the nation's chemical weapons, the chief of the world's chemical weapons watchdog said Wednesday. Inspectors visited a first site earlier this week, where they saw some chemical weapons equipment destroyed, and are expected to visit more than 20 others over the coming days, said Ahmet Uzumcu, director-general of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. ""The cooperation has been quite constructive, and I will say that the Syrian authorities have been cooperative,"" Uzumcu told reporters at The Hague on Wednesday. Syria: Chemical weapons team faces many dangers, says U.N. chief Ban . His account comes less than two months after an August 21 chemical attack outside Damascus that led to U.S. and allied calls for military intervention in Syria's civil war -- a confrontation that was defused in mid-September, when Damascus agreed to a U.S.-Russian plan to give up its chemical weapons stockpile. A U.N. Security Council resolution gives Syria until mid-2014 to destroy that arsenal, which the United States estimated at about 1,000 tons of blister agents and nerve gas. The Syrians provided an initial declaration of its stockpile and must submit a plan for destroying the weapons by October 27, Uzumcu said. Inspectors must complete their initial inspections of all Syrian chemical weapons and storage facilities by November 1 and complete the eradication of production and chemical mixing facilities, the U.N. resolution states. Uzumcu said inspectors visited a second site Wednesday. Syria's al-Assad says he welcomes return of U.N. inspectors . Inspectors face risks in 'dangerous and volatile' Syria . The timeline is tight and the inspectors face significant challenges, including having to cross front lines and move through areas controlled by militants fighting Syria's government. Uzumcu hinted that if the deadlines are to be met, cooperation from rebels would be key. ""I think the elimination of those weapons is in the interest of all. Therefore, if we can assure some cooperation by all parties and if some temporary cease-fires could be established in order to permit our experts to work in a permissive environment, I think our targets could be reached,"" he said. U.S. officials said at least 1,400 people died in the August 21 attack, which U.N. inspectors determined had been carried out with the nerve agent sarin. The inspectors did not assign blame for the attack, and Syria denied responsibility, pointing the finger at rebel forces. But Washington and its allies have said that details of the report point squarely at government troops. And there has been some skepticism over whether Syria will give up its entire arsenal. A defected Syrian brigadier general, Zaher al-Sakat, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour last week that in addition to four secret locations within Syria, the regime is transferring chemical weapons to Iraq and Lebanon -- an allegation that the commander of the opposition Free Syrian Army, Gen. Salim Idriss, also recently made to Amanpour. Iraq and Lebanon have denied the claims. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the Security Council on Monday that the current inspection team of about 35 will be beefed up to about 100. But he said the inspectors face a ""dangerous and volatile"" environment, particularly in urban areas such as Damascus, Homs and Aleppo. ""Heavy artillery, air strikes, mortar barrages and the indiscriminate shelling of civilians areas are commonplace and battle lines shift quickly,"" Ban said. It will be up to the Syrian government and the United Nations to make sure that inspectors can get to the rebel-held areas, OPCW official Malik Ellahi said Wednesday. Two more French journalists reported kidnapped . Syria's descent into civil war began in March 2011, when the government of Bashar al-Assad cracked down on anti-government demonstrations in the wake of that year's ""Arab Spring"" revolts in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and other countries in the region. The United Nations estimated the conflict had claimed more than 100,000 lives before the August 21 attack. Refugees inside their own country: Syrians continue to suffer . The war has ground on while much of the outside world's attention has been focused on the standoff over chemical weapons, with opposition activists reporting triple-digit death tolls on a daily basis. Syria's government has restricted access by international journalists, making it impossible to verify many of those claims. France announced Wednesday that two French journalists had been kidnapped in Syria, adding to two others whose abductions were reported earlier this year. The June 22 seizure of reporter Nicolas Henin and freelance photographer Pierre Torres had been kept confidential at the request of their families, the Foreign Ministry said. Opinion: Syria problem is not going away . The two other French journalists, reporter Didier Francois and photographer Edouard Elias, have been held in Syria since June 6, the ministry said. The ministry has not said who is holding the journalists, but said ""all means of the state are mobilized"" to free them. Henin was preparing a report for the Le Point news magazine and the Arte media chain, and Torres had been expected to cover municipal elections organized for Raqqah, Syria, the ministry said. Francois and Elias, working for French radio station Europe1, had been on their way to the northwestern city of Aleppo when they were captured, the station has said.

"Bangkok (CNN) -- The head of the Thai army issued a stern warning Thursday to protesters to avoid violence or the military will take action. Political violence returned to the Thai capital as three anti-government protesters were killed by gunmen, hours before demonstrators hounded the interim Prime Minister from a meeting. ""If the situation turns more violent it could lead to riots,"" Army chief Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha said in a national address. ""The Army will have to use military forces to resolve the situation for peace and order."" The attack occurred at about 2 a.m. local time Thursday when gunmen on a pickup truck opened fire on a protest camp near the site of Bangkok's Democracy Monument, where protesters have been camped for months, said Lt. Gen. Paradon Patthanathabut, Thailand's national security adviser to the Prime Minister. Bangkok's Erawan Emergency Center reported that three people were killed in the attack and 23 injured. The fatally injured victims included a 21-year-old man, who was shot in the chest, and a 51-year-old man. Later that morning, anti-government protesters stormed the grounds of an Air Force office compound, forcing the country's caretaker Prime Minister to flee a meeting with members of the Election Commission. Paradon said the protesters drove a truck through a gate to reach the front of an Air Force office complex, while new interim premier Niwatthamrong Boonsongpaisan and ministers were meeting in another part of the building. As a result of the disruption, the meeting was called off and the politicians left the venue, said Paradon. Air Force spokesman Air Vice Marshal Montol Sanchukorn told CNN that the protesters, who are seeking the government's ouster, then demanded to ""inspect"" the room to check that the Prime Minister was no longer inside. ""We allowed them in to see, and they said they would have a bit of a rest before they left,"" he said. Some protesters remained to stage a sit-in at the complex. Thailand was rocked by rival mass political protests over the weekend, with pro- and anti-government supporters taking to the streets in their tens of thousands following fresh twists in the country's protracted political crisis. Thai turmoil . Caretaker Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra was removed from office along with nine cabinet ministers by a top court last Wednesday, and subsequently indicted by the country's anti-graft body. If the country's Senate votes to impeach her, she could be banned from politics for five years. WATCH: Acting Thai PM -- 'Government still in charge' Protesters led by the People's Democratic Reform Committee have been agitating against her government since November, calling for it to be replaced with an unelected interim government. Drawn mainly from Bangkok's royalist, middle class establishment, the anti-government protesters have been seeking to rid Thai politics of the alleged influence of Yingluck's brother, the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Thaksin, a telecommunications tycoon, was overthrown in a 2006 military coup and has since lived in self-imposed exile to avoid a corruption conviction. His opponents claim he has continued to exert influence in Thai politics through his sister and other allies. The November protests that sparked the current crisis were triggered by the government's botched attempt to pass an amnesty bill that would have cleared the way for his return to the political fold. The anti-government protesters are seeking a new government -- but not through elections, which the opposition Democrat Party has boycotted, arguing the alleged corruption of their political rivals makes widespread reform necessary before any meaningful vote can be held. 'Judicial coup'? Meanwhile the government's ""red shirt"" support base, many of whom hail from the country's rural north and northeast, view Shinawatra's ouster as a ""judicial coup"" and have been protesting what they consider an unfair bias by many of the country's institutions against their side. Yingluck, who was elected in a landslide at the polls in 2011, is the third Thaksin-linked prime minister to be dismissed by the Constitutional Court, which also dissolved Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai political party in 2007. Analyst Paul Quaglia, director at PQA Associates, a Bangkok-based risk assessment firm, told CNN last week that Yingluck's supporters saw her dismissal as a case of politically motivated judicial overreach. ""They consider it a way to usurp democratic elections,"" he said, adding that the opposition was unlikely to win at the polls. ""The Democrat Party say 'No, we can't have elections,' because they know they will lose those elections,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Photographers and artists have a long relationship with art books as vehicles that share their work with audiences beyond the gallery circuit. But do those books have a shelf life beyond their era? To explore their influence on contemporary artists, photography nonprofit Aperture Foundation asked 10 artists to create new works inspired by a photo book or magazine from the publisher's backlist. The final ""responses"" make up the multimedia exhibit ""Aperture Remix: A 60th Anniversary Celebration"" at New York's Aperture Gallery. The exhibit will travel internationally after the show ends Nov. 17. Viewers will be able to see the original books and images that inspired the ""interventions,"" which come in various forms, from new photo books and video slideshows to a functioning camera made of books. ""We want everyone to be able to look at the original work in its purest form as prints, how they were reproduced in Aperture books and what the artists were able to do with it,"" said Lesley Martin, publisher of the Aperture Foundation's book program and the foundation's director of content. ""It was a good time in general to look at the way the photo book has an enduring influence that crosses time and geography,"" she said. ""We wanted to choose artists who represent how far photography has come in the last 60 years."" Most of the artists worked with Aperture before, allowing them to reflect on their relationships as artists with photo books. ""Photo books are the ultimate collaboration between text and images. It's a very complete vehicle for anybody who is or is not interested in photography,"" said visual artist Vik Muniz, who used ""The Daybooks of Edward Weston, Vol. I, Mexico"" (1973) as the inspiration for his Aperture piece. Fine art photography: When 'reality isn't good enough' Muniz, who is known for recreating iconic images with unconventional materials, like syrup and peanut butter, seemed like a natural fit for the project, Martin said. He was the subject of the award-winning documentary ""Waste Land,"" which follows the development of his 2008 series of photographic portraits made from trash. For his piece, Muniz wanted to use an Aperture title that he felt exemplified the connection between text and images. He chose a collection of American photographer Edward Weston's journal entries in the 1920s and 1930s, a time of personal and professional transformation for the iconic American photographer. ""I chose it because it was written by a photographer, and it tells a beautiful story in a very personal way,"" Muniz said. ""He's talking about his feelings and has a very interesting way of looking at how the entire creative process took place in the time it did, not to mention it's a very romantic book."" While the book itself is a 310-page novel that's light on images, Muniz sought to ""create a sort of image that would be emblematic of the whole experience of reading the book."" Using torn up pages from a first edition copy of ""Daybooks"" as source material, he pieces together a photographic collage of Weston's lover, Italian photographer Tina Modotti. Purists might call it desecration of a vintage novel, but he sees it as a recreation of a beloved story. ""Most of my work is about emphasizing the bits and parts, the mechanisms and gears that make an image work,"" he said. ""We all take bits and pieces of books when we read them in a way that we can never look at a book in the same way,"" he said. ""The words in the book will survive because they're proven to have historical value, but the material has transcended mechanism into something else."" Penelope Umbrico approached the entire canon of ""Masters of Photography"" as a singular project in her search for images of mountains. Using her iPhone, she photographed and processed images by Wynn Bullock, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Roger Fenton and Eikoh Hosoe, among others, through a series of camera apps to create 87 ""reimagined"" images as a way of transforming a (mostly) stable landscape feature into a ""disorienting, unstable condition,"" she said. The notion of instability also applies to photography as a medium whose nature is constantly being changed by technology, she said. ""I wondered if there was a correlation between the medium becoming so unstable and idea of a mountain as the most stable object on the planet,"" she said. ""I thought it would be interesting to take a look at that with a device that's changing our day-to-day lives."" She downloaded seven or eight apps onto her iPhone but ended up using the same four most often (Lo-mob, Pictureshow, Plastic Bullet and Hipstamatic) for the ""disorienting"" effects of their filters, creating a candy-colored assortment of images. The resulting project, ""Moving Mountains,"" has three components on display. One is an array of framed images of different sizes arranged on a wall ""in an odd block,"" she said. She also produced a video slideshow and a photo book that she likens to a ""replica"" of the ""Masters of Photography"" book with mountains. Photography has been at the forefront of the ""remix culture"" within art and music in the past century, she said. From pop art photo collages to Photoshop and smartphone apps, the evolution of photography has led the way for bigger cultural shifts. ""The idea of intervention and remix is relevant to what's been happening in the last 10-15 years, where we have a kind of remix culture of things being collected and mashed up,"" she said. ""It's in the air. It makes sense for Aperture to do this for its 60th anniversary.""","Aperture asks 10 artists to create new works inspired by images from its backlist .

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- The families of those on board Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have been waiting for answers for 20 days. The loved ones of those who were passengers on Malaysia Airlines 653 have been waiting for 37 years. Flight 653 was hijacked in 1977 en route from the northern Malaysian city of Penang to Kuala Lumpur, the country's capital. The airliner -- a Boeing 737-200 -- crashed into a mangrove swamp as it descended, killing all 100 on board. Before Flight 370, it was the deadliest incident in Malaysian aviation history. Is it or isn't it? Latest images give analysts hope . ""Thirty-seven years down the line, we still don't really know the truth,"" said Ruth Parr, who was 19 when her father, Thomas, died in the crash. The hijacker or hijackers of MH653 have never been identified, despite cockpit voice recordings that captured everything from the breach of the cockpit, to the sound of gunshots that killed both pilots. According to the Malaysian Civil Aviation Department's report into the crash, the aircraft was hijacked as it approached Kuala Lumpur. Amid confusion over whether it was to land there or not, it proceeded towards neighboring Singapore. As it descended, the crew was shot and the aircraft ""carried out some unusual pitch up and pitch down terminal maneuvers before finally impacting into swampy ground at some 450 knots."" The report concluded that the crash was caused by the crew being fatally incapacitated, leaving the aircraft ""professionally uncontrolled."" However, some eye witnesses at the time reported seeing the aircraft in flames before it hit the ground, while others reported hearing an explosion before impact -- though investigators could not find evidence to support these reports. Defining event . For other family members of MH653 victims reached by CNN, the recent disappearance of MH370 brought back memories of that traumatic time. Over the years, they have learned to cope with their grief, but the 1977 crash will always be a defining event in their lives. 'Unspeakable challenge' for relatives . ""You have to carry that with you all the time,"" said Tom Sherrington, whose father, Richard, was also on MH653. He believes talking openly about their memories of his father, whom he described as a ""fun guy"" and ""big adventurer,"" helped his family to cope. He also said visits to the memorial, built near the crash site in the Malaysian coastal town of Tanjung Kupang, have given his family a tangible place to reflect on their loss. As for the families of those on board MH370, Sherrington said they should focus on remembering their loved ones and try not to fixate on assigning blame. ""The one thing I would say is not for them to get too obsessed with the detail and the recriminations and all that,"" he said. Sherrington added that he hopes the families will stick together and find comfort in each other. China treads carefully amid anger and grief of relatives . 'You can never forget the date' Both Parr and Sherrington warn that everyone processes their grief in different ways and there is no shortcut. It gets a little easier over time but you can never forget the date,"" Parr said. ""You will forever think you see that person out and about, a glance in the car's rearview mirror or crossing the road. It could be anywhere, a voice that sounds like him will have you spinning around only to find it's someone else."" Hopes dashed as orange objects turn out to be fishing equipment .

"(CNN) -- As Thailand continues to battle its worst floods in 50 years, a political analyst involved in the relief effort predicted that streets in the capital would remain flooded for at least two weeks. ""The best-case scenario, two weeks, or one month at its worst case,"" Sean Boonprakong told CNN. In all, 255 pumps were being used to drain the water, he said, crediting their work for sparing much of inner Bangkok from the floodwaters. Though some tourists were trickling in, city life was far from business as usual, he said. ""I think that most people (who live) here -- Thai and foreign alike -- are anxious,"" he said. Indeed, Bangkok residents have plenty to be anxious about. They are dealing with massive piles of garbage stacking up around the flood-stricken city, prompting worries over tainted water, disease and sanitation. In a nation that, according to the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, produces 8,000 tons of garbage a day during normal times, Bangkok residents are dealing with massive piles of trash stacking up around the flood-stricken city. ""There might be over 3 million tons of garbage left over in Bangkok after the floods,"" Deputy Director General Warasart Apaipong of the Pollution Control Department told CNN. ""Five hundred thousand cars might need to be junked, as they would produce toxin wastes from their batteries and engine oil."" Concerns about disease spreading are also growing. The country's Ministry of Public Heath has distributed 20,700 test kits for leptospirosis, a severe bacterial infection that can affect areas where water has been stagnant for more than three weeks. The ministry reported that up until November 7, more than 1.3 million people had become sick in provinces affected by the floods, of which athlete's foot accounted for almost 70% of cases. Water quality in some areas is also being affected, according to Bangkok resident Anisha Prachaseri, while other newer dangers are presenting themselves. ""People have been buying many more bottles of water than normal as there's a problem with tap water, which has been contaminated with floodwaters after it leaked into the pipes,"" she said. Anisha reported that many people are still not able to get out of their homes without a boat, with water levels in many places still two meters above normal. Countless people are also refusing to evacuate their homes, despite government orders to do so. ""There's a great deal of fear that people will electrocuted in the flooded areas if they remain in their homes,"" she said. ""Disease is also a real concern right now."" Meanwhile, Thailand's prime minister has laid out a three-point plan to get the country back on its feet. Immediate aid will be issued to people whose homes and businesses have been destroyed by the floods, which have claimed more than 500 lives since July, Yingluck Shinawatra announced Tuesday. ""This disaster is the biggest that we have ever met. We're trying to cope with situation and help as much as we can,"" she said. ""We can't stop all flooding but we will try to reduce the impact."" Aid packages will be offered to people to help restore homes and businesses as part of a short-term recovery plan over the coming year. Details are expected to be announced next week. Longer-term plans include the formation of two committees, one to oversee reconstruction and future development and the other to manage water resources. Yingluck acknowledged criticism of the official response to the disaster by setting herself a deadline of one year to win back public confidence. The prime minister's promises came as murky waters continued to move towards Bangkok's city center. ""The situation is quite serious. The water is making ground slowly but surely towards the heart of Bangkok,"" flood relief co-ordinator Rungsun Munkong told CNN. Relief workers, distributing aid to evacuation centers in central Bangkok, said they were struggling to reach residents determined to wait out the crisis in tower blocks. ""I think it will be difficult down the road to get help to these people,"" Rungsun said. ""People need clean water, that's the first important thing. Cooked ready-to-eat food is also quite important, baby milk and so on."" A Thailand Disaster and Mitigation Department report, issued Sunday and reported by the state-run MCOT news agency, estimated about 3.1 million people have been affected and 4 million acres of farmland have been damaged. Moreover, the department said two people are believed missing and about 75 highways have closed. In the provinces of Nakhon Sawan and Ayutthaya, cleanup efforts were under way. On Sunday, Yingluck visited Nonthaburi, near Bangkok. There, the government provided 100 boats to help transport people and disperse relief supplies after requests by local officials, according to MCOT. Despite public criticism of the government's overall response, Yingluck said she would not shake up her Cabinet -- in the short-term, at least. She explained that the focus first is to address the situation, with a full evaluation and possible shuffling to be done after the crisis abates, reported MCOT. Floods are an annual occurrence in the country but have been particularly acute this year, and some residents and analysts have criticized the government's response. ""Now the government is sending a mixed signal that the situation is fine, but the truth is it the situation far from over,"" political analyst Supong Limtanakul told CNN. ""It is a slow suffocating death of (the) Bangkok business area."" The city's main airport and two large industrial sites are also at risk, Supong said. Supong said the government did not have enough resources to deal with floodwaters, noting that officials had recently asked the private sector for water pumps to help drain water out of Bangkok. M.R. Sukhumbhand Paribatra, Bangkok's governor, told MCOT that it may take up to two weeks to drain water out of Bangkok's main roads, and months to drain water from smaller roads.

"(CNN) -- Microsoft has slashed the price of its Xbox One console and is offering the device without the accompanying Kinect motion-control system. Beginning on June 9, Microsoft will offer the Xbox One for $399 in all markets where it's sold -- a $100 price cut from the bundled version with Kinect. Customers can place preorders now. In a post Tuesday morning, Microsoft also announced the Xbox One and older Xbox 360 console will no longer require a Live Gold subscription, which cost $60 a year, to access streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu Plus, YouTube and HBO Go. ""Your feedback matters to us and it shapes the products and services we build,"" said Xbox chief Phil Spencer in announcing the move, which suggests Microsoft heeded gamers' complaints that the Xbox One was too expensive. With the move Microsoft is pricing the Xbox One in direct competition with rival Sony's PlayStation 4, which also costs $399. Both consoles launched to great fanfare last November, although the PS4 has outsold the Xbox so far. The PS4 does not charge a subscription fee for access to streaming services. If customers buy an Xbox One for $399 and later decide they want Kinect, Microsoft said a standalone Kinect sensor will become available for sale this fall. And Microsoft will continue to sell a premium Xbox One system, with Kinect, for $499. Kinect lets users control their Xboxes, and in-game avatars, through voice commands and by moving their bodies to simulate movements in a game. More than 80% of Xbox One owners are actively using Kinect, Microsoft said Tuesday.","Beginning on June 9, Microsoft will offer the Xbox One for $399 in all markets .

"(CNN) -- The indigenous people of Alaska have stood firm against some of the most extreme weather conditions on Earth for thousands of years. But now, flooding blamed on climate change is forcing at least one Eskimo village to move to safer ground. Floodwaters rip through the village of Newtok, Alaska, destroying its infrastructure. The community of the tiny coastal village of Newtok voted to relocate its 340 residents to new homes 9 miles away, up the Ninglick River. The village, home to indigenous Yup'ik Eskimos, is the first of possibly scores of threatened Alaskan communities that could be abandoned. Warming temperatures are melting coastal ice shelves and frozen sub-soils, which act as natural barriers to protect the village against summer deluges from ocean storm surges. ""We are seeing the erosion, flooding and sinking of our village right now,"" said Stanley Tom, a Yup'ik Eskimo and tribal administrator for the Newtok Traditional Council. The crisis is unique because its devastating effects creep up on communities, eating away at their infrastructure, unlike with sudden natural disasters such as wildfires, earthquakes or hurricanes. Newtok is just one example of what the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns is part of a growing climate change crisis that will displace 150 million people by 2050.  View a map showing Newtok's proximity to Alaska's Western shore » . The group says indigenous peoples in Asia, Central America and Africa are threatened by shifting environmental conditions blamed on climate change. ""We will not be able to survive"" Tom's ancestors have been living in the region for centuries, he said. ""Our land is our resource, our source of food; it's our country. We live off of it. If we go to another village or city, we will not be able to survive,"" Tom said. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has estimated that moving Newtok could cost $130 million. Twenty-six other Alaskan villages are in immediate danger, with an additional 60 considered under threat in the next decade, according to the corps. The village crisis is taking place as more than 400 indigenous people from 80 nations gather 500 miles (800 kilometers) away in Anchorage, Alaska, at the first Indigenous Peoples' Global Summit on Climate Change. The conference aimed to address global issues effecting indigenous communities like the Yup'ik Eskimos. The five-day summit also hoped to raise global awareness about the crisis facing these indigenous communities and to help them speak with a more unified voice, said Patricia Cochran, chairwoman of the Inuit Circumpolar Council, which hosted the event. U.N. scientists have long blamed increases in average global temperatures on the emission of excess greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide by industry and the burning of petroleum-based fuel. Summit delegates will work on a declaration outlining the climate change-related issues facing indigenous people. The declaration will be agreed upon Friday and presented at the Conference of Parties United Framework Convention on Climate Change in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December. ""On the international level, the meeting in Copenhagen at the end of the year is incredibly important, it will lay down the road map on how we tackle climate change and who gets to be involved,"" said Sam Johnston of Tokyo, Japan-based United Nations University, a co-sponsor of the summit. ""Climate change poses threats and dangers to the survival of indigenous communities worldwide, even though they contribute least to greenhouse emissions,"" United Nations General Assembly President Miguel D'Escoto said at the summit. Worldwide threat . Climate change, conference delegates say, is threatening the traditional lifestyles of indigenous peoples around the world. Specific environmental threats include droughts, sea level rise, warmer temperatures; lack of rainfall, flooding and loss of biodiversity, climatologists say. The specific combination of threats varies by region. For example, in the island nation of Papua New Guinea, an increase in population growth coupled with rising sea levels is decreasing the amount of crop land making farming very difficult for the indigenous people of the region, according to the U.N. In the African nation of Kenya, the Samburu tribe is on the verge of a food and economic crisis, the U.N. said, as lengthy droughts kill livestock that provides income and sustenance for the community. In Mexico, highland Mayan farmers are fighting to survive amid decreasing rainfall, unseasonal frost and unprecedented changes in daytime temperatures, the U.N. reported. These conditions are forcing the farmers to plant alternative crops and to search for other sources of irrigation. ""We are the ones that are the most effected"" by climate change, said Saul Vicente-Vasquez, a Mexican economist and longtime human rights activist for indigenous peoples. ""Climigration"" refers to the forced and permanent migration of communities because of severe climate change effects on essential infrastructure. This differs from migration caused by catastrophic environmental events such as hurricanes and earthquakes. The concept of ""climigration"" implies that there is no possibility of these communities returning home, said Alaskan human rights lawyer Robin Bronen, who coined the term. ""There needs to be a new institutional framework that is created, that's based in human rights doctrines ... that facilitates relocations,"" Bronen said. Back in Newtok, village leaders continue to work with federal and state representatives while they plan to relocate. ""We have a new village, but we don't have all the funding that the village needs to move right now,"" said Sally Russell Cox planner with the Alaska division of community and regional affairs. If the crisis worsens and forces an emergency evacuation, Cox said officials want to provide ""a safe place to go if they need to get out of the village."" As for Tom, he said he's looking forward to getting it over with. ""We hope to move to the new village site and be able to get on with regular life.""","Floods blamed on climate change forcing Alaskan village to move 9 miles away .

"Washington (CNN) -- Political fireworks over a little-noticed Supreme Court appeal and a separate whistleblower lawsuit had U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and a longtime congressional adversary exchanging harsh words at a House committee hearing Wednesday. Holder, testifying before the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee, sparred with GOP Rep. Darrell Issa of California over congressional requests for private e-mails of top Holder aide Thomas Perez, who is President Barack Obama's nominee to be Labor Secretary. Issa suggested Holder had political motives for delaying release of the electronic messages. The two repeatedly talked over each other, and Holder concluded the exchange with a personal attack. ""It is inappropriate and it is too consistent with the way in which you conduct yourself as a member of Congress. It is unacceptable and it is shameful,"" he told Issa, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee who led the effort last year to cite Holder for contempt of Congress in the panel's investigation of the Fast and Furious gun-walking program. Other committee members from both parties then openly debated the propriety of Issa's questioning. At issue is whether Perez -- who heads the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division -- improperly intervened with St. Paul, Minnesota, officials last year in getting them to drop the city's pending Supreme Court appeal over public housing conditions. The Justice Department pulled out of a separate lawsuit it had joined that was brought by a neighborhood pastor and whistleblower. In a report last month, congressional Republicans alleged that Perez engaged in a ""quid pro quo,"" placing ""ideology over objectivity and politics over the rule of law."" Issa opened his questioning by playing an audio clip of a phone call by Perez. Issa suggested Perez in the call was trying to keep any arrangement with St. Paul officials from being disclosed publicly. The congressman then asked whether it was appropriate to ""trade a case."" Holder shook his head and said, ""I don't agree with that characterization."" Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas then jumped in and questioned whether it was proper to play the audio clip without prior notification to committee Democrats. That prompted a spirited back-and-forth among members. Congressional Republicans say the alleged agreement between federal and city officials cost taxpayers $200 million dollars. Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa said Tuesday that Perez's involvement should disqualify him to become Labor Secretary. ""I do not believe Mr. Perez gave us the straight story when he was called upon to answer questions about this case, and for that reason I will strongly oppose his nomination,"" Grassley said in reference to questioning of Perez by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The controversy concerns two separate court cases over alleged public housing discrimination in Minnesota's capital. The Supreme Court case dealt with whether federal law allowed landlords who rent to minorities a right to challenge a city housing code. The St. Paul housing code requires properties to remain in habitable condition. The landlords claim city officials have been overly aggressive in enforcing those requirements, with the hardest impact on minority occupants. Republicans said Perez was concerned a high court defeat for the city would set back or invalidate the legal strategy the Justice Department would use in other broader discrimination investigations. That strategy in short says plaintiffs need not show ""intent"" to discriminate, but merely that policies or enforcement have a ""disparate impact"" on minorities and other protected classes. Just days before the Supreme Court was set to hear oral arguments in Magner v. Gallagher in February 2012, the city announced it was dropping its appeal. Internal Justice Department e-mails obtained by CNN showed Perez helped persuade the city to withdraw, then pushed other federal officials to back out of separate private lawsuits against St. Paul. Led by Rev. Frederick Newell, head of the True Spirit Ministries and a local jobs activist, the suits alleged the city fraudulently made certifications in federal HUD grants totaling about $200 million. ""The department abandoned the whistleblower, Fredrick Newell, after telling him for years that it supported his case,"" said the report by congressional Republicans. ""The manner in which the department treated Newell presents a disconcerting precedent for whistleblower relations."" City officials, the Justice Department, and some congressional Democrats said the HUD grant lawsuits were without merit. A federal judge last year dismissed one of the suits. However, Republican legislators had issued a subpoena for Perez's private e-mails, saying he may have used personal accounts to arrange the deal. ""We have been cooperating and will continue to cooperate with legitimate oversight requests,"" a Justice Department spokesperson said last month. Because of the issue, Perez's confirmation hearings for Labor Secretary have been postponed. Other contentious issues at the hearing dealt with a Justice Department investigation of Associated Press phone records as part of alleged leaks by government officials, and a probe into whether the IRS unfairly targeted conservative advocacy groups seeking tax-exempt status.","Attorney General Holder calls GOP Rep.

"(CNN) -- Former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari has won the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced Friday. Former Finland President Martii Ahtisaari twice worked to find a solution in Kosovo. ""Ahtisaari is an outstanding international mediator,"" said Ole Danbolt Mjoes, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. ""Through his untiring efforts and good results, he has shown what role mediation of various kinds can play in the resolution of international conflicts."" The committee cited Ahtisaari's ""significant"" part in establishing Namibia's independence and his ""central"" role in solving the question of the Indonesian province of Aceh in 2005.  Watch as Finland celebrates the announcement » . Ahtisaari twice worked to find a solution in Kosovo -- first in 1999 and again between 2005 and 2007. He also worked with others this year to find a peaceful solution to the problems in Iraq, the committee said. Ahtisaari and his group, Crisis Management Initiative, also contributed to resolving other conflicts in Northern Ireland, Central Asia, and the Horn of Africa, the committee said. ""The Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes to express the hope that others may be inspired by his efforts and his achievements,"" Mjoes said. The committee awards the peace prize annually according to guidelines laid down in the will of its founder, Alfred Nobel. He specified the prize should go to whoever ""shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses."" The prestigious prize includes a medal, a personal diploma, and 10 million Swedish crowns ($1.4 million) in prize money. Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore shared last year's prize with the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change. The committee plans to award the prize to Ahtisaari on December 10 at Oslo City Hall in Norway. The peace prize is one of five Nobel prizes awarded annually. The others -- for physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature -- were announced this week and will be awarded in Stockholm, Sweden later this year.","Committee cited Ahtisaari's ""significant"" part in Namibia's independence .

"(CNN) -- Now that delegates have converged on Tampa, Florida, for the Republican National Convention, one has to wonder whether there is enough room in the arena for all the conflicting and contradictory elements of the modern Republican Party. There is the camp that claims it wants to be more inclusive, broader in its appeal and more welcoming to women, gays and minorities. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush recently warned that, because of changing demographics, the GOP has to ""reach out to a much broader audience than we do today."" But then there is the camp that ensured that the Republican platform included language rejecting not just same-sex marriage but also the watered-down alternative that many elected officials find more palatable: civil unions. The GOP platform committee also defeated a proposed amendment that said all Americans should be treated ""equally under the law"" as long as they're not hurting anyone else. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who is known for his immigration hard-line, implied that it was fine to treat gays and lesbians differently because: ""Our government routinely judges situations where you might regard people completely affecting themselves like, for example, the use of controlled substances, like, for example, polygamy that is voluntarily entered into. We condemn those activities even though they are not hurting other people at least directly."" Opinion: What the GOP needs to do in Tampa . There is the group that insists it wants to focus on economic issues as the best way to defeat President Barack Obama. Many political observers see Mitt Romney's choice of spending hawk Paul Ryan as his running mate as pretty strong evidence that this view is prevailing at the top of the ticket. But then there is the group that can't seem to resist the catnip of social conservatism and that charges into the abortion debate. The platform also includes an across-the-board ban on all abortions, even in the case of rape or incest. And in 2012, as in previous election years, even with all the supposed emphasis on the economy, being pro-choice was considered a liability for those vying for the Republican presidential nomination and a disqualifier for anyone chosen to be vice president. There is the camp that calls for states such as Arizona to have the last say in shaping immigration policy by enlisting local police in the enforcement of federal immigration laws, denying driver's licenses to illegal immigrants or attempting to punish landlords who rent to them. But there is also the camp that insists that states shouldn't have the final word with regard to immigration if it means they can grant drivers' permits to illegal immigrants or opt out of a program such as Secure Communities, which requires local police to submit to federal authorities the fingerprints of anyone they arrest to determine if they're in the country illegally. There is the faction that still thinks you can keep out illegal immigrants from Mexico and the rest of Latin America by building walls and fences on the U.S.-Mexico border, but also the faction that wants to create new ways to bring in an ample supply of Mexican immigrants to work legally in agriculture, hospitality, construction and other industries. There is the group that supports Romney's plan to encourage illegal immigrants to simply ""self-deport"" by making the country more unwelcoming and drying up employment opportunities, and the group that worries about a labor shortage and economic slowdown if that happens. Opinion: Romney's 'birther' remark is no joke . The party platform expresses support for something that some employers want: a temporary guest worker program that imports foreign labor to offset worker shortages in fields such as agriculture. And it also backs something that many employers don't: a requirement that all businesses participate in the government-administered e-verify system, which is supposed to determine whether an employee is legally eligible to work. This is some strange hash. What does it mean to be a Republican these days if unifying principles are so hard to come by? A generous explanation could be that this is an example of the GOP ""big tent"" that some conservatives have always dreamed of, where Republicans with different views can put aside their disagreements and come together in a common purpose. A more realistic explanation is that, in 2012, the Republican Party has become a patchwork of individual interests united only by a shared desire to ensure that Obama is limited to a single term. We'll have to see if that is enough to hold the coalition together. And if so, what it means for the future of the Grand Ol' Party. What happens in Tampa will be our first clue. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Ruben Navarrette: The deep divisions in the Republican Party are evident .

"Barcelona, Spain (CNN) -- Mozilla announced Sunday it will launch handsets running its new Firefox mobile operating system, pitting itself directly against Apple and Google. The nonprofit company made the announcement at a news conference on the eve of the world's largest mobile technology show, Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, under the new marketing slogan ""Unleash the fox."" The company says it is partnering with 18 network operators and four handset manufacturers around the world to launch handsets running its open-source mobile operating system, which it also demonstrated Sunday. Alcatel, LG and ZTE will be first to build the first Firefox OS devices, with Huawei to follow later in the year, a spokesman said. The company said the first wave of Firefox devices would go on sale beginning in July in Brazil, Colombia, Hungary, Mexico, Montenegro, Poland, Serbia, Spain and Venezuela. What features would you like to see? The new software is built on open Web standards and is capable of operating on much less sophisticated devices than many existing smartphones, the company says. ""Firefox OS will break down the walls between apps and the Web because Firefox OS apps are built using Web technologies, like HTML5,"" said Jay Sullivan, Mozilla's senior vice president of products. ""We expect to see lots of amazing apps people love built for Firefox OS because more developers are already creating for the Web than for any other platform."" Developers will be free to build and sell mobile applications for the operating system without having to share revenue with Apple or Google. NYPD dedicates squad to phone thefts . John Jackson, vice president of the research company IDC, said, ""The impressive lineup of operators who have now pledged to distribute Firefox OS devices speaks clearly and powerfully to the platform's potential and points to 2013 being a breakout year for Mozilla in the mobile domain. However, Stuart Miles, editor of gadget review site Pocket-lint, said while there was potential for success in developing countries, the company faced an uphill struggle against the established big players. ""It's an interesting move, mainly because I think the people that are backing it are doing so to either hedge their bets or to provide leverage against the bigger players. ""The idea of HTML web apps is one that Apple had five years ago with the launch of the iPhone but soon realized that they could make much more money by charging for apps rather than giving them away for free. As an organization, Mozilla doesn't have those concerns."" Sleep texting is a thing . Mozilla says operators who have committed to devices include AmÃ©rica MÃ³vil, China Unicom, Deutsche Telekom, Etisalat, Hutchison Three Group, KDDI, KT, MegaFon, Qtel, SingTel, Smart, Sprint, Telecom Italia Group, TelefÃ³nica, Telenor, TMN and VimpelCom.","Mozilla to introduce mobile phones with its Firefox open-source operating system .

"(CNN) -- Tonalist won the Belmont Stakes ""fair and square,"" California Chrome co-owner Steve Coburn told ABC on Monday as he apologized to horse racing fans and ""the world"" for his bitter remarks after the third leg of the Triple Crown. Appearing on ""Good Morning America"" for the second consecutive day, the owner of the winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes said he was ashamed of himself for his rants after his horse came up short in its bid to win the first Triple Crown since 1978. Coburn blamed his post-race tirade on his desire to make many people happy. ""This is America's horse. I wanted it so much for this horse to win the Triple Crown for the people of America,"" he told ABC during an emotional interview in which he held back tears. ""And I was very emotional."" Tonalist won Saturday by a head, edging Commissioner. Medal Count was third while California Chrome and Wicked Strong tied for fourth. None of the other horses raced in both the first two Triple Crown events. That upset Coburn, who said other horse owners took ""the coward's way out."" His wife, Carolyn, tried to stop the tirade, but Coburn went on. ""I was trying to calm him down,"" she recalled Monday. Coburn didn't ease off his comments Sunday. On ABC, he was asked whether he regretted his rant. ""Not only no, but hell no,"" Coburn answered. ""I do not regret it one bit. It's the truth."" But Monday, he was full of apologies. He apologized to Tonalist's owner and trainer, California Chrome's co-owner Perry Martin, California Chrome's fans, and to ""all of horse racing and the world."" He said he was wrong to complain about the system. Many fans and nonfans agreed with him, however, saying it's fair to make horses run all three races. They take place in the span of five weeks and end with the longest race of the three. Coburn said California Chrome, who was stepped on just after leaving the starting gate and suffered a foot injury, will race again. Carolyn Coburn told ABC she hoped the post-race rant wasn't the lingering memory people have of her husband. ""That wasn't the way he normally is. He's a very compassionate man,"" she said.","Of top finishers at Belmont, only California Chrome had run first two legs of Triple Crown .

"(CNN) -- A formerly classified government memo authorizing the drone attack that killed American terror suspect Anwar al-Awlaki was released on Monday by a federal court. The government for years fought disclosure of the 2010 document produced by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, saying it would harm national security. The legal memo shows how the Obama administration laid out its case in an internal debate over the attack that killed the suspected al Qaeda operative in a 2011 CIA drone strike. The Justice Department considered Yemeni-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) an ""enemy force."" The document said the government had no feasible way to arrest al-Awlaki and concluded the authorization of military force against al Qaeda applied to him as it would a non citizen. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the release of a redacted version of the memo in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and New York Times.","Terror suspect Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in a 2011 drone strike .

"Washington (CNN) -- A free speech dispute over a California law banning sale of violent video games to children will go to the Supreme Court for review. The justices Monday accepted the state's appeal and will decide whether the law is too restrictive in denying access by minors to often-graphic material. Video-game makers say the ban goes too far. They say the existing nationwide, industry-imposed, voluntary ratings system is an adequate screen for parents to judge the appropriateness of computer games. The state says it has a legal obligation to protect children when the industry has failed to do so. At issue is how far constitutional protections of free speech and expression, as well as due process, can be applied to youngsters. Critics of the law say the government would in effect be engaged in the censorship business, using ""community standards"" to evaluate artistic and commercial content. Oral arguments will be held in the fall. A federal appeals court in San Francisco, California, tossed out the law before it took effect, after Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed it in 2005. He applauded the high court's decision to intervene. ""We have a responsibility to our kids and our communities to protect against the effects of games that depict ultraviolent actions, just as we already do with movies,"" the governor said. The legislation was designed to strengthen the current rating system, and would have placed an outright ban on the sale or rental to those under 18 of games deemed excessively violent. As defined by California, such interactive games are those in which the player is given the choice of ""killing, maiming, dismembering or sexually assaulting an image of a human being"" in offensive ways. Retailers could be fined up to $1,000 for any violation. The gaming industry sued in federal court and won an injunction halting enforcement of the law until the courts sort out the constitutional questions. In a written statement, Michael Gallagher, president of the Entertainment Software Association, said he is hopeful his industry will prevail and ""the court will reject California's invitation to break from these settled principles by treating depictions of violence, especially those in creative works, as unprotected by the First Amendment."" The motion picture industry has its own self-monitoring ratings system, imposed decades ago after complaints that some films were too explicit for general audiences in what was seen and heard. The gaming industry says its ratings system roughly follows the same self-imposed guidelines, and ratings are clearly labeled on the packaging. The state argued it was responding to parents' complaints that too much violent material -- including gruesome battles to the death between on-screen competitors and adversaries -- was being viewed and played by minors. Officials claimed the current ratings system is not adequate in filtering out the controversial content, and that underage teens have been able to buy ""M-rated"" games designed only for mature, or adult, players. Lawmakers also said there is a ""causal connection"" between access to such games and psychological or other harm to children. In their petition to the high court, state lawyers cited studies showing children who repeatedly watch on-screen games can become more aggressive, antisocial, and less able to distinguish the consequences of violence in real life. Similar efforts in other states to restrict gaming content have been rejected by various courts. The Supreme Court in recent years has thwarted repeated congressional attempts to protect children from pornography, saying legislation went too far in limiting adult access to explicit, but lawful, sexual content on the internet. And the justices last week threw out a federal law limiting the sale of graphic videos of animal cruelty. The court has also said in a variety of contexts that minors enjoy a variety of free-expression rights. The case is Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants (08-1448).","Supreme Court to rule on California law banning sales of some video games to minors .

"CLEVELAND, Ohio (CNN/WKYC) -- An emergency room physician accused of murdering his wife with cyanide pleaded not guilty on Wednesday, nearly four years after her death. Rosemarie DiPuccio Essa's family say they want ""justice for Rosie."" A judge set bail for Yazeed Essa at $75 million at a hearing attended by members of his slain wife's family. Police say Rosemarie DiPuccio Essa, 36, weakened by cyanide poisoning, died in a car wreck on February 24, 2005. Yazeed Essa left the United States in March 2005, shortly after being questioned by police about his wife's death. He was indicted by a Cuyahoga County grand jury in February 2007. ""This man lied to us,"" said Dominic DiPuccio, brother of Rosemarie Essa, outside the arraignment courtroom at the Justice Center in Cleveland. ""Right after my sister Rosie was murdered,"" DiPuccio said, ""Yazeed Essa swore to us on the heads of his two little children that he had nothing to do with her death. Now we know the truth and can't wait for him to face justice."" Choking back tears as they waited for the case to be called, the DiPuccio family said they've been waiting almost four years for Essa to return to Cleveland and face the charge of aggravated murder. Police investigators said Yazeed Essa initially said his wife was taking calcium supplements. But when Essa turned over his wife's pill vial to detectives, tests revealed that several pills contained deadly potassium cyanide rather than calcium. Potassium cyanide, used in electroplating gold and euthanizing insects for collections, looks like sugar and can smell like almonds. It can be dissolved in water and hidden in food or medications. Moments before she died, Rosemarie Essa called a friend on her cell phone and said her husband had insisted she take a calcium pill before leaving home, officials said. A few weeks later, Yazeed Essa went to Beirut, Lebanon, and spent 19 months in the Middle East. He was taken into custody in Nicosia, Cyprus, when officials discovered his identity. He was extradited late last week. Essa ""fled the United States because he did not believe he could get a fair trial, since he is an Arab-American,"" defense attorney Steven Bradley said. ""Since the election of Barack Obama as president, Essa now believes the political climate has changed enough that he was willing to return and now get a fair trial,"" Bradley said. Bradley and his co-counsel, Mark Marein, said they were not shocked that Judge Joan Synenberg set bail at $75 million. ""Our client is fully prepared to remain in jail until the time of his trial. He says he is an innocent man."" Essa's late wife's family takes a different view. ""We have absolutely no doubt that he is a killer,"" DiPuccio said. ""It's been really tough for all of us and we're glad this day has finally come. Maybe we can get some justice for Rosie."" Rosemarie Essa's mother, Gigi DiPuccio, held the hands of her husband, Rocco, and said, ""I think about my daughter every day."" As her eyes filled with tears, she said, ""Now we just want to get justice for Rosie and the kids and our family so we can start to heal. We're at the first step right now. We need to get through this and we will as a family."" If convicted of aggravated murder, Yazeed Essa faces a life sentence, with parole eligibility after 20 years in prison.","Dr. Yazeed Essa pleads not guilty to wife's cyanide murder .

"(CNN) -- This weekend, Manchester United's Alex Ferguson will attempt to become the first manager in history to win three Champions League titles when his side face Barcelona at Wembley. The achievement, which would match the late Bob Paisley's European Cup feat with Liverpool in the 1970s, is not only a testimony to Ferguson's run of success since taking over at Old Trafford in 1986, but also continues the remarkable legacy that Scottish managers continue to have on football as a whole. From Ferguson to Matt Busby, Kenny Dalglish to Bill Shankly, George Graham to Jock Stein, the impact that Scottish managers have had through the years is so great that it has changed the course of history for some major football institutions. Earlier this month, Ferguson, the son of a Glasgow shipbuilder, guided United to a record 19th English league  title, with all but two of those successes coming under the guidance of either Ferguson or Busby -- whose five league titles would surely have been many more but for the 1958 Munich air crash which decimated his ""Busby Babes"" squad. Liverpool's period of dominance in English and European football began when Shankly -- who was born and raised in a tiny Ayrshire mining village -- took over in 1959, helping the club to three league titles, a feat matched by compatriot and current Anfield incumbent Dalglish. Arsenal had spent 18 years in the football wilderness before Graham, the youngest of seven children brought up by his mother after his father died when he was still a baby, took over and led the club to two titles in three seasons in 1989 and 1991. And the legendary Stein, another to be brought up in a coal mining community, led Celtic to become the first ever British winners of the European Cup in 1967, with Busby guiding United to victory the very next year. The trend for successful Scottish managers has now spanned seven decades and Jim Fleeting, the Director of Football Development at the Scottish Football Association (SFA), told CNN that he believed the continued success of his compatriots was no coincidence. ""Scottish people, by nature are hard workers -- they are grafters, are open minded, and traditionally looking to better themselves,"" said Fleeting. ""It is a Scottish trait, but particularly from the Glasgow area. Many of these successful managers come from that part of Scotland. It is a very working class and hard working region of the country,"" he continued. ""I don't know why so many successful managers come from Scotland, but the traditional values and ideals that are instilled into people definitely help. ""It is significant that not as many managers come from the more middle class Edinburgh area, where, traditionally, the financial industry would get most of its workforce from."" The figures back up Fleeting's claim. Out of the last 26 seasons, 18 English titles have been won by Scottish managers, compared to just two by Englishmen, a remarkable statistic. And when the English Premier League season finished on Sunday, seven managers from the Glasgow area were sitting in the dug-out, with Paul Lambert arriving next season following Norwich's promotion to the top tier. Former Scottish international Mark McGhee, who was a member of Ferguson's successful Aberdeen side, prior to his move to United, before later becoming a Premier League manager in his own right at Leicester, endorsed Fleeting's view. ""I think the people of Glasgow are different and unique compared to the rest of Scotland,"" McGhee, himself a native Glaswegian, told CNN. ""Despite the success of these managers they are not pretentious or big time and maintain a sense of reality and humility, which I believe is a huge factor to getting the best out of players. ""What Ferguson does in particular is manage to get players to believe that he feels things personally. So, if you play badly, you are letting him down as a person, as well as the team, and his players really bought into that ethic,"" added McGhee. Another major factor in the development of Scottish coaches and managers has been the rise in prominence of the Scottish national training center in Largs, on the Ayrshire coast. The SFA run a number of UEFA coaching courses at the academy and many  top Scottish managers, past and present, have passed through its doors at one time or another, as well as many other leading coaches worldwide including Real Madrid's Jose Mourinho and Andre Villas Boas of Porto. ""I don't think the academy has been the primary reason for the success of Scottish coaches and I don't think we can take credit for their achievements,"" said Fleeting. ""But we have had Stein and Ferguson, as well as many other top coaches, giving seminars here, and that knowledge and expertise must rub off. ""Young coaches come here and they know they must sacrifice having their summer off, learning from experienced tutors and mentors,"" he added. ""At the end of the day, a coaching diploma is no guarantee of success but it is a confirmation of professional competence, and hopefully the techniques learned at Largs have helped them along the way."" McGhee was another coach who spent time at the Largs training center, and he too believes the skills he learned there went some way to his success as a coach. ""The mentors on the courses encouraged us to learn different skills, to think outside the box,"" said McGhee. ""We were forever being challenged to think of new ideas with the principle being that the skills we were being taught was only the beginning of our coaching journey. ""In my case, I found it a ground-breaking and modern way of learning. We had coaches from all over the world on our course and the SFA seem to be some years ahead of their English counterparts in the development of coaches."" And the biggest example of McGhee's view is Ferguson himself. Come Saturday night, one of the greatest coaches football has ever seen could be out on his own as the number one of all time.","Alex Ferguson on the brink of winning his third Champions League winners' medal .

"(CNN) -- More and more airlines are teaming up with world-class chefs, hoping to solve that ultimate #firstworldproblem: how to serve a top-rate meal in the air. The strategy seems to be to throw glamorous, big-name chefs at the problem and hope that they can recreate on planes that same gastronomic magic they do at their restaurants. Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal helped British Airways with a special Olympic in-flight menu in 2012; Joel Robuchon and Air France have made headlines with their collaboration, which began in 2011. The Ritz-Carlton Hong Kong has also been tasked with creating a first-class menu for Cathay Pacific. Their Italian restaurant, Tosca, is famous for creative Italian cooking and recently received one Michelin star after Pino Lavarra took over as executive chef. Lavarra was asked to whip up a gourmet menu that will work at 30,000 feet above sea level. He went one step further: Lavarra is serving the same in-flight meal at Tosca as a special four-course ""first class menu"" costing HK$1,400 ($180) per head. Airplane food served at an expensive restaurant? Lavarra admits it's not the easiest sell. ""I agree that in-flight food has a bad reputation. I also find most of it terrible,"" says the chef. Lofty ambitions . He says The Ritz-Carlton's height inspired the menu. The hotel is nearly 500 meters (1,640 feet) above ground, earning it the superlative of ""world's highest hotel,"" and bringing its guests close to a mid-air experience, without them getting on a plane. The two menus -- in-flight and on the ground -- can't be exactly the same however. Lavarra says the idea of recreating gourmet restaurant experiences in the air will only ever be a concept. In reality, it will never be replicated. ""The meal served on the plane, it's cooked by somebody else, it's prepared eight to 12 hours ahead of time, it's mass production,"" says Lavarra. In other words, it isn't the personalized, fussy cooking of a top-notch restaurant. But the biggest problem is an airline's concern for food safety, which trumps the customer's desire for deliciousness. ""Everything has to be pasteurized, and you can't use raw tuna or raw beef,"" says Lavarra. The chef serves high-quality beef carpaccio on both his in flight and restaurant menus. The one at the restaurant is a traditional Italian appetizer of thick slices of tender raw beef paired with ricotta and a perky tomato jam. The same dish on the plane has to be tweaked to get around food safety regulations: the beef is seared first, so it isn't really a carpaccio anymore. For connoisseurs, it would be the equivalent of adding water to aged whiskey. Don't count on the bread . ""My food costs are 45%. I have given my food supplier list to Cathay and I believe they use the exact same ingredients as I do at Tosca,"" says Lavarra, who has had to adjust many of the other ingredients so the dishes can withstand storage and re-heating. One item that made the chef throw in the towel was the bread. ""It is quite tricky to make it crunchy and nice, you have to reheat it, on a flight that is basically impossible to do. The airline caterers have done a decent job considering it is baked 15 hours in advance, but it's not 'wow,'"" he says. The chef is also taking a deeper look at the overall experience for gourmets. At the restaurant, the experience is a gradual build-up to a crescendo of a main dish. The chef would temper the first few courses so the diner is not overwhelmed. ""From start to end, you have to keep the interest of the customer,"" says Lavarra. On a flight, it's a shorter meal, with Lavarra's special main course competing with other regular offerings. The chef makes sure to dial up the flavors of his main dish, including the tastiest, most intense ingredients. ""I only have one chance to impress the customer. I have to be spot on,"" he says. Cathay Pacific's partnership with Pino Lavarra and Tosca runs until July 31, 2014, on various long-haul and regional flights departing Hong Kong.","Can fine-dining experiences really be pulled off at 30,000 feet?

"(CNN) -- In Neshoba County, Mississippi, on the night of June 21-22, 1964, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner went missing. Their bodies would be discovered in an earthen dam 44 days later as the ultimate payment for their efforts to secure voting rights for all Americans. Yet 50 years later, it's as if it barely happened. A right-leaning Supreme Court has decimated the Voting Rights Act, the very law inspired by the deaths of those three young men. Their rulings have given the OK to conservative legislatures and governors nostalgic for the Old South to reinstitute roadblocks to voting. What happened to learning from history? You might remember this case was the basis of the 1988 movie ""Mississippi Burning,"" which starred Gene Hackman as a crusading FBI agent bent on getting to the bottom of killings by the Ku Klux Klan, though it's hardly historically accurate. ""The movie I love to hate,"" Steve Schwerner, Michael's brother, told me from New York last week. ""It makes out the FBI as the hero (yet) the Civil Rights Movement felt that the FBI was the enemy and was working with local law enforcement (who were Klan members) much more than the movement."" Chaney's sister, Julia Moss-Chaney, also decried the portrayal of a ""hero FBI."" ""Tell me about it,"" she said from her home in Willingboro, New Jersey. ""If all of that had been invested, it wouldn't have taken 44 days"" to find the bodies. Or even longer if two of the missing men had not been white. Schwerner and Goodman were white and Jewish from New York. Chaney was a black Mississippian. In a bitter irony of what the three men stood for, it was the notion of white lives being more valuable than black that helped bring their deaths to national attention. ""It's no secret that had my brother not been with Mickey Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, we would not have known anything of what had happened to him. It's a painful reality, but it is common knowledge,"" Moss-Chaney said. Schwerner agreed. ""We wouldn't be talking right now if it was only Jim Chaney or if it was three Mississippi black people. There were many people that had been killed in Mississippi beforehand, and with the exception of Medgar Evers never made The New York Times, never made NBC News. Nobody ever mentioned their names."" Michael Schwerner had arrived in Mississippi earlier that spring. Teaming up with Chaney, he immediately raised the ire of the Ku Klux Klan. ""He was targeted from the moment he arrived,"" Moss-Chaney said. ""You know the nature of hate: 'Let me first make sure I degrade you to the degree in my mind that you are less than human.' There's nothing less than human for a white man to be than a 'n----- lover.' Once that's established, then anything goes."" Goodman joined them on June 20, 1964. They were riding in a blue Ford station wagon the next day when a deputy sheriff stopped them. ""It is sad, heartbreakingly sad, that Andy's first day in Mississippi was the last day of his life,"" Moss-Chaney said, her voice going quiet. What were they doing that so outraged the good old boys? Aside from just being black and white together, their major work was voter registration, at the time barred to black people unless they could answer impossible questions such as how many bubbles are in a bar of soap. An FBI investigation did lead to the federal conviction of seven conspirators in the case. Mississippi didn't get around to prosecuting the case until more than 40 years later, when Klan leader Edgar Ray Killen was convicted and sentenced to three maximum 20-year terms for the murders. The killings fueled passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 and the Voting Rights Act the next year. Yet much of that progress was turned back in 2013 when the U.S. Supreme Court gutted crucial provisions of the Voting Rights Act. It followed that in April with a ruling against affirmative action efforts in higher education. Part of the justices' argument was that federal actions to assure equality at the ballot box have been successful, so they're not needed anymore. But that's like saying a car rolls well with wheels, so you can take them off. And proof that it doesn't work is that as soon as those enforcement measures were lifted, voter restrictions returned in the form of less-than-logical Voter ID laws. One of those allows prospective voters to present gun registration cards as acceptable proof of eligibility, but not student IDs, Attorney General Eric Holder said in December. Is that any less ridiculous or subjectively discriminatory than asking voters to count bubbles in a bar of soap? Yes, the arc of the moral universe is long and may bend toward justice, but it also makes a couple of back flips along the way. ""We've certainly made some progress,"" Schwerner said of where the country is now, a half century after the murders. ""On a scale of 1 to 10, if you started at 1 when Brown vs. Board of Education came down in 1954, we might be at 4 now."" For that, three men gave their lives.","Robin Washington says 50 years after the murders in Mississippi, history repeats itself .

"Bekaa Valley, Lebanon (CNN) -- After I became a father, I found covering the stories of refugees more heart-wrenching than ever before. Of course, it is the children that immediately draw your attention. It is their wide-eyed fascination with everything you do. They want to touch my producer Danielle's hair and play with the gadgets of my cameraman, Clayton. They exchange high fives, give the peace sign, and gamely practice their English on me. I try not to let my mind wander to the place that imagines what the lives of these sweet children will be like weeks or months from now. They are images nobody should ever see. People starve to death here. How to help Syrian refugees . For the past several days, I had been in refugee camps along the border between Syria and Lebanon. Over the past 12 years, I have covered wars, natural disasters and other tragedies as a medical reporter, which meant the very worst stories filtered down to me. I remember a child who lost both her legs after stepping on a land mine in Iraq. I remember a family standing in a decimated home in Sri Lanka, having lost all it owned. In Port-au-Prince, Haiti, I saw young children searching for their parents in large garbage dumpsters, hoping to catch a final glimpse of them. Pakistan was full of stories of families swept away by the floods that soaked one-fifth of the nation. Some of the very worst stories are happening again. None of this is easy to write. I am here because I believe the few minutes you spend reading this firsthand dispatch will give you a clearer idea of what is unfolding here. While you may not be able to locate the Bekaa Valley on a map, or even Damascus for that matter, stories about health are universal and serve as a common denominator all over the planet. Over the past two years, 720,000 registered refugees have made the dangerous crossing from Syria into Lebanon. According to aid organizations on the ground, at least that many more have also come across illegally. In a country of 4 million people, roughly one in four is now a refugee. Lebanon is buckling under the weight of these refugees, leading to abysmal conditions. In the largest camp in Bekaa Valley, there is no fixed water supply or sanitation. There are streams of putrid waste snaking their way through the camps. And there is not enough food. As a dad, you get pretty good at judging the age of children, based on their size. Here, nothing makes sense. There are 8-month-olds who look closer in age to newborns, and 10-year-olds who look 5. And often, it is the young child forced to care for an even younger child. In a place like this, you can quickly distinguish the children who are being breast-fed from those who are not. While the breast-fed children are getting carbohydrates, fats and proteins, they are not getting enough calories overall. It is tough, after all, when the mother has not had anything to eat for days herself. The child's hair looks dull, the skin looks thin and the body looks emaciated. It is called marasmus, and it shouldn't typically happen to a breast-fed baby. Syria's traumatized refugee children . Again, nothing here is typical. The older children who are able to obtain any sort of calories are not getting enough proteins in their diet. They eat primarily just grains. Their small bodies look bloated and they often have swelling in their tiny feet. It also has a name: kwashiorkor. I learned much of this in medical school, and even then I prayed to never see it firsthand. Sadly, I now know the look of eyes that have not seen food for too long. They can look at nothing else. It is not a hopeful look, but a sad resignation that despite their deep hunger, these morsels of basic food are not meant for them. If you are a parent or have any compassion whatsoever, seeing those eyes will bring you to your knees. U.N. Number of Syrian refugees tops 2 million . To simply live in a makeshift tent on a 10-by-10-foot plot of dirt, some of the landowners in Bekaa Valley are charging $100 a month. It would almost be laughable except as so often happens -- the children bear the brunt of this hardship. They work in the fields for $2 a day, beg under bridges and turn to prostitution. Truth is, I feel guilty the moment I arrive, knowing I will leave and wave wildly at the tiny little friends running alongside our car -- as if that will somehow make things any better for them. These children will fill your daytime thoughts and your dreams at night. Their minds are brimming with dreams unrealized and their hearts are so full of hope. I often think of my own children and how disappointed they would be that their daddy couldn't do more to help kids like them. It would be missing the point to say that I see the eyes of my own children, when I look into the children's eyes of Bekaa Valley. Truth is, these are my children. They are the children of the world, Many of them will persevere, and may even make it home to a hopefully more stable way of life. But, for the time being -- this is the price they pay as refugees in Lebanon, September 2013.","Dr. Sanjay Gupta has been at refugee camp outside of Syria .

"(CNN) -- In a dimly lit Florida theater, Curtis Reeves got into an argument with another moviegoer over texting. The two men exchanged words that gradually became more heated and Reeves felt something hit his face. Reeves, who minutes earlier had gone to seek a manager's help to stop the texting, this time reached into a pocket in his pants for, police say, a pistol. He later told police he feared the man was going to attack him. Reeves, a former police officer, pulled a gun and shot once, hitting Chad Oulson in the chest and Oulson's wife, Nicole, in the hand she was using to grab her husband in an attempt to calm things down. As the victim struggled to breathe and fell onto two other patrons, Reeves sat down. An off-duty deputy five seats over charged toward him and grabbed the gun, which had jammed. Chad Oulson died later at a hospital. His wife's wound was considered non-life threatening. The shooter's son -- an off-duty Tampa police officer -- was just arriving at theater 10. He had been delayed to his date with his father and his mother, and he had no idea his dad had just killed another man. On Tuesday, Curtis Reeves, 71, made his first appearance in court for a charge of second-degree murder. Reeves' attorney, Richard Escobar, tried to persuade Circuit Judge Lynn Tepper that the former police officer was actually the victim in the incident and that Oulson was the ""aggressor."" Police said despite Reeves' claim that he was in fear of his safety, this was not a case for Florida's ""stand your ground"" defense. ""Working with the state attorney's office it was determined that stand-your-ground does not fly here in this case,"" Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco said. Authorities said a preliminary investigation had determined that there was no physical contact during the incident Monday afternoon at a theater in the Tampa suburb of Wesley Chapel. It was popcorn, thrown by Oulson, 43, that struck Reeves. Sgt. Steve Greiner, the first Pasco County deputy to encounter Reeves, said the suspect was very calm as he sat in his chair. He had an almost distant stare toward the screen, Greiner said. Reeves also stared silently into a closed-circuit camera Tuesday, listening to Escobar tell Tepper why his client should be granted bail. Tepper said there was no evidence to support the claim that the shooter was a victim, according to a probable cause affidavit. She denied bond and ruled that Reeves should face the second-degree murder charge. The judge addressed Reeves and asked him if he understood what had happened and that he was facing life in prison; Reeves said he did. Reeves' attorney then said that he and his client would speak in private, indicating that the former officer should not say anything in court. Reeves wore a bullet-resistant vest. Nocco said it was for the defendant's safety. An argument over texting, then a shot . The shooting happened Monday afternoon at the Grove 16 theater about 1:25 p.m. ET, just before an afternoon showing of ""Lone Survivor,"" a film about a Navy SEAL mission. Reeves was with his wife and sat behind Oulson and his wife, authorities said. Chad Oulson was using his cell phone and Reeves told him to put it away, according to police and witnesses. The two men began to argue and Reeves walked out of the auditorium. Police said Reeves was going to complain to a theater employee. But Nocco told CNN on Tuesday night that the manager was busy with another customer and Reeves never addressed his complaint with a supervisor. When Reeves returned, witnesses and authorities said that Oulson asked him if he had gone to tell on him for texting. Oulson reportedly said, in effect: I was just sending a message to my young daughter. Police said Tuesday that Oulson was texting the daughter's babysitter. Charles Cummings and his adult son were two seats away. Cummings said that when Reeves returned to the theater, there was no manager with him. ""He came back very irritated,"" Cummings recalled. Voices were raised. Oulson threw a bag of popcorn at Reeves, police said. Then, the former police officer took out a .380 semi-automatic handgun and shot Oulson. As Oulson staggered and fell, ""He said, 'I can't believe I got shot,'"" the younger Cummings recounted. ""Blood started coming out of his mouth. I was trying to hold him up. He just fell down."" ""I can't believe people would bring a pistol to a movie,"" said the elder Cummings, a Vietnam War veteran who was celebrating his birthday by spending the afternoon with his son. Chaos in a theater . During Reeves' first appearance Tuesday, his attorney argued that Oulson was the ""aggressor."" ""It may or may not have been popcorn,"" Judge Tepper said, but an unknown object ""does not equal"" taking out a gun. Witnesses told police they saw no punches being thrown during the incident, according to the report. There were about 25 people in the movie theater. After the shooting, some tried to help Oulson and to make sure no other people were hurt. An off-duty deputy sheriff from Sumter County rushed over to make sure no more shots were fired and that the shooter was not going to get up. One of two nurses in the audience ran to Oulson's side and performed CPR until paramedics arrived. An autopsy will be conducted Tuesday. A sensational crime that strikes many chords . A former cop and security worker . Reeves retired in 1993 as a captain with the police department in nearby Tampa. He also was director of security at Busch Gardens until 2005, a spokesman told CNN. Police told CNN that Reeves was instrumental in establishing the police department's first tactical response team. Records released by the department indicate that he was often praised for his work ethic and leadership. Negative remarks were rare, such as a 1979 evaluation that said he had shown a temper when dealing with supervisors. After court Tuesday, reporters circled Escobar as he headed to his car. Escobar said that Reeves has ""great credentials"" and called him a ""great man."" ""Certain circumstances happened in that theater,"" the attorney said, and those details would come out at trial, he said. ""Mr. Reeves is certainly heartbroken,"" that someone lost their life, the lawyer said. A neighbor told Bay News 9 that Reeves is a nice guy. ""Always smiling. I've never seen him angry,"" Bill Costas said. ""If I needed help with something, he was always there."" Who is Curtis Reeves? Who was the texting dad? Chad Oulson was a former U.S. Navy petty officer, serving from 1990 to 1997, according to spokeswoman Lt. Richlyn Neal. Tuesday morning, a woman who said she was Oulson's sister answered the door at his home in the Tampa suburb of Land O' Lakes, the Tampa Tribune reported. She told a reporter that the family is in shock and declined to comment. In the home's garage, the Tribune reporter said, a motocross motorcycle was on a stand next to a gold pickup truck and a child's wagon. ""He loved his job, loved his family, loved motocross, loved the motorcycle world,"" friend Joseph Detrapani told the newspaper. ""He grew up riding motocross and loved to keep doing it, even at his age of 43, he's still out there every weekend riding."" Rules for the theater . Meanwhile, Cobb Theatres, which operates the Grove complex, released a statement: ""This was an isolated altercation between two guests that escalated unexpectedly. The safety, security and comfort of our guests and team members are always our top priorities, and we are truly heartbroken by this incident."" A list of prohibited items and behavior in their theaters is on the theater website. On the list: no cell phone use, including texting, in the theater auditorium. And no weapons allowed.

"(CNN) -- There is a growing interest among U.S. foreign policy officials and scholars in deterring Iran; that is, in tolerating a nuclear armed Iran but keeping it at bay by threatening it in kind should it use its nuclear weapons. Although the Obama administration has not embraced this position, some observers believe this is the direction it is headed. One indication comes from Thomas Donilon, the national security adviser. In a speech late last year, he remarked, ""We will continue to build a regional defense architecture that prevents Iran from threatening its neighbors. We will continue to deepen Iran's isolation, regionally and globally."" And a recent report sponsored by the U.S. Air Force outlines a strategy for deterrence that includes expanding the United States' regional nuclear presence and improving American missile defense capabilities. As one expert puts it, ""Deterrence against a nuclear Iran should not be terribly difficult."" For deterrence to work, the leaders of the nations that command nuclear arms must be rational. The champions of deterrence claim to demonstrate that Iran's leaders are not insane by showing that they react in sensible ways to changes in the world around them. For instance, after the U.S. military easily wiped out Saddam Hussein's army in Iraq and President George W. Bush told Iran it was on the very short list of members in the ""Axis of Evil,"" Iran made a very conciliatory offer regarding its nuclear program. In short, proponents of deterrence argue that leaders and governments in fact do respond to changes with reason and logic. However, there's another type of decision-making process that sociologists have known about. It's nonrational behavior, such as when people act in response to deeply held beliefs that cannot be proven or disproven. People have long shown they are willing to kill or be killed for their beliefs, and that God commanded them to act in a particular manner. They may respond to facts and pressures, but only as long as those factors affect the ways they implement their beliefs -- but not the beliefs themselves. Thus, a religiously fanatical Iranian leader who believes that God commanded him to wipe out Tel Aviv may calculate whether to use missiles or bombers and in what season to attack, but not whether to heed God's command to destroy the infidels. An example of nonrational thinking is summed up best in these words: ""[Iran's] religious zealotry causes it to exaggerate the significance of issues that are, objectively speaking, only tangentially related to its interests. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, for instance, has no direct bearing on Iran's security, but much of the regime sees it as fundamental to Iranian interests and even to Iran's identity as a Muslim nation."" Even rational heads of states have shown themselves in the past to be fully capable of making gross miscalculations that cost them their lives, regimes and all they were fighting for. Hitler would fall in that category. Similarly, the Japanese, when they attacked Pearl Harbor, believed they would be able at least to drive the United States out of their part of the world. Saddam Hussein believed the United States would not invade Iraq in 2003, but he was dead wrong. History is littered with numerous other, though less grand, miscalculations, from Lord Cardigan's Charge of the Light Brigade in the Crimean War to Pickett's Charge in the American Civil War. In short, it might be possible to deter Iran, but no one can assume that we can safely rely on the rationality of Iran's leaders and their decisions and reactions to the events around them. No one can predict if they will unleash forces on Saudi Arabia or Israel -- perhaps not even the Iranians themselves. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- More than a week after Mexico's presidential election, the candidate who authorities describe as the runner-up said a partial recount was not enough to erase his doubts about the vote. ""We cannot accept these results,"" Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters Monday, vowing to file a formal complaint before a tribunal on Thursday, the legal deadline for challenging the election results. Lopez Obrador asserted that presumptive president-elect Enrique Peña Nieto and his party bought millions of votes in the election -- an accusation party officials have denied. ""I am president by the majority decision of the Mexicans,"" Peña Nieto told CNN last week, noting that numerous world leaders, including U.S. President Barack Obama, had called to congratulate him on his win. Peña Nieto to CNN: 'New debate' on drug war . An official tally of returns released after a partial recount by Mexico's Federal Election Institute last week confirmed that Peña Nieto of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, received 38.21% of votes. Lopez Obrador, of the Democratic Revolution Party, garnered 31.59% of votes, election officials said. The results remain unofficial until the country's electoral tribunal ratifies them. The tribunal will have until September 6 to complete its investigation and ratify -- or reverse -- the official election results. The new president will be sworn in December 1. Lopez Obrador has criticized the election and refused to concede repeatedly over the past week, echoing comments he made in 2006 when election authorities said the leftist candidate narrowly lost the presidential vote to Felipe Calderon. After that election, the former Mexico City mayor claimed election fraud and never conceded, referring to himself as ""the legitimate president of Mexico."" Lopez Obrador's supporters protested nationwide. In Mexico City, they organized sit-ins and blockades. Officials have called this year's election the most transparent in Mexico's history. It was the first election in which scanned copies of district-by-district election returns were posted on the Internet. But accusations have arisen of electoral manipulation by the PRI. Photos: Tensions follow Mexico election . Opponents of the PRI said they have video and photo evidence of the party buying votes through thousands of cards that could be redeemed for products at a chain of supermarkets. An anti-Peña Nieto youth movement said it received 1,100 complaints of irregularities. And the group Civic Alliance said 30% of voters it surveyed reported witnessing at least one type of irregularity. Mexican election regulators said they are investigating the allegations related to the gift cards. PRI spokesman Eduardo Sanchez has called the claims ""a farce,"" and accused political opponents of staging the videos and photographs purported to show vote-buying. CNNMexico.com's Tania L.

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Thousands of protesters marched along Jakarta's main thoroughfare to the presidential palace Wednesday, opposing government plans to increase subsidized fuel prices by 33%. According to police estimates, between 3,000 and 5,000 protestors participated in the largely peaceful march to reject the price hike, which is expected to take effect April 1. The fuel price hikes have triggered nationwide protests, mostly organized by student organizations and labor unions, the Jakarta Globe reported. In Makasser, capital of South Sulawesi and the largest city in east Indonesia, students clashed with anti-riot police and set a vehicle alight. More protests are expected in the days to come. Shubham Chaudhuri, a World Bank economist in Jakarta, says the government's plans will try to correct an imbalance in government spending. In 2011, the government spent 2.2% of GDP on fuel subsidies ""and 1.5% of GDP on infrastructure and 1% of GDP on what we would call social assistance programs,"" Chaudhri said yesterday. Indonesia's parliament has yet to approve the proposal but the government says a rise in fuel prices is necessary on April 1. The plan was announced last week and comes after global crude oil prices have steadily risen on growing tensions with Iran, rising more than 7% this year. Workers also marched in a separate protest Wednesday to the Ministry of Health building to demand better health benefits.","Thousands protested government plan to increase in fuel costs in Indonesia .

"(CNN) -- Kenyan park rangers are hunting for a gang of poachers who they say killed eleven elephants and hacked off their tusks, the latest large slaughter of the animals to be reported amid insatiable global demand for ivory. The family of elephants were killed on Saturday in Tsavo East National Park in southern Kenya, according to a statement Monday from the Kenya Wildlife Service. The animals' carcasses all had bullet wounds and their tusks had been chopped off, the agency said. Read more: African ivory worth $1.4 million seized in HK . Teams of rangers on foot and in the air are trying to track down the poachers in the 22,000-square-kilometer (8,500-square-mile) park, the country's largest single ecosystem, according to the wildlife service. It said it believed around 10 poachers were involved. The killing follows warnings last year from conservation groups that elephants were being slaughtered in Africa at an alarming rate to feed demand for ivory from increasingly affluent Asian countries, particularly China and Thailand. At the same time, the groups said, poachers are becoming more heavily armed, making it harder for often ill-equipped park wardens to protect the animals.

In an indication of the amount of illegal ivory in circulation, authorities in the Asian port of Hong Kong have announced three major seizures of smuggled shipments since October. They confiscated 779 pieces of tusk, worth the equivalent of about $1.4 million, last week. The Tsavo park, a protected area, is home to an estimated 13,000 elephants, based on a census in 2011, Kenya Wildlife Service said. A representative of the agency wasn't immediately available to comment Tuesday on the latest developments in the pursuit of the poachers. CNN's David McKenzie reported from Johannesburg, South Africa, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","The killing took place in Tasvo East National Park in southern Kenya .

"(CNN) -- Fearful of a crackdown on undocumented workers, thousands of Cambodian migrants clutching children and towing their possessions in sacks and plastic bags, milled into a train station. They crammed inside in an orderly fashion-- mostly nervous and solemn -- as they waited for the train that will take them back to Cambodia. ""They told me the Thai military would arrest us, and they would shoot,"" said Bo Sin, a Cambodian construction worker who was among those departing from the Thai border town of Aranyaprathet. When asked where he got this information, Bo Sin replied, ""It could be a rumor, people are passing along this information."" Many of the Cambodian workers echoed Bo Sin's fears. They say they're leaving because of talk of arrest and persecution -- unsubstantiated allegations that the Thai junta vehemently denies. But it has not stemmed the tide of Cambodian workers heading to the borders. About 140,000 migrant workers have fled Thailand causing bottleneck congestion at the border, said Joe Lowry, spokesman for the International Organization for Migration. ""I feel really afraid, and my mother also called me to return home,"" said Ban Sue, a Cambodian cook who had worked at a Bangkok restaurant. Thailand has been under the control of the military since a coup in late May. Although tackling illegal migration has been one of the junta's priorities, unease over the issue and the sudden change in government may have fueled the migrant workers' concerns. Thai officials say there is no crackdown on undocumented workers and that it has been spurred by ""groundless news reports based on rumors."" Neither the junta nor local authorities have issued orders concerning migrant workers, said Sek Wannamethee, spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand in a press release. ""The rumor which was spread by unknown sources has caused panic among both Cambodian workers as well as Thai employers,"" he said. ""Consequently, a number of Cambodian illegal workers have reported themselves to the Thai authorities to be repatriated voluntarily to Cambodia."" There has been no use of force or killings, Sek Wannamethee said. It remains unclear where talk of a clampdown originated. The International Organization of Migration, an intergovernmental group, estimates there are 150,000 Cambodian undocumented migrants in Thailand with the majority of them working in construction or agriculture. Thailand is believed to have about two million documented foreign migrant workers from countries including Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos who work in low-paying jobs that Thais are unwilling to do, according to a news service for the U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Foreign workers are often vulnerable to police harassment and exploitation, advocates say. ""Many of these people are severely economically disadvantaged and have spent all their savings, if they had any, to get this far,"" said Brett Dickson, IOM's team leader in Poi Pet, Cambodia, in a news release. In recent decades, relations between Cambodia and Thailand have been dogged by border issues, tensions over an area surrounding the ancient Preah Vihear temple, and the 2003 burning of the Thai embassy in Phnom Penh by rioters.

"(CNN) -- The 2010 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded Friday to Liu Xiaobo, a leading Chinese dissident who is serving an 11-year prison term after repeatedly calling for human rights and democratization, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced. Liu was sentenced in 2009 for inciting subversion of state power. He is the co-author of Charter 08, a call for political reform and human rights, and was an adviser to the student protesters at Tiananmen Square in 1989. Liu's wife, Liu Xia, told CNN she could not wait to visit him in prison in northern China and tell him the news. She said she was packing under the surveillance of police officers who promised to take her to visit her husband the next day. ""I am totally shocked and feel so happy,"" she said. ""I've never dreamed about this. Friends have asked me to prepare for a speech, but I've only prepared one for Xiaobo not winning the prize."" Liu Xia said she regretted her husband couldn't share the moment with her. She said he would be ""surprised and humbled"" to find out, but would also feel ""a greater sense of responsibilities"" because of the great honor. ""It's an affirmation of what he has fought for,"" she said. Liu Xiaobo's longtime friend Pu Zhiqiang said he wasn't sure whether to be happy or cry when he heard the news. ""I doubt the Nobel will help Xiaobo right this moment, but in the long run it will leave a legacy that is sure to help bring democratic reform and freedom to China, that will far outlast Liu's life,"" Pu told CNN outside the gates of Liu's apartment complex. Liu's lawyer, Shang Baojun, said the win may mean Liu will have to be in prison longer. ""I hope that he'd be released earlier because of the prize, but in reality, that will not happen,"" Shang told CNN. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said the awarding of the prize to Liu was ""blasphemy against the peace prize"" that could harm relations between China and Norway. ""Liu Xiaobo is a convicted criminal sentenced to jail by Chinese justice. His acts are in complete contradiction to the purpose of the Nobel Peace Prize,"" spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said. The human rights group Amnesty International called on the Chinese government to release all ""prisoners of conscience"" following the win. ""Liu Xiaobo is a worthy winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. We hope it will keep the spotlight on the struggle for fundamental freedoms and concrete protection of human rights that Liu Xiaobo and many other activists in China are dedicated to,"" said Catherine Baber, the deputy Asia-Pacific director at Amnesty International. U.S. President Barack Obama, who won the award last year, said Liu had sacrificed his freedom for his beliefs. Liu, he said, is an ""eloquent and courageous spokesman for the advance of universal values through peaceful and non-violent means, including his support for democracy, human rights, and the rule of law."" Obama also urged China to release Liu as soon as possible. It was unclear whether Liu had learned of his prize from prison, but he was the favorite of many around the world to win. The president of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Thorbjoern Jagland, said Liu won for his ""long and nonviolent struggle for fundamental human rights in China."" In announcing the prize, he said, ""The Norwegian Nobel Committee has long believed that there is a close connection between human rights and peace. Such rights are a prerequisite for the fraternity between nations of which [prize founder] Alfred Nobel wrote in his will."" Liu's struggle has made him the ""foremost symbol"" of the struggle for human rights in his country, Jagland said. Despite the criticism from China, the committee stood by its choice and said it had expected China to react strongly. ""We have a very strong tradition of awarding the prize to human rights activists of many different kinds,"" Geir Lundestad, director of the Nobel Institute, told CNN. The institute assists the committee in selecting the prize each year. Lundestad cited German pacifist and journalist Carl von Ossietsky in 1935, Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel in 1986, Myanmar pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi in 1991, and Iranian campaigner Shirin Ebadi in 2003 as examples of human rights activists who have won the prize. ""This is a tradition we are very proud of, and this is a tradition for which the Norwegian Nobel Committee has received much applause,"" Lundestad said. ""We felt that if we were serious about this tradition, we did have to come to terms with the question of China in this perspective, and this is what we then did this year."" The winner of the Nobel Peace Prize receives 10 million Swedish kronor ($1.5 million), to be picked up at the award ceremony in December. Liu spoke of his work in 2007, while he was between a series of house arrests. ""From my personal angle, I feel in a dictatory society if you want to be a person with dignity, if you want to be an honest person, fight for human-rights improvement, fight for free speech, being ... [in prison] is part of what you are undertaking, and there is nothing to complain,"" he told CNN. ""Since you chose to do this, you must have a preparation for being in prison,"" he said. ""Entering the prison you must face these things peacefully, not complain [about] others. I even don't complain [about those] ... who arrested me, because this is their inevitable action. I can also not let them arrest me if I chose other way."" Twitter users in China were unable to discuss Liu or the Nobel Prize on the micro-blogging site, but some still reacted to the award. ""I am so excited when I heard this news! Finally good people is recognized by the world!"" wrote one Twitter user. ""They censored what I've just posted on micro blog! Can you really stop people in this Internet age!"" wrote another. At least two international television networks -- CNN and BBC -- were blacked out as the Nobel Committee announced the winner, and CNN remained blacked out for most of the day. Pu, Liu's friend, was refused entry to the apartment complex by security guards when he went there Friday night. A human rights lawyer and partner in the Huayi Law Firm in Beijing -- where he focuses on defamation, press freedom and other public interest law -- Pu said the prize is a step forward for Chinese development. ""Liu's Nobel Prize shows that he will have an impact beyond how far the eye can see. This will change the future long into the future,"" he told CNN, adding that Liu is ""like an older brother to me."" Liu's sentencing prompted a groundswell of support from former Peace Prize laureates and perennial contenders. Vaclav Havel, the hero of Czechoslovakia's 1989 Velvet Revolution (who never won the Nobel Prize), retired South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu (who did, in 1984), and the Dalai Lama (1989) were among a group of intellectuals who publicly urged the Nobel Committee to give the prize to Liu shortly after he was sentenced. American writer Kwame Anthony Appiah, the head of the American PEN center, a literary and human rights organization, nominated Liu in January, he said. ""Liu Xiaobo is a hero among heroes,"" said Rep. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, who also nominated him. ""This award will be a shot of adrenaline for all Chinese human rights advocates and prisoners of conscience."" The Wall Street Journal reported in February that Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma said that it would be ""totally wrong"" for ""such a person"" to win the Nobel Peace Prize, and that the comment was later scrubbed from the official transcript of the briefing. CNN's Jo Ling Kent and Steven Jiang, and journalist Tomas Etzler, contributed to this report.","Wife: ""I've never dreamed about this""

"(CNN) -- Alex Ferguson is the legendary Manchester United coach who once sent a boot flying into the face of David Beckham, but a British sculptor has revealed a softer side to the formidable Scot. Ferguson recently celebrated 26 years as United's manager this week, during which time he has won trophies at home and abroad as well as gaining a fierce reputation for the ""hairdryer treatment"" he dishes out to his players. But that was not the man sculptor Philip Jackson encountered after being commissioned to produce a nine-foot bronze statue of Ferguson which was unveiled on Friday with a host of United legends in attendance. ""He's a very interesting character,"" Jackson, based in the English county of Sussex, told CNN when asked about the 70-year-old United boss. ""He's much more than you seen on the television. ""When he came down to the studio he said, 'Did you know that Gore Vidal had died?' and 'Have you read the new biography of Charles de Gaulle?' He's a very well-read man."" Over the last quarter of a century, Ferguson has overseen United's ascent to the top of English football. The Old Trafford team has won 12 league titles under his stewardship, helping it to a record 19 English championships overall, in addition to two European Champions League triumphs. Benign expression . Raised in the working-class district of Govan in Glasgow, the 70-year-old Ferguson is a staunch supporter of the British Labour Party. As a manager Ferguson has a no-nonsense reputation, letting go of top players like Beckham, Roy Keane, Jaap Stam and Ruud van Nistelrooy when he senses they have outlived their usefulness to the United cause. A long-running spat with the BBC saw Ferguson refuse to speak with the British broadcaster for seven years after a 2004 documentary made unproven allegations of wrongdoing against his football agent son Jason. But fellow Scotsman Jackson wanted to capture a different side of Ferguson for the sculpture which was unveiled during a ceremony ahead of Saturday's match with Queens Park Rangers -- the team he faced in his first match in charge at Old Trafford in 1986. ""I wanted him to have a slightly benign expression on his face, so that's what he's got. He's wearing the sort of clothes he would wear at a match in the winter."" Amalgam . Jackson was already known to United's hierarchy after producing sculptures of former manager Matt Busby and the legendary playing trio of George Best, Bobby Charlton and Denis Law. ""I'd already done the Matt Busby sculpture for Manchester United some 12-15 years ago,"" said Jackson, who in his role as royal sculptor has produced works ranging from the archangel Gabriel and Constantine the Great to the young Mozart. ""I did the United trinity of Best, Charlton and Law and when that was completed we talked about doing Alex. I didn't do anything immediately. ""There was an opportunity when his 25th anniversary came up and they decided to name a stand after him. So it was decided it should be done to go in front of that."" In order to do justice to a man as respected as Ferguson, Jackson built up an in-depth knowledge of his personality and appearance during several meetings. ""I went up to see him, took a lot of photographs of him and spent some time watching him at a match,"" explained Jackson, who also produced a sculpture of England's World Cup-winning squad of 1966 which is outside Wembley Stadium. ""I got a lot of photographs from the Manchester United archives and also a lot of books that had been written about him. ""To start of piece of sculpture is almost like researching for a book, you have to get to know the person very well. ""It's an amalgam of everything I've seen of him and the meetings I've had with him. I've done him fairly pensive. He often stands on the edge of the pitch deciding on what's going to happen next. That's the moment I've chosen to record."" When capturing a character like Ferguson, how did Jackson select one stationary pose to epitomize a coach who is most often seen wildly gesticulating from the sidelines? ""I imagine him standing on the touchline in deep concentration, about to say something to the team which is going to change the tactics somewhat,"" he replied. ""One of the things he does is when the team has won or someone has scored a goal, he tends to put his hands in the air and wave them backwards and forwards. ""That's a very good pose for film, but it's not a good pose for sculpture as it makes him look like he's surrendering."" Ancient tradition . Sports stars have long been the subject of works of art, with the athletes of ancient Greece often honored with carvings and statues. ""Sports sculptures, the tradition goes back to Greco-Roman times,"" said Jackson. ""If you look at Greek sculpture, it's all of athletes or people who took part in the Games. It is carrying on a very long tradition."" There are practical advantages of depicting sportsmen for sculptors. ""They have generally come to a job through being young, athletic sportsmen,"" added Jackson. ""The theme of fitness continues throughout their life. It makes them easier to sculpt because their bodies are well proportioned."" The sculpture of Ferguson will be the latest in a long line of monuments proudly displayed by English football clubs. Ferguson's fellow Scot Bill Shankly has a tribute outside Liverpool's Anfield Stadium for the three league titles he won for the club between 1964 and 1973. Newcastle United unveiled a statue of much-loved former manager Bobby Robson earlier this year. Robson, England's coach during the 1990 World Cup, was a native of the north east and occupied the Newcastle hotseat for five years.","Alex Ferguson will be honored with a statue outside Man Utd's stadium .

"(CNN) -- A Somali terror leader implored his fellow countryman in California to send money 'to finance jihad,"" triggering a chain of events that ended with four convictions. U.S. government agents recorded dozens of such calls a few years ago, according to the Department of Justice. And on Friday, a jury found four Somali nationals guilty of supporting terrorism in their native country. The verdict came after prosecutors played the recordings to jurors in a San Diego federal court during weeks of trial. The four, who included an imam and a cab driver, had raised $10,000 and wired it to the Islamist terrorist group Al-Shabaab, according to the original indictment. Cab driver Basaaly Saeed Moalin had many phone conversations with former Al-Shabaab leader Aden Hashi Ayrow, before a U.S. missile strike ended the latter's life in May 2008. Investigators from the FBI, Homeland Security and a San Diego anti-terror agency recorded dozens of them. Federal prosecutors filed charges in November 2011. The group pleaded not guilty. But the recordings convinced the jurors otherwise. Read the case file (pdf) The money wasn't coming fast enough for Ayrow, who implored Moalin in at least one recorded call to hurry it up. ""You are running late with the stuff,"" Ayrow told him. ""Send some, and something will happen."" Ayrow pushed the cab driver to get his local imam to come up with some funds. Mohamed Mohamed Mohamud ran the City Heights mosque in San Diego, which many in the Somali community attended. Together with a second cab driver, Ahmed Nasiri Taalil Mohamud, and an employee at a money transfer company, Issa Doreh, they raised the cash and wired it to Al-Shabaab , the Justice Department said. It wasn't the only favor Moalin did for the terror group. Moalin had kept a house in Somalia's capital Mogadishu, one of the world's most embattled cities at the time.

The Islamist extremists have been waging a war against Somalia's government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or sharia. In recent years, Somali and African Union troops, who have received funding from the U.S. government, have won many battles against the terror group, pushing it back to a handful of strongholds. For more than 20 years, Somalia did not have a stable government, and fighting between the rebels and government troops added to the impoverished east African nation's humanitarian crisis. In January, the United States granted official recognition to the Somali government in Mogadishu.","San Diego jury convicts four Somalis after hearing recorded phone calls with terror leader .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived Thursday in Afghanistan to speed up a resolution to the country's election dispute, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. Kerry will be meeting with presidential candidates Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani and President Hamid Karzai. The visit comes two days after Maj. Gen. Harold Greene -- a longtime officer who was leading efforts to train soldiers in Afghanistan -- was killed at a military training facility in Kabul. Kerry recently brokered an agreement between the nation's two presidential candidates to accept the outcome of an audit of the election. Preliminary results from the June runoff showed Ghani in the lead, but Abdullah alleged massive election fraud. The inauguration of the President, originally scheduled for the first week of August, was postponed while the votes are recounted. ""The secretary will follow up on his July visit to Kabul and his subsequent phone calls to the candidates, encouraging both to help accelerate the audit process which they are both participating in, and make progress on the details of the political framework that they agreed to during the Secretary's last visit,"" Psaki said in a statement. ""The Secretary will encourage both candidates to work together in the spirit of collegiality and statesmanship, to ensure national unity and the means to build on the progress the Afghan people have achieved.""

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama heads south of the border Thursday to meet with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto in the country's capital. Here are three key topics that are likely to be on the table, and a look at how the leaders and Mexicans have weighed in on those issues. 1. Trade and economic ties . The situation: . The United States is Mexico's largest trading partner, and Mexico is America's third-largest trade partner, after China and Canada. Imports and exports between the two countries totaled nearly $500 billion last year. Officials on both sides of the border have said they want economic relations to be a focal point during Obama's visit. Obama's trip comes as Peña Nieto's government has said it's on the verge of pursuing reforms in the country's state-run oil company -- a politically divisive issue in Mexico and something U.S. and global investors are watching closely. Obama's take: . ""We spend so much time on security issues between the United States and Mexico that sometimes I think we forget this is a massive trading partner, responsible for huge amounts of commerce and huge numbers of jobs on both sides of the border,"" Obama told reporters on Tuesday. ""We want to see how we can deepen that, how we can improve that, and maintain that economic dialogue over a long period of time."" Peña Nieto's take: . ""We should reconsider greater integration of North America to achieve a region that is more competitive and capable of creating more jobs,"" Peña Nieto told Obama during a meeting at the White House in November. Public opinion: . Most Mexicans think the deep economic ties between the two countries are good for Mexico, according to survey results released this week by the Pew Research Center. But when the 1,000 people surveyed in March were asked about the influence the United States currently has on economic conditions in Mexico, views were mixed. One-third of Mexicans say the United States is having a positive impact on national economic conditions in Mexico, while 28% think the United States is having a negative impact. 2. Immigration . The situation: . The United States and Mexico are bound by a border which has made for a dysfunctional relationship over the years, especially when it comes to immigration. However, both governments have the issue high on their list of priorities. In the United States, a bipartisan group of senators have proposed an immigration reform bill, with U.S.-Mexico border security at its foundation. There are more than 11 million Mexicans living in the United States, including the 6 million estimated to be living there illegally as of 2010. But the migration rate from Mexico fell to zero in 2012, meaning the number of Mexicans coming to the United States -- and those going the other way -- was virtually identical. Obama's take: . ""We've got to have more effective border security; although it should build on the great improvements that have been made on border security over the last four or five years,"" Obama said in a news conference this week. ""We should make the legal immigration system work more effectively so that the waits are not as burdensome, the bureaucracy is not as complicated, so we continue to attract the best and the brightest from around the world to our shores in a legal fashion."" Peña Nieto's take: . ""We fully support your proposal for this migration reform,"" Peña Nieto told Obama in November. ""More than demanding what you should do or shouldn't do, we do want to tell you that we want to contribute. We really want to participate with you. We want to contribute toward the accomplishment, so that of course we can participate in the betterment and the well-being of so many millions of people who live in your country."" Public opinion: . According to the Pew Research Center, Mexicans are divided on whether this is good or bad for their country; 44% say it's good for Mexico that many of its citizens live in the United States, and an equal share say this is bad for Mexico. And, perhaps the most surprising find from the study said that 61% of Mexicans would not move to the United States even if they had the means to do so. However, 35% say they would move to the United States if they could, including 20% who say they would emigrate without authorization. A little less than a third of the Mexicans questioned (30%) say they personally know someone who went to the United States but returned to Mexico because the person couldn't find work, according to the Pew Research Center. About a quarter (27%) know someone who has been deported or detained by the U.S. government for immigration reasons in the last 12 months. 3. Security and the drug war . The situation: . The battle against drug cartels has played a dominant role in U.S.-Mexican relations in recent years. Officials on both sides of the border have said that drugs traveling north from Mexico to consumers in the United States and weapons traveling south from the United States to cartels in Mexico are an increasingly deadly combination. High-profile cartel takedowns were a hallmark of former President Felipe Calderon's tenure. Peña Nieto has vowed to take a different approach, focusing more on education problems and social inequality that he says fuel drug violence. The details of his policies are still coming into focus, and analysts say his government has deliberately tried to shift drug violence out of the spotlight. Critics have expressed concerns that Peña Nieto's government will turn a blind eye to cartels or negotiate with them -- something he repeatedly denied on the campaign trail last year. On Tuesday -- two days before Obama's arrival -- his government arrested the father-in-law of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, head of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel and one of the country's most-wanted drug lords. While both Obama and Peña Nieto have said they're committed to working together on security issues, it's unclear whether the U.S. role will change as Mexico's government shifts its strategy. Obama's take: . The U.S. president has repeatedly said the United States will work to reduce demand for drugs and to stop the illegal flow of weapons to Mexico. But there's one approach he says isn't on the table -- drug legalization. Speaking at the Summit of the Americas in Colombia last year, Obama said it was reasonable to debate alternatives in the war on drugs, but insisted legalizing drugs is not a valid option in the United States. ""I think it is entirely legitimate to have a conversation about whether the laws in place are doing more harm than good in certain places,"" Obama said. ""I personally, and my administration's position is, that legalization is not the answer."" Peña Nieto's take: . Last year, Peña Nieto told CNN that creating more economic opportunities will be Mexico's greatest weapon in the war on drugs. ""That, I think, is going to be the best way my government can prevent organized crime,"" he said. Without jobs and social programs, he added, ""millions of my countrymen have no other option than to dedicate themselves sometimes to criminal activity."" Public opinion: . Nearly a third of Mexicans surveyed by Pew say Mexico's government is losing ground against cartels, while 37% say the government is making progress. Mexican public opinion is mixed over the U.S. role in the fight against drug cartels, according to the Pew survey. Nearly three-quarters of Mexicans surveyed said they would welcome U.S. assistance in training Mexican police and military personnel. But support for the United States providing money and weapons to Mexican forces has lost some support in recent years, Pew said. In 2011, 64% of those surveyed said they backed such a strategy. This year, 55% said they supported that approach. CNN's Rafael Romo contributed to this report.","Obama and Peña Nieto have said they want to focus on the economy this week .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush lifted an executive order banning offshore oil drilling on Monday and urged Congress to follow suit. If President Bush can persuade Congress, more oil rigs like this one off Canada could appear off U.S. shores. Citing the high prices Americans are paying at the pump, Bush said from the White House Rose Garden that allowing offshore oil drilling is ""one of the most important steps we can take"" to reduce that burden. However, the move is largely symbolic as there is also a federal law banning offshore drilling. ""This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress,"" Bush said.  Watch Bush announce lifting of ban » . Bush has been pushing Congress to repeal the law passed in 1981. ""There is no excuse for delay,"" the president said in a Rose Garden statement last month. iReport.com: Is drilling the answer? ""In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil, and that means we need to increase supply here at home,"" Bush said, adding that there is no more pressing issue for many Americans than gas prices. Bush's father, President George H.W. Bush, signed the executive order in 1990 banning offshore drilling.  See where offshore drilling is allowed » . The issue has gained prominence in the presidential race. Sen. John McCain recently announced he supported offshore oil drilling, reversing his previous stance. Sen. Barack Obama wants to keep the ban in place. Experts say offshore oil drilling would not have an immediate impact on oil prices because oil exploration takes years. ""If we were to drill today, realistically speaking, we should not expect a barrel of oil coming out of this new resource for three years, maybe even five years, so let's not kid ourselves,"" said Fadel Gheit, oil and gas analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. Equity Capital Markets Division. But it almost certainly would be profitable. Candida Scott, an oil industry researcher at Cambridge Research Associates, said oil needs to be priced at $60 a barrel or more to justify deep-shelf drilling. With oil now selling for $145 a barrel, companies are almost assured of profiting from offshore drilling, Scott said. In his statement last month, Bush also renewed his demand that Congress allow drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, clear the way for more refineries and encourage efforts to recover oil from shale in areas such as the Green River Basin of Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. The White House estimates that there are 18 billion barrels of oil offshore that have not been exploited because of state bans, 10 billion to 12 billion in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and 800 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the Green River Basin.","End to executive ban on offshore drilling does not affect separate federal law .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney step into a more free-wheeling town-hall style debate on Tuesday night, a setting that has given the two coolly intellectual candidates some trouble in the past. Both will have to recalibrate their approaches from their first encounter on Oct. 3, which was won by Romney. ""I think Obama assumes he will do better in town hall debates because he has an advantage on empathy,"" said Emory University political science professor Andra Gillespie, adding that Obama is going to have to ""show a little more passion and fire in his belly."" Five things to watch for in tonight's debate . Romney could be less aggressive, which earned him points in the first debate, and focus more on trying to narrow the likability gap. ""Because Romney is gaffe-prone he is going to do everything he can to come across as warm and empathetic, Gillespie said. CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley will moderate the second debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. She is first woman to do so in two decades. The town hall format presents challenges and opportunities for the candidates, Crowley said. Both have held a number of town hall forums during the campaign season â€” exchanges that haven't exactly sizzled, political experts say. Crowley on moderating town hall debate: 'It's harder to dodge' That's because Obama tends to become professorial and Romney stiff in such settings. ""The danger of the town hall is that you're getting (questions) from the audience,"" said Melissa Wade, a debate professor at Emory University. ""It's either because they're either not good or they are so rehearsed the responder has a hard time."" Other candidates have struggled in town halls. Television cameras caught then-President George H.W. Bush when he looked at his watch during a town hall debate in 1992. In 2000, Vice President Al Gore got in GOP rival George W. Bush personal space which made for an awkward moment. The unpredictable nature of the questions also has perils, she said. In 2004, President George W. Bush struggled to answer a woman's question on three wrong decisions that he'd made. That debate was also full of testy back and forth â€” the types of exchanges that spell trouble for politicians, political experts say. In the last presidential town hall debate, GOP nominee John McCain wandered across stage while Obama, then a senator, answered a question. ""I worry for Romney that this is where he gets excitable. I wish someone would tell him to count to three before he opens his mouth. Informal leads to more quips,"" Wade said. ""Excitability is not likability."" 10 debate moments that mattered . Though according to polls Obama ranks higher in the likability department, he, too, struggles in town halls. ""It's his worst format,"" Wade said. ""It was not as pronounced as McCain wandering around. Obama in a town hall is more long winded. He just can't help himself."" Obama came up against his long winded nature during a CNBC town hall event in 2010 when then-Obama supporter Velma Hart told the president she was ""exhausted"" from defending him. Instead of answering Hart's question directly, Obama talked around it for four minutes. The candidates also will have to work to connect with both the television viewing audience watching at home and the group of voters sitting in the room. ""They are going to have roughly 80 people, as I understand it, looking at them in addition to me. You know and I know it is very easy for politicians to run over a reporter â€” they don't care,"" Crowley said. ""There is no price to be paid for being rude to a reporter, not answering the question. But 80 undecided voters looking at you, and some of them getting up and going, ""Well, what about this?"" It's just harder to dodge."" iReport: Share your questions for Candy . A CNN/ORC survey conducted just after the first debate suggests that it didn't change opinions of the president. Forty-nine percent of debate watchers said they had a favorable opinion of Obama before the event, and that number didn't change afterward. It was pretty much a similar story for Romney, whose favorable rating among debate watchers edged up two points, from 54% before to 56% after. Still, both could use the less predictable nature of the town hall setting to their advantage, political experts say. ""This town hall forum offers President Obama a chance to communicate in a different way than has been expected and more effectively. Everyone expects him to come out swinging. ... I think it would be more creative and effective if he focuses on audience members and the middle class and his plans for the future and why they are more effective than his opposition,"" said David Gergen, a senior political analyst for CNN. Romney too could use his strengths to score points. ""Romney's strength is dignity,"" Gergen said, adding that the GOP nominee seemed to relish and fare well when he was on the offensive during the first debate. ""He's got to bring the same level of energy and go more indirectly with the president through the person he's talking to."" Get instant updates on CNN's live blog .

"Madrid (CNN) -- A 25-year-old Spanish man has been ordered by a judge to leave home and look for a job after he took his parents to court for stopping his allowance money. The man from Andalusia in southern Spain had taken the court action demanding a monthly allowance of $588 after his parents stopped giving him his spending money unless he tried to find a job. However, the judge told the man, who has not been named in court documents, that he must leave his parents' house within 30 days. The judge said the man was studying law, albeit at a slow rate, and would probably not complete the degree for several years, but he thought he was still capable of finding some kind of work. The family court in Malaga says the situation at the home had seriously deteriorated with the parents claiming their son had physically and verbally assaulted them. The man's mother works in a restaurant while his father works for a garbage collection firm. The judge also ordered that the parents should pay a $292 monthly food stipend for 2 years. The parents have also taken over the monthly repayments on their son's car. In Spain it is not unusual for offspring to remain living with their parents until well into their 30s, a trend strengthened by a tough labor market where the youth unemployment rate is 40.5%, the highest in the European Union. There are 4.6 million Spaniards unemployed, and 1.3 million Spanish homes with no one in work, according to government figures for the fourth quarter of 2010.","25-year-old had taken parents to court demanding $588 monthly allowance .

"(CNN) -- Iran is more than a year away from developing a nuclear weapon, but that does not mean the United States will wait for it to become a reality, President Barack Obama said in an interview that aired Thursday on an Israeli television station. ""I have been crystal clear about my position on Iran possessing a nuclear weapon. That is a red line for us. It is not only something that would be dangerous for Israel. It would be dangerous for the world,"" Obama told CNN affiliate Israeli Channel 2 TV before a scheduled visit next week to the country. ""...I've also said there is a window -- not an infinite period time, but a window of time -- where we can resolve this diplomatically."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly called on Obama to establish a clear line that Iran cannot cross with its nuclear program, if it wants to avoid war. Obama has resisted such a move, and Netanyahu has shown growing impatience with what he has previously called a lack of clarity by the Obama administration on articulating red lines over Iran's nuclear ambitions. U.S. intelligence officials have said they do not believe Iran has decided to develop a nuclear weapon, even as evidence continues to mount that the country is improving its ability to do so. No 'chest beating' on Iran, but Obama issues challenge . Iran denies that it aims to build a nuclear bomb, saying that its nuclear program is for energy and medical use. ""Right now, we think that it would take over a year or so for Iran to actually develop a nuclear weapon,"" Obama told Channel 2. The interview was conducted Wednesday in Washington, the channel said. ""But obviously, we don't want to cut it too close. What we are going to do is to continue to engage internationally with Iran."" Obama also said he believes that the international economic sanctions, some of the ""strongest"" ever imposed against Tehran, are having an effect on the country. ""They are not yet at the point, I think, where they've made a fundamental decision to get right with the international community,"" the president said. ""But I do think they are recognizing that there is a severe cost for them to continue down the path they are on and that there's another door open."" Obama said his message to Netanyahu during his visit to Israel would be much the same as it has previously been. ""If we can resolve it diplomatically, that's a more lasting solution. If not, I continue to keep all options on the table,"" he said. When pushed during the interview to define those options, the president responded: ""When I say all options are on the table, all options are on the table. The United States obviously has significant capabilities."" He said the goal is to ensure that Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon that could threaten Israel or trigger a possible arms race in the region. Official: Cyberattacks top U.S. threats . United States-Israel relationship . Obama's three-day visit to Israel next week is widely viewed as an opportunity for the president to relay the United States' commitment to Israel and its security. It is his first trip to Israel since being elected president. He has visited the country three times, the last as a U.S. senator. The relationship between Netanyahu and Obama has been reportedly tense in large part because of their differences over major issues such as Iran's nuclear development and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Obama downplayed the tension between the two leaders but conceded that relations between his administration and Netanyahu's government have not always been sunny. ""There are conservative views both here in the United States and in Israel that may not jibe with mine, particularly when there is an election season coming up,"" he said. During last year's presidential election, Netanyahu and other Israeli officials painted Obama's challenger, Mitt Romney, as a stronger proponent of Israel and its security. Israel's new government excludes ultra-religious . Israeli-Palestinian peace . Obama said he plans to meet not only with Netanyahu and Israeli government but also with the Palestinian Authority's president, Mahmoud Abbas, and its prime minister, Salam Fayyad. Obama has repeatedly said he backs a two-state solution. ""It's not a matter of unilateral concessions. It's a matter of both parties coming together and recognizing that their futures will be inextricably linked and that Israel will be safer, more secure, more prosperous, if the issue can be resolved,"" he said. ""And, obviously, Israel can't resolve it by itself. But it can't stop trying."" U.S. commander says Iran sanctions not working . American spy . Obama also is likely to face questions during his visit about the possible release of convicted spy Jonathan Pollard, a U.S. citizen sentenced to life in prison for giving American military secrets to Israel. Pollard was a civilian intelligence analyst for the U.S. Navy when he was arrested in 1985 on charges that he provided secrets to the Israelis. He pleaded guilty to one count of espionage. The Israeli government, which has acknowledged that Pollard was its spy, granted him citizenship and has been lobbying for his release. But while he is considered a patriot by the Israeli government, Pollard has been turned down for clemency by Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. ""I have no plans of releasing Jonathan Pollard immediately,"" Obama said during the interview. The president also did not commit to reviewing the case other than to ensure that Pollard, as a U.S. citizen, is ""accorded the same kind of review"" given to all Americans.

"(CNN) -- Ethnic Uyghur residents in Urumqi, capital of China's far west Xinjiang region, took to the streets Sunday afternoon in a rare public protest that prompted a police lockdown of the city. China's official Xinhua News Agency said protesters attacked passersby, burned public buses and blocked traffic. The report did not say how many people took part in the protest or what their grievances were. But a witness in Urumqi told CNN that, soon after the protest started around 5 p.m., ""hundreds [of protesters] grew into easily over a thousand -- men, women and children, all ethnic Uyghurs, screaming and chanting."" Local police arrived quickly and tried to control the swelling crowd by erecting barriers in the street, but ""people pushed them over,"" the witness said. ""They were throwing rocks at passing cars and buses."" As the violence escalated, hundreds of anti-riot police arrived on the scene, the witness said. ""They used tear gas and fire hoses to disperse the crowd. I saw fire trucks, ambulances, armed personnel carriers, and what looked like tanks. I heard random gunshots."" Late Sunday, the witness said Urumqi was in a lockdown, with hundreds of People's Liberation Army soldiers in the streets. He reported seeing riot police chasing protesters into alleyways and rounding up ""many"" of them. The witness speculated that the protest, which took place in the predominantly Uyghur-populated Bazaar district, may have been a reaction to racial violence in southern Guangdong province. The racial violence reportedly happened at a toy factory in Guangdong Province, where many migrants, including Uyghurs, have moved in search of work. A massive brawl reportedly broke out between workers of Uyghur and Han nationalities. Two Uyghurs reportedly died in the violent clash. Xinjiang is home to many Uyghurs. China's constitution guarantees ethnic minorities equal rights and limited autonomy. However, ethnic tensions run deep. Minority groups like the Uyghurs complain that they are treated as second-class citizens and are subjected to discrimination by the majority Han nationalities. ""What was clear was the Uyghur protesters were not happy,"" the witness in Urumqi said. ""They broke windows of public buses, threw bottles and rocks at the police and harassed what looked like Chinese of Han or Hui nationalities. I saw a Uyghur man kick a Han woman in the behind as she tried to get away from the crowds."" It was not clear, from official reports or the witness' account, if there were any casualties. A spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress, a dissident Uyghur group based in Munich, Germany, told CNN that local Uyghur people in Urumqi and Xinjiang had told him by telephone that they had seen bodies thrown into military vehicles. Dilxat Raxit added that tens of thousands of demonstrators had gathered in every Uyghur neighborhood in Urumqi to protest peacefully against what he described as the government's ethnic cleansing in Guangdong Shaoguan. After about 40 minutes during which the crowd shouted slogans, calling the incident in Guangdong Shaoguan a planned ethnic cleansing, the Chinese military began to crack down by sending more than 50 military vehicles -- including tanks -- carrying troops into Urumqi. All Uyghurs were ordered off the street, he said. Sources in Kashgar said a ""massive number"" of Chinese PLA forces entered that city as well, and that students were ordered to remain inside. People were also arrested along roads leading to Urumqi, he said. ""According to the Chinese law, people have the right to protest peacefully,"" the World Uyghur Congress said in an appeal. ""We call for attention to this kind of ethnic discrimination.""","Ethnic Uyghur residents in Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang region, take to the streets .

"(CNN) -- Before he died, Heath Ledger had two films in production: ""The Dark Knight,"" the latest chapter in the Batman saga, and ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus,"" the latest film from director Terry Gilliam. Heath Ledger's Joker character, here on the ""Dark Knight"" poster, is the focus of the film's marketing effort. Ledger's death has affected both of them in different ways. The actor, who died Tuesday of unknown causes at age 28, had finished filming ""The Dark Knight"" late last year. It's due to be released in July. But marketing of the film, currently in post-production, has been thrown into turmoil, the trade paper Variety notes. The early push for the film has focused on Ledger's villainous Joker character, including a poster with a shrouded Joker scrawling ""Why So Serious?"" in blood on misty glass. The film's studio, Warner Bros., recently restructured its marketing department, Variety reports, after the departure of the executive who helped create the ""Dark Knight"" campaign. (Warner Bros., like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.) The trade paper speculates that the marketing campaign will be changed abruptly. The studio put out a statement Tuesday saying it was ""stunned and devastated"" by the news of Ledger's death. ""The entertainment community has lost an enormous talent. Heath was a brilliant actor and an exceptional person. Our hearts go out to his family and friends,"" the statement said.  Watch colleagues' memories of Heath Ledger » . With the Joker, Ledger was taking on a role that Jack Nicholson had rendered indelibly in 1989's ""Batman."" But ""Dark Knight"" director Christopher Nolan said the actor had more than measured up to Nicholson. ""To be perfectly honest ... what he's doing is indescribable. He's figured it out,"" Nolan told the crowd at an August comic book convention in Chicago.  Interactive: The life of Heath Ledger » . The role as arch villain The Joker disturbed Ledger, according to The Associated Press. He called the character a ""psychopathic, mass-murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy."" Although unusual, Ledger's death does not mark the first time a major star has died while a film has been in production. Perhaps the most famous example is James Dean, who died in September 1955, before post-production on ""Giant"" had finished. Dean's dialogue in the film's final scene had to be re-recorded, Variety observes, because he had mumbled in the shot. (Dean and director George Stevens famously clashed during filming.) Dean was nominated for an Oscar for his performance, his second posthumous Oscar nomination after ""East of Eden."" Brandon Lee died during filming of 1994's ""The Crow,"" prompting director Alex Proyas to use a stunt double and special effects. Oliver Reed had a heart attack during the making of 2000's ""Gladiator""; technology made it possible for director Ridley Scott to use a double as a stand-in with Reed's face computer-generated in. Gilliam's film, which concerns prime Gilliam material such as a magic mirror, a traveling show, the devil and a rougish character played by Ledger, is more problematic. The cast had just completed filming in London, which actor Christopher Plummer characterized as ""cold as bejesus"" to Entertainment Weekly. ""You know how damp it gets in London. And at night the temperature drops horribly, and that little breeze gets up. You have to wear tons of stuff,"" he said. Plummer said that Ledger had a ""terrible, lingering bug in London, and he couldn't sleep at all. We all -- I thought he'd probably got walking pneumonia,"" he told EW. Gilliam has had challenges before. During the making of his film ""The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"" the Monty Python troupe member coped with filming near a NATO shooting range, a flash flood and a star with a herniated disc, a final indignity that prompted financiers to pull the plug. But nothing approaches Ledger's death. Indeed, part of the reason Gilliam was able to obtain the film's relatively paltry $30 million financing was because of Ledger's agreement to star, according to Variety. Ledger and Gilliam had become close during the making of Gilliam's ""The Brothers Grimm"" and Ledger had plans to become a feature director himself, several sources have reported. The actor had directed a handful of music videos, including one for Ben Harper, with whom he formed a record company. Last month, Gilliam told Variety, ""He's going to be a much better director than I will ever be."" Plummer told EW that ""Parnassus"" had ""an enormous amount left to do."" After a short break, the cast was going to re-convene in Vancouver, British Columbia, primarily for technical and special-effects work. ""God knows what's going to happen now,"" Plummer said.

"(CNN) -- Imagine that you wake up tomorrow morning and discover that during the night. Israeli planes had conducted a bombing raid on Iran. How would your world have changed? Apart from the sensational headlines and breathless reports, the initial change might not be very significant. You would probably want to know whether the United States approved or assisted in the attack on Iran's nuclear sites. In fact, it doesn't really matter. Just about everyone in the world will assume that the U.S. was complicit, regardless of what Washington says. Let's assume that Israel notified the Obama administration about the same time the planes were taking off, if only to ensure that U.S. aircraft and missiles in the Persian Gulf region would not interfere with the bombers and refueling aircraft as they passed over one or more Arab countries. But for Iran and just about everyone else, the fact that most of the Israeli aircraft and bombs were made in the U.S. would be all they needed to know. On that first morning, the U.N. Security Council would convene in emergency session to consider a resolution denouncing the Israeli raid. If the United States vetoed the resolution, that would remove any lingering doubt of U.S. complicity. Perhaps more significant, however, would be European support of the resolution. This would signal the beginning of the collapse of the sanctions coalition against Iran that had been so laboriously assembled over the past several years. Both the Europeans and the Americans had operated on the tacit belief that crippling sanctions were an alternative to war. With the outbreak of war, that assumption would no longer be valid. What would Iran do? Everyone would be poised for a massive military response. They might be surprised. Iran would almost certainly give the required 90 days notice of its intention to quit the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and terminate inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iranian officials would not necessarily announce that they intended to proceed with development of a nuclear weapon, but they would certainly make clear that as a nonnuclear state that had been attacked by another state with nuclear weapons, that was a decision that was entirely up to them. All enriched uranium stocks would be removed from IAEA seal, and all monitoring cameras would be removed. A different twist would be introduced if Iran had succeeded in shooting down one or more of the Israeli planes. One or more Israeli pilots in Iranian hands would sharply increase the risk of further escalation by either the United States or Israel. Of more general significance, the markets would realize that some two million barrels a day of Iranian oil were now removed from the world market for an indeterminate period of time, and the price of oil would jump. The head of the IMF has suggested that an immediate increase of 20% to 30% could be expected. But that could be just the beginning. It is not hard to imagine that, in the days following the attack, there would suddenly be unexplained pipeline explosions in Iraq, possibly by pro-Iranian militias, which might remove another million barrels per day from the market. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipelineÂ from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean might also be attacked. Moreover, one might expect disruptions in oil delivery and loading in Arab ports up and down the Gulf, some because of sabotage but others from cyberattacks on the control systems. Iran would attribute these to ""the hand of God,"" but the more pragmatic effect would be a very substantial portion of the world's oil suddenly removed from world supply. If sustained over more than a few weeks, the scramble to replace large volumes of Persian Gulf and Caspian oil would drive up the price of oil, and gasoline, to unprecedented heights. That would constitute a huge tax on the world's economies, just at the moment when they were showing signs of recovery from the Great Recession. Extremely vulnerable economies, such as the southern European states, could be tipped into bankruptcy, but all states would face significant challenges as a surge in transportation and manufacturing costs rippled through all aspects of their industries. This is Iran's true weapon of mass destruction. Regardless of whether Iran should choose to retaliate openly against U.S. forces or Israel, it would be extremely difficult for the United States to avoid entering into a third Middle East war. Most of the top security officials in the Pentagon have warned against such a war, so the internal opposition in the administration is likely to be great. The combination of widespread opposition to Iran, however, and the appeal of self-defense would be difficult to resist, particularly in an election year. Most experts agree that the Iranian nuclear program cannot be eliminated ultimately without an actual military presence on the ground and forcible regime change. The American public, showing real signs of war weariness after two ground wars over more than a decade, is unlikely to be enthusiastic about a military confrontation with Iran that is likely to be far more costly and indeterminate than either Iraq or Afghanistan. That could prompt a public debate about the extent of U.S. and Israeli common interests. The danger of such an outcome was hinted by Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak when he suggested to the Knesset that ""Israel should increase its sensitivity, awareness and attentiveness to requirements based on the reality in the United States and adopt a policy that strengthens the special relationship between the two countries."" The biggest threat, however, would not be the first day or even the first week after an Israeli attack. The greatest threat might well be the first year or more after an attack, particularly if a major economic crisis was accompanied by growing evidence that Iran had proceeded underground and out of sight of the international community to produce a nuclear weapon. That would make our present situation, before any attack, look wonderfully attractive by comparison. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gary Sick.","Gary Sick: If Israel bombed Iran nuclear sites, most of the world would believe U.S. was involved .
Sick: Europe would support a U.N. resolution condemning it and likely end Iran sanctions .
Iran would be justified in having nukes, he says; U.S. would likely enter another Mideast war .

"Burlington, Vermont (Travel + Leisure) -- On a recent afternoon along Church Street in Burlington, Vermont, young aspiring actors recited passages from Shakespeare's Henry V as jugglers, break-dancers, and blowers of didgeridoos displayed their skills nearby, creating a visual and aural cacophony. Just another day in a thriving college town -- this one happening to be home to the University of Vermont. There are notable distinctions between college towns and other American cities. In the student-centric spots, bicycles seem to outnumber cars. Affordable restaurants serve up authentic cuisines from all around the world. The streets are densely packed with businesses, making for a highly pedestrian-friendly environment. Nature is usually accentuated: the shimmering Lake Champlain, backdropped by a sawtooth silhouette of peaks, forms the western edge of Burlington. Madison, Wisconsin, is situated on an isthmus between two lakes that draw hordes of hikers and bikers. Boulder, Colorado, is an outdoor enthusiast's dream. And don't forget the bars. Each of these locales offers plenty of opportunities for imbibing, many of them ideal for both people-watching and soaking in the scenery. It's hard to beat sunset cocktails at Austin's Oasis, where tiered decks jut from a 450-foot-high cliff over Lake Travis. These attractions are mainly geared toward the students, naturally, but they can be readily enjoyed by those with no homework assignments or college connections. After all, few sports experiences can top the rafter-shaking raucousness in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, during a Tar Heels basketball game. Many schools benefit from world-class art collections in glittering facilities designed by marquee architects; Chapel Hill's Ackland Art Museum, featuring a wing by Polshek Partnership, tempts visitors with Warhols, Titians, and Dalís in a way that many university-less cities cannot. The performing arts also abound. Most campuses host an array of dance, theater, and performing arts to rival a season at Lincoln Center. Not to mention rock. This fall, for instance, the Boulder Theater, near the University of Colorado, will host the Psychedelic Furs, Aimee Mann, and Dinosaur Jr. So, as students zip up their backpacks for a return to the classroom, it's a good time for any traveler to pack up a trunk and visit one of these bustling campus locations. Just don't count on peace and quiet if you go to bed early. Oxford, Mississippi (University of Mississippi) On autumn Saturdays when Vaught-Hemingway Stadium is packed with 65,000 whooping fans, it may be tough to associate Oxford with anything but football. But in a place named for a scholarly English city and that is home to William Faulkner's columned retreat, Rowan Oak, paperbacks take precedence over quarterbacks, especially at Square Books. Its tens of thousands of volumes include autographed copies of works by southern authors like Eudora Welty. When not reading, residents pedal the city's fast-growing network of bike trails. ""I was surprised to learn Mississippi could be so progressive,"" says Kevin Stuart of Oxford Bicycle Company. Local taste: Act the southern gentleman on the upstairs porch at City Grocery by ordering a ""Just North of South"" bourbon mojito. Olympia, Washington (Evergreen State College) State capitals and colleges fit together seamlessly in a number of locales (see Austin and Madison). Olympia nicely mixes buttoned-up government workers and dreadlocked students. It's hard to miss the Capitol Campus -- you can see the legislative building's sandstone dome from almost anywhere in the city. Take a guided tour, and then stroll through the lovely conservatory and gardens. Every Earth Day, the Procession of the Species parade, with participants colorfully dressed as birds, turtles, killer whales and more, weaves through downtown -- near where Harlequin Productions draws theatergoers to its unconventional shows at the State Theater. Local taste: Though vegetarians are plentiful in Olympia, shellfish fans are, too; find them slurping Fanny Bays, from the British Columbia bay of the same name, at the Oyster House. Charlottesville, Virginia (University of Virginia) The music scene was fertile here B.D.M.B -- that is, before the Dave Matthews Band, which formed in Charlottesville in the early 1990s. These days, alternative rock, country, and reggae acts -- as well as, of course, jam bands -- get crowds moving at the Charlottesville Pavilion, the Paramount Theater, and even Scott Stadium, where U2 arrives in October. But the best performances may lurk along the brick sidewalks of the postcard-perfect downtown, in tiny venues like Miller's, a former drugstore that's now known for jazz and blues. When the music's over, be sure to get a good look at the Thomas Jefferson -- planned campus and explore a Blue Ridge Mountain trail. Local taste: Matthews, who was born in Johannesburg, might enjoy the ""boerie burgers"" at the Shebeen, a South African restaurant. Austin, Texas (University of Texas) Texas's retro-stylish capital prides itself on turning out offbeat characters -- Willie Nelson and Matthew McConaughey, for starters. But for something truly batty, check out the Ann Richards/Congress Avenue Bridge, where 1.5 million Mexican free-tailed bats hang out -- quite literally. At dusk, from March through October, they flap off to chase insects. Viewed from a lawn below next to Lady Bird Lake, the swarm will blot out the sunset. Austin, the so-called live music capital of the world, turns into a music fanatic's dream each March during the SXSW festival. Local taste: Go for some Texas barbecue at the low-key Artz Rib House, where for $16.99 you can get messy with a full rack of baby-back ribs. Sip alfresco drinks and take in the sunset at Oasis, where tiered decks jut out from a 450-foot-high cliff over Lake Travis. Burlington, Vermont (University of Vermont) College towns don't get more scenic than Burlington, where a 7.5-mile bike path on old railroad beds provides wind-riffled views of Lake Champlain. It's understandable, then, that outdoor activities figure prominently here. Rent a kayak from Umiak to explore bays fringed with pines, or hike Burrow's Trail to the summit of nearby Camel's Hump, whose bald-faced 4,083-foot summit offers living-map panoramas. Local taste: Dine on local delicacies at the Green Room, which offers locavore favorites like Vermont lamb braised with green peppercorns. Boulder, Colorado (University of Colorado) In a town that always pops up on ""healthiest cities in America"" lists, bike trails are abundant and outdoor options are endless. The Wild West begins along Baseline Road in Boulder, in the foothills of the Rockies known as the Flatirons, for their sharply angled faces. Rent climbing shoes from Neptune Mountaineering, whose in-store museum features dozens of ice axes and an early pair of Rossignol skis. Local taste: The Chautauqua National Historic Landmark, built in the 1800s as a Methodist retreat, now serves up salmon with salsa verde on a wraparound porch. The on-site summer-camp-type cottages provide eagle-eye views toward the flatlands. Berkeley, California (University of California) If coffee shops define a good college town, Berkeley has the competition beat. Some host bands, others show art, many sell fair-trade blends, and most offer a space where it's okay to relax for hours. ""It's kind of a universal hangout place, not just for professors and students,"" says Erik Hvezda, a barista at Brewed Awakening. Many residents prefer the crackle of vinyl to MP3s; pick up some LPs at the well-stocked Amoeba Music on Telegraph Avenue, Berkeley's festive commercial strip. In the heart of campus, the 61-bell carillon provides the tunes atop 307-foot Sather Tower, which also offers stunning panoramas of San Francisco Bay. Local taste: For brunch, fit in with the crunchy crowd by ordering a tofu scramble at Venus. For some local suds, stop in for pints at the festive Pyramid Brewery. Ann Arbor, Michigan (University of Michigan) If a town's name references trees, it's a good bet nature will figure prominently. At the lush, 123-acre Nichols Arboretum, gravel paths wind past blazes of yellow, pink, and white peonies and the occasional reclining student. The ""Arb"" is also frequently the setting for Shakespeare stagings. Slake your thirst amid more flora at Dominick's, whose garden is ideal for enjoying any of the 10 local microbrews on tap. Local taste: Apart from the various Wolverines sports teams, the pride of Ann Arbor is Zingerman's Roadhouse, where the rooftop vintage neon sign reads ""Really Good American Food."" And that's what you'll get, of every type, from New Mexican chiles to oysters from Apalachicola, FL. Madison, Wisconsin (University of Wisconsin) Like oases in deserts, college towns in the Midwest can be refreshing splashes of hustle and bustle amid the plains. The Wisconsin capital squeezes cafés, art galleries, and the César Pelli -- designed Madison Museum of Contemporary Art onto an invigorating pedestrian-only thoroughfare. In warm weather, the museum's roof is the setting for concerts and films. Elsewhere are found lively neighborhood block parties, like the Atwood Summerfest, which annually offers rock bands on multiple stages. And there's no shortage of aquatic fun: the city is located on an isthmus between a pair of glittering lakes. Local taste: L'Etoile Restaurant is the region's slow-food mecca. Chapel Hill, North Carolina (University of North Carolina) Yes, there's a fine clutch of Georgian classroom buildings around a shaded, picturesque quad, but during the winter months, everyone's attention is fixated on the Dean Dome, home to the powerhouse Tar Heels basketball team. Come November, tickets that haven't been snapped up by students are available to the public. Die-hards check out the 8,000-square-foot, year-old Carolina Basketball Museum, which doubles as a de facto shrine to alum Michael Jordan (old jerseys included). Still, nothing beats game time, says ticket director John Miller: ""It's really just electric."" During the off-season, browse for art at Red Window, owned by Elizabeth Edwards, wife of former senator John Edwards. Local taste: Though the building's a flyspeck, the long lines of cars at the drive-through window of the Sunrise Biscuit Kitchen testify to the restaurant's celebrated sweet tea and fried chicken.

"(CNN) -- Tuesday's Virginia earthquake triggered the shutdown of a nearby nuclear power plant and spurred declarations of ""unusual events"" at plants as far away as Michigan, U.S. authorities reported. Dominion Virginia Power said both reactors at its North Anna plant, less than 20 miles from the epicenter of the magnitude-5.8 quake, shut down automatically after the first tremors. Amanda Reidelbach, an emergency management spokeswoman for Louisa County, said the plant vented steam, but there was no release of radioactive material. David Heacock, the utility's chief nuclear officer, said the 1,800-megawatt plant was operating on emergency power and the two pressurized-water reactors were safely deactivated. ""The plants are designed for this kind of a seismic event,"" Heacock said. ""There is no apparent damage to anything at the plant right now."" Crews were working to restore off-site power to the plant Tuesday evening, the utility said. Dan Stoddard, senior vice president of nuclear operations for Dominion, said some power from the grid had been restored to the reactors and it was possible full power could be achieved late Tuesday. It was not clear if a 4.2-magnitude aftershock Tuesday evening would affect the operation. Stoddard said there was no damage to the spent fuel pool. The diesel generators supplying backup power have enough fuel to operate 30 days and more can be brought in, if needed, Stoddard told CNN . ""The power plant is safe,"" Stoddard said. One of those generators failed a few minutes after it kicked in, said Joey Ledford, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's regional office in Atlanta. But only one generator is required to supply power to each reactor unit, leaving another unit in reserve, Ledford said. ""They're in good shape at this point,"" he said. Stoddard said even with the failure of one generator, Dominion has four others in use or available. The North Anna plant is about 50 miles northwest of Richmond and about 90 miles southwest of Washington. Operators declared an alert -- the second-lowest level of emergency reporting under U.S. nuclear regulations -- after the quake struck shortly before 2 p.m., the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said. NRC inspectors went over the North Anna plant as part of a review of U.S. nuclear facilities after the disaster at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi, where three reactors melted down following the massive earthquake and tsunami that struck the plant March 11. They found that diesel generators needed to provide emergency power were functional and ""readily available for short-term actions,"" and the utility moved quickly to replace one portable generator that was not working at the time, according to the NRC's inspection report. At Fukushima Daiichi, the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl, cooling systems and backup generators were knocked out by the 15-meter (48-foot) tsunami that swamped the plant shortly after the magnitude-9 earthquake. Dominion Virginia said reactors at its other nuclear station, the Surry plant near Newport News, were still running. Surry and 11 plants in five other states issued an ""unusual event"" declaration, the lowest level of emergency notice, according to the NRC. They are the Shearon Harris plant in North Carolina; the Calvert Cliffs plant in Maryland; Pennsylvania's Susquehanna, Three Mile Island, Limerick and Peach Bottom plants; the Oyster Creek, Hope Creek and Salem plants in New Jersey; and the D.C. Cook and Palisades plants in Michigan. ""All these plants continue to operate while plant personnel examine their sites,"" the NRC said. CNN's Emily Smith, Brian Todd, Jeanne Meserve, Scott Bronstein, Shawn Nottingham and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: Some electricity restored to nuclear power plant .

"(CNN) -- The evidence that people are getting tired of 3-D continues to pile up. The latest bad news comes from Nintendo president Satoru Iwata, who in an interview with The Independent admitted that interest in 3-D is ""perhaps slightly on the wane again."" Although Nintendo will continue to offer 3-D in its handheld gaming devices, it won't be a major selling point, says Iwata: . ""So, now we've created the 3DS and 3DS XL and also have some games out there that are really using that 3-D effect that we can see, from my point of view, that it's an important element. But as human beings are this kind of surprise effect wears off quickly, and just [having] this 3-D stereoscopic effect isn't going to keep people excited."" Iwata's view that 3-D is ""slightly on the wane"" seems like an understatement. You needn't look far for other signs that 3-D is failing. Consider the box office. Although studios released 19 more 3-D movies in 2011 than the year before, 3-D box office revenue fell by 18% in the U.S., or about $400 million, according to the Motion Picture Association of America. Last month, 3-D attendance hit a record low for the opening weekend of Pixar's ""Brave,"" with just 32% of revenues coming from 3-D, says the Hollywood Reporter. While ""The Avengers"" fared better, with a little more than half of sales coming from 3-D tickets, it's not even close to the 83% 3-D revenue that ""Avatar"" enjoyed in December 2009. The days where you absolutely had to see a hit movie in 3-D are over. The 3-D TV situation isn't much better. Sales of 3-D televisions are on the rise in the U.S. according to The NPD Group, but only 14% of consumers who might buy a TV in the next six months say 3-D is a ""must-have"" feature. Most people just think of it as future-proofing â€” something that might be nice to have. Even Samsung, the world's largest TV maker, admits that 3-D TV hasn't lived up to the hype, and the company is now exalting web-connected smart TVs as its next big source of growth. It's easy to guess why 3-D is struggling in movies and television sets: People don't want to be burdened with 3-D glasses, or worry about eye strain, and pay a premium for the privilege. But Nintendo's cooling attitude toward glasses-free 3-D signals a deeper problem: Even once you remove the pesky glasses, the novelty of 3-D wears off. That's a pretty staggering admission from a company that put the term ""3D"" in the name of its handheld. At least with 3-D hype deflated, media and tech companies can focus on more important things. Samsung can put more effort into smart TV. Nintendo can work on adding more features and new entertainment apps to the 3DS. I know this is a stretch, but maybe Hollywood can stop putting out so many bad movies. Those all seem like better alternatives than fooling your eyes into seeing another dimension.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Democratic presidential front-runner Sen. Hillary Clinton is being taken to task by her two closest rivals for accepting $400,000 in campaign contributions from Washington lobbyists. Sen. Hillary Clinton dismissed criticism that she took money from lobbyists, saying it would not influence her. Over the weekend, Clinton was booed by an audience of liberal bloggers in Chicago when she defended taking money from Washington lobbyists, something both Sen. Barack Obama and former Sen. John Edwards have vowed not to do. ""I don't think, based on my 35 years fighting for what I believe in, anybody seriously believes I'm going to be influenced by a lobbyist or a particular interest group,"" Clinton said. ""A lot of these lobbyists, whether you like it or not, represent real Americans. They actually do. They represent nurses, they represent social workers -- yes, they represent corporations that employ a lot of people."" The former first lady said that she welcomed the debate on the issue. ""I've been waiting for this. This gives us a real sense of reality with my being here,"" Clinton said, prompting a loud rumble from the audience at a candidates' forum sponsored by The Daily Kos. Edwards' response was to ask, ""How many people in this room have a Washington lobbyist working for you?"" ""You are not represented by Washington lobbyists. We need to cut these people off,"" he said, to cheers. However, while eschewing contributions from Washington lobbyists, Edwards has accepted about $10,000 in contributions from lobbyists in his home state of North Carolina, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The Edwards campaign said there is no inconsistency because his pledge did not extend to lobbyists representing local interests. Monday, the Edwards campaign also said it would return a $4,600 donation from the Credit Suisse bank, which is registered to lobby in Washington. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, lobbyists actually provide less campaign cash than political action committees or donors directly affiliated with large corporate interests. ""But they do get a lot of attention because it's very easy to point at them and say, well, these are the special interests, these are the people who most represent these big moneyed interests that are trying to influence policy,"" said Massie Ritsch, a spokesman for the center. And while the grassroots interests of many ordinary Americans are represented by Washington lobbyists, as Clinton noted, some political experts think that could be a hard case for her make. Stu Rothenberg of the Rothenberg Political Report said that while Clinton is making an ""analytical argument"" about the way the political system works, Edwards ""is simply getting the emotional advantage of portraying her as somebody who is close to lobbyists and big business and the establishment.""

"(CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Monday took away some of the government's power to tighten emission standards, but preserved the majority of its authority under federal law to regulate greenhouse gases. In a 5-4 decision, the justices affirmed conclusions by much of the scientific community that greenhouse gases blamed for global warming are pollutants. Although it concluded that the Environmental Protection Agency could not completely extend its regulatory authority for limiting the expansion or building of new facilities like power plants. The ruling, on a case seen as a major test of executive authority, gave both sides of the politically charged debate some reason to celebrate. But it also may have the longer term effect of extending legal fights for years. Many conservative groups have characterized President Barack Obama as misusing his power and ignoring the will of Congress. Industry has complained that the administration has used its power to include the development of power plants and other stationary infrastructure. Businesses worry any unchecked expansion of rules could someday apply to millions of other small carbon emitters -- schools, small businesses, and shopping malls. The court agreed to some extent. Justice Antonin Scalia said the ""EPA's rewriting of the statute was impermissible."" But the court majority said the administration was not being hampered too greatly in the end, since EPA can still regulate all but 3 percent of the 86 percent of sources responsible for greenhouse gases. ""EPA is getting almost everything it wanted in this case,"" said Scalia. The agency responded positively to the decision. ""Today is a good day for all supporters of clean air and public health and those concerned with creating a better environment for future generations,"" it said in a statement. The government is now expected to continue pushing for authority over emissions from coal-fired plants. And the court's action will not end what are expected to be further court fights between the administration and industry. Obama earlier this year announced new rules to extend carbon emission standards to larger trucks and buses. The White House said ongoing stalemates on Capitol Hill prompted him to act. Republicans in Congress and their allies have expressed similar concerns over discretionary executive branch changes and delays in implementing Obamacare reforms, a tepid federal response to recent state marijuana legalization, and a refusal to defend a law that did not recognize legally married same-sex couples for federal purposes. The high court last summer struck down that provision in the federal Defense of Marriage Act. The justices in 2007 agreed with EPA and many environmentalists that greenhouse gasses, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions, cause air pollution, but that case dealt with emissions from motor vehicles. Defining ""air pollutant"" within the context of greenhouse gases and the ability of the EPA to exercise its regulatory authority absent what it says was a clear congressional mandate -- was the issue here. ""Today the U.S. Supreme Court delivered a stern rebuke to the President,"" said Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott. ""It is a resounding defeat for those, like the President, who would use unelected bureaucracies to override the will of the people."" Texas and 16 other the states in the South and Midwest were among the parties whose cases were reviewed by the court. A coalition of 15 states backs the White House. Some progressive groups worry the conservative majority Supreme Court has been overly friendly to corporate interests in recent years. This is the second major environmental regulation case that will be heard this term. The justices earlier this year allowed the EPA to measure emissions from an upwind state that is polluting a downwind state, and requiring upwind states to pay for greenhouse gas reductions. Many business groups had hoped the conservative majority would limit the reach of government in this and a range of regulatory areas, which the Chamber of Commerce and others say is hurting the economy and stifling innovation.","Obama administration authority to tighten pollution standards limited .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- A nuclear scientist was killed in a blast in Tehran on Wednesday morning, an Iranian news agency reported, in the latest in a string of attacks that Iran has blamed on Israel. A motorcyclist placed a magnetic bomb under Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan's Peugeot 405, the state-run IRNA news agency said. The blast also wounded two others, IRNA said. State television channel Press TV reported later Wednesday that Roshan's driver, Reza Qashqaei, had died in a hospital from his injuries. Mohammad Khazaee, Iranian ambassador to the United Nations, condemned what he called ""cruel, inhumane and criminal acts of terrorism against the Iranian scientists."" ""Based on the existing evidence collected by the relevant Iranian security authorities, similar to previous incidents, perpetrators used the same terrorist method in assassinating Iranian nuclear scientists, i.e., attaching a sticky magnetic bomb to the car carrying the scientists and detonating it,"" Khazaee said in a statement. ""I would like to emphasize, once again, that the Islamic Republic (of) Iran would not compromise over its inalienable right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and any kind of political and economic pressures or terrorist attacks targeting the Iranian nuclear scientists, could not prevent our nation in exercising this right,"" Khazaee said. Lawmaker Kazem Jalali blamed the intelligence agencies of the United States and Israel for the latest attack, saying the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, also bore responsibility for passing on information about Iran's nuclear scientists to other countries, IRNA reports. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, speaking alongside the Qatari foreign minister in Washington, rejected the claims. ""I want to categorically deny any United States involvement in any kind of act of violence inside Iran,"" she said. ""We believe there has to be an understanding between Iran, its neighbors and the international community that finds a way forward for it to end its provocative behavior, end its search for nuclear weapons and rejoin the international community and be a productive member of it."" Israel does not normally comment on such claims. However, Brig. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said on his Facebook page Wednesday: ""I have no idea who targeted the Iranian scientist but I certainly don't shed a tear."" Roshan, 32, was a deputy director for commercial affairs at the Natanz uranium enrichment facility in Isfahan province and a graduate of Iran's Oil Industry University, according to the semi-official news agency Fars. Natanz, which is said to have 8,000 centrifuges in operation, is one of two facilities that is enriching uranium in the country. This week, the IAEA identified the second in the mountains of Qom province. Western diplomats at the U.N. on Wednesday criticized Iran over the recent revelation that Tehran is enriching uranium beyond the level needed for civilian use, saying that the actions flaunt Security Council resolutions. The Security Council discussed the issue in closed consultations. ""We have very serious concerns about this blatant disregard for fulfillment of their international obligations,"" said Rosemary DiCarlo, deputy U.S. ambassador to the U.N. ""The location, the size and the clandestine nature of the facility at Qom raise serious doubts about what its ultimate purposes are,"" added Philip Parham, deputy British ambassador to the U.N. The IAEA announced on Monday its finding that Iran is enriching uranium at a previously secret facility to 20% purity. Diplomats said that further Security Council sanctions were possible. But they indicated that they are focusing on ensuring that the sanctions already in place are enforced. They emphasized the need for a negotiated solution to the standoff. ""A year ago we passed very strict sanctions on Iran, the most comprehensive ever,"" DiCarlo said. ""Those sanctions are being implemented, and President Ahmadinejad himself has acknowledged to his own parliament that they're having an impact."" Officials in the United States and other Western nations have ratcheted up sanctions against Tehran since a November report by the IAEA said the Iranian government was developing the technology needed to build a nuclear weapon. Last month, U.S. President Barack Obama announced sanctions against Iran's central bank. Tehran maintains its nuclear program is for civilian energy purposes only. But the IAEA has said it cannot verify whether the intent of Tehran's nuclear program remains peaceful. The attack comes at a time when relations between Iran and the United States have rarely been as strained. Iran sentenced Iranian-American and former Marine Amir Hekmati to death Tuesday for alleged espionage, prompting strong condemnation from the U.S. State Department. Iran also aggravated tensions in the past month with its threat to close the strategically important Strait of Hormuz if Western nations carry through with sanctions on its oil industry to punish Tehran's lack of cooperation on its nuclear program. In comments Wednesday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov urged Western nations and Iran to avoid escalating the situation further, Russia's official Itar-Tass news agency reported. Responding to Wednesday's bombing, Iran's First Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi said the attacks against scientists would not stop the country from achieving its goals, IRNA reported. ""Iranian scientists become more determined to take steps in line with the aspirations of the Islamic Republic in spite of terrorist operations,"" Rahimi told the news agency. The attack followed a similar mode of operation as others that have killed nuclear scientists in Iran's capital city. And on January 12, 2010, Iranian university professor and nuclear scientist Massoud Ali Mohammadi died in a blast when an assailant stuck a bomb under his car. Majid Jamali Fashi, an Iranian, reportedly confessed to the bombing and was sentenced to death in August, IRNA reported at the time. Prosecutors accused him of working for Israel's spy agency Mossad and said he was paid $120,000 by Israel to carry out the hit, Fars news agency reported. Israel does not comment on such claims. In November 2010, nuclear scientist Majid Shahriari was killed in a blast where, again, a bomb was stuck under a car by someone on a motorcycle. Another nuclear scientist, Prof. Fereydoun Abbasi Davani, and his wife were injured in a similar attack. Abbasi is now director of the Iran Atomic Energy Organization. ""The bomb used in the (Wednesday) explosion was a magnetic bomb, the same kind that were used in previous assassinations of Iranian scientists. And the fact is that this is the work of the Zionists,"" Fars news agency quoted Tehran's Deputy Gov. Safarali Baratloo as saying. Iran uses the term ""Zionist"" to refer to Israel. Iran has been engaged in a war of words with Israel, whom it accuses of trying to destabilize the republic. Mickey Segal, a former director of the Iranian department in the IDF Intelligence Branch, told Israel Army Radio that Wednesday's attack was part of broader pressure being brought to bear on President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's regime. ""Many bad things have been happening to Iran in the recent period. Iran is in a situation where pressure on it is mounting, and the latest assassination joins the pressure that the Iranian regime is facing,"" Segal said. The Jerusalem Post reported Wednesday that the Israeli military chief of staff Benny Gantz, speaking at a Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee meeting, warned that ""2012 will be a critical year in the connection between Iran gaining nuclear power, changes in leadership, continuing pressure from the international community and events that happen unnaturally."" Ali Ansari, a professor at the Institute for Iranian Studies at Scotland's University of St. Andrews, said more information is needed about the victims to help determine who's perpetrating the attacks. Some have speculated that the victims were members of the opposition movement and could have been targeted by internal forces, Ansari said. ""But if it is true that Israel is behind it, Iran should make a formal complaint to the U.N. so they can get an answer from Israel,"" Ansari said. ""Because if they really think some other country is killing their nuclear experts, why are they not giving them more protection?"" CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr, Kevin Flower, Elise Labott, Jill Dougherty, Lateef Mungin, Mick Krever and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: Magnetic bombs were used in other Iran assassinations, ambassador says .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- In China, a sex scandal is often more than just a sex scandal -- because it often involves public money. So jilted mistresses have stepped forward as graft-busters in China's crackdown on corruption. Consider the fate of Liu Tienan. The party official lost his job earlier this year after a former mistress revealed he had embezzled $200 million from banks. ""They have become the most effective way in combating corruption,"" says social commentator and author Lijia Zhang. ""And when these mistresses become the most effective way, that means the government crackdown hasn't been very effective."" China's anti-corruption drive has targeted so-called ""tigers and flies"" -- the powerful leaders and lowly officials who are defrauding the nation. Party at stake . With the very legitimacy of the Communist Party at stake, the fight against graft has been a main focus of Chinese President Xi Jinping, with his anti-corruption tsar Wang Qishan at his side. But how effective has it been? Putting aside the widely publicized fall of Bo Xilai, which is viewed by many as the result of an internal power struggle, the Party has yet to make a significant number of high-level corruption take-downs. ""Xi Jinping has only caught one tiger, a very powerful former head of the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC),"" says political analyst and scholar Willy Lam, referring to Jiang Jiemin, the former CNPC chief, who also held massive control over China's state-owned firms. China-watchers are keeping a close eye on a far bigger beast -- China's high-ranking ex-security chief, Zhou Yongkang. ""At least half of the vice-ministerial and ministerial levels who Xi Jinping has brought to justice have close connections to Zhou Yongkang,"" Lam tells me. ""This is an important litmus test as to whether Wang Qishan and Xi Jinping are willing to break certain conventions. ""Because there is one well-known convention within the Communist Party ... former and current officials of the Politburo Standing Committee are untouchable."" No rule of law . They are untouchable due to the lack of checks and balances in China. ""It's like if a person is ill, he takes his own pulse, prescribes his own medicine, he takes an X-ray on himself and then -- if need be -- he will operate on himself,"" says Reuters' Beijing-based correspondent Benjamin Lim. ""That's not possible, but that's what is happening in China."" China's political elite is also untouchable thanks to China's lack of rule of law. ""There is no rule of law, so people who have good 'guanxi,' people who have good connections with the co-called 'red aristocracy' -- or top officials -- can grease the palms of the officials to get things done and jump the queue,"" says Lam. Without the rule of law or a powerful independent organization against corruption, prospects for reform in China are dim. ""There will not be meaningful real reform,"" says Zhang. ""Because general reform will require a leader who will have courage and will hurt the interests of his family and friends."" ""Xi Jinping has to become strong in order to reform,"" adds Lim. ""But of course if he becomes strong, he may not reform."" Easy targets . Meanwhile, the Party fixes its focus on lower, easy-to-reach targets -- going after petty officialdom with an austerity drive targeting luxury spending. ""At the end of the day, Xi Jinping's policy of restricting conspicuous consumption, putting an end to banquets and six star hotels, is popular,"" says Lam. ""Nonetheless, regarding big-time corruption that means the passing of the envelope and greasing the palm through a billion-yuan kickback -- all of this continues to go on."" China's war on corruption is merely the swatting of flies.","Jilted mistresses have become key weapon in exposing graft .

"(CNN) -- Spanish police announced Friday the arrest of one of the most sought-after narcotraffickers in the world, Edgar Guillermo Vallejo Guarin, also known as ""Beto the Gypsy."" Edgar Guillermo Vallejo Guarin on his wanted posters. Vallejo Guarin was arrested outside a luxury hotel in central Madrid with the collaboration of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the Spanish Civil Guard said in a news release. Vallejo Guarin has a long history of violence, involvement in money laundering of drug funds and corruption of high-level government officials, the release said. Among the nations seeking him was the United States, which had offered a $5 million reward to anyone who helped bring about his capture. He was also on the U.S. State Department's Most Wanted list. In June 2001, he was accused in Florida of being a principal source of cocaine smuggled from Colombia into the United States throughout the 1990s. ""He is responsible for the shipment of a multitude of tons of cocaine via ship to the United States (especially the west coast of Florida and Miami) and Europe,"" the release said. In addition, he is suspected of being linked to various assassinations, it said. It said that, when he was arrested near the hotel, Vallejo Guarin was carrying false identification documentation that identified him as Jairo Gomez. Vallejo Guarin's permanent residence was in a suburb of Barcelona, but he had been moving among a number of hotels in Europe and Venezuela in an apparent attempt to avoid arrest, the release said.","Drug trafficker on U.S. State Department most wanted list is arrested in Spain .

"(CNN) -- Bill Gates is putting out a call to inventors, but he's not looking for software, or the latest high-tech gadget. This time he's in search of a better condom. On its Grand Challenges website, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is offering a $100,000 startup grant to the person who designs ""the next generation condom that significantly preserves or enhances pleasure"" and promotes ""regular use."" It may sound like the setup for a joke, but the goal is deadly serious. While researchers call condoms one of the best ways to stop the spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, getting people to use them is another story. The foundation wants to see something that will lead men and women outside of a committed relationship to stop and think twice before having unprotected sex. The startup grant could lead to $1 million in further funding. ""Male condoms are cheap, easy to manufacture, easy to distribute, and available globally, including in resource-poor settings, through numerous well-developed distribution channels,"" the foundation says. Nevertheless, many people are reluctant to use them because they complain that prophylactics interfere with pleasure and intimacy. This creates ""a trade-off that many men find unacceptable,"" the foundation notes. Contraception, by the numbers . In some places and cultures, condom use is often seen as a sign that a man has AIDS, and many women won't sleep with such men. Female condoms are even more difficult to use and women are often afraid to suggest using them. ""Any advance or new design that gets people to use condoms would be a big plus,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and one of the world's leading AIDS researchers, said in an interview with CNN. He says great strides have been made in treating HIV infection in Africa, but for every person who is treated two more become newly infected. The numbers are indeed startling: 34 million people in the world are living with HIV, according the 2012 UNAIDS World AIDS Day Report. About half of them don't know they're infected, according to Fauci. That problem exists in the U.S. as well, particularly in minority communities. ""Although African-Americans comprise 12% of the population, they account for 45% of all new HIV infections nationwide and 65% of all new infections among women,"" Fauci said previously. ""A substantial portion of newly infected African-Americans are bisexual and homosexual men."" The Gates Foundation hopes that ""new concept designs with new materials can be prototyped and tested quickly."" ""Large-scale human clinical trials are not required,"" it adds. ""Manufacturing capacity, marketing, and distribution channels are already in place."" But building a better condom may not be as easy as it seems. Some sources say the first recorded use of a condom-like sheath was in Egypt in 1350 B.C., and people have been complaining about it -- and trying to improve on it -- ever since.

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Four Japanese nationals have been arrested in China, and are being investigated for entering a military zone without authorization and videotaping military targets, Chinese state media said. The arrests come amid the two nations' diplomatic battle over Japan's detainment of a Chinese fishing captain. ""We believe if our employees knew about the area being off-limits, or the regulation that prohibited cameras in the location, they would not have taken such action,"" the company's executive director said at a news conference Friday in Tokyo. The four Japanese nationals were sent to China for a Japanese government project to reclaim World War II chemical weapons left by Japan's Imperial Army, their company said Friday. A Chinese national also is missing and presumed arrested with his Japanese co-workers on Wednesday in in northern Hebei Province. They work for Fujita Corp., a mid-size Japanese construction company that Goldman Sachs Group acquired in April 2009. Fujita last heard from its employees on Tuesday, the company Executive Director Tatsuro Tsuchiya said Friday. The Fujita office in China received a text message from one of the employees that said, ""Help me,"" in Chinese. The company hasn't heard from them since. Fujita's representative in China is on the way to Hebei Province and has reached out to Japan's Foreign Ministry for help, Tsuchiya said. ""If they are really being detained, we hope nothing but their early release,"" he said. ""We have very limited information. We strongly hope this situation is solved quickly,"" he added. Japan's foreign ministry officials said Friday that China had informed them of the arrests, but they had no information about any charges or why the Japanese nationals had been detained. ""Currently, the case is being investigated,"" is all that Chinese security authorities in Shijiazhuang said in a statement, the state-run China Daily reported. But China has had plenty to say about Japan detaining the Chinese fishing captain. Beijing has made escalating diplomatic threats against Tokyo as it has demanded his release. On Friday, Japan said it will release the captain, but did not offer a time frame. The captain was arrested on September 8 off the disputed Diaoyu Islands, in the East China Sea. He has been accused of obstructing Japanese public officers while they performed duties. Japan has already freed the captain's 14 crew members, who have flown back to China, and returned their fishing boat. The captain and his crew were arrested illegally, according to China. Beijing says the Diaoyu Islands and most of the South China Sea belong to China, disputing neighboring countries' claims. In Japan, the islands are known as the Senkaku. The clash over territorial waters and islands -- and the natural resources that go with them -- is a flashpoint in the Asia-Pacific region. In response to the fishing crew's arrests, China has halted talks with Japan about increasing civil flights and expanding aviation rights between the two countries. Officials and nationals on both sides also have canceled trips to each other's nations. China's Foreign Ministry has said that Japan has ""seriously damaged Sino-Japan bilateral relations"" with the fishing crew's arrests. Tokyo has urged Beijing to proceed calmly and cautiously to avoid further deterioration of the situation. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki contributed to this report.","One of the four sent their company a text message that said, ""Help me""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A U.S. commander in Iraq said he believes it's not possible to withdraw troops from his region south and east of Baghdad by year's end as an influential senator called for a day earlier. Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch said his forces would lose the edge they have gained if troops were withdrawn. Army Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch, commander of the Multi-National Division-Center, was asked to comment on Republican Sen. John Warner's recommendation that President Bush start withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq by Christmas. Speaking to Pentagon reporters Friday via teleconference from Iraq, Lynch said, ""Only when the Iraqi security forces come forward and say, 'OK, here I am, I'm trained and equipped, I'm ready, I'm the Iraqi army or I'm the Iraqi police,' can I turn those sanctuaries over, and that's not going to happen between now and Christmas."" Lynch, whose operations cover the central part of Iraq, south of Baghdad, said soldiers have been helped by the ""surge,"" or additional troops, and have made strides against militants. But he said, ""If we were to lose that capability, the enemy would come back.""  Watch Lynch discuss the effect of pulling troops » . ""We would take a giant step backward,"" said Lynch, adding he needs the troops to fight both Shiite and Sunni militants and to confront significant Iranian influence in the region. By next spring or summer, however, such a move might be possible if enough progress is made, he said. Retired Army Brig. Gen. David Grange, a CNN military analyst, agreed with Lynch's assessment. ""Time is necessary for the Iraqi people to gain confidence in U.S. and Iraqi troops throughout their neighborhoods, get the commerce and other quality of life improvements to take hold, enable the weak political structure a chance to improve and exploit the counterinsurgency opportunities that success is providing from this effort,"" Grange said. Warner, an influential Republican and former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on Thursday recommended that Bush announce the beginning of a U.S. withdrawal in mid-September and that those troops should be back in the United States by Christmas. ""In my humble judgment, that would get everyone's attention -- the attention that is not being paid at this time,"" Warner said. He added: ""I really, firmly believe the Iraqi government, under the leadership of Prime Minister [Nuri] al-Maliki, let our troops down."" Warner, a Virginia Republican who was a former Navy secretary, suggested pulling 5,000 troops off the battlefield would send ""a very clear signal"" without endangering the missions being carried out by the rest. In Texas, where Bush is on vacation, National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said the White House appreciated Warner's advice but would wait for the recommendations of Gen. David Petraeus, the U.S. commander in Iraq, and the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad, Ryan Crocker, before making any decisions. Petraeus and Crocker are to report to the White House in September on the progress of the troop surge. Warner opposed Bush's January decision to send nearly 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Iraq. But he has so far also opposed Democratic efforts to force the president to start bringing U.S. troops home. The surge campaign was aimed at buying time for Iraq's government to reach a political solution to the sectarian and insurgent warfare that has wracked the country since the U.S. invasion in 2003. Warner's recommendation came on the same day as the release of the U.S. intelligence community's latest report on Iraq, which found ""measurable but uneven improvements"" in security in recent months. However, it concluded that Iraq's political leaders ""remain unable to govern effectively."" Democrats have tried to wind down the war since taking over Congress in January, but Senate Republicans have used filibuster tactics to stymie those efforts. After Thursday's report, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, called on Republican senators to join Democrats to force Bush to change course -- and a senior Democratic leadership aide urged Warner to add his vote to those efforts. ""Will he [Warner] vote with us on anything? That is still the open and most important question,"" the aide said. ""A recommendation to the president is different than voting for binding legislative language compelling the president to act."" A Senate Republican leadership aide said Friday that Warner's remarks slowed some of the momentum on Iraq that Republicans had gained after Democrats had acknowledged recent military success in Iraq. But unless Warner were to change his vote to side with Democrats, the impact on the debate in Congress is minimal -- Republicans ""aren't in any different place than they yesterday,"" the source said. A Senate Democratic leadership aide had a similar opinion of the impact. ""The real question would be is Warner willing to vote to support a change of course and policy, and as of yesterday he ruled that out,"" the source said. The aide suggested that Warner's recommendation was timed to coincide with the National Intelligence estimate  because it gives the White House a position it might be willing to accept -- that the 5,000-troop cut might be palatable to Bush. Warner and the Armed Services chairman, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, recently returned from a visit to Baghdad with harsh words for the al-Maliki government. Levin said Monday that Iraq's parliament should throw al-Maliki out of office and replace his government. Warner said he would not join that call. ""But in no way do I criticize it,"" he added.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- About 100 people, including students majoring in homeland security and criminal justice, were arrested Tuesday in an undercover drug sting at San Diego State University, officials said. Officials say the evidence seized includes 50 pounds of marijuana, four pounds of cocaine and 350 ecstasy pills. Among those arrested, 75 were students, one of them a criminal justice major charged with possession of guns and cocaine, authorities said. One student allegedly dealing cocaine was a month short of obtaining a master's degree in homeland security at the California school and worked under campus police as a student community service officer. Campus police initiated the investigation about a year ago, after a student's fatal overdose in May 2007, university President Steve Weber said. About five months ago, as the investigation evolved, campus police sought and received help from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. There was a second overdose death in February at a fraternity house. ""If proven guilty, these individuals have preyed on students and have ruined hundreds of lives,"" Weber said. In addition to facing criminal charges, the students have been suspended from school and evicted from campus housing, he said. Twenty-one people who are not students were arrested recently on a variety of drug charges, officials said. Damon Mosler, chief of the narcotics division for the San Diego County District Attorney's Office, was surprised by what he described as the dealers' openness about what they were doing. ""They weren't picky about who they sold to,"" he said, alleging that undercover officers would simply call them and say, "" 'Hey, I heard you deal. Will you sell to me?' ""And they did."" Officials say the evidence seized as part of Operation Sudden Fall includes four pounds of cocaine, 50 pounds of marijuana and 350 ecstasy pills. Authorities also took one shotgun, three semiautomatic pistols and $60,000. In all, authorities confiscated more than $100,000 worth of drugs, Mosler said. Bags of marijuana weighing four or five pounds would sell for $4,000 to $5,000, he said, and a kilogram of cocaine would sell for about $17,000. Before going to Las Vegas for the weekend, fraternity members involved in the sale of drugs sent text messages to their customers saying, ""We're going to close out our inventory"" and inviting them to ""buy the cocaine at discounted prices,"" Mosler said. After the weekend, they sent another text message saying they were back and ready to do business, Mosler said. Search warrants were carried out last week on suspects' houses off campus, and search warrants were served Tuesday at on-campus housing. Mosler described the students as ""mid-level distributors"" who were selling more than a person might buy for personal use. He identified Phi Kappa Psi and Theta Chi as the two fraternities involved. In the latter case, firearms were found in the house, he said. The firearms included semiautomatic 9 mm or .40-caliber handguns and a rifle, Mosler said. He said the students face charges that include possession for sale and sale of cocaine, ecstasy and marijuana. DEA agents infiltrated several student drug distribution cells and made more than 130 drug purchases and seizures, a news release said. Authorities said they infiltrated seven campus fraternities and found that in some, most of the students were aware of drug dealing by fraternity brothers.","NEW: Officials: About 100 arrested at San Diego State University .

"Moore, Oklahoma (CNN) -- Oklahomans will ""rise again"" and will have the nation behind them as they struggle to bounce back from tornadoes that tore through the state last week, officials said Sunday, a day of quiet reflection and prayer. ""As fellow Americans, we're going to be there as shelter from the storm for the people of Moore who have been impacted,"" said President Barack Obama. ""And when we say that we've got your back, I promise you that we keep our word."" The president described himself as a messenger speaking on behalf of the entire nation as he toured storm damage Sunday. He praised local officials, first responders and school principals for their work in the wake of the storms, which killed 24 people, injured more than 375 others and damaged 12,000 residences in and around the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. One block, two tornadoes: Life in the cross hairs . ""This area's known more than its share of heartbreak, but people here pride themselves on the Oklahoma standard ... being able to work through disasters like this and come out stronger on the other side,"" he said. Speaking in front of the wreckage of the destroyed Plaza Towers Elementary School in Moore, Obama called for Americans to donate to help storm relief efforts. ""It's going to take a long time for this community to rebuild, so I want to urge every American to step up,"" he said, suggesting donating via the American Red Cross website. After his public remarks, Obama met with first responders at a Moore fire station. ""We got to talk to him after he saw the damage, and of course, once you see the damage, it's different,"" Moore Police Sgt. Jeremy Lewis told CNN affiliate KOCO. ""No matter how many pictures you look at, you see it in person, it's going to to change even the president, which it did."" Obama vowed to keep helping the area rebuild, long after camera crews and reporters from around the country leave. ""He ... let us know that after all the media and everything is gone, he'll still be sending anything that we need,"" Lewis said, ""and he'll make sure that we get the town built back up."" It's been a weekend of highs and lows for the tornado-ravaged area. With some school buildings still in shambles, students received diplomas at a convention center on Saturday. Funeral homes and churches were busy with services nearly a week after the devastating storm. A public memorial and prayer service was held Sunday evening at the First Baptist Church in Moore, where tissues were laid out in the pews. ""Our spirits have been shaken this week,"" Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin said at the service. ""Our hearts have been broken, but our resolve is strong and we will rise again. In the midst of human tragedy, we've seen the best of Oklahoma come forth."" Fallin held up two items she found in the wreckage of a school -- a note from a student, and a poster with classroom rules, imploring children to always do their very best. She welcomed a teacher and a group of students from Briarwood Elementary. The school was destroyed by the tornado, but everyone survived. Holding flowers, the students sang ""Jesus Loves Me,"" a song some of them were singing as the storm blasted their school. ""I think it was probably the start of healing for the community,"" Debby Goss, a Shawnee, Oklahoma, resident, said about the prayer service. ""I think a lot of people do pull together here, and this was a good time for them to see each other in one place that wasn't a rescue center or a disaster area -- that there was a peaceful place for them to just sit and think about the other people that are here to support them and help."" A tornado bearing down; a mom in labor . Saturday's graduation festivities were infused by reminders of the storm's tragic aftermath. When Southmoore High's Alyson Costilla walked across the stage to get her diploma, about a dozen people in the crowd stood and held up pictures of her mother, who died in a 7-Eleven ravaged by the powerful winds. A balm after the storm . Transforming Moore back into the city it was won't be easy. Its public schools alone suffered $45 million in damage, including the two elementary schools that were leveled. Insurance claims related to Monday's storm will likely top $2 billion, according to Kelly Collins from the Oklahoma Insurance Department. But residents aren't doing it all alone. Honest advice from Joplin to Moore . Besides the presence of Federal Emergency Management Agency representatives and other public officials on the ground, they've had friends, relatives, even strangers come out to help. Last week, Caleb Allison stared out at the mass of debris that covered the yard in front of his destroyed home. ""Who's going to come get it?"" the Westmoore High School Spanish teacher wondered. ""Even our insurance company said, 'you could pay someone to do it, but it might take days before they can come out here,'"" Allison told CNN. But for Allison, what seemed like a mammoth problem was swiftly solved on Sunday with the help of a group of students, parent-teacher association members and fellow teachers from his school and Heritage Trails Elementary, where his wife teaches music.

"(CNN) -- Nigerian-born entrepreneur Kase Lawal is the epitome of the American dream. Arriving to the US a young, idealistic student, Lawal has carved a name for himself in one of the most competitive industries in the world: Oil. Now head of a multi-billion dollar empire, his Houston-based company, CAMAC, is one of the largest black-owned businesses in the U.S., generating over $2 billion dollars a year. Founded nearly 25 years ago, Lawal built CAMAC (which stands for Cameroon-American) from a small agriculture business into a global oil company. But it's taken a lot of hard work, determination and guts to get him to the top. Born and raised in Ibadan, Nigeria in 1954, Lawal became interested in America and its civil rights movement during his teens. After finally persuading his father, a local politician, to send him to university in America, Lawal headed to Georgia and then Houston, where he attended the Texas Southern University. After graduating with a Bachelor of Science in chemical engineering in 1976, Lawal, like many of his classmates, started out as a graduate in the energy industry. First as a chemist for Dresser Industries (now Halliburton) and then as a chemical engineer with Shell Oil Refining Co. During this time he met his wife, Eileen through a mutual friend and had his three children. Now married and settled, it wasn't long before the innovative young Nigerian started to implement his business ideas. In 1986 he established CAMAC, a company trading agricultural commodities such as sugar, tobacco and rice. In the early 90s he made the leap into the energy sector after the Nigerian government started to develop its energy market. With his knowledge of Nigeria and his Houston address, Lawal was ideally positioned to attract major oil companies. In 1991 CAMAC made a deal with the oil giant Conoco, agreeing to jointly operate and share production from any Nigerian discoveries. This turned out to be Lawal's big break. With his political contacts, local market knowledge and now with the backing of a major oil firm, Lawal's Houston-based company became an instant player in the energy industry. As Lawal told CNN: ""That partnership I believe was the cornerstone of the CAMAC that you know today. Subsequently with that credibility and the advantage of partnering with Conoco, we were also able to partner with BP and also with Statoil of Norway and currently we have made a partnership with Eni, the largest Italian company, which is one of the top five oil companies in the world."" Now CAMAC has offices in London, Johannesburg, Lagos and Port Harcourt, Nigeria and is involved in oil exploration, refining and trading. He was awarded the USAfrica Business Person of the Year in 1997 and in 2002 CAMAC was named the largest African-American owned company on the Black Enterprise 100s list.","Born in Ibadan, Nigeria, Lawal moved to America in 1971 .

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is unapologetic about his government's response to opposition protesters during weeks of unrest in the South American country. Think about what the U.S. government would do if a political group laid out a road map for overthrowing President Barack Obama, Maduro said Thursday in an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""What would happen in the United States if a group said they were going to start something in the United States so that President Obama leaves, resigns, to change the constitutional government of the United States?"" Maduro said, according to a CNN translation of his remarks. ""Surely, the state would react, would use all the force that the law gives it to re-establish order and to put those who are against the Constitution where they belong."" Maduro said that a minority group among the opposition is responsible for a ""violent plan."" That group, he said, has put the opposition in a ""dire situation."" The Venezuelan President spoke with Amanpour in an exclusive interview a day after the one-year anniversary of the death of his predecessor, President Hugo Chavez. The interview aired Friday on CNN. Weeks of anti-government protests have rattled Venezuela and drawn sharp responses from Maduro, who has called for peace while describing those opposing him as fascists and extremists. Demonstrators say they have taken to the streets to protest shortages of goods, high inflation and high crime. It's the biggest threat Maduro has faced since his election last year. One opposition leader who encouraged protests, Leopoldo Lopez, is behind bars, facing charges of arson and conspiracy. ""He created a road map to topple the legitimate government,"" Maduro said. ""So now he's in jail and he has to go through justice."" Maduro said he supported Venezuelans' right to protest conditions in the country, which he said were not as bad as was being portrayed. For example, he said, unemployment has dropped from 25% to less than 10% over the past decade and extreme poverty has fallen from about 35% during the 1990s to 6% today. He made no apologies for continuing work on the goals spearheaded during the reign of his predecessor and lifted from the playbook that guided his mentor, former Cuban President Fidel Castro -- health care and education to all and the eradication of extreme poverty. Protesters have accused Maduro's government of violence that has claimed some 20 lives during the protests. Government officials have blamed Lopez and other opposition leaders for fueling the violence and not doing enough to stop it. Maduro said the unrest had not kept him awake at night. ""I sleep like a child,"" he said. ""Luckily, I have peace of mind, total peace of mind, and I have it because I know I've been loyal and I'm filling the legacy of this marvelous giant figure who is President Chavez, and it gives me peace of mind, and I do things with honesty to favor my people."" Maduro said Venezuela has fine relations with the people of the United States. He cited trade union workers, artists, intellectuals and members of social movements as examples. But he acknowledged that relations between Washington and Caracas have been rocky. ""There is sufficient evidence of U.S. agencies, of how you have conspired to put an end to this revolution, to destroy President Chavez,"" he said. Last month, Maduro expelled three U.S. diplomats form Venezuela, accusing them of conspiring against his government. In response, the United States last week expelled three Venezuelan diplomats. But Maduro held out hope for warmer relations. ""We want to have a new type of relation, based on respect, equality among states and the recognition of what we are today,"" he said. He said he was confident that his recent appointment of Maximilian Arvelaez as his new ambassador to Washington, a position that's been vacant since 2008, would result in progress. ""I'm certain that he will be very helpful to establish new levels of relations,"" he said. Washington has appeared far less enthusiastic about closer ties with Venezuela. A State Department spokeswoman said last month that the United States wants to develop ""a more constructive relationship with Venezuela,"" but noted that wouldn't be easy. ""We've said many months ago that could include an exchange of ambassadors,"" the spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, told reporters. ""But Venezuela also needs to show seriousness for us to be able to move forward. And recent actions, including expelling three of our diplomats, continue to make that difficult."" That tense relationship could change, Maduro said. Asked what his message was for the United States, the Venezuelan President didn't hesitate. ""My message is respect, dialogue, overcoming the visions that they have about Venezuela. Precisely, I made a decision to designate a new ambassador for the United States,"" Maduro said. ""Don't go into a dead end in relation to Venezuela and Latin America. Our message to everyone in power in the United States is respect Venezuela, respect Latin America, and let's establish new levels of relations."" CNN's Luis Arce contributed to this report.","NEW: ""I sleep like a baby,"" President Nicolas Maduro says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Seven months in the Los Angeles County jail have taken a physical toll on Conrad Murray, the doctor convicted in Michael Jackson's death, his lawyer told CNN Monday. ""He looked horrible,"" Attorney Valerie Wass said, describing a visit last week with Murray. ""I've never seen him like that. I'm shocked."" Word that Murray is suffering behind bars may be welcomed news to some Jackson fans who were angry that prosecutors charged him with involuntary manslaughter and not the more serious crime of murder. Murray, 59, has been in jail since November when he was found guilty. He must serve two years of his four year sentence in jail, which would put his release in October, 2013. Michael Jackson 'Bad' reissue to feature unreleased Wembley Stadium show . Next Monday will be the third anniversary of Jackson's death, which the Los Angeles County coroner ruled was caused by a fatal combination of the surgical anesthetic propofol and sedatives administered by Murray. ""He told me last Tuesday 'I may not make it out of here alive. This is a very dangerous place. I'm in here dying. The system is intent on killing me,'"" said Wass, who is handling Murray's appeal. The doctor suspects his moldy, fly-infested, 5-by-7-foot cell is making him sick, causing headaches that have plagued him for several weeks, Wass said. When Wass took Murray's complaints to jail officials, they told her his activities are restricted because ""we're afraid somebody's going to pop him,"" she said. It took several days for Murray to see a doctor about his persistent headache last week, Wass said. Murray is ""receiving the appropriate level of care for his medical condition,"" Los Angeles County Sheriff spokeswoman Nicole Nishida said Monday. Murray is serving his sentence in the county jail, which is operated by the sheriff, because of rules imposed to relieve state prison overcrowding. There is little chance he would be transferred there, Wass said. Dr. Murray's medical license suspended . Wass said she believed Murray would better off in a state prison, where he would be able to get exercise and fresh air regularly. He's only seen the sunshine once in the past four weeks, even though prisoners in the high-security ""F Block"" are suppose to be taken to the jail roof each Monday afternoon, she said. Murray told his lawyer even the ""Grim Sleeper"" suspect, who is charged with killing 10 women over a 22-year period, was allowed on the roof last Monday while Murray was not, Wass said. The sheriff""s spokeswoman said he was getting ""standard roof time"" of once a week. ""I feel like a POW,"" Murray told his lawyer, using the acronym for prisoner of war. He gets fresh underwear just once a week, his lawyer complained. Murray's getting the ""normal linen and clothing exchange,"" Nashida said. Still, Murray appears to be getting along well with his jailers, his lawyer, Wass, said. ""I've been respectful to the sheriff's deputies and for the most part they have reciprocated,"" the lawyer quoted Murray telling her. The jail food is disagreeable to Murray, Wass said. He told her he's has ""nothing real to eat"" since being locked up. A breakfast of a ""smelly"" boiled egg, two slices of bread, cereal and milk is delivered at 4:30 a.m. each day, followed by a peanut butter and jelly or bologna sandwich for lunch. Dinner, delivered at 3:30 p.m., is usually is ""a meat product that looks like clotted blood,"" along with green beans, corn and cabbage, she said. Murray passes his time each day helping other inmates improve their vocabulary with a ""word of the day"" game that he designed, she said. Wass, who is working without pay, is still preparing the appeal of Murray's conviction.

"(CNN) -- Carefully maneuvering around a jumble of slippery rocks, Josephat Torner slowly steps inside a cluster of dark caves in northeast Tanzania. Ahead of him, leading the trail with an air of assurance, walks a local witchdoctor. Aided by a couple of artificial lights, the two figures venture deeper into the darkness, running their hands along the cavern's limestone walls for guidance. Bats meandering above their heads, the men enter a vast cave chamber dotted with a handful of rocks. ""What I want to know is,"" Torner breaks the silence,"" have you ever seen anyone pray for something evil down here?"" he asks the witchdoctor. ""So they can get hold of someone? Like an albino?"" An albino himself, Torner has been traveling around Tanzania to debunk the widespread misconceptions about the congenital disorder. Dozens of albinos have been mutilated and slaughtered in the country in recent years, because of rumors being spread that their body parts can bring wealth and good luck. Read this: Witchcraft in Tanzania . To stop the atrocities, Torner thought he needed to confront the group he believed was the source of these rumors: witchdoctors. And that's what brought him to the depths of this cave, face to face with his ""enemy."" ""We call you a spirit because a white person like you is the devil,"" readily admits the witchdoctor. ""You're saying I'm a white demon?"" Torner hits back, ""we are demons?"" The reply: ""Yes, because you're white."" 'In the Shadow of the Sun' This dramatic confrontation is one of the most intense moments captured in a new documentary, called ""In the Shadow of the Sun."" The independent film, shot by director Harry Freeland, chronicles the life story of Torner and his fight for acceptance of albinos in a country where little is known about the genetic disorder. ""My heart always is still looking the recognition of people with albinism in this world,"" says Torner, who's been an advocate for albino rights since 2004. ""Just to recognize that we are here."" Torner and Freeland spent six years creating the film. The director's inspiration to make a documentary on albinism came nearly a decade ago, when he had one of his first encounters with someone with the disorder in Senegal. ""A woman approached me in the street, held out her child and said 'here, take it back, where it comes from,"" remembers Freeland. ""She had a child with albinism and because I'm white, she thought the child belonged to me in some way -- her husband had left her for having a white child and accused her of sleeping with a white man."" Leading man . People with albinism are born with genes that do not make the normal amounts of the pigment called melanin. Those born with the disorder, which affects people from all races, inherited the genes from their parents who may or may not have any of the associated traits. But many people don't understand the effects of the condition and as Freeland discovered, in parts of Africa albinos often suffer social stigma, prejudice and even attacks. Read this: Slave trade ghost town . Keen to make a film documenting the plight of this group of people, Freeland headed to Tanzania, the country reported to have one of the biggest albino populations in the world. There, he came across many amazing stories, but he didn't find his leading man until he met Torner. ""I just heard him speak and instantly, I just knew he was the one to lead the film,"" says Freeland. ""I think so many stories that come out of Africa are negative, and everything about Josephat is positive."" Despite growing up with a disorder that left his skin and hair pale, as well as his strength and eye sight weak, Torner has succeeded in making the best of his situation. Over the years, he's overcome struggles and discrimination to receive an education and get married. A father of two, Torner' has even climbed Africa's tallest mountain, Kilimanjaro, to prove that albinos can achieve greatness. ""It was really very difficult to climb,"" he admits. ""But I was climbing because at that time I had an agenda behind for what is happening to this world,"" he adds. ""We are killed, we are hunted, we are chopped. So I climbed with a special message ... to the African countries: that we are able. But [also] protect us, give us a chance, don't stigmatize, don't isolate, don't hide us to the darkness room -- just open the way."" 'Why are they killing us?' In 2009, the Tanzanian government embarked on a campaign against the killers of albinos, particularly in the Lake Victoria region. Freeland says at the heart of the problem are witch doctors making claims that albino body parts can bring wealth. ""In Tanzania, there's been 72 reported people with albinism killed over the last five years,"" says Freeland, noting that the actual number could be higher. ""And there's been 34 people left mutilated that have survived attacks."" Some of the victims were people Torner used to know. ""I was angry,"" says Torner, recalling the moments following his confrontation with the witchdoctor. ""He answered it to me directly, without even trying to hide anything. So I was angry, of course, because I remember my brothers and sisters whom I lost, because I will not see them forever and while he's there he's continually surviving,"" he adds. ""So, you ask yourself, 'what's the problem? Why are they killing us? Why are they hunting us?'"" Torner realizes he may never get a suitable answer to those questions. Yet, this doesn't stop him from doing all he can to bring attention to his message of creating a more inclusive society. He hopes that his community work and the documentary focusing on his efforts, coupled with the outreach from other organizations and the government, will eventually make Tanzania a place where albinos aren't forced to stay in the shadows. ""It's my dream in my life that people with albinism are respected and given all rights which other human beings are being given,"" he says. ""This is what is in my heart -- when I would see justice to people with albinism; when I would see the lifespan of people with albinism is increasing, this is still a dream to my life.""","In recent years, there's been an increase in the deaths of albinos in Tanzania .

"(CNN) -- It's almost that time: the once-a-decade-moment when the U.S. Bureau of the Census tries to determine the population. Counting more than 300 million residents is a complex and costly operation (an estimated $14 billion), but the results yield the basis for how we apportion Congress, distribute more than $400 billion in federal funds and understand basic changes to the number and geographic distribution of U.S. residents. The largest challenge that the Census Bureau faces is ensuring everyone is counted, regardless of where they live, who they live with and perhaps most controversially, regardless of whether they are authorized to live in the United States. Most households will receive a census form by mail in mid-March to be filled out as of Census Day, April 1. First results of state counts for redistricting purposes must be delivered by December 31. The rest of the results will be released over a period of time that ends in 2013. Filling out a census form is mandatory by law. The 2010 Census  will have 10 basic questions for each household member, but it is viewed as a burdensome task by some because they see the questions as too personal or the process too intrusive. Others distrust what the government will do with the information or fear that it may be used against them. Some are hampered by language barriers. Still others have more than one residence. Every decade, the Census Bureau works hard to make sure everyone is  counted once and only once. And it makes an extra effort to count those who have traditionally been hard to count: racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants and the poor. This coming census -- the largest count of the U.S. population with more immigrants and minorities than ever -- will be complicated further by the economic downturn and foreclosure crisis because many people are ""doubling up"" or otherwise living in temporary quarters. The census questionnaire asks for a count of all people who live and sleep in the household ""most of the time,"" as of April 1, but not those who are living away at college or in the military or those who are living in a nursing home or who are in a jail, prison or detention facility. (They are counted separately from households.) ""Home"" may have changed recently for those whose hardship leaves them little choice but to live with relatives or friends, however temporary that may be. ""Home"" for displaced residents of the Gulf Coast may be miles away from where they lived before the devastation that Hurricanes Katrina and Rita wrought in their communities. ""Home"" for some immigrants is in U.S. communities even though they are not legally residing in the United States. And ""home"" may be in a prison or detention center in a state far away from the inmate's hometown residence. These are the very residents that Census will try hardest to enumerate this spring. Abutting the challenges of where to call home are the public debates surrounding them: . -- Civil rights leaders, recognizing the unique context of the Gulf Coast region, are working hard to ensure an accurate local  Census. At the same time, other regional leaders would like to see displaced Gulf Coast residents counted where they lived before the storms. -- A coalition of African American leaders is lobbying for inmates to be counted in their place of residence before imprisonment. -- A tug-of-war has ensued between Latino leaders on one side who are working to get an accurate count of the population regardless of legal status and those on the other side who are advocating a census boycott by immigrants as a way to put pressure on Congress to move forward with federal immigration reform. -- A recent amendment introduced in the Senate would have delayed the implementation and hiked up the cost of the census, had it passed. In an attempt to exclude the unauthorized population from the official count for congressional apportionment purposes, it would have required questions on citizenship and immigration status for each respondent. That data is not collected to encourage participation in the census. The senators missed the deadline by two years to make a change of that order of magnitude. Given the demands and challenges, it is vital that we bear in mind the importance of achieving an accurate count and the economic, political and policy implications if we fail. Understanding our changing population: State and local data on age, race and ethnicity, household size and composition help communities with projections for school enrollment, housing, transportation and health care. Businesses use census data for decisions about where to locate and for marketing purposes. Information from the census is used to prepare for emergency services, research changes and advocate for various causes. Distributing federal dollars geographically: More than $400 billion a year is at stake, federal funds that go to states and localities to build schools, hospitals, highways and fund programs such as Medicaid. Apportioning Congress: The redistricting and apportionment of congressional seats is contingent on census results. This is the primary purpose of the census as written into the U.S. Constitution. States and localities also use the data to redistrict; therefore it is in every state's interest to be accurately represented based on their residents. One debate that has been resolved: Census 2010 will not use statistical sampling as many Republican leaders have feared. Sampling has been proposed as one way to mitigate the undercount of minority populations, the majority of whom are assumed to vote Democratic. The U.S. Bureau of the Census does use sampling in its annual American Community Survey that collects more detailed data including social, economic, and demographic characteristics. The political and equity arguments will continue to surface as we head into Census 2010. Public officials, advocacy groups, and community organizations will need to work together with census officials to get the most out of what will be a difficult enumeration, but one that sets the stage for the next decade. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Audrey Singer.","As the 2010 Census gets underway, the counting process will be especially difficult .

She says Latino leaders are split over how to deal with the census .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Militants carried out a deadly attack on a government building in eastern Afghanistan and fired rockets near Kabul's main airport Monday as the Taliban began their annual spring offensive. An armed group stormed the provincial Justice Department in the city of Jalalabad on Monday morning, clashing with Afghan security forces, authorities said. By the time the fighting ended, three insurgent gunmen, two police officers and five civilian employees of the Justice Department were dead, said Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry. At least one other civilian was wounded, he said. In the capital, Kabul, two rockets landed near military buildings around the northern side of the city's international airport but didn't cause any casualties or material damage, the Interior Ministry said. Car bomb kills 4, injures 22 in Afghanistan . As they often do, the Taliban offered a different version of events, claiming the rocket attack had killed several people and damaged buildings. In their statement last week announcing the start of their spring military operations, the Taliban said the offensive's main targets would include foreigners, Afghan government staff and their organizations nationwide. Each year since NATO forces entered Afghanistan, the Taliban has launched renewed attacks as the snow melts. Most NATO troops are due to withdraw from Afghanistan by the end of this year as the U.S.-led war effort winds down. CNN's Masoud Popalzai and journalist Qadir Sediqi reported from Kabul. CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.","NEW: Attackers kill seven in Jalalabad fighting .

"(CNN) -- As anti-American furor raged in the home of the Arab Spring, the top U.S. diplomat on Friday sternly warned countries where the unrest has been most pronounced: Stop the violence and seek justice against those attacking diplomatic missions, or else the United States will. From Morocco to Malaysia, thousands of Muslims have taken to the streets in recent days. Many have fumed over what Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described Friday as an ""awful Internet video that we had nothing to do with"" -- an inflammatory anti-Islam film posted online this summer and publicized in recent days. The 14-minute film trailer, which was privately produced in the United States led by a man federal officials identified as Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, mocks the Prophet Mohammed as a womanizer, child molester and ruthless killer. Protesters haven't all been violent, and they represent a fraction of their respective nations' populations: In Egypt, a nation of more than 80 million people, a few thousand have clashed with security forces outside the U.S. embassy in Cairo. Still, confrontations have aggravated relations between the United States and other nations and led to several deaths -- including those of the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three others killed in an attack Tuesday in Benghazi, Libya. The U.N. Security Council issued a statement Friday voicing ""deep concern"" over attacks on diplomatic posts, calling them ""unjustifiable regardless of their motivations."" Clinton said such assaults are misguided and fly in the face of the better society many in these countries recently fought for when they overthrew authoritarian rulers. ""The people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob,"" she said Friday during a ceremony in which the bodies of the four killed in Benghazi returned to the United States. ""Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do everything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts. And we will ... keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the world."" The contrast between then and now was especially evident in Tunisia, birthplace of the Arab Spring. Two years ago, the self-immolation of street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi set off popular unrest that soon led to the downfall of Tunisia's longtime leader, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. On Friday, hundreds of demonstrators -- some belonging to the Salafi movement -- were back on the streets of Tunis, setting their sights on the U.S. Embassy. They burned cars, praised late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, stormed the embassy complex and replaced the U.S. flag with their own black banner, according to witnesses. A nearby American school was ""unusable"" after being badly damaged, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. Two people were killed and more than 20 wounded, interim Tunisian President Al-Munsif Al-Marzouki said later Friday on state-run TV. While asserting the anti-Islam video that stirred outrage ""cannot be justified by claims of freedom of opinion and speech"" (and adding Tunisia plans to sue the filmmaker), al-Marzouki condemned the ""irresponsible, unjustified acts of violence by protesters"" who wrongly blamed the U.S. government for the film. New details emerge about mystery filmmaker . Anti-American protests -- some peaceful, some violent -- were hardly confined to Tunisia. Here's a breakdown of events Friday around the Muslim world: . -- In the Egyptian capital of Cairo, a running battle between police and protesters continued into its fourth day. There was a peaceful demonstration at Tahrir Square, though unrest erupted outside the U.S. Embassy as riot police continued to clash sporadically with protesters. The Interior Ministry issued a statement saying 53 security officers were injured Friday, seven by birdshot. And birdshot was blamed for the death Friday of one protester, whom the Egyptian ministry described as an ex-convict with an extensive criminal record. Thirty of the 142 people arrested since the unrest began Tuesday remain in custody. Read more about clashes in Cairo . -- In Egypt's northern Sinai, Islamist Bedouins staged a protest, a security official said. Militants carrying automatic weapons breached a base housing international peacekeeping troops and burned trucks and a watch tower. The armed clashes injured at least four troops and an Islamist Bedouin. The 1,500-troop mission has supervised the security of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty since 1979. -- In Sudan's capital, Khartoum, protesters got inside the compound with Germany and Britain's embassies. They did not breach the British building, but some got into the German Embassy and pulled down a German flag before police with tear gas forced them to retreat. At least two people died after being run over by a police vehicle, reported the state-run SUNA news agency, calling their deaths ""an accident."" Fifty policemen were injured and protesters set a police car on fire, the report said, citing police forces. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden later Friday called his Sudanese counterpart, Ali Osman Taha, to ""express his concern"" and press Sudan to protect diplomats and their facilities in the African nation. -- In Yemen, police opened fire to stop protesters from reaching the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, eyewitnesses told CNN. Yemeni government forces were sent in and, by late in the day, surrounded the U.S. embassy compound, Nuland said. -- Afghanistan saw its first demonstrations Friday. Hundreds in eastern Nangarhar province burned a U.S. flag and chanted ""Death to America"" and ""We condemn the film."" The demonstration lasted about an hour and ended peacefully, a local official said. The Afghan government has ordered an indefinite block of YouTube to prevent people there from watching the clips and staging violent protests. -- In Gaza, several thousand gathered after Friday prayers and chanted anti-American and anti-Israeli slogans and burned effigies of U.S. President Barack Obama. -- In Syria, hundreds of protesters outside the U.S. Embassy in Damascus waved placards condemning the film and blaming the U.S. administration for allowing it to be produced and broadcast, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. -- In Lebanon, hundreds took to the streets in the northern city of Tripoli, attacking and burning down a KFC restaurant. One person was killed and 25 others wounded in scuffles between protesters and security forces. There also were protests in Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Turkey England, Israel, Nigeria, Malaysia, Bangladesh and India among other locales. Demonstrations were not unexpected: On Thursday, the FBI and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned there could be more violence ""at home and abroad as the film continues to gain attention."" And days before violent protests Tuesday in Egypt, the U.S. Embassy in Cairo was warned by the U.S. intelligence community of concerns about the anti-Islam film that sparked the uproar, a U.S. official told CNN. The cable sent to the embassy did not mention a specific threat. It only warned about the existence of the online movie and the fact that it was gaining attention. Jewish groups mad about early reports on anti-Islam film . U.S. authorities have discounted as false a producer's claims to news outlets that the filmmaker was an Israeli who made the movie with financing from more than 100 Jewish donors. Israel's government denies that the film's maker is Israeli. Despite the firm condemnation by U.S. government officials, some in the Muslim world -- especially those raised in regimes in which the government must authorize any film production -- cannot accept that a movie like ""Innocence of Muslims"" can be produced without being sanctioned by Washington, said Council of Foreign Relations scholar Ed Husain. ""They're projecting ... their experience, their understanding (that) somehow the U.S. government is responsible for the actions of a right-wing fellow,"" said Husain, a senior fellow at the New York think thank. Read Husain's piece explaining dissent in Arab nations . Latest on the investigation into U.S. ambassador's killing . Sources tracking militant Islamist groups in eastern Libya say the Tuesday attack that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens was most likely carried out by a pro-al Qaeda group. Four people have been arrested in connection with the attack, although they were not directly tied to the killings, said Monem Elyasser, the chief aide to Libya's prime minister. Elyasser did not release identities or detail the allegations against the four in custody. The evidence leading to the arrests was based partly on witnesses, but ""mostly pictures that were taken around the compound at that time,"" Libyan Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur told CNNI's Christiane Amanpour. Mohammed al-Megaryef, president of Libya's General National Congress, said he was ""100% sure that (the attack) was preplanned, and it was carried out with the intention to inflict all this damage, all this havoc"" -- including rocking relations between Libya and the United States. He called for ""the international community"" to help Libyan security control militant groups behind such violence. Contrary to al-Megarye's assertion, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Friday that U.S. authorities know of ""no actionable intelligence"" that indicates the Benghazi attack ""was planned or imminent."" What Muslim nations' leaders are saying -- and not -- about violence . The United Nations has asked its non-Libyan staff to temporarily leave Benghazi and head to Tripoli as a ""precautionary measure,"" said Radhia Achouri, head of the U.N. Mission in Libya. And since Tuesday's assault, the U.S. has announced it will fly unmanned drones over Libya and dispatch two warships carrying guided missiles -- the first of which has already arrived off the coast of Libya. U.S. Marine teams have been dispatched to Libya as well as Yemen and Sudan to safeguard American diplomatic posts in those nations, according to U.S. officials. ""Although these security forces are equipped for combat, these movements have been undertaken solely for the purpose of protecting American citizens and property.

"Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) -- The crowd cheers as the stars make their way to the ring for first pro-wrestling bout North Korea has seen in almost 20 years. Back then, we're told the spectators thought the action was real. Now, they're more savvy, and appreciative, clapping loudly as the former American stars execute their maneuvers during the two-day contest in Pyongyang. ""We're here to do something bigger and better,"" pro-wrestler Jon ""Strongman"" Anderson roars backstage. He could also be alluding to the purpose of the trip, an attempt at ""sports diplomacy"" by Antonio Inoki, a Japanese former pro-wrestler turned politician. He's organized the trip at a time of thawing relations between Japan and North Korea over the issue of abductions of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and '80s. Recent talks opened the door for further investigations by North Korea and a report is expected in the next few weeks. The behind-the-scenes diplomacy is a long way from the public spectacles staged during this mixed martial arts festival. The stars of the show -- including former NFL star Bob ""The Beast"" Sapp -- join arm-wrestling and tug-of-war competitions with the Pyongyang locals, some who seem more than a little bemused. Tightly-controlled . International media has joined the tightly-controlled tour, which took us from the birthplace of the nation's founder, Kim Il Sung, to the pet projects of its current leader, Kim Jong Un. A bus ride seemed to take us back in time as we passed fields where locals where working, tending the soil with their hands. Our destination was a country club where, for the equivalent of $10 an hour, locals can ride horses in an indoor arena. It's a past time only for Pyongyang's elite. The country's per capita income is estimated to be around $1,000 to $2,000 a year, putting such pursuits out of reach of most people. However, outside Pyongyang there's a place where anyone can see the country's most impressive monuments, without having to visit each one. It's a theme park that displays North Korea's landmarks in miniature. Many of them could be found in Pyongyang. Indeed, visitors could even see the real-life Tower of Juche from the park. The original, built on the shore of the River Taedong, is named after the political ideology formed by the country's Eternal President Kim Il Sung, that ""man is the master of everything and decides everything."" Then there's the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum and more lessons in North Korean history. We were shown a video that shared the country's perspective on the Korean War (1950-53). It was started by an attack from United States, the video declared. When I questioned this, the guide replied, ""That's what you're taught. This is the truth."" North Korea's military might and successes were paraded in other displays. We were shown a U.S. Navy research ship -- the USS Pueblo -- that was seized in 1968 for allegedly spying on the DPRK. Washington claims it never entered North Korean waters. Photos showing planes and helicopters that had crashed in North Korean territory were also displayed, including a graphic image of a dead U.S. soldier. Asked why it was necessary to display the photo, the guide replied: ""Dead pilot? Because it shows that anybody who violates our sovereignty and intrudes on us to commit espionage must be killed like this."" Pet projects . Since taking power after his father's death in 2011, Kim Jong Un has sought to make his mark on the country and its population of some 25 million people. He's launched a number of pet projects, spending millions on a new Children's Hospital and a slide-filled water park in Pyongyang, which we've seen firsthand during our trip. However, outside Pyongyang it's unclear how far the spending has spread. North Korea remains a secretive state, accused by a United Nations panel of widespread human rights abuses, charges that the country denies. Minders have watched our every move, from the moment we landed in Pyongyang to the bus ride to our hotel, which sits on its own island. The tour has followed pre-approved routes; we're shown what they want us to see. So far, that has been impressive infrastructure for a country that's struggling to feed its own people, and that has erected an almost unassailable boundary between it and the outside world.

"Editor's note: Brian Levin is director of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism and an associate professor at California State University, San Bernardino. He is the editor of the recently published book: ""Hate Crimes: Understanding and Defining Hate Crime"" (Praeger, 2009) and was a 2004 Summer Seminar Scholar at the Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Brian Levin says hate groups feel marginalized by the growing tolerance of diversity in the larger society. SAN BERNARDINO, California (CNN) -- Last Saturday, a young African-American president used eloquent prose to challenge the world to learn from the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust at Germany's Buchenwald concentration camp: ""To this day, there are those who insist that the Holocaust never happened -- a denial of fact and truth that is baseless and ignorant and hateful. This place is the ultimate rebuke to such thoughts; a reminder of our duty to confront those who would tell lies about our history."" Yesterday, less than a mile from the White House, an old bigoted white man was suspected of firing back his response at the place where America tries to draw lessons from that hatred. Yesterday's shooting is the latest in a series of murderous attacks by erratic far-right-wing extremist ""lone wolves"" over the past three months. When shocking violence like this arises, commentators point to various factors including mental illness, political debates and the availability of guns. We, however, must first acknowledge the hand of a small but expanding hate movement as a potent, yet invisible, accomplice that incites and inspires society's disaffected to serve as its most violent warriors. Ironically, it is the movement's decline that makes its violent fringe feel most compelled to act. In April the Department of Homeland Security in a controversial, though ultimately prescient, report concluded, ""the historical election of an African-American president and the prospect of policy changes are proving to be a driving force for right-wing extremist recruitment and radicalization."" That month Richard Poplawski, a 22-year-old with a history of both job failures and anti-Semitic conspiratorial Internet rants, was charged with gunning down and killing three Pittsburgh police officers during an ambush at his home. He was in fear of the ""Obama gun ban"" and the ""evil of the Jews,"" according to the Anti-Defamation League. At the end of May, Scott Roeder, 51, a divorcee with a criminal record and a history of financial difficulties, shot a controversial abortion provider to death at his church in Kansas. Years earlier, after his life began to unravel into fanaticism, he joined an anti-government and anti-Semitic movement called ""The Freemen."" Only days after President Obama's Buchenwald speech, authorities suspect, longtime anti-Semite James von Brunn, an itinerant 88-year-old divorcee from Maryland, decided to make his second armed foray to combat an imagined Jewish plot. Both involved a symbolic government-operated Washington landmark. On December 7, 1981, the 40th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack, during another economic downturn, the then 61-year-old Holocaust denier attempted to enter the Federal Reserve building to kidnap Fed board governors at gunpoint. Von Brunn and other anti-Semites believe that the Federal Reserve is part of a Jewish conspiracy to control the country by subverting the banking system. Similarly, in their view, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum is yet another Jewish government plot to subvert history. For years he railed against the ""browning of America,"" the ""poisoning"" of the gene pool and the ""Holocaust hoax."" Despite the fact that he says he worked for Noontide Press, a publishing outfit owned by arguably the most notorious Holocaust denier, he was never able to get his own anti-Semitic book published. Von Brunn's latest desperate attack comes as he nears the end of his life, and when the hate movement itself as well as the nation are at a crossroads. The shooting comes at a time when society as a whole increasingly rejects the bigotry he strove so long and unsuccessfully to entrench. As a young child, he lived in a nation where the Invisible Empire numbered 4.5 million, thousands of hooded Klansmen marched on the capital, and blacks were segregated and many were lynched. Today, a somewhat resurgent hate movement has grown to a record 926 groups -- up more than 50 percent alone this decade, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Still, the news has not been great for hate groups. The increase comes off of a historic low and appears to be caused in part by a splintering of large groups and the emergence of smaller, less effective ones. In addition, a leadership vacuum has emerged as many of the charismatic hatemongers of the past have died, retired or been incapacitated by prison, ill health or scandal. Unlike the millions of Klansmen of the 1920s, today's hardest core probably number no more than a couple of hundred thousand. More tourists probably visit the Holocaust Museum on a busy day than the total national membership of the Klan. Notwithstanding a spike in some very disturbing racial incidents related to the election of Obama, except for Washington state, the most recent data trickling out shows a decrease or stability in the handful of jurisdictions reporting 2008 hate crimes. The Anti-Defamation League just reported the fourth annual decline in anti-Semitic incidents in the United States, and 65 percent of whites and a record number of blacks, 59 percent, say race relations are good, according to a New York Times/CBS poll. However, all the good news about tolerance, a pending federal hate crime bill, the election of an African-American president and our increasing diversity are seen as nothing less than a final frontal attack on white nationalism itself. For the remaining haters, desperate times and recent attacks may in fact be taken as one last violent call to arms. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brian Levin.","Brian Levin: Hate groups have less support in a more diverse America .

"Beijing (CNN) -- If the latest U.S. intelligence reports are true then North Korea is planning to test-fire not one but multiple missiles, the latest provocative act by its unpredictable young leader. While the region has become used to the posturing from Pyongyang, the recent wave of rhetoric has been unusually sustained and virulent, leading some analysts to consider the possibility of an armed confrontation between the two Koreas -- the neighbors remain technically at war after the 1950-53 conflict ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty. So far Kim Jong Un has refused to listen to the international community, leaving many to wonder if anyone can appeal to the leader, thought to be 30 years old, and defuse the crisis. All eyes are turned on China. Of all the regional powers, analysts say, China has the greatest potential leverage over its traditional ally. Chinese troops fought side by side with the North Koreans during the Korean War that left the Korean peninsula divided. Over the years it has supplied the North with much of its fuel, food and other resources. China could stop doing this at any time but it has rarely done so. ""Chinese netizens say, 'if we squeeze it for one week, what do you do the next week? You have to un-squeeze because we can't let them die,'"" explained Sunny Lee, a South Korean writer and scholar. ""They think it's an ineffective strategy from the start."" Lee says China has tried squeezing the North in 2002 and again in 2006. ""They tried it and realized it did not work,"" he said. It fears the specter of millions of starving refugees crossing into China along its 1,400-kilometer (880 mile) border with North Korea. It also fears a united Korea under the control of South Korea, a close U.S. ally. Lee says China benefits from the status quo and from Pyongyang's brinkmanship. ""When North Korea makes some noise, the U.S. ambassador asks the Chinese ambassador at the United Nations for a dialogue, it becomes a public G-2,"" he said. ""It elevates China's international status. It seems, on the surface, that China has now come around as a respectable global stakeholder."" But Lee said the U.S. benefits too. ""It can pressure South Korea to join its military defense system, it can pressure South Korea to join a regional trading group, and it can sell South Korea more advanced weapons, which are very expensive."" Meanwhile, analysts say a full-scale North Korea attack is unlikely, but they also fear a mishap could unintentionally trigger a localized skirmish -- a fact that has triggered unusually strong statements from Beijing. OPINION: Will China finally 'bite' North Korea? ""No country should be allowed to throw a region into chaos for selfish gains,"" declared President Xi Jinping last Monday, apparently an oblique slap at its wayward ally. North Korea's latest bout of saber rattling began on February 12, when it conducted a third underground nuclear test. The international community reacted with outrage, while the United Nations responded with more sanctions. Even former Cuban leader Fidel Castro, a North Korean ally, warned against conflict last week. He described the current tensions on the peninsula as one of the ""gravest risks"" for nuclear holocaust since the Cuban Missile crisis in 1962. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is visiting China this week to press Beijing to lean on its wayward neighbor. ""Of course they will use their influence,"" Jon Huntsman, the former U.S. ambassador to China, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""The question is will North Korea listen to their admonition? They have influence, but they've been lied to and they've been cheated by North Korea. They know that and they are feeling the sting of it."" Huntsman believes the Chinese have less clout with the North Koreans. ""Business is done by people and they have less of a personal rapport at senior levels with the Korean leadership than they did in the years back,"" he said. None of China's current leadership has met with Kim Jong Un. Last November, China dispatched Li Jianguo, a senior Communist Party official, to Pyongyang in a last-minute effort to convince Kim to forgo its planned nuclear test. Li failed. Since then, there have been no high level exchanges between the two former allies. Indeed the last high-profile foreigner to spend quality time with the young Kim was Dennis Rodman, the eccentric former NBA basketball star. ""You have a friend for life,"" Rodman told Kim after the two men sat next to each other to watch a basketball exhibition in Pyongyang in March. The meeting showed another side of a young man thrust into the seat of power with much to prove, according to Korea watchers. Christopher Hill, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea, said the flurry of tough talk out of Pyongyang shouldn't be ignored, but it could be directed to the citizenry itself. ""I think there's a big element of domestic North Korean politics, if one can understand that concept, where clearly Kim Jong Un is not being well received,"" Hill told CNN recently. ""I think they are trying to kind of boost his status to some sort of wartime leader."" It remains to be seen how far the relatively inexperienced leader will go to shore up his position at home -- even if this pushes the North's traditional ally too far.

"(Health.com) -- Stepped-up colon-cancer screening has helped slash death rates from the disease across the U.S. in recent years, but not all regions of the country have benefited equally. According to a new study from the American Cancer Society, the drop in death rates has been considerably faster in the Northeast than in the South. In the early 1990s, the states with the highest rates of colon-cancer deaths were clustered in the Rust Belt, Mid-Atlantic region, and New England. Within a decade, the study shows, the highest rates could instead be found in the Deep South and Appalachia, thanks to sharp declines in the Northeast. Death rates in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, Maine, and Connecticut all fell by 33% or more during that 10-year span, whereas the decline was 15% or less in six southern states, including West Virginia, Louisiana, and Alabama, according to the study. Health.com: Colon cancer: what increases your risk . In Mississippi, the decrease in the death rate wasn't even statistically significant, making it one of only two states (along with Wyoming) to see no measurable improvement. ""The main factor is really [that] screening rates are lower in the South compared to the Northeast,"" says Ahmedin Jemal, Ph.D., the lead author of the study and the vice president of surveillance research at the American Cancer Society, in Atlanta. Southern states are generally poorer than northern states, and they tend to have more residents without health insurance who may forgo the regular screening that experts recommend for people over age 50, Jemal explains. And as the study notes, Southerners are also more likely to be obese and to smoke -- both known risk factors for colon cancer (also known as colorectal cancer). Health.com: 10 states that consume too much fast food . The new study, which appears in the July issue of the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, follows on the heels of a report released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that highlighted nationwide gains in the fight against colon cancer. Between 2003 and 2007, the percentage of U.S. adults ages 50 to 75 who had ever had a colonoscopy or other screening test increased from 52 to 65%, according to the report. The benefits of the wider screening could be seen in the national death rate from the cancer, which declined from 19 to 16.7 per 100,000 inhabitants over the same period. (Jemal and his colleagues used some of the same data sources as the CDC researchers.) Colon cancer screening saves lives, but more need to do it. The importance of screening is borne out by the state data in the new study, says D. Kim Turgeon, M.D., an associate professor of gastroenterology at the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor. In states that showed reductions in mortality rates of 20% or more between 1990 and 2007, she notes, at least 55% of the target population was screened in 2004. ""All of the states that have really changed their mortality a lot are screening more of the population,"" she says. Poverty is a key factor in the regional disparities seen in the study, says Mira Katz, Ph.D., an associate professor of health behavior and health promotion at the Ohio State University, in Columbus. Not only do poor people have less access to health care, Katz says, but they may also be getting confusing messages about screening. Colonoscopies can be prohibitively expensive if not covered by insurance, but many doctors believe they are the only acceptable option and fail to suggest fecal occult blood tests, a more affordable alternative that uses stool samples. Health.com: Which colon-cancer screening test should you get? ""You have [a] disconnect between what people can afford because they're uninsured, and what providers will recommend,"" Katz says. ""The best colon-cancer screening test is the one that gets done."" The new findings provide more evidence that colon-cancer screening works, but for many people, the tests remain a tough sell, says Leonard Saltz, M.D., head of colorectal oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, in New York City. ""It is hard to convince the average American to go to the doctor when he or she is healthy -- or to convince insurers that money spent on screening now not only saves lives but saves money later,"" he says.

"(CNN) -- Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's health is deteriorating as he struggles with complications from stomach cancer, his lawyer said Monday. ""He has cancer in the stomach, and it's getting worse,"" said Farid El Deeb, the lawyer for Mubarak and his family. The news on Mubarak's condition comes five weeks ahead of his and his two sons' criminal trial. Mubarak, who stepped down amid intense domestic and international pressure earlier this year, is accused of ordering police officers to use live ammunition to kill protesters on January 25 in Cairo's Tahrir Square. The former president could be executed if he is convicted of ordering killings, Egyptian Justice Minister Mohamed Abdelaziz al-Juindy has said. El Deeb has said Mubarak is ""very sad and sorry"" about the allegations, but has no regrets and denies giving any kind of authorization to fire on demonstrators. Mubarak has been held in Sharm el-Sheikh International Hospital in the Red Sea resort community since mid-April after complaining of heart palpitations. Egyptian prosecutors said earlier this month that the former leader is too ill for transfer to a prison hospital in Tora, concluding that the hospital cannot accommodate Mubarak's needs. El Deeb revealed Monday that Mubarak underwent major surgery in June 2010 at a German hospital. Dr. Markus Wolfgang Buchler removed parts of Mubarak's pancreas, gall bladder and a growth on his small intestines. That operation was kept secret, with even top government aides unaware of the procedure, El Deeb said. Buchler, chairman of the surgery department at a hospital in Heidelberg, said Mubarak should receive a comprehensive follow-up every four months for two years after the surgery. ""But the follow-up was completely ignored,"" El Deeb said. According to the general prosecutor, six doctors affiliated with Egypt's military were dispatched to see Mubarak at the Sharm el-Sheikh hospital and released a report on May 24. A week later, on June 1, Egyptian prosecutors released a statement that said Mubarak had repeated irregular heartbeats that, combined with low blood pressure and an ""instant drop in blood circulation in the brain ... leads to instant unconsciousness."" The report also found the former president had an increased risk of heart attack and suffered from depression, fatigue and muscle weakness. Dr. Mohamed El Deeb, a member of the presidential palace medical team who had accompanied Mubarak to Germany for his surgery, asked Buchler if he would visit Mubarak in Sharm el-Sheikh. And the family lawyer, also named El Deeb but no relation to the doctor, said he submitted an official request Thursday asking for permission for the German surgeon to check on Mubarak. Prosecutors forwarded the request to Mohammed Tantawi, head of the ruling military council, ""but we have not heard back from them yet,"" said El Deeb, the lawyer. Egypt's ruler for 30 years, Mubarak stepped down February 11 after an 18-day uprising in which pro-democracy protesters demanded a change in government and reforms. He and his family have been under investigation since the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces and Prime Minister Essam Sharaf's caretaker cabinet took over. Mubarak's sons, Gama and Alaa, are accused of acquiring property at below-market prices, El Deeb said. They face charges of illegal gains and corruption, said Adel Saeed, a spokesman for Egypt's general prosecutor. All three are scheduled to be tried at Cairo Criminal Court on August 3, Saeed said. Aly Hassan, a judicial analyst affiliated with Egypt's justice ministry, recently said Egyptian courts can proceed with a trial even if a defendant is in poor health. ""In previous cases, suspects appeared in court with life-support machines, so Mubarak's health does not mean he is paralyzed,"" Hassan said. ""If he has heart problems and doctors indicate improvement, then he can appear in court for several hours.""","NEW: Mubarak's lawyer has requested a German doctor be allowed to visit him .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Ousted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is ""very sad and sorry"" that he is accused of ordering that live ammunition be fired on protesters, but he has no regrets, his lawyer told CNN Sunday. The former leader is in ""very bad health,"" suffering from a serious heart problem and a resurgence of colon cancer, attorney Farid El Deeb said. ""He doesn't watch TV or anything else,"" El Deeb said in his first interview since the Mubarak family hired him in April. ""They ban him from doing so to avoid more psychological pain. He speaks very little and suppresses a lot of his pain."" El Deeb suggested that his CNN interview will ""probably be the only piece of television he'll watch."" Mubarak faces criminal charges, including using his political position to acquire funds illegally and potentially capital charges of killing protesters. ""He was very sad and sorry because he did not imagine such accusations, especially as he believes that they are all false,"" El Deeb said. His lawyer denied that Mubarak gave any kind of authorization to use force or live ammunition against demonstrators who were calling for his removal. ""Mubarak had expressed his sorrow and had ordered a committee to investigate how they happened,"" he said. More than 800 people lost their lives during Egypt's 18-day revolution, including about 50 police. ""We still need to discover who shot the policemen who were killed during the revolution,"" El Deeb said. A Cairo court, in the first ruling against Mubarak since he was ousted on February 11, fined him and his top officials more than $90 million for their role in cutting the mobile phone network and internet service for five days. Adel Saeed, spokesman for the general prosecutor, said Saturday that Mubarak himself was fined $34 million, former Interior Minister Habib El-Adly $50 million and former Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif $6 million. ""They were charged with cutting the communication to hinder the efforts of the January 25 revolutionaries,"" Saeed said. The blocks began January 28 as demonstrations against Mubarak's rule heightened in Cairo's Tahrir Square. El Deeb denied that Mubarak, his family and friends amassed fortunes at the expense of the Egyptian people. Mubarak's personal wealth is only about six million Egyptian pounds -- about $1 million in U.S. dollars -- ""which he saved from working for 62 years,"" he said. ""He does not own anything else in Egypt or outside of Egypt,"" he said. ""He does not own a single dollar abroad."" Egypt's justice minister told CNN in May that Mubarak's fortune was ""in the billions of dollars."" ""Unfortunately, all the chaos and problems on the Egyptian streets are caused by the minister of justice, Mr. Mohamed Abdel-Aziz El Guindy,"" El Deeb said. ""It has been proven that all his talk is lies."" The lawyer laughed at rumors that Mubarak's two sons are getting VIP treatment in Cairo's Tora prison, where they are awaiting trial on a variety of corruption charges. ""All this is not true,"" he said. ""They're being treated like any other prisoner."" The sons have no contact with their father, he said. Transferring Mubarak to Tora is not an option because the prison hospital does not have a proper intensive care unit, he said. ""Honestly, he is now in very bad health,"" he said. ""He even needs help to go to the bathroom.

"(CNN) -- Will young American voters be as enthusiastic about President Obama's re-election as they were about his candidacy four years ago, when 66% of 18- to 29-year-olds favored him over John McCain? Polls vary widely. But a Public Religion Research Institute survey gives Obama only a 7-point lead over presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney among millennials, while a new Harvard Poll says he has a 17-point lead -- still a worrisome number for Democrats. If 2008 was any indication, an unshakeable youth coalition may be a prerequisite for Democratic victory. The president seems to be listening: He has focused this week on young people, with stops at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of Colorado at Boulder and the University of Iowa in Iowa City. But amid this climate of economic gloom, even apocalypse, for millennials, Obama is rocking the campus vote ... with the single issue of loans? This is certainly a salient policy most directly affecting college students and recent graduates today. They will see reduced loan rates expire without prompt legislative action. And these students undoubtedly will warm, in the short term, to Obama's efforts to sustain the current rates. However, three and a half years after young voters supported Obama as a fixer-in-chief, the economic situation for millennials is in worse shambles, with debt and unemployment climbing for most 18- to 29-year-olds. More than half of recent graduates are unemployed or underemployed, according to a forthcoming study by Northeastern University, says Sheila Palma of the school's Center for Labor Market Studies. Gen Y, people roughly between the ages of 18 and 34, may be the first generation since the New Deal without lasting financial protection. This week, trustees of both Social Security and Medicare reported that the solvency of both programs is slipping, and lawmakers need to take action quickly. A recent CNBC story said that Gen Y has no safety net for retirement beyond market-driven 401(k)s. On top of that risk, the financial hurdles of student loans, a weak housing market, and high unemployment are shaping this generation's deficient savings rate. This is a chilling glimpse into the extinction of the American middle-class for most young citizens. President Obama's narrowly tailored discussion of the loan issue for millennials is not likely to rekindle the ""Yes, We Can"" enthusiasm of 2008 or spur effective policy for young people beyond the college years. Channeling a message of social justice on the loan issue can go only so far. There is the wider issue of affordability -- policy that could make college cost-free for middle-income students -- and the fundamental need to improve millennial social mobility. To galvanize the youth vote anew in 2012, when young people's economic livelihood is at stake, Obama will have to reach deeper than loans. How about a plan for young Americans after college: stronger jobs legislation geared around recent grads? A proposal to reclaim Social Security? The president knows how pivotal the youth vote is for his re-election odds. But his bid for a second term will hinge upon across-the-board substantive answers for young people, so their economic situation is not such a raw one. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alexander Heffner.","Alexander Heffner: Obama on college tour addressed student loans to recapture youth vote .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama will use Tuesday's State of the Union address to frame the message of his re-election campaign. The annual speech to Congress will lay out in clear terms a theme he's been repeating recently about economic inequality and a government that should ensure ""a fair shake"" for all. Democratic sources briefed on the draft speech say it will describe a ""blueprint for an economy that's built to last."" That blueprint will focus on manufacturing, energy, education and middle-class values, according to a video released on the Obama's campaign website and Democratic sources who have been briefed on the address. A Democratic source briefed on the latest draft of the speech said Obama will include a series of proposals, including: . -- Tax reform so that wealthy Americans pay more and the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 expire . -- More refinancing for homeowners in trouble . -- Additional tax breaks for companies that bring back jobs to the United States . -- More clean energy incentives . -- Enhanced education and job-training initiatives, especially for high school graduates seeking technical degrees . -- Establishment of the so-called ""Buffett Rule"" that would set a minimum tax rate for people earning more than $1 million. The president has proposed such steps previously as part of his administration's efforts to spur the nation's still sluggish recovery from the recession. Given the treacherous state of the economy, the president's campaign aides are attempting to make the theme of the upcoming election a choice about the role of government and the future of the middle class -- not a referendum on the president's handling of the economy. They say this speech and its underlying theme -- income inequality -- go a long way to shaping that message. The president will continue to challenge Congress over the ongoing gridlock that blocked most elements of his jobs bill and embroiled Washington in a debt fight last summer. One Democratic official said the president will offer to work with Congress if Congress agrees to work with him. However, this official acknowledged that Obama's tone will not differ significantly from the approach he's taken in recent months when he's attacked Republicans in Congress for general inaction. The speech will build on a theme the president laid out in Kansas last month -- that in today's economy, the game has been rigged against the nation's middle class. Obama will say he wants to return to the ""values"" that define America, where hard work pays off and where responsibility -- not recklessness -- is rewarded. In a December 6 address in Osawatomie, Kansas, Obama described stark differences between a Republican ideology he described as leaving people to fend for themselves and his vision of government that helps provide equal opportunity for all Americans regardless of where they begin in life. ""It's not a view that we should somehow turn back technology or put up walls around America,"" Obama said. ""It's not a view that says we should punish profit or success or pretend that government knows how to fix all society's problems. ""It's a view that says in America, we are greater together -- when everyone engages in fair play, everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share."" Democratic sources told CNN on Sunday that the bullet points of Obama's blueprint will focus on American manufacturing, including ""insourcing"" -- or bringing back jobs from overseas. The sources say he'll argue that during his term, the United States has seen the manufacturing industry grow for the first time in 15 years -- especially in the auto industry that he helped with bailout funds. On the topic of energy, the president will stress alternative energy development and energy independence from unfriendly nations. He'll also tout his record of doubling fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks. The address will include new proposals to prepare American workers and students for the jobs of the future. Obama will also suggest job training for the long-term unemployed and veterans, the sources said. He'll also highlight his record of expanding Pell grants for college students. Throughout his speech, the president will weave in an emphasis on what his administration calls middle-class values, and that this is make-or-break moment for that segment of American society, likely putting it into stark terms, according to the sources. He'll suggest that the United States has a choice to either become a place where only the wealthy succeed, or it can level the playing field and give everyone an opportunity. ""They're big ideas, because we've got to meet the moment, and this speech is going to be about how we do it,"" the president's preview video released over the weekend said. ""We can go in two directions,"" Obama said. ""One is toward less opportunity and less fairness. Or we can fight for where I think we need to go -- building an economy that works for everyone."" Democratic sources told CNN the draft version of the speech will also propose a task force to monitor and enforce trade rules with China, tough language on Iran and seek to put the president's foreign policy actions and vision in context. The day after the speech, the president will begin a three-day swing to states that are expected to be battlegrounds in the upcoming election.

"(CNN) -- Forty years have passed since the military coup in Chile that ushered in a 17-year dictatorship, and a divide remains between those who want to investigate the past and those who want to focus on the future. September 11 is a day that has cast a shadow in Chile since 1973, when the military attacked the presidential palace and put an end to the presidency of socialist leader Salvador Allende. Chilean court confirms Allende suicide . Competing memorials held this week by the government and opposition leaders are a reminder of the lack of unity over how to commemorate the past. There is agreement that the abuses committed under Gen. Augusto Pinochet's military dictatorship -- nearly 2,300 people disappeared and 40,000 were tortured -- should be remembered so that history will not repeat itself. Family of slain Chilean singer Victor Jara seeks justice in U.S. But in an election year, there is a political divide over what it means to remember. President Sebastian Pinera, the first leader from the right since the end of Pinochet's rule, wants to focus on the future. ""The past has already been written,"" he said at the government's official memorial. ""We can recall it, we can study it, we can debate it, but we cannot change it. Because of that, we should not remain prisoners or hostages of that past."" Three out of five Chileans were not born when the coup happened, and the strong feelings of blame that some hold on to should not be passed on to the younger generation, he said. ""We should also ask, 'Why do we want to remember?' To relive the same divisions, violence and hate that caused us so much pain in the past, or to the contrary, to light the path to the future?"" Pinera said. Opposition leaders refused the president's invitation to the event and instead held their own observance at nearly the same time. Among the speakers was Michelle Bachelet, a former president who is running for the highest office once again. ""There is still today a large division between those who justify the dictatorship and those of us who trust in democracy,"" she said. Rather than move on, more investigations are needed to clarify the responsibilities for the abuses under the dictatorship, she said. Reconciliation is not possible, Bachelet said, without an accounting of truth and justice. ""Truth, because we need to know what the victims experienced and what happened to them. And justice, because where justice is denied, impunity fills the void, deepening the divisions,"" she said. The divide was apparent this week. ""Chile should not remain in the past"" and ""should advance toward the future with a solid democracy,"" government spokeswoman Cecilia Perez told reporters. Former President Ricardo Lagos, who also belongs to the center-left coalition that led Chile after the dictatorship, said it was a shame that the current government was unable to host an event that all parties would be willing to attend. Judges weigh in . Outside of the politics, other government bodies sought to publicly make amends. The country's Supreme Court last week offered a mea culpa, saying the judicial system should have done more to protect people's rights in the aftermath of the coup. The high court accepted that it fell short of its responsibilities by not pushing back on the coup government's campaign to arrest and punish opponents. ""I'm proud because the Supreme Court has offered a guarantee that this will not happen again -- that's the significance of this statement,"" Maria Francisca Zapata, vice president of Chile's Association of Judges, told CNN Chile. The court assumed a historic responsibility with its statement, former Justice Minister Luis Bates told CNN Chile. That said, the court was limited in what it could have done under a dictatorship. ""The institutions of the state that have to aid the judges in the investigations of their cases are severely weakened under a dictatorship,"" Bates said. Chilean judge indicts former U.S. military official in 1973 killings . Public opinion continues to shift . As time passes, the views of who was responsible for the coup continue to evolve. A poll by the Chilean Center for Studies of Contemporary Reality found that 41% of respondents blame Pinochet for the coup, an increase of 17 points in 2003. Nine percent of those polled blamed Allende, the socialist president. A small number of Chileans allege that Allende was creating a doomed Marxist system and that there was no option but to overthrow him. Some 16% of those polled said the military did the right thing. In a similar poll 10 years ago, a full 36% said the military was in the right. As the views on the cause of the 1973 coup shift, so do the views of Pinochet. His image gets worse as the years go by, according to the poll. According to the pollster, 1,200 Chileans were surveyed, and the study has a margin of error of 3%. CNN Chile contributed to this report.","Wednesday is the 40th anniversary of the coup that ousted Salvador Allende .

"MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN) -- A state election board on Monday will announce Democrat Al Franken has defeated Republican incumbent Norm Coleman in Minnesota's U.S. Senate race, state officials told CNN Sunday. A board will say Al Franken won the U.S. Senate race by 225 votes, Minnesota's secretary of state says. The canvassing board on Monday will say a recount determined Franken won by 225 votes, Secretary of State Mark Ritchie told CNN. However, Coleman's campaign, which contends the recount should have included about 650 absentee ballots it says were improperly rejected in the initial count, has indicated it will challenge the certification. Coleman campaign manager Cullen Sheehan said his team believes the recount process was broken and that ""the numbers being reported will not be accurate or valid."" ""The effort by the Franken campaign, supported by the secretary of state, to exclude improperly rejected absentee ballots is indefensible and disenfranchises hundreds of Minnesota voters,"" Sheehan said. After the results are certified, Coleman's campaign will have seven days to file a challenge. The initial count from the November 4 election put Coleman, a first-term senator, 215 votes ahead of Franken -- known for his stint on NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" and as a former talk-show host on progressive radio network Air America. The slim margin triggered an automatic recount. During the recount, Franken's campaign alleged that thousands of absentee ballots had been improperly rejected and asked that they be counted. The state's Supreme Court eventually ordered that rejected absentee ballots be counted if local officials and each campaign could agree that the selected ballots were rejected mistakenly. About 950 initially rejected absentee ballots were counted Saturday after all parties agreed on them. However, Coleman's campaign said about 650 other rejected absentee ballots -- many of them from pro-Coleman areas -- also were improperly rejected and should have been counted. The Coleman campaign has also alleged that more than 100 ballots may have been accidentally counted twice and may have unfairly benefited Franken. ""When a candidate is leading because of double counted votes, and votes that get counted even when ballots don't exist, it clearly means that a [post-election challenge] is the only likely remedy to ensure a fair outcome,"" Sheehan said. Franken's attorney, Marc Elias, in a statement said: ""The next step is the canvass board's meeting tomorrow, where we have every expectation they will declare that Al Franken won this election."" Deputy Secretary of State Jim Gelbmann, who oversaw Saturday's tallying of the 950 improperly rejected absentee ballots, said the only thing left for the canvassing board to do Monday is certify the numbers. The board's meeting will convene at 2:30 p.m. ""Candidates may have objections or suggestions or comments that they want to make,"" Gelbmann said. ""I would assume the canvassing board will allow that as long as they're brief."" Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York and chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, issued a statement Sunday declaring Franken the winner and expressing confidence Franken would remain on top following any legal battle. ""There is no longer any doubt who will be the next senator from Minnesota,"" Schumer said. ""Even if all the ballots Coleman claims were double counted or erroneously added were resolved in his favor, he still wouldn't have enough votes to win."" Schumer also said it is ""crucial"" Minnesota's second seat in the Senate not go empty, implying Franken should be seated when the rest of the Senate convenes to be sworn in Tuesday. Minnesota's other seat is held by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat. Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has pledged a GOP filibuster if the Democrat-controlled Senate attempts to seat Franken before all legal battles play out and before Minnesota's Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a Republican, can co-sign the secretary of state's certificate. Ritchie said the state has no problem with not having two sworn-in senators Tuesday until the process is completed.","Recount tally favoring Al Franken will be announced Monday, Minnesota officials say .

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- A few miles south of the town of Starobeshevo in eastern Ukraine, a group of men in uniform is slumped under a tree. They are dejected and exhausted, their eyes red with fatigue. They do not want to be filmed but tell us of the horror they endured a day earlier. As medics with the Ukrainian army, they had transported the bodies of some 70 soldiers away from a combat zone and many more who were seriously wounded. They scarcely raise their heads when a Ukrainian air force jet streaks across the sky, releasing its payload on a rebel-held area to the east. It's the only action by the air force that we've witnessed against a rebel force that's suddenly gone on the offensive across a wide area of eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko warned Saturday that the crisis with Russia has worsened in recent days and is inching closer to a ""full-scale war."" Border guard bases and checkpoints deserted . The drive north from the port city of Mariupol -- only a couple of miles from the Russian border -- offered no evidence of a Ukrainian presence. Bases of the border guard service are deserted, checkpoints on rural roads abandoned, sandbags strewn along the verge. In effect, Ukraine has forfeited control of perhaps as much as 200 miles of its eastern border. The Ukrainians claim that Russian artillery fired from across the border is helping the rebels advance and that thousands of Russian troops are mixed in with the separatists. Moscow denies both claims. 6 questions -- and answers -- about the crisis in Ukraine . Certainly the rebel forces, now united under the banner of Novorossiya -- or New Russia -- are better armed and organized than they were two months ago. They have at least some T-72 tanks; many carry new weapons. And after spending months on the defensive, they are suddenly buoyant. By contrast, a small detachment of Ukrainian troops we encountered on the way north seemed demoralized. One asked when the British Army would arrive to help Ukraine in its desperate need; another gloomily predicted a rebel onslaught at any moment. When we finally reached Starobeshevo, a rebel checkpoint had been hastily erected at the edge of town. The men were sunburned and relaxed, waving us through without even checking documents, a rarity in a country where both sides relish leafing through passports. The town itself fell to the pro-Russian separatists Friday, part of an advance south that has encircled the remnants of the Donbass Battalion, a volunteer militia fighting alongside government forces. Several houses had been badly damaged and at least one was destroyed by a direct hit. Locals said Ukrainian fire was to blame, but there is no way to prove it. The shrapnel cut jagged holes in the metal fence of the modest home opposite and damaged the roof. The elderly couple who lived there seemed shocked by the violence that had erupted around their rural community. The husband, Victor, said he was pure Ukrainian but accused the government of lying to the people. ""The Ukrainians came like peacekeepers,"" he said, ""but then they kill us. They're destroying the whole Donbass region."" But Victor, who is 80, isn't about to be run out of the town where he was born. An eerie quiet in Donetsk . As we finished speaking with Victor, a battered black sedan with a flak jacket hanging over the driver's door pulled up, and a NovoRossiya fighter got out. He told us we must stop filming unless we could show press accreditation. But accreditation could be obtained only in Donetsk, a city not so easy to enter now with the Ukrainian army shelling it. Soon the fighter's commander was on the scene, a tall man in his early 40s with an air of natural authority. ""You know I can just take away your camera,"" he said. We were not in a position to argue. Instead he put two of his men in our minivan and dispatched us with an escort to Donetsk, some 30 miles away. As the vehicle raced across open country, they trained their Dragonov rifles out of the window, whether for show or because Ukrainian units were still in the area was unclear. After a few minutes at the State Security building in Donetsk, now the military headquarters of the separatists, we were allowed to go but advised not to leave the city until our accreditation was in order. In any case, trying to leave Donetsk in the late afternoon, when the shelling and rocket fire picks up, didn't seem the smartest idea. Compared with two months ago, the city is eerily quiet. The outdoor cafes and parks that were crowded in the early summer are deserted and more stores are boarded up. Shells have hit the stadium of the football club, Shakhtar, and wrecked apartment buildings. It seems most of the people who are still here are those with nowhere else to go, caught in the middle of a war that threatens to lurch into the bitterly cold winter.","With rebel forces on offensive in eastern Ukraine, evidence of a military presence is scarce .

"(CNN) -- Many expected Xi Jinping to focus on internal politics in his first year in office and not make major external moves, but in fact China is busy designing and implementing a bolder foreign policy in light of an anticipated U.S. decline. This strategy was made clear this weekend as Beijing mapped out airspace over a disputed island chain in the East China Sea and released rules that it says must be followed by all aircraft entering the zone -- under penalty of intervention by China's military. Unlike his predecessors, Xi is making foreign policy with the mindset of a great power, increasingly probing U.S. commitments to its allies in the region and exploiting opportunities to change the status quo. China's recent rhetoric and actions show a move from a defensive, reactive, and image-conscious policy to a proactive approach designed to further China's vital interests. Officials in China have begun using new diplomatic language, with decades-old terms sloughed off to allow more room to maneuver. Traditional mantras like ""non-interference"" and ""hide our capacities and bide our time"" are no more under Xi, whose new slogan is the ""Chinese dream,"" a vision for the national rejuvenation of the Chinese people. And in the U.S.-China relationship, U.S. diplomats used to frame the debate with terms such as ""responsible stakeholder"" in the global system. But China has now put forth its own catch phrase: a ""new type of great power relations,"" in which the U.S. recognizes China's core interests and respects it as an equal. China's reforms: Letting the economy fly more freely . China's actions also demonstrate a more activist external strategy. Regionally, maritime security interests have taken precedence in China's strategic rationale. Even before officially taking power, Xi was made head of the maritime small group that presided over Beijing's swift and decisive response to Japan's September 2012 purchase of three disputed islands in the East China Sea from their private owner. By declaring territorial baselines around the islands, increasing the number and length of its law enforcement patrols, and introducing military forces in the vicinity, China has challenged Japan's de facto control of the area and moved to solidify its own claims. China's demarcation of a new ""Air Defense Identification Zone"", which includes the disputed islands - known as the Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan - underscores these goals. In the South China Sea, China has played a double game, calling for the peaceful settlement of disputes through bilateral negotiations and engaging in a wide-ranging charm offensive, while simultaneously trying to gain control of disputed territories. The cancellation of President Obama's October trip to the region, forced by the U.S. government shutdown, greatly assisted Xi. It left him as the star attraction at regional gatherings where U.S.-China rivalry features strongly, and Xi made the most of the attention by announcing a slew of new deals across Southeast Asia. China initially left the Philippines out of its largesse to punish it for submitting their maritime dispute to international arbitration and to warn other Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries against doing the same. Central Asia and the Middle East . Xi has also acted strongly to protect other interests. He swept through Central Asia in September to forge closer trade ties at a time when the U.S. is disengaging from Afghanistan and the region. China has recently splashed cash there to secure access to petroleum resources beyond the reach of the U.S. navy. And China and Russia continue to engage in joint multi-polarity to keep the U.S. in check while furthering their energy relationship. In the Middle East, where traditionally China has been content to have the U.S. play the decisive political role, Xi has made moves calibrated to establish a presence without becoming mired in the region's disputes. With China expected to become even more dependent on oil from the region, Beijing realizes that instability there could jeopardize supply. In May, Xi received both Mahmoud Abbas and Benjamin Netanyahu, issued a 'four point peace plan,' and offered to host an Israeli-Palestinian peace summit. While the components of the plan are not new and the offer has not been accepted, the initiative showed that as its power and interests grow, China will act when affected by issues outside its neighborhood. North Korea . Closer to home, Xi has sharply distinguished himself from his predecessor in dealing with North Korea. Where Hu was indulgent , Xi has laid down some ""house rules,"" signing up to sanctions and employing bolder rhetoric against the wayward neighbor. But when North Korea walked back its provocations, Xi angered the U.S. and South Korea by dispatching Vice-President Li Yuanchao to Pyongyang to attend a military parade marking the 60th anniversary of the end of the Korean War. His presence was a potent symbol, showing that China's pique over North Korea's earlier actions didn't preclude Beijing from trying to repair relations there. American preferences on North Korea are less and less central to China's decision-making; unless the U.S. takes measures on the Peninsula that China sees as undermining its regional security. Xi has also doubled down on involvement in Myanmar, which plays an increasingly important role in China's energy security and where China fears that American engagement efforts are part of a U.S. strategic encirclement of China. Taken together, Xi's decisions and words illustrate a more active strategy. And we are likely to see an even more self-confident Chinese foreign policy as he continues his decade of rule. Because Xi's domestic agenda and China's external agenda are intertwined. Xi's crafting of the ""Chinese Dream"" as a vessel for party legitimacy also more closely yokes the party's fortunes to its performance as a defender of national interests and ambitions. And in his pronouncements on ideology, and by establishing a new national security council, Xi has made clear that he sees a link between ideological menaces to one-party rule and strategic threats abroad, especially from the United States. Nationalists, especially online, continue to demand that the government use its new-found international heft to more actively and directly defend China's global interests. Xi is likely to make efforts to deliver, and in so doing will effectively end the traditional Chinese policy of non-intervention. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, Director of Asia-Pacific Programs at the U.S. Institute of Peace .","China is busy designing and implementing a bolder foreign policy .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has waded deep into the effort to deal with the aftermath of the world's worst nuclear accident in a quarter century. His government said Tuesday it would spend the equivalent of $470 million to try to tackle the alarming toxic water crisis at the country's tsunami-crippled nuclear power plant. National authorities are stepping in as Tokyo Electric Power Company struggles to cope with an array of daunting problems at its stricken Fukushima Daiichi plant. The move is a gamble for Abe, who comfortably won elections last year and has so far remained popular. Why Fukushima is worse than you think . ""Today, instead of the previous stopgap countermeasures, we have put together a basic policy for countering the contaminated water issue,"" Abe said after a ministerial meeting Tuesday. TEPCO has accumulated a huge volume of tainted water at the site since a massive earthquake and tsunami in 2011 set off meltdowns at three of the plant's reactors. A litany of leaks . Last month, it said one of roughly 1,000 huge storage tanks at the site had leaked 300 tons of toxic water, prompting Japan's nuclear regulator to declare the situation a Level 3 serious incident, its gravest assessment since the meltdowns at the plant in 2011. TEPCO looks for outside help to stabilize Fukushima . Now, the regulator says it suspects more leaks from other containers after the company detected high radiation levels in some parts of the water storage system over the weekend. TEPCO is also having difficulty managing the large quantities of groundwater that flow into and out of the area around the plant each day. In July, it admitted that radioactive groundwater was leaking into the Pacific Ocean from the site, bypassing an underground barrier built to seal in the water. Michael Friedlander, a former nuclear plant operator and engineer, described the groundwater problem as one of the biggest long-term issues at the plant. ""It's like having a leak in your basement,"" he told CNN Tuesday. Government measures . Amid mounting concerns about the crisis and TEPCO's ability to deal with it, Abe said last month his government would step in. Fukishima tuna study finds miniscule health risks . In the plan outlined Tuesday, the government said it intends to spend roughly $320 million on a technologically challenging project to freeze the ground around the reactors to prevent groundwater from leaking into the plant and carrying radioactive particles with it as it seeps out. Japan ponders freezing ground . The plan to freeze the ground had already been proposed by TEPCO, but the government says it is trying to speed up measures to get a grip on the water crisis. It earmarked a further $150 million for a new, more effective processing system for the tainted water at the plant. Authorities will also replace water storage tanks that are held together by bolts with welded tanks, which have a lower risk of leaking. The three main elements of the government's plan are to decrease the amount of contaminated water in and underneath the reactor buildings and surrounding trenches, keep groundwater away from already toxic water and prevent tainted water from seeping into the ocean. Frozen ground . The plan to freeze the ground around the reactors is particularly ambitious. The Japanese government has previously described the task as ""unprecedented."" The technology has been used before in the construction of tunnels, but never on the massive scale that the Fukushima plant would require. It also has never been used for the years or decades that experts think will be needed at the plant. It is likely to involve plunging tubes carrying a powerful coolant liquid deep into the ground. The liquid would freeze the ground solid so that no groundwater could pass through it. Friedlander said that the ground freezing is ""a good solution as an interim fix"" until the leaks underneath the reactors are permanently sealed. TEPCO has been grappling with water issues ever since the plant was hit by the natural disasters in 2011. The resulting meltdowns constituted the second-worst nuclear accident in history, trailing only the 1986 disaster at Chernobyl, in the former Soviet Union. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki reported from Tokyo and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Junko Ogura contributed to this report.","The prime minister vows to move on from TEPCO's ""stopgap countermeasures""

"(CNN) -- The United States has been rudely reminded that Russia is a major power with different values, ambitions and goals than America's. Putin's brazen move to assert Russian interests, in Crimea in particular and Ukraine in general, seems to have come as a shock to many leaders in the Obama administration and to most of the American news media. President Barack Obama had after all ridiculed Sen. John McCain in 2008 and Gov. Mitt Romney in 2012 for suggesting that Russian policy could become a major problem. Then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton dramatically pushed a reset button to demonstrate the Obama team's commitment to working with Russia. President Obama, not realizing he was on an open microphone, promised then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that once he was past the election he could be more flexible in accommodating Russian concerns. All this naive fantasy of a ""good Russia"" has been shattered in the last week. The earlier overly positive statements have been replaced with a tendency to demonize President Vladimir Putin. For example, Clinton has moved from her reset button to comparing Putin to Adolf Hitler (a comparison she can't possibly have meant but which is a perfect case study in the hysteria to which symbolic liberalism is prone). Strong words mask a position of weakness. As former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has observed, calling Putin names is not a substitute for a strategy. The United States has virtually no tactical cards it can play in the Crimea. We are not going to confront the Russians militarily. The local population of Crimea is at least 60% Russian-speakers. Association with Russia might win a popular referendum (thus putting the democracies in a real dilemma). On the other hand, Putin may reconsider the idea of independence for Crimea because the pro-Russian voters are needed to win in Ukraine overall. If the heavily pro-Russian Crimea were no longer in Ukraine, the pro-Western forces would be substantially stronger in Kiev. Whatever happens in the next few weeks in Crimea, the United States has a very limited tactical ability to affect it. The United States and our allies can do a fair amount to help the rest of Ukraine stay independent and we should commit to that project. However, in the long run there is a much greater threat that the United States has to confront. The very principles that led Putin to use force in Crimea could be applied to the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. There are a lot of ethnic Russians in all three countries (and especially in Estonia). They are much closer to Russia than is Crimea -- it is 228 miles from Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, to St. Petersburg. The great difference is that the three Baltic states are members of NATO. Any Russian adventurism in this area could force the enormous choice of either directly confronting Russia in its own neighborhood or allowing NATO to collapse because we are unwilling to meet our treaty obligations. Convincing Putin that we take seriously his toughness and his determination, and we are prepared to meet it, could be a vital step toward avoiding a future disaster. There are some key steps we can take toward achieving that goal: . -- First, move to increase the production of oil and gas, thus dramatically lowering the price of oil, thereby cutting into Putin's ability to earn hard currency. -- Second, wean the Europeans off their dependence on Russian natural gas as one of their biggest suppliers, thus lowering Putin's ability to exercise influence over the European community. -- Third, strengthen the ability of Ukraine to produce its own energy so it has both a healthier economy and no longer relies on Putin and Russia as its main source of energy. -- Fourth, strengthen American military capabilities to show that we recognize that Putin is more dangerous than we thought and that we are prepared to strengthen our ability to deal with any threat he might bring to bear, particularly on our NATO allies in the Baltic. The Congress should call on the President to immediately issue an executive order to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which will reduce the price of oil worldwide by getting more oil to market faster. Each drop in the dollars that Putin can get weakens his ability to undertake foreign adventures. The President should also sign an executive order lifting the ban on selling natural gas to Europe. After all, since the executive order the President issued on Thursday indicates this is ""a national emergency,"" then there are serious things we can do in a national emergency. This President has already proven a willingness to use executive orders widely. This would be one that would weaken and undermine Putin, while also beginning to liberate the Europeans from dependence on Russia. Obama should also immediately open closed offshore and federal land to drill for natural gas and oil. The more oil and gas the United States produces, the further we can drive down costs, leaving the Russians weaker and with fewer resources. There are 24 liquid natural gas projects tied up in the federal bureaucracy. A presidential executive order could liberate them and send the clear signal the United States is prepared to replace Russia as the natural gas supplier of last resort. This would clearly signal the Europeans that in the next few years they will have an alternative to being blackmailed by Putin. Remember, it was President Reagan's strategy to drive down the price of oil to $11 a barrel that eventually bankrupted the Soviet Union and gave Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev no choice but to sign a series of agreements that recognized the decline of the Soviet Union. If Clinton was both sincere and serious in comparing Putin to Hitler when she related the action in the Crimea to the action that Hitler took in Czechoslovakia in 1938, then she would be demanding that we dramatically strengthen rather than weaken American defense. The President should announce that he is directing the Joint Chiefs to significantly re-evaluate the budget in order to be more than adequately prepared for any possible contingency. This would send a signal in the real world that the Russians would understand. What we have so far is symbolic liberalism offering words, symbolic liberalism flying around the world from capital to capital having meetings, and symbolic liberalism targeting narrowly a handful of people in a way that will have no impact on Putin. What we could have is serious, robust action that would have a genuine and immediate impact and would weaken Russia's ability to act aggressively toward its neighbors. This is the time to determine, are we serious about confronting Putin over the long run? Or after a few symbolic games, is the administration going to accommodate the new reality that Putin is creating? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Newt Gingrich.","Gingrich: Crimea action reminds U.S. that Russia has different values, goals, ambitions .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A series of civil lawsuits against defense contractors KBR and its former parent company Halliburton claims the companies endangered the health of U.S. troops and contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan by unsafely burning massive amounts of garbage on U.S. bases. Burn pits produced thick black smoke and toxic fumes, according to plaintiff Richard Guilmette. Six lawsuits were filed Tuesday and three more are scheduled to be filed Wednesday in state courts on behalf of current and former military personnel, private contractors and families of men who allegedly died because of exposure to the fumes from the burning garbage. Attorneys for the plaintiffs also are seeking to file a class-action suit. The lawsuits are the first coordinated effort by plaintiffs to extract damages for the claimed health effects from the burn pits. The military has acknowledged the concerns but said its own test of the most notorious case, the Balad Air Force Base burn pit, found there is no prolonged health risk for those who were exposed for a year or less to the fumes. But the military's report on the fumes also acknowledged it cannot account for all the items burned in the Balad pit. At one point the open pit burned everything from plastics and food to medical waste, with jet fuel used as an accelerant at times. The lawsuits, filed Tuesday in Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Minnesota, New York and North Carolina, seek damages ""in an amount sufficient to strip defendants of all of the revenue and profits"" earned. KBR and Halliburton were paid millions of dollars to oversee the waste management for the military. One plaintiff, Richard Guilmette of Enterprise, Alabama, said he lived in a tent close to a burn pit while deployed by the Army to Kandahar, Afghanistan. Guilmette's suit describes winds blowing ""the thick black smoke and toxic fumes from the burn pit"" into the tent where he lived from March 2004 to March 2005. The suit claims Guilmette suffered a series of health problems, from severe chest pain and diarrhea, to asthma, sleep apnea and debilitating migraine headaches. A lawsuit filed for Michael Moore of Hinesville, Georgia, claims the plaintiff was exposed to ""toxic fumes"" while deployed to the Balad Air Force Base in Iraq in 2005 and 2006. Moore lived ""less than 50 yards"" from the burn pit, according to the suit. His suit claims he developed a chronic cough while there that woke him with coughing and choking. Ultimately he was evacuated and diagnosed with severe sleep apnea and breathing problems. According to the filing, Moore previously ""was in excellent health and physical shape, running six miles every day."" In all there are 70 plaintiffs who will file suits, according to lead attorney Elizabeth Burke. The lawsuits filed Tuesday and Wednesday represent 21 plaintiffs, with an addition 50 or so suits to still be filed, according to Burke. ""They sought profit in lieu of safety,"" Burke said of the KBR and Halliburton. KBR had not reviewed the complaints and would not comment to CNN on the specific allegations. ""The general assertion, however, that KBR knowingly harmed soldiers or contractors is unfounded,"" KBR said in a statement given to CNN. ""The safety and security of all employees and those the company serves remains KBR's top priority."" A Halliburton spokeswoman told CNN the company had not been served with the suits and therefore could not comment on any of the allegations directly. However, spokeswoman Cathy Mann said if the allegations are in regard to KBR activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, then Halliburton believes it has been improperly named. ""We would expect Halliburton to be dismissed from the suits as Halliburton would have no responsibility, legal or otherwise, for the actions alleged. Further, it would be inappropriate for Halliburton to comment on the merits of a matter affecting only the interest of KBR,"" Mann said in an e-mail to CNN.","6 lawsuits filed Tuesday; 3 more are scheduled to be filed Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- The European Union Court of Justice has ruled that working fathers in Spain have the same right to breastfeeding leave as do moms. Thursday's ruling grants Spanish dads the same rights as the mother of their child to leave work up to twice a day for a total of an hour or to shorten their workday by 30 minutes for the first nine months of the baby's life. The court called the law ""an unjustified discrimination on grounds of sex"" that fathers weren't granted breastfeeding leave in the same instances as women were. The statute, challenged by Pedro Manuel Roca Alvarez, didn't allow dads to take the same leave afforded to women if the mother of their children didn't work or were self-employed. The law was ""liable to perpetuate a traditional distribution of the roles of men and women by keeping men in a role subsidiary to that of women in relation to the exercise of their parental duties.""","The Spanish law allows parents to shorten their workday for breastfeeding leave .

"(CNN) -- A North Carolina judge set aside the death sentence of a convicted killer after concluding Friday that race played a role in the case, a landmark ruling that may call into question a number of death row cases in the state. The ruling by Cumberland County Superior Court Judge Gregory Weeks, the first under the state's controversial Racial Justice Act, means that 38-year-old Marcus Robinson now faces life in prison without the possibility of parole. Robinson, who is black, was convicted of first-degree murder in 1994. At the center of the judge's ruling is a finding that prosecutors across the state participated in the practice of excluding potential black jurors. ""Robinson introduced a wealth of evidence showing the persistent, pervasive and distorting role of race in jury selection throughout North Carolina,"" Weeks wrote in his ruling. ""The evidence, largely unrebutted by the State, requires relief in his case and should serve as a clear signal of the need for reform in capital jury selection proceedings in the future."" Weeks did not question whether the crime was committed by Robinson, who was convicted of killing a white, 17-year-old teen -- Erik Tornblom. Passed by the state Legislature and signed into law in 2009, the Racial Justice Act states ""no person shall be subject to or given a sentence of death, or shall be executed pursuant to any judgment that was sought or obtained on the basis of race."" Under the law, those with death sentences can appeal by using statistical analysis to prove race played a role in how their case was handled. The cornerstone of Robinson's appeal is a Michigan State University study of jury selection in North Carolina in 1994, the time during which Robinson was sentenced, that found prosecutors struck blacks from juries at a rate of more than 2-to-1 compared with whites. In the ruling, Weeks found that not only did prosecutors across the state intentionally use the race of a potential juror as a significant factor in decisions to exercise preemptory challenges -- the practice of striking somebody from a jury without explanation, but that the practice occurred in Robinson's case. The North Carolina Conference of District Attorneys strongly disputed that race had anything to do with death sentences in effect across the state. ""While we respectfully disagree with Judge Weeks, we are not surprised by his ruling,"" the group said in a written statement. The group has been opposed to the Racial Justice Act, saying that cases should not be decided by generalized statistics presented years after a conviction. ""Capital cases reflect the most brutal and heinous offenders in our society. Whether the death penalty is an appropriate sentence for murderers should be addressed by our lawmakers in the General Assembly, not masked as claims (of) racism in our courts,"" the statement said. Robinson is among 157 death row inmates -- 83 blacks, 63 whites and 12 other ethnicities -- who filed appeals under the Racial Justice Act, according to records from the North Carolina Department of Public Safety. The NAACP in North Carolina, meanwhile, expressed their sympathies to the family of Robinson's victim, while lauding the ruling. ""We take this moment to remind prosecutors and their staffs that the Racial Justice Act mentions the idea of training program, to help weed out racial bias as they exercise their broad discretion in capital cases,"" said the Rev. William J. Barber II, president of the NAACP in North Carolina. ""We encourage the Association of District Attorneys to take advantage of such training to drain some of the unconscious and conscious racial bias out of our courthouses."" After Friday's ruling, Robinson's mother Shirley Burnes told CNN affiliate WTVD that her son expected Friday's decision ""because it was true facts, and that's it."" She said she understood that the ruling could make way for other such successful appeals in North Carolina. ""This has been a hard long journey,"" Burnes said. ""And there are others out there who will be affected by this."" CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","Marcus Robinson was sentenced to death after being convicted of murder in 1994 .

"(CNN) -- The House on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved a $16 billion bill to overhaul the Department of Veterans Affairs. It is a bipartisan response to the scandal over delayed care at medical facilities and allegations of alarming management shortcomings at the sprawling federal agency that serves millions of veterans. The Senate is expected to vote on the plan as early as Thursday. The legislation would provide money for new medical facilities, more doctors and nurses, and a new program that will allow some veterans to seek health care outside the VA system. On Tuesday, the Senate confirmed Robert McDonald as the new VA secretary. He replaces Eric Shinseki who resigned in May over the scandal, key details of which were revealed by a CNN investigation.

"(CNN) -- Demonstrations in support of immigrants' rights are scheduled Saturday in at least 21 states, the District of Columbia and two Canadian provinces. In all, protests are planned for 47 cities. The demonstrations come amid a swirl of controversy surrounding a new immigration law in Arizona that allows police to demand proof of legal residency. Arizona lawmakers say the law is needed because the federal government has failed to enforce border security with Mexico, allowing more than 450,000 illegal immigrants to move into in the state. Critics say the law is unconstitutional and will lead to racial profiling, which is illegal. But Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer and others who support SB1070 say it does not involve profiling or other illegal acts. The Arizona legislature passed a series of changes to the law late Thursday in an attempt to address the accusations that the measure will lead to profiling. The law, which does not go into effect for 90 days, has already drawn at least two lawsuits and condemnation from the Mexican government and other Latin American nations. Prominent entertainers, including Shakira and Linda Ronstadt, also have spoken out against the law. Some critics are calling for a boycott of Arizona, urging that tourists stay away and that no one do business with companies in the state. On Friday, two San Francisco, California, officials wrote a three-page letter to Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig to ask that the 2011 All-Star Game be moved from Phoenix, Arizona, if the law is not repealed. The Major League Baseball Players Association, the players' union, is also voicing its disapproval of the law. ""The recent passage by Arizona of a new immigration law could have a negative impact on hundreds of Major League players who are citizens of countries other than the United States,"" Michael Weiner, executive director of the association, said in a prepared statement Friday. ""These international players are very much a part of our national pastime and are important members of our Association. Their contributions to our sport have been invaluable, and their exploits have been witnessed, enjoyed and applauded by millions of Americans. All of them, as well as the Clubs for whom they play, have gone to great lengths to ensure full compliance with federal immigration law. ... ""The Major League Baseball Players Association opposes this law as written. We hope that the law is repealed or modified promptly. If the current law goes into effect, the MLBPA will consider additional steps necessary to protect the rights and interests of our members."" Also Friday, National Urban League President Marc Morial announced that the civil rights organization is suspending consideration of Phoenix -- which had submitted a bid -- as the location for its 2012 conference ""as long as this unfortunate law remains in effect."" ""The law is repugnant not just to people of color but to all Americans who value fairness, decency, and justice,"" said Morial, who added that no site in the state would be considered unless the law is repealed or overturned. The organization is expected to announce the winning location for the convention at its 2010 conference in late July. In addition, the African-American Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity announced it is pulling its July 2010 convention from Phoenix and moving it to Las Vegas, Nevada, because of what its board called ""the egregious immigration act signed recently by the governor of Arizona."" ""It was the full opinion of the board that we could not host a meeting in a state that has sanctioned a law which we believe will lead to racial profiling and discrimination, and a law that could put the civil rights and the very dignity of our members at risk during their stay in Phoenix, Arizona,"" the fraternity's board said. Though perhaps not as vocal, the law also has plenty of supporters. Some have launched a ""BUYcott,"" in which they urge people to spend money in the state to support the measure. Backers applaud Arizona legislators for taking seriously their concerns about illegal immigration and crime. Arizona's new law requires immigrants to carry their registration documents at all times and mandates that police question people if there is reason to suspect they're in the United States illegally. The measure makes it a state crime to live in or travel through Arizona illegally. It also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them. Brewer signed the law last week, and the legislature changed some language in it Thursday night in an attempt to make it less ambiguous as to how and when people can be questioned about their residency. Brewer signed the changes into law Friday, saying they will ease concerns about racial profiling. According to the bill the governor signed April 23, police would be able to detain an individual based merely on the suspicion that he or she entered the country illegally. A change that legislators approved Thursday night, however, says police could check on residency status only while enforcing some other law or ordinance. An officer could ask about an immigrant's status, for example, while investigating that person for speeding, loitering or some other offense. In addition, the law says Arizona's attorney general or a county attorney cannot investigate complaints based ""solely"" on factors such as a person's race, color or national origin. The changes that legislators approved Thursday night would remove the word ""solely,"" to emphasize that prosecutors must have some reason other than an individual's race or national origin to investigate. Read the full text of Senate Bill 1070 (PDF) The Arizona law will be the focus of Saturday's May Day immigration demonstrations, which have been held yearly since 2006. Eleven protests are scheduled in California, with two in Los Angeles. New York has eight protests slated, including five in New York City. In Canada, demonstrations are planned in Toronto and Vancouver. The protests are being organized by the National Immigrant Solidarity Network and are being billed as ""May Day 2010 -- National Mobilization for Immigrant Workers Rights."" Demonstrators want immigration reform that will lead to an easier path toward legal residency and citizenship. ""We have an immigration system that has been neglected for 30 years,"" said Clarissa Martinez of the National Council of La Raza. The Arizona law is not the answer, she said. ""That leads to greater chaos over that broken system,"" Martinez told CNN. President Obama has called on Congress to pass a comprehensive immigration reform law this year. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other top Democratic senators unveiled the outlines of that legislation late Thursday. But House Minority Leader John Boehner said at a briefing Thursday that ""there's not a chance"" that Congress will approve the measure this year, especially after the recent passage of health care reform. Obama conceded this week that immigration reform is not likely this year. The Arizona law has raised concerns in Mexico and throughout Latin America, U.S. officials say. ""It comes up ... in every meeting we have with the region,"" State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Thursday. ""We are hearing the concerns of the hemisphere loud and clear."" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States will work to ""understand and mitigate"" Mexico's concerns. The Arizona law, she said, will be on the agenda when Mexican President Felipe Calderon visits Washington on May 19. One of the two lawsuits against SB1070 was filed Thursday by a police officer in Tucson, Arizona, who asked that local law enforcement be exempt from enforcing the measure. Officer Martin H. Escobar says in the federal suit that the law will ""seriously impede law enforcement investigations and facilitate the successful commission of crimes."" The National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders also filed a federal lawsuit Thursday. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Arizona and the National Immigration Law Center said Thursday they also plan to jointly file a lawsuit. Supporters of SB1070 cite high levels of illegal immigration and crimes committed by unauthorized immigrants as a reason for the new law. ""Border violence and crime due to illegal immigration are critically important issues to the people of our state,"" Brewer said at the bill signing. ""There is no higher priority than protecting the citizens of Arizona. We cannot sacrifice our safety to the murderous greed of the drug cartels. We cannot stand idly by as drop houses, kidnappings and violence compromise our quality of life."" But statistics from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency and the FBI indicate that both the number of illegal immigrants and violent crime have decreased in the state in recent years. According to FBI statistics, violent crimes in Arizona dropped by nearly 1,500 reported incidents between 2005 and 2008. Reported property crimes also fell during the same period, from about 287,000 reported incidents to 279,000. These decreases are accentuated by the fact that Arizona's population grew by 600,000 people between 2005 and 2008. According to the nonpartisan Immigration Policy Institute, proponents of the bill ""overlook two salient points: crime rates have already been falling in Arizona for years despite the presence of unauthorized immigrants, and a century's worth of research has demonstrated that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes or be behind bars than the native-born."" Federal officials estimate there are about 10.8 million illegal immigrants in the United States, of which about 6.6 million come from Mexico and 760,000 from the rest of Latin America. About 1 million come from Asia. Arizona, which is on the Mexican border, has about 460,000 undocumented immigrants, the federal government says. At least five other states, including California with 2.6 million, have more undocumented immigrants, the government says. The other states with more illegal immigrants than Arizona are Texas, Florida, New York and Georgia. A Pew Research Center survey late last year found that Americans believe Latinos are discriminated against more than any other major racial or ethnic group in American society. The Pew survey also indicated that about one-third of the nation's Latinos say they or someone they know has experienced discrimination. About 9 percent said they had been stopped by police or other authorities and asked about their immigration status in the year before the survey. Fifty-seven percent of those surveyed said they worried that they, a family member or a close friend could be deported.","NEW: Baseball players union, Urban League, fraternity voice disapproval of new law .

"(CNN) -- Robin Thicke isn't giving up on his marriage to Paula Patton. The couple, married since 2005, mutually decided to separate in February, and since then singer Thicke has been trying to win her back with his performances. It was speculated that Thicke might try such a gesture during his set at the Billboard Music Awards on Sunday. Sure enough, the R&B crooner appeared to make a not-so-veiled reference to his romantic life with a performance of ""Get Her Back"" during the ceremony. The new single has lyrics such as ""all I want to do is make it right"" and, ""I miss you, I miss you so much, baby/I just want you to come back home."" While Thicke never mentioned Patton by name during the performance, he did thank his ""wife"" for ""her love and support and for putting up with me all these years"" during an acceptance speech for Top R&B song. That also wouldn't be the first time Thicke's tried such a maneuver. Not long after the couple announced their separation,Thicke took the stage in Virginia and dedicated his hit ""Lost Without You"" to his wife. ""I'm trying to get my girl back,"" he told the crowd. ""She's a good woman."" According to People magazine, Thicke's taking his tour of love to Tuesday night's ""The Voice"" finale as well. Patton, for her part, has been somewhat more demure about the couple's status. When Vanity Fair wanted to know if her relationship with Thicke had reached its end, the actress vaguely replied, ""We've known each other since we were teenagers.

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- The heads of state of Russia, China and four Central Asian partner nations signed a statement Thursday opposing outside intervention in Syria and Iran. ""We believe any attempts to resolve the Iranian issue by force are unacceptable,"" the statement from the Shanghai Cooperation Organization read. ""Such attempts could lead to unpredictably serious consequences, which would threaten stability and security in the region and the entire world."" The heads of state of the other member nations, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, who attended the meeting hosted in Beijing, also signed the statement. On Syria, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization statement was less blunt, calling for ""dialogues that respect Syria's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity."" But on Wednesday, Russian president Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Hu Jintao had stronger words about Syria, once more presenting a united front on the crisis that stands in opposition to tough measures discussed by Western powers. ""Both sides firmly oppose any attempt to resolve the Syrian crisis through foreign military intervention as well as promoting forced 'regime change' at the U.N. Security Council and other venues,"" the two presidents said. Instead, they reiterated support for the mediation efforts of U.N. special envoy Kofi Annan and called on all parties in the conflict to stop violence and engage in dialogue. As permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, China and Russia have veto powers and are important players in the Syrian conflict, having vetoed draft resolutions that called for sanctions against the Syrian regime. In February, they vetoed a draft resolution calling on President Bashar al-Assad to step down, claiming it lacked balance. And last Friday, they both vetoed a U.N. resolution condemning last month's massacre in Houla. The vetoes drew criticism from the Syrian opposition and Western powers. Pressure has been mounting on China and Russia to use their influence on Syria and join efforts led by the United States to impose more sanctions on the al-Assad government and force it to step down. Last Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton urged China and Russia to be ""part of the solution in Syria"" by backing a political transition from the al-Assad regime. Based on the tone of the joint statement, observers say it seems unlikely that China and Russia are going to change their positions on Syria anytime soon.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was admitted to a hospital Tuesday after complaining to his doctor that he felt unwell, according to a spokesman for the Egyptian military. A military source said Mubarak's condition was stable, not critical, and that his wife and elder son were with him. Egyptian state television reported Mubarak suffered a heart attack during questioning over possible corruption charges. When contacted by CNN, however, the prosecutor's office denied any reports Mubarak had been questioned by authorities Tuesday. Egypt's health minister, Ashraf Hatem, later said that Mubarak's condition was stable enough to allow prosecutors to resume questioning at the hospital, according to the state-owned Al Ahram newspaper. The military announced early Wednesday that ""questioning of former President Mohamed Hosni Mubarak and his family has started today."" Mubarak proclaims his innocence . Mubarak was hospitalized at Sharm el-Sheikh International Hospital, state media reported. He and his family are believed to have been living on his estate in the Red Sea resort since February 11, when he stepped down and handed power to the military. The hospitalization comes two days after Egypt's chief prosecutor summoned Mubarak for questioning on corruption charges. Mubarak immediately decried the accusations, saying the probe is aimed at tarnishing his reputation and that of his family. In a brief audio message aired Sunday, Mubarak promised he and his family would account for everything they own. He said he agreed to allow the prosecutor to contact governments around the world to take ""proper legal steps"" to reveal whether he or his family own any property or real estate outside Egypt. Mubarak was brought to Cairo for questioning last month, and Egypt's attorney general issued an order to freeze the assets of Mubarak and his family, and prohibited them from leaving the country. Egyptian blogger's sentence is slammed . Mubarak had back surgery in Germany in 2004, and returned there in 2010 to have his gall bladder removed. He had largely withdrawn from public view in recent years, until this year's uprising prompted him to make televised speeches. Mubarak ruled Egypt for nearly three decades. His regime was toppled by a groundswell of popular protests that began January 25.

"(CNN) -- The United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency confirmed Monday that uranium enrichment has begun at a nuclear facility in northern Iran. On Sunday, a fundamentalist Iranian newspaper with ties to the nation's supreme leader said the enrichment had begun at the plant, which is ""immune to any military attack."" Security Clearance: Iran's underground program . ""Based on reports we received yesterday, Iran has begun uranium enrichment at the Fordo facility at the height of the threats by foreign enemies,"" the semi-official Kayhan newspaper said. ""The IAEA can confirm that Iran has started the production of uranium enriched up to 20%"" at Fordo, said International Atomic Energy Agency spokeswoman Gill Tudor. ""All nuclear material in the facility remains under the agency's containment and surveillance."" The Fordo nuclear enrichment plant is in the mountains of Qom province, where Iran says it has 3,000 centrifuges in operation. Another nuclear facility in Natanz is said to have 8,000 of the machines enriching uranium. Iran says there's a medical purpose behind the nuclear program. ""In order to provide medical assistance to 800,000 cancer patients, Iran needs to enrich uranium up to 20% to be able to feed Tehran's (research) reactor that produces the needed radioisotopes,"" the paper reported. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland said the confirmation that Iran is enriching uranium to ""a level that's inappropriate"" is ""obviously a problem."" ""We are closely monitoring their nuclear program in general, and this development, given their track record and what the IAEA inspectors have been able to report, it's not a surprise to us, what we're hearing."" She said the IAEA has been able to get into the Fordo facility ""on and off."" ""They've been able to get into some facilities at some times, but what they're finding, as they get in there, is that Iran is not complying with its obligations,"" she said. ""Iran plays this game with the inspectors. They let them go some places at some times when it seems to suit their purposes, but that doesn't change the fact that what the inspectors are now reporting is that they are taking the next step and escalating their violations of their own commitments."" The Iranian government announced in July that it was installing a new generation of centrifuges in its nuclear facilities. At the time, the French Foreign Ministry called the development ""a new wave of provocation"" that flouted U.N. resolutions. Enriched uranium at low concentrations can be used to fuel power plants, but in extremely high concentrations it can be used to produce a nuclear bomb. Uranium enriched to between 3% and 5% is necessary to make fuel for reactors. Weapons-grade uranium is enriched to about 90%. If Iran is enriching uranium to 20%, ""this is a further escalation of their ongoing violations with regard to their nuclear obligations, including the legally binding U.N. Security Council resolution,"" Nuland said. ""So, obviously, we call on Iran once again to suspend enrichment activities, cooperate fully with the IAEA and immediately comply with all Security Council and IAEA board of governors resolutions."" ""When you enrich to 20%, there is no possible reason for that, if you're talking about a peaceful program,"" she said. ""So it generally tends to indicate that you are enriching to a level that takes you to a different kind of nuclear program.""

""We are putting a great deal of pressure on Iran broadly because of its rogue behavior, if you will, the fact that it won't live up to its international obligations with regards to its nuclear program,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday. ""Those actions that we're taking in concert with our international partners have had a significant impact on Iran, on the Iranian economy."" He added, ""I believe it was just last week where the new sanctions, when they went into effect, had the impact of causing the Iranian currency to drop dramatically. So we work with our partners, as well as unilaterally, to increase that pressure."" Iran says it has a right to peaceful nuclear technology. The IAEA has said it cannot verify whether the intent of Tehran's nuclear program remains peaceful. Security Clearance: Iran's influence in South America . In Sunday's report, the fundamentalist paper appeared to thumb its nose at the West. ""Fordo is located deep inside mountains and due to its location is immune to any military attack,"" the article said. ""Locating the 20% enrichment facility at Fordo means that the military threat option against Iran's nuclear program will be removed from the table forever and the West will be forced to slowly realize the immunity of this program against any foreign threat.""

"(CNN) -- Once upon a time, the U.S. Census Bureau was a thriving hub of technological innovation. Before the 1890 census, for example, the bureau commissioned the first punch-card machine for data entry, enabling the bureau to tabulate its surveys of the national population in three years instead of seven. Then, in the 1940s and '50s, the Census funded what's been called the world's first commercial computer -- the Universal Automatic Computer, or UNIVAC 1 -- which counted electrical impulses using vacuum tubes. Today, however, critics see the census -- done every 10 years -- as a technological dinosaur. ""It's 2011. It's time the Census Bureau got away from the 1920 technology,"" said Jay Waite, a former deputy director of the agency who says he left over its failure to adopt new technologies in recent years. While countries like Canada, Brazil and Norway use smartphones, the internet and smartly connected government databases to get relatively fast and cheap counts of their populations, the United States' census is a pen-and-paper enterprise, with some census workers even walking door to door to collect results. ""Everybody else is moving that direction. They're doing it. Not just because they love technology but because they can do so many more things, and they can save a lot of money,"" Waite said. Meanwhile, the census' costs have been rising sharply, often doubling by the decade. The 2010 census cost an estimated $14 billion, or about $100 per household, which still was under its initial budget. In 2010 dollars, the 2000 census cost $8.2 billion, which was twice as expensive as the census taken before that, in 1990, when the cost was $4.1 billion. In 1970, the census cost $1 billion, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. The Census could knock up to 25 percent off of its budget if it adopted current technologies, including internet questionnaires, Waite said. But what would those technological advances look like, exactly? And would technology be able to solve the Census' cost problems while maintaining the accuracy of a survey that is supposed to reach every household in this 312 million-person nation? Here's a look at technologies that critics say the Census Bureau should consider. Internet instead of paper . Perhaps the most obvious way the U.S. Census Bureau lags technologically is that it collects data about the country by mailing surveys to peoples' homes. Shortcut: Send the forms over the internet. ""A lot of people now are much more accustomed to working with their computer and communicating online and via the internet,"" said Robert Goldenkoff, director of strategic issues at the Government Accountability Office, which has written reports on the Census' use of technology. ""And so people might be more willing to respond via the internet as opposed to filling out the form that they're mailed."" Canada tried a version of this for its last national census, in 2006, and it was considered a success. Nearly 19 percent of people responded online rather than on paper forms. To mitigate security concerns, the Canadians sent out paper notices with individual codes to people's homes. When respondents logged on to complete the survey, they entered that code to identify themselves as the person or people living in that household. Even proponents have concerns about security risks, however. ""It seems like anyone with half a brain would answer the census on the internet. It seems like low-hanging fruit,"" Waite said. ""But I ... was never able to be convinced that we could ensure the security and the integrity of the internet answers. When we take your census, we promise you that we will not let anybody but the census see your information."" The U.S. Census Bureau ran tests with internet surveys in 2003 and 2005, and neither showed significant cost savings, possibly because people then were less familiar with the internet than they are now, said Frank Vitrano, chief of the Decennial Management Division and an architect of the 2010 census. The bureau plans to use online forms in 2020, he said. ""Maybe we look old-fashioned in not having an internet response option, but I think if you look around the world at censuses that have used internet response options, a lot of times, they've done it not to look old-fashioned rather than for methodological reasons or cost reductions,"" he said. Kenneth Prewitt, former director of the Census Bureau and now a professor at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, said internet technology isn't a cure-all, however. ""It's irrational to think the internet would somehow solve"" all of the Census' cost problems, since people would still forget to respond, he said. Smartphones instead of pencils . The Census Bureau spends a large percentage of its budget following up with people who don't answer the questions on the first questionnaire it sends out to homes. The reason for this: The Census aims to be 100 percent accurate. Its figures even have political ramifications, as census data determine how many representatives states send to Congress. Consequently, Census workers are required to contact a person six times if he or she don't respond. This is called ""non-response follow-up"" in census-speak, and it's a fairly low-tech process, with workers going door to door searching for delinquents, interviewing them and scratching down the answers on paper. Those papers are then sorted by local Census workers, mailed to a processing center, scanned by a text-reading computer and entered into the system. The Census tried to speed up this process by sending workers to peoples' doors with portable computers -- kind of like tablets or smartphones, except the Census paid to have these gadgets developed because they didn't exist early in the 2000s, when the bureau was planning for 2010. Those ""handhelds,"" as the Census calls them, were built for the government by the Harris Corp. In pre-census tests, they didn't fare well, and the bureau decided to scrap them. Brazil, meanwhile, has pushed ahead of the U.S. with a smartphone census. And it did so after consulting with the U.S. Census Bureau in 2006 about its plans to use handheld devices, Vitrano said. Terri Ann Lowenthal, a consultant who works with businesses and other stakeholders on census issues, said the fact that the Census Bureau has to plan a decade in advance makes it difficult for it to get the latest technology. ""What is considered cutting-edge or emerging technology now could be obsolete or a lot better nine years from now,"" she said. Still, she said, the Census Bureau has been slow to adopt new technology and needs to work more closely with the tech industry to stay on top of trends. She recalls meetings in the early 2000s where Census workers talked about these failed portable computers. At the time, the internet had just become a major force in society, and the idea sounded ""space-age,"" she said. ""They're biting off more they can chew without really considering the steps it will take to get there,"" she said. Using available data . It's not as sexy as the internet and smartphones, but several critics of the census said the bureau should do more with data that already exist, rather than collecting all of the information on its own. The Internal Revenue Service, the Social Security Administration, Medicare and local school registries all collect data on the American public. With a little work, the critics said, that data could be standardized and used to supplement the census. This could mean better coordination among government agencies, which sometimes are forbidden by law to share data with each other. Or it could mean a national registry system, which would be updated with addresses and unemployment info continuously, instead of every 10 years. That's essentially the setup in Norway. ""If we had a national registration system in which everyone's mobile phone number and e-mail was part of that ID, boy, that would simplify things enormously,"" said Prewitt, the Columbia University professor. ""You could save a ton of money."" Getting something like that approved, however, would be a political nightmare because of concerns about privacy and government tracking, he said. ""People say 'Oh, my gosh, the government's going to come in the middle of the night and rush me off to prison,' "" he said. ""I think a rational conversation -- if one can have one in the United States Congress -- about a national registration system would be a very good thing."" The U.S. Census Bureau plans to research ways government databases could be used as a backup source of information, allowing workers to follow up with people who don't respond to the first census mailing two or three times instead of six, said the bureau's Vitrano. It's unlikely that a government registration number will be on the table for the 2020 census, he said. ""We think there are some opportunities there for cost savings,"" he said. Overall, Vitrano said, the census continues to work with new technologies and will push tech boundaries in the future. ""The research we do very often does lead to major innovation technologically, and I think it's very possible moving forward,"" he said.","Critics say the U.S. Census Bureau should adapt to the internet age .

"Buenos Aires (CNN) -- Argentina's president will undergo surgery next week after doctors diagnosed her with thyroid cancer, a spokesman said Tuesday. Routine medical tests last week uncovered papillary carcinoma in President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's thyroid gland, presidential spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro said. Medical exams indicate that the cancer has not spread to her lymph nodes or grown beyond the thyroid gland, he said. Doctors are scheduled to operate on Fernandez on January 4. She will take a medical leave and relinquish power to the South American nation's vice president from January 4-24, Scoccimarro said. Fernandez, 58, was sworn in for a second four-year term earlier this month after she won re-election with more than 54% of the vote. Fernandez sworn in for second term . She became Argentina's president in 2007. Her husband, Nestor Kirchner, was president from 2003-2007. He died in October 2010. Former Argentina President Kirchner dies suddenly . During Fernandez's presidency, Argentina's economy has enjoyed sustained growth of about 8% annually. Papillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer and has an excellent survival rate, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. More than 95% of adults with papillary thyroid carcinoma survive at least 10 years, according to a description on the library's website. Treatment includes surgery, radioactive iodine and medication, the library says. Possible complications in surgery can include damage to a nerve that controls the vocal cords or accidental removal of a gland that helps regulate blood calcium levels, according to the medicine library. Recently doctors have diagnosed several South American leaders with cancer. Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2010. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez announced that doctors had diagnosed him with cancer in June. He did not specify what kind of cancer he had, but after undergoing several rounds of chemotherapy, he said in October that he had been cured.

"(CNN) -- A 3.4-magnitude earthquake rumbled through northern California early Sunday, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The quake hit 5 miles southwest of Napa, the center of California's famed wine country. There are no reports of damage so far, the Napa County Sheriff's Office said. It comes a week after a 6.0-magnitude quake -- the strongest in northern California in a quarter of a century -- struck the same area on August 24. Last week's quake injured dozens, damaged historic buildings in downtown Napa and turned fireplaces into rubble. It also caused at least $1 billion in property damage in Napa and other communities.

"(CNN) -- When I was eight, my mother enrolled me in ballet classes. I loved it. Every Saturday we would trek across town to the building that housed the big bright room with the large mirrors. We would sit in the waiting room with the other girls my age, all of us in our pink leotards and soft pink satin shoes, with our moms at our side. Once inside, we would be taught the most delicate of moves from first position to fourth. They were gentle and fun but I was impatient. I wanted to stand on my toes. I wanted to do the pointes and twirl. That wasn't to be. After a mere three weeks, just three lessons, I told my mother I no longer wanted to continue. I told her it just wasn't for me. What I didn't tell her was that they weren't teaching us what I thought ballet was all about: dancing on your toes. At eight, I naively thought I could do it! My mother didn't force me but as I think back to that time, I wish she had. In some countries, ballet and the arts are part of the cultural DNA. In Russia, there is a great respect for the heritage and pride in what they do so well. The Bolshoi Ballet is considered the preeminent ballet company in the world and across Russia similar companies are religious about their art. In December, I was in St Petersburg where we hosted icon's ballet edition. Seeing the inner workings of a ballet company and being backstage was such an eye-opening experience. We were fortunate enough to be in on a rehearsal as Nacho Duato, the Mikhailovsky Theatre's new Artistic Director was choreographing his first dance with his three principal dancers. This was no ordinary rehearsal, and Duato's appointment is no ordinary promotion. The Spaniard is the first foreigner to lead a major dance company in Russia since Frenchman Marius Petipa over a century ago. There are politics even in this seemingly serene artistic world. National companies compete to get the best dancers and directors and there is pressure to deliver a style of ballet that will bring audiences to theaters. There is also  great debate over the merits of contemporary ballet versus the classics. Conventional wisdom says that the audience wants to see what they know: ""Swan Lake,"" ""The Nutcracker,"" ""La Sylphide"" are just a few examples of what usually sells. But there are artistic directors out there who feel the art of ballet is almost a living, breathing thing -- something that needs to evolve. Duato, is an avid supporter of contemporary ballet, so much so that he has made it is life's work. His difficulty before arriving in Russia was the reluctance of some companies to move beyond the classics and into a new world of contemporary choreographed ballet. With the Mikhailovsky, he told me he found a good balance. He said, ""Nowadays you can't have a relevant company in the world that doesn't do modern and classical at the same time ... It really is a pleasure to be in a place where ballet (has been) part of the cultural tradition for so long and at the same time they want to break through and do new things."" When I watch a ballerina move, I covet her grace, but perhaps more than anything, I am in awe of her strength. Every move has purpose and precision. Every muscle is alert and ready to perform on command. What look like light steps and twirls take body control akin to a boxer waiting to take his next punch. Interestingly, some boxers look to ballet as part of their training, especially when it comes to moving their feet. It takes extreme discipline to move so lightly and so purposefully. Discipline that makes each move look easy. A dancer on a stage is the culmination of years of discipline and passion for perfection; years in which each move and each sequence is like oxygen to the dancer ... something they can't or won't live without. Ballet is smooth and strong, pristine and powerful, romantic and riveting. Even if you're not an avid fan, I'm sure you'll develop at the very least, respect for this most graceful of art forms where dancers bend their bodies in moves that would be painful for mere mortals, but that they make look so easy.","In Russia there is a great respect for the heritage of ballet .

"Moscow (CNN) -- An anti-government protest in Moscow turned violent Sunday, with some demonstrators clashing with police after they veered off their agreed-upon route. More than 250 people were arrested, including leading opposition figure Boris Nemtsov, leftist radical group leader Sergei Udaltsov and popular blogger Alexei Navalny, Moscow police told CNN. They were among the thousands that descended on the Russian capital for the latest demonstration denouncing Vladimir Putin, the nation's current prime minister who was recently elected to a six-year term as president. He is set to be inaugurated Monday. As they marched, many chanted slogans such as ""Russia without Putin"" and ""Putin is a thief."" A large number of demonstrators did not follow the route to Bolotnaya Square that their leaders had agreed to with Moscow authorities, instead stopping in front of a line of police and refusing to move. Clashes broke out, with some protesters throwing various objects -- including sticks and at least one flare -- at police. Authorities responded by ""clubbing demonstrators"" who briefly broke through police lines, the state-run RIA-Novosti news agency reported. One of its correspondents saw ""a male protester out cold after clashing with officers,"" while another reported eight officers arresting one demonstrator ""for the apparent crime of wearing a Guy Fawkes' mask,"" the symbol of the vigilante hacking group Anonymous. Twenty officers were injured and three hospitalized in the clashes, according to RIA-Novosti, which added that those charged with assaulting police may face up to 10 years in prison if convicted. Itar-Tass, another official news agency, said four officers suffered cuts and wounds after having stones and bottles thrown at them and reporters. Police denied that they used tear gas as had been reported, according to RIA-Novosti. After the arrests, authorities slowly moved forward and moved everyone out of the area. Many protesters expressed disappointment that the event was not peaceful, with some saying they were angry at those who they felt had provoked a confrontation with police. Others who faced off with authorities voiced frustration that previous peaceful rallies had done little to forward their political aims. In March, Putin won the country's presidential election with nearly 65% of the vote, claiming victory amid allegations by independent polling monitors of widespread electoral violations. International observers said there was legitimate uncertainty about the vote, with chess champion-turned opposition activist Garry Kasparov accusing Putin's supporters of ""massive fraud."" Putin, the former KGB officer who has worked to both stabilize Russia's economy and curtail dissent, held the presidency for eight years before term limits forced him to step down in 2008. His election followed a series of anti-Kremlin protests in the wake of disputed parliamentary elections that took place in December.","Thousands protest against President-elect Vladimir Putin and his political allies .

"(CNN) -- Italy recorded the biggest Rugby World Cup win in their history on Tuesday as they crushed Russia 53-17 in Nelson, New Zealand. The Azzuri ran in nine tries against World Cup debutants Russia and now sit third on point difference in Pool C, level on five points with second-placed Australia. Italy flew out of the blocks at Trafalgar Park, securing a bonus point from four tries in just 22 minutes. Flanker Sergio Parisse ran over the first try before a brace from Giulio Toniolatti -- his first tries in international rugby -- and an additional score from center Tommaso Benvenuti gave a commanding lead. Italy, currently under the tutelage of former South Africa coach Nick Mallett, continued to press and were awarded a penalty try after 28 minutes when Russia were penalized for a succession of collapsed scrums. Alexander Yanyushkin made World Cup history for Russia with 33 minutes on the clock, the flyhalf going over to score the nation's first-ever try in the quadrennial tournament. But Russia's respite was short-lived as scrumhalf Edoardo Gori touched down Italy's sixth try of an action-packed first half with 37 minutes gone. Nikolay Nerush's Russia rallied in the second half as they attempted to stem the Italian tide, but Benvenuti continued the scoring as he went over to make the score 43-7 on 47 minutes. Wing Vladimir Ostrushko and center Alexey Makovetskiy did manage to score tries for Russia, either side of fullback Luke McLean's score for Italy. Substitute Alessandro Zanni completed the scoring with four minutes remaining, capitalizing on powerful scrum play from Italy to score his team's ninth try. The convincing win keeps alive Italy's hopes of reaching the quarterfinals for the first time, with their next match against the U.S. on September 27.

"(CNN) -- Sonic booms and at least one fireball in the sky were reported in Texas on Sunday, less than a week after two satellites collided in space and a day after the Federal Aviation Administration asked U.S. pilots to watch for ""falling space debris,"" authorities said.

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Russia is planning a ""comprehensive rearmament"" of its military, President Dmitry Medvedev said Tuesday. A Russian T-90 tank rolls through Red Square during 2008's Victory Day parade. The announcement comes amid concerns in Moscow over the performance of its forces during last year's invasion of Georgia, an expert on the Russian military told CNN. Christopher Langton, an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, said the campaign against the former Soviet republic had revealed significant weaknesses within Russia's armed forces. ""The Georgia thing was a wake-up call on a number of fronts,"" said Langton, a former British military and defense attache in Russia. ""Things they expected to perform well didn't -- communications, the air force. It took five days, which is quite a long time, to suppress another country's air defenses, quite a small country's."" Medvedev said the ""most important task is to re-equip the [Russian] Armed Forces with newest weapons system,"" in televised remarks to defense ministry officials. He said the process had already begun and would accelerate through 2011. Medvedev insisted that falling prices for oil and gas -- which contribute significantly to Moscow's budget -- would not force him to scale back on plans to modernize the military. The defense budget has ""virtually remained the same as was planned,"" Medvedev said, ""despite our current financial problems."" The country will aim for 70 percent of its weaponry to be ""modern"" by 2020, Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov said, according to RIA-Novosti, the state-run news agency. Russia invaded Georgia, to its south, in August of last year -- the first time Russian military forces had engaged in an offensive outside their borders since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The conflict strengthened the hand of Medvedev, who favors reform, against generals who oppose it, Langton, the military analyst, told CNN. ""It gave Medvedev a chance to reply to opponents in Ministry of Defense: 'We need much more mobile forces, better weaponry,'"" Langton said. But Langton pointed out that Russia has been talking about modernizing its army almost since the end of the Cold War nearly two decades ago. Former President Boris Yeltsin announced in the early 1990s that Russia would replace its conscript army with a professional force by 2010, Langton said -- a target it has come nowhere close to meeting. Modernization foundered on Russia's need to bring in money by exporting arms, rather than using the products of its military-industrial complex itself; opposition from entrenched interests in the Ministry of Defense, which opposed downsizing; and in the face of a national security strategy that focused on conflicts like the two Chechen wars. Former President Vladimir Putin staked his popularity in the late 1990s on winning the second war with the restive Chechnya, Langton observed. Medvedev, too, wants to promote pride in the country's military, the analyst said, but has a ""more nuanced approach"" than his predecessor, who remains influential as prime minister.

"(CNN) -- When the Arab League asked for U.N. Security Council endorsement of its call for a new government in Syria and sought the imposition of sanctions to pressure Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the Russians went toe-to-toe with the United States, publicly and behind closed doors. The Russians forced significant concessions in the wording and meaning of the resolution. They won the elimination of sanctions. And then they rejected the compromise they forged. Looks like, feels like, sounds like Cold War redux. But this assessment is overly simplified. So too are assertions that Russia cast its veto to protect a client state or as revenge against the West after being burned by the Libya resolutions. More precisely, the Russian tactics and veto are a rejection of the proactive, norm-enforcing Security Council that has emerged in the past decade. The Libyan case was the Russians' final straw for their claim that the Council had moved beyond the constraints that the charter places on U.N. infringement of national sovereignty, the use of force, and imposing economic sanctions. One of Moscow's major goals is to end the Council's regular use of sanctions as a leveraging tool or to isolate a state. The Russians have maintained that Council sanctions resolutions should be the maximum method of coercion. But the West has considered such sanctions as a springboard for the U.S. Treasury and EU banks to enforce far reaching asset freezes and banking restrictions. This week, as foreshadowed in their October veto, the Russians signaled the end of the U.N. sanctions era. The significance of this action cannot be overstated. Beginning with the sanctions against Iraq in August 1990, the Security Council has imposed sanctions in 20 cases and placed peacekeeping missions in dangerous war zones 19 times. Such proactive council legislation has been successful in de-funding al-Qaeda, stifling murderous militias in Africa, slowing nuclear proliferation and protecting innocent civilians from slaughter. Now the Russians have taken the teeth out of the tiger that was the Security Council. Understanding China's negative vote also requires a wider view. Beijing has only exercised its Security Council veto when Russia has vetoed. Never in council history has China been the lone ""nay."" Reports had been circulating in council corridors hinting that the Chinese were leaning toward abstaining on the Arab League resolution. But to judge their veto as Cold War solidarity also is too simplistic. China's view of Security Council sanctions has moved from disrespect to outright disdain. Its undermining of sanctions began as the investigative Panels of Experts -- created by the council to monitor sanctions violations in African conflicts -- discovered increasing amounts of Chinese small arms in Sudan, Somalia and Eritrea, despite U.N. arms embargoes. The Chinese have worked especially hard to hide and then to discredit the reports of the Panel of Experts created in Security Council resolution 1874, which monitors sanctions on North Korea. Breaking with the established transparency practice -- that U.N. Panel Reports are released on the sanctions committee's website -- the Chinese blocked release of the panel's 2011 report, even though the document was leaked and had appeared for months on global websites. Re-enter the Russians, who reacted the same way to the first report of the Iran Sanctions Panel of Experts delivered to the council in May 2011, by blocking its publishing. This created a perfect storm for undermining the effectiveness of the U.N. sanctions championed by the West. In the Security Council Sanctions Committees, the Chinese allied with Russian condemnation of the Iran Panel report and blocked its publication. In turn, Russia supported the Chinese critique of the North Korean panel report. On the face of it, hardball global politics in the Security Council provides a plausible explanation for the Russian-led veto of the Syria resolution. But the reasons underpinning the Moscow-Beijing veto are more far-reaching than that. Their actions seek to roll back advances the Security Council has made in employing various methods, especially economic sanctions, that have been especially successful in achieving the charter's dual mandate to sustain peace and security and to protect human rights. This is not the Cold War politics of the Security Council revisited -- it is much more serious than that. It is kneecapping the council after two decades of reasonable success.

"(CNN) -- After an apparent attempted military coup on Saturday, the people of the African nation of Lesotho are doing their best to return to every day life. According to the South African Department of International Relations, Prime Minister Thomas Thabane has been forced into hiding because of the unfolding security situation and out of fear for his life. Thabane became Prime Minister in 2012 and the next elections are due in 2017. During an interview that aired Saturday with South African broadcaster eNCA, he told the broadcaster he would not resign his position. Lesotho has been praised for its coalition government and a peaceful handover of power in 2012. But over the past few months, its growing instability had been a cause for alarm in the international community. The whereabouts of the deputy prime minister, Mothetjoa Metsing, are also unknown. He has not officially taken power -- although it would be constitutional for him to do so, since the Prime Minister is not fulfilling his duties. Sometimes referred to as the ""Kingdom of the Sky,"" Lesotho is completely landlocked by South Africa and is the only country in the world where all of the land lies above 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) in elevation. It has a predominantly Christian population of nearly 2 million people and covers an area slightly smaller than the U.S. state of Maryland, according to the World Factbook. It has been independent from the United Kingdom since 1966 but continues on as a member of the 53-nation Commonwealth. Residents return to normal . After Saturday's unrest, Maseru, the nation's capital, was calm. Despite the early-morning chaos and confusion, as all radio stations were temporarily muzzled, by afternoon most residents had returned to their normal Saturday activities. Since Friday was payday, many people withdrew cash from the ATMs, paid utility bills and shopped for groceries. At one main supermarket, one woman wondered aloud, ""Who knows what may happen tomorrow or Monday?"" On the streets, thousands milled about. Cows grazed by the side of the road. A trio of buddies lounged in wheelbarrows, soaking in the winter sun. Older women shuffled along the sidewalk, bundled in blankets. And amid the traffic, a wedding caravan honked, as the bride stuck her head out the window, ululating. No signs of the military were anywhere to be seen. Nereah Lebona owns a small beauty salon. She says she heard shooting around 4 in the morning, as she lives near police headquarters, where the main standoff occurred. But that didn't keep her from beautifying clients hours later. ""I was worried, until the radio came back on and told us what had happened,"" said Lebona, 36, smiling. ""But how else do I earn money if I don't go to work?"" A stone's throw away was more evidence that locals were carrying on as if nothing had happened and life had already returned to normal: a Lesotho Premier League soccer match. One of the teams was that of the Lesotho military. Among the hundreds of spectators, one man named Thabo giddily noted, ""The same soldiers who were shooting this morning are now playing football!"" This tiny mountain kingdom has been faced with many tall challenges. Lesotho has the world's second-highest rate of HIV infection -- 23% -- and a 40% malnutrition rate for children younger than 5. The country is also known for its ""herd boys,"" children as young as 5 who tend flocks of cattle in remote locations and often miss out on education. Britain's Prince Harry established a charity, Sentebale, to help the country meet educational challenges. But residents in Maseru are prepared for more uncertainty -- some fearing that an opposition demonstration planned for Monday could turn violent. Officials urge peace . Thabane told eNCA the Lesotho government is seeking the assistance of the South African government and other neighboring states. Clayson Monyela, a spokesman from the Department of International Relations of South Africa, said the government has no immediate plans to send troops into Lesotho, but the South African government is closely monitoring the situation and will continue to consult with Southern African Development Community countries and the African Union Commission. ""We can't have coups d'etat in 2014. If there are political problems people must sit (down) and talk,"" said Monyela. Monyela added that the Lesotho military's actions ""bear the hallmarks of a coup d'etat."" Kamalesh Sharma, secretary-general of the Commonwealth of Nations, condemned the reported coup attempt and urged the military in Lesotho to respect civilian authority, constitutional order and the rule of law. In a written statement, Sharma called for respect and urged all parties to ""refrain from violence and work together towards a peaceful and lasting resolution."" ""There is zero tolerance in the Commonwealth of any unconstitutional overthrow of an elected government,"" the statement read. ""Democracy and the rule of law are central tenets of our association ... and any action to subvert constitutional civilian rule is unacceptable."" Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, chairwoman of the African Union Commission, echoed this sentiment in a written statement, saying that the AU ""will not tolerate any seizure of power by illegal means"" and giving ""full support"" to the SADC in addressing the challenges facing Lesotho. Jen Psaki, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said the United States ""is deeply concerned by clashes between security forces today in Lesotho."" Psaki called upon all parties to ""remain committed to a peaceful political dialogue and to follow democratic processes"" in order to resolve the conflict. CNN's Nana Karikari-apau, Joshua Berlinger and Kay Guerrero reported from Atlanta. Michael J. Jordan reported from Lesotho.","NEW: Lesotho PM is in hiding out of fear for his life, according to a South African official .

"(CNN) -- Two rescued motorists were ""absolutely horrified,"" after a wall of icy water trapped them and several others in suburban Washington on Tuesday morning. Motorists climb into a rescue basket lowered by a helicopter. A woman trapped in a black SUV scrawled her husband's phone number on a piece of paper and flashed it to rescuers and reporters in the hopes that one of them would contact her husband. Sarah Lee, a reporter with CNN affiliate WJLA-TV, called to assure the woman's husband that ""several highly skilled swift water rescue personnel"" were working to save his wife. The woman and another passenger in the car were placed in a rescue boat, but were ""absolutely horrified, gripping onto the railings in the boat for their safety,"" said Lee. A massive water main break in Cabin John, Maryland, near the communities of Potomac and Bethesda, unleashed the flood during rush-hour Tuesday morning. The water main, 66 inches in diameter, unleashed the wall of water just before 8 a.m. that, at its height, was four feet high and 60 to 70 feet wide, Montgomery County police said. ""I knew that the cars were unstable just by the amount of water that was rushing by,"" said Jim MacKay, a Maryland State Police civilian helicopter pilot who flew to the scene from Andrews Air Force Base. MacKay, maneuvered his helicopter around tree limbs and power lines to hoist people to safety. The water's temperature made the situation even more dire, according to MacKay. Temperatures in the area dropped to nearly 18 degrees. ""The water had gotten into the car, so these people were at risk of hypothermia,"" he said. ""They were soaking wet."" Emergency crews rescued nine people, including one child, spokesman Pete Piringer of the Montgomery County Fire Department told CNN. Several others escaped on their own. Everyone was rescued by about 11 a.m. Of the five people hurt, none had life-threatening injuries, but several endured harrowing moments of uncertainty. ""Water was going over my car, and I was actually scared that water will draw us away somewhere because it was very strong water,"" Maria Stosse told CNN affiliate WJLA. ""All of a sudden just a gush of water came along with boulders and parts of trees,"" a woman told reporters. ""I tried to turn to get out of it [but] I couldn't. My car just got blocked in.""  Dramatic rescues by firefighters and emergency crews were broadcast nationwide on live television.  Watch the daring rescues » . A helicopter crew maneuvered a dangling metal basket to the passenger door of one vehicle where a child and one more person climbed in and were whisked to safety. The Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission was working Tuesday afternoon to isolate the break. A commission source told CNN that the valve at the source of the break was under water. As a result, workers were trying to turn off the water at a different point in the line. Once the water is turned off, crews will need another four hours to repressurize the county's water system, the commission said.","NEW: ""A gush of water came along with boulders and parts of trees,"" woman says .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- TED started as an experiment in convergence and somehow, miraculously, has morphed into a source of fascination, inspiration and learning for millions of curious souls all over the world. I showed up at TED for the first time 11 years ago and was exhilarated to find myself among people turned on by cool ideas. Geeks, designers, entrepreneurs, scientists, global activists -- viewed one way, they couldn't have been more different. But everyone was curious; everyone wanted to dig below the surface and have a real conversation about stuff that mattered. I fell in love with the event so badly that within a year, I'd set my heart on acquiring it. It was the kind of thing you could devote a life to. Through a complicated series of events, I was able to do this in 2001 and transfer it into a not-for-profit foundation with the mission ""ideas worth spreading."" That's made it natural for TED to gradually transition from being an exclusive club to a global community that anyone can participate in. The key step was our decision three years ago to start posting the conference talks online for anyone to see for free. Far from robbing the conference of its crown jewels, the move has been transformative, both for TED and for some of the speakers who have achieved an unexpected new form of celebrity. With audiences in the millions, they are helping redefine what it is to be a great teacher. It is thrilling to imagine them delivering insight and inspiration to knowledge-seekers old and young, rich and poor, in every corner of the planet. TED was founded in 1984 by information architect Richard Saul Wurman and his partners. They saw that the industries of Technology, Entertainment and Design -- the T, E and D of TED -- were converging and that an event covering all three could be uniquely interesting. So it turned out. The first TED showcased the brand-new Apple Macintosh and strange round silver shiny discs, the first CDs. The program generated huge excitement, but it was a commercial failure, Five years later, Wurman tried again, and since then it's been held annually in California, with a growing number of spin-off events in other locations. But a strange thing happened over the years. The content of the conference became ever broader, incorporating scientists, business leaders, novelists, social entrepreneurs and movers and shakers of all stripes. We now seek out literally anyone who is remarkable from any discipline, provided they can find a way of powerfully sharing their passion with a general audience. Here's why this works. Our world has gotten more complicated than ever. And most issues simply cannot be understood by looking at them through a single lens. In the world's race to specialize, we forgot that actually all knowledge is connected. Take the current economic crisis. The bankers and economists and politicians are largely stumped. To fight our way through this may well require ideas from much wider sources -- perhaps from systems architects and evolutionary psychologists, or from researchers dreaming up new energy sources or philosophers or activists questioning our basic priorities. Policies and politicians come and go, but great ideas last forever. And we live in an age where they can spread faster than ever. But there's something else strange about TED. It turns out that if you spend a few days opening yourself to brilliance from multiple sources, not just intellectual but also aesthetic, something remarkable happens. You end up getting seized by a sense of possibility, excitement -- inspiration, even. Since taking over at TED, I've been trying to figure out what that means and what can be done with it. One of our attempted answers is the TED Prize. Each year, we grant this award to three individuals with world-changing potential. They get $100,000 ... but more important, they are granted a wish under the following terms: ""No restrictions. Think big. Be creative."" At TED, they reveal their wishes to an audience ready to be inspired. This has led to a series of thrilling collaborative projects (they're documented at tedprize.org). This year has seen another surprising development in which tens of thousands of people around the world have gathered in more than 300 self-organized TED-like events. We call this program TEDx (see ted.com/tedx) . TEDx events have been held in 50 countries, in schools, companies, campuses and theaters. They range in scale from 1,200 college kids in Los Angeles, California, to a tiny battered church in the middle of Africa's largest slum. The passion being put into these events is astonishing and proves a global interest in this new way of sharing knowledge and reawakening wonder. How big could this get? Well, it depends on how many people are out there with a passion to learn and a willingness to help shape a better future. Certainly, CNN's partnership is a big step forward for us, giving TED exposure to a vast global audience hungry for knowledge that matters. TEDTalks aren't usually about the story of the day. But the ideas they communicate will help shape the stories of tomorrow. Welcome to TED. Watch with an open mind ... and let your curiosity take you on a thrilling journey of discovery!

"Moscow (CNN) -- Moscow is a city defined by its scale. ""Everything is massive, like the 10-lane roads that run through the city. The buildings are vast and monumental, as befits the capital of the world's biggest country,"" said Matthew Chance, a CNN senior international correspondent who has lived in Moscow for six years. Russia is about 1.8 times the size of the United States and more than 10 million people call Moscow home, according to the CIA World Factbook. It's a huge city with price tags to match. Moscow is regularly ranked among the world's most expensive cities. ""That means limos and bling everywhere,"" Chance said. CNN.com asked Chance to share some of his favorite spots: . Where can you get the best view of the city? From Sparrow Hills, which overlook the river and the cityscape below. There are some beautiful walks through the park there, and it's a handy place to pick up a Soviet-era souvenir from the stalls that line the road. Insider Trip Tips: Berlin . What's the biggest misconception about the city? That it is ugly. It's actually quite beautiful in many parts, especially at night when it is lit up. Which restaurant would you take your loved one to for an anniversary or other special occasion? Depends on if you want to be flashy or subdued. Galleria (located on Petrovka Ulitsa) would be one flash option, though in Moscow there are many others. On the more romantic side, Georgian food at Tiflis (on Ostozhenka Ulitsa) could work for you. What is your favorite neighborhood? Patriarch's Ponds is my favorite. It's got the feel of a village and is crammed with interesting little shops and cafes, including a favorite bar (Klava) and excellent bakery (Volkonsky). It also has a beautiful pond, which is relaxing to stroll around in summer. It becomes an ice rink in winter. Where do you go to relax? Sanduny Banya, the ultimate traditional Russian sauna. You can get rubbed down with a hard brush, beaten with birch branches or simply bask in the searing heat of the steam. When it all gets too much, plunge into the ice cold pool, then retire to eat shrimps and drink hot tea with lemon and honey. I'm feeling relaxed just (talking) about it. Insider Trip Tips: Seattle . What essential thing should visitors see/experience if they only have a few hours? If you want to see something iconic, then you have to go to Red Square to see St Basil's Cathedral (see above). Take a photo. Then go to Banya. How do tourists stick out, and what's the best way to blend in? They stick out by not speaking Russian, or by speaking Russian badly. What's the biggest ""tourist trap""? Is there one that's actually worth seeing? Lenin's Tomb on Red Square, ballet at the Bolshoi Theatre, the Kremlin Armory. All touristy, all worth seeing. Where was your most memorable meal? There's a surprisingly excellent Indian restaurant, Darbar, on the top floor of the Hotel Sputnik on Leninsky Prospect. It has Indian staff, who all speak English, and fabulous views over city. Insider Trip Tips: Wolf Blitzer's Washington . Where's your favorite place to spend a night out of town? A friend's dacha, or country house, perhaps. But if you want to spend a night away from Moscow, hop on the new bullet train and head to St. Petersburg. Are there local specialty dishes or drinks that visitors must try? Vodka and caviar, with blinis (pancakes) and sour cream. What is a good local souvenir? A furry hat, with ear flaps. Have you been to Moscow? Share your tips in the comments section below.","More than 10 million people call Moscow home .

"(CNN) -- Islamist rebels dressed in government military uniforms approached the gate of a high security prison in Mogadishu on Sunday, set off a car bomb and fired their way into the building, eyewitness Farah Mohammed told CNN. They were Al-Shabaab fighters, and security guards at the prison ""foiled the attack"" and killed seven of the rebels, Somalia's Information Minister H.E. Mustafa Duhulow said in a statement. ""The attackers exchanged heavy gunfire with prison guards after detonating a car bomb at the main gate,"" Mohamed said. ""A plume of dark smoke could be seen rising from the attacked complex."" During the assault on the National Intelligence and Security Agency prison three security guards and two civilians were also killed, 15 others were injured, Security Ministry spokesman Mohamed Yusuf told CNN. The attackers tried to free their fellow Al-Shaabab members held at the prison, who were sentenced to death by a Somali military court tribunal, said police Officer Abdifarah Ali. ""We were behind today's raid on NISA prison in Mogadishu,"" Al-Shabaab spokesman Sheikh Abdiaziz Abu Musab said on pro-militant radio station Al-Andalus. ""Our Mujahideen forces stormed the complex and then sprayed the prison guards with bullets and bombs,"" he said. The government praised the security forces, saying it shows that Somalia has improved security. ""These terrorists groups are against the security improvements we are currently experiencing here in Mogadishu,"" Information Minister H.E. Mustafa Duhulow said in a statement. ""We say to them that these foiled attacks strengthen our forces and prove their bravery to the people of Somalia,"" he said. The NISA prison is underground and is close to the Somali presidential palace in Mogadishu. Hundreds of inmates, mostly Al-Shabaab members, are being held there. Al-Shabaab is an al Qaeda-linked militant group seeking to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. The group claimed responsibility for the deadly attack at a Kenyan mall last year and is believed to be responsible for attacks in Somalia that have killed international aid workers, journalists, civilian leaders and African Union peacekeepers. CNN's Nana Karikari-apau, and Kay Guerrero contributed to this story.","Al-Shabaab rebels try to storm a prison in Mogadishu .

"(CNN) -- His long hair has been shaved off, he has to wear a Marine's uniform and is given orders like a soldier, but Udi Segal is not in the military -- he has in fact refused to join the Israel Defense Forces. He may have refused to join then, but he's still forced to look like a soldier in prison. The 19-year-old has been in prison for 20 days. He's a ""refuser"" -- the name given to conscientious objectors who refuse to join the Israeli military on political and ethical grounds. We drove from Jerusalem to Carmel Prison, near Altit, at 6 a.m. -- Udi was due to be released for the weekend and we were meeting his parents at the gates as they were expecting his release anytime between 8 and 9:30 a.m. As we wait, I witness an impatient mother anxious to see her son, pacing. He is her ""baby,"" the youngest of three boys. But this mother has found herself at the heart of a divide in Israeli thinking, a society sometimes split between patriotic, isolationist thought and inclusion. Hevda Livnat has two other sons serving in the military, one of whom is in Operation Protective Edge in Gaza. The boys in the military didn't want to appear on camera or talk to us. When I ask Hevda about her feelings about the differences amid her family, she shrugs and says simply, as only a mother can: ""They're all my boys."" His father Davidi Segal at first seems uncomfortable with not only our presence, but his son's choices. But that all slipped away pretty fast when they saw Udi. The teenager is questioned before release, and finally emerges at 10:30 a.m. The father hugs him and cheers. They are ""happy to see his smile"" says Udi's mother and ""relieved"" says his father. But he's only out for the weekend and must return -- it's only then he'll be told how long he's back in for -- possibly another 20 days. This process can go on for months. First stop for the teenager -- a plate of hummus -- and then time, to sit down with me to discuss his carefully considered political and ethical views. I learn that the family lives in a ""Kibbutz"" or Jewish commune in the north of Israel and Udi's views were formed at an early age in a joint Arab-Israeli (or Muslim-Jewish) school. ""I understood that Arabs can be my friends, Arabs are not at all my enemies, they are my neighbors."" Why not join the army for the sake of military service, I ask him. ""If I wouldn't be a fighter and I'd just sit in an office, someone else would fight, someone else will kill people, someone else will occupy and also I would occupy -- I will support a system that occupies."" But does Udi really think being a refuser can change anything? He is after all in a minority. ""I know my step won't stop the occupation but what I hope to do is that people will see I refuse and will think twice before they join the army; if they're now in the army they'll think twice before they're pushing the button and killing people in Gaza,"" he explains. At this point I ask him about his brother, who is in the IDF and has been serving in Gaza. ""There is debate ... but there is still brotherhood,"" he replies. Udi's mother has accepted her sons' choices. She hopes her sons in the military can be at peace with their actions but respects their choice to do their duty. And Udi's decision, she says, didn't come as a surprise, she has watched him develop his political thought. She says the family has learned from it. ""We need these people, as a mother of course I ask why my son, but we need these voices to be heard. We shouldn't be afraid. Nothing will happen to Israel if 400 people say we're not going to Gaza."" In fact she likes the idea of citizens challenging politicians. She tells me she doesn't want Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to feel too comfortable sitting in his seat of power while this conflict continues. In an interesting take Udi tells me, even as an Israeli citizen, he too feels ""occupied,"" a concept I hadn't considered. ""The basic freedom that people don't get in Gaza, also in West Bank, also here in Israel, is because of the occupation. Because of the occupation, I live in a military society, in a violent society, a chauvinistic society."" The Israel Defense Force wouldn't tell CNN how many teenagers are enlisted into military service every year for, they say, security reasons. Neither would they share the number of refusers. Udi's parents, Hevda and Davidi, both served in the military. While they're proud to have children making independent decisions, there is a mixture of confusion and concern amid their openness. His father, who at first I thought was against his son's decision, is not so much opposed to it, as concerned. He is not sure Udi understands the complex situation, which he says he hates. Neither side is right or entirely to blame, he explains: ""Hamas is wrong and Israel is no angel."" He however, sees a combined military and political solution to the situation. But he wants to be able to debate with his son who has ended the discussion and made up his mind. Udi's mother has accepted his path but is concerned his decision may have repercussions. Are you scared of the backlash? I ask Udi. ""I get messages in my Facebook and email -- that people want to kill me, I'm a traitor... But I'm fine, I'm not scared."" Udi is clear, he doesn't support Hamas -- he doesn't believe they're helping the Palestinian cause at all. They are also not helping their own people. But neither does he support Israel's response to Hamas's rockets. But what would he say to people who say he's not being patriotic or respectful of his country? He is forceful. Confident and without thinking twice responds. ""I don't want to respect my country, I don't want to be patriotic, I want to respect people, not countries."" Military service is compulsory by law in Israel. Men must serve three years; women must serve two. Everywhere we go in Israel we see teenagers in military fatigues carrying their guns, a badge of honor, a reminder this country considers itself under threat and has the right to self defense. To stand out from such a strong national narrative isn't easy. But Udi is clear, he's no hero, it's not about courage or even about him. ""This is also one of the problems that people look at me that I'm brave, [but] I don't want them to look at me that I'm brave, I want them to look at the occupation. The Israeli military points out that not all are conscientious objectors like Udi. But some Israeli teenagers do say no. Udi is not alone, he is one of 130 young Israelis who wrote to Netanyahu -- not only refusing to serve but criticizing Israeli politics, policy and accusing the state of war crimes -- an allegation the state rejects. Later in the evening, on his first of just two days out, he takes time to meet his friends ... and other refusers who have held a party for him. The group call themselves the ""Conscientious Objectors against the Occupation"" and operate through word of mouth and Facebook. They are Israeli boys and girls who feel their voice too should be heard. They posted their letter on Facebook and invite people to sign it. I meet several of them that evening who signed the letter to the PM. These are incredibly politicized young people who want to break free from the national narrative -- articulate teenage activists. Bar Levy, who is 16 and still at school, says: ""I don't agree with what the army does. I think it's immoral and it's only hurting us and the Palestinians."" Daniel Elsohn is an 18-year-old social volunteer for Windows for Peace. ""I think the army plays a big role in getting our society militarized and getting our society very much concentrated around violence and repression and it is not something I want to take part in."" he says. Danielle Yaor, aged 19, says: ""As a citizen ... I live because of the suffering of Palestinians and because of that I chose to be against the occupation."" Though not huge in number, their opinions and actions are adding to the debate inside Israel - a discourse these young Israelis hope will lead to a more open society. Yet the operations and conflict continue. Victoria Eastwood contributed to this report.","A ""refuser"" has decided against joining the Israeli military on political and ethical grounds .

"(CNN) -- Breathe in. Breathe out. Simple, right? The first thing anyone does in this world is take a breath of air -- it should be effortless. For me, and nearly 70,000 people across the world like me, it's not so easy. I have cystic fibrosis (CF) and I have never been able to take a full breath of air. Every day for 23 years, it has been a struggle to breathe. I often get asked what CF is, or what it is like to live with CF. There is no one true answer. The best I can come up with is, imagine living every single day with something like bronchitis, or, a little more simply put, imagine having to breathe through a straw all day, every day. The mucus that fills my lungs and traps some of the most deadly bacteria imaginable as a result of my genetic defect has always been inside me. So, how do I live with it? I never feel bad for myself. When it comes to living with a chronic illness, self-pity, in my opinion, is the root cause of failure. I was dealt a certain hand of cards at birth and I am making the very best of it. It's not anyone's fault I have CF. It isn't a curse. It isn't bad luck. It just happened. I have every reason in the world to stay in bed all day and feel sorry for myself, but I don't. I get up and carry out my day like most people. I graduated college in four years, have a job and take care of all of my responsibilities. I don't hold anything back. Between all the inhaled treatments, mucus clearing therapies and the 80 pills or so that I ingest every day, the amount of time I spend taking care of myself is the equivalent of a full time job ... and that's only when I am healthy. The physical treatments themselves may only take about two to three hours total, but every single decision I make throughout the day has some impact on my health, one way or another. Am I going out with my friends on a Friday night? Is it OK to skip a treatment because I am too tired? Can I go away for the weekend, or am I starting to feel sick? Questions like these constantly go through my head. As far as I am concerned, this is all just a part of my life. I don't know any other way. When it comes down to it, I don't have any complaints; I think I live a great life. I have the best friends I could ever ask for. I have an amazing sister. I had the best four years of my life at Boston College. I am able to work a few jobs and I was an athlete growing up. (I might still consider myself an athlete, but the jury is still out on that decision!) There is a difference between being alive, and truly living. In 70 years, when I am 93 years old, I want to be able to look back on my life and know that I have an enormous collection of unforgettable experiences. I think the experiences and memories we create for ourselves are what define our personalities. I want people to say, ""Wow. That guy Gunnar Esiason has lived a great life."" I realize I am still pretty young, but I like to think that I have a pretty good understanding about the value of life and how fragile it can be. I could be having the greatest day of my life one day, but the next I could be hunched over coughing up blood. It is just the reality of the disease I live with. Every day, good or bad, has shaped who I am. The bottom line, though, is that cystic fibrosis has taught me how to be resilient. I don't take no for an answer and I know I can be whatever I want to be. I was sort of born into a unique situation. Because my dad's a national figure and my parents' were willing to take on CF in a public way, I have been given the chance to make a difference. Some may call me the poster boy for cystic fibrosis, but I don't think anyone should have that title. We're all in this together. Every family that has to carry the CF burden is in this fight. All I want to do is give CF patients a voice, so that one day we aren't dealing with the pain that comes along with the disease. One day, it will be behind us. Breathe in. Breathe out. Earn the air.","An estimated 70,000 people worldwide have cystic fibrosis .

"(CNN) -- While he fell short of bluntly saying, ""I told you so,"" Alexei Miller, arguably Russia's most powerful energy executive, warned the West that it may not be able to count on Mideast and North African energy supplies as it once did. Coming from Miller, the chief of Russian energy giant Gazprom, it was a not-too-subtle nudge that global importers of energy, especially Europe, should invest more in Russian oil and gas capacity. ""The question about the reliability of gas deliveries from North Africa to Europe should be more critically examined than it is currently."" said Miller in comments to NTV, a Gazprom-owned Russian broadcaster. Gazprom told CNN its executives were not available to further clarify his comments. However, Gazprom has been one of many Russian energy companies trying to attract more foreign investment to further exploit its vast and proven oil and gas reserves. ""Perhaps Russia is trying to issue some friendly advice (to the West) that maybe it's time to diversify our sources of energy. It is good for Russia for it's certainly in a position to do more."" said Liam Halligan, chief economist of Prosperity Capital in London. According to U.S. government statistics, Russia is the world's largest oil producer and second-largest exporter after Saudi Arabia. But the timely, if opportunistic, warning darkened an already jittery mood among energy analysts as some now discussed the possibility of an oil ""superspike"" that could fuel a commodities crisis in the months to come. How high could oil go? While industry insiders agree a spike of $200 a barrel is unlikely, many are now unwilling to rule out that kind of a price range. Oil cartel OPEC has tried to calm concerns, saying spare capacity exists to soften the blow and moderate price spikes. But some now doubt the organization has a handle on spare capacity. ""There is growing concern in the market that there isn't the spare capacity in Saudi Arabia that the markets have been told there is,"" said Charles Robertson, chief economist at Renaissance Capital. ""The second problem is that the markets can't be as relaxed about the Middle East and North African now as they were even a week or two ago,"" he said. ""What matters about Libya is that you've seen a regime which has been stable for the better part of 30 years and is in danger of being overthrown. The assumption that we can assume stability in, say Saudi Arabia, or other countries around the Gulf, that assumption is now going to be doubted by the markets,"" Robertson said.","Head of energy giant Gazprom tells West that Mideast supplies may not be reliable .

"(CNN) -- Two pilgrims from Iran have contracted the H1N1 virus, according to reports from the country's official news agency. December 2008: A Saudi policeman directs pilgrims at Mount Arafat, southeast of holy city of Mecca. Every year about two million Muslims go on pilgrimage to Mecca -- the holiest place in Islam. As well as the annual Hajj pilgrimage, which all Muslims are required to make at least once if they can afford to, the faithful can also make a lesser pilgrimage to Mecca, known as umra, at any time of the year. Iran's official Fars news agency Wednesday reported that a 57-year-old woman and a 24-year-old man who had recently returned from a pilgrimage tested positive for the H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu. This brings Iran's tally to three cases. The latest cases highlight concerns that the Hajj pilgrimage will hasten the spread of swine flu. In June, host country Saudi Arabia held a workshop where health officials  recommended that pregnant women, children and elderly people with chronic illness should not attend the pilgrimage this November. In addition, officials are recommending that visitors to the country receive a seasonal flu vaccine at least two weeks before traveling to the holy places. Gregory Hartl, Team Leader for WHO's H1N1 Communications told CNN: ""We are distributing to all countries the advice that Saudi Arabia itself has put out for Hajj season."" Rates of infection in the Middle East, however, are still relatively low standing at just over 1100 cases, with no reported deaths. And in Saudi Arabia the total number of reported infections currently stands at just 114. On Monday, the country shut an international school after 20 students were diagnosed with the Influenza A(H1N1) virus. Saudi Arabia is also keen to reiterate general hygiene advice including cough and sneeze etiquette (covering the nose and mouth), use of antiseptic hand gels and frequent hand washing with soap and water. The latest World Health Organization figures estimate that the worldwide infection rate is approaching 100,000 with 429 recorded deaths. But concerns must persist about countries with large Muslim populations and higher levels of swine flu infection. The U.S., for example, tops WHO's swine flu table with more than 37,000 reported cases. The Web site for the Saudi Arabian Embassy in the U.S. states that nearly 12,000 visas were issued for Hajj in 2008. In the UK, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Web site report that around 25,000 British Muslims attend Hajj every year. The UK is the third in WHO's swine flu table with more than 9000 reported cases to date. In light of this, the Muslim Council for Britain told CNN that they will be publishing advice to British Muslims wanting to travel to Hajj shortly. Fears about the spread of swine flu during Hajj extend across the whole Middle East region and governments have been quick to publish guidance. Bahrain and Oman have both issued similar advice to Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates are set to launch a swine flu awareness campaign in the run up to Hajj. Saudi Arabia has already put in place quarantine facilities at major airports in the country so that pilgrims suspected of carrying swine flu can be safely isolated.","Saudi authorities concerned 2009 Hajj season will facilitate swine flu spread .

"(CNN) -- With snow in the forecast almost daily, municipalities in much of the country have been sprinkling roads and sidewalks with salt for safety. But this brutal winter has left some cities struggling to get stockpiles of salt to hard-hit areas, authorities said. Others have turned to alternatives such as cheese brine to keep roads safe -- despite the lingering odor. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that the long, snowy winter had left New York City and Long Island with salt shortages, prompting the state Department of Transportation to move 3,500 tons of road salt to those areas from state stockpiles, according to a statement. The state is also mixing sand with salt to stretch resources, according to a Cuomo spokesman. While salt is essential to making the roads safer, New Yorkers should take news of shortages with a grain of, well, salt because alternatives are used throughout the country. Sometimes the alternatives are cheaper than traditional salt. In Polk County, Wisconsin, for instance, cheese brine from factories is used for snow and ice control, according to Michael Sproul, program manager at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. ""Cheese brine is not an alternative to salt, it's just a cheaper version,"" he said, adding that it's mixed with salt to conserve supplies. ""In Wisconsin, it's a waste product. For us, it can be used on the roads. Someone can give it to us. We ask them to filter and deliver it and we use it ... We're doing them a favor. It's just another material that we can use with salt to treat the snow and ice that's supposed to be close to free. The brine is effective because it works at a lower temperature than normal salt, according to Emil Norby, technical support manager at the Polk County Highway Department. In Bergen County, New Jersey, officials in the past have used a mixture of salt and water that resembles pickle juice and costs significantly less than salt, former county Public Works Director Joe Crifasi told CNN affiliate WCBS in 2011, which was also an exceptionally snowy winter. Other alternatives to salt have included liquid from byproducts, including beer waste and beet juice, according to a study by the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, a New York state-based environmental group. Some communities are dealing with high costs for both salt and overtime for plow drivers. In Oak Park, Illinois, salt is three times the normal price because of high demand this winter, and overtime for plow workers is adding up. CNN's Ted Rowlands contributed to this report.","Brutal winter has left some cities struggling to get stockpiles of salt for roads and sidewalks .

"(Beijing, China) (CNN) -- The mood at the 120th anniversary of Chairman Mao Zedong's birthday is relatively muted, by Chinese standards. No spectacular fireworks, no big parades, as would have been expected during Mao's three-decade rule. But the Chinese remembered Mao properly. In Beijing, a big crowd solemnly gathered in the marble and granite mausoleum containing Mao's embalmed body. Chinese president and Communist party chief Xi Jinping attended the 9 a.m. ceremony along with China's top leaders. More elaborate rituals were conducted in Mao's hometown of Hunan province. ""There have been big meetings and academic symposiums discussing Chairman Mao's life and achievements,"" said a retired cadre in Hunan, who declined to be identified because he is not authorized to talk to the media. ""In (Mao's birthplace) Shaoshan, they reopened the just refurbished Chairman Mao museum. Tourists from all over China are also flocking in to visit his birthplace. Chairman Mao's relatives are also in Shaoshan to take part."" Many Chinese still admire Mao and most of his policies. They are considered ""leftists"" or conservatives because they oppose liberal-thinkers and reformists who in China are deemed rightists. Xiong Bao, 25, believes the celebration is necessary. ""As the founding father, I think he deserves this, but I don't think it's necessary to make it too big,"" he said. ""Nowadays, the whole nation is calling for thrift, so it's fine as long as it's low key."" Even though he was born after Mao's death, Xiong says he has read Mao's writings extensively. ""I respect his thought. It was his advanced thoughts that enabled the Chinese to win the revolution,"" he said. For decades, Mao had been revered as the infallible ""Great Helmsman"" and ""Great Leader."" But Mao's mystique had been fading since his death in September 1976 at the age of 82. Over the years, through official pronouncements, books, and media accounts, Mao's human frailties and mistakes have been pointed out, casting aside the nurtured belief of his infallibility. Many books have been published, in and out of China, criticizing Mao and his policies. Officially, Mao is considered 70% correct and 30% wrong. ""He is credited for the Liberation (in 1949) and is blamed for the mistakes of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution,"" said the retired cadre. Yi Shunhan, 38, is not impressed with the Mao anniversary. ""I don't really care about it. It doesn't have much impact in my life. I personally think his faults outweigh his achievements,"" he said, citing the Cultural Revolution, famine, and lag in technology development as Mao's personal failures. ""The Great Leap Forward was one of his biggest failures,"" he added. ""How many people died of that?"" The Great Leap Forward, launched by Mao in 1958, was intended to skip several stages in building a new communist China and catch up with Britain's economy in 15 years. But it led to economic recession, poor harvests and widespread famine in which tens of millions of people died. The Mao-initiated Cultural Revolution swept China from 1966-76, pushing ""class struggle"" to get rid of old institutions and Mao's political enemies. The political movement careened out of control, led to massive political purges, deaths and destruction. Chinese leaders who took power after Mao have reversed many of his policies. Instead of pursuing ""class struggle,"" they are now pushing for modernization, reform and opening up. Mao's pedestal may have been lowered. His once ubiquitous visage is now relegated as just one of the iconic images on T-shirts and posters, along with those of Che Guevarra, Hello Kitty and the Giant Panda. Still, The Global Times, an official state newspaper, called attempts to negate Mao as ""childish wishful thinking,"" citing that Chinese people today still live under the great impact of Mao. Mao's fading image endures, because it remains a part of the glue that holds the Communist nation together. ""Hunan people still admire and respect Chairman Mao,"" said the retired cadre from Mao's birthplace. Bai Yan, 28, sees a need to remember Mao. ""It's an opportunity to learn about him and Chinese history. It's an opportunity for young people to learn about what took place in China in the past."" CNN's Feng Ke contributed to this story.","Mao Zedong's 120th anniversary in China is more muted .

"(CNN) -- Andrew Ferguson makes the college admissions process feel a lot like an M. Night Shyamalan movie: Plenty of drama and tension. Maybe a little terror. And plot twists that will leave parents saying, ""I did not see that coming."" Ferguson's new book, ""Crazy U: One Dad's Crash Course Into Getting His Kid Into College"" is part comic memoir and part parental prep guide. Ferguson, a senior editor at The Weekly Standard, jokes that the book is primer on how to prevent a murder. ""This isn't a book about how to get your kid into college,"" he said. ""It's about how to survive getting your kid into college."" But with all the sage advice on navigating the potholes and mazes of college admissions, ""Crazy U"" also is a poignant read about parents helping their beloved son leave home and find success at a decent school. Ferguson chatted with CNN and the following is an edited transcript: . CNN: A lot of the application process seems to be about mom and dad and not about the student. Ferguson: It's sort of parenthood concentrated. It's all of the ironies of parenthood put together because, of course, the job of a parent is to teach the people that you can't live without, to live without you. You sort of fulfill yourself by denying yourself. That's what goes on in this college admissions process. You're trying to help the kid leave you. There are some parents who think that's great, but most of the parents I know feel pretty torn about that. On one hand I'm writing about the struggles my son had getting through the process. On the other, I'm writing about the struggles my wife and I had. Two sides of the same coin. CNN: How much of the research and application process should be the student's and how much should be the parents? Ferguson: Every parent and child are going to have to determine that for themselves. Even against your best intentions, the process has a way of sucking you in. There are little trapdoors built into the process that demand the parent get involved. My son assumed the posture of one of those bodies floating face-down in that scene of ""Titanic."" I think that was a reaction to my over-aggressiveness. But I knew I was going to have to poke him once in a while. CNN: Does he understand now why you did what you did? Ferguson: I really don't know. I do know that he's extremely happy where he is and he's thriving. How much of that entails gratitude to his mother and father is not clear. He's read the book and he hasn't tried to murder me or anything, so I assume it wasn't entirely offensive to him. I've often thought the key to the whole process is how to keep your kid from murdering you, and how to keep from murdering your kid. If you can get through this thing without homicide, I think that's a victory in itself. CNN: You write that for every piece of advice you get, there's another piece of advice to counter it. Ferguson: That's how everybody ends up. They may not admit it, but that's what everybody does. I talk about this law of constant contradiction which seems as ironclad as anything Newton or Einstein came up with. That's partly because there's so much advice out there. It's almost inevitable that someone will say, ""Proofread your application."" And someone else will say, ""Put a bunch of typos in your application so that you can say something original."" The problem with a lot of the advice on the Web is that it may be good, but you don't know where it's coming from. Are you supposed to trust someone who calls himself Puppy Wuppy or RodtheBod69? CNN: The problems you describe mainly concern those applying to higher-end universities, right? Ferguson: I don't want to sound ungrateful. These are high-class problems. The kind of craziness and frenzy that I describe is something well-to-do or prosperous people put on themselves. But it's seeping down into income levels where you wouldn't expect it. A lot of this is caused by things that are very admirable, like our love for our children and our desire to see them get ahead.","Andrew Ferguson writes book on how to survive getting your kid in college .

"(CNN) -- Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, who was due in court Thursday for his trial, has been hospitalized after falling ill, his lawyer told CNN. He was taken to a hospital on his doctor's orders, lawyer Ahmad Raza Kasuri said. His trial was subsequently postponed until Monday. Asiya Ishaq, a supporter and leader of the All Pakistan Muslim League, said the former President had been feeling pressure on his chest since Wednesday evening and was not well. When asked if he will go to Dubai for treatment, she said that ""Musharraf will not leave Pakistan."" Ishaq also said that as far as she knows, ""Musharraf has got three arteries blocked and is currently undergoing angiography,"" an artery-scanning procedure. Atiqa Odho, a Pakistani actor who's a former leader of the APML, a party that Musharraf launched in 2010, offered support for Musharraf on Thursday. ""I pray for President Musharraf's health and long life,"" she said. ""It is painful to see how heartbroken a great and brave man is, due to being let down by people who claimed to be his supporters."" Musharraf could be sentenced to life in prison or the death penalty if convicted on charges of treason. Prosecutors say he violated Pakistan's constitution by imposing emergency military rule in 2007. The former President ruled the country from 1999 to 2008. He went into exile in 2008 but came back to Pakistan last year, intending to run in the country's national elections. But his plans unraveled as he became entangled in a web of court cases relating to his time in power. The accusations . Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has accused Musharraf of illegally abrogating on the constitution in November 2007. That month, Musharraf declared a state of emergency, suspended Pakistan's constitution, replaced the chief judge and blacked out independent TV outlets. Musharraf said he did so to stabilize the country and to fight rising Islamist extremism. The action drew sharp criticism from the United States and democracy advocates. Pakistanis openly called for his ouster. Under pressure from the West, he later lifted the state of emergency and promised elections. Musharraf stepped down in August 2008 as the governing coalition began taking steps to impeach him. A spokeswoman for Musharraf said in November that he is willing to face all charges against him. ""Gen. Musharraf has full faith in the judiciary and trusts the legal system to clear his name,"" Aasia Ishaque told CNN. ""He is a man of his word, and he will let the court decide his fate.""

"(CNN) -- Citing recent attacks, the United States on Wednesday announced that it has suspended public services at its embassy in Sanaa, Yemen. ""Due to recent attacks against Western interests in Yemen, we have temporarily suspended operations of our Embassy in Sana'a to the public,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement. ""We continue to evaluate the security situation every day, and we will reopen the embassy to the public once it is deemed appropriate."" She described the move as a ""precautionary step."" The temporary suspension of operations is due to a reemergence of a threat from several weeks ago that the United States thought it had disrupted, according to a U.S. official with specific understanding of the current situation. A credible threat to the U.S. Embassy emerged around March, the official said, in the same time frame that a video appeared showing some 100 al Qaeda operatives in Yemen, including several who had broken out of jail the month before. The United States thought that threat had been disrupted by a number of Yemeni actions, including, but not directly related to a series of U.S. drone strikes and Yemeni military operations in early April. But in recent days, the threat stream has reemerged, the official said. It is currently assessed to be credible and somewhat specific in terms of the embassy being the target, according to the source. The United States is still attempting to corroborate the threat and determine whether there is a specific time and date, as well as any other specific locations. A second U.S. official said the suspension of the embassy activity was based on credible information about threats to Western interests. The senior official was not sure whether the threat was embassy-specific. There have been no evacuations of the embassy. The U.S. intelligence community has struggled in recent months to track al Qaeda in Yemen via electronic intercepts because the group has changed its communications, following disclosures last year of U.S. eavesdropping methods. Still, the United States is using electronic tracking, satellite imagery and operatives on the ground to try to determine what may be planned. The United Kingdom, meanwhile, advised against travel to Yemen and urged all British nationals to leave the country. ""There is a high threat from terrorism throughout Yemen and specific methods of attack are evolving and increasing in sophistication,"" the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said in a statement. It continued: ""Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has previously targeted western interests and there could be a threat to commercial sites, transport infrastructure, diplomatic missions and any place where westerners gather.""

"(CNN) -- Libyan militia members have apparently turned the abandoned U.S. Embassy in Tripoli, Libya, into a water park, judging by amateur video posted to YouTube on Sunday. The video, which reflects the anarchy that currently reigns in Libya's capital, shows fully clothed men diving into and swimming in a pool. Ambassador Deborah Jones, who is not currently in Libya, tweeted that the images appear to show a residential annex in the U.S. Embassy compound. But Jones said ""the U.S. Embassy Tripoli chancery & compound is now being safeguarded and has not been ransacked,"" and ""those who have actually visited the embassy know the truth."" A spokesman for the General National Congress says the militias securing the U.S. Embassy compound are still there safeguarding it. ""The militias are under the command of the Libyan General Staff, and what happened was not an attack on the embassy grounds, nor was it an attempt to ransack its offices,"" Omar Hmaidan said. ""What happened (the frolicking at the pool) was an isolated behavior by some of those who were in charge of protecting the compound. We don't condone it and we don't accept it,"" he said. A senior State Department official said the United States is ""seeking additional details"" about the incident. ""At this point, we believe the Embassy compound itself remains secure but we continue to monitor the situation on the ground, which remains very fluid,"" the official said. Libya Dawn, an alliance of militias, reinstated the General National Congress this month as the country's official parliament, despite international recognition of the new parliament elected in June. U.S diplomats evacuated Tripoli last month amidst heavy militia violence. CNN correspondent Jomana Karadsheh, who lived in Tripoli but had to evacuate weeks ago as well, says if true, the use of the empty embassy is no surprise. ""The fighting in Tripoli that erupted between militias in July and lasted for weeks was described by Libyan officials as 'unprecedented.' Many homes in parts of Tripoli have been looted by and ransacked by different militia groups during the fighting, including as recently as last week, the home of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni."" Al-Thinni is not in Tripoli currently. The U.S. State Department had not responded to CNN requests for comment as of this article's publication.

"(CNN) -- Injustice has no borders, as we at Oxfam know well from years of experience working in more than 90 countries. We also know that poverty has no political party in our own country, the United States. Last week Oxfam released a new study that dispels many of the political myths surrounding the nation's minimum wage debate. It shows not only that increasing the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 per hour would give some 25 million workers across America a much-needed raise, but also that, on average, one in five workers in every single congressional district in America -- red or blue -- would benefit from such a raise. In fact, according to our data, a hike in the minimum wage would benefit more than 55,000 workers in the average congressional district. We found that the workers who would gain most are concentrated in districts that are remarkably diverse, from highly condensed urban areas to poor rural areas. At the top of the list is East Los Angeles (31.8% of workers), followed by the largely rural south coastal district in Texas' 34th District (29.9% of workers). A district in the San Joaquin Valley of California is next, followed by more districts in Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley. Next on the list are districts in Dallas-Fort Worth (28.8% of workers), the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas (28.5% of workers), El Paso (27.9% of workers), the Bronx (27.6% of workers), and the boot heel of Missouri (27.3% of workers). Raising the minimum wage would equally help Americans who live in Republican and Democratic districts, rural and metropolitan. It would also pump money into the economy and save billions in taxpayer dollars by reducing the number of low-wage workers receiving federal assistance. It seems an obvious thing to do. From 1938, when a federal minimum wage was established, to its most recent increase in 2007 -- passed by overwhelming majorities in Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush -- most members of Congress recognized that as the cost of living goes up, so should the minimum wage. So why has the issue become bogged down in partisan politics that do little to serve our people or our future? We are lucky enough to live in a wealthy democracy, but Oxfam is seeing the same growing problem of inequality in America that we see in developing countries: Relatively few people hold more and more power. In principle, the United States is the land where all people are created equal. But in reality, political power is stacked in favor of the wealthy. Because of this imbalance, millions of hard-working Americans can't stop falling behind, working at jobs that pay under $10 per hour and rarely offer benefits -- some not even a day of paid sick leave. Our study found that at least one-fourth of Americans work at jobs that pay so little that they cannot sustain themselves and their families without turning to government programs or going into debt. The average age of a worker who would benefit from a minimum wage increase is 35. Most (55%) are women. Over a third are parents of dependent children. These are people like Tenesha Hueston, a single mother of four in Zebulon, North Carolina, who, according to a New York Times article in November, was making $7.75 an hour as a shift manager at a fast-food restaurant. Or Nick Mason, a father of two in Hixson, Tennessee, who made $9 an hour as an assistant manager at a pizza chain. They work these jobs year after year, while trying to care for their own children and parents, struggling to pay their bills. For them and people like them, the American Dream is a distant mirage. According to our analysis, raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would lift more than 5 million Americans out of poverty and help 14 million children see a boost in their family income. Fourteen million women, including 6 million working mothers, would get a raise. Three million single parents would be better able to sustain their families. The sad irony of the standoff in Congress over raising the minimum wage is that petty partisanship gets in the way of a deal that would benefit large numbers of constituents in every congressional district, seemingly a boon to elected representatives of both parties. At least, that has been the logic that led to bipartisan support for increasing the minimum wage 22 times before now. Members of Congress from each party need to be willing to overcome the divide: to be open to the debate, to consider the needs of hard-working constituents and taxpayers, to consider the wide range of benefits -- and ultimately, to give a raise to the people who need it the most.","Oxfam study: Minimum wage hike would help people in every congressional district .

"(CNN) -- Russia emerged as genuine contenders for football's European crown with a thumping 4-1 win over Czech Republic after co-hosts Poland and 2004 champions Greece had opened the tournament with a dramatic 1-1 draw in Warsaw. Alan Dzagoev scored twice as Dick Advocaat's Russia side made a confident start, Roman Shirokov and substitute Roman Pavlyuchenko completing the rout after Jaroslav Plasil had briefly threatened a Czech comeback. Russia, who reached the semi-finals of Euro 2008 under Guus Hiddink, next face co-hosts Poland, who saw Robert Lewandowski's first-half header cancelled out by Greece substitute Dimitris Salpingidis' second-half goal in Warsaw. But the goalscorers barely told the tale of a remarkable opening match. Both sides had a player sent off - Sokratis Papastathopoulos for Greece and Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny -- before the Arsenal goalkeeper's replacement Przemyslaw Tyton emerged as the hero by saving a penalty from Giorgos Karagounis. Poland 1-1 Greece . Two goals, two red cards and a missed penalty in the tournament's opening game meant that the focus of Euro 2012 shifted firmly to football. Fears of racism had dominated the build-up to the tournament and there was an inevitable feeling of relief when the opening game finally got under way in Warsaw. A brief but beautiful opening ceremony - just 12 minutes long - set the scene for the three-week tournament before the home crowd came close to lifting the closed roof off the National Stadium with a rousing rendition of the national anthem. It was a vocal chorused outside the stadium by 100,000 supporters crammed into a specially-built fan zone in the center of Warsaw -- and those almost exclusively Poland fans had plenty to shout about in the opening 20 minutes of the opening game. Co-hosts Poland looked to be cruising to their first-ever European Championship finals victory when Borussia Dortmund striker Lewandowski headed home Jakub Blaszczykowski's cross, with Greece keeper Kostas Chalkias stuck in no-man's land. It was a special moment for Lewandowski, who was born in Warsaw and proved a constant menace to the hapless Greek defence in a one-sided first half. Euro 2012: The best photos from day one . And when Greece lost both their starting centre backs - Avraam Papadopoulos limping off injured before Papastathopoulos was sent off for two bookings in nine first-half minutes -- it seemed a matter of how many for Lewandowski and Poland. Somehow, Greece manager Fernando Santos instigated a response to silence the Polish fans in and out of the stadium, with substitute Salpigidis the central character. Just six minutes after coming on as a half-time substitute, Salpigidis poked an equaliser past stranded goalkeeper Szczesny. Suddenly it was the Greek fans - so burdened by national crisis, so weighed down by Eurozone millstones - with something to celebrate. It got worse for Arsenal keeper Szczesny when he saw red for a clumsy trip on substitute Salpigidis, but his replacement Tyton guessed right to push away Greece captain Karagounis' penalty. The Warsaw party was back on -- and two of the tournament underdogs had set a high standard of entertainment for the rest to follow. Russia 4-1 Czech Republic . Over in Wroclaw, Russia and Czech Republic continued to defy Group A's pre-tournament image as the ""least exciting"" section, with Advocaat's side capitalising on some weak Czech defending. These two sides had been installed as favourites to qualify from the group, but only the Russians lived up to that hype in a game dominated by Advocaat's side. Former Arsenal forward Arshavin was the architecht of their dominance, playing a crucial part in the opening goal from Dzagoev and then playing a defence-splitting pass to set up Shirokov for the second. Pilar's superbly taken goal early in the second half gave the Czechs hope and they had chances to level before substitute Pavlyuchenko set up Dzagoev for his second and then himself wrapped up victory with a thumping finish. Pavlyuchenko had been ledft out of Russia's starting line-up, yet still played a crucial role in helping finish off the Czechs when he replaced the tiring Aleksandr Kerzhakov 17 minutes from time. It was a cameo role not lost on two-goal hero Dzagoev, who told Uefa's official website: ""It was hard for us at 2-1 but a big performance from Roman helped us and we want to thank him for this. ""It is very important that we performed well in the first game -- it is one of the six steps to the final."" Czech Republic coach Michal Bilek admitted his side had struggled to cope with the Russians' forward movement and link-up play. He conceded: ""We had problems with the combinations of the Russians. They had a lot of chances and we could not get the ball off them. Bilek added: ""They have great technique and showed us today what a great team they are.""","Two players sent off as co-hosts Poland draw 1-1 with 2004 champions Greece .

"(CNN) -- The driver hired to deliver an adopted Russian boy from the Moscow airport to the Russian education ministry last week said he was ""shocked like a crazy man"" when he realized what was happening. Seven-year-old Justin Artyem was sent back to Russia alone by the Tennessee family that adopted him because of what they said was violent and psychotic behavior. Arthur Lookyanov said the child was in ""a good mood"" during the two-hour ride Thursday morning, drawing pictures and playing with his Spiderman toy most of the time. But near the end of the ride, he cried, saying he missed ""Grandma Nancy,"" Lookyanov said. It was his adopted grandmother, Nancy Hansen, who bought Justin a one-way ticket on a United Airlines flight from Washington to Moscow and arranged for Lookyanov to meet him there. Lookyanov provided CNN with a copy of his e-mail exchanges with Hansen. ""I am interested in hiring you for a pick-up from DME (Domodedovo Airport) to the office of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation on Monday April 12th,"" Hansen initially wrote to Lookyanov, according to the e-mails. Lookyanov responded with an extensive e-mail that included references for his work as a professional driver for foreign visitors. His fee would be $120, he said. When Hansen later sent an e-mail to say she had booked a flight that would arrive on Thursday morning, she gave no hint that the passenger would be a child, Lookyanov said. ""I had not big plans so I can meet you at Domodedovo,"" Lookyanov wrote back to her. ""Where are you going to stay in Moscow?"" It was not until Wednesday that Hansen told him his passenger would be a young boy who would be escorted through the airport by an airline employee carrying an envelope with two envelopes inside it, according to the e-mails. ""One is an envelope for the Ministry of Education, Tverskaya Street, 11, Moscow,"" Hansen wrote. ""The other envelope will be addressed to you. Inside will be your payment in US Dollars."" Hansen instructed the driver to take the child inside the ministry and give the envelope to the receptionist. When Lookyanov and the boy arrived at the ministry, he knew something was ""terribly wrong"" when he realized that no one was expecting him. When several women came down to investigate why he was there, they opened the envelope intended for the ministry. ""I am sorry to say that for the safety of my family, friends and myself I no longer wish to parent this child,"" wrote Torry Hansen, the adoptive mother. An angry phone call to the United States followed, with Lookyanov talking to Nancy Hansen first, complaining that he had been deceived, he said. Although the driver's duty was completed, he said, he stayed with the boy throughout the day as they waited for juvenile authorities to pick him up. While they waited, Justin used his pencils to draw ""a beautiful house"" with only one small door. He also drew another boy who he said was Logan, his 10-year-old friend, according to Lookyanov. At the end of the day, just before the boy was taken to a special hospital, he gave his driver two gifts. He handed him the United Airline wings he was given on the plane and a picture he had drawn while waiting at the ministry. Lookyanov said the experience has left him sad and depressed. But the most difficult thing, he said, has been the negative comments made in the Russian media reports, some suggesting that he is partly to blame for the boy's plight. He said he wanted people to know that he had no idea his passenger was an adopted child being returned to Russia. The incident sparked outrage in Russia and the United States and threatens to bring a halt to adoptions between the two countries. Top officials from the U.S. State Department plan to travel to Moscow this week to push Russia to allow adoptions by U.S. families to continue. ""We were certainly shocked, as was everybody, about the return of the child,"" said Michael D. Kirby, principal deputy assistant for U.S. consular affairs. ""We are hoping to work with the Russians to continue the adoptions of children."" Nancy Hansen said Friday that the boy ""had a hit list of people he wanted to hurt."" No. 1 on that list: his American mom, Nancy Hansen said. The last straw, the adoptive grandmother said, came last week when the family caught the boy trying to start a fire in the home. A Russian psychologist who visited the boy Friday in a hospital in Moscow, where he was under evaluation to check his health, described him as ""very friendly"" and communicative. Galina Semya said she saw no aftereffects of psychological trauma, but ""he doesn't quite understand why he's here."" When children are adopted abroad, there are normally several stages of adaptation, including one involving cultural shock, in which children can start behaving aggressively, she said. Normally, children get over the stage after several months, she said. In Bedford County, Tennessee, where Hansen lives, a criminal investigation is under way, though authorities said they don't know whether any laws were broken in the case. Sheriff Randall Boyce said authorities are still trying to work out a meeting with Hansen and her mother. State Department officials told him they are not aware of any federal laws broken either, Boyce said, adding that officials in Bedford County are trying to unseal the boy's adoption records to research the adoption. Chuck Crawford, attorney general for the district, said officials have not determined whether the case constitutes child abandonment, but if there was, it took place at the airport in Washington, where the boy boarded the plane. Torry Hansen did not respond to requests for comment.","American family sent adopted boy back to Russia, claiming violent behavior .

"New York (CNN) -- Merging magazine cutouts, painted objects and even motorbike parts, Kenyan artist Wangechi Mutu creates layered images of fantastical figures, transforming the female form into something both powerful and primal. Famous for her collages, Mutu has had her work shown all over the world, including her most recent exhibition at the Guggenheim in Bilbao, Spain. Mutu's renderings challenge widespread depictions of the typical female form, creating a new kind of woman. Her creations have sometimes been described as grotesque, but she says it doesn't bother her at all. Speaking to CNN's Isha Sesay, Mutu said: ""It means that people are looking. It means their senses are on when they are in front of the work, which is important. Because for me, it's important to think about and understand what's in the work."" An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: I want to start by talking about your work and its content. Wangechi Mutu: There are a lot of bodies in the work, there are a lot of animal bodies and organisms and women and men's bodies and they all come together. They mesh up into shapes that are often female-like, and in the end I do obsess over the female form because that is the place where I want to express some of these issues I have with the way women's bodies are written upon and women's bodies are talked about and women's bodies are depicted. So that becomes my experiment. My lab is this female body that becomes this vessel where I place all of this stuff in. CNN: When we look at the female form in your work what are we seeing? WM: Often there's an emphasis in my work and it's sort of the celebrating of the body. I'm very much a person that believes that there's something that was introduced into Kenya and Africa as we know it that has made us despise our bodies. So that's the first thing -- I try to introduce something celebratory and interesting about the body, that the body is important. CNN: Despise is a strong word -- what do you mean with that? WM: Being taught to despise your body is being taught to perhaps admire someone else's body more than yours -- being taught that your body is good for certain things and not for others. It's good for labor, but it's not ideal if someone were to sit in a political post or something. It belongs in a certain frame and not in others and I think that was something taught to us, given to us or forced upon us. CNN: What's with the motorcycle parts? Because there seem to be motorcycle parts embedded in your work. What does that mean to you? WM: A lot of motorbikes have been built to look like women, and to feel as if you were on a woman. So I think that's also what I've been trying to sort of do is take apart this machine and implant it into these bodies and sort of give the women a kind of strength that the machine supposedly represents for the man. It's like they're taking it back and they become these cyborgs, these fierce female cyborgs. Who knows what they're going to do with that strength! But for me it's my little way of giving back the women that power that's taken away, especially in the representations of women in these kinds of magazines because they really are the focal point and in a way that sexualizes the machines so men will buy more of them. CNN: Your work has been described by some as both beautiful and grotesque, repulsive. Does it bother you? WM: No it doesn't bother me. It means that people are looking. It means their senses are on when they are in front of the work, which is important. For me, it's important to think about and understand what's in the work but I think visuals need to enter, they need to dissolve themselves into your psyche and if people start to get grossed out by something that's not overtly gross -- I mean it's a static image, it's not sort of throwing itself at you -- there must be some sort of wonderful process going on in their brain, which is good. CNN: The collages, let's talk about the form. I'm fascinated by them because someone who does collages strikes me as someone who has to be slightly OCD. Are you obsessive? WM: Very, yeah! I am very obsessive with this actual practice and technique because it calms me down. It's a meditative, calming obsession, believe it or not. It's like the monotony of when you knit, there's something about that rhythm that allows your mind to wander or at least allows for free association to happen. For me collages manage to, it satisfies all of my madness, like I'm able to make these obsessive things but then I'm also able to make these very strong statements. I don't know what they mean to other people, but in my mind they have a very strong particular resonance; there's sort of a power. I'm sort of fusing languages, which is actually a good way of talking about what Kenya is, in fact what Africa is, this fusion of people and this attempt to try and create commonality amongst people who don't come from the same place. So I feel that's very alive in the work, this sort of intense desire to bring it all together.","Wangechi Mutu is a Kenyan artist, famous for her powerful collages .

"Washington (CNN) -- Richard ""Dick"" Winters, a decorated hero of World War II and the central figure in the book and miniseries ""Band of Brothers,"" has died. He would have turned 93 years old in February. Winters died January 2 and was buried after a private funeral Saturday, according to retired Army Col. Cole Kingseed, a close friend and co-author of Winters' memoirs. Winters began his career in the Army shortly before the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, and he volunteered to become a paratrooper, according to his wartime memoirs ""Beyond Band of Brothers."" He was assigned to E Company, more commonly known as Easy Company, of the 2nd Battalion of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the Army's 101st Airborne Division. After months of training in the new tactic of soldiers dropping by parachute behind enemy lines, Winters and the men of Easy Company parachuted into Normandy hours before the first troops hit Omaha and Utah beaches on D-Day, June 6, 1944. When he landed he discovered he'd lost his ""leg bag,"" the satchel carrying all his weapons, when he jumped out of the plane. He was behind enemy lines on the most decisive day of World War II with nothing but a knife. ""I later discovered that in our small contingent from Easy Company, we all lost our leg bags and ended up using whatever weapons he could scrounge,"" Winters wrote in his memoirs. ""This was a hell of a way to begin a war."" Still, within hours he organized a small group of troopers to attack a German artillery position. They took out nearly two dozen Nazi soldiers and four large cannons which had been firing on American troops landing on the beaches. His actions that day earned Winters the Distinguished Service Cross, the second highest medal for valor in the U.S. military. There is still an effort underway to have that medal upgraded to a Medal of Honor, an action the humble Winters never supported. Kingseed said Winters told him, referring to the men he commanded in Europe, that ""war does not make men great, but sometimes, war brings out the greatness in men."" D-Day also cost Easy Company the life of its commander, which put then-Lt. Winters in command of the unit. He later led his men through Operation Market Garden, a major allied offensive in Holland in September 1944. In December of the year, Easy Company and the rest of the 101st were ordered to hold back a German offensive around the town of Bastogne in Belgium. Surrounded by Nazi troops and tanks and facing bitter cold with no winter clothing and limited food rations, Winters and the rest of the 101st held back the Germans and, along with other allied units, eventually repelled the enemy offensive. After leading his men in battle all the way into Germany, Easy Company eventually was assigned to occupy the ""Eagles Nest"" -- Hitler's mountaintop retreat near the Austrian/German border. A short time later, Winters left the Army with the rank of major and never saw combat again. He went on to become a successful businessman and a public speaker. Kingseed, who considered Winters his best friend, said he ""epitomized the citizen soldier"" who won World War II. Gen. David Petraeus, who has commanded the 101st Airborne Division during his career, said in a statement on Monday that ""Major Winters embodied the very best of what a leader and soldier should be. He and the men of Easy Company lived the ""brotherhood of the close fight."" ""The deeds of Dick Winters and his men from Easy Company will always live on,"" Petraeus said. Steven Spielberg, the Hollywood mogul who produced the ""Band of  Brothers"" mini-series, issued a release Monday saying in part, ""Dick Winters was at the vanguard of representing 'The Greatest Generation' in bringing honor to all his Band of Brothers."" Spielberg said Winters ""would not have wanted this credit. He would have simply asked all of us to never forget how his generation served this nation and the world in WWII."" Reaction also came from Tom Hanks, who co-produced the series, and from the actor who played Winters in ""Band of Brothers."" ""When our days run their course and a man like Dick Winters leaves us, time and providence remind us that human beings can do giant things,"" Hanks said in a statement. ""Dick Winters volunteered to go to war, leading paratroopers into unknown, yet certain, dangers. He led by both command and example; his wartime philosophy was simple -- 'Follow me.'"" Actor Damian Lewis, who portrayed Winters in the series, told CNN that Winters' support for him during the production was ""generous and unstinting. I'll never forget his rallying cry to me to 'hang tough!' ""He has died quietly, in private, without fanfare and with the same modesty that he lived his life as one of the true heroes of his generation,"" Lewis added. Winters did not make any money off his memoirs or the speeches he gave later in his life.  His royalties from the book went to a variety of organizations, including veterans groups, breast-cancer research organizations and the Ronald McDonald house in Hershey, Pennsylvania, where he lived for years. His family is planning a public memorial service for Winters in the near future. In the meantime, his family is asking that in remembrance of Winters, donations can be sent to any veterans hospital. Winters is survived by his wife, Ethel, and a son, a daughter and a grandson.","The mini-series ""Band of Brothers"" told the story of Easy Company .

"(CNN) -- Federal agents are conducting a criminal investigation that could affect the trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others accused of plotting the 2001 terrorist attacks, Justice Department lawyers told a U.S. military court Monday in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The lawyers, in a filing with the court Monday, acknowledged for the first time that the inquiry existed but also requested more time to determine its scope and how it could affect the planned 9/11 trial. That request came after preliminary proceedings for the planned military commissions trial were halted recently when defense attorneys for defendant Ramzi bin al Shibh said a member of the defense team was approached by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and asked to become a confidential informant in an ongoing probe. Defense lawyers said they believed it was related to what military prosecutors said was the unauthorized publication in January of a manifesto written by Mohammed. The defense viewed the FBI's involvement as causing a potential conflict of interest that could prompt defense lawyers to resign. Such a move could force even more delays of a trial not expected to start until next year, 14 years after the terror attacks. In the Monday public filing, a special team of Justice Department lawyers set up specifically to handle the dispute said only that the ongoing FBI ""preliminary investigation"" includes ""classified information"" but has nothing to do with the publication of the Mohammed manifesto. The lawyers said that they provided more detailed information in a separate filing with the court but that document would not be made public to preserve the investigation. ""Contrary to the apparent belief of defense counsel ... and the (military) commission.... the FBI preliminary investigation does not pertain to the disclosure of Mr. Mohammed's written communications to third parties,"" the public court filing said. The government lawyers asked the military court for 30 days to provide ""more complete"" information to the military court to address the conflict claims.","The FBI is conducting a criminal investigation that may affect the 9/11 trial, lawyers said .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Proclaiming ""I am a soldier for the Cuban revolution,"" a Cuban intelligence agent said Friday he has no regrets about the spying that landed him in U.S. prisons for more than a decade. ""I felt that it was the right thing to do,"" René González said during a press conference in Havana. González was a member of the so-called ""Cuban Five,"" a network of agents in South Florida that the Cuban government said was gathering intelligence to prevent terrorist attacks against Cuba. U.S. federal prosecutors called the network a dangerous undercover spy cell. The men were convicted in 2001 and ever since have been the focus of an international campaign by Cuban officials to free them. González was released from prison in October 2011 but was required to serve three years probation in the United States. Last week, however, U.S. Judge Joan Lenard ruled that if González, who had already been allowed to temporarily return to Cuba for his father's funeral, could stay there provided he renounce his U.S. citizenship. In her ruling Lenard wrote that federal prosecutors had said González would be less of a security risk to the United States if he returned to Cuba. Previously, prosecutors had argued that González should not be allowed to go back to Cuba. On Friday, Gonzalez showed off a certificate issued by the U.S. State Department that confirmed he had renounced his U.S. citizenship. Despite the reversal by federal authorities, González said his early return to Cuba did not demonstrate a thawing of U.S.-Cuba relations. ""This was no humanitarian gesture,"" he said. ""This was a decision we forced the U.S. government to take. The only option they had was to look worse."" González's comments did not bode well for jailed U.S. State Department contractor Alan Gross, who was sentenced in 2011 to a 15-year prison for importing banned communications equipment to Cuba. Last year, Cuban officials said Gross might be freed if the United States made a ""humanitarian gesture"" and agreed to negotiations over the five imprisoned Cuban agents. U.S. officials have dismissed the possibility of talks, saying Gross did not spy against Cuba. Born in the United States to pro-Castro Cuban parents, González returned with them to Cuba where he became an experienced pilot. González said before leaving for the United States, he was told by government officials that he could still back out of the mission. ""I was told first of all that it was a voluntary assignment,"" he said. ""No one forced me in any way. I felt that it was the right thing to do."" González later flew with the Cuban exile group Brothers to the Rescue, which scoured the Florida Straits by small plane looking for Cuban rafters. In 1996, four members of the group were killed after their planes were shot down by Cuban military aircraft as the group's planes flew towards the island to drop anti-government leaflets. Federal prosecutors argued that information supplied by the Cuban Five agents assisted in the downing of the planes. ""Some times when I would fly with them and they would manifest their resentment,"" González said Friday. ""I would daydream to myself that I was the first Cubana (Airlines) pilot to land a plane in the United States."" González said he will now dedicate himself to bringing back to Cuba the four other still-incarcerated agents.","René González spent years in U.S. prisons after being convicted in 2001 .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A massive anti-mafia sweep that stretched from New York to Sicily has not only cut off the head of the Gambino crime family but lopped off ""the shoulders and chest"" too, a spokesman for the attorney general of New York said. John ""Jackie the Nose"" D'Amico, shown in 1992, is one of 62 Gambino crime family members indicted. Sixty-two people from the Gambino, Genovese and Bonanno families face 80 charges, ranging from money laundering, to illegal gambling and murder. ""These charges strike at the very core of the Gambino family,"" Benton Campbell, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York said Thursday. According to the charges, the Gambino family profited from extortion within the New York construction industry and its labor unions. Several companies allegedly paid a ""mob tax"" in return for ""protection"" and ""permission to operate,"" said Inspector General Hedell from the U.S. Department of Labor.  Watch as dozens charged in anti-mafia sweep » . Other charges involve an alleged illegal gambling ring, said Richard Brown, Queens County District Attorney. Brown alleged that Nicholas Corozzo, a reputed captain in the Gambino family, was involved in a sports gambling enterprise that relied, in part, on toll-free telephones. According to the indictment, four members of the Gambino family are charged with eight crimes involving murder. Those charges include the murder of Jose Delgado Rivera, who was shot and killed in an armored truck during a robbery in 1990. ""Today we are able to bring closure to crimes from the past that have never been forgotten,"" said Campbell. He said crimes span over three decades. Key to the Gambino arrests was someone from the attorney general's Organized Crime Task Force who infiltrated the Gambino family and recorded hundreds of hours of conversations, said John Milgrim, a spokesman for the attorney general. They not only cut off the head of the organization but ""the shoulders and chest"" too, said Milgrim. Forty-five of those charged are already in custody, police said. Arrests were made in New York City, Long Island and New Jersey. ""It is as unrelenting as weeds that continue to sprout in the cracks of society,"" New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said of organized crime. ""We will not rest until organized crime is a distant memory."" In addition to the arrests in the New York area, police in Italy made 77 arrests in connection with organized crime. Francesco Gratteri of the Italian National Anti-Crime Police said they arrested 23 in Palermo, the rest in New York. These arrests were of important members of a powerful clan in Sicily linked to mafia boss Salvatore Lo Piccolo, who was believed to be the successor to the boss of bosses, Bernardo Provenzano, police said. Police added that, in his attempt to rise to power, Lo Piccolo tried to mend fences with New York-based mafia families after those ties were broken during the bloody mafia wars of the 1980's. These families included the Gambinos of New York and the Inzerillos of Italy. Provenzano was arrested two years ago in Corleone. ""It is evident that the intent of the mafia in Palermo was to re-establish a dialogue through the Inzerillo family in the U.S.,"" said Francesco Messineo of the Italian police. ""A dialogue that was never interrupted because the relationship between the American and the Italian mafia is historic, based on long tradition. But there was certainly an attempt to re-establish that connection."" Investigators believe mob clans wanted to collaborate on illegal commercial ventures such as money-laundering and drug-trafficking. Italian officials said the arrests were aimed at preventing these illegal activities, but they warned that other mafia clans in Sicily oppose the return of the Inzerillo family to the island, and therefore were concerned about a new mafia war.

"(CNN) -- It has been 20 years since filmmaker Michael Moore took on General Motors in ""Roger and Me."" He's still sticking it to big business for what he sees as the deliberate shafting of the little guy. Filmmaker Michael Moore says Wall Street created a ""invisible virtual casino"" with people's money. His new film, ""Capitalism: A Love Story,"" opened Wednesday in New York and Los Angeles, California, and opens nationwide next week. Moore talked with CNN's Larry King about whether capitalism is key to the American dream or the cause of an American nightmare. The following is an edited version of the interview. Larry King: You describe this movie as the culmination of all the films you've made. Does that mean this is it? Michael Moore: No. I hope not. It means that, for 20 years, as you said, I've been doing this. I started out by showing people what General Motors was up to and how this was a company that was making a lot of bad decisions and it wasn't good for the company nor for the country. That was 20 years ago. And since then, I've covered a number of issues and different things. But it all seems to come back to this one issue of ""follow the money."" Who's got the money? And whoever has the money has the power. And right now, in America, tonight, Larry, the richest 1 percent have more financial wealth than the bottom 95 percent combined. King: You're in that 1 percent, though? Moore: I don't think I'm in that 1 percent, but I make documentary films. But I mean, obviously, I do well because my films have done well. But, you know, even if I were, I think it's my responsibility -- my moral duty that if I've done well, that I have to make sure that everybody else. King: Does well too or has a chance? Moore: Well, has at least a chance but that -- and that the pie is divided fairly amongst the people and not just a few people get the majority of the loot and everybody else has to struggle for the crumbs. King: Are you saying capitalism is a failure? Moore: Yes. Capitalism. Yes. Well, I don't have to say it. Capitalism, in the last year, has proven that it's failed. All the basic tenets of what we've talked about the free market, about free enterprise and competition just completely fell apart. As soon as they lost, essentially, our money, they came running to the federal government for a bailout -- for welfare, for socialism. And I thought the basic principle of capitalism was that it's a sink-or-swim situation. And those who do well, the cream rises to the top and, you know, those who invest their money wrongly or, you know, don't run their business the right way, then they don't do well. Watch Moore talk about corporate greed . And if you run your business the wrong way, where does it say that you or I or anybody watching this has to bail them out? I understand why everybody seemed to get behind it, because a lot of people were afraid, because these people down on Wall Street had taken our money and made bets with it. I mean, they essentially created this invisible virtual casino with people's money -- people's pension funds, people's 401(k)s. They took this money and they made bets. And then they made bets on the bets. And then they took out insurance policies on the bets. And then they took out insurance against the insurance -- the credit default swaps. King: You started filming before Lehman Brothers went belly up. Moore: Yes. King: The stock market tanked. Now, how did the events, as it occurred, affect the movie? Did it change gears? Moore: It didn't change in terms of what I was looking at, but it did, obviously, offer probably the best example of why this is a system that is really corrupt at its core -- corrupt because it doesn't, it isn't run with democratic -- small ""d"" -- democratic principles. There's no democracy in our economy. You and I and the people watching have no say in how this economy is run. The upper 1 percent, the people down on Wall Street, the corporate executives, they're the people that control this economy. King: And they don't want to see the economy do well? They don't want to see people... Moore: Oh, they sure do. King: Don't they want people to make money so they can buy the products? I mean it's silly if they want people unemployed? Moore: Oddly enough, yes. King: Why? Moore: I'll tell you why. Because your employees are your biggest expense. And, as you've noticed in the last few months, as the unemployment rate has gone up, so has the Dow Jones. Now, you'd think, you know, that Wall Street would respond with ""Oh, my God, unemployment is going up, you know, this is bad for business."" But the reality is, is that Wall Street likes that. They like it when companies fire people because immediately the bottom line is going to show a larger profit. King: Are you saying the investor is more important than the employee? Moore: Yes. The investor -- and the investor, these days, they want the short-term, quick profit and they want it now. But in the long-term, here's what happened. When I was on this show 20 years ago, 20 years ago this week, I was here with ""Roger and Me"". King: I remember. Moore: And General Motors, that year, made a profit of $4 billion. And yet they had just laid off another 30,000 people. Now, why would you lay people off when you're making a record profit of $4 billion? I mean that was totally insane. But they thought, well, you know, we can make a bigger profit. Maybe we can make $4.2 billion if we move those jobs to Mexico. And so they're always, you know, we can make a little bit more money if we do this. By firing those workers, Larry, they got rid of the very people who buy their cars.","Filmmaker Michael Moore takes on capitalism in his latest documentary .

"(CNN) -- It's not your imagination: Our politics are more polarized than at any point in recent history. That's the conclusion of a new survey from the indispensable Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. And if you needed more evidence of the passionate and sometimes poisonous polarization afflicting our nation, you didn't have to look further than the crowds in Wisconsin on Tuesday night after the recall attempt. Here's the real wake-up call: Americans are more divided about partisan politics right now than they are about race, class, gender and age. That's right: Forget the original sin of slavery and the longstanding fights over civil rights -- those old divisions now seem small compared with perceptions of whether a person is a Republican or Democrat. Welcome to the new bigotry, where a person's partisan identification is a source of prejudice, seen as a reflection of fundamentally different values, representative of an alien America. Like any form of prejudice, this is learned behavior, exacerbated by the daily drumbeat of partisan media. Conservatives are led to believe that liberals are essentially less patriotic and secretly socialist, while some liberals believe that conservatives are bigoted Bible thumpers. The mutual distrust leads members of different parties to feel unfairly judged by the other side, further fueling polarization -- and so fellow Americans divide into warring camps, us against them. Partisan difference didn't always seem like an unbridgeable divide. But over the past 25 years, the split on basic values between Republicans and Democrats has skyrocketed. For example, on the issue of the environment, at the end of the Reagan era, 86% of Republicans and 93% of Democrats believed that ""there needs to be stricter laws and regulations to protect the environment."" That broad consensus has fallen apart -- now, 47% of Republicans support that statement, while Democrats' sentiment remains the same. Likewise, take a look at attitudes regarding the social safety net -- a quarter century ago 62% of Republicans and 79% of Democrats believed that government should ""take care of people that could not take care of themselves."" Today, 40% of Republicans believe in that aspect of the social contract, while 75% of Democrats still do. What happened to compassionate conservatism? These policy divides reflect increased ideological and demographic differences between the two parties. Over two-thirds of Republicans self-identify as conservative and 87% are non-Hispanic white, with an average age of 50. Democrats are evenly split between liberals and centrists, more racially diverse than ever before and less likely to be religious or have ""old-fashioned values about family and marriage."" There is however a hopeful sign beneath the hyper-partisanship -- a healthy rebellion against this division and consequent dysfunction in Washington. According to the Pew survey, a record number of Americans are declaring their independence and proactively rejecting both the Republican and Democratic parties. In fact, there are more independents than Democrats or Republicans. It is a direct reaction against the unprecedented polarization of the two parties. And this ain't no mushy middle. As in surveys past, we can see that independent voters tend to be closer on economic issues to Republicans and closer to Democrats on social issues. Most importantly, while the two parties are deeply polarized, independent voters' attitudes on issues most closely parallel the American people as a whole. At heart, most Americans are nonideological problem-solvers, and that's a quality we see less and less of in our politicians. Why does this growing polarization matter? First, because it is resulting in an inability of the two parties to reason together on pressing issues such as improving the economy or dealing with the deficit and the debt. But more broadly, it risks undermining a core bit of American wisdom expressed in our national motto -- e pluribus unum: out of many, one. Democracy requires competing political parties, but they are not supposed to take the place of tribal affiliations. That they are is evidence of group-think that pushes the idea that people who think differently about politics or policy are not merely mistaken but a clear and present danger to the Constitution. That's the way political opponents become enemies -- even (and especially) if we don't know them personally. Changing the culture of hyper-partisanship will take time. It requires pushing back at the constant drumbeat of partisan media that polarizes in the pursuit of profit. It requires showing that there is a strong alternative, a better way to conduct civic debates. But this effort is essential to restoring common sense and collegiality to our politics. We can take comfort from the wise words of the original founding father, George Washington, who devoted a considerable portion of his farewell address to warning against the dangers and distortions of hyper-partisanship: ""One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts,"" he wrote. ""You cannot shield yourselves too much against the jealousies and heartburnings which spring from these misrepresentations; they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: Pew study confirms politics divides Americans more than race, class, age, gender .

"BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- A federal immigration judge says President Obama's aunt, who has stayed in the United States illegally for years, will be allowed to remain in the country until at least next year. Judge Leonard Shapiro said Wednesday he would hear Zeituni Onyango's political asylum case on February 4, 2010. Onyango, who is the half sister of the president's late father, applied for political asylum in 2002 due to violence in her native Kenya, according to her spokesman, Mike Rogers. Onyango was a legal resident of the United States at the time and had received a Social Security card a year earlier. Onyango's asylum request was turned down in 2004, and she has been living in the U.S. illegally since then, after twice appealing and twice being ordered to leave. Wednesday's hearing at the U.S. Immigration Court in Boston was closed to the media at the request of Margaret Wong, Onyango's attorney. Lawyers for the Department of Homeland Security are defending an order to deport Onyango. White House spokesman Ben LaBolt says President Obama is staying out of the matter and that ""the president believes that the case should run its ordinary course."" When the initial appearance was over, Onyango, wearing a red wig and dark glasses, was escorted through a side door of the courthouse to avoid news cameras staking out the main entrances. Onyango lives in public housing in South Boston and volunteers as a health advocate for people in her housing complex. She reportedly attended inauguration events for her nephew in January accompanied by her lawyer.","Judge: President Obama's aunt can stay in U.S. until asylum case is heard in 2010 .

"(CNN) -- England captain John Terry braved the public eye despite continuing revelations about his private life, but his table-topping Chelsea team were held to a shock 1-1 draw at relegation-threatened Hull City on Tuesday night. British media had reported that Terry would miss the Premier League match to be with his wife Toni, who is supposedly in Dubai to get away from allegations about his infidelity. But the defender and father of two, whose role as national captain is in doubt after he allegedly had an affair with the ex-partner of his former Chelsea teammate Wayne Bridge, fronted up at the KC Stadium to jeers from the home fans. Terry scored the winner against Burnley in his first match since the media storm broke, having failed in his bid to win a court injunction to prevent any such publication, but this time saw his team squander a great chance to move four points clear of second-placed Manchester United. Indeed, the Londoners needed an equalizer from Didier Drogba on his return from Africa Cup of Nations duty with the Ivory Coast to move two ahead of United, with both teams having now played 24 out of a scheduled 38 matches. Chelsea should have taken the lead in the 25th minute when Germany midfielder Michael Ballack headed Branislav Ivanovic's cross straight at goalkeeper Boaz Myhill when unmarked in front of goal. And the visiting defense were caught out five minutes later when Hull center-back Steven Mouyokolo escaped his marker Ballack and rose above Terry to head home winger Stephen Hunt's corner. Myhill denied France striker Nicolas Anelka and Portuguese midfielder Deco, but was powerless as Drogba curled home a right-footed free-kick three minutes before halftime. It was the striker's 20th league goal this season, and his second against Hull this season. Defender Anthony Gardner should have put Hull back in front after the break but headed Tom Cairney's free-kick over the bar from close range, then Terry was booked for a clumsy challenge on Jozy Altidore. The United States striker should have made Chelsea pay, but completely mistimed his header from Hunt's delivery. Chelsea pressed for a winner, but Myhill denied substitute forward Dean Sturridge late on to leave the hosts third from bottom. Meanwhile, Wolverhampton Wanderers, the team immediately above Hull in the table, were knocked out of the FA Cup after losing 3-1 at second division Crystal Palace. Palace, who were forced into administration last month with debts of $48 million, can look forward to a money-spinning fifth-round tie at home to Premier League high-flyers Aston Villa after winning the replay. Danny Butterfield, usually a defender but forced into playing up front due to the club's injury problems, scored three times in six second-half minutes before Karl Henry netted a late consolation for the visitors. Butterfield had scored just once in six seasons before the match. Premier League side Wigan Athletic also suffered an embarrassing cup exit, losing 2-0 at home to fourth division Notts County. County, also in financial difficulties following the failed pre-season takeover which brought former England manager Sven Goran Eriksson to the club as director of football, will travel to Premier League side Fulham in the fifth round. Stephen Hunt put County, the world's oldest professional league club and the lowest-ranked team left in the tournament, ahead with 15 minutes left as he headed in a corner by Ben Davies. Davies was again involved as Wigan's new signing Gary Caldwell deflected the ball into his own net three minutes later.","John Terry's table-topping Chelsea team held to shock 1-1 draw at struggling Hull .

"(CNN) -- English Premier League leaders Chelsea have successfully ended their dispute with French club Lens over the signing of Gael Kakuta, ending the possibility of a worldwide transfer suspension until mid-2011. Football's world governing body FIFA initially punished the London side in September after Lens complained that they had illegally induced the teenage Kakuta to breach his contract in 2007. Chelsea took the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, who suspended the ban until a hearing could be heard, making it possible for manager Carlo Ancelotti to make signings in the January transfer window. It had been speculated that owner Roman Abramovich would bankroll a huge spending spree to safeguard against the appeal failing, but Chelsea made no moves in the market despite losing four key players to the Africa Cup of Nations tournament in Angola. CAS announced on Thursday that it had ratified an agreement between Chelsea and Lens which had effectively ended the arbitration procedure. ""The two clubs and the player have recognized that the contract between the player and RC Lens was not valid,"" the appeal body said. ""Accordingly, the player could not have terminated it prematurely and without just cause and Chelsea cannot therefore be liable for inducing a breach of contract. ""As a consequence, in light of these new circumstances, the sanctions imposed upon Chelsea FC and the player by the FIFA Dispute Resolution Chamber had to be lifted. ""In accordance with the parties' request, the entire proceedings including the arbitral award and the agreement shall remain confidential and the CAS will not comment on this matter any further."" The 18-year-old Kakuta, who was voted the side's academy player of the year in his first 12 months with Chelsea, received a personal suspension of four months as a result of the initial ruling and was also fined $1 million. Chelsea were fined $180,000 to cover player development costs, which the club said they would still pay Lens. ""It was always our intention to work together with Lens to reach this end, and both clubs have strengthened their relationship as a result of resolving this case to everyone's satisfaction,"" chairman Bruce Buck told the Chelsea Web site. ""In an act of good faith and with a view to the possibility of future collaboration with Lens, and without recognizing any liability, Chelsea has agreed to pay compensation costs for the training given to the player while at Lens, as mandated by FIFA in its original ruling."" Meanwhile, Premier League crisis club Portsmouth have had a fourth change of ownership in six months, and there is likely to be another before the end of this season. Hong Kong-based businessman Balram Chainrai, who was born in Nepal but has a UK passport, has taken over Ali Al Faraj's 90 percent stake after activating a clause in their $27 million loan agreement. The UK Press Association reported that the Saudi's lawyer is contesting that action, but Chainrai is seeking to stabilize the debt-ridden club's finances before selling his shares. He will try to delay the winding-up hearing scheduled for next Wednesday over $11.8 million in unpaid taxes. ""The club will now apply to HMRC to adjourn next week's winding-up hearing to allow time for the club to be stabilized and new owners found,"" Portsmouth said in a statement on the club's Web site on Thursday. ""Peter Storrie continues as the chief executive officer of the club and continues to run the club."" Portsmouth said Al Faraj's financial advisor Daniel Azougy would no longer be involved in the club. The lawyer has been convicted of fraud in his native Israel, PA reported.","Chelsea end dispute with French club Lens over the signing of teenager Gael Kakuta .

"(CNN) -- United States + favorite hasn't necessarily ='d gold, but it sure did Monday. Also, Bode Miller is being quite the gentleman about how NBC treated him after his race, and even giant blowers couldn't help keep the weather from causing a damper. Still holding hands . Meryl Davis and Charlie White started as partners while still in elementary school. They lived 10 minutes apart. Their parents were good friends. They went to the same skating club. That was 17 years ago. They are still a team. A gold-medal-winning ice dance team. They were sure-bets to win, and they didn't even come close to disappointing anyone in Sochi. They dazzled the audience to convincingly defeat their rivals and training mates from Canada, Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir. The gold was the first in ice dance for the United States, which has seven first-place finishes in past men's and women's competitions at the Olympics. The 15 golds are the most of any nation. ""Not really sure how to express (how it feels to win),"" White said. ""It's something that you dream about. It's been an amazing journey."" The journey included sharing a coach with Virtue and Moir as they trained together in Michigan. ""We have been pushing each other and learning from each other not just for the last four years, but since 2006,"" Davis said. ""We learned so much from Tessa and Scott, and the training on a daily basis is what's been pushing us."" Bode says it's OK . If Bode Miller is upset with NBC over an interview that ended with him in tears, he's being very diplomatic about it. If you missed it, Miller won a bronze in the men's super-G alpine skiing race Sunday. After the race, NBC reporter Christin Cooper asked him about his emotions and stuck with the questions after Miller teared up talking about his brother, Chelone, a snowboarder with his own Olympic aspirations who died last year at age 29. Miller -- who ended up unable to speak, doubled over and crying -- said Monday he doesn't blame her for asking the questions. ""Pushing is part of it, she wasn't trying to cause pain,"" he wrote on Twitter. He also went on NBC, telling Matt Lauer that he has known Cooper, a two-time Olympian in alpine skiing, for a long time. He called her a sweetheart and said he felt bad she was catching heat from television critics and what seems to be 99.9% of the Internet. ""I don't think she really anticipated what my reaction was going to be, and I think by the time she sort of realized, it was too late,"" he said. Miller still has the giant slalom race on Wednesday and the slalom on Saturday. Another drought broken . If your team has a 62-year-old drought of some sort, the man to call is Steven Holcomb. He has ended two such streaks, but it would help if your problem involved a bobsled. Holcomb is one of the best drivers on the planet when it comes to guiding a sled down a tube of ice. In Vancouver, he and his team won the first U.S. bobsled gold since 1948 in four-man. On Monday he won a medal in two-man, the first podium finish for the Americans since 1952. It almost didn't happen. Holcomb told reporters at a news conference that he has a calf injury that affects his start, and he and his teammate considered withdrawing. But he figured that if he did strain something further, at least when he competes in four-man on Saturday, he'll have two more teammates to help him push. And he wished for continued success for Team USA sleds in the Olympics. ""To go away having broken those two droughts is a good feeling. To know we're going to go down in the record books,"" he said. ""Hopefully it's not another 62 years."" Hard to shoot when you can't see . Tuesday looks like it will be green with some purple and lavender and a hint of white. We're not talking about a figure-skating outfit; we're looking at the weather forecast map. And it doesn't look good. CNN Senior Weather Producer Brandon Miller says Tuesday could be the first day of significant precipitation at the Winter Olympics, with the mountain venues looking at the possibility of rain mixed with sleet. There will be snow at higher elevations. And the air could be thick with fog. That means we might see a fourth postponement of the men's mass start biathlon event, which was pushed back from Sunday to Monday and then to Tuesday after fog spoiled the conditions. Snowboard cross was also knocked back a day. Not even giant blowers could send away the fog. You gotta love International Olympic Committee officials. They always see things on the bright side. ""I believe the temperatures are dropping in the last day or so,"" said IOC spokesman Mark Adams. ""It seems to be that no event has been canceled so far compared with previous Games in Vancouver, Nagano and Sarajevo."" The Hero of Belarus . All hail Darya Domracheva! I'm sorry. You don't know her, do you? Well, you're not from Belarus then. She's the leading gold medal winner at these Olympics (so far). In fact, she's only the 10th woman to win three golds in one Winter Games. And she's the winningest Olympian in her country's history. If you're wondering, she's won three biathlon events -- the 10-kilometer pursuit, the 15-kilometer individual race and Monday's 12.5-kilometer mass start. She finished a measly ninth in the sprint event. She's been named as a ""Hero of Belarus"" -- that'll look nice on a business card -- by President Alexander Lukashenko. ""From the depth of our souls we congratulate you on the Motherland's supreme award -- the Hero of Belarus title,"" he wrote, according to the English version of the country's website. She said she is really happy about that title, but she just wants to relax now. ""Maybe it sounds strange, but I don't think I did something special,"" she told reporters. ""I did my race and my biathlon. The (medals) record sounds great and it is amazing, but right now I just feel tired. I wish I could just lie in bed.""","After almost two decades together, U.S. figure skaters win gold .

"London (CNN) -- More than six decades ago, the European Movement's founder Jean Monnet shared his vision for the region's nascent union, prescribing money as a means to heal the wounds left by two world wars. ""The fusion"" of Europe's economic ties, he said, would compel its nations ""to fuse their sovereignty"" as well ""into that of a single European state."" To the Frenchman, a federal Europe was the natural progression of the bloc's newfound stability. A collection of like-minded countries whose shared goals were so clear they would willingly surrender their own governments for the group's greater good. That was 1952. A time when the future held great promise after the horrors of the past and anything seemed possible -- even creating a new pseudo country. A place now known as the European Union. Fast forward to the present day and, though the EU does have some shared organs of government, like a commission and parliament, it certainly isn't the set of ""united states"" Monnet hoped for. Ones with the same deep-seated convictions and beliefs. The glue holding their common ideologies together came unstuck with the fall of the Berlin Wall. Since then, a crisis among countries sharing the euro has reopened old wounds. Ironically, instead of bringing nations together, their finances have threatened to tear them apart. This leaves us with one fundamental question: if the EU's main task is no longer to provide peace, and it can't guarantee prosperity either, then what should its role be? Born from the ashes of Europe's turbulent past, the EU has accomplished much for its members. It has taught its citizens value of compromise over violence, providing protection and strength in numbers. It has boosted prosperity, thanks to the free flow of goods and labor brought about by the single market, while consumer and workers' rights have been reinforced and their health improved thanks to bans on smoking. But the EU has also drifted far from its original concept, its ranks swollen by a massive Brussels-based bureaucratic machine which, critics say, is stifling industry and is pushing members like the UK towards the exit door. The bloc's borders have doubled with its endless absorption of former communist countries, stretching the definition of Europe to its limits, making membership to this formerly elite club appear more like a handy foreign policy tool rather than a cherished vision. The EU faces a constant challenge living up to the expectations of its citizens and without two-tier policies it has no hope of serving both the bloc's strong and weak economies alike. The EU needs a new vision a new project its people can feel passionate about. And where better to start then this week's pivotal parliamentary elections.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Open champion Novak Djokovic has vowed to win the French Open -- the only major championship he failed to win this year -- and in the process complete a career Grand Slam. The 24-year-old Serb, talking to CNN after his four-set victory over Spain's Rafael Nadal at Flushing Meadows, believes his form is so good he can break Nadal's virtual monopoly on the clay court event. ""It is going to take a lot of effort. I don't think that I need to change anything specific in my game,"" Djokovic said. ""I need to believe. I need to get out there and go for my shots. I need to maintain that. It is not an easy thing to do. Clay...is a slower surface in the sport and requires a different approach and Nadal has been winning the French Open for so many year in a row. Can anybody break the dominance of Djokovic? ""It is going to be difficult to win against him on that tournament. But I am confident that I have a better chance than I ever did next year."" Djokovic's victory in the U.S. Open was just the tip of what has been a remarkable year. It is his third Grand Slam of 2011 following his triumphs at Wimbledon and the Australian Open. In total he has won 10 tournaments, playing 66 matches. He has lost just twice this year. ""It will be a big challenge to do even half what I done this year for 2012,"" he told CNN. ""I'm still very young, very much motivated every time I step on the court. I have a huge will to win and this is something that keeps me going and I'll try and win as many majors as I can."" Reflecting on an almost perfect 2011, Djokovic believes that his incredible run has helped him win an advantage against the two players he views as his main rivals. ""It is obvious it has been the best year of my career,"" Djokovic told CNN. ""I think I matured as a player on the court, I have much more self belief. I'm using the confidence I had from the incredible run this year. When you are winning that many matches you obviously feel more comfortable on the court. ""When I'm playing my big rivals Federer and Nadal I'm stepping on the court and wanting to be aggressive and take my chances. It has been a dream run and a dream year and I'm enjoying every single moment of it."" Djokovic also described the moment when he saved two match points against Federer in the semifinals, a moment that turned the match and the tournament in his favor. ""It is hard to say that I have been very relaxed in that moment because I was two match points down and very close to losing and going home,"" he recalled. ""This is what happens at this level. When you're playing great champions like Federer and Nadal the guys are always playing their best at the later stages of major events. ""They have been so dominate in the last couple few years. You need to come up with those shots. ""I closed my eyes and hit the ball as hard as I could, and luckily for me it went in.""","Novak Djokovic speaks to CNN's World Sport .

"Beijing (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton held talks with a string of Chinese officials in Beijing on Wednesday but appeared to gain little traction on the sensitive issue of the competing maritime claims of China and its neighbors in the region. After receiving a hostile welcome in editorials and articles in the Chinese news media when she arrived Tuesday, Clinton also had to contend with the abrupt cancellation of her planned meeting with Vice President Xi Jinping, who is expected to become the next Chinese president. Beijing attributed the decision to unspecified scheduling reasons. China talks tough in Japan island dispute . After meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi on Wednesday, Clinton repeated the U.S. position on the territorial disputes between China and other countries in the South China Sea, urging those involved to ""begin to engage in a diplomatic process toward the shared goal of a code of conduct."" Tensions over territorial disputes have spiked this year between China and a string of countries around its coastline -- from Vietnam in the south to Japan in the northeast -- and the United States has been drawn into the fray. But Beijing, which prefers to tackle the disputes bilaterally, has reacted angrily to Washington's involvement in the matter, accusing the U.S. State Department of ""unfounded accusations"" and showing a ""total disregard of facts."" At the joint news conference with Clinton on Wednesday, Yang took a more diplomatic tack, saying that ""freedom of navigation and safety in the South China Sea is assured."" But even while Clinton was in Beijing, the Chinese government was maintaining a heated diplomatic back-and-forth on another territorial controversy, this one concerning a set of small islands in the East China Sea also claimed by Japan and Taiwan. The uninhabited islands are known in Japan as Senkaku and in China as Diaoyu, and are privately owned by a Japanese family. Interactive: Asia's disputed islands - who claims what? Some Japanese media outlets reported Wednesday that the Japanese government had agreed to buy the islands from the family, a claim the government's chief Cabinet secretary, Osamu Fujimura, declined to confirm, saying talks on the matter were continuing. But that was enough to prompt a stern response from Hong Lei, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman. ""I want to emphasize again that any unilateral actions taken by the Japanese regarding the Diaoyu Islands are illegal and invalid,"" he said. ""We are closely monitoring the developments and will take necessary measures to defend our territorial sovereignty,"" Hong added. Furious anti-Japan protests erupted across China last month when a Japanese group sailed to one of the disputed islets and symbolically waved Japanese flags. And China doesn't seem eager for the United States to get involved in the quarrel. The Global Times, a Chinese newspaper affiliated with the ruling Communist Party, said in an editorial published Tuesday that Clinton's diplomacy in the region ""has fomented frictions between China and some surrounding countries."" It called on her to ""reflect upon the deep harm she is bringing to the Sino-US relationship."" More: Islands dispute reopens old wounds . In reality, Clinton is pressing China on hot-button issues like the territorial disputes, human rights and trade. But at the same time, she is seeking China's cooperation on such diplomatic headaches as Syria, Iran and North Korea. Both the Chinese and the U.S. camps sought to play down the cancellation of Clinton's meeting with Vice President Xi on Wednesday, saying he had also called off meetings with other foreign officials. Chinese officials said Xi would send a letter to Clinton. Instead of Xi, Clinton met Vice Premier Li Keqiang, who is widely expected to take over from Wen Jiabao as premier at the end of the leadership transition early next year. A meeting with Xi or Li is significant -- at least symbolically -- because they are widely expected to succeed the current leaders at a once-a-decade leadership change later this year. In the coming years, U.S.-China relations are expected to remain contentious. As the United States shifts more of its focus back to the Asia-Pacific region, Beijing suspects that the Washington is trying to contain China's rise as a global power. Clinton has tried to reassure China about the matter. ""Both President Obama and I have said frequently that the United States welcomes the rise of a strong, prosperous and peaceful China,"" she said Wednesday. ""We want China to succeed in delivering economic opportunity to its people, which will have a positive impact on the global economy. We want China to play a greater role in world affairs that strengthens global stability and helps solve urgent challenges."" The territorial disputes over islands in the South China Sea complicate that role. Countries like Vietnam and the Philippines lay claim to some areas of the sea, a 1.3 million-square-mile patch of the Pacific Ocean dotted with hundreds of largely uninhabited islands and coral atolls. But China has declared ""indisputable sovereignty"" over large swaths of the area, which is rich in marine life. The stakes are raised further by estimates that potentially huge reserves of natural gas and oil lie underneath the seabed. The potential for conflict was demonstrated in April when a Philippine Navy vessel confronted Chinese fishing boats in a remote rocky outcrop claimed by both countries. Opinion: Why Asia is arguing over its islands . The resulting naval standoff between the two countries lasted for more than three months and aroused fears of an open conflict before the Philippines withdrew its ships in June, citing stormy weather. The issue of who the lagoon belongs to remains unresolved. Analysts have expressed pessimism that the disputes in the South China Sea will be defused soon. ""While the likelihood of major conflict remains low, all of the trends are in the wrong direction, and prospects of resolution are diminishing,"" the International Crisis Group said in a July report. CNN's Jaime FlorCruz and Chi-Chi Zhang in Beijing, and Jethro Mullen in Hong Kong contributed to this report.","Secretary of State Hillary Clinton received a hostile welcome from the Chinese media .

"(CNN) -- This week, California again proved itself to be the nation's bellwether state when Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law that keeps children and teens under the age of 18 from possibly ruining their future with impulsive mistakes they make online. The landmark bill, supported by Common Sense Media, offers protection in two important ways. It requires all websites, online services and mobile apps where a California minor is registered to have an ""eraser button"" that lets children and teens remove information that they posted and shouldn't have -- giving them a chance to recover after posting information about themselves or others that they regret. It also prohibits websites, online services and mobile apps directed at minors from marketing certain dangerous goods or services. As the recent National Security Agency revelations have made clear, each of us leaves a dense trail of digital footprints online. At long last, concern is growing about protecting everyone's privacy. But it's a concern especially for children and teens, who so often reveal before they reflect. Unfortunately, our laws haven't kept up with our technology. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act was first enacted in 1998 when Mark Zuckerberg was in grade school. Although recent updates clearly enhance protection for information that websites collect from children under 13, they don't apply to teens, who are often more prone to impulsive mistakes. California's Senate Bill 568 is the first of its kind. At Common Sense Media, we see it as part of a larger national trend. In fact, a similar federal bill, known as the ""Do Not Track Kids Act,"" is expected to be introduced soon. It's a bipartisan effort led by Sen. Edward Markey and Rep. Joe Barton that includes an eraser button provision. An Allstate/National Journal Heartland Monitor poll released in June found that nine out of 10 Americans believe their personal information is less private than previous generations, and 93% believe that the next generation will have even less privacy. But kids are waking up. Last year, Common Sense Media published a study that found some young people yearn for the days before sharing everything on social media was commonplace. It even found that digital natives -- those who grew up digital -- actually prefer face-to-face interactions over Facebook. Of course, eight out of 10 teens use social media, according to a Pew study. The only glimmer of hope is that our children realize there's a cost to having tech giants and intelligence agents compile a detailed profile of them as they are evolving into the people they aspire to be. The explosive growth of digital devices, smartphones and social media is transforming our children's lives, in school and at home, with teachers, parents, friends and even strangers. Even the youngest are migrating online, using tablets and smartphones, and downloading apps. These new high-tech tools bring a wonderful potential for learning, communicating and creating -- as well as the potential for our children's personal information to be widely visible. Consider this: By the time they're 2, more than 90% of all American children have an online history. At 5 years old, more than 50% regularly interact with a computer or tablet device; and by 7 or 8, many children have cell phones and regularly play video games. Today's middle schoolers spend more time with media than with their parents or teachers; teenagers text an average of 3,000 times a month. Every little bit of data contained in the touch of a keystroke or the press of a ""like"" button contributes to an opus of that child's life -- often revealing details and drawing conclusions about him or her that could have ramifications for years to come. Children deserve to write their own stories, star in their own movies and discover their own dreams; they deserve at least a modicum of privacy as they grow and discover their true selves, regardless of what they text or tweet, or where they go on the Internet. But for these positive outcomes to happen, we must confront the privacy challenges in our 24/7 digital world. We need legislation, educational efforts and norms that reflect 21st-century realities to maximize the opportunities and minimize the risks for our youth. Then we will be able to give them the safe, healthy childhood and adolescence they deserve. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Steyer.","California law lets children under the age of 18 delete online posts they regret .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- A fisherman who was hospitalized after becoming ill while cleaning up oil in the Gulf of Mexico has filed a temporary restraining order in federal court against oil company BP. John Wunstell Jr., is asking BP to give the workers masks and not harass workers who publicly voice their health concerns. Wunstell, a shrimper, said he was paid by BP to use his boat, Ramie's Wish, to clean up oil that has been gushing into the Gulf since an oil rig sank about 40 miles off the Louisiana coast, gushing an estimated 19,000 barrels (798, 000 gallons) of crude a day. In an affidavit, Wunstell wrote he started experiencing severe headaches and nasal irritation on May 24. Over the next few days, he also developed nosebleeds, an upset stomach, and aches. On Friday, Wunstell was airlifted to West Jefferson Medical Center in Marrero, Louisiana, where he remained hospitalized Sunday. Eight other workers were brought to the hospital this week and were all released. ""We need to start protecting these guys,"" said Jim Klick, Wunstell's lawyer. In his affidavit, Wunstell described his experience at the hospital. ""At West Jefferson, there were tents set up outside the hospital, where I was stripped of my clothing, washed with water and several showers, before I was allowed into the hospital,"" Wunstell said. ""When I asked for my clothing, I was told that BP had confiscated all of my clothing and it would not be returned."" The restraining order requests that BP refrain from ""altering, testing or destroying clothing or any other evidence or potential evidence"" when workers become ill. Graham MacEwen, a spokesman for BP, said he could not comment on the restraining order, or on allegations that BP confiscated clothing. He denied accusations from Clint Guidry, president of the Louisiana Shrimpers Association, that BP has been threatening workers who speak out about health concerns. Fishermen contacted by CNN have declined to speak publicly. Some, who are making as much as $3,000 a day cleaning up the oil, have said they fear losing their jobs with BP. ""The BP oil spill wiped out their professions and their jobs this year and possibly years down the road,"" Klick said. ""The only work they can get right now is with BP."" The BP spokesman said there have been no threats against workers for speaking out. ""If they have any concerns, they should raise them with their supervisors,"" MacEwen said. ""They can also call the joint information center and make complaints anonymously."" Wunstell is one of nine clean-up workers who were sent to the hospital with symptoms such as shortness of breath, nose and throat irritation, headaches, and dizziness. The restraining order requests that BP stop using dispersants without providing ""appropriate personal protective equipment"" to workers. Corexit, a dispersant, is being sprayed into the Gulf to break down the oil. The safety data information sheet from the manufacturer states that people should ""avoid breathing in vapor"" from Corexit, and that masks should be work when Corexit is present in certain concentrations in the air. BP has not supplied workers with masks when they work near the oil and dispersants. ""We're been carrying out very extensive air quality since early on in this exercise, to make sure that we have working safe conditions, and thus far not found situations where there are air quality concerns that would require face masks,"" MacEwen said. He added that workers who want to wear masks are ""free to do so"" as long as they receive instructions from their supervisors on how to use them. According to Guidry from the shrimpers' association, BP told workers they were not allowed to wear masks. ""Some of our men asked, and they were told they'd be fired if they wore masks,"" he said. Tony Hayward, the chief executive officer of BP, offered another explanation for the fishermen's illness: spoiled food. ""Food poisoning is clearly a big issue,"" Hayward said Sunday. ""It's something we've got to be very mindful of. It's one of the big issues of keeping the Army operating. You know, the Army marches on their stomachs."" An expert on foodborne illness cast doubt on Hayward's theory. ""Headaches, shortness of breath, nosebleeds -- there's nothing there that suggests foodborne illness,"" said Dr. Michael Osterholm, a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health. ""I don't know what these people have, but it sounds more like a respiratory illness."" -- CNN's Jennifer Bixler contributed to this report .","Order asks BP from destroying evidence taken from ill workers .

"(CNN) -- Legislation providing for government-funded contraception and sex education classes in the Philippines will take effect in mid-January, according to a spokeswoman for President Benigno Aquino. Aquino signed the bill on December 21, deputy presidential spokeswoman Abigail Valte said in a statement released Saturday. Lawmakers nearly two weeks ago approved the legislation, and a reconciliation committee was tasked with working out differences in the versions passed by the two houses. Despite widespread popular support, the Catholic Church opposed the measure, saying it will destroy marriage and morality in the Philippines. More than 80% of the Philippines' 96 million residents are Catholic. Passage of the bill closed a divisive chapter in the country's history, said Valte, according to the official Philippines News Agency. The act ""opens the possibility of cooperation and reconciliation among different sectors in society: engagement and dialogue characterized not by animosity, but by our collective desire to better the welfare of the Filipino people,"" she said. Read one senator's opinion: 'Why we fought' Sen. Edgardo Angara, who voted for the measure, called the bill ""an affirmation of human rights,"" according to CNN affiliate ABS-CBN.

"(CNN) -- Dustin Johnson clinched the opening PGA Tour title of 2013 after holding off a final round challenge from fellow American Steve Stricker at the Tournament of Champions in Hawaii. The season's curtain-raiser pitted 30 winners from 2012 against each other, but play was delayed by three days as high winds and torrential rain battered the Kapalua resort and caused the event to be reduced to just three rounds. World No. 12 Johnson, three shots clear of defending champion Stricker heading into the final day, carded a five-under-par 68 to finish 16 under for tournament. Stricker, one place behind Johnson in the world rankings, had a putt to draw level with Johnson at the 13th but he missed and his rival carded an eagle at the 14th to move into an unassailable four-stroke lead. ""It gives me a lot of confidence going into this year,"" Johnson told the Tour's official website after becoming the first player since Tiger Woods to win a PGA Tour title in each of his first six seasons out of college. Stricker started the day in confident mood, but his slip at the 13th proved decisive as he eventually finished 12 under following a bogey-free round of 69. ""I actually thought, as we started the round today, I could really put some serious pressure on this guy because I'm going to hit first every time to the green,"" said the 45-year-old, who is 90 under for his last 20 rounds at the Hawaii course. ""I had an opportunity, which is why we play is to have that opportunity to try to win. I had some chances today. ""I had some chances to put some pressure on early. Missed some putts there early in the round that could have made a difference, maybe not, but who knows-type thing."" Johnson and Stricker's 2012 U.S. Ryder Cup teammate Brandt Snedeker carded a 69 to finish 10 under, one shot clear of reigning Masters champion Bubba Watson (71) and 2011 PGA Championship winner Keegan Bradley (70). World No. 31 Rickie Fowler finished on eight under after a stunning six-under-par 67. The American was forced to start the tournament three times after wind halted his first two attempts. Englishman Ian Poulter, one of the heroes of Europe's remarkable comeback victory against the U.S. in the September's Ryder Cup, finished five under after closing with a 69. The 2012 PGA Championship winner Webb Simpson was four under for the following a final round 71.","Dustin Johnson finishes 16 under to clinch weather-effected Tournament of Champions .

"(CNN) -- Patience is finally paying off for Dustin Johnson. One of the most naturally gifted golfers in the world, he feels he is now closer to fulfilling his promise after clinching the ""biggest win"" of his career in circumstances that might previously have proved too testing. The big-hitting 29-year-old claimed the $1.2 million first prize at the HSBC Champions in Shanghai on Sunday, winning his first World Golf Championships title by three shots after a sizzling finish. Next, he hopes, is the holy grail of any player -- a win at one of the four majors. ""This is the biggest win of my career and hopefully there are better things to come. A major is always the next step,"" the American told reporters. ""Am I suited best for one or the other? I don't think so. I think they all suit me very well. If I play like I did this week, I'm going to win one for sure. ""I grew up right down the street from Augusta (venue for April's Masters), so that would be my favorite one. I just love playing that golf course."" Johnson has already gone close twice, having led by three shots going into the final round of the 2010 U.S. Open before blowing up and then missing out on a playoff at the following year's PGA Championship after getting a two-shot penalty at the last hole. In China, where he was chased by defending champion Ian Poulter and Graeme McDowell -- the man who overhauled him to win at Pebble Beach three years ago -- he also had a three-shot lead. But it was gone inside two holes as he three-putted his first and Poulter began with two birdies. However, Johnson is mentally stronger these days and he tussled for the lead with Poulter before chipping in for an eagle at 16 that put him two clear of the Englishman, and then picking up another shot at 17 before parring the final hole -- which he had double-bogeyed on Saturday. ""It takes a while to learn,"" Johnson said of his newfound maturity, having carded a second successive six-under-par 66 to clinch his second PGA Tour title this year and first of the new 2013-14 season. ""I wish I would have had some of that a few times a few years ago, but you learn from your mistakes and try to get better from them. ""I think I showed a lot of patience and a lot of discipline with clubs I picked and shot selection."" Poulter, who also closed with 66 after a 63 on Saturday, moved up to fourth in the European Tour's Race to Dubai standings -- WGC events, like majors, count for points on both main circuits. ""I guess it was a good defense,"" the 37-year-old said. ""Obviously I'm a little disappointed not to put my hands back on the trophy, but 15 birdies and an eagle at the weekend is some pretty good golf. ""I'm in great form. I really am playing well. The work I've done leading up to this run of tournaments has really worked and I couldn't be hitting it any better right now."" McDowell was third, another shot back on 20-under 268, as he trimmed Henrik Stenson's Race to Dubai lead ahead of next week's third event in the final series in Turkey. The Swede, who won the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup in September, finished tied for 31st at Sheshan International after a closing 65. McDowell paid tribute to Johnson, who is a key member of the U.S. Ryder Cup team. ""Dustin was in a different league off the tee and gave us a little bit of a sniff -- and then promptly slammed the door,"" the Northern Irishman said. ""He's just a quality, talented, very athletic, classy player. Yeah, he makes mistakes. But when you've got a game as good as him, you can get away with a few mistakes. He's got a great wedge game to go with an outrageously good driving game."" Spain's Sergio Garcia was fourth on 18 under after shooting the day's equal-best round, a flawless nine-birdie 63. U.S. Open champion Justin Rose was two shots back after a 68, just ahead of former world No. 1 Rory McIlroy and Canada's Graham DeLaet (both 69). Bubba Watson and Martin Kaymer were tied for eighth with Jamie Donaldson, just ahead of Ernie Els, Keegan Bradley and Boo Weekley in 11th equal. American veteran Phil Mickelson was 14th after the British Open titleholder carded 65.","Dustin Johnson wins the WGC-HSBC Champions tournament by three strokes Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Newt Gingrich's immigration plan could be a breakthrough moment for conservatives. It could be a new kind of signal from conservatives that we are not bound in an absolutist straitjacket when it comes to immigration reform. First and foremost, Gingrich's solution to illegal immigration is not amnesty. His plan would create a narrow and demanding path to legality, not to full citizenship. According to his ""21st Century Contract with America,"" solving America's immigration problem would begin with full control of the border by January 1, 2014. All government resources necessary would be made available for this, including ""round-the-clock drone flights"" and ""multi-layer, strategic fencing in urban areas."" Additionally, Gingrich's plan would reform the legal visa system, offer incentives for the best brains in the world to come to America (with H1-B skilled work visas), develop a legal guest-worker program run by corporations outside of the government, and make English the official language of government. A majority of conservatives agree with these reforms. Where they differ right now is on Gingrich's plan for legality for the illegal immigrants already in the country. Gingrich's call for a ""humane"" immigration policy in last Tuesday's CNN debate sounded too much like amnesty to many conservatives. But a closer look at Gingrich's plan might change minds. Gingrich's immigration plan would only grant legality, not full citizenship, to anyone who has entered the country illegally should they meet stringent requirements. Anyone with a criminal record would be ineligible and subject to deportation, as well as those who entered the country recently and have no commercial or family ties to the United States. Only those who can sustain themselves without government assistance (Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) and pay for their own private health insurance would be eligible to stay. An independent, local ""citizen's review"" board would grant legal status based on the requirements above as well as the immigrant's standing in his or her community. Should they be permitted to stay, they will still be subject to a $5,000 penalty. Gingrich's plan is strict and nuanced. But more importantly, it could be a sign of a new conservative philosophy. As he said in the debate, ""I do not believe that the people of the United States are going to take people who have been here a quarter century, who have children and grandchildren, who are members of the community, who may have done something 25 years ago, separate them from their families, and expel them."" Some of Gingrich's fellow GOP presidential contenders seized on this statement and used it against him. Michele Bachmann called his plan amnesty and said it would give 11 million illegal immigrants a free pass. Campaigning in Iowa after the CNN debate, Gov. Mitt Romney was also quick to call Gingrich's plan amnesty. Other prominent conservatives, like Iowa's Rep. Steve King, bristled at Gingrich's plan, saying it would be another magnet or incentive for illegal immigrants to enter the country and set up a family. Now that Gingrich is a legitimate frontrunner in the GOP presidential race his plan will be fully vetted, as it should be. There are some legitimate concerns. How big is this group of illegal immigrants we're talking about? If Gingrich's plan would legalize 1 million, and the actual problem is 10-15 million, it's not much of a solution. How can an illegal immigrant have stayed here 25 years legally without having broken additional laws such as filing taxes with a false social security number or receiving welfare without being eligible? Another question: Why not just focus on enforcement first? Once it is achieved, Americans would be much more open to additional reforms and possible accommodations. Despite these serious and consequential objections, Gingrich has the nation's attention right now and should use this moment to offer a full, detailed explanation of his immigration plan to the American people. It is not a perfect, comprehensive plan, but it's a starting point and moves the conversation in the right direction. Conservatives have long been victim to the liberal argument that they would mass deport all illegal immigrants. Gingrich offers a serious alternative that needs to be debated.

"San Diego (CNN) -- In November 2008, after an ugly campaign that stirred emotions and split families along generational lines, California voters narrowly approved Proposition 8. The ballot initiative defined marriage as between a man and a woman and banned same-sex marriage in the Golden State. Now, as the Supreme Court hears arguments from those challenging the law's constitutionality, we Californians have a message for the rest of the country: ""Oops. Never mind."" A new Field Poll, released at the end of February, provides the evidence of what many of us here on the left coast have been sensing over the last 4Â½ years: When it comes to same-sex marriage, many California voters want a do-over. The survey shows that 61% of California voters now approve of it, with 32% opposed. The ""pro"" figure represents a big jump from 2008 when the Field Poll showed that 51% of California voters approved of same sex-marriage. It's part of what has been a gradual march toward greater public acceptance of same-sex marriage in a state that has struggled with this issue like no other in recent memory. I know this struggle. I went through it myself. Thirteen years ago, I opposed same-sex marriage and supported the watered-down alternative -- civil unions. As a practical matter, I thought activists should focus on things such as a federal civil rights bill outlawing private-sector discrimination due to sexual orientation. Then a gay family member helped me see the light. I now understand that we can't have a two-tiered system, where some of us enjoy the right to marry and our brothers and sisters and cousins don't, based solely on sexual orientation. Opinion: Straight marriage is the real issue . California's struggle started about the same time. In 2000, another ballot initiative -- Proposition 22, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman -- was approved by 61% of California voters. Note that this is the same percentage that, in the current Field Poll, says they now support same-sex marriage. A lot can happen in 13 years. A state can turn itself inside out in 13 years. When the California Supreme Court struck down Proposition 22 as inconsistent with the state constitution, opponents of gay marriage got crafty and proposed another initiative -- Proposition 8, which went so far as to amend the state constitution to ban same-sex marriage. California voters approved the measure, 52% to 48% -- and in doing so, betrayed their own liberal reputation. Share your reaction to the arguments . Think of the irony. On the very same day that a majority of voters in this dark blue state voted for the nation's first African-American president, a majority also approved a ballot initiative that winked at bigotry. Worse, supporters of the measure included a majority of Hispanic and African-American voters. They're no stranger to discrimination, and so they should know better. Maybe many of these voters of color got swept up in the same wave of fear and ignorance that swept across the rest of the state's population. I live in California, and so I saw it all play out. It wasn't pretty. For instance, there were, in the final days of the campaign, a despicable series of ""Yes on 8"" radio and television ads that took full advantage of bigotry's old buddy -- fear. One of the main messages behind these ads was that, if same-sex marriage were legal, it would somehow creep its way into the public schools through the curriculum. Opinion: The real 'modern family' in America . I remember one television ad that showed a little girl who hurried home from school and excitedly told her mother that she was reading a book about a prince who didn't marry a princess because he settled on marrying another prince. And so, she said with a big smile, when she grew up, she could marry a princess. The mother reacted with a panicked look. The spot did not make clear that California parents have the right to be notified if sexually explicit material is being taught and to pull their children out of class if they choose. Those are the facts. But, as we have learned time and again, fear doesn't listen to facts. But the good news is that fear usually loses its strength over time. And that is what happened here. And it happened here, across the board. In the new Field Poll for California, 64% of African-Americans and Asian-Americans and 56% of Hispanics now support same-sex marriage. No one can say definitively why the numbers have shifted in California. But the change of heart does seem to mirror a national trend where -- as more Americans discover or acknowledge that they have gays and lesbians among their friends and family -- their attitude toward same-sex marriage seems to be softening. A new CNN/ORC International Survey found evidence of something that analysts are calling the ""Rob Portman effect,"" in reference to the Republican senator from Ohio who changed his position on same-sex marriage after learning his son is gay. In the poll, 57% of Americans now say that they have a family member or close friend who is gay or lesbian. That's a 12-point gain since 2007. Meanwhile, over that same time period, the number of Americans who support same-sex marriage has gone up by almost exactly the same percentage. Opinion: Our journey with the Clintons on gay rights . This is either one heck of a coincidence or evidence that people come to support same-sex marriage as the issue begins to hit closer to home and they become aware that someone they care about is gay or lesbian. Whatever is causing the shift, in California and throughout the United States, let's be thankful for it. The Supreme Court will be taking a close look at California's Proposition 8, and it is expected to hand down its ruling in June. Speaking of this issue being close to home for many of us, among those attending the arguments will be Chief Justice John Roberts' lesbian cousin who lives in California. But, frankly, whatever the high court decides isn't all that important anymore. Because, closer to home, many Californians have already admitted their mistake. And soon, they'll be looking for a way to correct it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Ruben Navarrette: California voted in 2008 to ban same-sex marriage .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Spain's King Juan Carlos was recovering Friday after being readmitted to a Madrid hospital for surgery on his right hip, the Royal Palace said. An update on the 74-year-old king's condition is expected later in the day, according to the palace. The surgery was performed Thursday at San Jose Hospital to ""reduce a dislocation"" of the hip, a palace statement said. He underwent hip replacement surgery earlier this month after falling while on a controversial private hunting trip in Botswana. The African trip caused an outcry in Spain and abroad for its expense during the nation's economic crisis and for including the hunting of elephants. Last week, the king made a rare apology over the trip, saying he had made a mistake which would not happen again. Spaniards generally hold the king in high regard for his service to the nation and his defense of democracy after the death of the dictator Francisco Franco in 1975 -- especially the king's decisive stand to halt a right-wing military coup in 1981. But after news emerged of the expensive hunting trip, with widespread Spanish media reports that it included the hunting of elephants, even normally-staunch political allies of the monarch said publicly that they considered the timing of the trip a mistake. The criticism of the trip initially focused on the expensive safari in the midst of the nation's deep crisis, with 23% unemployment, 5 million Spaniards out of work, and the government applying austerity cuts and tax increases to make up for budget shortfalls. The king himself had previously expressed his concern over the impact of the crisis on Spaniards and called on the nation to come together to get through the tough times. The royal household has a budget of 8.26 million euros ($10.8 million) this year, 2% less than last year, and had recently announced cuts of about $222,000, including trimming salaries of the highest-paid staffers at the royal palace. Some critics also wondered how much public money was spent for security on the king's private trip. Animal rights activists also voiced criticism, as reports emerged that the king was hunting elephants. At least one photo, said to be from an earlier trip, showed the king, rifle in hand, standing in front of a dead elephant. It was widely published in Spanish media, which said it was taken from the website of an African safari outfitter, and that the photo was later removed from the company's site. CNN's Al Goodman contributed to this report.","King Juan Carlos is readmitted to a hospital in Madrid for surgery on his hip .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Spanish unions were making final preparations for a general strike Thursday to protest the new conservative government's labor reforms and austerity cuts. It will be the first general strike against the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, which was elected in November and took office in December, in the midst of Spain's deep economic crisis. Leaders of the two main unions -- the Socialist-leaning General Workers Union (UGT) and the Communist-leaning Workers Commissions (CCOO) -- were due in Madrid's central Puerta del Sol plaza late Wednesday to meet with union picketers who will then spread out across the capital, while other picketers fan out across the nation. The unions are expected to try to disrupt public transportation and major industry in the early hours of the strike, either through workers staying off the job or through informational picketers who will noisily greet people trying to go to work and ask them to join the strike. The last general strike, in September 2010, was against the then-Socialist government, which also had initiated austerity measures. That strike slowed industry and transport, but much of the country went to work and many analysts saw it as a kind of a draw between the government and unions. Since then, the economic crisis has deepened. Spain's jobless rate is nearly 23% overall, and nearly 50% for youth. Nearly 5.3 million Spaniards are out of work. Union protests across the nation this month and last drew large crowds, which analysts say emboldened the unions to move ahead with a general strike. The government says the latest labor reforms are needed to bring flexibility to the workplace and to simplify the rules for employers. But unions say the effect will be to make it easier and cheaper to fire workers. The unions' strike theme is: ""They want to end labor and social rights and finish off everything."" At the MercaMadrid wholesale fish market, one of the largest in Europe, seafood wholesaler Alfonso Mozos, who employs 120 people, said he doesn't think striking is good. ""It would be better if unions, the government and employers would negotiate and find a solution,"" he said. Union picketers are expected at the entrance to the sprawling market on Madrid's south side, but some employees say they plan to work despite the strike. ""If the boss buys fish and we need to come, we'll come,"" said Pedro Marin, a worker at the wholesale market. ""But if the union pickets outside won't let us in, we'll just have to wait, or maybe go home."" Many other Spaniards, who have already seen their salaries cut or frozen in the economic crisis, were debating whether to strike. If they walk out, they will lose a day's wage, which for government workers could amount to several hundred dollars. Unions and government officials in many, but not all, of Spain's 17 regions have agreed on minimum services, which generally call for about 30% of public transportation to run, while public hospitals and other essential services would have reduced staff, similar to holiday levels. The unions also plan 80 demonstrations across the country on Thursday, mostly in the late afternoon or eary evening. The strike comes one day before the government unveils its 2012 budget on Friday, with the aim of reducing Spain's deficit to 5.3% of gross domestic product this year, and to 3% next year, to meet European Union requirements. The government already approved a $20 billion (15 billion euro) package of austerity cuts and tax hikes to reduce the deficit, and on Friday it is expected to announce a second package of the same size or larger. Government critics say it will be the first time the government really shows its hand on where to make deep cuts in specific programs and agencies. Rajoy, at a recent European Union summit, was reported by Spanish media to be overheard on an open microphone telling another EU leader that the labor reforms would cost him a general strike. The reforms were approved first as a decree law, with immediate effect, and the unions called on the government to make amendments as the bill moved through parliament. But the conservatives have a commanding majority in parliament and later approved the reforms unchanged. The government says the labor reforms make up only a portion of the elements needed to spur an economic recovery. It predicts a 1.7% decline in the economy this year. The government also has demanded reforms in the banking sector, with the aim of getting credit flowing again and to clean up the books of lenders stuck with huge uncollectible debts left over from Spain's real estate and construction boom that went bust, precipitating the economic crisis.","Spain's unions called for a general strike Thursday .

"(CNN) -- There's learning to read, and then there's loving to read. As the end of the school year approaches, parents are stockpiling ideas to keep their children on top of those long summer reading lists. But how? Bestselling novelist and renowned nonfiction writer Anna Quindlen raised three avid readers who are also a big part of her work. Her eldest son, Quin Krovatin, now 29, helped research and write her 2004 travelogue, ""Imagined London,"" and her fun and foibles as a parent found their way into her other writing, without exposing too many details about them. (""Books and columns come and go, but your kids are there forever,"" she said.) Quindlen recently took some time on her tour to promote her new novel, ""Still Life with Bread Crumbs,"" to offer some guidance on raising kids who are passionate about reading. It's never too early to read to children -- and don't stop . Quindlen and her husband, Gerald Krovatin, started reading to their three kids from the start. ""We read to them from the time they were very little,"" she said. When Quin was 5, he showed his mother just how much the reading message hit home. ""I took him for a school interview, which is a horrid rite of passage in Manhattan. And the interviewer came out and said, 'And how long has he been reading?' And I said, 'Oh he can't read. He's only in kindergarten.' And she said, 'No, he reads.' I thought, 'Oh I'm the world's worst mother.' "" She laughed, and continued: ""I said, 'Quin? You can read?' He sort of shook his head. And I said, 'Why didn't you tell me?' And he said, 'Because I was afraid you wouldn't read to me anymore.' ""So I told him then that I would read to him forever."" Just because your children can read, doesn't mean they don't want to share books with their parents. Sharing ""Harry Potter"" with your children can be even more fun than reading it alone the first time. Make reading the reward . Once kids can read by themselves, present books as a treat, rather than a task. Even if their teachers ask them to read at home for 20 minutes a day after school, urge your children to read for an hour or more -- by choice. "" 'All right, if you're good tonight, you can read for a half an hour after you get into bed.' If you make reading seem like castor oil, it's no surprise that your kids won't want to do it. If you make it seem like chocolate pudding and a milkshake combined, they will be thrilled to do it,"" Quindlen said. Be a model reader . The more you read yourself, the more children will yearn to read often, too. Fill your home with books, whether on tablets or tables, and make sure your kids see you reading, and enjoying it. Quindlen said her three children grew up seeing their mother behind a book so often that they might ask: "" 'What does mom's face look like when there's not a book in front of it? Does anyone remember?' "" Be the reader you want your children to become. Match books to children's interests ... Take advantage of the wide range of books for children. Quindlen advises, ""If you have a boy who is an indefatigable jock, don't give him 'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.' That's not his book. Give him Jane Leavy's biography of Sandy Koufax. Or give him some great young adult novel about a baseball team. Once you know who your kids are, you've got to pick out the books that are right for them."" Other reading experts agree that getting children excited about reading involves knowing them well, and choosing books that cater to their interests. ""One of the best ways to inspire children to read is to help them find books that speak to them as individuals, so that reading isn't this isolated, fraught activity that they do at school,"" says Victoria Ford Smith, an assistant professor at the University of Connecticut who specializes in children's literature. ""It's an infinitely fertile field to be in."" Ford teaches Roald Dahl's books to undergraduates at the University of Connecticut, and cites the author who wrote ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", ""Matilda,"" and many others as one of her favorites. For children who are accustomed to having adults make all of the decisions about their lives, Dahl's stories are a refreshing escape. ""He really turns the tables on who has the power in his books,"" she said. ""Usually it's children who are powerful, and adults who are ridiculous."" Try something different for parents and kids . From Dahl, to Sendak, to Dr. Seuss and others, young readers are spoiled for choice. There's a reason why Dr. Seuss in particular gets a nationwide celebration -- or Seussibration, for those in the know -- on his birthday, March 2: He created a niche with his wacky characters, and accessible writing style. ""It's a really simple vocabulary; it's easy to begin to read, if you're a beginning reader, but (the books) still have a really great sense of humor,"" said Madigan McGillicuddy, a children's librarian in Atlanta. ""There is so much packed in there that builds a lifetime love of reading."" Children's books have come a long way since the days of ""Dick and Jane,"" which seem a bit stilted next to what's on today's bookshelves. Now, most children's books have intricate illustrations, and wildly imaginative plots. ""What mostly attracts me to children's literature is how complex it is,"" Ford said. ""We often have a misconception that children's literature is literature for adults with simpler language, and happy endings."" Really, children's literature brings their fears and frustrations to life. Ford cited Maurice Sendak's ""Where the Wild Things Are,"" about a boy who gets sent to bed without his supper, but can imagine a world where he rules a land of wild giants. For parents, revisiting favorite stories from their own childhoods can engage them in reading along with their kids, and inspire them to beg for the next book. As Quindlen said, ""I made it seem like reading was the greatest thing since sliced bread because that's how I feel."" By the end of the summer, parents and kids who follow her advice might feel the same way. Which books made you want to read more as a child?

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic has had plenty to say about the blue clay at the Madrid Masters and he was in no mood to change his mind after a minor scare on his first competitive outing on the new surface. The world No. 1 thought the players should have been consulted on Madrid's decision to depart from the traditional red clay and the Serbian cut a frustrated figure as he beat Spanish qualifier Daniel Gimeno-Traver 6-2 3-6 6-2. ""It's impossible to move,"" he was quoted as telling reporters by AFP. ""I hit maybe five balls, the rest went just trying to put the ball into the court. ""I was relying on serve and getting free points from his unforced errors. That was not tennis, either I need football shoes or some advice on how to play on this court. ""I cannot find the words to describe this court. It's really tough to play like this on a center court. We need serious discussion about the future of this blue clay. ""We cannot change anything this year, but my first impressions are not good. I don't want to be the one complaining, but I say honestly what I feel."" Djokovic's victory was his first outing since he lost to Rafael Nadal in the Monte Carlo Masters and his win set up a third round clash with either Jurgen Melzer or Stanislas Wawrinka. No. 6 seed Tomas Berdych, from the Czech Republic, defeated South Africa's Kevin Anderson 6-4 6-3 while Aregntina's Juan Martin Del Potro, who won the Estoril Open last week, toppled Florian Mayer 6-4 6-2. There were also victories for French trio Gilles Simon, Gael Monfils and Richard Gasquet. In the women's draw the top two seeds, Victoria Azarenka and Maria Sharapova, both made it safely into round three. Azarenka, the world No. 1, beat the Czech Republic's Andrea Hlavackova 6-3 7-6 before having her say on the blue clay surface. ""The surface is a bit slippery, but it's the same for all of us,"" the Belarusian told reporters. ""I don't like to complain -- it is what it is and it won't change now."" Sharapova, striving to complete a major slam with victory at the French Open later this month, also toppled a Czech opponent, Klara Zakopalova 6-4 6-3. ""It's not so much about the color,"" she told a press conference. ""It does look good on television. But it plays a bit different. ""It's about the amount of clay on the court and the way it bounces. I got settled in so it's just a matter of adjusting. It's also the same for everyone."" Serbian Ana Ivanovic, the No. 13 seed, also made it into round three after beating Nadia Petrova, from Russia, 7-5 6-1.","Novak Djokovic unhappy with Madrid's blue clay surface after second-round win .

"(CNN) -- In middle school, a lot of kids think it's cool to cuss and toss around four-letter words like a soccer ball at recess. McKay Hatch, 16, launched an initiative to curb the use of profanity. But when McKay Hatch was in eighth grade, he called foul on the cussing he heard. Hatch started the No Cussing Club. It began at his school and then, through his Web site, attracted members of all ages from all 50 states and 30 countries. His efforts even got the attention of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, which declared the first week of March ""No Cussing Week."" CNN's Nicole Lapin spoke to the 16-year-old about the recent success of his movement and the trials he overcame to start it. The following is an edited transcript of the interview. McKay Hatch: Actually, when I first went to my parents about the idea, my dad was kind of like, 'No, no, don't do this.' He knew I'd get bullied and teased, which I did, and more. I got a lot of death threats from people, but I realized that through this whole thing that these people were bullies and I wasn't going to let them win.  Watch the entire interview with McKay Hatch » . Nicole Lapin: Well, you received not only death threats we should say, McKay. Your site was hacked into, prostitutes were sent to your house. Were you ever scared by any of those threats? Hatch: At first I was actually pretty scared because they said, 'I know where you live.' Our address was posted online on a really big Web site and at first I was scared. But like I said, these are bullies and they wanted me to be scared and I wasn't going to let them win. Lapin: Even with the bullies, even with the threats, is this now in 30 different countries with thousands of members? Is it worth it? Hatch: It's definitely worth it. Now we have members in all 50 states and 30 countries. People are signing up with our Web site nocussing.com and they're taking the pledge to use language to uplift and make people feel good about themselves. That's what this whole club is. Lapin: It's not really about just cussing. It's also about civility. Hatch: Yeah, it's about talking to people with civility like you said, and making people feel good about themselves and talking to people with respect.

"Bogota, Colombia (CNN) -- Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos officially announced he will seek re-election, a decision that could affect the ongoing peace talks between the government and the FARC. ""You elected me to strengthen the results that we had achieved in security, and we have delivered,"" Santos said in a televised speech Wednesday night. Santos, who was first elected in 2010 on a platform of continuing an offensive against the leftist guerrillas that have been at war with the government for decades, instead followed a different path. The hallmark of his presidency now is the peace process between the government and the largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. The peace process has been ongoing for one year, with progress coming slowly. This approach is controversial in Colombia, which in the past has been burned by failed negotiation attempts. With a peace agreement unlikely to be in place before next year's presidential election, its chances of success could be foreshadowed by the vote. One of Santos' rivals for the presidency is Oscar Ivan Zuluaga, who has called for an end to the peace talks and is against giving a political space to the rebels. Zuluaga's proposal is backed by former President Alvaro Uribe, a former ally of Santos who now favors someone with a hardline stance against the guerrillas. Santos says he wants to be re-elected to finish the peace process he started. ""We still have big challenges, but I'm convinced that the way to confront them is not only through blood and fire,"" he said. Santos' current approval rating of about 30% means his incumbency will not guarantee him a second four-year term. ""He thinks that because of fragmentation among the political parties and that other political leaders also haven't consolidated supporters, he can be re-elected,"" political analyst Jaime Arango said. Santos placed all his political capital on the negotiations with the FARC, so it's natural that he is seeking re-election, another analyst, Vicente Torrijos, said. Seeking a second term was his only option given that the peace process is still underway, he said. ""So he is going to present himself to Colombians and the world as the peacemaker and of course this is his best calling card to aspire to this re-election,"" he said.

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Union protesters marched across Spain Sunday as mourners marked the eighth anniversary of the Madrid train bombings. The timing of the demonstrations prompted criticism from some conservative leaders, who accused Spain's two main unions of disrespecting victims of the 2004 attacks. But Pilar Manjon, a leader of the largest victims association, said she did not consider the marches disrespectful. ""They cannot use us to batter the unions, to dismiss them or to say they have no respect for the victims. ... (The protest) absolutely does not bother us,"" she told Spanish radio network SER. In response to criticisms, the unions have countered that some conservatives have shown a lack of respect for the victims -- which included many workers and students killed or maimed in the attacks -- by fomenting unfounded conspiracy theories about the bombings. Manjon, whose son was among the 191 people killed in the 2004 attacks, attended a memorial with union leaders at Madrid's Atocha train station. Nearby, at a grove of trees planted in honor of the victims in the Retiro Park, the Association of Victims of Terrorism held a memorial. Madrid's mayor and Spain's justice minister attended the ceremony, Spanish media reported. Spanish courts have convicted 14 Islamic militants for their roles in the 2004 bombings on morning rush-hour commuter trains, which injured more than 1,800 people. Four Spaniards were convicted for trafficking in explosives used in the attacks. Additionally, seven other prime Islamic suspects in the attacks blew themselves up three weeks after the train bombings as police closed in on their hideout in a Madrid suburb. That explosion also killed a police officer and wounded various others. Sunday's union protests prompted Madrid's regional government and Madrid's city hall, both governed by conservative administrations, to delay their annual observances until Monday. They will include a memorial ceremony in the Puerta del Sol, followed by a memorial in the monument to the victims at Atocha station. Spain's anniversary observances in recent years have been subdued, without the king or prime minister attending, and without speeches or music. Authorities have said that's in keeping with the wishes of the victims associations, who want the nation to remember, but without undue fanfare. But crowds of protesters sang, chanted and waved banners as they packed streets in Madrid, Seville, Bilbao and other cities Sunday. Spain's two main unions -- the Socialist-leaning General Workers Union (UGT) and the Communist-leaning Workers Commissions (CCOO) -- said they scheduled the demonstrations on the symbolic day to protest against the new conservative government's labor reforms, which unions say make it cheaper and easier to fire workers. ""We're here because this government doesn't offer any solutions. They're trying to take advantage of the crisis to cut back labor and social rights. We must oppose them democratically,"" said Candido Mendez, leader of the UGT. Spain's parliament approved the labor reforms last month. Government officials have argued that the measures will reduce unemployment and give workers more rights, such as an annual 20-hour paid leave for training. But unions have sharply criticized the reforms. Sunday's demonstrations follow union protests last month which drew large crowds nationwide. On Friday, the unions announced a general strike for March 29. Protester Rafael Serrano Rodriguez carried a poster showing scissors as he walked through Madrid Sunday, saying he opposed government pension cutbacks. Jose Maria Rey Gayo, a civil servant, said the government's labor market reforms were the most serious attack on worker rights since Spain's return to democracy 37 years ago. Spain's jobless rate is nearly 23% overall, and nearly 50% for youth. Nearly 5.3 million Spaniards are out of work and the government has announced deep austerity cuts.","A victim leader and union leaders attend a memorial marking the 2004 bombing anniversary .

"(CNN) -- A pair of siblings who served decades behind bars in the rape and murder of a North Carolina child will walk out of prison free men Wednesday after DNA evidence implicated someone else. Henry McCollum and Leon Brown were just teenagers when they were arrested in 1983 and charged with the rape and murder of 11-year-old Sabrina Buie in Red Springs, about 30 miles southeast of Fayetteville in rural Robeson County. Buie's body was found in an area of Red Springs known as something of a ""lovers' lane,"" according to Joe Freeman Britt, the district attorney who prosecuted them in the '80s. The ground was littered with ""beer cans, condoms and cigarettes,"" Britt said. It was one of those cigarette butts that ultimately set them free. DNA found on a cigarette ""matched another individual named Roscoe Artis, a convicted rapist and murderer who lived less than 100 yards from where the victim's body was found,"" said a statement from McCollum's and Brown's attorneys. Artis is serving a life sentence in a North Carolina prison on a separate conviction. It was not immediately clear Tuesday whether prosecutors would bring charges against him for Buie's murder. CNN Original Series: 'Death Row Stories' ""This is the most blessed day,"" Brown kept repeating Tuesday, according to his attorney, Ann Kirby, . ""It was an amazing moment for everyone,"" added Vernetta Alston, an attorney for McCollum. Only not everyone thought it was so amazing. ""This a tragic day for justice in Robeson County,"" said Britt. When asked whether Britt still believes he got the conviction right, without hesitation, he said, ""absolutely."" ""These guys got three trials. Thirty-six people reviewed it and thought the confessions were correct,"" Britt told CNN. ""You know how hard it is to get a conviction in a capital case?"" McCollum, 50, was 19 at the time of his arrest. He was sentenced to death in 1984 and is North Carolina's longest-serving death row inmate. Brown, who is four years younger than his half-brother, was initially sentenced to death as well but later had it reduced to life in prison. Kirby and Alston said that their clients' confessions were coerced and that both were ""severely intellectually disabled."" ""It's terrifying that our justice system allowed two intellectually disabled children to go to prison for a crime they had nothing to do with, and then to suffer there for 30 years,"" said Ken Rose, a lawyer with the Center for Death Penalty Litigation.

"Madrid (CNN) -- Spain's King Juan Carlos made a rare public apology Wednesday for his recent hunting trip to Africa that has caused an outcry in Spain and abroad for its expense during the nation's economic crisis and for hunting elephants. ""I am very sorry. I made a mistake and it won't happen again,"" the king told Spanish state television TVE as he left a Madrid hospital, where he underwent hip surgery last weekend after falling on the hunting trip in Botswana. The trip was intended to be a private outing for the 74-year-old king, unknown to the media and most Spaniards, until he was rushed back to Madrid and underwent replacement surgery on his right hip. In his brief apology, the king did not mention the hunting trip, but state television and other Spanish media reported that he was clearly referring to that. Spaniards generally hold the king in high regard for his service to the nation and his defense of democracy after the death of the dictator Francisco Franco in 1975 -- especially the king's decisive stand to halt a right-wing military coup in 1981. But after news emerged of the expensive hunting trip, with widespread Spanish media reports that it included the hunting of elephants, even normally-staunch political allies of the monarch said publicly that they considered the timing of the trip a mistake. Some called on him to apologize. Earlier Wednesday, speculation was rife in Spanish media that he would do so upon leaving the hospital, where doctors said in a medical report that he is recovering well from the hip surgery. The king said he will resume his responsibilities. His son, Crown Prince Felipe, has stood in for him at some events this week while he was in the hospital. The criticism of the trip initially focused on the expensive safari in the midst of the nation's deep crisis, with 23% unemployment, 5 million Spaniards out of work, and the government applying austerity cuts and tax increases to make up for budget shortfalls. The king himself had previously expressed his concern over the impact of the crisis on Spaniards and called on the nation to come together to get through the tough times. The royal household has a budget of 8.26 million euros ($10.8 million) this year, 2% less than last year, and had recently announced cuts of about $222,000, including trimming salaries of the highest-paid staffers at the royal palace. Some critics also wondered how much public money was spent for security on the king's private trip. The criticism later included animal rights activists, as reports emerged that the king was hunting elephants. At least one photo, said to be from an earlier trip, showed the king, rifle in hand, standing in front of a dead elephant. It was widely published last weekend in Spanish media, which said it was taken from the website of an African safari outfitter, and that the photo was later removed from the company's site. The criticism of the king comes amid frequent mention of the royal household in the news lately, much of it in an uncustomary unflattering light. Earlier this month, the king's 13-year-old grandson shot himself in the foot with a shotgun during target practice with his father, who is divorced from the king's eldest daughter, Princess Elena.

And the king's son-in-law, Inaki Urdangarin, who is married to the youngest daughter, Princess Cristina, is a suspect in a financial fraud scandal in which public funds earmarked for his foundation allegedly were diverted for private use. Urdangarin denies the charges. But last December, the royal household said Urdangarin would not take part in official ceremonies, which is a key role for members of the royal family. Urdangarin and his family were not present at Easter for the royal family's traditional photo.

"(CNN) -- From Kiev to Caracas, protesters are taking their indignation to a walkie-talkie app, but some may be running into government roadblocks. Zello allows smartphone users to send short voice messages from person to person or to a limited group of people. Some Ukrainians and Venezuelans have been using the app to organize their protests. Broadcasting a message to the world on social networks like Twitter is not always ideal for many people in chaotic situations. Apps like Zello and WhatsApp facilitate private, peer-to-peer digital messaging. Facebook's $19 billion plan to purchase WhatsApp underscores the need that more than 450 million users have to send messages that aren't broadcast for everyone to see. Zello, which was founded in Russia and is now based in Texas, has been one of the most downloaded apps in Ukraine and Venezuela, but late last week, Venezuelans began complaining that the app stopped working inside the country -- just one of the many apps and social networks that Venezuelans say have been blocked over the past weeks since protests began. Alexey Gavrilov, Zello's chief technology officer, confirmed to CNN that the app was blocked for users of CANTV, Venezuela's state-owned Internet service. This leads Zello to believe the Venezuelan government is behind the digital blockade. CNN has asked the Venezuelan government for comment, but no official has returned calls about the matter. Gavrilov has begun changing the Zello app's coding so it can evade the Venezuelan roadblocks. ""We just released an update to the Android application which changes the IP addresses and makes it much harder to block them, and we also submitted updates for iOS and BlackBerry,"" he told CNN. ""So people with Android can already use Zello again in Venezuela."" Zello is waiting for Apple and BlackBerry to approve the updated version of the app for those smartphone platforms. Venezuelans also report that pictures and videos have been blocked on Twitter inside the country. ""We believe the Venezuelan government is blocking the images,"" a spokesman for Twitter told CNN. In an e-mailed statement, the Venezuelan government ""emphatically and categorically"" denied ""any involvement in the outage reported by users."" Venezuelans have begun installing VPN software and apps on their phones to avoid the digital blockade. Virtual private networking essentially reroutes Internet connections through another country, allowing users to see an unblocked connection from a country like the United States. Citizens in Iran and China use the same tools to get around their governments' digital blockades.","Ukrainians and Venezuelans have used Zello walkie-talkie app to organize their protests .

"(CNN) -- Like many immigrant parents of Central American children who cross the U.S.-Mexico border alone, Elva Marroquin Rosales is now in agony over what became of her two small youngsters who dared to enter the United States illegally by crossing Rio Grande River. For two or three weeks, the Los Angeles area mother heard nothing about her son Angel, 10, and daughter Dulce, 7. It's a silence many Central American families in the United States endure, wondering for weeks or even months if their child is alive or dead. Then, Marroquin finally heard word about two weeks ago: she received a phone call from an ""immigration"" official in Texas who desperately sought the mother's voice in order to calm her two sobbing children, who were apparently in a detention facility. At last, Marroquin knew they were at least alive. She soothed her children, but then the June 8 phone call went dead. ""My children were heartbroken, sad, tearful, crying beyond comparison, begging me to take them out of there,"" Marroquin, 25, said. ""Their begging was so distressing because I couldn't run to get them."" Since then, Marroquin has been unable to track down the detention facility in Texas that called her, and now the angst of her children's absence goes on, day after day. Her son told her a painful rash was stinging his body. ""I wanted to run and tell him, 'Son, I'm here and you have me here,' but I simply couldn't. I cried and asked God to look after them,"" said Marroquin, who lives in Rialto, California. Marroquin's ongoing saga is the other half of what families experience when children, some as young as age 5, cross the border alone, with siblings or with other children as they become part of a disturbing new tactic to enter the United States illegally. Marroquin has now been waiting a total of one month for an official notice about her children's status. ""To be together with them and hugging them and telling them, 'I love you,' it will be worth the wait and the sacrifice,"" Marroquin said. Risking all . It's a high-risk mission that imperils a family's most precious asset -- and an experience shared by other parents and relatives of tens of thousands of Central American children. Many children become victims of crime or sex abuse during their unchaperoned journey. If the child successfully enters the country illegally, the reward for families and parents such as Marroquin is an emotional reunion of a high order. In Marroquin's case, she and her husband have been living in the United States for six years and now have an 8-month-old baby, their third child, whom the two older siblings haven't met face-to-face. The mother hasn't seen her two eldest children in person during those six years. She kept in touch with them online, through video chats on Skype. Marroquin hopes U.S. officials will call her again soon so her family can be reunited. But such U.S. reunions are being discouraged by federal officials, who are now streamlining bureaucracy so that the government can hasten the deportations of the children, to separate them again from their U.S.-based families. At the same time, the U.S. government is providing several million dollars in additional support for the three main Central American countries -- El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras -- to receive and repatriate migrant children and other deportees, the White House said Friday. Besides the peril of crossing the desert or waterways along the border, the children are finding their eventual arrest and detention as equally distressful: U.S. processing and detention facilities are designed more for adults than minors and offer poor living conditions for children. ""It is also hazardous to send a child into South Texas to a processing center,"" Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson stated last week. ""A processing center -- and a number of us here have seen them ourselves -- are no place for children, and to put a child into hands of a criminal smuggling organization is not safe either. ""I would encourage no parent to send their child or send for their child through this process,"" Johnson said. But Central American families take the risk any way, with private hopes that somehow they can obtain legal residency some day -- though the Obama administration warns that the unaccompanied children or mothers with children won't benefit from any proposed immigration reforms or a deferred deportation policy for young immigrants called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Central American treatment . What makes Central American children an exceptional case is how U.S. also favors them over other children arrested at the border: Mexican children are deported immediately, but the other Latin American children are detained and then put in the care of parents or relatives in the United States. They are then assigned a court date, but union leaders of the U.S. Border Patrol agents say many families skip the court dates, and the children join America's population of 11 million undocumented immigrants. Often fleeing drug and gang violence in their home countries, the children take buses from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, and when they reach the U.S.-Mexico border, they cross alone, with siblings or in groups of children, according to families. In Marroquin's case, her children were chaperoned by a relative on the bus rides from Chimaltenango, Guatemala, but when they reached the U.S. border, the two children joined a group of other minors, some with mothers, and crossed the Rio Grande River, Marroquin said. Marroquin offered some insight into why families allow children to take such unaccompanied risks: A smuggler charges $8,000 to guide two children to the border, but then asks for $7,000 more to escort them across, for a total of $15,000. Marroquin said she didn't use a smuggler, or so-called coyote, and instead relied on a family member to bring the children to the riverbank. To reduce the inflow, the U.S. government is providing millions of dollars in aid to the three Central American countries to combat violence at home: $40 million for Guatemala, $25 million for El Salvador, and $18.5 million for Honduras, the White House said. In the meantime, U.S. agencies are taking a disaster-like approach to what the White House calls the ""urgent situation"" of unaccompanied minors crossing into the United States. On Friday, Vice President Joe Biden met with Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina to discuss the massive migration of children from there. Biden also spoke by phone with Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez on his way to Guatemala to discuss a regional strategy to reduce the migration. At the same time, Homeland Security Secretary Johnson was scheduled to travel Friday to Texas to review the U.S. response to the crisis. A Salvadoran mother's wait . On average, apprehended child migrants under age 18 spend 35 days in U.S. custody and holding facilities, said Kenneth J. Wolfe, a deputy director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which provides the care and placement for such children. But some parents, such as one El Salvador immigrant mother in Los Angeles, had to wait so long that they began to wonder if they would ever see their child again. The mother asked to be identified only by her first name, Ana, because she fears for the safety of her two children. Her 12-year-old son, Henry, and 9-year-old daughter, Estefania, left El Salvador with their grandmother in December, and the three arrived in Mexico on December 24, Ana said. In early January, the grandmother hired a smuggler in Mexico to take the two children to the Rio Grande River and point them to Texas, Ana said. The grandmother last saw her two grandchildren in the company of other children, some with mothers, near the river, Ana said. It's unclear how far the smuggler may or may not have accompanied the children across the Rio Grande, Ana said. Two weeks later, Ana received a phone call from a U.S. immigration official. The good news was the official had Ana's children in custody. The bad news was her son was crying, and the federal worker asked the mother to speak to her son. ""All I told my son is to calm down, that everything will be okay,"" Ana said. Then, ""the call got cut off, and they didn't call me back,"" she said. Said son Henry in a recent interview: ""When I talked to my mom, I told her where I was, and she said not to worry and the phone got cut off."" A month later, HHS social workers called Ana: at last, they arranged for Ana to pick up her kids at Los Angeles International Airport. The rendezvous occurred in February. ""This was the longest wait for my life. I didn't know nothing -- how they were, if they ate or not,"" the mother said. ""When I saw them, I felt happy. They ran and hugged me and my daughter cried and I did, too, and that was it. ""Now that my kids are here. It's worth that risk,"" the mother said. Her two children seemed to agree -- though Estefania says she misses her grandmother, who raised them the past six years and is now back in El Salvador. ""Ever since I've been here my mom has taken us to different places, she has bought us toys, and she has taken us to really cool places,"" Estefania said. ""I'm happy to be here because it's different."" Crossroads of hope and fear: Stories from a desert bus station .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari's Fernando Alonso became the first two-time winner of the unpredictable 2012 Formula One season as he triumphed in front of his home fans in Valencia to claim the European Grand Prix Sunday. Alonso's win took him back to the top of the world championship standings with former leader Lewis Hamilton and defending two-time champion Sebastian Vettel failing to finish. It has been a weekend of double sporting celebration for austerity-hit Spain after Xabi Alonso's two goals gave the defending champions a 2-0 quarterfinal win over France in Euro 2012 on Saturday. ""I cannot put into words the special feeling of winning your home grand prix,"" Alonso told the post race press conference. ""It is unique and special. The stands were full of color and Spanish flags and, after the footballers won at Euro 2012, I am feeling very proud to be Spanish at the moment. This is possibly the best victory I have ever had."" But coming from 11th on the grid, Alonso needed a touch of good fortune to complete his remarkable victory ahead of Kimi Raikkonen in a Lotus. Red Bull's Vettel looked to be cruising from pole position to a third straight win on the street circuit in southern Spain, but his car suffered an engine failure on lap 35 of 57. With Vettel's retirement, Romain Grosjean of France in his Lotus looked primed for his maiden victory, but he too suffered a sudden engine failure, both alternator problems according to pit lane sources. There was bitter disappointment as well for McLaren's Hamilton, who was in third on the penultimate lap when he crashed out in controversial fashion as he tried to hold off Pastor Maldonado in the Williams. Hamilton, who had scored in all previous rounds of the championship, flung his steering wheel away in frustration before marching back to the pits. Venezuela's Maldonado slipped back to 10th after the collision, leaving Michael Schumacher to come through for his first podium finish since returning to F1 in 2010 with Mercedes. ""I asked my guys at the end of the race where I finished and when they told me third, I couldn't believe it. You lose count of where you are, it was busy at the end of the race,"" he said. Maldonado was later penalized 20 seconds by race stewards, dropping him back to 12th, with temmate Bruno Senna taking 10th for Williams. Force India pair Nico Hulkenberg and Paul di Resta took a fine fifth and seventh, sandwiching Nico Rosberg in the second Mercedes. Jenson Button was eighth for McLaren, Sergio Perez in ninth for Sauber. Alonso leads the title race on 111 points from Red Bull's Mark Webber in second on 91 after his fourth place finish in Spain. Hamilton has 88 with Vettel four points behind in fourth place.","Fernando Alonso wins European Grand Prix in Valencia .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal easily progressed to the third round of the Madrid Open after beating Russia's Nikolay Davydenko in straight sets 6-2 6-2 on Wednesday. It was the King of Clay's first work out on Madrid's controversial new blue clay surface but the world number two had little problem in dispensing with Davydenko in just over 80 minutes. ""I think that I played a really good match,"" he told the ATP Tour's official website after setting up a clash with fellow Spaniard Fernando Verdasco. ""It was my first match here in these circumstances. I am very happy about my result, about the way that I played."" His affable demeanor contrasted sharply with world number one Novak Djokovic, who had made tough work of beating Spanish qualifier Daniel Gimeno-Traver 6-2 3-6 6-2 on Tuesday. Djokovic had plenty to say about the blue clay after a minor scare on his first competitive outing on the new surface. The world No. 1 thought the players should have been consulted on Madrid's decision to depart from the traditional red clay and the Serbian cut a frustrated figure on court. ""It's impossible to move,"" he was quoted as telling reporters by AFP. ""I hit maybe five balls, the rest went just trying to put the ball into the court. ""I was relying on serve and getting free points from his unforced errors. That was not tennis, either I need football shoes or some advice on how to play on this court. ""I cannot find the words to describe this court. It's really tough to play like this on a center court. We need serious discussion about the future of this blue clay. ""We cannot change anything this year, but my first impressions are not good. I don't want to be the one complaining, but I say honestly what I feel."" World No. 3 Roger Federer survived a big scare against rising star Milos Raonic in Wednesday's late match, finally triumphing 4-6 7-5 7-6 (7-4) after more than two hours on court. ""I had a tough first set and one bad game that cost me the set really,"" said Federer, who won the event on hard court in 2006 and then in its first year on clay in 2009. ""He could swing big on my service games and I couldn't do that much on his, but I was getting more balls back as the match went on. I played a good tie-breaker overall."" Federer, playing his first match in five weeks following a third-round exit in Miami, will next play French 14th seed Richard Gasquet. ""It was pretty much a big struggle for me tonight but the level is pretty good and I'm happy where I am in the season,"" the 16-time grand slam champion said. It was a big disappointment for world No. 23 Raonic, who dominated for large spells of the match with his booming serve and powerful groundstrokes. ""I felt like I was on top throughout the whole match,"" Raonic said. ""I will probably be more happy with the whole outcome in a few days but now is not the right time."" In the women's draw in Madrid, French Open champion Li Na booked her quarterfinal place by beating Angelique Kerber of Germany 7-5 6-4. Li broke the the German number two on three occasions as she continued her fine form on clay after reaching the quarterfinals of the Stuttgart Open last month. China's leading player will next face world No.1 Victoria Azarenka, who beat former top-ranked Ana Ivanovic of Serbia 6-4 6-4. U.S. Open champion Samantha Stosur of Australian also reached the last eight with a 6-3 6-2 win over Czech Petra Cetkovska. Polish fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska ended the 16-match clay court winning streak of Italy's Sara Errani in spectacular fashion with a 6-0 6-1 rout in their second-round match.","Rafael Nadal sweeps aside Russia's Nikolay Davydenko 6-2 6-2 at the Madrid Open .

"(CNN) -- BP reported problems controlling the undersea well at the heart of the largest oil spill in U.S. history and won a delay in testing a critical piece of equipment in March, according to documents released Sunday. ""We are in the midst of a well control situation on MC 252 #001 and have stuck pipe. We are bringing out equipment to begin operations to sever the drillpipe, plugback the well and bypass,"" Scherie Douglas, a BP regulatory advisor, told the district engineer for the U.S. Interior Department's Minerals Management Service in a March 10 e-mail. In a follow-up e-mail to the district engineer, Frank Patton, Douglas reported the company wanted to get a plug set in the well before testing the blowout preventer, the massive device used to shut down the well in case of an emergency. ""With the give and take of the well and hole behavior we would feel much more comfortable getting at least one of the two plugs set in order to fully secure the well prior to testing BOPs,"" she wrote. When Patton told BP he could not delay a test any longer than it took to bring the well under control, the company won a postponement from David Trocquet, the MMS district manager in New Orleans, Louisiana, the documents show. Trocquet ordered BP to make sure its cement plug was set up and to verify its placement, according to his reply. The messages do not indicate how long the test was postponed. The exchange was among the documents released Sunday by leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is looking into the disaster that killed 11 workers aboard the drilling platform Deepwater Horizon and uncapped a gusher that is now fouling the northern Gulf of Mexico. BP has been unable to activate the well's blowout preventer since the explosion, resulting in up to 19,000 barrels (798,000 gallons) spewing into the Gulf every day. Appearing on ABC's ""This Week,"" BP Managing Director Bob Dudley said those questions are being addressed by an investigation led by the Coast Guard and the MMS, which oversees offshore oil drilling. BP, rig owner Transocean Ltd. and oilfield services company Halliburton have blamed each other for the disaster . ""There were issues of well control, signs out there, and there are strict procedures that are written,"" Dudley said. Those procedures allow the rig owner ""to walk through well control,"" he said. ""That's what the investigation will take minute by minute,"" he said. But he said the failure of the well's blowout preventer is a ""very troubling"" issue that will have repercussions throughout the oil industry. ""It is the piece of equipment that is not expected to fail, and that's going to have implications for everyone around the world,"" Dudley said. BP's design of the well has also come under scrutiny in the New Orleans hearings held by MMS and the Coast Guard. BP drilling engineer Mark Hafle testified Friday that he made ""several changes to the casing designs"" to address problems with the well's cement walls and leaking drilling fluid. But he said the problems had been addressed. ""No one believed there was going to be a safety issue with pumping that cement job,"" he said. Halliburton performed the cementing work on the well, and Halliburton worker Christopher Haire told the New Orleans hearings Friday that BP kept changing the dimensions of the well's casing. Meanwhile, BP's investigation ""raised concerns about the maintenance history, modification, inspection, and testing"" of the blowout preventer, committee chairman Henry Waxman, D-California, reported earlier this month. The New York Times reported Sunday that BP documents indicated the company had ""serious problems and safety concerns"" with the rig's well casing and blowout preventer for months. Rep. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who leads an Energy and Commerce subcommittee, said he has seen documents that confirm the Times report. Other witnesses at congressional hearings into the spill have raised concerns as well. Stephen Stone, a laborer on the doomed rig, told the House Judiciary Committee last week that the Transocean crew had to stop drilling four times in the space of 20 days because of the loss of drilling ""mud"" -- ""either because the underground formation was unstable, or because drilling too quickly caused the formation to crack,"" he said. And Doug Brown, the rig's chief mechanic, told the Judiciary Committee that cuts to Deepwater Horizon's engineering staff left the crew with a backlog of preventive maintenance to perform. When they complained, he said, ""We were always told, 'We will see what we can do.' ""","BP won delay in blowout preventer test .

"Rio de Janeiro (CNN) -- Soldiers in full combat gear move silently through a sprawling shantytown in northern Rio de Janeiro, pointing weapons down narrow alleys and poking through sacks of cement in search of drugs. Residents walk by, barely looking at the troops sent in to occupy the Complexo da Mare as an emergency response to escalating violence in the city's notorious favelas. Some 2,500 army troops and marines have moved in to reinforce police in an operation aimed at securing the slum, home to 130,000 people, ahead of the World Cup, which runs from June 12 to July 13.. Seizing control from drug gangs was deemed a priority because the shantytown lies just a few kilometers from Rio's international airport. ""It's not a peaceful operation because we have three different criminal gangs here and they are rivals,"" Gen. Roberto Escoto told CNN. The Rio state government requested the army occupation after a series of attacks against police posts. The troops will remain until at least July 31, after the World Cup ends, Escoto said. ""It's an emergency,"" Escoto said. ""The state police so far don't have enough policeman and enough equipment to operate in all the city."" It's also the latest campaign in Rio's so-called ""pacification"" program launched in 2008. Officials say that after neglecting security in the city's poorest neighborhoods for decades, police have now seized control from drug gangs in dozens of slums. While soldiers have provided support during the initial campaign, they have been replaced by police posts in most operations. But for the Complexo da Mare, officials decided more drastic measures were needed. Unlike many of the favelas that cling to the hills near Rio's picturesque beaches, the Complexo da Mare is a sprawling, mostly flat shantytown that combines 15 different neighborhoods in the city's smoggy north zone. Cement-block houses are covered with colorful graffiti and loops of tangled wire hang overhead, evidence of the do-it-yourself electricity that powers most homes. Schoolchildren play soccer on a synthetic-turf court while residents sit at plastic tables set up in the street, drinking beer and listening to music blast over speakers, seemingly oblivious to the heavily armed soldiers who march by. When asked, they refuse to talk about the military occupation. Troops have set up checkpoints at the entrances to the favela and patrol the streets on foot and in armored personnel carriers. Soldiers with metal detectors and trained dogs search for hidden caches of arms or drugs. So far, they have registered more than a half dozen gun battles. The resurgence in violence in some of the favelas already pacified has raised alarms in a city that will host many of the 600,000 international fans attending the World Cup. Rio also will host the Olympic Games in 2016. Tourists strolling along Copacabana Beach at the other end of the city said they were taking precautions, but not overly worried. Peter, a Belgian businessman in town for a conference, said he was given a brochure with a list of security suggestions when he arrived. ""I feel safe here, but I know where not to go,"" he said. Simon, a Danish exchange student, agreed that a little knowledge goes a long way. ""Use common sense, grab a cab in the evening,"" he said. ""Don't use public transportation at night."" In the Complexo da Mare, Escoto said the military will have everything under control. ""I can assure you that Brazil has conducted a very well-planned operation to secure the 12 cities,"" he said. ""Rio de Janeiro will be prepared for the World Cup,"" he added, before his aides whisked him off, part of their policy never to let their top commander stay in one place for long in hostile territory.","Brazil army tackles drug gangs in sprawling slum .

"(CNN) -- June Squibb has been in show business for 60 years -- but it's only now, with her performance in the film ""Nebraska,"" that she is getting wide recognition. And no wonder. It's not often a role gives an older woman an opportunity to say the F-word and lift up her skirts at a cemetery -- and leads to an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress. 5 things we learned from the Oscar nominations . As Kate Grant in ""Nebraska,"" Squibb is the blunt, put-upon wife of Woody Grant (Bruce Dern), a cantankerous former auto mechanic who's convinced he's won a million-dollar sweepstakes. It's a role that could have been played for one-dimensional laughs, but Squibb's performance brings out both Kate's hard edges and protective heart -- for her sons, who run interference for Woody, and for Woody himself. Director Alexander Payne wasn't surprised. ""It's called being a pro,"" he told The New York Times. Squibb had also appeared in Payne's ""About Schmidt"" as Jack Nicholson's wife, who dies early in the film. Squibb said she's thrilled with the attention but has had plenty of time to prepare. ""I've gone through being discovered an awful lot of times in New York on stage, and even some of the films I've made,"" she told CNN. She's been at this acting thing for a while, with regular appearances in the theater, in small movie roles and on television. Her late husband, Charles Kakatsakis, was an acting teacher. Their son, Harry, is a filmmaker. She knows the business. She even played on the silliness of Oscar campaigning in a video for ""Jimmy Kimmel Live."" ""Nebraska"" was released on DVD and Blu-ray on Tuesday. Squibb spoke with CNN about the film, her newfound fame and the Oscar nod. The following is an edited version of the interview: . CNN: So what's it like, being an overnight success at 84? June Squibb: It's different, God knows -- and I certainly was never nominated for an Academy Award before -- but it's fun. I'm enjoying it tremendously. CNN: Tell me how this came about. You had a small role in ""About Schmidt."" Squibb: (For) ""About Schmidt"" they didn't know me, and they were looking far and wide, and finally they accepted a tape from New York. (Alexander Payne) said, the minute he saw the tape he knew that's what he wanted for ""About Schmidt."" So 10 years have gone by, and again he was looking for this woman's role, and he told me he thought I wasn't right for it. He thought I was that sweet little lady from ""About Schmidt."" But his office asked if I would take the script and read two scenes on tape for him, and I did. And he said when he saw the tape, he knew this was it. CNN: What is an Alexander Payne shoot like? Squibb: It's very relaxed because he's relaxed. He basically comes into it knowing what he wants, and if he doesn't, he might even tell you. In one instance, when I was telling off the family with the F-word, he said to me, I don't know what I want. So we tried it all different ways. He's very open. And he does understand how an actor works. He understands what we have to go through to get somewhere. CNN: How did you approach portraying the wife? She starts out as almost dismissive of what seems like a no-good husband, and then you realize how deep and firm their passion and relationship is. Squibb: I didn't think that out so much. I think the way I work is each scene and deal with it as what that scene is. I never really thought in terms of the trip, because I was taking it. CNN: Were there any scenes that were difficult for you to do, like lifting up your skirts in the cemetery? (In that scene, Squibb's character mocks a former boyfriend by pulling up her skirt to show his gravestone what he missed.) Squibb: The cemetery is the first scene that I shot. When I found that out, I screamed, ""Alexander! This is hard!"" And he said, ""No, we're doing it first, and it'll be fine."" And of course it was. We had a good time and it was fun to shoot. I think he got what he wanted from it. The first day on set is always a little nervous-making, no matter how much you've worked or who you worked with. CNN: Did you always want to be an actress? Squibb: It was never a question of wanting. I always thought of myself as I am an actress. I went from Illinois to the Cleveland Playhouse and worked there for five years. And I went to New York from there. ... I went there in '56, and I was on Broadway by '59. I think I did five Broadway shows while I was there. I did everything -- off-Broadway, stock, anything you can possibly do. CNN: Has the acting life been all it's cracked up to be? Squibb: It's been a wonderful life. Of course, it's difficult -- it's probably the hardest career you could ever pick. But I've had a wonderful career; I've really worked a lot. I went to New York and started working right away. So I was one of the lucky ones in that respect.","June Squibb, 84, is up for best supporting actress for ""Nebraska""

"(CNN) -- In the early 1980s when I served on the staff of the Joint Economic Committee, we invited the Republican deficit scourge, Peter G. Peterson, to testify on Reaganomics, but he wouldn't come. Somewhat understandably, he declined to sabotage his own team. This week, when I was asked to comment on President Barack Obama's proposed ""Buffett Rule,"" I had a similar urge to duck. But it passed. The Buffett Rule would increase taxes on a handful of Mitt-Romney-like figures in today's America, raising a few billions of dollars in new revenues each year from the very rich. It is perfectly tailored to the Obama political style, which is to nod symbolically leftward while reserving big concessions for banks, venture capitalists and insurance companies. Symbolic gestures have their place. In this case, the proposed rule states an important principle of tax fairness. It calls attention to the larger issue of income inequality. It could be the start of a larger push for tax reform. No political progressive should sneer at an idea that helps bring these issues into focus. And especially not, if the direct effect might be to cost Romney, personally, millions of dollars. The image of him writing the check will, no doubt, give universal pleasure. Another virtue of the Buffett Rule is that it exposes the craven hypocrisy of its opponents. This is, after all, a very small tax increase. It is exquisitely targeted on a few individuals with large investment incomes. As drafted by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, it would provide a useful spur to their charity. There is no serious argument that the rule would make the tax code more inefficient than it already is. The grounds for opposing it can only be, well, craven and hypocritical. And yet, at the same time, by itself, the Buffett Rule solves no significant economic problem. It will not create any jobs, raise any wages, reduce the crushing debts of the middle class, slow the wave of foreclosures, conserve energy or reduce the price of gas. Nor will it restore confidence in the banks. And it is directed, at least in principle, toward a notorious nonproblem, namely the deficit and the public debt, on which we waste far too much ink as things stand. I noticed in the news that a number of states are once again taking the lead on measures to raise the minimum wage -- with Massachusetts moving toward a minimum of $10 per hour, and with other measures on the table in New York, Illinois, New Jersey, Connecticut and Missouri. Meanwhile Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, is pressing for the federal minimum to rise to $9.80 per hour by 2014. According to the Economic Policy Institute, Harkin's proposal would raise the incomes of 28 million American workers. It would make a big difference in the South, where wages are lower. It would especially help younger workers, minorities and women. It would not add to the deficit -- since federal workers all make more than that anyway -- and would likely spur the economy and increase tax revenues -- by a lot more than the Buffett Rule. I've proposed pushing the minimum wage up to $12 an hour, and at least some conservatives -- the editors at The American Conservative -- agree with this goal. (Actually I took my cue from them.) More recently, Reihan Salam at the National Review has weighed in, calling the idea ""a tougher call than I would've thought."" Salam suggested that Romney could transform his campaign by endorsing it. That's still possible, I suppose. But anyway we have a discussion and maybe even a left-right coalition -- that rarest of political birds -- getting under way. And on something real. The Buffett Rule would zing a few thousand high fliers, which is not bad. But maybe Obama should go beyond symbols and grab this idea while it's hot. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James K. Galbraith.","Democrats are making a case for the ""Buffett Rule"" to raise taxes on the very rich .
James Galbraith: While the legislation calls for tax fairness, it is a symbolic move .
Galbraith says the Buffett Rule won't solve any significant economic problem .
It's better if President Obama would focus on raising the minimum wage, he says ."
"(CNN) -- With the advent of smartphones we've become used to being constantly connected, even when we're on the road or on vacation. But now a growing number of hotels are adding ""digital detox"" packages to their roster of offerings. Detox packages are nothing new. For decades, hotels and vacation retreats have enticed guests to ""clean out,"" often with the help of a specialized diet plan and fitness regimens (with a massage thrown in for good measure). These days, the concept is being pushed to help us disconnect from technology. The World Travel Market Global Trends Report even listed digital detox as one of the next big trends to hit the hospitality industry in the coming year. The push has come on the heels of increasing reports of travelers' inability to ""unplug."" A recent Google survey found that in the United States, 80% of smartphone users almost never leave their home without their device, while a TripAdvisor survey found nearly half of mobile owners use their phone to augment their vacation (e.g. taking travel photos, researching restaurants, and so on). Read more: Airlines cash in as in-flight wi-fi takes off . ""We've witnessed the increased dependency people now have on their electronic devices,"" notes Andrew Henning, the general manager at The Westin Dublin, in Ireland. In March, the hotel introduced a digital detox package to combat this gadget addiction (recently classified in the media as ""nomophobia""). Guests that partake in the package stash their electronic devices in a safe, and in exchange get a detox survival kit, which includes a board game, a walking map, a tree-planting kit, and other reminders that life exists beyond the confines of an iPad. Via Yoga, a company that hosts yoga retreats in Mexico and Costa Rica, feels so strongly about the need for its guests to unplug that it decided to offer a 15% discount as an incentive for anyone willing to give up their iPhone. ""In the last couple of years, people have started carrying their phones and tablets with them all the time,"" notes Suzie Cavassa, the company founder. ""Our customers were even using them at dinner, or when hanging out by the pool,"" she says. ""They were so preoccupied that they were missing out on the experiences they were paying for."" For guests that take the detox option (about 15 per season), Cavassa will lock away their devices and give them an emergency number, so that if someone does really need to reach them, they're not completely out of touch. ""If someone needs to get hold of you, they can. But you're not working or checking Facebook; you're just experiencing the moment, checking out the sunset, or having a great conversation with someone you just met."" Cavassa admits that it takes a few days for most guests to stop feeling antsy as a result of the separation from their devices. Physical activities, like surfing and yoga, help make the transition easier, she notes. ""Surfing is the type of activity that forces you to be in the present,"" she says. ""There's no way you're thinking about Facebook or what you have to do at work when a giant wave comes at you."" Via Yoga's detox package is popular, but other venues offering similar packages admit that while there's interest, they're not flooded with bookings. The Hotel Monaco Chicago provides guests with a ""black-out"" option, whereby they surrender their gadgets to reception upon checking in. ""We were constantly hearing from guests how they loved that the Monaco was an escape from the hustle and bustle of the city,"" says Marco Scherer, the hotel's general manager. ""We decided to allow our guests the option to experience the ultimate seclusion by voluntarily forfeiting all methods of electronic communication at check-in."" Though guests are intrigued by the package, Scherer says very few actually opt to give up their devices. ""Most guests prefer our free wi-fi,"" he admits. Read more: Why are we still paying for hotel wi-fi? Henning says the same is true at the Westin. While guests from as far afield as Belgium, France, Poland and South Korea have called and expressed interest in the package, none have yet booked it. He says: ""We have found that guests are intrigued by the idea of detoxing from their electronic devices, but are not quite willing to make the commitment to a full digital detox.""","Many find it hard to disconnect, even when on holiday .

"(CNN) -- Negotiations between NFL owners and the players union on a new collective bargaining agreement were given a 24-hour extension Thursday, according to a statement from the league. ""The NFL and NFL Players Association have agreed to extend the expiration of the (collective bargaining agreement) for 24 hours and continue negotiating under the direction"" of  federal mediator George Cohen, the statement said. ""The agreement by both sides to refrain from comment on the negotiations remains in place."" Representatives of the players and owners have been meeting in Washington. ""I just want to say to all of our fans who dig our game, we appreciate your patience while we work through this,"" said NFL Players Association Executive Director DeMaurice Smith. ""We're going to keep working. We want to play football."" Without a last-minute agreement or the extension of the deadline, the NFL Players Association had been expected to decertify on Thursday afternoon -- meaning it would stop being the collective bargaining agent for the players. By decertifying, the union would clear the way for the players to file an antitrust lawsuit if the owners lock out the players as soon as Friday, after the current contract expires. All of that would mean the first NFL work stoppage since 1987 and the likelihood of months of labor and legal maneuvering for football fans already confused about how a $9 billion industry lacks enough money to satisfy everyone. Even if there is a lockout, the NFL draft would proceed as scheduled on April 28-30, the league says. All other regular off-season activity would cease, threatening to delay or cancel the start of the 2011 season now scheduled for September 8. Asked about the talks, President Obama said Thursday that the parties ought to be able to figure out how to split the revenue and keep fans happy. ""You've got owners, most of whom are worth close to a billion dollars, you've got players who are making millions of dollars,"" he said during a joint news conference with visiting Mexican President Felipe Calderon. ""My working assumption, at a time when people are having to cut back, compromise and worry about making the mortgage and paying for their kids' college education is that the two parties should be able to work it out without the president of the United States intervening."" Currently, the owners take about $1 billion off the top of league revenue, and the players get 60 percent of the rest. For a new contract, the owners want to double their take off the top to $2 billion, with the players continuing to get 60 percent of the rest. The NFL generated $9.3 billion in revenue in 2010. Other issues include a proposal by the owners to increase the regular season schedule to 18 games from the current 16. The overall number of games per season, including exhibition games, would remain at the current 20. The players' union questions why the owners should get additional money up front and challenges the league's 32 teams to fully open their financial records. The owners, who say they are not legally obligated to provide full financial disclosure, argue they are looking out for the long-term stability of the franchises and the league. If there is a lockout, players won't get their salaries or bonuses, and if the shutdown forces the league to cancel games next season, the NFL estimates a loss of $400 million in revenue each week. Another possible scenario from the talks would have Cohen declare an impasse that would automatically extend the rules of the expiring collective bargaining agreement. Such an impasse can only occur if neither side takes steps to halt the negotiations, such as the union decertifying or the owners declaring a lockout.","Negotiations extension averts lockout, for now .
NFL owners and players are negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement .
A federal mediator is overseeing the talks .

"(CNN) -- The allegations grabbed headlines across Mexico and around the globe: Hooded gunmen stormed into a beach bungalow and attacked a group of Spanish tourists, authorities said, raping six women and tying up a group of men with cell phone cables and bikini straps. The high-profile case in the Mexican resort city of Acapulco this week was a sharp reminder of significant security problems in a state that has seen violence surge even as homicide numbers in other hotspots across the country have started to dip. Mexico drug-related violence: How it all started . And it drew renewed attention to topics that Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has steered out of the spotlight since he took office in December. As authorities investigate the alleged crime, experts say the incident shows that even as Mexico's new government tries to paint a brighter picture and revamp the country's image, realities on the ground remain complicated -- and, in some areas, ugly. Follow the latest news in Spanish at CNNMexico.com . A state plagued by warring gangs . For years Guerrero state, where Acapulco sits, has ranked among the Mexican states with the highest homicide rates, a crime statistic regularly used by officials and analysts when discussing the overall security situation. Last year Guerrero had more reported gun murders than any other state in Mexico, more than 1,600, according to a federal government tally released last month. ""While places like Ciudad Juarez have become safer, other places in the country have seen violence spike up,"" said Christopher Wilson, an associate at the Washington-based Mexico Institute. ""Acapulco is one of the areas, and in fact, the entire state of Guerrero is one of the places, where there's been more violence recently."" Local authorities said Tuesday that the alleged rape wasn't tied to organized crime but then revealed Wednesday that they believe the victims bought drugs from one or more of the suspects in the days before the alleged attack. Even if a major criminal organization like Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman's notorious Sinaloa cartel wasn't behind the alleged attack, it's part of a deep-seated security problem in the region, said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst at the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness think tank. ""It wasn't El Chapo Guzman,"" he said, ""but I think it was one of the many gangs in Acapulco."" Fragmentation of large organizations like the once-powerful Beltran Leyva cartel has fueled the creation of dozens of smaller criminal gangs battling for turf in the Pacific port city and the surrounding state, Hope said. And even though many of the groups are more focused on crimes such as extorting business owners than on drug trafficking, he said, that hasn't stemmed the violence. Authorities haven't been able to get a handle on the problem, said Jorge Chabat, who studies security at Mexico's Center for Research and Teaching in Economics. ""Basically the government can't control them,"" he said. ""This is just one example of the climate of insecurity that Guerrero has been living."" Particular regions of Mexico -- often those near the border and along lucrative trafficking routes -- have borne the brunt of the country's drug-related violence. Nationwide, official figures indicate violence in Mexico may be declining. In 2012, there were 20,568 intentional homicides across the country, an 8.5% decrease from 2011. ""2012 was the first year when it fell, but we are still double where we were in 2007,"" Hope said. Experts caution that reliable statistics are hard to come by. Last year the government stopped releasing its tally of deaths tied to organized crime, which had become a measure many used to debate the success of then-President Felipe Calderon's drug war. Now only more general homicide statistics are released, without describing the circumstances. It's unclear whether Mexico has turned a corner, Wilson said, but the fact that cities like Ciudad Juarez and Tijuana have seen violence drop gives some hope for the future. ""If they can turn things around, then there's no reason why every other city in Mexico can't do the same thing,"" Wilson said. ""We now have success stories, which we couldn't say three years ago."" A new president changes the tone . Even if the numbers may be shifting in his favor, Mexico's new president hasn't been talking much about violence. Right before he took office, Pena Nieto began a trip to the United States in November saying that ties between the neighboring nations must go beyond the drug war. In Mexico now, the once-common government press conferences presenting high-profile cartel captures seem to be a thing of the past. ""There's a belief that they have that the criminal groups do sort of take advantage of the media and the attention in order to create fear, basically, and therefore space to act with impunity,"" Wilson said. ""So the government decided deliberately they won't parade recently arrested criminals in front of the cameras."" That's a marked change from his predecessor, Calderon, who announced a crackdown on cartels shortly after taking office in December 2006. The war on drugs became a hallmark of his presidency, and the death toll from drug-related violence during his tenure had soared to more than 47,500 when the government stopped releasing updated figures in early 2012 -- his last year in office. In farewell speeches, Calderon noted that 25 of Mexico's 37 most wanted criminals had been apprehended on his watch. ""The government of Pena Nieto is trying not to talk about the issue of violence,"" said Chabat. ""It's a strategy to change perceptions."" The reason is clear, said George W. Grayson, who studied Mexico's ruthless Zetas cartel for his 2012 book ""The Executioner's Men."" ""You don't want to talk about your crazy aunt in the attic. ... They want to shift the narrative,"" he said. On the campaign trail last year, Pena Nieto vowed to reduce violence and said he'd take a different tack -- an election promise that played well with voters in a country weary of a drug war with a growing body count. But two months into his six-year presidency, analysts say it's still unclear how he'll accomplish that goal. ""What he wants to crack down on are kidnappings, extortion, what's more likely to affect average people. There's been no secret that he wants to move in that direction and use more of a scalpel than a broad sword in combating the cartels,"" Grayson said, ""and he seems to have sent a subliminal message to the cartels saying that if you just conduct your business and don't disturb civilians, we're not going to ignore you, but you're not a top priority."" Pena Nieto has stressed that fixing social and economic problems will foster peace in Mexico, and he's made some security policy shifts. He started his term by eliminating the public safety ministry and placing the federal police it once controlled under the interior ministry's power. He's also discussed a plan to divide the country into regions to tackle security problems and to create a new national gendarmerie force, which could eventually send Mexico's military out of the streets and back into their barracks. But the time frame for those changes is uncertain. And in the meantime, discussing violence less doesn't make the longstanding systemic problems fueling it go away, Chabat said. ""It is important for any government to talk about other topics, like the economy. But you can't negate what is happening, what people are still experiencing,"" he said. 'We are left with no other choice' In some areas of Mexico, residents are tired of waiting for the government to step in to solve their problems. ""What we are seeing in a lot of parts of the country is a vacuum of the state ... and the proliferation of private security corps, of paramilitary groups,"" Chabat said. Incidents like the tourist attack in Guerrero will only do more to promote that approach, Chabat said, noting that it raises worrying concerns about abuses by vigilantes taking the law into their own hands. ""The government is overcome. ... That's the tragedy,"" he said. ""There is no short-term solution."" As word of this week's rape allegations in Acapulco spread, a group of people in one nearby neighborhood took a vote on Tuesday. If local, state and federal officials can't track down and apprehend those responsible, they decided they'll take matters into their own hands. ""We are going to have to rise up with weapons. ... We cannot wait until they keep destroying the port of Acapulco with these kinds of incidents,"" said Sergio Mejia, president of a 35-member association of restaurant and business owners in Acapulco's Bonfil beach community. ""We think the government is very timid, very slow. If there is no immediate response, it leaves us no choice but to join the fight and set up checkpoints on the street corners."" Months ago, he read about other groups in the region taking similar steps, forming paramilitary self-defense groups of masked men that patrol the streets. At first, it seemed extreme. Now, it sounds sensible, he said. In this area where the economy relies on tourism, he said, residents are tired of waiting for authorities to take action. But it's not just that a high-profile crime targeting tourists is bad for business. ""Today they were foreigners,"" said Mejia, who owns a restaurant that specializes in serving up freshly caught seafood. ""Tomorrow it could be our families."" Guerrero is named for a military general who fought for Mexico's independence from Spain. It's also the Spanish word for warrior. If the government can't protect them, Mejia says it's time for the state's residents to fight back. More: Town takes justice into their own hands .

"(CNN) -- David Villa was top goalscorer at Euro 2008 as Spain secured a first major championship in 44 years, but the world champions' all-time leading marksman will not be part of next month's title defense in Poland and Ukraine. Villa, who has scored 51 international goals, has been out of action since December, when he fractured a bone in his left leg while playing for Barcelona at the FIFA Club World Cup. The Spanish Football Federation's website has confirmed that the 30-year-old will not be fit enough to be part of coach Vicente del Bosque's 23-man squad, which will be named on Sunday. Who are European football's 'Most Valuable Players?' ""Villa spoke with the national team coach after the team arrived (for a training camp) in Schruns, Austria,"" it reported. ""After not getting in the final practice and development desired, David Villa spoke with Del Bosque, who relayed that although it was Villa's wish to be with the team in Poland and Ukraine, that his physical state was 'not as good' as would be desirable."" It is the second setback for Del Bosque, who will also be without injured key defender Carles Puyol for the June 8-July 1 tournament. Villa , who scored five goals as Spain won the 2010 World Cup, expressed his gratitude to fans for their continued backing. ""Thanks to all of you for your support,"" the former Valencia striker wrote on micro-blogging site Twitter. ""I will continue working to return to play as soon as possible with Barca and the Spanish national team."" Villa's absence was felt by Barca, who missed out on the Spanish league title for the first time in four years and finished second -- nine points behind archrivals Real Madrid. With Villa unavailable, the door is now open for Fernando Torres to stake a claim for a return to the starting lineup. The Chelsea striker, who scored the only goal as Spain beat Germany 1-0 in the Euro 2008 final, has been called into the squad for Saturday's friendly against Serbia. Fernando Llorente, the Athletic Bilbao forward who starred during the Basque club's run to the Europa League final, is also hoping to lead Spain's frontline. Four Four Two magazine's Tim Stannard explained how the absence of Villa, captain Carles Puyol and the loss of form of several key players could mean Joachim Low's Germany are now favorites for the tournament. ""Germany moved into the favorites position, although they do have a very tough group to get through,"" said Stannard. ""It's not just that Puyol is out. Gerard Pique is very much out of form, there are doubts about who is going to play at full back. Iniesta and Pedro aren't in very good form and neither is Fernando Torres."" Stannard tipped Llorente to fill Villa's boots, although he will first have to emerge unscathed from Bilbao's Copa del Rey final against Barcelona on Friday. ""The Copa del Rey final is another huge blitz to Del Bosque at the end of a badly organized campaign so far for Spain,"" he said. Drawn in Group C, Spain will first face 2006 World Cup winners Italy in Gdansk on June 10 before playing Croatia and the Republic of Ireland.","David Villa is ruled out of Spain's Euro 2012 campaign with a fractured leg .

"(CNN) -- Pemba Sherpa had already reached Camp 1 on Mount Everest when he heard the loud and chilling bang of the avalanche. He knew his father was behind him on the Khumbu Icefall and ran down the mountain, only to find the devastation of ice, snow and baggage scattered everywhere. ""I thought he abandoned his load and ran to safety,"" he tells me, almost whispering. ""But I could not find him amid the commotion at base camp. Then I saw the helicopters, with the bodies on the suspended ropes, and I knew I lost my dad."" Ang Tshiring's body was taken to Lukla, a tourist town where most who embark on a trip to Everest Base Camp start out. From there, Pemba and his brother carried him home themselves on foot, a trek that took seven hours along the mountain trail. Unforgiving land of few opportunities . Ang Tshiring, 57, was a high altitude cook. For the past 15 years, during the climbing season, he spent one month at Everest Base Camp and one month at Camp 2, at 6,100 meters. Two months to earn $1,500, meant to last the year. Ang Tshiring was famous for always showing happiness. Climbers who knew him remember him as a funny man, laughing and joking all the time, never angry, always kind. His son Pemba, 37, lives with the family in Thamo, a small village of 50 souls located in the Thame Valley in the Khumbu, where the country's greatest ethnic Sherpa climbers live, well off the beaten track of Nepal's Everest Base Camp trail. The Thame Valley suffered the biggest loss of life from April's Everest tragedy that killed 13 guides (another three are still missing and presumed dead), the deadliest accident in the history of the world's highest peak. Here, every man, if not in school or too old, is involved in climbing expeditions. They have few other choices. Little grows but the odd patch of potatoes. Few tourists pass by and yak herding is an insufficient way to make a living. Cut off from the economic tourism opportunities that the rest of Nepal's Kumbhu region enjoys, uncontaminated by progress, the Thame Valley retains the atmosphere of ancient Himalaya -- which for centuries nurtured the Western utopian dream that a secret land of happiness may exist somewhere among the impenetrable snow-capped mountains. The villages are marked by the vernacular architecture of slate-roofed houses. Traders still cross the perilous high passes into Tibet with their cargo of salt and wool as they've done since ancient times. There's an abundance of pagodas, monasteries, stone walls carved with mantras, wheels containing prayer scrolls and sacred shrines. Thousands of colorful flags flutter in clusters, offering prayers to be carried along by the wind. Everest avalanche: American climber recounts how Sherpa saved his life . A time to earn merit, not mourn . In Ang Tshiring's home, feelings of sadness are eclipsed by spiritual duty. ""All that matters now are the puja,"" says Ang Riku, his widow, referring to a series of prayers and rituals. Her focus is on directing special prayers aimed at purifying and earning merit for Ang Tshiring's spirit. Nothing else holds relevance for her -- not the political demands of the Sherpas, nor the discussions raging on social media worldwide, nor whether someone will climb Everest from the Nepal side of the mountain this year. She's silencing her mourning and sorrow to give all of herself for the benefit of Ang Tshiring. The Sherpa follow one of the Tibetan sects of Buddhism, Nyingmapa, and believe that 49 days after Ang Tshiring's death, his next life is determined and he may reborn. Ang Riku is concerned. She says accidental deaths are a bad way to go. It means Ang Tshiring's consciousness was in confusion when he died, and that affects his afterlife and rebirth. The more people involved in the prayers, the better the chances of a superior reincarnation. Ang Riku and Ang Tshiring's private quarters have been transformed into a prayer room, and we all sleep together on the floor of the main hall. Early in the morning, Ang Riku and I plan to go to the three isolated monasteries of Ginupa, Charok and Laudo, located high on the steep hills above Thamo. Immersed in nature, they're a retreat for ascetics and much revered by local communities. On the kitchen table are several kilograms of rice, three bottles of Coke, a few pats of butter and sugar. Her son, Pemba, has already left for Namche Bazar to meet the management of the company his father worked for to discuss what support they can offer. ""You are my porter,"" Ang Riku says, bursting into a laugh, and I'm glad that she finds my presence amusing. High cost of devotion . Ang Riku climbs the yak trails with determination, stopping every few minutes to catch her breath. We pass through forests of juniper, continuously climbing until we reach the clouds and the monasteries hidden in them. At each gompa (monastery), the same ritual takes place. The lama (priest) offers us butter or milk tea and food. We politely decline, but the lama insists and we accept. We barely empty half of our bowls when the lama comes to fill them again. We decline, he insists, we accept again. Then Ang Riku offers money for the lama to perform the puja. The lama declines, she insists, he accepts. This display of generosity is a fundamental aspect that governs the relationship of the Sherpas. Next, Ang Riku prepares a copper plate full of rice, the equivalent of $30, and a ceremonial white scarf that the lama will use for the prayers. We pay our respects in the monastery's prayer room. Before leaving, the lama puts the ceremonial scarf around Ang Riku's neck. It's an emotional moment, the only time Ang Riku lets her emotions overtake her. She cries, holding the hands of the lama, abandoning herself in his support. After six or seven bowls of noodles and a dozen teas, we head back home. Ang Riku's face is relaxed. She's carried out important deeds for her husband. But today was just a small part of the funeral rites. Ang Riku also sends bags with salt, butter, rice and money to 500 families in the valley, so they'll recite prayers for Ang Tshiring. She says she sent similar bags to many monasteries in the Kumbhu and in special holy places as far as India. The cost of such devotion is high. To confirm a day of puja in a large monastery costs $1,300. The total expenditure will be upward of $10,000, significantly more than the life insurance that the government pledged after many protests by the Sherpas. Ang Riku says she had to ask for a loan at the market at an interest rate of 25% per year -- she doesn't have the collateral to borrow from banks. Climbers head home as Everest Sherpas refuse to work . ""I wonder if I will come back alive?"" Although the world regards them as high altitude guides and porters, most Sherpas don't want to be mountain climbers on Everest. Better jobs are available for many in the other valleys of the Khumbu that cater to trekking tourists. But here in the Thame Valley, there aren't many options. ""Every time I go on a climbing expedition, I wonder if I will come back alive,"" says Pemba. ""I feel sad, but I have to do this job for my family. I've summited Everest 14 times and I've always brought a photograph of my family with me."" Though more catastrophic than usual, this year's tragedy was no great surprise for those in the Thame Valley, who have become familiar the loss of life that almost always occurs in April and May. The only difference, Pemba tells me, is that ""this year was particularly unlucky."" The Sherpas' approach to religion includes an animist tradition that holds that mountains and other natural features are the abodes of deities that can make men suffer if they fail to respect them. I offer a puja in the monastery for Ang Tshiring in the afternoon and ask Lopsang, a young monk who says he escaped from Tibet, the reason behind the bad luck. ""I don't know if the god of the moun .","Ang Tshiring, 57, was among the 16 killed in this year's Mount Everest avalanche .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- It's a moment for the ages. Tens of thousands of South Africans, dozens of presidents and prime ministers, celebrities and street sweepers are all heading to the same place: a stadium in Johannesburg, where they'll honor Nelson Mandela at a memorial service on Tuesday. With 91 heads of state attending, security will be tight. Authorities are already stepping up surveillance as presidents of six nations prepare to pay tribute to the late anti-apartheid leader in a four-hour service that will likely bring much of South Africa to a stop. Working off plans developed for years in secret, the South African government is using an elite military task force, sniper teams and canine teams to help secure the stadium, CNN's Arwa Damon reported Monday. In addition, helicopters and military jets frequently fly overhead. ""Should anybody, anything dare to disturb or disrupt this period of mourning and finally taking and accompanying the former president to his last resting place, then that person will be dealt with,"" Brig. Gen. Xolani Mabanga said Monday. South African officials won't give details about their security plans -- how many police officers, how many troops, precautions to keep the stadium weapons- and explosives-free. ""But we can assure that all necessary steps have been taken, and that is why the leadership of the world and former leaders of the world have confidence to come to our country at this time to share with us this moment,"" said Minister in the Presidency Collins Chabane. The event promises to rival other significant state funerals in recent decades, such as that of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1965 and the 2005 funeral of Pope John Paul II, which attracted some 2 million people to Rome -- among them four kings, five queens, at least 70 presidents and prime ministers and the leaders of 14 other faiths. At that event, metal detectors and some 15,000 members of security forces stood watch over the event. U.S. official: South Africa experienced at hosting crowds . U.S. officials are satisfied with security arrangements. ""We have not heard any concerns,"" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters aboard Air Force One as President Barack Obama flew to South Africa. ""The South Africans hosted the World Cup, so they have experience hosting significant crowds and managing events like this, although clearly this is really a unique event in world history, given the number of leaders coming to pay their respects, as well as the people of South Africa."" Given Mandela's ailing health, the U.S. Secret Service made some arrangements in advance, a Secret Service spokesman said. But work that would usually take months to complete has been done in less than a week, the spokesman said. ""It's a compressed timeline, but there are certain protocols we must have in place for any trip,"" the spokesman said. Those protocols involve securing the president's motorcade route and hotel rooms and doing security walk-throughs. The spokesman declined to offer specific details on security measures at the stadium. While Tuesday's memorial is the first major event honoring Mandela since his death, it won't be the last. A state funeral will be held Sunday in Mandela's ancestral hometown of Qunu in South Africa's Eastern Cape province. Send us your stories, memories and photographs of the Nobel Peace prize winner and former South African president. Presidents set to speak at service . Among the speakers at Tuesday's memorial will be President Obama, who like Mandela was his nation's first black president. Obama has cited Mandela as his own inspiration for entering politics. In addition to Obama, former Presidents Jimmy Carter, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton will attend. More than two dozen U.S. lawmakers also plan to go. Other guests include the Prince of Wales, British Prime Minister David Cameron and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who will also speak, as well as celebrities such as Bono, Oprah Winfrey and Naomi Campbell. Crews worked overtime Monday to prepare FNB Stadium in Johannesburg for the service. The stadium, where Mandela delivered his first major speech after his release from prison, can hold some 90,000 people, but that won't be enough to hold the hundreds of thousands clamoring to celebrate Mandela's life. The government has set up overflow locations at stadiums and other facilities throughout the country. With private vehicles banned from the area around the stadium, the government pressed buses from around the country into service and stepped up train service to move the crowds. In addition to Obama and Ban, the presidents of Brazil, Namibia, India, Cuba and South Africa are expected to speak at the service, as are family members, friends and others. One potential complication: Forecasters predicted potentially heavy rainfall during the event at the open-air stadium. Monday events . South Africa's Parliament reconvened Monday for an afternoon of speeches and memorials to Mandela. Dozens of members of parliament spoke. ""The world over, his name has evolved into a metaphor,"" Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe said. ""The name Nelson Mandela has entered the pantheon of history's sages."" Out of the public eye, friends who had not seen each other in years have been coming together with Mandela's family in his home, said Zelda la Grange, Mandela's longtime personal assistant. Mandela called la Grange his ""rock,"" even though she seemed an unlikely confidante. She was a white Afrikaner and an employee of the former apartheid government. In her first interview since Mandela's death, she described the mood in his home to CNN's Robyn Curnow on Monday. ""Obviously there's sadness in the house,"" she said, but also, ""People are celebrating Madiba's life. They are grateful."" She referred to Mandela by his well-known clan name. CNN's Athena Jones, Holly Yan, Chris Cuomo, Kim Norgaard, Robin Curnow, Arwa Damon and David McKenzie contributed to this report.","Elite troops, snipers, canines helping secure stadium .

"Washington (CNN) -- Some terrorism suspects held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, will be moved to an Illinois prison that the federal government will buy to hold them, the Obama administration announced Tuesday. Fewer than 100 Guantanamo detainees would come to the maximum-security Thomas Correctional Center, 150 miles west of Chicago, said Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois. Republican Rep. Mark Kirk of Illinois put the figure at 70. An executive order issued by President Obama called for Attorney General Eric Holder to purchase the nearly vacant prison and for Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to ""prepare the [prison] for secure housing of detainees currently held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base who have been or will be designated for relocation, and shall relocate such detainees to the [prison], consistent with laws related to Guantanamo detainees."" The federal government will enhance one section of the prison to make it exceed perimeter security standards at the nation's only ""supermax"" prison in Colorado, according to a letter to Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn signed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Gates, Holder, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and National Intelligence Director Dennis Blair. About 215 detainees are held at the controversial U.S. detention facility in Cuba, and finding a place to move some of the detainees was crucial to government plans to close it. By closing Guantanamo, ""we are removing from terrorist organizations around the world the recruiting tool"" the detention center symbolizes, said retired Marine Gen. James Jones, the national security adviser. At a White House briefing, senior administration officials authorized to speak on background said the Thomson prison would receive Guantanamo detainees facing trial in U.S. courts or by military commission. Detainees being sent to other countries would travel directly from Guantanamo without coming to the United States, they said. Obama ""has no intention of releasing any detainees in the United States,"" said the letter to Quinn. ""Current law effectively bars the release of the Guantanamo detainees on U.S. soil, and the federal government has broad authority under current law to detain individuals during removal proceedings and pending the execution of final removal orders."" Read White House letter to Quinn (PDF) However, senior administration officials in said current law would have to change for any Guantanamo suspects facing indefinite detention to be transferred to U.S. soil. Quinn welcomed the plan, saying it would bring badly needed jobs to the region and help serve the national security interest. He said Illinois would charge a fair market price for the prison, which cost $145 million to build in 2001. ""The local community is united in wanting to have this federal prison located in Thomson, Illinois,"" Quinn said. Republicans criticized the plan for bringing terrorism suspects into the country despite questions over the legality of terms of their continued detention. ""Without a vote, a public hearing or a detailed plan, the governor and the administration are moving quickly to force the citizens of Illinois to accept this risk,"" Kirk said. In a statement by Military Families United, the former commander of the USS Cole, which was attacked by al Qaeda in Yemen in 2000, called closing Guantanamo a mistake. ""Congress and the American people must now stand up and prevent our communities, our justice system and our hard-earned money from being used by the Administration to prop up, perhaps, the most dangerous campaign promise ever uttered,"" the statement quoted Kirk Lippold as saying. An anti-Guantanamo group welcomed the development. ""We applaud the Obama administration for taking an important step forward toward closing the debacle in Guantanamo Bay,"" said former Rep. Tom Andrews, director of the National Campaign to Close Guantanamo. ""President Obama is standing with Gen. Colin Powell, who has long called for the closure of Gitmo, and standing up to the politics of fear and manipulation,"" he said in a statement. ""It's time for Congress to stop playing politics and join the president in removing this stain from America's standing in the world, save American taxpayers millions of dollars and deny al Qaeda one of its most potent recruiting tools."" The Obama administration hoped to close the prison by January but has admitted that it will not meet that goal. Illinois state officials have said the plan would call for housing federal prisoners, including some Guantanamo detainees, in the largely vacant maximum-security facility in northern Illinois. The letter to Quinn said federal prisoners from overcrowded facilities elsewhere would be transferred to the Thomson prison, which also will house Guantanamo detainees in the specially secured section. The governor and other officials have said that such a deal could provide 2,000 local jobs and up to $1 billion in federal money to the area. Durbin, the Senate's second-ranking Democrat, said in November that federal officials indicated that fewer than 100 detainees from Guantanamo would be housed in the 1,600-bed facility. They would be in a wing under the control of the Department of Defense, while the Bureau of Prisons would assume responsibility for the rest of the facility. The Thomson prison was built in 2001 and sat empty for five years because the state lacked the resources to open it. Despite being built as a maximum-security facility, it houses 144 minimum-security male inmates, according to the Illinois Department of Corrections Web site. Among the Guantanamo detainees are five with alleged ties to the September 11 conspiracy, including accused mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who will be transferred to New York for trial in civilian court.

"(CNN) -- The engineer who was operating the Metro-North train that derailed last year, killing four passengers and injuring dozens more, was suffering from a sleep disorder, according to documents released Monday by the National Transportation Safety Board. The NTSB's investigation discovered during a post-accident sleep evaluation that William Rockefeller Jr. had ""severe obstructive sleep apnea."" In a Metro-North medical history form from 1999, Rockefeller specifically answered ""no"" to a question asking whether he had difficulty sleeping, and at no point before the accident did any of his health care providers document a discussion with him regarding sleep problems, according to the NTSB's medical factual report of the investigation. However, after the derailment, a sleep study was ordered for Rockefeller because he ""did not exactly recall events leading up to the accident,"" the report said. The sleep specialist noted that Rockefeller's recent work schedule change from late night to early morning shifts ""might have contributed to the accident,"" according to an additional statement in the specialist's report. Sleep apnea is a disruptive sleep disorder in which a person's breathing repeatedly stops and starts. This can result in an individual feeling tired even after a full night's sleep. As a result, the sleep specialist prescribed Rockefeller continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as treatment. Rockefeller reported feeling more energetic after 30 days of treatment. ""My client was fully cooperative with the NTSB investigation, including giving them access to his medical records and doctors,"" Rockefeller's attorney, Jeffrey Chartier, said Monday. ""I believe these reports support that there was no criminality in regards to my client."" The accident happened on December 1 when the train of seven cars derailed while traveling from Poughkeepsie, New York, to Grand Central Terminal in New York City. The train was hurtling along at 82 mph, far above the speed limit of 30 mph for that section of track as it approached a sharp bend in the Bronx. The cars tumbled off the track, killing four passengers and leaving dozens more hospitalized. The lead car came to rest inches from water at the intersection of the Hudson and Harlem rivers. At the time of the accident, the train was in ""push mode,"" meaning that the locomotive was in the rear of the train pushing it along the tracks, with Rockefeller in a cabin at the front operating it remotely. His cabin was equipped with a ""dead man pedal"" that required constant downward pressure with the foot to keep the train moving, MTA spokesman Aaron Donovan told CNN last year. ""Should you lose consciousness or die, and the foot is taken off, a whistle sounds and the train begins to slow immediately to a stop,"" Donovan said. ""It's a pressure you have to keep -- your foot actively engaged."" But it is unclear whether the ""dead man pedal"" mechanism was activated when Rockefeller allegedly nodded off at the controls. ""That is unknown,"" Donovan said. ""MTA Metro-North Railroad is reviewing the documents released today by the NTSB,"" Donovan said Monday. ""The investigation is still ongoing, and Metro-North will continue to work with the NTSB on addressing their recommendations."" A safety review from the Federal Railroad Administration said Metro-North's focus on punctuality ""had a detrimental effect on safety, adversely affecting the inspection and maintenance of track and negatively impacting train operations,"" according to the report released in March. CNN's Lawrence Crook III and Haimy Assefa contributed to this report.","Engineer of Metro-North train that derailed was suffering from sleep apnea, NTSB report says .
