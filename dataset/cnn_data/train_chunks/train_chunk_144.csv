"Washington (CNN) -- There is no argument the Republican presidential field has breadth. From Mitt Romney, the former Republican governor of liberal Massachusetts, who needs to convince primary doubters of his core conservatism to Texas Rep. Ron Paul, sometimes called ""the intellectual godfather"" of the Tea Party, who needs to convince doubters that in his third run at the job he is more than a conversation-mover. It's largely a field of formers -- not a contemporary marquee name or a perfect fit in the bunch: . Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich -- a conservative big-idea guy, who often careens off-message and carries some personal baggage. He might be carrying his own actual baggage now since almost his entire senior campaign staff has bolted. An inside look at Monday's CNN debate . Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty -- like Romney, he has chief executive credibility, having maneuvered his way through two terms in one of the bluest states in the country, but he'll have to defend some of that record to a conservative base and work on upping his campaign skills to the national level. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum -- a favorite of social conservatives whose first pressing problem is convincing people he has a shot at powerhouse Team Obama. And the former CEO of Godfather's Pizza Herman Cain, a conservative radio host. Dismissed by Republican stalwarts as entertainment, he has nonetheless found some poll traction. Profiles of the seven GOP contenders . There is some question about depth -- almost 40% of Republicans say they're not satisfied with the field. Critics have called it weak but a top Republican strategist thinks it's more like wide-open, American style. ""People like to have a lot of choices when they go into the grocery store, and they are looking at cereals -- they want a big array of choices,"" said Ed Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee. ""The same is true for activists and others -- they want lots of choices and that will be the case until things are settled."" Social media at the debate . Tea Party star congresswoman Michele Bachman and Jon Huntsman, the former Utah governor and U.S. ambassador to China, are two of the premiere unsettled pieces of the Republican puzzle. But they need to get in now, if not earlier -- people are choosing sides, campaign money is finite and time is almost up. ""The Ames [Iowa] straw poll is less that three months away and it is the first real event of the primary cycle, so time is beginning, you know -- the calendar is beginning to accelerate,"" Gillespie said.

"(CNN) -- A federal court session for a man who tried to enter the United States allegedly with a veritable potpourri of weaponry and related paraphernalia was delayed Tuesday, leaving unanswered until a rescheduled hearing Friday questions about the man, his baggage and his intentions. Yongda Huang Harris, a U.S. citizen of Chinese decent, was detained in the international arrivals area of Los Angeles International Airport last Friday, and charged with one count of transporting hazardous materials. He faces a series of court dates, beginning with Friday's detention hearing. He won't enter a plea until October 29. Authorities were alerted at the airport about a man didn't look like the typical airline passenger. He stood out in his trench coach with a bulletproof vest, flame retardant pants and knee pads underneath. But it is what authorities said they found when they inspected the man's luggage that landed him in jail. A smoke grenade, knives, a hatchet, three billy clubs, a respirator and body bags were among the items in his checked bags. Harris' lawyer, Steve Seiden, declined CNN's request for comment Tuesday. Harris, 28, boarded a plane in Kansai, Japan, on Friday and made a stop in Inchon, Korea, before flying to the United States, according to a federal affidavit. Customs and Border Protection officers at LAX decided to pull Harris for secondary inspection. According to the affidavit, Harris was asked by customs enforcement officers if he wanted to amend his customs declaration form. Harris said he had a knife but didn't mention any other items, the court document states. The affidavit said that Harris' suitcases contained: . * A pyrotechnic smoke grenade capable of covering an area of 40,000 cubic feet with smoke . * Three lead-filled, leather-coated billy clubs . * A collapsible baton . * A full-face respirator . * Various knives and a hatchet . * Body bags . * A Tyvex biohazard suit and various masks . * Duct tape and batteries . * Oven mitts and cooking tongs . * Hand cuffs, leg irons, and plastic flexi-cuffs . * A device to repel dogs . Harris lives and works in Japan but has a permanent home in Boston, officials said. The charge against him could bring up to five years in prison upon conviction.","Man was arrested at LAX on Friday in international arrivals area .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Oklahoma have arrested and charged a 23-year-old man who they say planned to blow up 48 area churches. Gregory Arthur Weiler II was arrested last week at a motel in Miami, Oklahoma, according to Ben Loring, first assistant district attorney for Ottawa County. Authorities were tipped off to the plot by workers at the motel about 90 miles northeast of Tulsa. One discovered a duffel bag full of Molotov cocktails near the outside trash, while a room service employee reported suspicious items in Weiler's room, said Loring. Police searched the room and allegedly found various documents outlining his plan to set off bombs at 48 churches in and around Miami. Among the documents were a list of churches, a hand-drawn map with the churches grouped and circled, instructions for making Molotov cocktails and a handwritten journal, said Loring. Some of the documents had been torn up and needed to be assembled. Loring said one of the journal entries read as follows: ""Self-Promote for the next 4 years while beginning list of goals written out in Oklahoma having to do with destroying and removing church buildings from U.S., a tiny bit at a time -- setting foundation for the years to follow."" Authorities also recovered 50 brown glass bottles with cloth wicks attached by duct tape, a funnel and a 5-gallon gasoline can, Loring said. Weiler was charged Friday with threatening to use an explosive or incendiary device and violating the Oklahoma Anti-Terrorism Act. He is being held without bond. Weiler appeared in court Monday and was appointed representation -- attorneys Andrew Meloy and Daniel Giraldi, said Loring. Both work at the Hartley Law Firm. A woman answering the phone there said that the office would have no comment. The suspect, who is from Illinois, is expected to appear in court next on October 22.

"(CNN) -- The Florida Highway Patrol defended its role in a fiery multi-car crash on Florida's Interstate 75 in Gainesville, where 11 people died and 46 were injured due to heavy fog and smoke from a nearby fire. In a report prepared by the FHP and the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, the agencies concluded the drivers killed and injured in the January accidents were responsible for their actions by continuing to drive through the dense smoke. ""Despite the presence of Fog/Smoke warning signs, some drivers did not take proper precautions and slow their speeds to prepare for reduced visibility,"" said the report. The report also concluded patrol officers acted fairly when they made the decision to reopen the interstate after monitoring smoke and fog drifting through the area. ""The FHP's review of the events of January 29, 2012, found its members acted reasonably,"" the report said in its conclusion. ""The rapidly changing conditions that morning in such a localized area could not be predicted with any degree of reliability."" The accidents occurred in the early morning hours outside Gainesville as smoke from a nearby brush fire enveloped the highway. The FHP increased its staffing from two troopers to eight after acknowledging the danger the nearby fire posed, the report stated. After monitoring the roadway conditions throughout the night, the agency reopened a section of I-75 after the on-site incident commander determined the roadway's conditions were clear. ""Response personnel continued to drive through the area at approximately 10-minute intervals and noted no significant smoke or fog until the time the crashes occurred,"" the report said. Barely half an hour later, a chain reaction of crashes involving at least 25 vehicles, including semi trucks, would occur. 911 calls from that evening reveal panicked voices and sickening crunches as cars careened into accidents that hadn't had enough time to be cleared from the scene. After Gov. Rick Scott ordered an investigation into the cause of the horrific crash, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement released a report in April to detail the FHP's role in the deadly pileup. The FDLE found that while there was no criminal intent involved, the FHP did need to revamp its policies and procedures in such situations, and improve its inter-agency communication. ""Even if each of the recommendations made by the FDLE in its incident review were to have been present or occurred that night, it is probable the same decision would have been reached. Also, no amount of planning or policy will take the place of driver reaction to low visibility and unpredictable conditions,"" the FHP said in the report released Friday. As conditions improved onsite commander FHP Lt. John Gourley decided to reopen the highway despite fellow deputy Sgt. Bruce Simmons warning that conditions could quickly deteriorate. """"This would not have happened,"" said Simmons as captured on his dashboard camera while speaking to an Alachua County deputy sheriff. ""They wouldn't freaking listen earlier. That's what I told my lieutenant. That's what I told my lieutenant. I said that it (smoke) will roll in faster than you can shut it down,"" said Simmons. Many of the FDLE's recommended changes have been accepted, including improved training, procedures and guidelines when opening or closing roads along with better communications with the National Weather Service and the Florida Forest Service for the latest information on how smoke is affecting state highways. ""The Patrol has reviewed the events of the crash and is enhancing policies and training to advance our mission to promote a safe and secure Florida through professional law enforcement and traffic safety awareness,"" said FHP director Col. David Brierton in a written statement. ""The crashes on Interstate 75 in Alachua County in the early morning hours of Jan. 29, 2012, were tragic, and our prayers go out to the families involved.""","Florida Highway Patrol releases its report on crashes .

"(Departures ) -- The Skypark pool atop the Marina Bay Sands hotel in Singapore might be one of the most magnificent pools on earth: It's an infinity-edged oasis 650 feet above ground with a mind-blowing view of the city's skyline. It's part of a massive rooftop entertainment platform perched atop three skyscrapers. While it may vie for the most dramatic, this high-altitude hot spot is now one of many built in major metropolises. These days pools are popping up on top of skyscrapers from New York to Sydney and everywhere in between, often with bars and restaurants that help transform the pool deck into a social scene all its own. ""In densely populated cities where space is at a such a premium, if you want to build something new and innovative, the only place to go is up,"" says Thompson Toronto project architect Rob Cadeau, who turned the hotel's rooftop into a gathering place by designing a bar adjacent to the pool area. Other designers have used increasingly dramatic effects -- infinity edges, cantilevered pool tanks, see-through flooring -- in order to distinguish and gain international attention for their offerings. ""Every time someone does something new, someone else has to up the ante,"" says Cadeau. ""In the future, we're going to see even more acrobatic engineering on rooftops, features that will stretch our perception of the pool edge, the height and the sensations you experience once you're swimming."" The trend to create entertainment hubs above the hectic urban bustle started a decade ago in New York, where 35 hotels now feature a rooftop bar, many of which have pools. Boutique properties like the Soho House were the first to get in on the action, and other hotels followed suit, from Hotel Frasano's Phillipe Starck-designed rooftop pool in Rio de Janeiro to the Joule in Dallas, where part of the pool hangs off the building. Eventually the laws of physics may keep designers from pushing the envelope any further. In the meantime -- the sky's the limit. Departures.com: 10 stunning hotel penthouses . Marina Bay Sands, Singapore . The infinity pool at Marina Bay Sands soars a hair-raising 650 feet in the air, overlooking the Singapore skyline. The expansive ""SkyPark"" deck and observation platform (large enough to fit three football fields) is perched 55 floors up on a platform that connects the hotel's three skyscrapers. Guests who aren't content to swim or lounge can paraglide off the side. marinabaysands.com. Hotel Fasano, Rio de Janeiro . This Phillipe Starck-designed rooftop pool deck is a feast for the eyes, from dramatic views of Ipanema beach and Two Brothers mountain to Starck's sculptural installation of ear-shaped mirrors. Naturally even the guests are worth a glance: Madonna, Kevin Spacey and P. Diddy have all been spotted poolside. To help loungers stay cool as the people-watching heats up, the bar mixes specialty caipirinhas and freshly squeezed tropical juices. The hotel recently opened a Vichy shower room adjacent to the pool, which offers body wraps, massages and after-sun treatments by Spa Fasano and renowned Brazilian spa therapist Renata de Abreu. fasano.com.br. The Joule, Dallas . When movie mogul Tim Headington, who has bankrolled such films as Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed"" and ""The Aviator,"" built a pool on the tenth-floor rooftop of his downtown Dallas hotel, he opted for a little Hollywood-style drama, extending the pool eight feet out and over the side of the building, complete with an aquarium-like glass wall at the end overlooking the street. On warmer weekends The Joule hosts parties on the pool deck, which is complete with cabanas and a menu from the Charlie Palmer restaurant downstairs. Not outrageous enough? The poolside loungers can request an SPF application from the onsite tanning butler. thejouledallas.com. InterContinental Hong Kong . In a city with no shortage of IMAX-worthy hotel views, the one from the InterContinental demands a mention. Visitors can take in views of Victoria Harbour and nearby Hong Kong Island from one of three temperature-controlled infinity spa pools on the third floor pool terrace, which is open to all guests. Guests rotate between hot, warm and cold plunges on the 30,000-square-foot deck while a butler lingers nearby with a selection of beverages and facials mists. For those who need further relaxing after their swim, the feng shui--based Ancient Rituals of the Orient treatment at I-Spa, located steps from the pool, is guaranteed to do the trick. The hotel also has a Presidential Suite and a CEO suite, which both have a private swimming pool and jacuzzi. hongkong-ic.intercontinental.com. Ritz Carlton Hong Kong . This indoor pool stands a dizzying 1,500 feet above the street, offering a bird's-eye view of Hong Kong Island. It also features 144 LED screens installed in the ceiling that display video and images, a hot and cold plunge area and an outdoor Jacuzzi. The pool shares the floor with OZONE, the highest bar in the world (rivaled only by at.mosphere in Dubai's Burj Khalifa). Head over to check out the space-age decor and take part in the drinking and dancing. ritzcarlton.com/hongkong. Departures.com: 25 top travel apps . Soho House, New York City . When it opened in Manhattan's emerging Meatpacking District in 2003, the heated top-floor pool at this members-only club instantly became the city's most exclusive destination. Despite a nearly decade-long cooling off period, the buzz remains: the black-and-white-striped lounge chairs beside the pool are still prime real estate. While the pool has stayed members-only, visitors can gain access by booking one of the 24 rooms in the hotel below. sohohouseny.com. Hotel Unique, São Paulo . The best time to pay a visit to this pool, poised atop one of São Paulo's most cosmopolitan new design hotels, is after dark. That's when the unparalleled views of the city's downtown skyline and the colorfully lit pool water glow brightest as guests nibble from the sashimi menu and sip wasabi martinis. Still, even the most determined loungers will want to dive in: music is pumped through the pool via an underwater sound system. hotelunique.com. Thompson Toronto . Thompson Hotel execs took advantage of the city's relatively mild weather and designed their 16th-floor oasis to maximize their guests' access to the outdoors. ""We built the infinity pool on a raised platform, so you're at eye level with the water the second you step out of the elevator,"" says Rob Cadeau, whose team oriented the entire deck to face east so it would feature an unobstructed sightline toward downtown. During warmer months, the glass wall between the indoor bar and outdoor pool retracts to create one large space for mixing and mingling. thompsonhotels.com/hotels/Toronto. The Viceroy, Miami . Miami is famous for its exceptional pools, so it takes a truly over-the-top one to impress. The one on the roof of The Viceroy is no slouch: Its two-acre pool deck connects the three towers of the Icon Brickell complex and has a 300-foot infinity pool that appears to drop off into Biscayne Bay, 15 stories below. The outdoor recreation area offers 12 cabanas and 200 chaise lounges, a life-sized chess set and a thermal hot tub that seats 80 people. Don't miss the late-night scene at Club 50.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for an early election after failing to agree on a budget with his coalition partners, saying the vote should be held ""as soon as possible"" for the good of the country. In a televised announcement Tuesday, Netanyahu said the election was necessary to ensure ""a responsible security and economic policy"" in the face of the economic downturn and threats to Israel's security from Iran and elsewhere. The election will ideally happen in three months' time, he said, rather than in October 2013, as originally scheduled. ""It is my obligation as the prime minister to put the national interest above everything else,"" Netanyahu said. Read more: Israel eyes Lebanon after drone downed . ""So I have decided that it is in the best interest for the state of Israel to go to elections now and as soon as possible."" Read more: Israel's red line not in line with U.S. view . Netanyahu said he had concluded after talks with the heads of the other parties in his coalition that it was not currently possible to pass a ""responsible budget with a long-term outlook"" for Israel. ""We are at the start of an election year and I am sorry that during an election year it is difficult for parties to put the national interest above the party interest,"" he said. ""The result of this could be the breaking of the budget and a massive increase in the deficit which will force us very quickly into the position of the economies that are disintegrating in Europe. I won't let that happen here."" Researchers at the Bank of Israel predicted in September that Israel's economic growth this year would come in at 3.3%, versus 3.0% next year. Inflation through the end of the third quarter of 2013 was forecast to be 2.6%. According to Israel's Haaretz newspaper, the planned budget included between 13 and 15 billion shekels in cuts, with wage reductions for public sector workers and infrastructure projects to be slashed. The Jerusalem Post said the proposed cuts totaled between 15 billion and 17 billion shekels. Two coalition partners, the ultra-Orthodox party Shas and Yisrael Beytenu, Avigdor Lieberman's nationalist party, were against cuts being imposed on lower earners, including young families and families with many children. Defense Minister Ehud Barak, leader of the Independence Party, was against any cuts in the defense budget. Without those three coalition partners on board, Netanyahu had little chance of getting the budget through the Knesset, the Israeli parliament. Netanyahu hopes his right-wing Likud party will come out of the snap election with more seats in the Knesset and a stronger hold on the coalition. The centrist political faction Kadima, led by Shaul Mofaz, may lose out in a new vote. Outlining the security challenges currently facing Israel, Netanyahu said: ""We have to ensure Iran does not get nuclear weapons, guard our borders from terror and migration, to guard the peace agreements with our neighbors, to stand on the vital interests in all future negotiations for peace and to ensure a dynamic and growing economy that will guard the work place for the citizens of Israel."" Iran has repeatedly insisted that its nuclear program is for peaceful, civilian energy purposes only. But it has rebuffed demands to halt its production of enriched uranium, and a 2011 report by the United Nations' nuclear watchdog found ""credible"" information that Tehran has carried out work toward nuclear weapons -- including tests of possible bomb components. Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly this year, Netanyahu said time was quickly running out to find a diplomatic solution to the impasse. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","Israel needs a ""responsible budget with a long-term outlook,"" Netanyahu says .

"(CNN Student News) -- January 4, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Yemen  • Iran . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hi! Happy new year! We hope you had a wonderful break. My name is Carl Azuz, and CNN Student News is kicking off 2010 right here, right now. First Up: National Security . AZUZ: First up, the U.S. government closes its embassy in the Middle Eastern country of Yemen, and that is because of security concerns. One official says that a group called al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula might be planning an attack against the facility. That same group said it was behind an attempted plot to set off an explosive onboard a plane heading to Detroit, Michigan. That took place on Christmas day. The suspect allegedly brought the explosives on the plane in his underwear. The plan failed when the device he tried to use didn't detonate correctly. Some people have asked how the suspect made it past security. One U.S. official says it's because of human error. President Obama has promised that everyone involved in the attack will be held accountable for it. But some critics argue that the president's response to the situation hasn't been fast enough, hasn't been aggressive enough. The president also announced that the suspect was trained by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. That's the same terrorist group we mentioned before. The U.S. military has been working with the government of Yemen for a while to fight al Qaeda terrorists. Barbara Starr looks at how that fight has played out in the past. (BEGIN VIDEO) BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Yemeni forces earlier this month on a raid against al Qaeda just north of the capital of Sana'a. The military shouts, ""Come out. It is better for you. Do not be afraid."" Shots are fired and several suspects are finally captured. This was one of Yemen's efforts to hit back at al Qaeda. U.S. assistance with several recent strikes that may have killed some of these men is now openly acknowledged. ABU BAKR AL-QIRBI, YEMENI FOREIGN MINISTER: They are Yemeni armed forces attacks. They were, of course, supported by American intelligence and by the training of the Yemeni armed forces. STARR: What's next? The U.S. military and the intelligence community are looking at everything they have got on al Qaeda in Yemen. Strikes are expected to continue and could involve U.S. missiles or aircraft, sources say. The U.S. and Yemen are looking for targets linked to the attack of Northwest flight 253. But direct retaliation hasn't always worked. FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON: Our target was terror. Our mission was clear. There will be no sanctuary for terrorists. STARR: In 1998, after al Qaeda attacked U.S. embassies in east Africa, President Clinton ordered cruise missile attacks against targets in Afghanistan. But al Qaeda was untouched; key operatives had long fled the area. U.S. retaliation that worked: it happened in Yemen back in 2002. A U.S. drone fired a missile. One of the dead was an al Qaeda operative believed to have been behind the October 2000 attack on the Navy warship Cole in Yemen that killed 17 sailors. Even now, the U.S. is continuing to provide training, weapons and intelligence to the Yemeni forces. But if President Obama decides to strike back in retaliation for the botched attack on the Northwest Airlines flight, there will be a target list for him to approve. Barbara Starr, CNN, the Pentagon. (END VIDEO) Is this Legit? RICK VINCENT, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? About a third of the world's population is Christian. Legit! According to the U.S. government, approximately 33 percent of the global population is Christian, making Christianity the world's largest religion. Christmas Celebrated . AZUZ: And of course, Christians around the world celebrated Christmas on December 25th, marking the birth of Jesus. One of those celebrations, which you see right here, was held in the city of Bethlehem, the site where Jesus was born. Worshippers gathered at the Church of the Nativity for a ceremony there. And at the Vatican, Pope Benedict XVI led the traditional Christmas Eve Mass. There was a disruption at the beginning, though, when a woman ran toward the pope and knocked him down. The religious leader wasn't hurt. He was helped up and continued with the ceremony, while Vatican guards removed the woman. Iran Protests . AZUZ: A holy day in Iran marked by violence as protesters clashed with police forces about a week ago. Demonstrators have spoken out against the country's government for months now, but the clashes on the Muslim holy day of Ashura were the worst so far. At least seven people killed in the violence, though protesters and security forces disagree on how those deaths happened. Meantime, Iran's government says it's getting ready to hold a ""large-scale military exercise"" next month. The country says the goal is to prepare its forces to fight against an attack by the nation's enemies. There's been a lot of tension based around Iran's nuclear program. The country says the program is for peaceful purposes. Other countries, including the U.S., believe Iran might be trying to build nuclear weapons. Health Care Debate . AZUZ: Members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives will be meeting this month to put together a final health care reform bill. The Senate passed its version on Christmas Eve. The House had already passed its bill. But there are some pretty big differences between the two. One of them: cost. The Senate bill checks in at $871 billion. The House version: Over $1 trillion. Another issue: the so-called public option, a government-run health insurance program. House bill includes it; Senate bill doesn't. So, some compromises need to be made to come up with a final bill. And since that then has to be approved by both Houses of Congress, there are some concerns about whether it will pass. Money Word . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Here's the deal: Today's Money Word is depression. It describes an extreme decline in economic activity, and it is much worse than a recession. Put that in your word bank! Jobs Prospects 2010 . AZUZ: The U.S. avoided slipping into a depression during the recent financial crisis, but it did end up in a recession. You know it; you heard about it all last semester. Now, when that economic decline started in December 2007, the number of Americans who were out of a job was around 5 percent. By last November, that number had doubled. Kitty Pilgrim examines what might lie ahead in 2010. (BEGIN VIDEO) KITTY PILGRIM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Happy New Year. More than 15 million people in the country are unemployed; many of them lost their jobs in 2009. What's ahead for 2010? Elena Escalona, who spoke to us late last year about her career hopes after sending out dozens of resumes and searching for a job, she suddenly realized what she wanted to do in life. ELENA ESCALONA, SEARCHING FOR A JOB: Luckily, out of all of this and something really positive that has come out of it is that I've discovered that I want to become a teacher. And I think I would have never discovered that out of, you know, this entire year of looking for a job. That instead of having a job physically handed to me, I've really had to fight for it and kind of, you know, discovered where I belong in the world. PILGRIM: As the unemployed site-surf and soul search, there is some glimmer of hope. The last report in December found that new claims for unemployment benefits fell sharply, down by 22,000. That was the lowest level since July 2008. And the four-week average of people who filed for benefits has been declining for 17 weeks straight. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We are in a very different place today than we were one year ago. We may forget, but we're in a very different place. We can safely say that we are no longer facing the potential collapse of our financial system and we've avoided the depression many feared. Our economy is growing for the first time in a year. PILGRIM: Next week will also provide a good snapshot of how manufacturing and service sectors held up in December. As the economy gradually recovers from the worst recession since the Great Depression, going from cutting jobs to creating them is a slow adjustment. Businesses are likely to be cautious, fully convinced in recovery before adding any new hires. DR. MARTIN REGALIA, U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE CHIEF ECONOMIST: We're out of the recession everywhere, but we're not growing enough on Main Street to put people back to work. When the average person thinks of a recession, they don't think of it like economists do, you know, zero GDP growth or whatever. They think of it as, you know, ""Am I losing my job? Am I getting a raise?"" PILGRIM: Kitty Pilgrim, CNN. (END VIDEO) Promo . AZUZ: Well, if you're still looking for a New Year's resolution, why not make us your home page?

"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was re-elected Sunday to a new six-year term, overcoming an energetic challenge by a candidate backed by an opposition coalition, according to nearly complete results announced by election officials. Chavez, who has been president since 1999, defeated Henrique Capriles Radonski, whose campaign criticized the Chavez administration for inefficiencies, infrastructure shortcomings and corruption. Chavez highlighted his accomplishments in housing, education and health initiatives and acknowledged he needed to do more on crime and government bureaucracy. With 90% of the ballots counted Sunday night, Chavez has 54.42% of the vote compared with 44.97% for Capriles, according to Tibisay Lucena, president of the National Electoral Council. Chavez had secured 7.4 million votes and Capriles 6.1 million votes, election officials said. The country saw one of its highest participation rates in decades, with almost 81% of voters going to the polls, Lucena said. In fact, some polls were kept open two hours after their scheduled closing because lines of voters were waiting for ballots. As throughout the day, the army was still deployed Sunday evening and was standing by throughout the country to ensure a peaceful and secure vote, said Maj. Gen. Wilmer Barrientos, commander of strategic operations command. Earlier in the evening, Chavez thanked his campaign staff in a phone call aired on state-run television at mid-evening and asked people to remain calm until the election results were completed. Chavez said people were still voting in some places. ""Let us wait for the results patiently, calmly and prepare ourselves to accept the results whatever they may be,"" he said. ""This will be a triumph for democracy,"" he added. He asked that there be no violence. Long lines began forming in the early morning hours at polling stations from remote regions of the Amazon to the bustling capital of Caracas. One election official, Rosalin Montiel, told state-run television that polling stations in the municipality of San Francisco in the state of Zulia would remain open past the schedule closing time -- ""until the last elector casts his vote."" Nearly 140,000 troops were deployed throughout the country to guard polls and keep the peace, state-run VTV reported. By mid-afternoon, Barrientos reported 15 electoral offenses throughout the entire country, the Venezuelan military said on its Twitter account. No further details were immediately available. After casting his ballot, Chavez called on Venezuelans to vote and remain calm. ""Have no doubt that we will respect the results, whatever they are. ... We have to recognize the results,"" he told reporters. After casting his vote, Capriles said governors nationwide had reported ""massive participation, demonstrating one more time that Venezuelans want to resolve our differences through democratic means."" He told reporters that ""whatever the people say today, for me, is sacred,"" and said he would push for national unity after the results are released. ""There will be a winner. There will a president-elect. But there will not be a defeated people,"" he said. ""Tomorrow, we are only one country, only one Venezuela. Tomorrow in the country there are many problems that we have to resolve. Problems do not wait."" On the eve of the election, Chavez -- who is facing the strongest challenge to his 13-year-rule -- stressed that the election would be free and fair and called on people across the political spectrum to ""prepare emotionally"" for Sunday's result. ""It won't be the end of the world for anybody,"" he said. Chavez has dismissed his much younger challenger as a ""fly"" not worth chasing, when challenged to a debate earlier this year. The president's critics were confident that Capriles could unseat the long-ruling leftist leader, a refrain previously heard before eventual defeats. Yet the incumbent is a political survivor and remains popular at home. But there were signals, observers said, that this time Chavez really was on the ropes. Chavez's influence over Latin America's left-leaning governments has often rankled the United States, Venezuela's largest trading partner. Venezuela is the fourth-largest exporter of oil to the United States. Despite that tight economic relationship, the two countries are not exactly close allies: Chavez often rails against the U.S. and its allies as ""imperialists."" Further complicating the U.S.-Venezuela relationship is how Chavez is allied with Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, defended former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and has even offered his support for Syria's leader Bashar al-Assad. At stake for Venezuelans is the ideological trajectory of their country. Chavez, 58, has had more than a decade to implement his vision of 21st century socialism, a view that emphasizes use of state oil windfalls to fund social programs. Observers say Capriles, 40, represents a moderate alternative. He has vowed not to end the social programs that Chavez has set up, and he promises to fight corruption that has grown in the public sector. The candidates offer two distinct paths to solve the problems that are on Venezuelans minds: decaying infrastructure, high crime rates and political polarization. The election also drew voters from beyond the country's borders as thousands of Venezuelans living abroad lined up to cast their ballots at diplomatic offices. In New Orleans, Louisiana, voters streamed into the Venezuelan Consulate. Many traveled by bus from Miami, where Venezuelan authorities closed a consulate in January after the United States expelled the office's top Venezuelan diplomat. In Caracas, voters said they were happy to be casting their ballots. ""I'm really proud of the people, because everyone is cheerful about this event and I think there is a good feeling,"" said Jesus Betancourt, a 25-year-old student. Standing outside the Caracas school where Chavez cast his ballot, Katherene Rivas said she hoped Venezuelans would respect the results. ""For now, everything is quiet here, and we want that after the results are announced, that people remain calm,"" she said. Journalist Osmary Hernandez and CNN's Mariano Castillo, Paula Newton, Gustavo Valdes, Helena DeMoura, Patricia Janiot, Rafael Romo, Michael Martinez and Richard Singer contributed to this report.","NEW: With 90% of ballots counted, Chavez has 54% of the vote, officials say .

"(CNN) -- Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-serving monarch, celebrated his 84th birthday Monday, giving the Southeast Asian country some much-needed cheer after months of devastating flooding nationwide. Also celebrated as Father's Day, the occasion launched a week of national celebrations, including a birthday speech by Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra on behalf of the Thai people, a public audience by the king during a grand state ceremony and the pardon of some 26,000 prisoners. A new book celebrating his seventh decade as monarch has also hit stores. Titled ""King Bhumibol Adulyadej: A Life's Work,"" and with an editorial advisory board chaired by former Prime Minister Anand Panyarachun, the book offers a look at the king's life, work, laws governing the throne, along with hundreds of pictures. In a rare appearance, the king on Monday addressed the recent floods that have devastated the country, urging people to overcome divisions and set up sustainable water management. ""It is a duty of everyone to cooperate and help each other,"" he said. The U.S.-born and Swiss-educated king has reigned since 1950, succeeding his brother King Ananda Mahidol, whose death in 1946 of a gunshot wound in bed remains a mystery. Also known as Rama IX, the king commands great love, respect and God-like status among Thais despite his lack of direct power under Thailand's constitutional monarchy, in which decision-making rests with the prime minister. The Constitution stipulates that the king ""shall be enthroned in a position of revered worship and shall not be violated"" and that ""no person shall expose the king to any sort of accusation or action."" He has wielded his moral authority to intervene in political crises over the decades, but his failing health -- he has been residing at Bangkok's Siriraj Hospital -- has raised questions about the country's future, as it struggles to recover from the most recent spasms of political unrest in the aftermath of a 2006 military coup. His son, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, is his heir apparent. But talk about the future role of the monarchy -- most especially if it's deemed less than supportive -- has been hampered by Thailand's lese majeste laws, which ban criticism of the monarchy. Last week, Human Rights Watch urged the amendment of Thailand's lese majeste laws after 61-year-old Ampon Tangnoppakul was sentenced to 20 years in prison for sending four SMS text messages considered offensive to the Queen and the monarchy -- a case that also drew the concern of the European Union. ""The severity of penalties being meted out for lese majeste offenses in Thailand is shocking,"" said Human Rights Watch's Asia Director, Brad Adams on the HRW web site. The group pointed to the King's own 2005 birthday speech in suggesting he invited criticism: ""If the King can do no wrong, it is akin to looking down upon him because the King is not being treated as a human being. But the King can do wrong,"" according to a translation by the Thai newspaper, The Nation. The U.N. Special Rapporteur has recommended the amendment of Thailand's lese majeste laws. On Monday The Nation released a Dusit survey on the king. Among the findings: 60 percent of those polled most appreciate his kindness for the economy; 78 percent pledged to be honest in honor of his birthday; 61 percent would like to light candles and sing songs to wish him well; and 73 percent believe disunity most upsets the king. In addition to Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, King Bhumibol and his wife of more than 60 years, Queen Sirikit, have three other children: Ubolratana, Chulabhorn, and Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, whose work promoting schools, nutrition and health care for the needy has earned her the nickname ""Angel Princess.""","Thai King's 84th birthday sparks a week of celebrations .

"(CNN) -- Re-elected U.S. President Barack Obama must do more to engage with ""frustrated"" big business in his second term, according to Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the world's largest advertising agency. The boss of WPP -- a multinational marketing and public relations company -- told CNN: ""As a foreign observer, I can't recall any male or female CEO saying they wanted Obama to win. Very few did. Read more: Five things Obama must do . ""Business is looking for closer engagement with the administration,"" he added. Sorrell also said that corporates will be watching closely how the Democrat president handles the country's looming fiscal cliff. U.S. lawmakers face $7 trillion worth of cuts to spending and tax increases over a decade, which could significantly impact on the U.S. economy and its credit rating. ""The key issue is the fiscal cliff, as close as January 1... We have to wait until the inauguration, until the administration is put into place."" The presidential election in the U.S. and the economic slowdown in China has created a cocktail of uncertainty, according to Sorrell. Read more: U.S. fiscal cliff risks dragging global economy into darkness . This, along with instability in the Middle East and a struggling eurozone, added to an already nervous corporate sector. Sorrell said: ""We've seen considerable uncertainty, particularly in the third-quarter, many companies-missing their top line forecasts if not their bottom-line forecasts."" There was a ""quantum change"" in clients' attitudes toward discretionary spending in the third quarter of the year, he added. But the British CEO -- who formerly worked for the Saatchi brothers -- sees investors becoming more ""bullish"" over the prospects for the U.S. in the long-term. Sorrell noted there were also ""two big positives for the U.S. over the next 20 years."" There were self-sufficiency in oil and gas and the competitive position in manufacturing, he said.

"(CNN) -- A British professor who was key to improving Formula One's safety has died at the age of 84. Sid Watkins, who was a close friend of the late Ayrton Senna, was involved in F1 for a quarter of a century, helping to save the lives of drivers such as Rubens Barrichello and Mika Hakkinen following high-speed crashes. ""This is a truly sad day for the FIA family and the entire motor sport community,"" FIA president Jean Todt said in a statement released by motorsport's global governing body. ""Sid was loved and respected in equal measure by all those who knew and worked with him. We will always be grateful for the safety legacy that he has left our sport."" F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone brought Watkins into the sport in 1978 during an era when fatalities in the sport were all too frequent. ""Watkins worked tirelessly to improve that situation, helping bring universal standards to circuit medical centres, teams and cars, and making the presence of a medical helicopter mandatory at F1 events,"" said the sport's official website. The Liverpool-born former neurologist is perhaps best known for his friendship with legendary Brazilian driver Senna. Watkins tended to the three-time drivers' champion following his fatal crash at Imola in 1994. Senna's nephew Bruno, currently a driver for Williams, used his Twitter account to say: ""RIP Prof. Sid Watkins. Sad news for us who stay behind."" During that fateful Imola weekend, after seeing Aryton Senna's reaction to the death of another driver -- Austrian Roland Ratzenberger -- as well another serious accident involving the Brazilian's compatriot Barrichello, Watkins had advised Senna to quit the sport, asking him: ""What else do you need to do? ""You've been world champion three times. You are obviously the quickest driver. Give it up and let's go fishing"". Former Ferrari driver Barrichello also expressed his sadness and gratitude, saying: ""It was Sid Watkins that saved my life in Imola 94. Great guy to be with, always happy...thanks for everything you have done for us drivers. RIP."" McLaren's British pairing of Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button also took to Twitter to express their condolences. ""It's a sad day, with the loss of professor Sid Watkins,"" said 2008 champion Hamilton. ""Without his incredible contribution to the sport, our lives as drivers would be a risk. My condolences go out to his family."" Button wins in Belgium in race marred by spectacular first corner crash . Button, a title winner in 2009, said: ""Rest in Peace Sid Watkins...Motorsport wouldn't be what it is today without you. Thank you for all you've done, we as drivers are so grateful."" In recognition of his work Watkins, who was affectionally known as ""the Prof"", was made the first president of the FIA institute after he left F1 in 2005. He retained an honorary presidential role following his retirement last year. ""Sid was a true gentleman of our sport and always a pleasure to work with,"" said current FIA Institute president Gerard Saillant. ""He will be sorely missed by everyone who knew him, from doctors and drivers to officials and fans. Sid's influence will live on for many years to come.""","Motorsport safety expert Sid Watkins passes away aged 84 .

"(CNN) -- Joshua Scowcroft has lived through some intense winter weather in the decade he's lived in Vermont. But this winter -- which offered an encore Monday in the form of up to 30 inches of snow -- takes the cake. ""This is the snowiest, craziest winter I have ever seen in my life,"" he told CNN on Tuesday, after hand-shoveling enough snow to create a 7-foot pile by the driveway. ""Between brutally cold days of negative 20 with the wind, then two days where the temperature hit 50 and 30 inches of snow in 24 or 48 hours, this is one for the books,"" Scowcroft said. The storm -- the same system that brought tornadoes to Louisiana earlier in the week -- dumped up to 30 inches of snow on parts of Vermont, New York and Maine. It also brought heavy rain to parts of Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Virginia and prompted flood warnings and watches as far south as Georgia, according to CNN meteorologist Monica O'Connor. In Burlington, where the National Weather Service officially reported 17.1 inches of snow but posted reports of up to 30 inches in places, Christopher Reynolds was still cooped up on Tuesday, if comfortably, ""with plenty of food for a week if need be."" ""It's great to see the sun today -- very pretty with all the pine trees hanging low with their thick coating of snow,"" he said. Although many roads were clear, Reynolds and his family were still stuck Tuesday because the family snow removal contractor spent much of the day rescuing people from the snow or getting stuck himself, Reynolds said. By the time he arrived Monday night, he could get only halfway up their driveway before he had to quit. The snow comes as an unwelcome coda to winter for Vermont, where the 43 inches recorded in February set a record for the month, according to the O'Connor. That being said, heavy March snow is not unheard of in the state -- the record for the month is 47.6 inches, she said. While the snow was a nuisance, flooding was the greater threat throughout parts of the Northeast. High water from intense rain caused major flooding along the Housatonic and Still rivers in Connecticut, as well as minor or moderate flooding along the Connecticut, Farmington, Quinnipiac and Pomperaug rivers. In Oxford, Connecticut, video from CNN affiliate WTNH showed fast-moving floodwater rising almost to the doorknobs of some homes. Oxford resident A.J. Monaco told the station that the water rose too quickly for him to get anything out of the house. ""Came out of nowhere,"" he said. ""Next thing you know I have 3 feet of water and I had no time to do anything but lock up the house, jump in the truck and watch the water accumulate higher and higher."" Up to 2 1/2 inches of rain are forecast for parts of Connecticut on Thursday, raising the threat of additional flooding in the western part of the state, according to the state Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security. The storm also could bring a bit more snow to Vermont.","Up to 30 inches of snow fall on parts of the Northeast .

"(CNN) -- The growing Hispanic population in the United States has reached a new milestone, topping 50 million, or 16.3% of the nation, officially solidifying its position as the country's second-largest group, U.S. Census Bureau officials said Thursday. ""Overall, we've learned that our nation's population has become more racially and ethnically diverse over the past 10 years,"" said Nicholas A. Jones, chief of the bureau's racial statistics branch. Several trends emerged from the 2010 census, according to Robert M. Groves, director of the Census Bureau, and Marc J. Perry, chief of the population distribution branch. The country is growing at a smaller rate. Growth is concentrated in metropolitan areas and in the American West and South. The fastest-growing communities are suburbs such as Lincoln, California, outside Sacramento. And standard-bearer cities such as Boston, Baltimore and Milwaukee are no longer in the top 20 for population, replaced by upstarts such as El Paso, Texas, and Charlotte, North Carolina, the officials said. The most significant trend, however, appeared to be the nation's new count of 50.5 million Latinos, whose massive expansion accounted for more than half of the nation's overall growth of 27.3 million people, to a new overall U.S. population of 308.7 million, officials said. The Hispanic population grew 43% since 2000, officials said. In stark contrast, all other populations together grew by only about 5%, officials said. The nation as a whole expanded by 9.7%. Bureau officials declined Thursday to say how much illegal immigration has spurred growth among Latinos and other minorities, saying the sources of the growth are still being studied. ""Those are actually very excellent questions,"" said Roberto Ramirez, chief of the bureau's ethnicity and ancestry branch. ""We are actually in the middle of the process of investigating that."" D'Vera Cohn, a senior writer at the Pew Research Center in Washington, said the birth rate, rather than immigration, is the primary driving factor in the Latino boom. Hispanics now account for nearly one-quarter of children under the age of 18, Cohn said. ""Hispanics are a younger population, and there are just more women of a child-bearing age,"" she said. Although immigration remains a major contributor to Hispanic population growth, the recent recession and high employment rates may have prompted a tapering off in the rate of foreign-born nationals seeking U.S. residence, analysts said. Intensified border patrols may have reduced illegal immigration, but those measures ""remain at the margins,"" said William Frey, a demographer at The Brookings Institution. He added that America's overall undocumented immigrant population -- estimated at between 10 million and 11 million people -- may have even declined in recent years, though accurate numbers are difficult to acquire. While Latinos are evidence of a growing voting bloc, they may not necessarily spur immigration reform in Congress, which has been paralyzed politically for years on whether to reform immigration laws or roll out additional crackdowns such as a beefed-up border patrol, said one immigrant rights advocate in Arizona. ""We hope these census numbers signal a new era of racial politics in our states, rooted not only in strong economies but also equalities for all people,"" said Jennifer Allen, executive director of the human rights organization Border Action Network. Home to the busiest border crossing for illegal immigration, Arizona has been the nation's hotbed for several laws targeting illegal immigrants, including the much-publicized Senate Bill 1070 that is now being challenged on constitutional grounds in federal court because one of its controversial provisions allows racial profiling by police, critics charge. Several states have tried to pass measures similar to Arizona's, but not with much success, Allen asserted. The census figures may dampen further immigration crackdowns in Arizona because the new population count ""demonstrates the growing importance of Latino voters throughout the state,"" Allen said. As the census figures are used for congressional redistricting in states, Latino voters should not be ""written off and treated as disposable constituents,"" she added. The census data show that while the white population increased by 2.2 million to 196.8 million, its share of the total population dropped to 64% from 69%, officials said. The Asian population also grew 43%, increasing from 10.2 million in 2000 to 14.7 million in 2010, officials said. Asians now account for about 5% of the nation's population. The African-American population, which grew by about 4.3 million, is now about 40 million, or 12.6% of the population, a slight increase over 12.3% in 2000, officials said. Persons reporting ""some other race"" grew by 3.7 million, to 19 million, or 5.5% of the nation, figures show. The vast majority of Americans, 97%, reported only one race, with whites as the largest group, accounting for about seven out of 10 Americans. The remaining 3% of the population reported multiple races, and almost all of them listed exactly two races. White and black was the leading biracial combination, figures show. ""The face of the country is changing,"" said Jeffrey Passel, demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center. Demographic data had already been released for all states except New York and Maine and for the District of Columbia. In fast-growing states where whites and blacks dominated past growth, Hispanics are now the greatest growth engine, Frey said. The significance of the numbers to the United States is more than just an increase of an ethnicity. Research shows that along with the changing demographics, the country has become more diverse in other ways, Passel said. For instance, there is a substantial mixing of the American population through interracial marriage, he said. Another change is the concentration of the growing populations. Previously, the Hispanic population was concentrated in eight or nine states; it is now spread throughout the country, Passel said. Meanwhile, most of the data released so far show decreases in the population of white children, Frey said. Minorities will have a greater presence among future generations, he said. For example, in Nevada, 61% of children are minorities, compared with 41% of adults. In border states like Texas, demographers say, Hispanic populations are expected to surpass non-Hispanic populations within the next decade. ""Without question, we are becoming a Hispanic state,"" said Texas state demographer Lloyd Potter. ""I live in San Antonio, and there you see Spanish advertisements, television shows and newspapers everywhere,"" he said. In cities and towns across the region, there are Spanish-speaking restaurants, retailers and annual festivals. ""It's helpful to be able to speak a little Spanish if you're non-Hispanic,"" Potter said. ""My neighbors don't really speak much English. While my Spanish isn't great, at least we can interact and be neighbors."" But while the labor force may absorb Spanish-only employees, an emerging debate among policy makers asks whether their children face additional challenges in English-speaking schools. ""Education attainment is the single best determinant for a whole variety of social outcomes,"" said Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington. Analysts speculate that while population levels swell, comparable growth in education levels may take some time. ""In New York City, Italians once had a much higher high school dropout rate,"" Camarota said, noting an Italian immigration flux in the United States that spanned the years of 1890 to 1920. ""It took them 60 to 70 years to lower those levels and close the socioeconomic gap."" CNN's Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","The Hispanic population is now 50.5 million, or 16% of the country .

"(CNN) -- A stolen war memorial that was at the center of a prominent legal battle over the display of religious symbols on public land was found this week tied to a fence post near San Francisco. Federal officials said on Thursday the Mojave Cross, removed by vandals from its lonely California desert perch two years ago, was located 500 miles away in Half Moon Bay. ""It was not easy to pick out identifying features to examine, but they are now confirming that it is in fact the Mojave Cross,"" Linda Slater, a spokeswoman with the Mojave National Preserve, said. The Latin cross was first erected on national parkland in 1934 to honor war dead and has been rebuilt several times over the years. Easter services are held annually at the site. A federal judge in 2001 ordered the six-foot metal cross covered with plywood in response to a lawsuit claiming the symbol violated federal law prohibiting government preference for a particular religion. Frank Buono, a former Park Service employee, said in his suit the cross amounted to government endorsement of the Christian faith. An appeals court agreed, but the Supreme Court ruled in 2010 it did not violate church-state separation and left it to lower courts to decide the circumstances for its display. After months of subsequent litigation, the National Park Service conveyed a one-acre piece of federal land where the cross stood to the California Veterans of Foreign Wars. The cross received congressional recognition a decade ago -- shortly after the initial lawsuits were filed -- and its now known as the White Cross World War I Memorial. A replacement cross will be erected Sunday in a special rededication ceremony near the Mojave National Preserve. The San Mateo County Sheriff's Department was contacted this week by someone saying the stolen cross was tied to a fence post in Half Moon Bay. A note tied on it said authorities should be contacted. Henry Sandoz, a local man who had built and erected the cross on Sunrise Rock in the park, was notified by rangers to help identify it. The rangers and Sandoz finally agreed that the cross found in San Mateo County was definitely the same one stolen in 2010, Slater said. The National Park Service plans to return it to him. The cross itself was embedded in rock held in place by concrete. Whoever removed the original would have had to climb up the steep outcropping, maneuvering around rattlesnakes that hide in the crevices. There have been no arrests or any indication who stole the original cross and how it would up in the San Francisco Bay area.","Mojave Cross was stolen from California desert in 2010 .

"Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) -- It is a very different year - and very different mood -- as Democrats gather for their convention. But there is one carryover from 2008: To win the White House, Barack Obama will once again have to make history. Four years ago, it was a groundbreaking victory for the first African-American to win the presidency. Now, to win four more years, it is a less glamorous but still significant barrier in his way: only Franklin Roosevelt was re-elected with unemployment this high. But while the historic statistical models would suggest defeat looms in November, the president arrives in Charlotte with several key advantages in the race, and with an easier path to 270 Electoral College votes and victory than his Republican rival. Among the advantages: . • Incumbency: Yes there are downsides to this, but the stage and powers of the presidency are on the whole an advantage, especially in a close, competitive race. • More room for error: Mitt Romney needs to win Florida and Ohio, and at least two of these three -- Virginia, North Carolina and Wisconsin -- to have a realistic shot at 270. Obama, on the other hand, enters his convention with several paths to cobble 270 together. Zelizer: What Democrats need to do in Charlotte . • Demographics: As long as the GOP has a crisis with Latino voters, there is a built-in Democratic edge in several key states. New Mexico, not long ago a presidential swing state, is barely mentioned as a potential GOP target. And Nevada is a competitive tossup despite the highest unemployment rate among the states and a punishing housing crisis. Yet the challenges are obvious. While his path to 270 has more room for error, it is very different from the lopsided Democratic advantage in 2008. Then-Sen. Obama won three states that hadn't voted Democratic for president in more than a generation -- Indiana, North Carolina and Virginia. His campaign already concedes Indiana is an almost-certain red state this year, and North Carolina and Virginia are tossups. So are Wisconsin, Iowa, Nevada and Colorado -- all states where the president's margin was fairly comfortable four years ago. Poll: Romney 47%, Obama 43% in North Carolina . The economy is of course the driving force behind the very different 2012 map and mood. The unemployment rate in February 2009 -- Obama's first full month is office -- was 8.3%. Last month, it was 8.3%. To the Romney campaign, that is proof the president's economic policies have failed. The Obama team, in turn, notes that unemployment hit 10% in October 2009, and argues that the president's policies are, albeit slowly, helping pull the economy out of a deep recession he inherited. Obama says fatherhood trumps schmoozing . In any event, the jobless numbers and other economic data make it all but impossible for the president to make the case Americans are better off today than they were four years ago. So his convention priority is to make the case that his approach is the better, fairer path to sustained recovery. The primary target: independents and conservative Democrats in battleground states. ""The thing I most love about them is how they discovered the middle class at their convention,"" Vice President Joe Biden mockingly told a crowd Sunday in Green Bay, Wisconsin -- pushing the fairness argument. ""Wasn't that amazing? All of a sudden their heart was bleeding for the middle class."" Where have all the protesters gone? Just as critical, if not more so, is the Obama tactical imperative of using the convention to re-energize his 2008 base. ""Don't boo - vote,"" was the president's weekend appeal to a Colorado college audience, and it is a snapshot of the 2012 nuts-and-bolts approach of a campaign team that understands it cannot rely on the dynamics that motivated 2008 Obama voters. To be sure, he continues to enjoy a huge edge among African-Americans, Latinos and younger voters. But if Romney can make even marginal gains among those groups, or turnout dips even slightly, or both, it could make the difference in several key battlegrounds. The convention state of North Carolina is a test case of Obama 2012 vs. Obama 2008 in the ground game. Also noteworthy in Charlotte, though likely somewhat less obvious than it was in Tampa, will be the 2016 factor. Joe and Jill Biden have busy Charlotte schedules, and the vice president of course has a coveted speaking slot. Biden is 69, meaning he would be 73 at the 2016 convention, but he has not ruled out a third try for his party's presidential nomination. Ryan set to campaign on 'are you better off' question . Hillary Clinton will have no Charlotte role -- inappropriate, she says, for a secretary of state. But as much as she says she is done with politics when this first Obama term ends, the convention has no shortage of Clinton loyalists, including her husband, the former president. From there, as in Tampa, the focus will be on ambitious next-generation prospects, among them Govs. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, Deval Patrick of Massachusetts and, for the first time in years, perhaps a Cuomo -- New York's governor, Andrew. To look at a map searching for Democrats of the future though, is to be reminded of a painful truth for the party gathering in Charlotte: President Obama is their undisputed leader, but the Obama presidency has been a time of deep Democratic decline. When Obama took office Democrats held: . • 56 Senate seats. It is 51 now (plus two independents who align mostly with the Democrats). • 257 seats in the House of Representatives. It is 190 now (there are also three vacancies for seats last held by Democrats). • 29 of the 50 governorships. It is 20 now. • 4,073 state legislative seats. It is 3,319 now.","No incumbent has ever been re-elected with unemployment this high .

"(CNN) -- Last week, presidential candidate Mitt Romney said that if he were elected president, he would stop funding the Public Broadcasting System. As the stewards of the Reading Rainbow brand, as parents, as products of families that relied on PBS to provide educational support, we can't stay silent about this. It is an attack not just on PBS, but on America's children. LeVar Burton has spent most of his life as an education advocate, hosting PBS's ""Reading Rainbow"" for 26 years, testifying before Congress on the importance of education and of public broadcasting, and as a national speaker, promoting literacy. And Mark Wolfe, who was practically raised in Julia Child's TV kitchen (his parents managed publicity for local PBS stations), grew up with Mr. Rogers as a family friend. Mr. Rogers, who so eloquently defended PBS against an earlier threat to its funding, can no longer speak out, but we can. Opinion: Will Big Bird be downsized? How many of our children learned letters from Bert and Ernie before they ever went to preschool? How many could count because of The Count? How many of our new scientists were introduced to their future profession by Bill Nye? And how many of you discovered a love of books through ""Reading Rainbow""? PBS offers kids television shows that are free -- and especially free of hard-sell commercials and corporate points of view. PBS educates our children. Nearly every day LeVar is approached by parents, teachers and adults who grew up watching PBS, telling him how much the programs they watched benefited them and their students. Studies show that PBS has been responsible for improvements in early, elementary, middle and even high school education. PBS represents 0.00012% of our nation's budget. And while this resource benefits kids across all economic circumstances, it has even greater impact on the disadvantaged. Yet it has been made a political issue. After Romney's attack, the CEO of PBS, Paula Kerger, commented that ""with the enormous problems facing our country, the fact that we are the focus is just unbelievable to me. We're America's biggest classroom. We touch children across the country in every home. Whether you have books in your home or computer or not, almost everyone has a television set."" Mitt Romney said, in last week's debate: ""I'm going to stop the subsidy to PBS. ... I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don't pass it: Is the program so critical it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, I'll get rid of it."" Opinion: Defund public broadcasting and set it free . This is telling in that while he suggests unspecified litmus tests for funding, he begins by saying PBS has already failed. We wonder what defines ""critical"" to Mr. Romney. Free educational tools perhaps? PBS is a leading video resource for high schools, offering older kids exceptional age-appropriate programming, such as ""NOVA"" and Ken Burns historical documentaries; it supplies 20,000 digital tools, such as in-depth teacher lesson plans, for students from pre-kindergarten to 12th grade; half a million teachers rely on the PBS educational resource ""Learning Media."" What most people don't realize is that if federal funding for PBS were cut, much of the loss would be on the local level. The vast majority of taxpayer funds for PBS ($1.35 per person per year) goes to local stations, many of which serve rural areas, where losing funding would mean stations going dark. We remind Mr. Romney that when small businesses go out of business, not only are their products no longer available to the public, people lose their jobs. Where is the gain in saving the $1.35 a year? We see only loss. Big Bird stays up to pay a visit to 'SNL' Well? We as a nation must decide where our priorities are. Is education a priority? Are our children our priority? Are we going to support those priorities or just pay lip service to them? If these are our critical priorities, then we must support efforts like PBS and we must speak out when our children are used as political tools. What Mitt Romney chooses to ignore or cannot see is that PBS represents the delivery on America's promise to itself: a promise to provide all children, rich or poor, black or white, with quality educational opportunities. This is an ongoing struggle. Schools are underfunded. Teachers are undervalued. And now PBS is under attack by a candidate who wants to lead our country . Make your own decision about how you feel about Romney's statements against PBS, and act. But you don't have to take our word for it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LeVar Burton and Mark Wolfe.","LeVar Burton, Mark Wolfe: Romney has said he would defund PBS. Time to speak up .
They say PBS helps build literacy, particularly in disadvantaged kids .
They say from Bert and Ernie to ""Reading Rainbow"" to NOVA, PBS provides educational tools .
Writers: Funding cuts would hurt local stations, jobs; this shows misplaced priorities ."
"(CNN) -- A DNA investigation following the discovery of 11 bodies in a Cleveland home has linked a second man to serial killings in the area, prosecutors announced Tuesday. ""This is wild stuff,"" said Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Bill Mason. ""One serial killer leads us to another one."" After the bodies were found at the home of Anthony Sowell in 2009, Cleveland's Cold Case Unit launched a DNA investigation into victims found within a 3-mile radius of the property. The unit matched two cases to felon Joseph Harwell, who is currently serving time on a separate murder charge, Mason said. Both the victims allegedly tied to Harwell, 27-year-old Mary Thomas and 33-year-old Tondilear Harge, were found raped and fatally strangled, seven years apart from one another. Thomas was three to four months pregnant at the time of the attack, a release by the Cuyahoga County Prosecutors Office says. Harwell is indicted on 14 counts, including charges of aggravated murder, rape, and kidnapping, according to the prosecutors office. Believing there could be more victims related to the ones found in the Sowell home, ""we kind of drew a circle around his residence,"" Mason said. ""There are missing pieces. I don't believe that everybody (Sowell) killed, he put in his house,"" Mason said. ""There's a lot of missing girls that would fit that description."" Harwell is currently serving time for the 1997 murder of 29-year-old Teresa Vinson of Columbus. He is up for parole next year but with Tuesday's additional indictments could now face the death penalty, according to Mason. ""He was kind of a little stunned by it, to say the least,"" Mason said on Harwell's reaction to his DNA linkage to the two victims. ""... He just said I want a lawyer."" Harwell was also convicted of felonious assault in 1989 for attempted strangulation of a 31-year-old woman in east Cleveland and convicted of aggravated robbery in 1979. Mason's office accuses Harwell of murdering Thomas in 1989 and murdering Harge in 1996, according to a statement. Sowell, indicted on 85 counts including aggravated murder, rape and kidnapping, is currently awaiting trial. He has pled not guilty.","Cold Case Unit ""kind of drew a circle"" around one serial killer's home .

"URUMQI, China (CNN) -- Chinese police had detained at least 1,434 people by Tuesday morning following weekend demonstrations by ethnic Uyghur residents in Xinjiang province, Xinhua reported, citing government officials, as protests spread to more cities. Chinese riot police patrol a street in Urumqi in Xinjiang province on July 6. Streets had reverted to calm and curfews were in force in major districts of Urumqi as the death toll mounted from rioting. Police halted people who had gathered in nearby Yili Kazak Prefecture and Aksu City and dispersed more than 200 people who had tried to gather in nearby Kashgar at the Id Kah Mosque, the largest mosque in China, the news agency said. Along the road into Kashgar from the airport, many areas were deserted; residents said police had set up blockades in some areas and were rerouting traffic. The regional public security department put the toll from riots at 156 deaths and more than 800 injuries, according to Xinhua, the state-run news agency.  Watch more on violence in Xinjiang » . That was an increase from the 140 deaths reported at noon Monday. ""Among the 16 newly reported dead, some died in hospitals and others were recovered from street corners, the police said,"" according to Xinhua. With a massive presence of soldiers and anti-riot squads, the government said Tuesday, the unrest in this capital of China's far-west Xinjiang region had been brought under control.  See a map of Xinjiang » . In a rare public display of dissatisfaction, thousands of Uyghurs -- many of whom feel they are treated as second-class citizens and complain of being discriminated against by the majority Han Chinese -- took to the streets Sunday chanting and screaming, which prompted a police lockdown of the city. ""Traffic control was partially lifted Monday morning in parts of Urumqi ... but tension still exists in the city,"" Xinhua said. ""Debris has been cleared from the roads and normal traffic has resumed. Workers are still pulling away damaged vehicles from the worst-affected roads in the city.""  Watch victims describe the riots in Urumqi » . Most businesses in the area where the violence took place remained closed Monday, Xinhua said. iReport.com: Are you there? Share photos, video, commentary . State-run media reported that protesters attacked passersby, burned public buses and blocked traffic Sunday. The report did not say how many people took part in the protest or what their grievances were. But a witness in Urumqi told CNN that soon after the protest started about 5 p.m., hundreds of protesters ""grew into easily over 1,000 -- men, women and children, all ethnic Uyghurs -- screaming and chanting."" Police arrived quickly and tried to control the swelling crowd by erecting barriers in the street, but ""people pushed them over,"" the witness said. ""They were throwing rocks at passing cars and buses."" As the violence escalated, hundreds of riot police arrived, the witness said. ""They used tear gas and fire hoses to disperse the crowd. I saw fire trucks, ambulances, armed personnel carriers and what looked like tanks. I heard random gunshots."" Late Sunday, the witness said, Urumqi was in a lockdown, with hundreds of People's Liberation Army soldiers in the streets. He reported seeing riot police chasing protesters into alleys and rounding up many of them. The witness speculated that the protest, which took place in the predominantly Uyghur-populated Bazaar district, may have been a reaction to racial violence in southern China. The violence reportedly happened at a toy factory in Guangdong province, where many migrants, including Uyghurs, have moved in search of work. A massive brawl reportedly broke out between workers of Uyghur and Han nationalities. Two Uyghurs reportedly died. Xinjiang is home to many Uyghurs. China's constitution guarantees ethnic minorities equal rights and limited autonomy. However, ethnic tensions run deep. Minority groups such as the Uyghurs complain that they are subjected to discrimination by the majority Han nationality. The World Uyghur Congress, a dissident Uyghur group based in Munich, Germany, condemned the crackdown on what it described in a written statement as Sunday's ""peaceful protest"" by Uyghurs. ""The Chinese authorities should acknowledge that the peaceful protest was sparked by the unlawful mob beating and killing of Uyghur workers at a Guangdong toy factory more than a week ago,"" it said. ""The authorities should also acknowledge that their failure to take any meaningful action to punish the Chinese mob for the brutal murder of Uyghurs is the real cause of this protest."" It accused Chinese authorities of having ""used tear gas, automatic rifles and armored vehicles to disperse the Uyghur protesters. During the crackdown, some were shot to death, and some were beaten to death by Chinese police. Some demonstrators were even crushed by armored vehicles near Xinjiang University, according to eyewitnesses."" The government in Xinjiang blamed ""foreign forces"" for Sunday's rioting. ""The violence is premeditated, organized violent crime,"" said Nur Bekri, chairman of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, the equivalent of a governor. ""It was instigated and directed from abroad and carried out by outlaws in the country."" Bekri accused the World Uyghur Congress of spreading rumors and inciting anger that led to the rioting, in a speech carried by Xinjiang television. The World Uyghur Congress denied the charge. It is led by Rebuya Kadeer, a businesswoman of Uyghur ethnicity who was detained in 1999 and accused of harming China's national security. She was freed on bail in 2005 and was allowed to leave for the United States for medical care. Bekri accused Kadeer of instigating the unrest via the Internet and said the fight at the Guangdong toy factory was exploited to incite ethnic strife. ""We should bear in mind that stability is to the greatest interest of all people in China, including the 21 million-plus people from all ethnic groups in Xinjiang,"" he said.","NEW: Chinese police detain at least 1,434 suspects .

"(CNN) -- Clad in his trademark black overcoat Jose Mourinho famously sprinted down Old Trafford's touchline eight years ago to celebrate Porto's last-gasp equalizer which knocked Manchester United out of the European Champions League. And if Mourinho gets his way the Real Madrid coach will be spending much more time on the touchline -- the Portuguese coach wants football's authorities to introduce a timeout system. Widely employed in sports such as American football, basketball and ice hockey, timeouts allow a coach to talk directly to their players when a game is stopped. At present soccer coaches are only allowed to give tactical advice to their players at half time. ""It's something that I think football could improve a little bit,"" Mourinho, who celebrated Real's recent win over Manchester City in the Champions League by sliding on to his knees on the Bernabeu turf, told CNN in an exclusive interview. ""It would be to allow during a match to find a way to allow the coach to have a relation with the players."" Real's coach suggested that the timeout should come midway through the first half. ""You could ask for a minute like the American sports have. It probably would be a solution, or give us some more freedom to walk around the touchline."" Read: Old money Real Madrid hold off nouveau riche Man City . Mourinho's career at Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real has been characterized by meticulous planning and his use of early double or triple substitutions to change the course of a game. But he revealed he was flexible in his approach to the way he delivered his half-time team talks. ""Sometimes, it's emotionally. Sometimes, it's spontaneous. Sometimes, you don't think and sometimes, you don't have time to think,"" said Mourinho. ""But many other times, of course, I prepare myself. ""Even when I'm in the match, the last 10 minutes of the first half, more than analyzing the game, I'm preparing myself for half-time because that's when I can have an impact on the players. ""I can help the players to improve and to win a match, so I try to be an observer and I try to analyze the game during the first 30-35 minutes of the first half and the last 10 minutes, I am preparing myself for my direct contact with the players."" The Real coach added: ""Players are incredible artists and during the match, sometimes they express themselves in a way where they're not even thinking about it. They do things where they don't think. And I think with coaches, it can happen the same."" However, Mourinho admitted that his advice was not always heeded by his players. Notably when he was Inter Milan coach and devoted the majority of a half-time team talk pleading with Italian forward Mario Balotelli to take care and not get sent off in a Champions League game against Rubin Kazan. But Mourinho's words of wisdom fell on deaf ears and almost immediately after the restart the enigmatic Balotelli picked up a red card. ""I could write a book of 200 pages of my two years at Inter with Mario, but the book would be not a drama, the book would be a comedy because he's a funny, he's a funny kid,"" said Mourinho. Read: Ronaldo hat-trick leaves Real Madrid in command of Group of Death . More seriously, Mourinho suggested Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini might be the only coach who could persuade Balotelli, who scored a late equalizer for City in the 1-1 Champions League draw with Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday, to maximize his formidable talent. ""Mancini was his first coach as a professional, so before me,"" said Mourinho. ""So for sure the same feeling I have, Mancini has probably even more than Mario. ""You know, Mario was 18 with Mancini at Inter, was 20 with me. Now, he should be 22, so the natural tendency is that he grows up and becomes the player that the talent he has. ""I've no contact with Mario in this moment, but I hope so. I hope so, and Roberto knows him well, speaks the same language, knows him since he was a kid, so if he doesn't do it with Roberto, it will be difficult to do with another one, but I hope so because he's a talent.""","Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho calls for introduction of U.S style timeouts .

"New York (CNN) -- Police found what appears to be a human skull Monday on the outskirts of a bird sanctuary in Long Island, New York, a county police officer said, potentially the ninth set of remains discovered in the probe of a suspected serial killer. Lt. Kevin Smith of the Nassau County Police Department said the skull was found around 3:30 p.m. in Oyster Bay. About four hours earlier, a New York state police officer and his cadaver dog spotted another set of remains about a mile and a half away, and authorities worked to determine whether those remains are human. These discoveries come on the first day that authorities probing the deaths of several young women searched for evidence in and around Nassau County. Since December, eight sets of human remains have been found in Suffolk County, just to the east of Nassau County and roughly five miles from the sites of Monday's discoveries. ""It's just been very startling, all of it has been,"" Smith told reporters Monday. ""It's just amazing that we're finding these things. Obviously, we have a lot of work to do."" Authorities are working on the presumption that a single person is responsible for the women's killings. The five victims who have been identified thus far all advertised prostitution services on websites such as Craigslist, police have said. ""Collectively, we want to bring to justice this animal who has obviously taken the lives of a number of people,"" said Nassau County Executive Ed Mangano on Monday. Authorities would not describe what type of remains were found on Monday morning, and Smith did not detail the condition of the skull found in the afternoon. But police have said that the bodies discovered earlier were in various stages of decomposition, including at least one that could have been there for as long as two years, according to Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer. Watch the sister of a missing woman tell her story . The remains have included four female bodies found in December stuffed in bushes along a quarter-mile strip of beachfront property. Last week, three bodies were uncovered within a few miles of each other, fueling speculation that they could be the work of a serial killer. A woman's body was also found March 29 off Ocean Parkway, west of Cedar Beach. The missing woman who prompted authorities to initiate the search -- 24-year-old Shannan Gilbert -- has not yet been identified. K-9 units and dive teams had been added to the search operation in an effort to locate Gilbert, who was last seen alive in May in the Gilgo Beach area. Search for missing women expands . Gilbert's sisters said Shannan was an escort who was visiting a client. They said she ran from the man's house and called 911, claiming that someone was trying to hurt her. Several neighbors also called 911, witnesses say. Police came more than 30 minutes later, but by then Gilbert was gone and has never been heard from again. ""You want to believe everything was OK with her,"" Sherre Gilbert said. ""But at the same time, so much time has passed it's impossible to really think that she is still alive."" Sherre Gilbert said even if her sister is never found, the search has led to one positive outcome: the discovery of the other women's bodies.

"(CNN) -- It might be Oz, Kansas or simply somewhere over the rainbow. While the destination may not be known, there's no doubt the blue gingham dress wore by Judy Garland, as Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" has a new home. The price was not the broom of the Wicked Witch of the West, as the Wizard of Oz demanded from Dorothy to send her back home to Auntie Em in the classic 1939 movie. Rather, someone this weekend paid $480,000 for Dorothy's dress, according to Julien's Auctions. The costume was one of several pieces of Hollywood history up for sale from Julien's auction house in Beverly Hills, California. Two of the auction's biggest ticket items were traced to late actress and sex symbol Marilyn Monroe. A purple skirt worn in Canada by Monroe, as she was filming ""River of No Return,"" sold for $50,000, while a gold blouse and matching Capri pants fetched $43,750. Buyers of the items were not identified. Other signature clothing auctioned off included a Steve McQueen racing jacket for $50,000, a dress Julie Andrews (as Maria) wore in ""The Sound of Music"" for $38,400, and a black gown worn by Jaclyn Smith of ""Charlie's Angels"" fame for $15,000. The ""Wizard of Oz"" was responsible for another big seller during the two-day event. One auction winner shelled out $33,750 for a collection of studio and publicity images tied to the MGM film. It remains to be seen if Dorothy's dress will be reunited with her ruby slippers. The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures -- with the help of ""angel donors"" including actor Leonardo DiCaprio -- acquired one of four pairs of the iconic red shoes last February. That set are called the ""Witch's Shoes,"" because they were likely seen on the Wicked Witch of the East when Dorothy's house fell on her in the film, according to the Academy. They're also likely the pair Dorothy, as played by Garland, had on in close-ups, such as in the memorable scene when she clicks the heels of the red shoes three times to head home.

"(CNN) -- The dieting world screams with contradictory advice: Carbs are evil; carbs are good for you. ""Good fat"" is healthy; ""good fat"" has tons of calories. Diets targeted at carbohydrates, proteins or fats result in similiar results, as long as calorie intake was reduced. Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center put four popular diets -- high carb, high fat, low-fat and high protein -- to the test to see which of the regimens resulted in more weight-loss success. After two years of monitoring the participants, ""all the diets were winners,"" said study co-author Dr. Frank Sacks, a professor of cardiovascular disease prevention at the Harvard School of Public Health. ""All produced weight loss and improvements in lipids, reduction in insulin. ""The key really is that it's calories. It's not the content of fat or carbohydrates, it's just calories,"" said Sacks. The findings are published in the latest edition of the New England Journal of Medicine. For the study, 811 overweight adults in Boston, Massachusetts, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were assigned to one of four diets. A quarter went on a carbohydrate-heavy diet, some on high-fat, others on low-fat and the remaining on high-protein diet. The four diets were not based on popular diets, Sacks said. Regardless of diet, most participants had dramatic weight loss after six months, losing an average of 13 pounds. According to Sacks' research, many of the 800-plus participants regained weight after a year, but about 80 percent of them lost at least eight pounds after two years. And 15 percent of the participants lost at least 10 percent of their body weight. The study, funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health, showed little difference in users' satiety, hunger or satisfaction with their diets. Participants could attend individual sessions where dieticians educated them  and group sessions where they discussed their experiences with one another. Those who had better attendance in the sessions had stronger weight-loss results. ""These findings together point to behavioral factors rather than macronutrient metabolism as the main influences on weight loss,"" according to the study. Macronutrients are the three main nutrients the body uses in relatively large amounts: proteins, carbohydrates and fats.  Watch the comparisons among four diets. » . ""No one of those diets are necessarily better than any other diet,"" Sacks said. In an accompanying editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, Martijin B. Katan wrote the researchers' hypothesis is ""plausible,"" but said the ""differences in macronutrient intake were too small."" There was an underlying similarity between the four diets. On average, the overweight participants had a 750-calorie reduction per day.  An average-sized male who consumed 2,800 calories a day was prescribed just over 2,000 calories and a woman who ate 2000 calories a day was prescribed 1,250 calories. All diets were compatible with American Heart Association guidelines, Sack said. The study did not give the participants food. For the first 10 days, participants received menus, then were assigned to create their own using the healthy food options. Depending on their prescribed diet, participants ate a wide range of carbohydrates, fat and protein, derived from healthy foods, such as olive oil, pasta and nut butter. From these results, Sacks recommends going with ""the diet you feel most comfortable that is healthy, that appeals to you in terms of what foods are in it, that isn't a drastic crash diet. Whatever allows you to keep the calories down and not feel really deprived."" Calorie restriction can be done without feeling deprived, said Dr. Luigi Fontana, an associate professor of medicine at the Washington University who studies the effects of calorie restriction on longevity. But he warns against just halving a person's current diet. Share your weight-loss success story with iReport.com. ""A lot of people think of calorie restriction like eating half a hamburger, half a pack of French fries -- that you can obtain by reducing in half your portions,"" Fontana said. ""That's calorie restriction with malnutrition."" Dr. Melina Jampolis, the diet and fitness expert for CNNhealth warned against drastic measures like completely focusing on one macronutrient. ""People want to be extreme,"" she said. ""You say cut back on sugar, they cut it completely. The take-home would be that there is no markedly superior diet. If there was, people wouldn't stick with it anyway."" Cindy Moore, the director of nutrition therapy at Cleveland Clinic and a registered dietician agreed. ""People gravitate to the latest fads or trends, because they may have known someone who was successful in losing weight. That friend may have been in that early grace period of losing weight. The other thing is people think they need that magic bullet."" But a significant change in eating habits -- like cutting out an entire nutrient group like carbohydrates, proteins or fats, often can't be sustained. Weight loss tends to be dramatic during the first few months. Brenda Driver, of Springfield, Missouri, was not involved in the study but says she lost 10 pounds in 10 days on the Atkins diet by eschewing all carbohydrates. The 26-year-old and her fiance said they were ""not looking at a crash diet, but want to jump start weight loss."" The former vegetarians began eating meat again because of the high protein demands of the diet. Driver said she's aware the Atkins diet is not an ideal long-term plan. Six years ago, she tried the diet for seven months and lost 45 pounds. She finally quit the diet because of her chocolate cravings. This month, Driver and her fiance decided to give the Atkins another try. ""I want to rebel against the whole, 'you're-engaged-now-you-have-to-lose-weight,' "" she said. But it would be nice to look slimmer in those wedding photos, she said. ""I'm approaching it as a temporary thing. Vegetarianism is where I want to be the rest of my life."" Moore said the basics of losing weight boil down to this: Limit the calories consumed so a person is taking in less than the body needs or increase activity to burn more energy. The problem, she said is that, ""People get discouraged if weight loss is really, really slow.""","Researchers test four diets for weight-loss effectiveness .

"(CNN) -- The affair that brought an end to David Petraeus' tenure as CIA director came to light during an FBI investigation into a complaint that his biographer Paula Broadwell was sending harassing e-mails to another woman close to him, a U.S. official said Saturday. During the investigation, other communications surfaced between Petraeus and Broadwell, a married mother of two, according to the official. The official did not identify the woman who made the initial complaint and did not know the nature of her relationship with Petraeus. The FBI interviewed Petraeus in the course of its inquiry, said the official, who stressed that the CIA director was never the target of the investigation and his communications were never compromised. The official did not know whether Broadwell was interviewed. The official did not have an exact timeframe for the investigation and could not say if it is still ongoing. CNN has not been able to reach Broadwell for comment. The Obama administration first learned of the affair in a phone call from the FBI to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper at 5 p.m. on election night, according to a senior U.S. intelligence official. On Saturday, questions arose about why congressional leaders were not informed of the investigation immediately. According to a congressional aide familiar with the matter, the House and Senate intelligence committees weren't informed that there was an FBI investigation into the situation until Friday. ""The committees are required to be kept informed of significant intelligence activities,"" the aide said Saturday. ""If there was an official investigation that was looking, at least in part, at information that was compromising the CIA director, then I think there's a solid argument to say that the committee leadership should have been notified to at least some level of detail."" The resignation also comes days before Petraeus was slated to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee about the September 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. The attack, in which four Americans were killed, became a point of contention during the presidential campaign. Some have even suggested that the timing of Petraeus' stepping down is suspect, given the expected grilling in Congress. Acting CIA Director Michael Morell will testify instead. Politicians react to the resignation . ""Director Petraeus' frank and forthright letter of resignation stands on its own,"" said a senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic. ""Any suggestion that his departure has anything to do with criticism about Benghazi is completely baseless."" Homeland Security Committee Chairman Rep. Peter King, R-New York, who is also a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, insisted that Petraeus should not back out of plans to testify. King, a vocal critic of the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack, said on CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" that Petraeus is ""an absolutely essential witness, maybe more than anybody else."" ""David Petraeus' testifying has nothing to do with whether or not he's still the CIA director, and I don't see how the CIA can say he's not going to testify,"" King said. ""I think his testimony is certainly valuable, it's certainly necessary,"" King continued. ""He was at the center of this, and he has answers that only he has."" If Petraeus does not testify as originally scheduled on Thursday, King said, ""It should be very soon after that."" How Petraeus changed the U.S. military . Broadwell spent a year with Petraeus in Afghanistan interviewing him for the book she co-wrote, ""All In: The Education of General David Petraeus."" Petraeus' departure Friday appeared to be an abrupt end to a spectacularly successful career in public service. ""After being married for over 37 years, I showed extremely poor judgment by engaging in an extramarital affair. Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours,"" Petraeus said in a letter to colleagues, explaining his decision to step down. ""Teddy Roosevelt once observed that life's greatest gift is the opportunity to work hard at work worth doing. I will always treasure my opportunity to have done that with you and I will always regret the circumstances that brought that work with you to an end,"" he said. Read letter Petraeus sent to colleagues . Petraeus, 60, had a distinguished 37-year career in the military before joining the CIA, helping turn the tide against insurgents while commanding forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Earning praise from both sides of the political aisle, the retired four-star general took the helm of the CIA in September 2011. Petraeus met with Obama on Thursday to offer his resignation and explain the circumstances behind it, according to a senior administration official. The president accepted Petraeus' resignation during a phone call Friday, the official said. ""By any measure, he was one of the outstanding general officers of his generation, helping our military adapt to new challenges and leading our men and women in uniform through a remarkable period of service in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he helped our nation put those wars on a path to a responsible end,"" Obama said in a statement. ""As director of the Central Intelligence Agency, he has continued to serve with characteristic intellectual rigor, dedication and patriotism."" Petraeus assumed command of the NATO International Security Assistance Force and U.S. Forces Afghanistan in July 2010, after serving for more than 20 months as commander of U.S. Central Command. He previously commanded multinational forces in Iraq, leading the so-called surge. The general literally wrote the book on counterinsurgency techniques by overseeing development of the Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Manual. Before his nomination as CIA director, Petraeus was considered the nation's most well-known and popular military leader since Colin Powell. Petraeus and his wife, Holly, live in Virginia. They have two grown children. CNN's Carol Cratty, Terry Frieden, Suzanne Kelly and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","A probe into harassing e-mails uncovered communications between Petraeus and his biographer .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The scar has faded over his left eye, but the fireworks injury that Tony Wittmann suffered when he was 17 taught him a lesson that he hasn't forgotten. Sparklers burn at temperatures up to 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit (about 1,100 Celsius). ""Teenagers being teenagers, we were shooting bottle rockets at each other from about 200 yards away,"" he remembers. ""One hit above my eye and stuck in my forehead and exploded."" Emergency room doctors were able to stitch up the torn the tissue around his eye, but Wittmann was pretty shaken up. ""I thought at first, 'I'm 17 and I'm blinded for life.' Once I calmed down, I realized I was OK, but it took all the fun out of the day."" Wittmann, now a 42-year-old firefighter and paramedic in Shawnee, Oklahoma, uses the story to explain the dangers of fireworks to his young sons. ""I try to tell them to learn from my mistake."" Every year at this time, he and his colleagues expect to be sent on a fireworks emergency call. ""Either a roof will be set on fire or someone will get burned,"" he said. ""I don't think you'll ever get an injury-free season."" Health Minute: Watch more the dangers of fireworks » . Unfortunately, that's true not just in Oklahoma, but in the rest of the United States as well. The Consumer Product Safety Commission keeps track of injury rates nationwide. Nancy Nord, the commission's acting chairwoman, says fireworks injuries are common. ""Over 9,000 people are injured each year because of fireworks, on average seven people die,"" she said. The agency estimates that half the injuries occur among children. ""Little kids love sparklers,"" Nord says. ""But sparklers burn at temperatures up to 2,000 degrees [Fahrenheit], and sparklers are the biggest cause of injury for children under 5."" Burns, lacerations and eye injuries are some of the most common injuries reported. Despite the risks, fireworks are more popular than ever. Bill Weimer, vice president of Phantom Fireworks in Youngstown, Ohio, says this is the busiest time of the year for sales. His company is the operator of the largest chain of fireworks stores in the country and expects to make 95 percent of its yearly sales between Memorial Day and July 4. Three years ago, The Wall Street Journal estimated the six-week revenue to amount to $100 million, a figure Weimer doesn't dispute. But along with increased profits, he contends, ""Fireworks products are safer today than ever before. Most of the injuries unfortunately are due to misuse and abuse."" He strongly encourages people to read the directions and follow the rules. ""This product is wonderful family entertainment, but at the same time, you have to respect the fact that [fireworks] burn to function. ...Parents should watch their kids like hawks."" That's part of the No. 1 safety tip from the Consumer Product Safety Commission: Never allow children to play with or ignite fireworks. The commission also warns users to keep a bucket of water or hose nearby in case of fire, to light fireworks only on a flat surface away from structures and dry leaves, and not to relight fireworks that have not fully functioned. Experts also tell bystanders to be out of range before lighting fireworks. It's a rule Wittmann learned the hard way. ""People don't understand you're dealing with explosives. Most people take them for granted. I know I did."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Just a few years ago, not many people would believe that an independent film director would be put in charge of resurrecting one of the most popular superheroes of all time on the big screen. Yet Marc Webb, best known for ""(500) Days of Summer,"" rebooted ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" on the big screen: a gamble which paid off to the tune of $262 million in the U.S. this past summer. With Jamie Foxx already rumored to play the villain Electro in the 2014 sequel, Webb spoke to CNN about the experience making the hit movie (out on Blu-ray this Friday), and looked ahead to the next installment. (If you haven't seen the movie, be forewarned there are spoilers ahead.) CNN: Now that you've had a little time to the reflect, what surprised you most about the reaction? Webb: We did a big press tour around the world and it was extraordinary to see the level of enthusiasm. In Europe, Asia and everywhere else, it's staggering the pervasiveness of Spider-Man. People reacted well to the Peter (Parker) and Gwen (Stacy) storyline. That was great. More than action, spectacle, superheroes or anything else, what goes on between two people in a room, whether it's anger or love or sometimes both is important. Creating a relatable, emotional space with the characters was crucial. That breakup scene -- Andrew and Emma were really great in that. I have to take my hat off to those actors for that. What was fun was how curious people were about Peter's parents. The long shadow of that mystery was cast over the film. It was really encouraging that that gamble paid off. Even though we didn't quite solve it. CNN: What was your favorite reaction to the film? Webb: In Japan people were really moved by the crane moment. They felt inspired by people coming together. It was nice that it came across. It came across stronger in Japan than Korea. Different parts of the world reacted differently to different things. CNN: What was the most difficult thing to pull off? Webb: You realize how many fans are in that universe. The intensity of the fans was really overwhelming for me, and also inspiring, but also intimidating. You understand their love of the characters and you want to make them happy, but you want to surprise them as well. When I did ""Summer,"" nobody cared. I was desperate for some publicity. With this there was too much publicity and too many websites talking about our movie. You want to make a movie in private to create and experiment but that's not the way of a big franchise. You want to create performances as great as any independent film, it's not about big or small. It's about finding something special. CNN: Would you ideally hope that this becomes a trilogy? Webb: That's too far in the future, but I'm having a great time. I'm having a really great time. CNN: What themes do you want to explore more in the next movie? What should DVD and Blu-Ray viewers look for in preparing for the sequel? Webb: There's a lot more to explore with the parents. The Gwen Stacy saga is going to unfold in an interesting way. CNN: You and Andrew Garfield were confirmed for the sequel. Is Emma Stone likely to return as well? Webb: Emma will be back. Believe you me.","Marc Webb rebooted ""The Amazing Spider-Man""

"(CNN) -- When seven-term Republican Congresswoman Mary Bono Mack conceded to her Democratic challenger Raul Ruiz on Friday, she left two other members of California's GOP House delegation still trailing in tight, unsettled races. As of Saturday, six of seven unresolved House races remain too close to call. In the seventh, two Louisiana Republicans will face off in a December 8 runoff for the 3rd District seat after none of the five candidates got the required 50%. Democrats hold narrow leads in all six of the too-close-to-call races. Should all win, they will have picked up a net gain of eight seats in the House after losing the majority in the chamber and suffering the largest loss of seats since 1948 in the 2010 midterm elections. The New America: What the election teaches us about ourselves . Going into Tuesday's elections, Republicans held a 242-193 majority in the House. Mack took over her seat after her husband Rep. Sonny Bono was killed in a skiing accident in 1998. In a heartfelt statement conceding defeat on Friday night, she congratulated her opponent, an emergency room physician, and thanked her family. ""Today, I called Dr. Ruiz and congratulated him on his impressive victory,"" Mack said. ""Dr. Ruiz will do a fine job if he is guided as well by the people of the congressional district as I was. Please give him the opportunity to succeed. ""It was almost 15 years ago that Sonny died and I became a congresswoman,"" she continued. ""Honestly, nobody worked harder or gave more since then than my two amazing children. They, along with my stepson Chaz, my grandson Sonny and my beloved husband Connie have been so supportive of me this week. I simply couldn't ask for more."" Mack lost by 4% of the vote or more than 7,200 ballots out of the almost 200,000 cast in the race for 36th District. The loss marks the first in her 14-year congressional career. Her husband, former Rep. Connie Mack IV, also lost this week in his bid for U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson's seat in Florida. Mack, who has faced redistricting twice before, once again saw her district's lines redrawn ahead of the 2012 election by a bipartisan commission in California based on 2010 census data. GOP retains grip on House . The California delegation, which has been historically heavily Democrat, will send 36 Democrats and 15 Republicans to Washington as of Saturday, but that number could grow to 38 Democrats if the other two Republicans -- Rep. Dan Lungren and Rep. Brian Bilbray - are defeated. Neither Lungren nor Bilbray have conceded, with provisional and absentee ballots still being recounted in both races. Bilbray spokesman Patrick Howell said the race was ""far from over,"" as additional ballots are processed. Bilbray trails Democrat Scott Peters by 1,334 votes in California's 52nd District. Lungren trails his Democratic challenger Ami Bera by 1,779 votes as of Saturday. The race could drag on for weeks as Sacramento County election officials count the 98,464 vote-by-mail and 31,000 provisional ballots still outstanding. Lungren's district is one of four in Sacramento County. Another potential upset across the country could add yet another tick in the Democrats' tally. Rep. Allen West rode the tea party wave to office in Florida's 18th Congressional District during the 2010 midterm elections, unseating three-term Democrat Rep. Ron Klein with more than an 8-point win. This time around, West faced a tough opponent in Republican-turned-Democrat Patrick Murphy. But refusing to accept defeat after a vote count showed him down by 2,500 votes, West is demanding a full recount. ""There were numerous other disturbing irregularities reported at polls across St. Lucie County, including the doors to polling places being locked when the polls closed, in direct violation of Florida law, thereby preventing the public from witnessing the procedures used to tabulate results,"" a statement released by the West campaign said. The West campaign filed injunctions against the supervisors of elections in Palm Beach County and St. Lucie County to impound voting machines and paper ballots. ""We will continue to fight to ensure every vote is counted properly and fairly, and accordingly will pursue all legal means necessary,"" the statement said. The fiery tea partier isn't guaranteed a recount under Florida election law, which only stipulates an automatic recount in races if the margin of difference between the candidates is a half-percent or less. As close as the race is, it doesn't meet that criterion. The West-Murphy contest is expected to be one of the most expensive congressional races in history, with the national parties and outside groups pouring money into the efforts. West raised significantly more than Murphy -- $17 million vs. $3.6 million. Congressional races set records for spending . Two races in Arizona also remain uncalled. The contest for former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' seat between Democrat Rep. Ron Barber and Republican Martha McSally finds Barber behind by 426 votes. Barber, former district director for Giffords, replaced her in a special election held after she was shot in the head and severely wounded in 2011. The man convicted in the attack outside a supermarket that killed six people received a life prison sentence on Thursday. And in a district across the state, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema is holding onto a 2,715-vote lead over Republican Vernon Parker while provisional and absentee votes are counted. Parker might have Libertarian candidate Powell Gammill to blame if he does not win. Gammill won more than 6% of the vote in Tuesday's election despite urging supporters to stay home rather than vote on Election Day in protest of the political system. The unresolved contest in North Carolina could be the second tightest 2012 congressional race after provisional and absentee ballots are counted for the district that encompasses Wilmington and the area northwest to the Raleigh suburbs. Democratic Rep. Mike McIntyre faced a tough re-election challenge. His district added Johnston County and his hometown of Lumberton was cut from the 7th District this year after redistricting. Once the ballots are counted, either McIntyre or his Republican challenger and two-term state Sen. David Rouzer can request a recount if the margin remains a 1% or less. Both candidates have until November 20 to request a recount. Gary Bartlett, the executive director for the State Board of Elections in North Carolina, said officials should know if Rouzer intends to request a recount before the November 20 deadline.

"New York (CNN) -- New York City's billionaire three-term mayor has tapped into his personal fortune to further the cause of same-sex marriage, donating $250,000 to support the issue in Maryland where voters will get the chance to weigh in at the ballot box come November. ""Maryland will always hold a special place in my heart. ... So when Governor (Martin) O'Malley asked me to support Question 6, I didn't hesitate,"" said Michael Bloomberg, who attended college at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Maryland residents are scheduled to cast their ballot November 6 on what's known as Question 6, voting either to uphold or strike down a bill legalizing same-sex marriage that was signed into law in March by O'Malley. With the law, Maryland joined seven states and Washington, D.C., in allowing gay couples to wed, but it isn't scheduled to take effect until January 1, giving both its opponents and advocates a chance to ratchet up campaign efforts to sway voters. Bloomberg, who has been a staunch supporter of gay rights in New York, made the donation earlier this month, according to a Friday statement from City Hall spokesman John McCarthy. Currently, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. In February, Washington state Gov. Christine Gregoire signed a bill into law that legalizes same-sex marriage, but that state similarly faces a referendum challenge in November. Both Maine and Minnesota are also voting on the issue November 6. Five states -- Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey and Rhode Island -- currently allow civil unions that provide rights similar to marriage. In California, a federal appeals court ruled against a voter-passed referendum that outlawed same-sex marriage. It said such a ban was unconstitutional and that it singled out gays and lesbians for discrimination. That case appears to be eventually headed to the U.S. Supreme Court.","Maryland residents are scheduled to cast their ballot November 6 .

"(CNN) -- Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge were both on hand to give an elite football facility aimed at ending England's 46-year wait for a second World Cup triumph the royal seal of approval. The $168-million St. George's Park complex in the town of Burton-upon-Trent, which has taken 18 months to build, will house all 24 England teams from junior hopefuls through to senior stars. ""Coming here this morning, seeing these wonderful facilities and beautiful surroundings -- just experiencing this extraordinary place - gave me the same feelings I had when I first went to the Olympic Park,"" William, who is president of the English Football Association (FA) declared. England's new national headquarters in the county of Staffordshire is hoping to inspire its footballers and prolong the feelgood factor left by a landmark sporting summer in the UK after London hosted the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Crime and punishment in sport: Laying down the law? ""St. George's Park, and the concept that underpins it, is something totally new,"" continued William. ""It will be far more than just a world class facility for training our future world-beating national team. ""It is more than just the university from which thousands of highly qualified coaches will graduate. It is also a magnificent example of the sort of social initiative that brings opportunity and purpose to wider British life. ""It will provide employment and a social hub for local people and, through the thousands of volunteers on which coaching relies, it will foster community spirit, purpose and hope throughout England.""‬‪ . FA chairman David Bernstein hailed the facility as well as expressing his delight that the royal couple had been able to attend the grand opening. The opening of St. George's Park is a beacon of good news for English football after a year that has tainted by the racism allegations leveled against Chelsea captain John Terry, that prompted his international retirement. Just last week Chelsea and England defender Ashley Cole called the FA a ""bunch of twats"" after an independent report that found Terry guilty stated Cole's evidence to the inquiry had ""evolved"" over time. Bernstein revealed Cole had apologized in person for his tweet but was keen to focus on the potential benefits St. George's Park would bring to the national team. ""The range of functions here are so great,"" Bernstein said on the organization's website. ""It's a coaching center, it's a sports science center, a rehabilitation center. ""It's a fantastic thing for football and for The Football Association. This has been 20 years in development. ""A huge amount of work has gone in to it. And to have our president, the Duke of Cambridge, and the Duchess to open this facility is really fantastic. ""There is so much built into this project. It's an inspirational place as well, the pinnacle of things that are happening elsewhere around the country. We are trying to do so much with youth development generally, and this represents the pinnacle of that."" The complex mirrors similar facilities in other European countries, such as France's center of excellence at Clairefontaine which produced the nucleus of the team which won the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000. In addition to Clairefontaine -- which aided the development of players such as Thierry Henry and Nicolas Anelka -- the English Football Association also drew inspiration from Zeist in Holland, Cologne in Germany, Spain's La Ciudad del Futbol and Coverciano in Italy. English football's powerbrokers will hope St. George's Park can help England win the FIFA World Cup for the first time in 46 years. ""Initially we'll get our 24 teams using St. George's Park,"" explained the FA's director of football development Trevor Brooking. ""You'd like to see a youngster coming in here at 15 and get the 'wow factor' and want to stay with the England teams throughout the age groups, U17s through to under-21s and seniors."" St George's Park boasts 11 outdoor pitches including an exact replica of the playing surface at Wembley Stadium, an altitude chamber to replicate playing in different climates and a 60-meter sprint track aimed at monitoring running speed and style. Apart from state-of-the-art facilities, what will a centralized hub offer English football which is does not have already? ""The FA's locations have always been disconnected from the realities of grassroots football,"" explains Pavl Williams, editor of thecoachingmanual.com. ""They now have a location which is central to the rest of the country and accessible to a broader range of society. ""It's also a central location where lots of organizations are working together, which is necessary if you are going to pull out a consistent philosophy at every level of the game, which is what we are trying to do."" Tuesday's opening marks the end of a lengthy process for English football. A national soccer hub was first mooted back in the late 90s. Many observers have highlighted the lack of a core philosophy and antiquated coaching methods as a reason for England stagnating while more technically-gifted teams like Spain have flourished. ""The way football is going to progress in the country is through working together,"" continued Williams. ""We need to create something which is bigger than the sum of its parts. ""St. George's Park can bring in more agencies which work really well together and get that out to coaches working at a grassroots level."" One of the key areas St. George's Park will look to address is the coaching which is given to promising English talent. Williams outlined a lack a UEFA A Licensed coaches at grassroots level as a key difference between England and continental Europe, as well as suggesting over coaching can cause some youngsters to burn out. ""A lot of kid's coaching is hands off coaching,"" said Williams. ""The more you educate a coach, the more they learn when to not step in and coach. ""Facilities, like the pitches you play on, are a big issue for technical players. But in coaching specifically, kids in other countries are allowed to express themselves more.""","The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge officially open St. George's Park .

"Sydney (CNN) -- As Australia digests the government's recent call for deeper engagement with Asia -- and China in particular -- one Australian billionaire with interests in China has offered some advice. ""Stop viewing China like it's the Cold War,"" James Packer, who owns multimillion dollar casino businesses in Australia and Macau, said at a recent tourism forum. ""Start viewing them as a modern member of the industrialized world."" The Chairman of Crown Entertainment Group, Packer wants what he calls ""frosty relations"" between Australia and China to ease. And the sooner the better, for his business at least. ""Chinese tourism is changing the world,"" Packer told a business audience in Sydney last week and he wants a bigger slice of the action. Along with other non-mining industries, Australian companies are looking beyond the pits, as the government's new ""Asia Century"" policy urges the country to do. Chief among the goals are that every child learn an Asian language -- in particular, Mandarin, Japanese, Indonesian or Hindi -- and that they leave school having studied Asian culture by 2025. December marks 40 years of diplomatic relations between Australia and the People's Republic but as Packer and the Australian Premier Julia Gillard similarly bemoan, Australians still tend to see China through a historical lens as predatory and alien with its cheap labor an abiding economic threat. And Australia is not alone, if the anti-Beijing rhetoric in the U.S. presidential election is any indication. Yet the disconnect between this attitude and the economic reality is wide. China remains Australia's number one trading partner. In 2010-11, China was Australia's largest two-way trading partner for goods and services, with trade topping $113.3 billion, up 26% on the previous year. China accounts for 14.7% of the total trade of goods and services and takes one quarter of Australian exports. There's little doubt the Australian economy is heavily reliant, some contend overly reliant, on China's doing well. But Tim Harcourt, a fellow in economics at the Australian School of Business, says not even the recent slowing of the Chinese economy is likely to impact negatively on Australia in the long term. ""Even as a short term slowing in China occurs, a lot of the long term projects particularly in infrastructure are locked in and that is what drives our demands,"" Harcourt told CNN. While trade in iron ore, coal and liquid natural gas largely dominates Australian exports to China, Harcourt sees a bigger and very different picture. ""Beyond commodities, engagement is deep and it's probably the untold story,"" he said. ""There are architects like PTW building the Water Cube (National Aquatics Centre) in Beijing or the former Ansett employees at ASC setting up flight monitoring systems at Chinese airports or the Australian aquarium building company (OCEANIS), which is creating Shanghai's first marine park,"" said Harcourt. ""I think ties are expanding and deepening. The figure I see is that of small and medium sized (Australian) enterprises. They will go more to China than Europe and other traditional markets."" Most agree a free trade agreement would help. Negotiations are now in their eighth year with no deal in sight. Former Australian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd -- a Mandarin speaker with a deep but hard-nosed understanding of China -- told CNN he believes the agreement will happen. ""These are matters which are highly sensitive on the Chinese side. They have sensitivities about agriculture, and on the Australian side we want to ensure it is comprehensive and provides access for all manufacturers, not just resources and energy but includes the services sector,"" he said. ""Under the new leadership their own economic future will be identified as requiring further reform - domestically in the Chinese market and further with international market openings. This is essential to their growth model,"" he told CNN. The frequent outbursts of concern in Australia at the degree of Chinese state investment in agricultural land and businesses can't help negotiations. Figures are hard to come by, because only purchases above the A$244 million threshold require Australian government permission. But according to a 2011 report by the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics and Sciences, only 1% of Australian agricultural businesses are part or fully owned by foreign interests and 44 million hectares of agricultural land are now wholly or partly owned by foreign entities. Still, investments by Chinese state-owned enterprises tend to make headlines across Australia. There was concern when Shenhua Watermark Coal invested hundreds of millions of dollars in thermal coal exploration licenses in New South Wales. Similarly, when China's largest diary producer, the state owned Bright Foods snapped up a majority stake in Australian food manufacturer, Manassen, eyebrows were raised. Most recently, when the government green-lighted the sale of Australia's largest cotton farm, Cubbie Station in Queensland, to a private Chinese-Japanese consortium, some in the coalition opposition called for the review threshold to be lowered and the decision to be reversed. Harcourt says the xenophobic tone of the debate isn't exclusive to Australia. ""That's pretty commonplace around the world. I've been in Brazil, Columbia, Peru, Chile, Europe, Africa and Canada, and I hear the same thing about Chinese investment,"" he said. ""I don't think the Chinese understand the criticism and get very hurt by it,"" he said. Rudd says the critical issue is that Chinese investment makes sense for both parties. ""There are huge opportunities (for Australia) for direct sales into the Chinese market. It takes two to tango for the Chinese,"" he told CNN. Still, the perception lingers that Australia has only nailed the basics for a strategic, profitable relationship with China, ruled by a party it is politely forbidden to criticize. Differences on human rights issues -- in particular the fate of the Falun Gong, the status of Tibet and the way the Chinese government deals more generally with dissent -- have often stymied relations. In 2008, Rudd looked to new regional diplomatic architecture to bridge the divide between economic necessity and understanding. However, his successor, Julia Gillard, appears to have ditched the idea of an Asia Pacific Community in which the United States, Japan, China, Russia and Australia commune on political, economic and security matters in favor of a reinvigorated East Asia Summit, in which the United States and Russia have observer status. Rudd is sanguine about the impact of this on Australia -- China economic relations. ""The mechanism is less important than the substance,"" he said. ""If you look at the level of economic engagement, it is already substantial. ""The next step will hang on two things - the implementation of China's new growth model which will be implemented by the new leadership. The second is Australia's corporate leadership. Government can't do everything,"" he said. As Australia grapples with how best to deepen engagement, China looks to hit 7.5% growth this year. The International Monetary Fund predicts China will grow 7.8% this year and hit 8.2% growth in 2013. Harcourt is upbeat. ""We are hugging the panda,"" he said. ""Ultimately China needs Australia for its food and energy needs. And increasingly it's looking to Australia for professional services to urbanize its population and bring more people into the middle class. ""And for Australia that means China will be a key player,"" he said, before adding ""but not only player.""","Australia's economy is increasingly tied to China, yet attitudes remain ""cold war""
A recent white paper says Australia needs to embrace ""the Asian Century"" to thrive .

"(EW.com) -- Liam Neeson has had an indisputably amazing year. Though the quality of the actor's movies remains up for debate (We're looking at you, Battleship. Well, you too, Wrath of the Titans. Oh gosh, The Grey as well. And, as much as I hate to say it, perhaps even The Dark Knight Rises... don't stone me!), the fact that 60-year-old Neeson is at the peak of his career, recognized as an almost mythic Chuck Norris-esque figure and opening a new action tentpole every couple of months, is nothing short of remarkable. And now Neeson has another chart-topper to add to his already impressive resume: Taken 2, which debuted to an astounding $50 million from 3,661 theaters this weekend, good for a sizzling $13,657 per theater average. Taken 2's debut is the third-best ever in the month of October, behind 2011′s Paranormal Activity 3, which started with $52.6 million, and 2010′s Jackass 3D, which started with $50.4 million. The revenge sequel also earned more than twice as much as the original Taken did in its opening weekend — that film surprised Hollywood when it bowed with $24.7 million in 2009, and it also served as the catalyst for Neeson's career jumpstart. Thanks to great word-of-mouth, Taken chugged all the way to $145 million total. Time will tell whether Taken 2 can match its predecessor's gross, but that may prove challenging. While the film did score a solid ""B+"" CinemaScore grade, reviews were even harsher this time around and much has been made of the fact that Taken 2's storyline adheres so closely to the original. (Of course, this didn't exactly crush The Hangover Part II.) Thanks to up-front excitement, Taken 2 will almost certainly fall hard in the weeks to come, but considering Fox spent just $42 million to make the film, that won't matter. This is already a huge winner for everyone involved. Hotel Transylvania finished the weekend in second place, falling by an excellent 38 percent to $26.3 million. Sony's $85 million animated venture has earned $76 million in its first ten days — far ahead of Sony Pictures Animation's most successful performer, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, which had earned $60.5 million at the same point in its run. With Halloween still three weeks away — and competition like Frankenweenie apparently not a threat — the Adam Sandler-voiced kiddie flick will continue to hold well at the box office and glide right past the $100 million mark. In third was Universal's $17 million a cappella comedy Pitch Perfect, which earned a solid $14.7 million out of 2,770 theaters. Thanks to strong pre-release buzz — Pitch Perfect garnered an ""A"" CinemaScore grade and Universal opened the film a week early in 335 theaters last weekend-- the singing competition flick hit a box office high note with $5.1 million. Though its per theater average understandably dropped from $15,371 to a still-strong $5,320 due to its expansion, Pitch Perfect is already a big success story. When the original trailer hit the net earlier this year, Pitch Perfect appeared to be an ill-conceived companion to marginally popular teen titles like Step Up or You Got Served. But thanks to a dose of Glee-ful vocals and strong reviews overall, the film no longer looks like a direct-to-DVD sibling of Bring It On 5: High-Five, We're Alive! (We kid.) In fact, Pitch Perfect may just be a new Bring It On in its own right. The zeitgeisty film was cheap to make and is now well on its way to profitability. Plus, it seems tailor-made for home market success with young women (74 percent of Pitch Perfect's opening weekend audience was female) and repeat-viewing. While Pitch Perfect may never earn as much as Taken 2 did in its first three days, it will end up being a well-liked success story for Universal. Looper enjoyed a second weekend in fourth place, dropping by an encouraging 41 percent to $12.2 million. TriStar's well-reviewed $35 million time-bending thriller, which stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis, has now earned $40.3 million after 10 days, and it could climb as high as $65 million total. A nice example of original content clicking with audiences. (See, Hollywood? It is possible!) Rounding out the Top 5 was Disney's Tim Burton-directed Frankenweenie, the kooky, spooky tale which debuted with a rather disappointing $11.5 million. The $39 million film, about a boy trying to resurrect his deceased pooch, just didn't click with audiences. There are a few factors at play here. For starters, domestic moviegoers traditionally don't like stop-motion animation all that much. The Pirates! Band of Misfits proved that earlier this year, when it sailed away with just $31.1 million. Furthermore, it likely didn't help that Frankenweenie was in black and white — kids are used to bright, candy-colored options like Madagascar or Toy Story. Frankenweenie didn't fit that mold. On top of that, there's been a glut of creepy-ish kiddie titles in the marketplace lately. Not only is the well-performing Hotel Transylvania cleaning up at the box office with its own brand of monstrous mayhem, Laika's ParaNorman (which has earned $54.4 million so far) had a similar Frankensteinian sensibility. How many animated movies about undead characters do families really want to see in the course of two months? The sad part for Disney is that critics loved the film. Frankenweenie earned wonderful reviews overall and a ""B+"" CinemaScore grade. Perhaps it can find its legs in the weeks to come. 1. Taken 2 -- $50.0 million . 2. Hotel Transylvania -- $26.3 million . 3. Pitch Perfect -- $14.7 million . 4. Looper -- $12.2 million . 5. Frankenweenie -- $11.5 miilion .

"Manama, Bahrain (CNN) -- Clashes broke out in Bahrain on Friday as authorities tried to prevent thousands of opposition supporters converging on a mosque to hear a sermon from the kingdom's most prominent Shia cleric, Sheikh Isa Qassim. The unrest followed a series of bombings in the capital, Manama, earlier this week, and the government's decision to strip some 31 opposition activists of their citizenship. Amid the unrest Friday, a teenage boy was knocked over by a car and killed as he crossed a busy road in the area. Sixteen-year-old Ali Abbas Radhi had been detained by police, according to witnesses and his family, and then escaped. They said he was hit by the car as he was pursued. The Ministry of Interior said Radhi was killed as he tried to cross the road, but made no reference to his being arrested. Bahrain strips Shiite activists of citizenship amid unrest . The Bahraini opposition is made up largely of the kingdom's Shiite majority, which has long complained that it is marginalized under the rule of the Sunni al Khalifa dynasty. As the Arab Spring erupted last year, opposition groups twice occupied the island's famous Pearl Roundabout, until protestors were dispersed in a security crackdown in March 2011. The opposition had called prayers Friday to support Sheikh Qassim, who has come under attack in pro-government media for meeting the Iranian consul in Bahrain. Authorities summoned the Iranian charge d'affaires in Manama last month to complain about the meeting. A large number of police had sealed off access to the mosque in the village of Diraz. Witnesses say many worshippers abandoned their cars and tried to reach the mosque on foot. Police fired tear gas to prevent people from reaching Diraz, according to witnesses. The Ministry of Interior in a statement said the roads had been closed to prevent ""vandals from outside the area"" from gathering, after receiving information that protests were planned. Earlier this week, authorities said the 31 people stripped of their Bahraini nationality had harmed state security. They included three former members of parliament and several opposition figures. A leading cleric, Ayatollah Hussein Al-Najati, also lost his Bahraini nationality. Ayatollah Al-Najati is the representative in Bahrain of Iraq's Grand Ayatollah Ali al Sistani, whose teachings are widely followed by the island's Shiite communities. Bahrain says ban on protests is response to rising violence . In his sermon Friday, Ayatollah Qassim criticized both the move to deprive Bahrainis of their nationality and bomb explosions this week in Manama, which killed two Indian workers. He also called for only peaceful forms of protest. Attempts at political dialogue between the government and opposition parties have made little progress, and there's been an uptick in violence in recent weeks. Condemning the bombings, the U.S. State Department said this week that violence had ""claimed the lives of protesters, of security forces, of innocent bystanders."" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the violence ""undercuts the process of national reconciliation that we have strongly been urging on Bahrainis of all stripes."" On Friday Nuland welcomed a declaration of non-violence by six opposition parties. But Ayham Kamel, an analyst with the Eurasia Group, said that ""Shia hardliners that condone the use of violence, such as Haq and the 14 February movement, are likely to use the wave of attacks to reinforce their rising popularity."" Since anti-government protests began in February 2011, more than 100 civilians and at least six police officers have been killed in sporadic violence.","Prominent Shia cleric Qassim delivered sermon .

"(CNN) -- Doctors distributed antibiotics to passengers aboard an Italian cruise ship after four crew members were diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, Italy's health ministry reported Monday. All four were taken to hospitals in the Italian port of Livorno after the crew of the MSC Orchestra reported the illnesses, the ministry said. More than 2,800 doses of the antibiotics ciprofloxacin and rifampicin were issued for passengers, and the ministry said passengers who have disembarked in the past week should take similar precautions. The 294-meter (965-foot), 2,500-passenger Orchestra is currently in the French port of Villefranche sur Mer, on the outskirts of Nice, and the ministry said Italian authorities have notified their French counterparts. MSC, the passenger arm of Italy's Mediterranean Shipping Company, said it was doing ""everything necessary to safeguard the health of its guests and all the crew members."" Meningitis outbreak: Your questions answered . The crew members were diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis, which attacks the lining of the brain and the spinal cord. The disease is passed by close contact with respiratory secretions or saliva, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. ""The strand was found in the crew that worked in the kitchen and that, therefore, they should not have had continuous and close contact with passengers,"" the Health Ministry noted. Two of the four cases were identified as Meningitis C. The cases involve a different disease than the outbreak of fungal meningitis now being seen in the United States. Eight people have died after being injected with steroids contaminated by a fungus, the CDC reported Monday.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- One of four Hong Kong women struck down with septic shock after receiving a ""beauty"" treatment normally given to cancer patients has died. The 46-year-old died Wednesday morning at a local hospital one week after receiving DC-CIK therapy through the DR beauty center, local authorities said. According to the Hong Kong Health Department, the DC-CIK procedure involves the ""concentration and processing of blood taken from the person, and subsequent infusion of the mixture back into the patient."" It's not clear whether any of the women who received the treatment had been diagnosed with cancer, though the Hong Kong Health Department said in an earlier statement that the 46-year-old had been in ""good past health."" The woman, who has only been identified by authorities by her surname ""Chan,"" was admitted to hospital last Thursday suffering fever and diarrhea, hours after receiving the treatment. She was diagnosed with septic shock, and on Sunday authorities announced her blood samples had grown the bacterium Mycobacterium abscessus. Dr. Ho Pak-leung, President of the University of Hong Kong's Center for Infection told CNN that, under normal circumstances, M. abscessus did not pose a threat to healthy people. ""It's common, it's widespread. It can be found in dust and soil and water. People often come into contact with a small number of this bacteria and it's of no harm at all unless you have a wound,"" Dr. Ho said. However, he said it appeared as though the bacteria had entered the woman's blood. ""For blood infection involving internal organs, it's very difficult. It has to involve multiple drugs given at the same time and there are uncertainties about the effectiveness of the treatment,"" he told CNN on Monday. Three other women remain in hospital after having the treatment, health authorities said Wednesday. A 60-year-old is in critical condition, a 56-year-old woman is in serious condition, while another, 59, is stable. Dr. Ho said the use of the DC-CIK treatment for cosmetic purposes was not something he'd ever heard of before. ""I have serious doubts about the medical and scientific basis of the treatment,"" he said. Professor KY Yuen, Chair of Infectious Diseases at the University of Hong Kong's Department of Microbiology, said the procedure was ""only indicated for patients with metastatic cancer and often as salvage therapy when there are no other feasible options."" The Hong Kong Health Department and police are investigating the matter but, as of Wednesday morning, police said no arrests had been made. Health authorities have instructed the DR beauty clinic to halt the procedure. Over the weekend, the founder of DR, Dr. Stephen Chow Heung-wing, told local media that his staff referred clients to an independent doctor who administered the therapy. He denied suggestions that it was offered as a medical treatment. The clinic has yet to respond to CNN requests for reaction to Wednesday's death. ""I didn't say that it can cure any diseases. Remember that we are a beauty clinic. We refer clients to doctor(s), and we have had the clients to sign a liability-free form, which states that it is not for medical use,"" he said. A statement on the beauty clinic's website says that the treatment ""was conducted by an independent doctor at a medical clinic, and the doctor is not hired by our beauty store."" The statement also said it was up to the independent doctor to decide whether the client is suitable for treatment before he or she receives it. It added: ""We will assist related government departments to find out the causation of this particular incident."" According to its website, the DR group of clinics was established in 1995 and provides services for more than 1,000 clients each day. The 'Wild West' of medicine .

"New York (CNN) -- Residents of the northeastern United States, still reeling from the havoc Sandy wreaked October 29 on the region, learned Wednesday that the same holds true for snow and wind, which buffeted the coast in the form of a nor'easter. More than 600,000 households who have been without power since October 29 hunkered down for a long, cold night. ""While this storm is not as dangerous as Sandy was, New Yorkers should still take safety precautions today and tonight,"" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters Wednesday. By 10 p.m., some four inches of snow had fallen on Staten Island, the borough of New York that was hard hit by Sandy. Parts of Connecticut saw more than eight inches. ""It's Mother Nature's one-two punch,"" Cory Baker, mayor of Newark, New Jersey, told CNN's ""Piers Morgan."" ""It's testing the resolve and the grit of my state and my city and, obviously, this region."" Some 25,000 residents of Newark had still been without power from Sandy, he said. ""Now, this is being dumped; it has the potential to knock out more power within my state."" Indeed, that is what happened. Power outages in New York and New Jersey rose from 607,000 during the day to 652,000 customers by 10 p.m. Soon after, Elizabeth Flagler, a spokeswoman for the Long Island Power Authority, said the company had tallied 100,000 new power outages since the storm began, bringing its total to 193,000. ""We're getting hit pretty hard between the snow and the wind,"" she said. Forecasters predicted gusts of up to 60 mph in shore towns and cities across New York and New Jersey, bringing 2- to 4-foot storm surges just as homes and office buildings had begun to dry out and floodwaters to recede after Sandy. Coastal erosion caused by last week's storm sparked fears of more flooding in storm-battered communities, while incoming cold weather was expected to hamper utility restoration efforts across the region. Cold brings fresh misery to Sandy victims . Bloomberg urged residents in the city's low-lying areas -- especially Breezy Point, Hamilton Beach and Gerritsen Beach -- to ""consider going someplace else tonight, to be a little bit on the safe side."" But he issued no mandatory evacuation orders, other than for a handful of chronic-care facilities and an adult-care center in areas that were hit hard by Sandy. ""If people think you're crying wolf, the next time, when it's really a serious threat, they might not do it,"" the mayor said. That was not the case in New Jersey, where the Brick Township Office of Emergency Management had issued a mandatory evacuation order for all residents of low-lying waterfront areas of town. Meanwhile, freezing temperatures ushered in snow and potentially deadly conditions for those without shelter, as displaced residents struggled to stay warm with generators and blankets. Others continued to camp with family and neighbors as they awaited the return of electricity. On Tuesday night, about 8,500 Sandy victims had taken refuge in more than 100 Red Cross shelters. Temperatures were expected to dip again Wednesday night into the 20s, forecasters said. Shelters were opened across the city for displaced residents or those without power. ""We think we're ready for anything,"" said Bloomberg, who ordered patrol officers to use their cruisers' loudspeakers to encourage elderly or homebound residents to go somewhere warm and safe and advised residents to check on neighbors. Bloomberg tells struggling New Yorkers to get off the road . More than a week after Sandy struck the Northeast, its death toll in New York City climbed to 41 as a 78-year-old man died Tuesday of injuries suffered in the storm, police said. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo fired his chief of emergency management, Steven Kuhr, for having arranged for the Suffolk County Office of Emergency Management to clear a tree from his driveway, a Cuomo administration source told CNN. CNN was not able to reach Kuhr. The continuing recovery effort had already left thousands of area residents tired, homeless and looking for answers. New York City's Penn Station was shut for a time on Wednesday evening because of overcrowding after the Long Island Railroad halted service systemwide, Metropolitan Transit Authority spokeswoman Marjorie Anders told CNN. The stations reopened later in the evening and service resumed, she said. As many as 20,000 households across New York City and Westchester County were not expected to be back online by the weekend because of damage to their homes' electrical systems, officials said. Contractors will need to check the electrical wiring in each home and business to ensure that power can be safely restored, Bloomberg said. Salt-caked wiring could ignite once the power is restored. Superstorm Sandy's victims . On Long Island's hard-hit coast, towns such as Oceanside remained largely without power. ""The lights came on for three minutes here. Everybody cheered like A-Rod (Alex Rodriguez) hit one out at Yankee Stadium,"" said Rick Wolkenberg. ""Then there was this weird hum and everything went out again. They teased us, and now we're sitting here in the dark again."" The 59-year-old mortgage lender said his staff has been working for days in his office by means of a small generator and flashlights. ""Everyone's really frazzled, angry,"" he said. ""It's not just the power. Now it's getting an electrician to evaluate the house, then getting a plumber -- and nobody's coming because they're all overwhelmed."" His 81-year-old mother, Edith, moved in with his family after Sandy slammed through her home in Oceanside. ""There just seems so many obstacles now,"" Wolkenberg said. ""It is like a war zone down there,"" Gov. Chris Christie said, referring to places such as Ocean County's Mantoloking, where flooding and fires wiped out large sections of the town last week. At least 20 homes burned to the ground there, mirroring an incident in Breezy Point, a Queens neighborhood where a cluster of more than 100 houses caught fire during the storm. ""We don't know what to expect for the flooding situation as the shorelines have been changed,"" Christie said. ""For many of them, the dunes are gone. So, moderate flooding under normal conditions becomes major in these conditions."" More than three-fourths of New Jersey's school systems were operating Wednesday and 1,728 public schools were open in New York. Elsewhere, there were signs of the region rebounding. The PATH train between New Jersey and New York resumed limited service under the Hudson River on Tuesday, after being shut ahead of the storm. Commuter traffic reopened Wednesday in the Holland Tunnel, where about 91,000 vehicles typically pass under the Hudson River between Manhattan and Jersey City, New Jersey. Air travel continued to be affected. Authorities advised air travelers to check with their carriers ahead of the storm. ""Airlines serving the Port Authority's major airports -- Newark Liberty International, John F. Kennedy International and LaGuardia -- have canceled all or a significant number of their flights beginning at noon today and continuing through early tomorrow,"" the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said Wednesday in a statement.

"(CNN) -- Fresh lava and ash spewed Sunday from a volcano in northeast Indonesia, casting haze over the crater and prompting authorities to warn nearby residents, state news reported. Loud, thumping noises were heard at a monitoring post 6 kilometers (3.8 miles) from where Mount Lokon erupted around 2:05 p.m. (2:05 a.m. ET) Sunday, said Sutupo Purwo Nugroho of Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Board, as reported by the official Antara news agency. Read more: The supervolcano that could threaten Earth . The volatile activity continued after that, though authorities could not immediately ascertain how many additional, separate eruptions had occurred. ""Right now, there are still eruptions, but they could not be observed as the volcano is covered by haze,"" said Nugroho. Those living within 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) of the volcano, which is in the Pacific island nation's North Sulawesi province, are being told to limit outdoor activity, according to Nugroho, who heads the mitigation board's data and information center. The volcano has been active since last Friday, with some eruptions spewing ash 1,500 meters into the air. One day earlier, officials issued an early warning to residents -- yet Mount Lokon was still categorized as idle until Sunday, as it is now on alert status. Indonesia is on the ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. According to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History's Global Volcanism Program, Lokon is the higher of twin volcanic peaks separated by 2.2 kilometers (1.4 miles) in northeast Indonesia. At 800 meters (2,600 feet) high and with a flat top, it is one of the most active volcanoes in the region. In February, for instance, the restless volcano spewed clouds of ash 2 kilometers into the sky, said Indonesia's disaster management agency. Residents at that time were warned to stay away from the volcano, but not to leave their homes, Nugroho said. That was unlike in July 2011, when a series of Lokon eruptions prompted the evacuation of more than 4,000 locals.

"London (CNN) -- A hearing into whether a Muslim cleric who has been described as ""more radical than Osama bin Laden"" can avoid deportation from Britain to stand trial in Jordan began Wednesday in London. Britain has been trying to deport Abu Qatada for years, but his legal appeals have kept him in the United Kingdom. He is accused of funding terrorist groups and is said to have inspired one of the 9/11 hijackers. Profile: Abu Qatada: the preacher at the eye of the storm . In January, the European Court of Human Rights blocked Britain from sending him to Jordan because of fears that evidence obtained by torture could be used against him at the trial planned by the Middle Eastern country. Britain then launched a round of negotiations with Jordan in order to deal with the court's concerns and arrested Abu Qatada again on April 17. The following month, the European Court rejected an appeal by his lawyers to avoid deportation. The decision set the stage for the latest hearing in front of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, which will hear three witnesses in person. The hearing is expected to last several days. The high court judge who manages the commission is likely to give his ruling a few weeks after the appeal concludes, a court official said. A significant portion of the hearing will be closed to the media and sometimes also to Abu Qatada's defense team, because matters of national security are to be discussed. Who is Abu Qatada? Also known as Omar Othman, Abu Qatada is a militant Palestinian preacher who has been held in high-security British jails for more than six years. Read more: UK wins round in Qatada deportation battle . Videos of his preaching were found in a German apartment used by some of those involved in the 9/11 attacks on the United States, including ringleader Mohammed Atta. Counter-terrorism sources said Abu Qatada was a big influence on Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian who would emerge as al Qaeda's leader in Iraq. What is he accused of? The British government says Abu Qatada raised money for terrorist groups, including organizations linked to former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, and has publicly supported the violent activities of those groups. Abu Qatada has denied the allegations against him. Why is he wanted in Jordan? In 2000, Jordan convicted him in absentia for a plot to bomb tourists in the country to celebrate the new millennium. He was also convicted for his role in two terrorist attacks in the country in 1998. Read more: Al Qaeda says it'll free captive if UK releases Abu Qatada . Jordan has said it will quash that conviction and retry him. Why is he fighting deportation? Abu Qatada has said deportation would put him at risk of torture and lengthy pretrial detention. Lawyers presenting his appeal question whether the evidence against him in the two cases he faces in Jordan is sound, or whether it has come from someone who was tortured and is therefore tainted. They also question whether Abu Qatada can expect a fair trial in Jordan. When did he arrive in the United Kingdom? Using a forged United Arab Emirates passport, Abu Qatada arrived in the United Kingdom in 1993 and sought asylum for himself, his wife and their three children, according to court documents. He said Jordanian authorities had tortured him. The British government recognized him as a refugee and allowed him to stay in the country until 1998. Abu Qatada applied to stay indefinitely, but while his application was pending, a Jordanian court convicted him in absentia of the terrorism charges. What does he preach? As a preacher in London mosques, Abu Qatada gained a militant following. In 1999, he allegedly sought to justify the killing of Jews, including children, and attacking Americans. In 2001, three days after the 9/11 attacks in the United States, Abu Qatada preached that the attacks were part of a global struggle between Christianity and Islam, and were a response to America's unjust policies. In another sermon, he sought to justify the killing by a Muslim of a ""nonbeliever"" for the sake of Islam. Writing in The New Yorker in 2006, Lawrence Wright quotes a Saudi journalist who had met Abu Qatada in the early 1990s. Jamal Khashoggi said ""Abu Qatada had struck him as far more radical than Osama bin Laden ... influenced by Salafism, the puritanical, fundamentalist strain of Islam."" Has he been convicted of a crime in Britain? He was first detained in the United Kingdom in 2002 under sweeping anti-terror legislation enacted after 9/11 -- along with dozens of other Islamist militants. He was released briefly in 2005 after the repeal of the law. Later that year, British authorities ordered his renewed detention under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. No evidence has been produced in a British court to suggest he was involved with specific al Qaeda conspiracies. As one popular tweet puts it: ""Abu Qatada has not even been convicted of a parking offense in Britain."" Why not? Two reasons. Authorities say they are unwilling to produce evidence in open court that might prove some operational or direct link to terrorism for fear of compromising intelligence sources. Second, it is notoriously difficult to prove a crime has been committed by the use of words that influence others' actions. Who is the other cleric recently extradited from Britain? Radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri, just extradited from Britain to the United States, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to 11 counts of terrorism. His hearing in a U.S. court came after he lost a lengthy legal battle to avoid extradition to the United States from London. Al-Masri has called the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center ""a towering day in history"" and described bin Laden as ""a good guy and a hero."" The charges against al-Masri include conspiracy in connection with a 1998 kidnapping of 16 Westerners in Yemen, and conspiring with others to establish an Islamic jihad training camp in rural Oregon in 1999. If convicted, al-Masri could be sentenced to life in prison. CNN's Jonathan Wald, Tim Lister, Richard Roth and Olivia Smith contributed to this report.","Abu Qatada was convicted in absentia of terror-related charges in Jordan .

"(CNN) -- The wife of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama told CNN's Larry King on Wednesday that she is not offended by a much-publicized comment made toward her husband in Tuesday night's debate. Michelle Obama talks about Williams Ayers, Hillary Clinton and her husband's campaign on Larry King Live. In the presidential matchup at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, GOP nominee John McCain criticized his Democratic rival for supporting the 2007 Bush-Cheney energy bill. ""It was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate, loaded down with goodies, billions for oil companies, and it was sponsored by Bush and Cheney. ... You know who voted for it? You might never know. That one,"" he said, gesturing toward Obama. ""You know who voted against it? Me."" When asked whether McCain's reference to Obama as ""that one"" was offensive, Michelle Obama simply said ""No,"" adding that the issue has nothing to do with what's affecting average Americans hurting from the economic downturn. ""I think there are two conversations that have been going on throughout this whole election. There's the conversation that's been happening with the pundits ... and then there's the conversation that's been happening on the ground,"" she said.  Watch Michelle Obama talk about McCain's comment » . She said Americans ""right now are scared"" and ""nervous about the economy."" ""They don't care about the back and forth between the candidates. ... They want real answers about how we're going to fix this economy and get the health care benefits on track so, you know, this is part of politics,"" she added. King asked Obama about the McCain camp bringing up her husband's ties to William Ayers. Ayers was a founding member of the Weather Underground, a 1960s radical group known for bombings of police stations, the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol. Fact Check: Is Obama 'palling around with terrorists'? Ayers is a university professor who lives on the South Side of Chicago, where Obama cut his political teeth. Michelle Obama said her husband served on a Chicago education board with Ayers. ""I don't know anyone in Chicago who is heavily involved in education policy who doesn't know Bill Ayers,"" she said. ""But, you know, again I go back to the point that, you know, the American people aren't asking these questions."" ""You don't think it affects the campaign?"" King asked. ""You know, I think that we've been in this for 20 months and people have gotten to know Barack. He's written a book, books have been written about him. He, like all of the other candidates have been thoroughly vetted. And I think people know Barack Obama.  Watch Michelle Obama discuss William Ayers » . ""They know his heart, they know his spirit, and the thing that I just encourage people is to judge Barack and judge all of these candidates based on what they do, their actions, their character, what they do in their lives rather than what somebody [else] did when they were 8."" Michelle Obama was referring to the fact that Ayers allegedly committed his most radical acts when Barack Obama was a child. McCain's running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, has lobbed some intense attacks on Barack Obama over the Ayers issue. ""Our opponent is someone who sees America as imperfect enough to pal around with terrorists who targeted their own country,"" Palin told a crowd of supporters this week. King played the clip and asked Michelle Obama if that statement made her ""mad."" Obama replied, ""I don't watch it."" ""What do you make of her running for a vice president and having many kids and being a good parent and bouncing all the balls?"" King asked. ""I think she provides an excellent of example of all the different roles that women can and should play,"" Michelle Obama responded. ""I'm a mother with kids and I've had a career and I've had to juggle. She's doing publicly what so many women are doing on their own privately. What we're fighting for is to make sure that all women have the choices that Sarah Palin and I have."" At one point, King asked her if her husband likes McCain. ""Do these two candidates, as has been reported, not like each other?"" King asked. ""I can only speak for Barack, and I know that Barack has the utmost respect for Sen. McCain. He said so on so many occasions,"" she said.  ""I think this has been a long, tough fight. And politics sometimes leads to things said between the candidates. But again, what we found is that people are really focused on who is going to -- who has got the vision that's going to take us to the next level?"" She said campaigning is exhausting but she likes it more than she expected. ""When I'm tired, I get more energy coming out of a rally where I get the -- get hugs and I see people on the rope lines tearing up because they never thought they'd see this moment,"" she said. ""I see kids who are focused and engaged in a way that I've never seen before. That gives us both energy."" Obama also talked about Sen. Hillary Clinton. ""Are you happy with the way she's supporting your husband?"" King asked. ""She has been phenomenal. ...She has always been just cordial and open. I've called her, I've talked to her. She's given me advice about the kids,"" Obama said.  Watch Michelle Obama call Hillary Clinton 'phenomenal' » . ""We've talked at length about this kind of stuff -- how you feel, how you react. She has been amazing. She is a real pro and a woman with character.""

"(CNN)  -- It was to be a somber memorial, a remembrance of those who perished in a lethal milky fog. To mark the 25th anniversary of the world's worst industrial disaster, authorities planned to open up the now-dilapidated shell of the Union Carbide fertilizer plant, where in the wee hours of December 3, 1984, 40 tons of methyl isocyanate gas oozed out onto the sleeping city of Bhopal, India. About 4,000 people died instantly in the toxic leak, an event that came to be marked each year with disputes over victims' rights and government accountability. On this year's milestone anniversary, a new controversy has stirred. The state government of Madhya Pradesh planned to temporarily open the long-silent plant -- surrounded by concrete barriers and barbed wire -- to the public. It was to be part of a series of events observing the tragedy. Because everyone wanted to see, to know. For the same reason that a person visits a Nazi concentration camp or ground zero in New York. ""Everyone wants to see the world's worst industrial disaster,"" said S.R. Mohanty, the secretary for the Relief and Rehabilitation Department for the Bhopal gas tragedy. It was going to be the government's way of reassuring its people that the plant no longer posed a threat to society. But the move sparked protests from victim rights groups and environmental activists. Just days before the anniversary, government officials backed away from the plan they had recently announced. The official reason, however, had little to do with the gas leak. Mohanty cited an election rule currently in force that prohibits acts that could be construed as attempting to influence voters ahead of the polls. Bhopal's municipal elections are scheduled for December. The plant could still be opened at a later date. Though officials representing the government of the state of Madhya Pradesh maintained the Union Carbide plant is perfectly safe, their plans drew criticism. Activists who advocate for Bhopal's victims viewed the plant tours as a publicity stunt for the government. It was another way to shirk responsibility, said Rachna Dhingra, an activist with the Bhopal Group for Information & Action, a coalition of agencies that advocates for victims. ""They knew about the elections a month ago,"" Dhingra said, noting that on the 25th anniversary the government wanted to divert attention from the real issues. Thousands of people still suffer from exposure to the deadly gas and from land and water that became contaminated. Activists contend that neither Union Carbide nor the Indian government has done enough to help survivors. In the years since the poison cloud enclosed Bhopal, thousands more have died of contamination-related illnesses. The International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal alleges that survivors have received an average of only $500 each in compensation. Those who are drinking contaminated water or children who were born with birth defects have not received any money, the coalition said. Union Carbide, which was bought by The Dow Chemical Co. in 1999, has said it has no liability left in the disaster after it paid the Indian government a $470 million out-of-court settlement in 1989. The company has said it believes the leak was an act of sabotage. Dhingra said plans to open the plant to the public was disrespectful to Bhopal's gas victims. The government, she said, was eager to showcase the city as a shining example of recovery.","State had planned to temporarily open the plant to the public .

"London (CNN) -- A 26-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the weekend vandalism of a painting by famed artist Mark Rothko at a London museum, London's Metropolitan Police announced late Monday. The man was arrested in Worthing, on the southern coast of England, and will be brought to London on suspicion of criminal damage, a police statement said. The man was not named. The painting -- part of Rothko's Seagram mural series -- was hanging at London's Tate Modern museum when a man began tagging the canvas with black paint Sunday afternoon. Museum-goer Tim Wright, who witnessed the defacement and posted an image of it on Twitter, told CNN he noticed a man walk into the exhibit and thought nothing of it until he heard a ""smashing sound."" ""It was very surreal. It wasn't something we expected to see. One minute he sat down, and the next minute he put his foot over the barrier,"" Wright said. He said he and his girlfriend saw the man as he finished up the tag and then made his getaway. They stayed at the exhibit while a group of nearby women went to find museum staff. An alarm soon went off, and the museum was evacuated. Wright said he and his girlfriend gave a description of the event to a museum employee. ""It's just not the thing you expect to see in an art gallery,"" Wright said. ""I've never seen anything like it. It's quite shocking, actually."" Rothko, a Russian-American abstract expressionist, was commissioned to do a series of paintings for the Four Seasons restaurant of the Seagram building in New York in 1958. Though he started the series of murals, he famously reneged, deciding the swanky New York restaurant wasn't an appropriate home for his art. Rothko rejected the commission but completed paintings stemming from the project, many of which made their way into the halls of museums. The murals arrived in London as Rothko killed himself in 1970 and have been on display at many of the Tate's locations, as well as the National Gallery of Art in Washington. Rothko's children, Kate Rothko Prizel and Christopher Rothko, said in a statement that they were thankful for the support of others after the incident. ""The Rothko family is greatly troubled by yesterday's occurrence but has full confidence that the Tate Gallery will do all in its power to remedy the situation,"" the family said. ""Our father donated his legendary Seagram paintings to the museum in 1969 sensing the commitment of the institution to his work and impressed by the warm embrace it had received from the British public. We are heartened to have felt that embrace again in the outpouring of distress and support that we and our father have received both directly and in public forums.""

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A controversial -- and potentially pivotal -- call in a one-game playoff Friday night between the Atlanta Braves and St. Louis Cardinals prompted a vehement argument by the Braves' manager and fans to toss debris onto the field. The incident occurred in the eighth inning of the newly introduced wild card baseball postseason game, in which the two teams battled for the right to advance to a National League division series. At the time, St. Louis led Atlanta by a 6-3 score. With one out and runners on first and second base, Braves shortstop Andrelton Simmons skied a pop-up to shallow left field. Amid apparent confusion between two Cardinals' players, the ball dropped -- which could have led to the Braves loading the bases. But instead, an umpire ruled Simmons out, citing the infield fly rule. The rule is traditionally invoked on pop flies in the infield, in order to prevent fielders from letting a ball drop -- in order to get two outs instead of one, had they caught the ball. SI: What is the infield fly rule? Atlanta manager Fredi Gonzalez stormed out of the dugout to protest the call, while angry fans pelted the field with cups, bottles and other debris. After an 18-minute delay, play finally resumed -- with the umpires ruling the call still valid, and the Braves then playing the game under protest. Braves' pinch-hitter Brian McCann then walked before the Cardinals' Jason Motte struck out Michael Bourn to end the inning. After two quick outs in the ninth inning, Atlanta's Chipper Jones -- the team's legendary third baseman who has announced this is his last season -- got on base with an infield hit. Freddie Freeman then rocketed a ground rule double, bringing the tying run to the plate in the form of Dan Uggla. Yet the second baseman ended the game -- and the Braves' season and, with it, Jones' career -- by grounding out to second base. Matthew Bolus, a 19-year-old lifelong Braves fan who had driven all the way from Birmingham, Alabama, for the game, was among those fans who felt cheated by the call. ""I feel like I didn't see the game that I was supposed to see,"" he said. Atlanta fans responded to the final out with more boos, as well as a smattering of more debris flying onto the field. The disgust was interrupted only by a chant of ""Chipper,"" recognizing the end of the fan favorite Jones' career. Chipper Jones' last hurrah . Joe Torre, a former player and manager who is now Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations for Major League Baseball, told reporters later that he talked with umpire crew chief Jeff Kellogg during the long delay. After the game concluded, Torre talked to Gonzalez and Braves General Manager Frank Wren about their protest. During the regular season, teams have 24 hours to file a written protest, after which baseball executives can make a judgment. But Torre said that timetable ""just didn't make sense"" with the game's victors advancing to the next round of the playoffs starting Sunday, so he decided the matter immediately. ""I spoke to them and asked them what (grounds) they were making the protest on,"" Torre said. ""And I ruled, basically, to disallow the protest based on the fact that it's an umpire's judgment call."" When asked after the game if he doubted whether he made the right call after the boos and debris started raining down, umpire Sam Holbrook said succinctly, ""Absolutely not."" With the 6-3 victory, St. Louis advances to play the National League East champion Washington Nationals in the next round of the playoffs. The San Francisco Giants face off against the Cincinnati Reds in the league's other postseason series. Baseball season's final day brings drama . Following the game, Gonzalez criticized what he deemed ""a bad call,"" saying the ball was too far out in the outfield to warrant the infield fly rule. Still, he said he was ""a little disappointed"" with fans who threw objects on the field and pointed out how the Braves' three errors and inability to drive in more runs also contributed to the loss. ""Anybody can have one bad game, anybody can have one bad call go against you,"" the Atlanta manager said. ""It hurts losing ballgames like we did tonight."" Torre acknowledged some may understandably disagree with the eighth-inning call. Yet he pointed out that mistakes -- including errors by fielders and strikeouts by hitters -- have been part of baseball for as long as the sport has been around. ""I think controversy is part of what we do, because the game is not perfect,"" Torre said. ""That's always been the game."" The American League one-game playoff match between the Baltimore Orioles and the Texas Rangers did not have the controversy or trash throwing. Baltimore won the game 5-1, continuing the miracle season the team is having. The Orioles will move on to play the New York Yankees on Sunday. One-handed kid meets Chipper Jones .

"(CNN) -- Train wrecks are intrinsically spectacular, and Will Smith's new movie offers a doozy. Two of them, in fact. Jason Bateman and Will Smith star in ""Hancock."" In the first, Jason Bateman's genial public relations guy Ray is sitting in his car, snarled in traffic and oblivious to the locomotive bearing down on him until it's almost too late. Fortunately for Ray, John Hancock (Smith) is on the case. Using his Superman-like powers, Hancock flips Ray's car up and over in a neat backward somersault, safely out of harm's way. At the same time he thrusts out his arm and stops the train in its tracks. While Ray is grateful, the guy in the car underneath his isn't so sure -- and the damage to the derailed train stretches back a half-mile or more. That's the train wreck within the movie. The train wreck that is the movie is even more interesting. We all know that Will Smith ""owns"" the July 4 weekend -- so much so, there aren't any other big openings this week (aside from the small-scale ""Kit Kittredge: An American Girl,"" which began in limited release last week). Since ""Independence Day"" he's virtually become synonymous with Big Summer Fun. And he makes it look so easy, too. ""Hancock"" tinkers with that self-confidence a little bit. Apparently immortal and impervious to pain, Hancock fulfills the superhero's brief -- he safeguards the citizenry of Los Angeles -- but he's sunk well below complacency into an alcoholic stew of resentment and contempt for his public. When a young fan stirs him from a drunken stupor to chase some bad guys in the movie's opening scene, Hancock sends him off with an insult: ""What do you want, a cookie?"" Later, he picks up an obnoxious kid who has pushed his luck too far and flings him into the stratosphere, catching him 30 seconds later with obvious reluctance. In short, this is not the agreeable Will Smith we know and love, and even in this summer of edgier, angrier action heroes (see also ""Iron Man"" and ""The Incredible Hulk""), Hancock may be the first full-blown jerk to front a blockbuster. iReport.com: Share your review of ""Hancock"" But before you jump to conclusions, this is not the problem with the movie. Though the cynical, adult edge to the comedy may limit the film's audience (it is rated PG-13) it also qualifies as a welcome change. Hancock's reckless heroism -- and the wreckage he leaves in his wake -- inspires the film's funniest stuff (which is why you've probably seen it all in the trailers). Cussing, pulling on a bottle of booze as he chases down bad guys and dressing like a wino, Smith has fun playing against type, and in possibly his best big-screen performance yet, Jason Bateman makes an engaging comic foil. Like ""Incredibles"" patriarch Mr. Incredible before him, Hancock has alienated the authorities with his DIY approach to problem-solving. They even issue a warrant for his arrest. Ray -- who owes the guy his life and has invited him into his home to meet the wife (Charlize Theron) -- encourages Hancock to surrender himself, serve some time, address his alcohol and anger-management issues, and wait for soaring crime statistics to pave his early release. It's when this scenario plays out that Peter Berg's movie jumps the tracks. Writers Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan have concocted an outrageous, mind-boggling twist that comes so far out of left field you would need a crystal ball to see it coming. No spoilers here, but it doesn't work, not in the short term and not in the big picture either. It's as if we've been whisked from one kind of movie -- a brisk, superficial but entertaining high-concept comedy -- and into the theater next door, where they're showing some sort of tragic ""X-Men"" knockoff. The last half-hour of this 92-minute movie is a fiasco. Berg's shaky-cam technique doesn't help, nor does a weak, inadequate villain (played by Eddie Marsan). Still, it's rare -- and startling -- to see a big-budget movie fall apart so dramatically. Whether it was inspired by ego or economics, more than anything the turnaround feels like a colossal collective failure of nerve. ""Hancock"" will likely post strong long weekend figures, but just watch those numbers plummet as the word gets out. A superhero can overcome many things, but not a movie that goes off the rails.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- For the first time in almost two weeks, the name of presumptive Chinese leader Xi Jinping has appeared in state media, but it wasn't to dampen speculation about his ""disappearance"" weeks before a major Communist Party congress. Instead, the 59-year-old vice president's name appeared on a message of condolence following the death on September 6 of a former official in Guangxi Province. ""After the passing of Comrade Huang Rong, Hu Jintao, Xi Jinping, Li Yuanchao, Zhu Rongji and Li Zhaozhuo expressed their condolences and conveyed their deep sympathies to his family,"" it said. Xi's name appeared second on the list after current President Hu, and before other leaders including Li Yuanchao, head of the powerful Organization department who, like Xi, is tipped for a place on the Politburo Standing Committee, the nine-member team who leads China. Jockeying for position ahead of China's leadership jamboree . The message did not include any direct quotes from Xi, and its existence doesn't provide any explanation as to why Xi has dropped from public view. The vice president has not been seen in public since September 1 when he was reported to have given a speech to the Central Party School in Beijing. Images published by major news websites after the date showed Xi looking well and smartly dressed in a dark suit and purple tie. However, since then, the cancellation of a number of meetings with high-profile foreign dignitaries has created a storm of speculation as rumor and hearsay fill the void of official information. Who are the next generation of Chinese leaders? For a number of days, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, has declined to answer queries on Xi at the Ministry's daily press briefings. When Xi's meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton was abruptly canceled on September 5, American officials said their Chinese counterparts had blamed a ""scheduling conflict."" No official reasons were given following the cancellation of other appointments, including a meeting with Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. The lack of comment has fueled unsubstantiated rumors, including wild plot lines ranging from a car crash, to an assassination attempt. Others say Xi has been sidelined by a suspected heart attack or stroke, neither of which have been denied or confirmed. It is not unknown for Chinese leaders to suffer serious illnesses in secret. In April 1993, Li Peng, the then premier, disappeared for six weeks after a heart attack. The foreign ministry said he had ""a cold"" and confirmation that he had been treated in hospital did not come until this July. ""In most countries including in Asia, people are entitled to know the health of their leaders, but in China this is still regarded as state secrets,"" Willy Lam, a longtime China watcher who teaches politics and history at universities in Hong Kong and Japan, told CNN Monday. During Xi's absence, other Chinese leaders have made a number of high-profile appearances outside China. Hu has addressed APEC delegates in Vladivostok, Russia and China's top legislator, Wu Bangguo, met with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Tehran. China expert Linda Jakobsen, of the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Australia, says that the mere presence of a high-ranking official on foreign trips indicates that China's leadership is not dealing with a crisis. ""If Xi was gravely ill or had encountered political problems, which would call into question his anointment as head of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) at the upcoming Party Congress, senior leaders would not be traveling and the leadership would be convening in Beijing. That is standard CCP practice at a time of crisis,"" she wrote in a recent column. In a matter of weeks, more than 2,000 delegates are expected to meet in Beijing for the Communist Party's 18th National Congress. During their event, China's political elite are expected to announce the results of months of political maneuvering, and the names of the five to seven new entrants to Politburo Standing Committee. ""The Chinese leadership is worried about social stability,"" said David Zweig, a seasoned China observer and a professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. ""But nothing creates greater social instability than this kind of lack of information about the leadership."" Already, China's leadership transition has been marred by extraordinary twists and turns. In April, Bo Xilai, once considered to be among party royalty and a fast-rising star within the party, was stripped of his leadership positions for an unspecified ""breach of party discipline."" He has not been seen publicly since. Disgraced Party chief looms large over China's leadership . Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, was convicted last month of murdering Neil Heywood, a British businessman, and received a suspended death sentence. And Bo's former police chief, Wang Lijun, whose attempt in February to seek asylum in a U.S. Consulate triggered the scandal, was charged last week with defection and bribe-taking. Wang is awaiting trial. Although most analysts agree the all-important 18th Communist Party Congress will be held in the middle of next month, though authorities have yet to confirm the date. ""More questions are now being asked about the transparency of Chinese politics since everything is in a black box,"" said Lam. Observers say the official silence could also signal last-minute negotiations among senior political figures before they present a facade of unity to the public. The current generation of leaders has been particularly sensitive to maintaining a united front since 1989, when the party hierarchy split over how to deal with pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. ""Xi Jinping is already projected to be a weak leader because he doesn't have a power base of his own,"" said Lam, who predicted Hu will remain the head of the Chinese military for two to three years after relinquishing his party and state titles to Xi. ""Hu could be the ultimate winner here -- he will be the power behind the throne.""","Chinese media mentions Xi Jinping in statement of condolence .

"(CNN) -- Take it from President Barack Obama -- Virginia's Loudoun County is a must-win swing district in a must-win swing state. ""We won last time in Loudoun County, and if we win again, we win Virginia,"" Obama declared at a rally in August. ""And if we win Virginia, we win the election."" The final factor affecting many undecided voters in this wealthy Washington exurb is sequestration -- massive, automatic cuts scheduled to start taking effect at the the beginning of 2013 after the failure of a supercommittee to come up with a deficit-reduction plan. Loudoun County is emblematic of the new northern Virginia -- upper-middle class, fast-growing and increasingly diverse. Over the past decade, the landscape has transformed from quiet farmland to rows of upper middle-class houses. As defense budgets boomed under President George W. Bush post-9/11, the industry expanded, and many new defense workers and contractors moved to Loudoun. The county now has the highest median household income in the United States -- $119,000 a year. Population doubled over the past decade, to 312,000 -- and the Hispanic population has tripled. This isn't old Virginia; it's new Virginia. And these demographic factors helped Obama become the first Democrat to win the state since Lyndon Johnson in 1964 -- by a margin in Loudoun County of just 11,509 votes. Four years later, the unemployment rate in Loudoun County is strikingly low -- just 4% -- about half the national average. But these looming automatic cuts are creating a clear and present danger to Loudoun's economic well-being that is resonating here. News: Energized Obama touts new jobs report in Virginia, Ohio . So sequestration weighs heavily on the minds of undecided Loudoun County voters such as John Dyer, co-founder of a 2-year-old small business -- KSH Tech Solutions -- that specializes in consulting to government agencies to increase efficiency. Dyer is a coveted swing voter whose votes in the past reflect the winner of Virginia -- the voter that both campaigns are trying to reach in this final stretch. He's a native Virginian, raised in Richmond, and he cast his first ballot for Ronald Reagan. The first Democrat he ever voted for was Obama. Four years later, he's concerned that Obama's run out of energy and the overall economy still hasn't improved as fast as he'd hoped. He understands that the deficit needs to be dealt with but believes that abrupt sequester-style cuts could be devastating to the local and national economy. He'll be watching the next debates with these priorities in mind: ""I feel passionate about health care, that's for sure. And the issues around the federal government spending, the DOD (Department of Defense), and how it affects our business. It is my lifeblood and my future."" There's no question that the specter of sequestration has cast a chill in this community. ""My neighborhood is full of subcontractors and contractors that work for or in the federal government,"" Dyer says. ""Some have already talked to their employees -- they have given notice that a storm could be coming, and they need to be prepared for layoffs."" Dyer's business partner is Katie Hammler, a former captain in the U.S. Army Reserves, an independent voter who also serves on the Leesburg Town Council . ""This is going to be as serious a problem to our north Virginia region as the fallout of the car industry was to Detroit,"" Hammler says. ""It will be small businesses like ours that are going to be hit the most. Two million jobs will be lost, half of which will be from small companies. We'll be hit earliest and hardest."" Hammler blames sequestration on congressional division and dysfunction: ""It's as if there are certain factions within the parties who are setting things up where because of the pressure of the next primary, because of the pressure of the election, there's no incentive for compromise and collaboration to find meaningful solutions to complex problems."" There's plenty of blame to go around for both parties, but Hammler expresses special frustration with a particular group: ""Those who oppose Obama have done everything in their power to ensure that he fails."" With sequestration as a final factor in this key swing county of Virginia, the tea party rhetoric of 2010 won't necessarily work on undecided swing voters such as Dyer. ""People support the government here,"" he says. ""They work for the mission of the government. Even as a contractor, you work to fulfill that mission."" News: With Ryan by his side, Romney rallies Virginians in debate victory lap . Virginians have a contrarian streak -- in recent decades they have voted for a governor from the opposite party as the president just elected. ""Virginians are wary of too much government power in one party,"" says Leesburg Mayor Kristen Umstattd. ""They like the balance of power."" But while both parties might be to blame for the failed supercommittee resulting in the scheduled sequestration cuts, they can vote for only one president. The demographic changes in Virginia and comparatively strong economy might give Obama reason to believe that he can make history a second time by winning Virginia, but it is far from a sure thing in this traditionally conservative corner of the country. To convince Dyer and other undecided swing voters in Loudoun County, the two candidates will need to present a balanced plan to avoid the blunt edge of sequestration cuts and a practical strategy for avoiding this kind of high-risk, hyper-partisan brinksmanship in the future. That's a final factor in winning this key swing district of this key swing state in the fight for the White House 2012. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion.

The 67-year-old grandmother of two said dwelling on her incarceration, and longing for her family, was disheartening ""so that's why I plunged into exercising, and I wrote a book in my mind on the history and life story of my grandmother. As I would be walking, I would write chapters and edit them in my mind and rewrite it the next day.""  Watch an 'elated' Esfandiari explain how she passed the time » . Esfandiari said she was treated ""with respect"" while at Evin, but added, ""A prison is a prison."" Esfandiari was allowed to go home last week. She returned to Potomac, Maryland, on Thursday and discussed her arrest and captivity during a Saturday interview. Though she said she's unsure why she was jailed in Evin's political wing, Esfandiari believes her Iranian captors wanted to know more about the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars, the Washington-based think tank where she heads the Middle East program. ""I think they were trying to found out more about the Wilson Center -- what it really does, were trying to find out about think tanks in America, foundations in America, the relationship between think tanks, foundations and the government,"" she said. On December 21, the dual Iranian-American national traveled to Iran to visit her 93-year-old mother, where she visited for nine days. On December 30, she caught a taxi to the airport where she planned to fly home to Washington. Those plans were altered by three knife-wielding men who stopped her cab, threatened to kill her and stole her luggage and handbag, which contained both of her passports and her airline ticket. Esfandiari called her husband, Shaul Bakhash, back home in Maryland and told him to cancel her credit cards and report the stolen passport. The next day, she went to the authorities. ""I went to the passport office, and they said that they would like to, somebody wants to talk to you. And that was the beginning of the saga,"" she said. That somebody, according to the Wilson Center, was an official with Iran's Ministry of Intelligence. Beginning on January 4, Esfandiari was subjected to weeks of interrogations, sometimes as many as four a week and some lasting as long as eight hours, according to the Wilson Center. The questioning, the center said, was ""unpleasant and not free from intimidation and threat."" She was pressured to make confessions and falsely implicate the Wilson Center. She once received a threatening phone call. On January 18, she awoke from a nap at her mother's home to find her interrogator and two men -- one of them wielding a video camera -- staring into her bedroom, the Wilson Center said. On February 17, the interrogations stopped, but in late April or early May she again began receiving phone calls from the Iranian government. On May 7, she was asked to go to the Ministry of Intelligence the following morning, according to the Wilson Center. When she arrived, she was put in a car and taken to Evin prison. Over the next two weeks, Iranian media reported that Esfandiari was accused of trying to topple the Iranian government. Later that month, a judiciary spokesperson announced that she was charged with espionage, actions against national security and propaganda against the Islamic republic. ""It was puzzling for me at first,"" Esfandiari told CNN. ""I think there is a concern among certain elements that the United States has planned some kind of Velvet Revolution in Iran, and since they are bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan, they won't do it through military. They would do [it] through think tanks and foundations to create a network of people to undermine the regime. I think that is their concern."" The Velvet Revolution is the name given to the 1989 bloodless coup that saw Czechoslovakia's communist regime overthrown. In prison, Esfandiari was interviewed for an Iranian state television documentary, in which she allegedly linked U.S. think tanks and nongovernmental organizations with a ""soft revolution"" against the Iranian government. The Wilson Center quickly denounced the documentary as ""scripted, contrived, and completely without merit."" The center's president and director, Lee Hamilton, who has served on the 9/11 Commission and Iraq Study Group, also issued a statement, saying the documentary took ""the fabrication of news to a new art form. This is shameful. It cannot be considered a 'confession' by any stretch of the imagination."" Hamilton had written letters to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Majlis Speaker Shouray-e-Islami, to no avail. On June 29, he wrote another letter to Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, pleading for his help in Esfandiari's case. A week later, the former congressman met in New York with Iran's representative to the U.N., who delivered a written response from Khamenei. The letter, which ""was positive and conveyed respect,"" marked the first time the ayatollah had responded to an American leader, according to the Wilson Center. Esfandiari said she believes she owes her freedom, in part, to Hamilton's letter. The Iranian government never said why Esfandiari was allowed to go home, but on August 21 she was released on a bail of 3 billion Iranian rials ($320,000). Esfandiari picked up her passport September 1 and flew to Vienna, Austria, where her sister lives, the next day. She arrived in the United States on Thursday. ""The first thing I did, I walked around, walked into the kitchen and started looking at things and say, 'OK, where is this? This shouldn't be here! That shouldn't be there!' "" she said. ""And Shaul goes, 'There she goes again.' "" Esfandiari said she is ""elated to be home."" ""Sleeping in my own bed after eight months, taking a shower in my own bathroom after eight months, walking around the garden,"" she said. ""To see my grandchildren who have grown since I last saw them in those eight months. So it is a fantastic -- it is a fantastic feeling -- and looking back, I am glad this nightmare is over.""

Brooklyn, New York (Motherboard.tv) -- In April of last year the Deepwater Horizon semi-submersible Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit exploded in the Gulf of Mexico, killing 11 men, injuring 17 others and triggering what is generally recognized as one of the greatest human errors ever made and officially the largest unforeseen marine oil catastrophe since people started drilling for oil. By the time the leak was capped in July 2010, enough oil to fill 4.9 million barrels covered the Gulf in a toxic slick. See the rest of ""Sailing Drone"" at Motherboard.tv. Enter Cesar Harada. After visiting the oil spill in June 2010, the young engineer decided to leave MIT in Boston to develop an open source oil spill cleaning robot, Protei. Our current array of oil spill skimming technologies â€” mostly private boats retrofitted with skimming equipment and skimmers maintained by the U.S. Coast Guard â€” are only able to collect three percent of the oil in the Gulf of Mexico and carry health risks to humans and heavy economic costs. Protei is unmanned, autonomous, relatively inexpensive and open hardware (anybody can use, modify and distribute its designs), making it a potentially powerful weapon in the battle to clean up the Gulf of Mexico while preserving the safety of the workers who would otherwise be exposed to the toxic mess. Already Harada imagines other uses for the sailboat drone, like oceanography and surveillance. In the first episode of our ""Upgrade"" series, Motherboard goes to Rotterdam to watch Harada's ragtag team of scientists and engineers as they hustle to assemble the first Protei prototype and dodge the Dutch harbor patrol for their first water test.","Engineer develops robotic sailboat to clean up oil spills .

"(CNN) -- Police in southern California have arrested the husband of a slain Iraqi woman -- whose death authorities first thought could have been a hate crime -- on suspicion of her murder. Shaima Alawadi, 32, died from her injuries in March after she was brutally beaten at her home. A note beside the body told the family to go back to Iraq and called them ""terrorists,"" her daughter said. At the time, authorities did not rule out the possibility her death could have been a hate crime, though they said then they were examining other possibilities as well. ""After months of hard work by El Cajon Police Department detectives, we determined that this homicide was the result of domestic violence and not the result of a hate crime,"" said city Police Chief Jim Redman. Alawadi's husband, Kassim Al-Himidi, was arrested Thursday and booked at the San Diego Central Jail on suspicion of murder, he said. According to authorities, Al-Himidi, 48, is being held without bail and is scheduled to appear in court Tuesday for an arraignment. It was not immediately clear whether he had retained an attorney. His wife's death drew international attention. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki provided a plane that flew Alawadi's body back to Iraq, where the mother of five was buried. Dozens of people attended the funeral, including her husband. Alawadi and Al-Himidi moved to the San Diego County area in 1995 and then briefly lived in Dearborn, Michigan, before moving back to California. El Cajon, where the family lived, and Dearborn have sizable Iraqi communities -- among the nation's largest. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland called the attack on Alawadi an ""absolutely brutal beating."" She said in March that ""authorities are continuing to search for motives behind this attack, but the United States has no tolerance for wanton acts of violence like this.""","Kassim Al-Himidi is in custody on suspicion of murdering his Iraqi wife .

"(CNN) -- Between the presidential candidates and congressional races, at least $4.2 billion may have been spent on an election that ultimately ended up preserving the status quo in Washington. Voters elected the same president and the same political parties -- the Republicans in the House and the Democrats in the Senate -- will run Congress. Did all that record spending really matter? At the presidential level, maybe not so much. Partial totals of what was spent so far show that between the candidate, his party and well-heeled outside groups, the ""Red Team"" spent more money on the effort to elect Republican Mitt Romney than the ""Blue Team"" did to re-elect President Barack Obama, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that monitors the influence of money on politics. Combined, the candidate, the national party, and outside spending groups, like conservative issue-oriented nonprofits and super PACs, had spent more than $1 billion on Romney's effort. The liberal version of that combination of groups spent about $96 million less on the Obama re-election. That number will change once the final accounting is completed. There was a ton of last-minute spending on attack ads and get-out-the-vote efforts. However, the Obama campaign raised almost twice as much as the Romney camp. Business group blows $29 million on election losers . ""I'd be surprised if he left anything in the bank,"" said Bill Allison, editorial director at the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan nonprofit that advocates for greater government transparency. No matter who spent more, Allison worries that the amount of money involved in this election will dramatically change politics. ""I think the most worrisome thing is that this is the first billion dollar-plus presidential campaign, so what this means is this amount will become the benchmark,"" Allison said. ""If you want to be a serious contender in the future, you will have to have those kind of resources and it gives an outsized role then to the outside groups who are able to raise unlimited funds."" Difference seen in congressional races . Allison believes money may have made the most difference in congressional races. It seemed to have played a particularly big role when interests outside of a candidate's state got involved. The Center for Responsive Politics estimates that outside groups spent some $1.3 billion and counting on the election. In 2008, they only spent $262.7 million. The difference this time was mainly due to a landmark court ruling two years ago that effectively permitted a sharp increase in outside spending, especially by corporations and unions. ""At the presidential level, candidates are able to raise enough money to get their message out and drive their own narrative,"" Allison said. ""Down the ballot though, where you've got outside groups dumping $500,000 into a race and the opposition doesn't have the cash on hand to compete, that could make a real difference."" In a CNN analysis of spending in a dozen key Senate races, most of the candidates who won spent the most money. One Senate race that saw record amounts of outside money was in Wisconsin. Senator Herb Kohl, a Democrat who had held his seat since 1989, decided to retire this year. Both candidates who ran for his seat had strong name recognition in Wisconsin. American Crossroads defends campaign spending to donors . Democrat Tammy Baldwin served seven terms in the U.S. House. She is well known nationally as the first publicly-out lesbian to be elected to federal office. Her Republican opponent, Tommy Thompson, was a popular Wisconsin governor before becoming Health Secretary in the administration of George W. Bush. After winning a bruising Republican primary, Thompson was seen as an early favorite -- partly because Wisconsin has recently leaned much more 'red.' In August, Thompson had a nine-point lead in the polls, but Baldwin had fully turned the tables by the end of September. Thompson rallied and by Election Day, the race was too close to call. The primary had left Thompson cash poor while Baldwin was able to outpace him in fundraising. She spent virtually all of it -- $11.6 million -- as of the October reporting deadline. Thompson raised $7.36 million and spent $6.04 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Outside groups, super PACs spent more . Outside groups spent even more on the race than did the campaigns. Super PACs and special interest groups spent some $18.9 million on efforts opposing Thompson and only $2.6 million in support of him. The groups spent $15.5 million against Baldwin, $1.2 million for her. The biggest outside group that tried to hurt Baldwin's chances created a slew of negative ads. In them, Republican operative Karl Rove's group, Crossroads GPS, called Baldwin a ""rubber stamp"" for the president, who was ""too extreme"" for the state. Crossroads GPS spent more than $6 million on this race, but lost. ""You have to keep in mind though candidates don't win elections just because they spend more,"" Allison said. ""A win is also based on how effectively a candidate spends their money and on just how effective a campaigner the candidate is."" Analysis: It's never too early to talk about 2016 . In the Senate race in Indiana, for instance, Republican Richard Mourdock outspent Democratic opponent Joe Donnelley by about $7 million. But Mourdock lost. Mourdock ran a strong race, but took a hit in the polls when, at a debate, he made a controversial remark about rape and abortion. In Wisconsin, Thompson's campaign also hit a few bumps along the way. A low point may have been when Thompson's son told an audience, ""We have the opportunity to send President Obama back to Chicago, or Kenya."" He later apologized for the remarks. While the race remained tight throughout election night, Baldwin defeated Thompson 51% to 46%. Baldwin will become the first female Senator to represent Wisconsin and the nation's first openly gay person to win a Senate seat. ""I didn't run to make history,"" Baldwin said in her acceptance speech. ""I ran to make a difference."" It looks like the money she spent on the race may have made a difference, too.","At least $4.2 billion spent in 2012 election .

"(CNN) -- The International Olympic Committee has stripped American cyclist Tyler Hamilton of his 2004 gold due to doping and ordered him to return the medal that he won in the Athens Olympics. ""Hamilton, 41, who finished first in the men's individual time trial and 18th in the men's road race at Athens 2004, was disqualified from those events after he admitted to having used performance-enhancing drugs in advance of the Games,"" the IOC said in a press release Friday. The IOC also ruled that the riders who finished behind Hamilton in the individual time trial in Athens will now be moved up in placement. That means Russian Ekimov Viatcheslav Ekimov will now get the gold medal, and American cyclist Bobby Julich will get the silver. Michael Rogers of Australia, who finished fourth, will now get the bronze. Hamilton made headlines last year when he accused fellow American cyclist Lance Armstrong of doping.

"HUNTINGTON, Utah (CNN)  -- Rescuers trying to find six miners will begin boring a sixth hole down into Utah's Crandall Canyon mine Friday, and the search will stop if no signs of life are found, the coal mine's co-owner said. Bob Murray, CEO of Murray Energy Corp., says he is hurt by criticism he did not do enough to find the miners. ""This is the last hole,"" Bob Murray, CEO of Murray Energy, said Wednesday evening. ""If we don't find anybody alive in that hole, there's nowhere else that anyone ... would know where to drill."" Murray said work on the sixth hole, which will go down into the area where the miners were known to be working when the mine collapsed August 6, should be completed by Saturday. However, he expressed little optimism that the effort would be successful, saying it was ""totally unlikely"" any signs of the miners will be found. Murray also said that he has already filed paperwork with federal regulators to permanently close and seal the Utah mine. ""I will never come back to that evil mountain,"" he said. Earlier Wednesday, a fifth hole drilled down into the mine found just six inches of open space left between the roof and rubble in an 8-foot-high tunnel, said Jack Kuzar, a district manager with the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration. Kuzar said the fifth hole would be tested for oxygen, and a camera may be lowered down the shaft, although the small amount of space may limit its usefulness. Cameras lowered into previous holes drilled into the mountain turned up no signs of the miners, and tests showed that oxygen levels in parts of the mine were too low to sustain human life.  Watch how the safety record at Murray's mines stacks up » . An effort to send rescuers through the collapsed mine tunnel to attempt an underground rescue was suspended last week, after a new cave-in killed three rescuers and injured six others. A panel of experts brought in to examine the mine after the second collapse determined that it was too unstable to resume the underground rescue. Both the mine owners and federal officials also ruled out trying to find the miners by lowering rescuers in a capsule through a hole drilled down into the mine, saying the dangerous maneuver wasn't justified absent any signs of life. The news was a blow to the family members of the missing miners, who have been holding out hope for a miracle and criticized Murray for not at least trying the rescue capsule. Signs reading ""Bring them home"" and ""Bob Murray keep your promise"" were posted overnight at the rescuers' command post. Kuzar said he met with the miners' families Wednesday, ""and they're holding up very well."" ""They're very strong people,"" he said. Earlier Wednesday, in an interview with CNN, Murray said plans were under way to establish a memorial for the missing miners at the site after the mine is closed. ""We're already discussing how we might go about to honor the trapped miners and make this a site for perpetuity,"" he said. Friends and family have identified the six missing miners as Luis Hernandez, Manuel Sanchez, Kerry Allred, Carlos Payan, Brandon Phillips and Don Erickson.

"(CNN) -- My grandfather Jacques Yves Cousteau shared with me many stories about the United Nations Earth Summit in 1992 and the sense of hope that surrounded it. I have kept a copy of the speech he made there on June 5th outlining his concerns for the future of humankind. The insight it provides now, on the eve of the 20th anniversary of that historic event, is particularly poignant. Chief amongst those concerns was the issue of population, and how it directly relates to women and education. To be clear, my grandfather was not a proponent of draconian policies restricting birth rates or depriving people of their right to have children. While growing up, I heard his constant refrain that the key to solving the population crisis is to empower women. As he pointed out in his 1992 speech: ""In all the countries with an excessive birth rate, women are segregated, deprived of appropriate health care; the rate of illiteracy among women is one-third higher than for men."" My grandfather believed that when women are empowered socially, economically and given access to family planning and general education, the birth rate drops. He was not alone; the rise of the micro-credit movement and the success of organizations such as the Grameen Bank have radically changed the way a woman's role is viewed in communities around the world. See also: Can Rio +20 solve the world's environmental problems? As Abulkalam Abdul Momen, Vice-President of the United Nations Economic and Social Council pointed out during a 2011 meeting of the Council: ""Educated women are better able to plan their families and are more aware of employment, schooling and health opportunities for themselves and their children. On a wider level, fewer children in a society mean that more resources are available to every individual child."" Why do Jacques Cousteau's words continue to resonate today? Since 1992, the global population has increased from 5.6 billion people to approximately 7 billion in 2012, and is expected to balloon to 9.5 billion by 2050. Like too many people packed into a vault with an ever-dwindling oxygen supply, this drastic growth still presents unprecedented problems for the global community as we continue to consume natural resources and emit pollution at a staggering rate. For example, just to keep pace with current population growth, it is estimated that food production will have to increase 70% by 2050. The lack of access to clean, potable water is still the number one killer of children under five years of age, and the United Nations estimates that without concrete action to solve the world's water crisis, billions more people will lack access to clean water by the middle of the century. See also: Earth Summit timeline . Add to that the effects of climate change, ocean acidification, dwindling biodiversity and collapsing global fish stocks, and the magnitude of the problem comes into dismal focus. Now, from June 20-22, 2012, leaders from around the world will gather again in Brazil for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, or Rio+20 as it is often called. There is no doubt that this conference comes at a difficult time; a time when the world economy is in crisis and global political action is particularly halting, especially and embarrassingly in the United States thanks to vitriolic partisan battles over any environmental legislation as well as the failure to enact even basic carbon-cutting initiatives. Nevertheless I believe that there are still grounds for hope. Because while the challenges we face are even more urgent than in 1992, the growing chorus of voices supporting sustainable practices in the private sector, the growing prominence and respect for women in countries around the world and the general willingness to face the realities of carbon pollution are cause for cautious optimism. We must never stop fighting for a better world. As my grandfather said in his closing remarks: ""I wish that at this Rio Conference, heads of state and their delegates realize the urgency of drastic, unconventional decisions. The people of the world are anxiously awaiting a new light."" Now, almost 20 years later, humanity stands on the edge of a knife that becomes sharper with each passing day. We must act boldly and courageously to build a world that realizes the simple birthright of every child ... to live in a world where they can breathe fresh air, drink clean water, and walk on green grass under a blue sky. The silent cries of future generations demand it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Philippe Cousteau.","Philippe Cousteau's grandfather Jacques was at first Earth Summit in Rio in 1992 .

"(CNN) -- Loathed by most, loved by virtually none, battlefield cuisine has left an indelible mark on the taste buds of American troops -- and it's not a good one. Marines eat their MREs in a burned-out hotel in Haqlaniyah, Iraq, in 2006. ""Meals Rejected by Everyone"" is a popular nickname for MREs, which stands for Meals Ready to Eat, those brownish polymer pouches filled with precooked food and snacks. While MREs provide food when there's no way to make it to the mess hall, they are no substitutes for what troops crave. ""They really want pizza and beer,"" says Judith Aylward, senior food technologist at the U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center in Natick, Massachusetts. She and a team of food technicians are working hard to improve the quality and the taste of combat food. And while they haven't been able to give servicemen and women everything they desire, troops are eating a variety of foods far more appetizing than the canned C-rations of World War II, Korea and Vietnam.  Explore the history of U.S. combat rations » . Soldiers now dine on penne pasta with vegetarian sausage in spicy tomato sauce, chicken breast fillet and boneless pork rib. ""I like to eat the chicken breast when on the move because it does not have any gravy, so it will not spill all over and make a mess, and it fills you up,"" said Army Staff Sgt. Joel Klein, of St. Petersburg, Florida, who served in Iraq. Klein is currently stationed at Fort Benning in Columbus, Georgia. The beef patty is also a favorite, Aylward says. ""It comes with two slices of wheat snack bread, and we include a package of cheese and BBQ sauce so they can feel like they are eating at McDonald's."" While perennial favorites like spaghetti and beef stew please most palates, old classics have fallen out of favor -- like Chicken a-la-King, affectionately called by some Chicken a-la-Death. Other entrees just never catch on. ""We had a tuna noodle casserole ... the troops really didn't like it,"" she says. ""My least favorite is the cheese omelet with vegetables,"" says Fort Benning Pvt. Antonio Kinslow, from Macon, Georgia. Klein's least favorite is also the omelet.  Watch as civilians taste MREs » . Opening up a case of today's MREs is a lot like walking into a mall food court, says Stephen Moody, team leader for the Individual Combat Ration Team. There are 24 MRE menus, and Italian, Mexican and vegetarian meals are represented. Whenever possible, familiar commercial items like M&Ms and Tabasco are tossed in -- a taste of home that boosts morale, Aylward says.  Find out what's in an MRE » . Troops enjoy mixing and matching MRE items, creating their own culinary recipes. ""Peanut Butter + Crackers + Coffee + Sugar + Creamer + Coco Base Powder (Crush it all up and mix in a little water) = Instant Joy,"" according to 1st. Sgt. Donel Hagelin, from Fayetteville, North Carolina. Hagelin is also based at Fort Benning and served in Iraq and Afghanistan. The flexible pouch-based meals have been around for more than 20 years. In the early 1980s, the military replaced the C-ration with the MRE, a 1,200- to 1,300-calorie entree meal with snacks, spreads and a dessert. And it's a hot meal -- just place the entree in the flameless ration heater bag, add water, and a chemical reaction warms the food in 10 minutes. Troops can enjoy a hot cup of coffee with the included plastic-zippered hot beverage bag. ""All items in the MRE are useful, from the matches to the toilet paper,"" Hagelin says. MREs are considered restricted rations -- food eaten when regular meal services cannot be provided. They are meant to be eaten for up to 21 days and have a three-year shelf life. ""There are a lot of great commercial items where if we only needed six months [of shelf life], we could just go down to the Kroger or the Safeway and grab what's popular, but there aren't a whole lot of things on the shelf that last for three years at 80 degrees Fahrenheit,"" Moody says. The military uses the three-year shelf life to maintain its ""war reserves."" There are millions of cases of MREs positioned around the world at any given time for contingencies, he explains. Sometimes, the military needs something more practical than the MRE. During intense combat operations, troops don't have time to heat an MRE, and they don't have the space to carry nine of them, enough food for a typical 72-hour mission. To give troops something to eat on the go, the team at Natick came up with the First Strike Ration, or FSR -- pocket sandwiches and snack food that can be eaten throughout the day. One FSR has 3,600 to 3,900 calories and is packed with energy boosters like nutrition bars, electrolyte beverages and caffeinated gum. One FSR is equal to three MREs. Moody says troops in Iraq and Afghanistan are downing a lot of Red Bull and Starbucks products. ""We've got a group of young caffeine drinkers on our hands,"" he said. ""We're trying to meet those needs for them."" Several thousand assault ration prototypes were shipped to Iraq, Afghanistan, Germany, Kuwait and Haiti, and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive on the weight savings vs. the MRE. The military estimates the assault ration will begin shipping to troops in November. E-mail to a friend .","Army technicians working to improve quality, taste of combat food .

"(CNN) -- The death toll from the collapse of a large department store in Ghana this week is now 12, a store spokesman told CNN Saturday. The six-story Melcom building crumpled Wednesday morning in a suburb of Accra, the West African nation's capital. Rescue workers searched for survivors trapped under rubble.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Chinese President Hu Jintao, set to begin handing over power to his successor, warned Thursday that a failure to deal with corruption could bring down China's ruling Communist Party and the state it controls. Hu was speaking at the party's 18th National Congress in Beijing, a key meeting of top officials that will usher in a new set of leaders of the world's most populous nation. After a decade in power, Hu is expected to hand over the party's top job to Vice President Xi Jinping. ""If we fail to handle this issue well, it could prove fatal to the party, and even cause the collapse of the party and the fall of the state,"" Hu said of corruption during his speech at the start of the congress in the Great Hall of the People in the heart of the Chinese capital. His comments to a vast room full of delegates stood out in light of the huge political scandal that has rocked the party this year. The controversy involved the former high-flying politician Bo Xilai who is now under criminal investigation after being ousted from his posts and the party itself. He is accused of corruption, abuse of power and improper sexual relationships; official news reports have said Bo made ""severe mistakes"" related to the killing of a British businessman -- a crime for which Bo's wife was imprisoned -- and a diplomatic incident involving his former police chief in Chongqing. More than 2,200 delegates from across China are gathering for the Congress, and they in turn select the 200-plus members of the party's Central Committee, who in turn appoint the Politburo and ultimately the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee -- the country's decision-makers. But most, if not all, of the outcomes are predetermined after a long period of secretive deal-making between party power brokers. The congress itself meets every five years. It is designed to assess the country's progress, and set new directions. Every 10 years it selects the new leadership. This year, the legacy of the Hu years is under the microscope. Under Hu and Premier Wen Jiabao, China's economy has continued to grow, lifting tens of millions of people out of poverty. China is now the world's second-biggest economy and closing fast on the United States. But there have been disappointments and discontent along the way, and Hu's much vaunted ""harmonious society"" is showing signs of cracking. Chinese leaders have endured a tumultuous year. The veil of secrecy around the party has been lifted, with reports of rifts and infighting. And the fall of Bo brought about China's biggest political scandal in decades. Bo, once party chief of the massive metropolis of Chongqing, is now in disgrace awaiting trial. His wife, Gu Kailai, is in prison, convicted of murdering a British business associate. Senior party leaders and their leaders have had to deal with unusual scrutiny of their affairs, with Western news organizations publishing investigations into the wealth accumulated by the families of Xi and Wen. Chinese authorities responded to the reports by blocking the websites of the news organizations involved: Bloomberg News and The New York Times. But China's army of censors is having to grapple with the rapid rise of social media platforms on which information moves and mutates at a dizzying pace. China is treading many fault lines: a widening gap between rich and poor, rising unrest about issues like pollution and land seizures, and a slowing economy that some say is in need of serious reform. Hu mentioned some of those tensions Thursday along with several other contentious issues -- like food safety, health care and law enforcement -- acknowledging that ""there are a lot of difficulties and problems on our road ahead."" Another issue Hu's government has struggled to tackle during its decade in power is the discontent and unrest among Tibetans living under Chinese rule. Authorities were given a grim reminder on Wednesday of the disillusionment and desperation of many Tibetans in western areas of China after four people set themselves on fire to protest Chinese rule. One teenage Tibetan monk died and two were injured after self-immolating in a majority Tibetan region of Sichuan Province, said Penpa Tsering, a spokesman for the Tibetan parliament in exile in Dharamsala, India. And a 23-year-old Tibetan woman died a separate incident in Qinghai Province, Tsering said, citing unidentified people in Tibetan areas. Dozens of Tibetans are reported to have set themselves ablaze in the past 18 months to express their unhappiness with Chinese rule. In his speech Thursday, Hu also made a case for China to strengthen its presence on the seas off its coast. Beijing has become embroiled in a string of territorial disputes with countries like Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam over areas thought to contain large reserves of natural resources under the sea bed. The leadership should ""build China into a maritime power,"" Hu said, citing the need to exploit marine resources and ""resolutely safeguard China's maritime rights and interests"" among the goals.

"Rio de Janeiro (CNN) -- World leaders poured into Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday, 20 years after the landmark Earth Summit, to commit themselves to a new roadmap for sustainable development -- with that roadmap already under fire for failing to set firm goals. The three-day Rio+20 Summit opened with words of warning from the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. ""Let us match words with actions,"" he told reporters. ""Our scarcest resource is time, and it is running out."" More than 50,000 delegates are expected to participate in the conference, which is aimed at promoting economic growth and poverty reduction while simultaneously preserving the planet's resources. Population growth can't be ignored . But the summit has been overshadowed by the crisis in Europe and by key elections in the United States and elsewhere that have hobbled governments' ability, or willingness, to act. Notable no-shows included U.S. President Barack Obama, British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Negotiations over a final document that would be signed by leaders when they flew in dragged on until the last moment because countries could not agree on many of the more polemic issues. Even Ban said he had higher expectations. ""I know some member states hoped to have a bolder and more ambitious outcome document,"" Ban said. ""I also hoped that we should have a more ambitious outcome document."" The resulting text is an often vague commitment to sustainable development, without measurable targets or financial commitments. Can summit solve environmental problems? Many member states nonetheless praised the host government for getting all countries to finally agree on a document. The U.S. delegation, represented by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, called the summit a ""historic opportunity to communicate the value of sustainable development and help galvanize real-world, collaborative action to stimulate growth, protect the environment and provide a healthy future for our citizens."" Businesses played a much bigger role at this summit than they did 20 years ago, with many observers saying they have actually taken the lead by providing real examples of sustainable development. Georg Kell, head of the U.N. Global Compact, said his group hopes to increase the number of companies agreeing to concrete sustainable development goals to 20,000, from 7,000. ""I hope also we will be able to inspire governments to have the courage to set the right incentives,"" he told CNN. Extinction threat 'a call to world leaders' On Wednesday, the first session of the high-level summit was addressed by 17-year-old activist Brittany Trilford of New Zealand, who challenged leaders: ""Are you here to save face or are you here to save us?"" Ban suggested that the highly criticized final document could still be revised by world leaders before the summit ends on Friday. When asked by reporters about that possibility, he responded: ""Why do we have a summit meeting? Why have I been inviting and urging leaders, heads of state and government? They are the ones who can make political decisions, who can make a choice.""","More than 50,000 delegates are expected in Rio de Janeiro for the Rio+20 Summit .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The air was declared clean, but the carcinogen asbestos was found in dust and debris hurled into midtown Manhattan by a steam pipe explosion the day before, New York City announced Thursday. A steam pipe burst in midtown Manhattan during rush hour Wednesday. The city's Department of Emergency Management will continue to test the debris after finding asbestos in six of 10 samples, according to a statement from the city's Office of Emergency Management. ""People who may (have come) into contact with the steam or debris should take a shower and place their clothes in plastic bags for cleaning or disposal,"" the statement said. Asbestos is a fibrous mineral used to insulate pipes. Longterm exposure can cause allergies, skin problems and cancer. The 6 p.m. blast, which sent sent plumes of smoke and ash into the air around Grand Central Terminal, killed a woman and injured at least 44, according to authorities and local hospitals.  Watch an I-Reporter's video of ""volcano"" in street » . Lois Baumerich, of Hawthorne, New Jersey, died of cardiac arrest, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. Three firefighters and a police officer were treated on the scene for minor injuries, according to a New York Fire Department spokesman. Bellevue Hospital Center received 14 patients, including Baumerich, hospital Administrator Larry Dugan said. New York Presbyterian Hospital said it received 27 injured people, 25 of whom were treated and released. As of Thursday, one person was listed in critical condition and another in serious. The area encompassed by 40th and 43rd streets and Vanderbilt and Third avenues was ""frozen"" because of the asbestos threat.  Map of blast site » . Those in that zone are allowed to stay in the area, but should use caution. No one will be allowed to enter the zone, the Office of Emergency Management said. ""People inside buildings in the frozen zone should keep windows closed and switch air conditioners to recirculate the air inside instead of drawing in air from outside,"" the office said. Also, parts of Lexington Avenue, Third Avenue, Park Avenue, 42nd Street and Vanderbilt Avenue will be closed to traffic. Subway lines near the explosion were initially rerouted to bypass Grand Central Terminal, but the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said Thursday the subway infrastructure was not damaged. Bloomberg told reporters the pipe that exploded was installed in 1924. ""There was cold water getting into the pipe, and cold water apparently causes these to explode,"" the mayor said. ""It might have been bursts of cold water from the rain or because of another water main break."" Hundreds of people frantically fled the scene as police, fire and utility officials converged on the area around the blast, which left a crater 25 feet wide and 15 feet deep, according to utility provider Con Edison. More than 170 firefighters were dispatched to the site, the fire department said.  Blast leaves massive crater » . ""The ground was literally shaking under your feet,"" New York police Deputy Commission Paul Browne said. Video from the scene showed steam and mud erupting from underground. A small school bus had its windows and one of its doors blown out. One witness, former CNN reporter Adaora Udoji, described the scene as ""pandemonium."" Within about 20 minutes, she said, authorities had the entire area locked down. ""It felt like an earthquake. We saw hundreds and hundreds of people running down Third Avenue,"" she said. ""They were screaming, they were crying."" The New York Times reported that the rush-hour blast sent up a geyser of steam, mud and rust-colored gunk, and displaced chunks of pavement in one of the busiest parts of the city. Pedestrians scrambled to flee the blast -- some running out of their shoes -- as those working in the skyscrapers pelted with debris looked down in horror, the newspaper reported, comparing the aftermath of the blast to a hailstorm. Some witnesses said the jet of steam roared like Niagara Falls, The New York Times reported. Carol Bergendale, who witnessed the blast, told WABC that commuters in the area began driving in the wrong direction to get away. Despite initial fears, Browne said the blast had nothing to do with terrorism, and the FBI said there was nothing suspicious about the blast.

"London (CNN) -- The Church of England named former oil executive Justin Welby as the next archbishop of Canterbury, making him the titular leader of the world's 77 million Anglicans. Welby, who has been a bishop for only a year, is considered an outspoken critic of the excesses of capitalism, a supporter of women bishops and an opponent of gay marriage. He will be enthroned as archbishop of Canterbury on March 21. Read more: CNN Belief Blog . Speaking as his appointment was announced Friday at Lambeth Palace in London, Welby said it was a privilege to take the helm at a time when the ""tide of events is turning"" and the church has great opportunities to be involved in a changing world. ""To be nominated to this post is both astonishing and exciting,"" he said, adding that it is a time for ""optimism and for faith in the church"" as it faces tough issues. One of those issues is the ordination of women bishops, on which the General Synod will vote later this month. Welby said he would be voting in favor -- and urged the Synod to go ahead with the change. Welby said he supported the opposition voiced by the Church of England earlier this year in response to a British government consultation on upgrading same-sex ""civil partnerships"" to gay marriage. However, he added, the church must not accept any form of homophobia. Read more: Head of Anglican church to step down . Welby acknowledged that homosexuality is a highly divisive issue within the wider Anglican Communion, but said he would listen ""very attentively"" to the concerns of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community. He promised to ""examine my own thinking carefully and prayerfully"" on gay issues. Paying tribute to the faith and charitable work of churchgoers and clergy around the country, Welby, who is currently the bishop of Durham, said he felt ""utterly optimistic about the future of the church."" Reflecting on his wider role, Welby said the Anglican Communion, ""for all its difficulties, is also a source of remarkable blessing to the world."" He singled out northern Nigeria, where churches have been targeted in deadly attacks by the militant Islamist group Boko Haram, as a place where Christians are under particular pressure. Peppered with wry jokes, his speech displayed a sense of humor and down-to-earth attitude that may help him negotiate the minefield of conflicting views and interests within the vast Anglican Communion. Educated at Cambridge University, Welby worked for oil companies in Paris and London before training for the ministry. His appointment was approved by Queen Elizabeth II, as supreme governor of the Church of England. He will take over from Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, who has headed the church for more than a decade. Welby paid tribute to Williams' moral courage and learning, and said he would be a hard act to follow. ""The church worldwide owes him a great debt, more than it knows, and I shall be continuing to seek his advice and wisdom,"" the archbishop-elect said. The secretary general of the Anglican Communion, Canon Kenneth Kearon, welcomed the news of the appointment, saying Welby ""already has rich knowledge and experience of the Anglican Communion, and brings great pastoral and intellectual gifts to this position. ""He is a gifted communicator, deeply committed to the engagement between the Christian faith and an increasingly challenging secular society."" The news was also welcomed by the archbishop of Westminster, the Most Reverend Vincent Nichols, who heads the Catholic Church in England and Wales. ""I know that Bishop Welby will bring many personal gifts and experience to his new role,"" he said in a statement. ""As the future primate of the Church of England, I am sure that his ministry, like that of his predecessor Archbishop Rowan Williams, will provide an important Christian witness to this country over the coming years."" In the United States, Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori of the Episcopal Church said Welby's experience of churches in different countries and his ""knowledge of the immense challenges of the world"" would stand him in good stead. ""His gifts of reconciliation and discernment will be abundantly tested"" in the role, she added.","NEW: Church leaders welcome Justin Welby's appointment .

"(CNN) -- Political consensus was hard to find at last month's Rio +20 Earth Summit but there was at least one group speaking with unity on the planet's environmental and economic future. Hundreds of activists gathered on the city's Copacabana Beach to make a simple demand of their elected leaders and representatives: Commit to ending fossil fuel subsidies, now. More than a million people around the world -- including actor Robert Redford and comedian Stephen Fry - were quick to lend their support by backing #endfossilfuelsubsidies, an affiliated online campaign. But as the summit came to a close it became clear that no new enforceable commitments on the issue were to be included in the final version of the Rio agreement text. For those behind the protest however, the widespread exposure and support afforded the oft ignored subject ensured their efforts still represented a success. See also: Was Rio +20 a failure of political leadership? ""This all falls into changing our energy usage patterns, which I believe is the pre-eminent challenge of the 21st century,"" says Steve Kretzmann, founder of Oil Change International, an environmental advocacy group that backs the #endfossilfuelsubsidies campaign. ""The first place to start is to stop putting public money towards fossil fuels,"" he adds. ""This is not because anybody has it in for the fossil fuel industry. What we're talking about is what the public's money actually should support."" Estimates as to how much this support equates to vary from study to study, as do methods and standards for calculation. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that internationally $409 billion worth of government money flowed into the coffers of the fossil fuel industry in consumption subsidies (designed to make fuel more affordable and accessible to the consumer) in 2010. A separate study from the U.S. Natural Resources Defense Council estimates that global fossil fuel subsidies will reach $775 billion this year when producer subsidies (designed to facilitate greater fuel production) are added on. However Kretzmann believes these figures may only be the tip of the iceberg and could actually top $1 trillion every year. He says there is often a lack of transparency in how some governments report the incentives, with many transferred as hard-to-calculate tax credits. Kretzmann similarly laments the comparatively sparse investment in renewable energy subsidies (which stood at $66 billion in 2010 according to the IEA) as a wasted opportunity to create less polluting energy sources whilst encouraging growth in the green economy. ""At the end of the day, not only is this bad policy but its also bad economics,"" he says. ""Long term, renewables are a better option for the environment and the economy. There are multiple studies that show how much more labor intensive renewables are and how they create more jobs per unit of energy created."" See also: Who's funding green energy . However others are more cautious about the consequences that an about-turn in energy policy could create. ""In certain countries and situations, subsidies are essential to peoples way of life,"" says Dan Kish the deputy vice-president of policy at the Institute for Energy Research, a Washington D.C. based organization that advocates free market energy policies. Any alteration to this arrangement could cause prices to balloon, weakening development and in the worst case scenario leading to social unrest, he adds. Kish points out that a large proportion of subsidies are in fact designed to keep fuel prices artificially low, enabling consumers in some of the world's poorest regions access to basic energy products. ""At the G20 they are calling for the end of fossil fuels subsidies but what they are really talking about is the developing world,"" he says. ""If you want a pejorative to describe the situation ... what we've got is a bunch of rich countries whose people have used energy to become rich assigning blame for subsidies on those countries that are poorer."" See also: The problem with fossil fuel subsidies . Kish also believes that renewables still can't compete with traditional energy sources in terms of their cost effectiveness, accessibility and energy output. ""The only fair way to look at subsidies is to analyze the subsidy per unit of energy produced. On that score the numbers are incredibly slanted against renewables,"" he says. ""Just because you can make energy from something doesn't mean that it makes sense competitively or economically."" Effective and efficient energy policy in the long term, Kish explains, would see individual countries pursue the sources of energy that are most accessible and affordable to them, be they renewable or fossil fuel. ""The best energy policy is that which makes energy as cheap, reliable and abundant as possible for the most people so that economies can grow,"" he says.","Activists called for an end to fossil fuel subsidies at last month's Rio +20 Earth Summit .

"Far Rockaway, New York (CNN) -- First Sandy. Then a nor'easter. Residents in this small hamlet at the eastern edge of Rockaway Peninsula are exhausted and on edge. Eleven days after Superstorm Sandy made landfall, flooding nearly all of the Rockaways, they are still cold and in the dark. Huddled beneath blankets and with the car's heat cranked up, 56-year-old Matt Lintonmapp Jr. has spent every night sleeping in his car since Sandy left him homeless. ""My place got washed out,"" he said, adding that work and community ties have kept him from evacuating. ""There's nothing left."" Parked by the liquor store where he works, Lintonmapp has squeezed in a few hours of sleep each night while keeping an eye out for looters. ""I'm a survivor,"" he said with a certain New Yorker's swagger that now barely masks the slight quake in his voice. Waiting for gas, he said, ""I hope everyone on this line is a survivor too, because we're all together now."" The frustration has boiled over at times. In Long Island, Oceanside residents booed local and federal officials who came to address power restoration. ""What are you doing for us?"" they shouted. Earlier in the week, fistfights broke out at relief supply depots in Far Rockaway, Queens, just as the first snowfall of the year blanketed the region and ushered in fresh misery to those already battered by Sandy. Many, like Lintonmapp, have had no choice but to eat meals that the National Guard is handing out. ""It's all right. The military came through for me,"" he said. ""They're not too bad."" Clean, running water is also in shorter supply across the peninsula in the wake of the crisis. Some residents were seen carrying buckets of water to wash down their toilets. Others boiled water to drink later or use for cooking. Still, gas remains the crucial thing here. Cloaked in blankets and heavy clothing, shivering residents queued up at one of Far Rockaway's few fuel depots on Thursday, often carrying two or three gas cans at a time. Puffy winter jackets wrapped around young children who accompanied their parents rather than stay in damp, cold homes. And many commuters remained stranded as Long Island rail lines remained down there and in Long Beach. ""A majority of people work in the city and there's no transportation,"" said Margarita Alvarez, 41, whose home was badly damaged during last week's storm. ""You just can't get to work."" Other residents, like 60-year-old Rosemary Shephard, are using the fuel for generators. ""I thank God for this gas,"" Shephard said after finally filling her gas can. In an effort to alleviate the long gas lines, police on Friday began enforcing a new alternating fuel ration system in New York City and Long Island. Drivers with license plates that end with a letter or an odd number can fill up Friday. Those with even numbers or zero can fill up Saturday, and so on. Authorities cut off Shephard's electricity last Monday, along with thousands of others, as a precaution ahead of Sandy. But unlike other storm refugees now holed up in warmer places with family and friends, Shephard decided to stay put in her Far Rockaway home. ""You have to stay,"" she said. ""If I leave, what would happen to my house when I got back?"" More than a week after floodwater rushed into her basement, destroyed her property and soaked her circuit box with salt water, there is still no clear sign of when power might be restored. Meanwhile, the weather has been getting colder. ""It was freezing last night,"" she said. Unfortunately, getting power back is not just matter of fixing substations and flipping a switch. City officials say electricians are now needed for homes like Shephard's, whose house is flagged with a yellow sticker, so that electrical cabling and circuit boxes can be individually checked before the power grid is restored. That means contractors must go door-to-door checking houses, adding to the time it takes for the power to return, while temperatures drop. Just down the street are the charred remains of more than 100 homes destroyed in an inferno that raged in the coastal community of Breezy Point, making officials especially wary of the risk of electrical fires. More than a half million households are still in the dark across New Jersey and New York, including nearly 40,000 homes on Rockaway Peninsula. Without a clear timetable for restoration, the town is rife with speculation. And that effect has fueled mounting tension. ""I'm pissed, just like everybody else is,"" said Pat Lee, 55, an iron worker who normally commutes to Lower Manhattan but has been out of work since the storm hit. ""The biggest problem really ain't so much the electricity. It's that no one knows when we're going to get it. They won't even give you a ballpark figure,"" he said. A Long Island Power Authority spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment regarding restoration of the Far Rockaway area. The utility's website indicates there is ""a long road ahead."" LIPA has dispatched some 250 utility workers to the Rockaways, working 16-hour shifts in a round-the-clock operation to get power restored. But soggy and salt-caked electrical panels and wiring in homes and businesses ""could present unsafe conditions when re-energizing those areas or facilities, the utility says on its website. Police are working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Guard to provide evacuation services and have set up heating areas for residents, while churches and aid groups hand out food and water. A nonprofit called the Fuel Relief Fund donated the fuel, but its supplies are limited. ""Right now we have to clean up, so I don't know if this is the place to be for people right now,"" said New York Police Department Deputy Inspector Scott Olexa, who described the surrounding damage as ""unparalleled."" ""I know people are attached to their homes and their neighborhood, but emergency services have to get in here."" Earlier this week, the city opened a relief center a few blocks away in a building once submerged in five feet of water, bringing generators and gas to those still battling the cold. In Manhattan, only about 200 customers now remain in the dark -- a fact that does not escape most Rockaway storm victims. ""They're going about their lives, and we're the ones at the end of the line,"" said Margarita Alvarez. ""They did the city first and they just forgot about us.""","Many on New York's Rockaway Peninsula are still without power and running water .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to choosing the paint color of automobiles, drivers really are predictable. The top paint color choice in 2012 for U.S. car buyers is white (21%), matching similar findings almost 10 years ago; black (19%) is a close second, followed by silver and gray (16% each). If you're driving anything painted green, celebrate your uniqueness, you rebel. Only 2% of drivers said they'd be caught behind the wheel of a green-colored vehicle. Worldwide, white ranks first (22%) and silver is second (20%), followed by black (19%), gray (12%), red (9%), blue (7%), green (2%) and other colors (1%), according to the study released Wednesday by automobile paint manufacturer PPG. Self-driving cars now legal in California . Customers shopping for sports cars, SUVs and high-end luxury cars said choosing the right color was more of a priority than did customers buying less expensive rides. The vehicle paint colors people choose are also having an effect on the design of other products, researchers found. ""Color is one of the first characteristics noticed in product design, and it is increasingly being used in everyday items, from cell phones to large appliances, based largely on automotive trends,"" said PPG's Jane E. Harrington in a release announcing the study's findings. ""The palette being developed for the automotive segment continues to be influenced by culture, nature, fashion, interior design, color popularity and new pigment technology."" The paint manufacturing company introduced 64 new exterior shades to automotive designers for consideration in designs of the 2015-2016 model years. These included colors such as Al Fresco, a silver metallic with fresh green tint; Victoria Grey, a classic gray with an iridescent highlight of gold metal; Opulence, a refined red pearl with intense jewel tone; Glacier, an icy graphite gray with a slight violet blue tone; Sunshine, a bright high-sparkle intense yellow; and Elixir, a metallic mixture of silver and magenta. Customers say they want more paint options, but color preferences haven't changed much during the past decade.

"(CNN) -- The first week his debut album, ""Up All Night,"" came out, Kip Moore found himself nestled in the Billboard 200's Top 10 between the likes of Jack White, Adele, Lionel Richie, Nicki Minaj and Jason Mraz. The late April release landed at No. 6, an impressive showing for a guy who's released two singles so far. But one of those singles -- a joyous country-rock tune called ""Somethin' 'Bout a Truck,"" an ode to rule breakin' with a girl on the tailgate of a truck bed -- has done remarkably well since its release in September. It's been certified gold and has sold more than 700,000 digital singles, with the video viewed nearly 7 million times on YouTube. For Moore fans, the appetite for more music has been growing steadily for about seven months. And it couldn't come at a better time for the Georgia native, who's been primarily making his living in Nashville over the last four years as a songwriter with a publishing deal as well as a touring musician, playing bars and small clubs across the country. ""I've been writing about two songs a day for about seven or eight years,"" the 32-year-old singer told CNN from a tour stop in New Hampshire last month. ""(When I moved to) Nashville, it was a move because that's what I really wanted to do. I think it's natural when you get to a town like that, you question, 'Are you good enough?' every single day. ""I was below the bar I needed to be when I first got there. I questioned going home all the time my first few years. You see your friends around you building a foundation with their jobs, retirement, family -- not that those things are what I want now, but you could look up, and you're 40 years old -- all of a sudden you have nothing to show for it."" Before moving to Nashville in the early 2000s with songwriting aspirations, Moore credits the time he spent in Hawaii after college for helping him get his songwriting skills up to snuff. He'd grown up on artists such as Bob Seger, Jackson Browne and Willie Nelson. As a kid, he fondly recalls his father playing their music often in the car on the way to go fishing on the Gulf Coast, but he didn't really know what he wanted to do with his life until he hit the big island. ""I lived in a little hut with a backpack and went to the beach every day,"" Moore recalled. ""I wrote a lot of songs out there. 'Everything But You' is strictly from that experience. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. I've always been a little bit like that. I worked a bunch of odd jobs, but I realized out there that with my personality, unless I was doing music, there was no way I was going to be happy."" It's been noted that Moore has that blue-collar Bruce Springsteen thing going on, and you can certainly hear that scruff in his voice at times, along with a healthy dose of rock 'n' roll fused within all of his songs. But on ""Up All Night,"" Moore doesn't sing about the plight of the working class; instead, he's much more apt to detail life after the whistle blows and the paycheck's been cashed. The joys of ice cold beer, sunshine, a favorite girl in a favorite sundress -- he spins all of these notions into simple stories that sound blissful, with a little bit of a devilish streak to them. ""Sometimes a songwriter can get in the way of things,"" he said. ""I try to just speak it like how I felt people would say it. How I would say it. I feel like people are relating to how I say it, and people are moved by some of those songs."" Moore's slated to spend most of the summer on the road, playing a mixture of club dates and state fairs, and he's finally ready to admit that he might just make it as a musician. ""Recently, we've been selling out these clubs and see how rabid these people are for the music,"" he said. ""They knew all these tracks before they'd been released. I've felt this wave in the past two weeks, where I've thought things might be all right.""","Kip Moore's debut album, ""Up All Night,"" landed in Billboard 200's Top 10 .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama and Republican candidate Mitt Romney traded accusations on tax policy Thursday, with both claiming at campaign stops in battleground states that the other's strategies have failed. Romney used a rally in Golden, Colorado, to unveil a simplified campaign message called for by some Republican strategists, laying out a five-point plan that he said would put the nation back on the correct economic path. The proposals are traditional conservative stances on domestic energy production, trade, job training, deficit reduction and boosting small businesses, with Romney promising that, if elected, he would deliver on them to unleash the full potential of the U.S. economy. ""His policies have not worked. They have not gotten America back to work again,"" Romney said of Obama, citing 41 straight months of unemployment over 8%. ""I'm going to get America working again."" In particular, Romney challenged Obama's call for extending lower tax rates, set to expire at the end of this year, only for income up to $250,000 for families or $200,000 for individuals, which would allow the rates on income above those marks to increase to 1990s levels. Calling that plan a tax increase, Romney said it would inhibit the job creation needed for economic growth and described the Obama policy as being ""like a dog trying to chase its tail."" In Orlando, Florida, Obama attacked Romney's call for more tax cuts as an example of long-standing Republican policy that was most recently enacted by his predecessor, helping bring the recession that was in place when Obama took office. ""They have tried to sell us tax cut fairy dust before,"" Obama said. ""It is not a plan to move our economy forward. It takes us backward to a place we don't need to be."" Obama blasts Romney tax plan in Ohio . The president also made a campaign visit to Virginia, while Romney joined Republican governors -- including several potential running mates -- at an Aspen, Colorado, conference. In a format resembling a celebrity ""roast"" -- but one with blue blazers and verbal bouquets instead of vulgar put-downs -- the seated governors rose one-by-one to praise Romney. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called Romney a man of ""fabulous ingenuity"" and ""great integrity."" ""We need you, we're looking forward to your services as president,"" said Gov. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma. ""I really appreciate your focus on middle class families,"" Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell told Romney. In a hint that Romney's decision on a running mate might come soon, his longtime adviser Beth Myers, who heads up the campaign's search for a vice presidential candidate, will be traveling with Romney to Colorado. Polls show that Romney and Obama are statistically even in Colorado and Virginia, while Obama holds a small lead in Florida. All three states are among the eight or so considered vital to the chances of both candidates in November. The CNN Electoral Map . Reviving the American dream of equal opportunity has been the central theme of Obama's campaign, and Romney's new five-point message Thursday was an effort to blunt the president's middle class outreach. In general, it rehashes Romney's previously stated stances on energy, taxes, deficit reduction, trade and small business development but offers few details . For example, the energy component involves easing regulations to expand domestic production of oil, coal and natural gas. A conference call by Romney's advisers made no mention of alternative sources such as solar or wind energy championed by Obama, but Romney included continued pursuit of such programs in his later remarks in Colorado. The tax component came under heavy criticism from Obama, who cited a study by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center that says Romney's proposals would provide large cuts to the very wealthy while increasing the burden on the lower and middle classes. Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior Romney campaign adviser, called the report ""a joke"" on Thursday's conference call, while Romney economic adviser Kevin Hassett said it fails to include the projected revenue increase from an expanded employment base that Romney's policies would bring. ""Eliminating that from your analysis means you're going to have a very, very biased result,"" Hassett said. Romney officials also complained that one of the study's three authors was a former member of Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. In his Florida remarks, Obama ridiculed the Romney team's criticism of the report, noting another of the co-authors was an economist in the administration of Republican President George H.W. Bush. ""They said (the report) didn't take into account the economic growth that would result from tax cuts,"" Obama said, drawing laughter when he added: ""We all know how well that worked the last time they tried it."" Romney calls for cutting today's rates by 20% as well as eliminating the Alternative Minimum Tax and limiting current deductions, exemptions and credits available to top-level income earners. However, Romney has yet to say which specific tax breaks he plans to eliminate, and the Tax Policy Center report indicated the result of his plan would force the tax burden to shift toward lower- and middle-class Americans. In its study, the Tax Policy Center did not score Romney's plan directly, saying it lacked sufficient details. Instead, the center said the plan represented a number of Republican proposals. The Romney campaign officials said Thursday that the specifics of the tax proposal remain to be worked out, with deputy policy director Jonathan Burks adding that Romney, if elected, ""would write a tax bill that would achieve those goals."" ""It's not a question of today we have a 2,000-page tax plan,"" Burks said. Tax policy has become a central economic issue, with Congress deadlocked over proposals to extend most or all of the Bush-era tax cuts set to expire at the end of the year. House passes Republican tax-cut plan . Romney and Republicans want to extend all the Bush tax cuts for now to prevent any increase, while Obama says the lower rates should not continue for the wealthiest 2% of Americans to bring more fairness to the system. Both sides call for comprehensive tax reform after the election as part of necessary deficit reduction steps. The issue touches on the foundations of the nation's political divide, with Republicans driven by their conservative base seeking to shrink government to reduce deficits while Democrats want a blend of spending cuts and more tax revenue in order to maintain what they consider essential services and entitlement programs. With just over three months until the November election, the race has become a contentious struggle to convince voters that the other guy would take the country in the wrong direction. In anticipation of Obama's Florida trip Thursday, the Romney campaign released a new ad in the state that blames the president for a stalling economy there. Romney ad hits Obama on Florida economy . Florida, currently rated a ""toss up"" on CNN's Electoral Map, has been hard hit by a weak housing market. Its unemployment rate of 8.6% is higher than the national average, but down from a high of 11.4% in 2010. A Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times poll released Wednesday showed Obama with a 51%-45% lead in Florida, which has 29 electoral votes. Another new Romney ad Wednesday hammered Obama over unemployment and other economic problems, saying: ""Americans need a change. We need a new president."" Campaigns turn to economy ahead of jobs report . Obama's campaign responded to the ad by citing Romney's opposition to the auto industry bailout. ""Let's get this straight -- the very person who argued for the U.S. auto industry to go bankrupt, something that would have caused more than a million jobs lost and utter economic devastation in the Midwest, is now trying to attack the president on how it was handled?"" campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith said in a written statement. Meanwhile, the liberal group MoveOn.org will run a 30-second television spot in battleground states mocking the amount of money spent on Rafalca, the dressage horse competing at the London Olympics that is co-owned by Romney's wife, Ann. Looking a dressage horse in the mouth . The group said the ad to air in Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania is told from the perspective of the horse, pointing out that the Romneys spend $77,000 a year for its upkeep. ""After Mitt Romney repeals health care and ships your jobs overseas, I daresay your life won't be nearly as pampered as mine,"" it concludes. ""After all, you're not one of his horses."" In a statement, MoveOn.org's executive director said the group was not lampooning the horse itself. ""There's nothing wrong with taking good care of a horse, but there's something messed up about a millionaire who spends twice what most Americans make in a year caring for a horse, but wants to take away people's health care and offshore their jobs,"" Justin Ruben wrote.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- When Shaun Rein drives to Shanghai's Pudong International Airport, about 10 minutes outside the airfield, he begins to notice a line of cars -- including Rolls Royces and Bentleys -- parked along the side of the highway. ""Why? It's because these people, who can spend a million dollars on a car, don't want to spend $2 on parking at the garage,"" said Rein, managing director at China Market Research Group. For Chinese leaders, the nation's newfound wealth represents a bumpy road as they try to steer the economy on a new path. The ruling Communist Party (CCP) continues meetings this week for the 18th Party Congress, where it is expected to select Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang to become the president and premier, respectively, of China for the next decade. Hu warns of corruption as congress begins . One of the great challenges the new leadership faces is to move the economy -- currently driven by exports and investment -- toward a more sustainable course led by domestic consumer spending. While domestic consumption is rising, it still makes up just over one-third of the China's total economy. American consumers, by comparison, power more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Much has been made of China's growing group of super rich which has spurred record sales for luxury goods makers such as Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Prada. The nation has an estimated one million people with a net worth of $1 million or more, and that is expected to grow 2.5 times in the next three years, Rein said. But much of the hope of the rising domestic spending rests with China's growing middle class. There are an estimated 350 million people in China's middle class, which are households that earn between $6,000 and $15,000, Rein said. A government think tank predicted last week that by 2020 there will be 600 million Chinese earning middle-class incomes. ""But they are not really middle class in the American sense. In the U.S., you're born a blue collar worker, your parents were blue collar, your grandparents -- and you're proud of that, you have that identity. And you like to shop at Macy's on special occasions,"" Rein said. ""In China, you don't have that -- that doesn't really exist. Everyone here says they're going to be rich,"" he added. China business: 'Mao is not coming back' That growth represents eye-popping opportunities for foreign multinationals and domestic companies. Chinese consumers prefer overseas brands for consumer electronics yet favor domestic companies for personal care or household items, according to a recent report by McKinsey & Company. And foreign companies that got into the market early -- such as General Motors -- are now raking in record profits. But as outgoing President Hu Jintao noted last week, concerns remain. He set an ambitious target for 2020 to double per capita income in China from 2010 levels for both rural and urban dwellers to address the rising wealth disparity. China's per capita income was $4,423 in 2010, according to the International Monetary Fund. ""Unbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable development remains a big problem,"" Hu said in his speech at the Party congress. ""I think what's more alarming or more worrisome is how big is it going to get? Will it continue to grow and drive economic growth not only in China but for the world? Or will it stagnate under a mountain of new debt -- debt from expensive housing to the cost of educating your kids to health care costs?"" said Karl Gerth, author of ""As China Goes, So Goes the World: How Chinese Consumers Are Transforming Everything."" ""These are all things that the government is trying to address by reinstituting some semblance of a social safety net, so instead of saving 40 or 50% of their disposable incomes, people can start to spend it,"" adds Gerth, who teaches at Merton College of the University of Oxford. Photos: China's top leaders meet . For foreign companies, there are mounting worries of roadblocks from Beijing to prevent access to the growing Chinese domestic market. Last summer, a report from the European Union Chamber of Commerce showed that more than 40% of members said they think government policies for multinational companies are less fair than two years ago, and 22% say they may move investments out of the country as a result. As Time's Michael Shuman recently wrote, a new Chinese Great Wall -- constructed of regulations and restrictions -- are making it harder for foreign companies to compete with domestic players in the Chinese consumer market. ""Things that were easy are less easy,"" Michael Dunne, president of the Hong Kong-based auto consultancy Dunne & Co., told Time, adding that carmakers ""have to work harder to get what they want. Free access is not part of the equation."" Still, more cash is trickling down to Chinese laborers. More than half of the country's growth last year ""has come from domestic consumption, and it's really because the government is pushing for more money to go into the pocket of everyday Chinese -- 21 of China's 31 provinces increased the minimum wage by 22%,"" Rein said. ""So what you're seeing is Chinese are getting wealthier, they're starting to spend more,"" he said. ""That's why you saw retail sales growth of 14.2% last month.""

"(CNN) -- Dutchman Edgar Davids has lifted the European Champions League trophy, won league titles in Italy and the Netherlands and played in a World Cup semifinal against Brazil in 1998. So why has a soccer star like Davids, who won 74 international caps for the Netherlands between 1994 and 2005, decided to become joint head coach of Barnet, who are currently rock bottom of the lowest tier of professional in England.

"(CNN) -- The Cy Young Award winners as Major League Baseball's best pitchers in 2012 couldn't be more different. In the American League, a young left-hander with a blazing fastball, entering the prime of his career, narrowly topped the 2011 recipient. In the National League, a 38-year-old knuckleballer with a mediocre track record until 2010 made his mark on history. Is baseball still the national pastime? The Tampa Bay Rays' David Price garnered just enough votes from the Baseball Writers' Association of America to win the AL prize. Price, 27, tied for the American League lead with 20 wins, against only five losses, and led the AL with a 2.56 earned run average. Both those marks were career bests for the former Vanderbilt University star, whom the Rays chose with the top pick in the entire 2007 amateur draft. Price also struck out 205 batters, sixth-most in the league. Price earned 14 first-place votes, 13 second-place votes and one third-place nod from the baseball scribes. That acclaim was just enough to edge 2011 AL Cy Young winner Justin Verlander, who picked up 13 first-place votes, 13 second-place votes and two third-place votes for his 17-8 won-lost record, his 2.64 ERA and his league-leading 239 strikeouts. The writers' association says the contest was the closest since writers first started listing more than one pitcher on their ballots in 1970. R.A. Dickey and the Zen of the knuckleball . Price's teammate, relief pitcher Fernando Rodney, garnered the final AL first-place vote and finished fifth in the overall AL voting, among nine pitchers who gained mention. Unlike Price, the New York Mets' R.A. Dickey dominated the competition in the NL Cy Young voting, just as he dominated from the mound this year. Dickey became the first knuckleball thrower to win the game's most prestigious individual pitching award, earning 27 first-place votes and five second-place votes for his historic season. Dickey went 20-6 with a 2.73 ERA, and his dancing pitches baffled a National League-leading 230 hitters. In addition, Dickey led the NL in innings pitched, complete games, and shutouts. Mirroring the AL, the 2011 NL Cy Young Award winner was this year's runner-up. Los Angeles Dodger Clayton Kershaw was rewarded for his outstanding season, which included a league-best 2.53 ERA and just one fewer strikeout than Dickey, with two first-place votes and second place overall. The Washington Nationals' Gio Gonzalez, the Cincinnati Reds' Johnny Cueto, and the Atlanta Braves' Craig Kimbrel each claimed one first-place nod.

"Madrid (CNN) -- Spaniards who are in ""circumstances of extreme necessity"" and are unable to pay their mortgages will not be evicted from their homes over the next two years, the main industry group for Spanish banks said Monday. The pledge comes just three days after a 53-year-old woman committed suicide as authorities were preparing to foreclose on her home. It was the second such incident since late October. The move will not halt all home evictions during the ongoing economic crisis, but the Spanish Banking Association issued a statement saying that ""due to social alarm generated by the home evictions,"" it agreed with a government proposal made last Thursday to halt foreclosures ""during the next two years, in those cases where there are circumstances of extreme necessity."" In the incident last Friday, the woman jumped to her death from her home in northern Spain as authorities were climbing the steps to evict her. The victim was a former Socialist town councilor. Her death followed the suicide last October 25 by a 53-year-old man who hanged himself at a home in southern Spain shortly before the eviction team -- judicial and bank representatives, backed by police -- showed up. There have been protests for months in Spain over evictions as the nation suffers a recession and an unemployment rate just over 25 percent. But the two suicides sharply increased pressure on Spanish authorities to take action. Spain's central judicial authority has reported than 150,000 evictions of Spaniards and immigrants from their homes since 2008, when the crisis started, for falling behind on their mortgage payments. Spain's El Pais newspaper reports the figure could be closer to 400,000. On Monday, a spokesman for the deputy prime minister told CNN it was not immediately clear how many evictions would be stopped under the banking industry's standard of ""circumstances of extreme necessity"" but he said it could be ""some thousands."" Housing advocates say hundreds of evictions are scheduled every business day. The banking association says 97% of homeowners are still paying their mortgages on time. Just hours after the second suicide last Friday, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy told a regional election rally that the government ""will protect the most vulnerable families affected by evictions."" Leading judges -- the judiciary is charged with carrying out the evictions -- have in recent days called on lawmakers to urgently address the problem. And a main police union, known by its letters SUP, offered to pay legal fees and lost wages for officers who decline to participate in evictions. The conservative government and the main opposition Socialist Party -- after months of being unable to agree on almost anything -- have suddenly pledged to work together to ease the foreclosures. A senior Economy Ministry official and his counterpart from the Socialist Party were to meet later Monday to discuss other measures to ease the eviction crisis. Credit was cheap in Spain during the boom years, when hundreds of thousands of new homes were built and it seemed that everyone could become a homeowner. The boom went bust in 2008, and banks incurred huge debts from bad real estate loans while the economy slowed, the jobless rate increased, and consumer spending stalled. There have been widespread protests against the evictions and especially against the Spanish law that lets banks seize not only the property but also go after debtors' future income until everything has been paid back. At numerous evictions, authorities have been met by dozens of protesters who have organized to provide support for families facing evictions across the country.","The main industry group for Spanish banks announces a moratorium on some evictions .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed solidarity with Greece Tuesday on a trip to Athens, even as tens of thousands of Greeks rallied to show their anger toward her over the hardship their country is suffering. Critics see Merkel as the main enforcer of the European Union-imposed austerity measures that have left a large number of Greeks unemployed and streaming to soup kitchens for a hot meal. Police estimated that as many as 25,000 people turned out to demonstrate in central Athens, despite a ban on protests in certain areas amid beefed-up security for Merkel's six-hour stay. Merkel, who was making her first visit to Athens in several years, spoke of Greece as a partner and a friend to Germany as she addressed reporters with Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras. Merkel noted that Greece was going through a ""very difficult phase"" in which many people were suffering, but she insisted the debt-stricken nation had made progress in reducing its deficit and passing reforms. ""It's for this reason that I would like to say that a huge part of the journey has already been accomplished,"" she said. ""Germany and Greece are going to work very closely together,"" she added, as fellow members of Europe and the euro single currency. Thousands protest austerity measures in Greece . Samaras, whose coalition government is seeking new ways to implement budget cuts of 11.5 billion euros ($14.49 billion) to ensure the country receives another international bailout installment this month, also stressed the strong ties between the two nations. ""The Greeks are proud and they know how to show support for their friends, and we welcome a friend here today,"" Samaras said of Merkel. Greece would show those speculators who had wagered on its collapse and exit from the eurozone that they were wrong, he said. Greek President Karolos Papoulias also welcomed Merkel's visit at what he said was a very difficult time for his people. ""They have nearly exhausted how much they can take. And of course we need to think of measures that will give hope to these people that are suffering,"" he said. Those measures must include steps to boost growth and create jobs for young people and women, he told the German chancellor. Merkel and Samaras met with Greek and German business leaders following their joint news conference. The crowds of protesters who gathered in Syntagma Square, by the Greek parliament building, had largely dispersed by Tuesday evening. Earlier, a number of people were arrested after objects were thrown at riot police. Many protesters, some of whom belong to labor unions and Syriza, the radical-left opposition party, carried anti-Merkel banners. ""Merkel we are a free nation and not your colony,"" said one banner. Another read, ""Merkel Raus (out, in German). Murderer of 3,500 Greeks,"" a reference to the number of Greeks who have taken their own lives, according to some estimates, as a result of the current hardship. Before her visit, Merkel told CNN she knows the austerity measures have been hard on some. ""It's very bitter obviously, sacrifices need to be made,"" she said. ""But I think these are necessary measures that have to be taken, I think it was not easy for anyone to impose those measures on them, but these, I think, have been made on the background of great experience."" Analysts say that for Merkel, who faces a general election next year, the Athens trip also sends a message back home that she views Greece as an integral part of Europe. While some within her own governing coalition have spoken of the need for contingency plans for a possible Greek exit from the euro, Merkel has signaled that she would view that outcome as extremely risky. However, many German taxpayers are opposed to committing more European funds to Greece. In return for international bailout funds, Greece has agreed to the austerity program and labor market reforms -- measures that have led to violent street demonstrations in the past. Speaking in Syntagma Square, Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras said Merkel had come to Athens in support of Samaras and his ministers ""while the people are on their knees ahead of new, barbaric measures."" But, he said, her visit would allow the Greek people to send a message to the rest of Europe that they were stronger than those supporting the bankers and bailouts. ""The democratic tradition of Europe will not allow a European people, the Greek people, to be transformed into a crisis 'guinea pig' and for Greece to become a vast social cemetery. We will win in the end, because we are right and we are many,"" he said. To comply with the belt-tightening measures, salaries have been cut for many workers in Greece, pensions and benefits have been slashed, and unemployment rates have soared. As of May, 53.8% of Greeks younger than 25 were unemployed, according to Eurostat, the statistics division of the European Commission. A number of those who demonstrated in Athens on Tuesday said it was the first time they had taken to the streets to protest the economic crisis -- a reflection, perhaps, of how widely the anger over austerity is now felt. Many of the protesters were retirees, a group that has lost, in many cases, more than 30% of its income since the crisis hit. Retirees are also among the groups that will be most affected by the new measures to which Greece must agree in order to receive the next tranche of its international bailout loan. Maria Kirioni, a 53-year-old civil servant, told CNN she was protesting for the first time since she was a university student. ""Merkel does not know what is going on in Greece. She only hears the politicians' voices. We must show her. It would be better if she stayed longer to see the reality,"" Kirioni said. Stella Gianakopoulou, a 56-year-old schoolteacher who lived in Wupertal, Germany, for 18 years, said: ""Merkel will cause the eruption of Greek society, and then this will spread throughout southern Europe. This may lead to a eurozone collapse."" But Rafael Voulgarakis, a university student, welcomed the German chancellor's visit. ""It is clearly positive, because as we know, Germany is the largest power in Europe at the moment and one of the largest powers in the world,"" he said. ""It is clear that the support of Ms. Merkel is good for our country and is needed."" CNN iReporter Margaret Roesler, from Minnesota, saw the buildup to the protest. ""It seemed like a fairly tense atmosphere,"" she said. ""The main road near our apartment was absolutely deserted, seems like everything shut down for the day. Someone told us to use extreme caution and to leave as soon as possible, which we did."" German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle told Bild newspaper last week that Greece deserves ""fairness and respect."" He suggested that Merkel's visit represents a show of eurozone solidarity between nations that are fiscally healthy and those that are debt-ridden and battling savage cuts and social unrest. Christoph Weil, a senior economist at Commerzbank, told CNN that Merkel's visit to Athens comes as a ""surprise"" and that there was ""a significant risk that Greece will exit the euro in the next two years."" However, Wolfango Piccoli, director of Eurasia Group, says that the risk of a Greek exit from the eurozone remains ""marginal"" at the moment and that the so-called troika -- the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund -- will provide Greece with the next tranche of bailout funds to meet its debt obligations.

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Belize are trying to find and talk to Internet antivirus pioneer John McAfee about a fatal shooting in the Central American nation, a police spokesman said Monday. ""He is wanted for questioning in the murder of Gregory Faull, and we are still seeking him,"" said Raphael Martinez, a national police spokesman. A housekeeper discovered Faull's body in a hallway of his home with a gunshot wound to the back of his head, according to Martinez and a notice on the national police's website. Police later arrived at the home north of San Pedro, on the Caribbean island of Ambergris Caye, and found the 52-year-old Faull ""lying face-up in a pool of blood,"" according to the police website. Police later found a 9mm shell at the bottom of stairs near Faull. Accounts differ as to when this took place. Martinez said Faull, who lived alone near McAfee, was found Saturday morning. The police website, meanwhile, states the body was found around 8 a.m. Sunday and that Faull was last seen alive around 10 p.m. Saturday. Authorities investigating the homicide are speaking to another person as they pursue multiple leads, said Martinez. A laptop computer and cell phone are missing from Faull's home. According to the spokesman, police have not established a motive in the killing. McAfee left his namesake Internet security firm in 1994 and has not been affiliated with the firm since then, said company spokeswoman Kimberly Eichorn. Citing its policy not to comment on former employees, Eichorn did not comment on the case. CNN could not determine McAfee's current whereabouts or whether he has a lawyer. According to a story on Wired magazine's website, McAfee said regarding Faull's death that he knew ""nothing, other than I heard he had been shot."" McAfee told Wired that he's been at odds with Belizean authorities for months, adding that he's hiding from them somewhere in the country. According to his alma mater, Roanoke College, McAfee graduated from that Virginia school in 1967 as a mathematics major. He went on to found several tech companies and launch groundbreaking products, including a voice recognition system Interpath in 1981, McAfee in 1988, and the instant messaging pioneer Tribal Voice in 1996.

"(CNN) -- When a band spends as much time as the Gym Class Heroes has gaining momentum on the indie scene only to suddenly take off, there is always concern of selling out. Yet the group has defied expectations by topping the mainstream charts while still holding on to its independent cred. The Gym Class Heroes self-released their first album in 2001, and with 11 years and five albums now under their belt, they show no signs of slowing down. The band's latest, ""The Papercut Chronicles II,"" hit shelves last November and has produced three hit singles. ""Stereo Hearts,"" a collaboration with Maroon 5 singer Adam Levine, became one of the biggest songs of 2011, and it was even covered by the kids of McKinley High in the hit Fox series, ""Glee."" The followup cut featuring UK singer Neon Hitch, ""Get Yourself Back Home,"" became the band's third Top 15 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. ""The Fighter"" is the Heroes' latest single, and it finds them working with hit songwriter and One Republic singer Ryan Tedder. The inspiring track got a number of plays during NBC's coverage of the summer Olympic Games, and the video follows Olympic gymnast John Orozco as he trained for the London events. Frontman Travie McCoy is quick to point out that all of their collaborations are more than name-dropping afterthoughts. ""The collaborations that we do are with artists that we feel fit on the song or can add something special to that particular song,"" he said. ""It's never, ever been for namesake. The fact that we can even ... [that] we have the chance to reach out to artists that we look up to is amazing."" McCoy believes his band has fought hard to get this far, and they've learned never let anything get in their way of putting on a good show. ""I think coming up the way we did, playing shows in front of crowds that weren't necessarily there to see us ... we made sure that the 35 to 40 minutes that we had of their time, that they had a good time,"" he said. The Gym Class Heroes broke through to the mainstream with the catchy 2007 hit ""Cupid's Chokehold"" from their third album, ""The Papercut Chronicles."" McCoy revealed how their latest became that record's sequel. ""I feel like the new record chronicles from the time we put that album out until now, like having hit records, working with artists that we look up to, touring the world, becoming fathers, getting married."" McCoy is aware of criticism the band may receive from fans they've had since their debut, but he doesn't let that stand in the way of moving onward and upward. ""We dealt with a lot of negativity and negative feedback from fans because we did shows with anyone who would let us be with them. We took it all in stride and stayed doing what we do...I can't see myself giving this up anytime soon.""","Gym Class Heroes has gone mainstream while keeping an indie cred .

"(CNN) -- The spiraling scandal that took down David Petraeus has apparently ensnared another powerful general, as authorities announced that Gen. John Allen is under investigation for allegedly sending inappropriate messages to Jill Kelley, a woman who has been linked to the Petraeus scandal. Allen, who is the commander of NATO's International Security Assistance Force, has denied any wrongdoing, a senior defense official said. Details of the latest angle of the scandal that has shaken the highest level of the military were sketchy early Tuesday morning. Timeline of the Petraeus affair . Some details about Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, came from a terse overnight statement by Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. ""On Sunday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation referred to the Department of Defense a matter involving General John Allen, Commander of the International Security Assistance Force (or ISAF) in Afghanistan,"" part of the statement said. ""Today, the secretary directed that the matter be referred to the Inspector General of the Department of Defense for investigation."" A defense official told CNN there is a ""distinct possibility"" that the investigation into Allen is connected to the investigation that led to the resignation of Petraeus. Allen will still retain his position as the commander of ISAF as the investigation continues, the Pentagon said. But Panetta asked that Allen's nomination to become NATO's supreme allied commander be put on hold, the statement said. The confirmation hearing to see if Allen would get that lofty military post was scheduled for Thursday. Rep. King: Petraeus' resignation doesn't preclude testimony . The investigation was in its early stages but authorities were looking into some 20,000 to 30,000 pages of documents, the defense official said. It was not immediately clear Tuesday exactly how Allen may be linked to the Petraeus investigation. Petraeus, 60, resigned Friday after acknowledging he had an affair with a woman later identified as his biographer, Paula Broadwell, 40, a fellow West Point graduate who spent months studying the general's leadership of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The investigation into Petraeus came to light during an FBI investigation of ""jealous"" e-mails reportedly sent by Broadwell to a woman named Jill Kelley, a government source familiar with the investigation told CNN on Monday. Now authorities say Allen was under investigation because of communications with Kelley. Amid national talk about the Petraeus scandal, Kelley, 37, and her husband released a statement saying they have been friends with Petraeus and his family for more than five years and asked for privacy.

"(CNN) -- Michelin North America, Inc., announced Thursday it is voluntarily recalling about 841,000 of its BFGoodrich and Uniroyal tires because tread-belt separation may cause them to lose tread and/or deflate quickly. Though no deaths or injuries have been reported related to the recalled tires, ""a small number of the tires"" have experienced tread loss, the company said in a news release. ""This condition may increase the risk of a vehicle crash,"" said Mike Wischhusen, Michelin's technical director, in a letter to tire owners. The tires typically are mounted on commercial light trucks and full-size, heavy-duty vans, though some people may have bought them as replacement tires for their personal vehicles. ""It is important that all recalled tires be removed from service as soon as possible,"" Wischhusen said in the letter, which urges consumers to visit their BFGoodrich retailer to have them replaced without charge. About 799,900 of the tires were sold in the United States; the others were sold in Canada and Mexico, the company said. Customers returned 0.017% of the tires -- representing about 143 tires in all -- for tread and/or air loss, the company said. The recalled tires are BFGoodrich commercial tires LT 235/85 R16 120 Q LRE and LT 245/75 R16 120 Q LRE, and Uniroyal Laredo tires LT 235/85 R16 120 Q LRE and LT 245/75 R16 120 Q LRE.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- There is only one thing that Chinese and foreign observers of China are looking for at the 18th Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Congress: signs of reform, especially political liberalization. The chances of meaningful political changes, or those that dovetail with global norms, however, are getting increasingly slim. The reason may be simple. Until around about the time of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, to reform or not to reform belonged in the realm of ideology. Even before the birth of the People's Republic in 1949, factions within the party had fought over the future direction of the country. When Mao Zedong was running the show, there was the celebrated ""struggle between two lines."" This referred to the fierce competition between the Maoists -- who claimed to uphold unadulterated Marxism -- and the ""capitalist roaders,"" led by then-president Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping. After the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), Deng, the Great Architect of Reform, battled furiously with conservative patriarch Chen Yun, who only wanted ""[market-oriented] reform within a bird-cage."" In the run-up to the June 4, 1989 massacre, Deng, who was paranoid about China succumbing to the winds of change that were sweeping Eastern Europe, mobilized the troops to torpedo the Westernized political reforms championed by the liberal General Secretary Zhao Ziyang. Since the early 1990s, three major factions have emerged within the party: the Shanghai faction led by ex-president Jiang Zemin, the Communist Youth League (CYL) faction led by President Hu Jintao, and the ""Gang of Princelings"" -- a reference to the offspring of party elders -- led by president-in-waiting Xi Jinping. Despite their apparent differences, these factions have come to a solid consensus on the major goals of the country. Politically, the CCP must preserve its near-total monopoly on power. And while aspects of the economy are being integrated with the global marketplace, about 120 yangqi or centrally-held enterprises will continue to enjoy monopolies over key sectors, ranging from oil and gas to banking and telecommunications. Moreover, an unprecedented number of the spouses and children of party elders have gone into business. Some have become the yangqi's senior managers. Even more have used their sterling political connections to start highly successful private businesses in lucrative areas such as finance and real estate. These so-called ""red capitalists"" are evenly represented by members of the party major factions. Critics of the government do not seem to be exaggerating when they say that 100 or so of the biggest clans that represent the country's ""red aristocracy"" control the largest chunk of the economy. The official China Daily has reported that the top 1% of Chinese families owns 41.4% of the nation's wealth, while a survey by the People's Daily indicated that 91% of respondents thought the ""nouveau riche"" in China had benefited from their political ties to the CCP leadership. Reform has become nigh impossible because any change of the political or economic status quo will threaten the vested interests -- and finances and earnings -- of these near-omnipotent CCP clans. Politburo member and Guangdong Province Party Secretary Wang Yang admitted this earlier this year. ""At the early stage of reform, the obstacles [to liberalization] were mainly due to ideological differences,"" he said. ""Now, the major problems faced by reform come from the configuration of interest groups [at the top]."" It is most unlikely that the fifth-generation leadership under General Secretary-in-waiting Xi Jinping will change the rules of the game. While Xi, 59, has the reputation of ""Mr. Clean,"" his siblings are multi-millionaires who have substantial investments in China and Hong Kong. Quite a few of the members of the new CCP Politburo Standing Committee (PBSC) -- China's highest ruling council -- to be confirmed at the November congress are representatives of China's big clans. They include the Vice-Premier Wang Qishan, Head of the Propaganda Department Liu Yunshan, and Vice-Premier and Chongqing Party Chief, Zhang Dejiang. Owing to the rigidity of China's one-party authoritarian rule -- as well as the political elite's determination to uphold the status quo -- expectations of any kind of reform and liberalization have fallen to new lows among the Chinese intelligentsia as well as ordinary folk. Even though China watchers in the West are paying close attention to who will be inducted into the Politburo and the PBSC, Beijing's largely apathetic political pundits are seized by a feeling of plus ca change -- the more things change, the more they stay the same. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Willy Lam.","Chance of meaningful reform from China's new leaders is slim .
Different factions have reached consensus on major national goals .
An unprecedented number of relatives of party elders have gone into business .

"(CNN) -- ""The future as a Rolling Stone is very uncertain. My ultimate aim in life was never to be a pop star. I enjoy it with reservations, but I'm not really, sort of, satisfied either artistically or personally with it."" Brian Jones' candid words in the first Rolling Stones documentary, 1965's ""Charlie is My Darling,"" are all the more poignant because the guitarist did, in fact, part ways with the band in 1969. He drowned later that year. The Rolling Stones played four gigs over two days in Ireland in September of '65. On the heels of the success of The Beatles' ""A Hard Days Night,"" the Stones' then-manager, Andrew Loog Oldham, asked director Peter Whitehead to film the band. The result was ""Charlie is my Darling,"" a film that was never officially released -- until now. Rumors of the film's existence was the stuff of Stones' fan folklore as the film reels sat untouched, gathering moss for four decades. At a pivotal point in their careers . The Stones are celebrating their 50th anniversary, and ""Charlie is My Darling"" captures the band at that pivotal point in their careers where they were right on the cusp of superstardom. ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" had just reached No. 1 on the charts. Lead singer Mick Jagger, guitarist and vocalist Keith Richards, drummer Charlie Watts, Jones and bass guitarist Bill Wyman were famous, but had yet to become rock superstars. The original film was only shown in a few theaters in 1966 before being shelved, but ABKCO Music & Records uncovered unused footage and teamed up with filmmakers Mick Gochanour and Robin Klein to restore and re-edit ""Charlie is My Darling"" as a new film. The DVD/Blu-ray was released earlier this month. The Rolling Stones play impromptu gig . Gochanour and Klein had been aware of the project since 1965. They had tried to bring it to life in the 1990s, but the technology wasn't quite there yet. With miles of material to sift through and footage in tatters, the project was put on an indefinite hiatus until last year, when Gochanour and Klein stumbled upon footage of The Rolling Stones on stage that they didn't even know existed. A meticulous process unfolds . The painstaking restoration process was both time- and labor-intensive. It wasn't uncommon to have to stop everything to mend the film by hand because of a splice or torn sprocket breaking in the film scanner. It took two days to scan one reel of film, which contained 30,000 to 40,000 frames per reel. With 35 cans to be scanned, they spent several months matching sources and repairing tears, scratches and chemical blotches by hand. After that initial frame-by-frame scanning, there was a grading process that brought the various disparate elements a little closer to being in balance, matching grain and tone. When all was said and done, over 90,000 individual frames were restored by hand. In addition, the many separate parts they were working with had to be balanced -- grain and tone had to be matched to convey the uniformity of being part of the same work. And that was just the picture portion of the film -- synching audio and video was a whole other beast of burden. ""There were many issues and challenges we were dealing with,"" Gochanour told CNN, ""not the least of which was the audio. Since it was not shot as a concert film, there were no logs or documentation."" Gochanour and Klein spent eight months on the performances alone. ""It was a meticulous, painstaking process of looking for clues,"" said Klein. ""An on-camera word, a gesture, the tempo, guitar chords. The amazing thing is -- and every fan should appreciate this -- we sometimes had three versions of a song and every version would drop in against picture and could be matched up. That is a testament to the lockstep nature of Charlie and Bill. And also Mick, particularly the spoken word sections. The cadence is nearly always the same. He breaks the line up in the same way every time; he breathes at the same place. Many of his gestures remain to this day. He still hits his knee when he sings 'Time Is on My Side' and slaps the air during 'Satisfaction'."" Gochanour recalled finding the earliest existing footage of a live performance of ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction."" ""I get chills to this day remembering what it was like to see 'Satisfaction' with sound and picture for the first time,"" he said. ""It was like finding a Picasso in grandma's attic. It was a revelation. I had no idea how raw and visceral they were; how incredibly tight and controlled at the same time. There was a punk attitude -- a direct communication."" A young Mick Jagger's swagger . In the film, a then 22-year-old Mick Jagger was interviewed. Still in his formative stages as a performer -- he hadn't quite perfected the moves like Jagger -- the rock legend did exude a keen sense of self-awareness. ""Most successful entertainers have always been the most egotistical ones -- on stage,"" he said. ""They might not be as egotistical as that offstage, but all that ego is got rid of onstage."" When asked what sort of person he was offstage, Jagger remarked, ""about half as egotistical."" Dispersed throughout the interviews are concert footage of entire performances of other early Stones hits such as ""Time Is on My Side"" and ""The Last Time."" ""I don't really know what I am on stage,"" Jagger continued. ""It's very different because you have to treat everybody differently. You have to be very, very, very egotistical because that's -- I mean, you're acting. You're doing an act for them. It's not really you."" Jagger also said that when the band's first record hit the charts, he was convinced that The Rolling Stones would ""probably be around for a year or maybe a year and a half, and then it's all going to be over."" Rocking the Irish countryside . The band can also be seen traveling through the Irish countryside in a train car ordering tea with ""lots of sugar,"" being mobbed by fans, hanging out backstage and tinkering with songs in shabby hotel rooms. Jagger and Richards were in the midst of writing ""Sittin' on a Fence"" in one scene. That song wasn't formally recorded for another three months. Although the band was still finding its musical footing at the time, Jagger's disdain for the pop music of his own youth provides a glimpse into what was to become of the band. ""Popular music wasn't a real thing at all,"" said Jagger. ""It was very, very romantic"" with lyrics ""about things that don't really happen ... very few of them actually mean anything or have any relation to what people are doing. ... They were just about being unhappy because your girl had left you, or being happy because you just met somebody. That's all they were about about. The moon in June and the sky is blue, I love you."" Jagger also talked about 1960s society and how the times, they were a-changin'. ""In the last two or three years,"" he said, ""young people have been -- this especially applies to America -- instead of just carrying on the way their parents told them to, they've started a big thing where they're anti-war and they love everybody and their sexual lives have become freer. The kids are looking for something else, some different moral value because they know they're gonna get all the things that were thought impossible 50 years ago. A whole sort of basis of society and values which were accepted could be changed, but it's up to them to carry on those ideals that they have instead of just falling into the same old routine that their parents have fallen into. So it's not until the people of 21 now reach the age of 75 -- those kids actually have to be grandfathers before the whole thing is changed."" In one of the most entertaining parts of the film, Jagger and Richards sing the tunes of their rivals -- The Beatles' ""Eight Days a Week"" and ""I've Just Seen a Face."" Jagger also does an impressive Elvis Presley impersonation. What they wanted to be when they grew up . Toward the end of the film, some of the band mates talked about their post-rock 'n roll life plans. Jones said he always wanted to be a filmmaker, Jagger considered going back to college, and Watts planned to go back to his former career as a graphic designer. But as it turned out, the Stones did not fade away. Incidentally, the film's title is a reference to Watts. ""His was the personality that everyone felt was the most endearing -- and cinematic,"" said Gochanour. Gochanour also explained the differences between the 1965 and 2012 versions of ""Charlie is My Darling."" He said he tried to ""give the audience a sense of what it was like to be at one of the shows when the band was just coming into their own. I was also trying to show the early effects of fame and notoriety -- and foreshadow the future."" Peter Whitehead's 35-minute 1965 version, on the other hand, is more of an exploration of the band mates' differing personalities. Gochanour, however, retained the original title because of the film's cult status among Stones fans. He and Klein distinguished this new, 67-minute version by version by adding ""Ireland 1965"" to the name; thus the new release is formally titled ""Charlie is My Darling: Ireland 1965."" As The Rolling Stones celebrate the half-century mark as a band, a rare look at its members when they hadn't yet hit the quarter-century mark as people really puts their resonating success in perspective. At one point, the interviewer asked Jagger what the secret to his success was. ""There isn't any secret,"" he said. ""It's all very obvious.""

"CNN justice producer Terry Frieden was part of the first-ever media tour of the U.S. Bureau of Prison's Administrative Maximum prison -- also known as ""Supermax."" What follows is Frieden's account of his experience. A file photo of the SuperMax prison taken when the facility opened 13 years ago. FLORENCE, Colorado (CNN)  -- Visiting Supermax, the ""Alcatraz of the Rockies,"" reveals nothing so much as an astonishing and eerie quiet. It's not what one would expect of a place that houses 473 notorious terrorists, vicious murderers and violent, disruptive escape-prone inmates brought in from other federal penitentiaries. I've visited noisy, boisterous state and federal prisons, where inmates scream for a visitor's attention or proclaim their innocence. But at Supermax -- officially called ""Administrative Maximum,"" or ADX -- everything is very tightly controlled, with nothing left to chance, so there is no particular sense of a threat, no feeling of vulnerability.  View an explainer of Supermax's security » . Corrections officials were blunt in explaining their reason for finally inviting reporters, albeit without cameras, to peek behind the heavy metal gates for the first time since the penitentiary opened 13 years ago. ""This is about dispelling myths and rumors,"" said Warden Ron Wiley. Myths that particularly rile prison officials are reports that Supermax, southwest of Colorado Springs, is a dungeon where inmates are cast aside to rot and die, and that the prison is underground, which it obviously is not.  View a map of Supermax's location » . The first hint of the level of control throughout Supermax is the cumbersome, time-consuming security procedures we visitors (already cleared for admittance) were subjected to. I expect metal detectors these days, but despite possessing my Justice Department-issued photo ID, I still had to be photographed by the Bureau of Prisons, which is part of the Justice Department. Even Bureau of Prisons executives had to display their credentials to guards time and time again. Prison officials also have been bugged by rumors that the penitentiary was not entirely safe and secure, and that the lack of adequate staffing and a perimeter fence were potential problems to the community. Bureau officials insist allegations of inadequate security were fueled by corrections labor unions wanting more staffing, but complaints caught the attention of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and Colorado Sens. Ken Salazar and Wayne Allard, all of whom visited. In the end, it was agreed that a $10 million perimeter fence wasn't needed. The handful of journalists allowed in were not allowed to see the headline-grabbing terrorists isolated under specially designed procedures. We didn't get a glimpse of Zacharias Moussaoui, Ramzi Yousef, Richard Reid, Theodore Kaczynski or Terry Nichols. But we've seen them in court, and they're not the guys you'd most fear. All the attention paid to the few most infamous prisoners distorts the reality of ADX, officials insist. ""They're like the premier players of the NBA. They get all the attention,"" Wiley complained. Bureau of Prisons officials stressed that 95 percent of the Supermax prisoners are the most violent, disruptive and escape-prone inmates from other federal prisons, and they were transferred to ADX to help control those other facilities. At ADX, every prisoner has his own 86-square-foot cell. Despite the brutal nature and violent history of most of the inmates, not a single major assault against a corrections officer has occurred since the first inmates arrived in 1994. The one-on-one killers who slashed or strangled other inmates, earning a trip to Supermax, are the inmates one would most worry about. Contact with others comes only after the inmates have adhered to a strict program for group recreation. Two inmate-on-inmate homicides have led to even tighter restrictions. I was allowed to briefly talk at random to a few of the inmates. One man who identified himself as Jack Stancell of South Carolina told me he's doing time because, among other things, he'd stabbed somebody and murdered somebody else. He's been in prison for 33 of his 65 years. He says Supermax is actually better than some places he's been. ""You get used to it,"" he says without emotion. As I walk into the outdoor recreation area, it's evident that virtually every possibility in combating the criminal mind has been considered. Large cables are strung above the basketball courts and track for no apparent reason. ""Those are helicopter deterrents,"" a corrections official explains. ""We are not really worried about a chopper escape attempt, but you've got to be prepared."" In the prison library, where inmates most ask for Westerns and romance novels, employees scour pages of returned books just to make sure there's not a message or code that could be passed along to another inmate. Nothing's left to chance.

"London (CNN) -- It has often been said that the European Union is the most ambitious conflict management project ever undertaken. Over the past sixty years, it has certainly transformed the ways in which the peoples and countries of Europe work with one another. For example, the idea that force -- or even the threat of force -- could ever be used as a means of dealing with problems is simply unthinkable. It is this change in the very way that Europeans think about each other that has been recognized by the Nobel Committee. Peace Prize is slap on the back for a struggling European Union . However, looking beyond the example of Franco-German reconciliation, and the reunification of East and West Europe after the end of the Cold War, many wonder whether the European Union has managed to bring about as much peace and stability as is generally supposed. In some cases, the verdict is clearly positive. In Northern Ireland, for example, the European Union has certainly helped to lessen tensions and create a more peaceful situation. Although fundamental differences remain over sovereignty, the EU has played an instrumental role in creating conditions whereby the day to day elements of territorial division are less important than ever before. Meanwhile, over in the Eastern Mediterranean, the European Union played a key role -- albeit indirectly -- in creating the conditions for a rapprochement between Greece and Turkey; a process that still continues even though Turkish membership now appears distant. This too is an important success. Elsewhere, though, the picture is rather less positive. In the case of Cyprus, the EU certainly provided the impetus for conflict resolution. By announcing its commitment to admit a divided Cyprus, the Union forced Turkey and the then Turkish Cypriot leadership to adopt a more constructive approach to reunification talks than had previously been the case. The problem was that the EU failed to create safeguards to ensure that the Greek Cypriots would also play ball. This has come to be been seen by many as a major failing. Cyprus is still unresolved after almost a decade of EU membership. But it is in the Balkans that the award has been greeted with the greatest degree of skepticism. From the moment the news first broke, people from the region have responded with incredulity. Many have pointed out the negative role played the Union in the region in the 1990s. By failing to take a united position at the very earliest stages of the crisis, the EU is widely seen to have contributed to the bloody events that followed. At the same time, its failure to respond more decisively to the conflict once it had broken out is seen by many to have cost tens of thousands of lives. Meanwhile, looking to the present, the European Union is still felt by many on the region to be falling short well short of its lofty ideals. Although EU officials insist that the Union is still keen to enlarge, and will eventually include the countries of the Western Balkans, in reality many believe that it is not committed to doing so. This is now feeding renewed fears of instability. Reconciliation and cooperation has, for better or for worse, been driven by a sense that the region is moving towards the European Union membership. Without that perspective, there are fears that the countries may slide back into nationalism. Looked at from the perspective of most of the continent, the award is richly deserved. Countries with a long history of conflict now live together in peace. However, in one corner of Europe, there are many who are less willing to cheer the decision of the committee. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Ker-Lindsay .","The EU is often seen as most ambitious conflict management project ever undertaken .

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney promised Monday to restore U.S. foreign policy to a traditional role dating back decades, based on exerting global influence through military and economic power, in a major speech two weeks before he debates President Barack Obama on international issues. In the address at the Virginia Military Institute, Romney argued that Obama is failing to provide the global leadership needed and expected by the rest of the world, especially key allies such as Israel. Romney cited recent protests and violence in Arab countries, including an attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Libya that killed the American ambassador and three others, as examples of a worsening security situation that he blamed on Obama's policies. ""It is our responsibility and the responsibility of our president to use America's great power to shape history â€” not to lead from behind, leaving our destiny at the mercy of events,"" the Republican presidential nominee said, after earlier declaring that ""unfortunately, this president's policies have not been equal to our best examples of world leadership and nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East."" Poll shows Romney tied with Obama after debate . Romney's running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, offered a similar criticism on Monday at a campaign appearance in Ohio. ""If you look around the world, what we are witnessing is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy,"" the conservative House Budget Committee chairman said, later adding that ""if we project weakness abroad, our adversaries are that much more willing to test us, to question our resolve."" In response to Romney's speech, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that the GOP candidate's positions are in most cases similar to Obama's policies, while former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright accused Romney of repeatedly shifting his views. ""I watched the speech with great interest trying to figure out what Governor Romney's policies really are,"" Albright said on a conference call with reporters set up by the Obama campaign. ""This is, I think, the seventh speech he has given on foreign policy over the years, but I think I have come out more confused because he has changed his mind on a number of different issues."" In specific policy examples, Romney called for the United States to join allies in ensuring that rebels fighting government forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad get the military hardware they seek. However, he stopped short of calls by some conservatives for Washington to directly arm the rebels. ""In Syria, I will work with our partners to identify and organize those members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat Assad's tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets,"" Romney said. He noted that Iran is sending weaponry to Assad's forces ""because they know his downfall would be a strategic defeat for them."" ""We should be working no less vigorously through our international partners to support the many Syrians who would deliver that defeat to Iran -- rather than sitting on the sidelines,"" Romney said, making a change from the advance text of the speech that originally called for working ""with"" international partners. ""It is essential that we develop influence with those forces in Syria that will one day lead a country that sits at the heart of the Middle East."" The Obama administration has limited direct aid so far to non-lethal support such as communications equipment. In addition, the United States is vetting rebels and working with Qatar and Saudi Arabia to make sure weapons go to preferred groups. Obama ad: Romney is 'reckless' with foreign policy . Administration officials have expressed concern about giving weapons to unvetted rebels for fear that the arms could fall into the hands of terrorists. Romney also criticized Obama's overall approach to the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He argued that last month's attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans ""should not be seen as random."" Instead, Romney said the violence ""was likely the work of the same forces affiliated with those that attacked our homeland on September 11th, 2001,"" making a change from excerpts released in advance that described the attackers as likely the same forces from 9//11. The recent assault in Benghazi, which took place on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington by al Qaeda, is under investigation by U.S. officials, with no formal word yet on exactly who was behind it. In the United States, the intelligence community believes it was ""a deliberate and organized terrorist assault carried out by extremists"" affiliated with or sympathetic to al Qaeda. The Obama administration has been criticized for initially blaming the attack on protests over an anti-Islam film produced in the United States, then acknowledging it was a terrorist attack. Mitt's middle of the road makeover . While Romney sought to distinguish himself from Obama on foreign policy, specific proposals he cited remained similar to what the administration is doing. For example, he called for ending military operations in Afghanistan by the end of the 2014, the same date set by Obama and NATO, and warned of unspecified steps to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. Obama has said all options remain on the table for preventing an Iranian nuclear weapon. In one distinction, Romney said Monday that under his leadership, ""the United States and our friends and allies will prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons capability,"" which differs from Obama's pledge to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Nuclear capability refers to the process of being able to develop a nuclear weapon -- a lower threshold than Obama's reference -- and Romney's language matched that of his former business colleague, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on the issue. Polls show Obama gets higher marks than Romney on foreign policy, and the former Massachusetts governor hurt his international credentials on a three-nation trip this summer that included a high-profile gaffe in which he questioned London's preparedness to host the Olympics. Full remarks: Romney foreign policy speech . Romney also angered Palestinian leaders with a reference to cultural differences as a reason for differing levels of prosperity between Israel and the Palestinian territories. In addition, a secretly recorded video of a private campaign event in May showed Romney casting doubt on the possibility of reaching a two-state solution in the Middle East with independent Israeli and Palestinian states. On Monday, Romney pledged to recommit his administration to seeking the two-state solution and blamed Obama for what he called a negotiation process that has ""devolved into a series of heated disputes at the United Nations."" ""In this old conflict, as in every challenge we face in the Middle East, only a new president will bring the chance to begin anew,"" Romney said. ""I know the president hopes for a safer, freer, and a more prosperous Middle East allied with the United States. I share this hope,"" he said.""But hope is not a strategy."" Undecided: What will sway them? Romney also has faced negative headlines over his quick response to the Benghazi consulate attack. Soon after word broke of the violence, he fired off a statement that was criticized as inaccurate and premature. Seeking to remind voters of Romney's past gaffes, the Obama campaign released a new ad in Virginia, a battleground in the November 6 election, that characterized the Republican challenger as ""reckless"" and ""amateurish"" on international affairs. The 30-second spot features news clips of what the commercial calls Romney's ""gaffe-filled"" trip to England, Israel and Poland. ""If this is how he handles the world now,"" the narrator in the new ad says, ""just think what Mitt Romney might do as president."" Responding to the ad, a Romney campaign spokeswoman said Obama was the one who had ""weakened"" the U.S. standing in the world. Obama's mixed week . On Sunday, Romney foreign policy director Alex Wong told reporters that the candidate's foreign policy seeks the traditional U.S. role in global affairs dating to the end of World War II. ""Mitt Romney's vision is to restore influence and to support our friends and allies to move the Middle East onto a path of greater liberty, greater stability, and greater prosperity,"" Wong said. ""It's a restoration of a strategy that served us well for over 70 years."" What would you ask Biden, Ryan? Referring to the U.S. perspective after World War II, Wong said that ""we saw the need to have a military that no one would challenge."" He also cited the need to have strategic allies around the world as part of what he called a full spectrum of power ""so we do not have to face again the horrors of war."" Romney and Obama will debate foreign policy on October 22 in Florida following their second debate in New York on October 16. On Thursday, Vice President Joe Biden and Romney's running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, will hold their only debate of the campaign. Zelizer: VP debates can kill political careers .

"(CNN) -- So a bunch of guys away from home, who should know better, take off their wedding rings, mix testosterone with alcohol and hookers --- an appalling combination --- argue over the price of a lady's company and, all of a sudden, the entire culture of the U.S. Secret Service is thrown into question. All of a sudden, this is the worst disaster for the Secret Service, ever. All of a sudden, the Secret Service is out of control. All of a sudden, anything might have happened, like one of the 11 agents could have been blackmailed to open a door for a sniper or to look the other way as a bomb-carrying terrorist walks up to the president. All of a sudden, the men and women of the Secret Service are no longer the best and the brightest. Especially the men. All of a sudden... Stop! It's time for a reality check. The 11 agents who were sent home from Colombia in disgrace before the president even left Washington were there in a support role. Whether they were manning metal detectors or handling dogs that sweep rooms, whether they were part of a sniper team or standing post at 3 a.m. along a barricaded street, they were not members of the Presidential Protective Division (PPD). They were not on the president's shoulder. At no time was the president's security in danger. What damage did their stupidity do? Obviously, a lot to their personal lives, their marriages and their careers. Obviously, also, a lot to the image and reputation of the Secret Service. The legislation creating the Secret Service was sitting on Abraham Lincoln's desk, waiting to be signed, on April 15, 1865, the night he was assassinated. In those days, the Secret Service was housed inside the Treasury Department, and its job was to protect and defend the currency and monetary instruments of the United States. It didn't get the supplementary duty of protecting the president and vice president until after William McKinley was assassinated in 1901. No agent I have ever met was hired for his sense of humor. These are very serious men and women who do their jobs very seriously. They have always been the best and the brightest. And they still are. You can see it in the way they stand a little taller and walk with a different gait than others in law enforcement. You can see it in their pride. Frankly, I can't think of any other law enforcement agency where pride counts as much as it does with the Secret Service. It's the same pride that is always so visible with the U.S. Marines. That's the reason why this scandal matters. Not because someone thinks the agency is out of control. It's not. Not because of wildly exaggerated threats of blackmail. No, Chicken Little, the sky is not falling. It matters because the idiotic actions of 11 agents who forgot who they are and what their badge stands for deeply affects every active duty agent and tens of thousands of retired agents. Pride has been dented. And agents are, rightly, furious. These are men and women who have made -- and continue to make -- huge personal sacrifices for their share in that pride. The divorce rate among agents is high. That's not because they party with hookers, but because for the privilege of wearing that special five starred badge, they abandon any thoughts of their time being their own. They miss birthdays and Christmas, Little League games, graduations, school plays, first teeth, first steps, first words. When the president travels, especially overseas, it's a flying circus with 800-1,000 people, limousines, helicopters, communications equipment, big guns, small guns, sometimes food, and often 20-30 planes. As an integral part of this, Secret Service agents have two main concerns: To create and to maintain a tightly controlled environment in which the president can do his job safely and to bring everyone home at night. Anything short of that is, the way the Secret Service defines the word, failure. Just as those two things are true, so are these: What happened with those 11 agents is defined as stupidity. They will be dealt with quickly by the Secret Service. The president's opponents will pretend that there are political ramifications and invent whatever capital out of this that they can to embarrass the president. It will take a long time before pride is fully restored, and, if this ever happens again, it will definitely not be soon. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Robinson.","Jeffrey Robinson: Bad behavior of 11 Secret Service agents has caused uproar over whole force .
Time for a reality check, he says; president was not in danger .
He says most agents proud, serious, willing to make big sacrifices for job .

"(CNN) -- Police in Australia have arrested a man accused of breaking into an adult shop and having sex with blow-up dolls, it was reported Wednesday. The 23-year-old allegedly broke into the Laneway Adult Shop in the northen Australian city of Cairns on several occasions, having sex with a doll named ""Jungle Jane,"" the Cairns Post reported. It earlier quoted the store's owner saying the burglar always cleaned up after himself, but the dolls were dumped unceremoniously in an alleyway behind the store. ""He has been taking the dolls out the back and blowing them up and using the dolls and leaving them in the alley,"" he said. ""It is totally bizarre."" Police have charged the unidentified man, believed to be from the city's Manunda suburb, with four counts of breaking and entering. They told the paper that DNA samples had been recovered from one of the dolls.

"(CNN) -- The Los Angeles Lakers' 0-8 preseason and 1-4 start to the regular season was too much for the front office to take. The NBA team on Friday fired second-year head coach Mike Brown, whose efforts to implement a new offense and mesh free-agent signings with stars who won a title two years ago didn't turn into wins. ""Really, it came down to ownership and management looking at the record, looking at the improvement level, and wondering a month or two or three down the road, will we be in the same spot,"" General Manager Mitch Kupchak told reporters. Assistant coach Bernie Bickerstaff will be interim head coach for Friday night's game against the Golden State Warriors, the Lakers said. The Lakers, just two years removed from an NBA championship, are loaded with high-profile talent with the likes of all-stars Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol, and they added former league MVP Steve Nash and former Orlando Magic star Dwight Howard in the off-season. But Nash has missed most of the season's early games with an injury, and the Lakers struggled with a complex new offense Brown was implementing. ""I never thought we got to the point where the offense was flowing,"" Kupchak said. ""You could see flashes of it, but we never got to a point (where it was consistent through a game)."" A reporter asked Kupchak whether a desire to make Howard's first year a smooth one was a factor in the decision. The star center would be a free agent at season's end if he doesn't sign an extension. ""Obviously, we know he is a free agent this summer, and you want to make the experience for him as good as possible, but we have a lot of other people we need to (please) as well,"" Kupchak said. Kupchak said the team's management decided Thursday night to make the move, a day after the Lakers lost a 95-86 game at Utah. Brown released a statement saying he had great respect for the family of Lakers owner Jerry Buss ""and the Lakers' storied tradition, and I thank them for the opportunity they afforded me."" ""I have a deep appreciation for the coaches and players that I worked with this past year and I wish the organization nothing but success as they move forward,"" Brown said. Before taking the Lakers job in May 2011, Brown, 42, compiled a 272-138 regular-season record in five seasons as head coach with the Cleveland Cavaliers. CNN's Joseph S. Miller contributed to this report.","Lakers coach Mike Brown sacked after team's poor start to the new NBA season .

"(CNN) -- From the men on ""Guys with Kids"" to ""The New Normal's"" dads-to-be, prime time is full of fathers. And it's not just NBC. ABC's ""Last Man Standing,"" which stars veteran TV dad Tim Allen, will premiere its second season in November, while ABC Family's ""Baby Daddy"" will be back with season 2 in 2013. Yep. It's a good time to be a TV dad. Just ask Scott Baio. The former ""Happy Days"" and ""Charles in Charge"" stars' ""See Dad Run"" is making its time slot debut on Nick at Nite Sunday. Baio plays David Hobbs on the network's first scripted series. Hobbs is an actor, famous for playing ""America's favorite dad"" on TV, who decides to stay at home with his three kids after his sitcom comes to an end and his wife (Alanna Ubach) goes back to work as an actress. The show-within-a-show premise prompts most of the laughs. Like when Hobbs recycles lines from his sitcom to try and communicate with his lovelorn teenage daughter (Ryan Newman). ""I promise you,"" he recites, ""there's one guy that will always be there for you no matter what."" It's been awhile since Baio's fans have seen him in this capacity. After an arc on the third season of ""Arrested Development"" and two VH1 reality shows, the actor said he wanted to focus on his family and the Bailey Baio Angel Foundation, named after his daughter, which supports families affected by metabolic disorders. As a dad, Baio told CNN it was the premise of ""See Dad Run"" that lured him back to the soundstage, the same one ""Happy Days"" was filmed on, no less. ""I related to it easily and that was it,"" he said. Of course, this isn't the first time Baio has cared for kids on TV. On the CBS sitcom ""Charles in Charge,"" which ran from 1984 to 1990, Baio played a 19-year-old student who babysat three children in exchange for room and board. ""There's nothing new under the sun. No new ideas,"" Baio said. ""This is an idea that's not particularly original, but it's fun and it's funny."" What makes ""See Dad Run"" different, Baio said, is the fact that ""it's a story about a guy who is not an idiot like a lot of TV dads are. He's just ... playing catch up (after playing a dad on TV for 10 years), and he'll never really get there because nobody every really gets there."" Being a dad in real life is ""helpful"" when it comes to playing a dad on ""See Dad Run,"" Baio said, adding, it has shaped the way he approaches his character. ""You don't really know what the hell you're doing most of the time anyway,"" Baio said. ""I just sort of get through the day hoping I didn't screw it up totally. So that's what I try to do on the show, not screw up my kids emotionally.""","Scott Baio's ""See Dad Run"" makes its time slot debut Sunday on Nick at Nite .

"(CNN) -- An elderly woman who was known as Colombia's ""Queen of Cocaine"" was gunned down in the northwestern city of Medellin, police said Tuesday. Griselda Blanco, 69, was killed by two bullets at close range -- a violent end not unlike the ones that authorities say she ordered during her prime in the 1970s and 1980s. Witnesses heard the roar of a motorcycle and two gunshots Monday afternoon, Medellin police spokesman Diego Chavarria said. By the time authorities arrived at the scene in Belen, a residential neighborhood in Medellin, they found Blanco lying on the ground in a pool of blood. Blanco, also known as ""the godmother"" and ""mafia's mother,"" gained notoriety in the 1970s and '80s when, authorities say, she was responsible for shipping multi-ton shipments of cocaine from Colombia to Miami. She was also the mastermind, investigators say, of countless murders. She was also linked to drug lord Pablo Escobar. Previously on CNN.com: Alleged leader of Colombia's Rastrojos drug gang arrested . In 1975, Blanco was charged in Miami with conspiring to manufacture, smuggle and distribute cocaine in the United States. For the next decade, she lived in Colombia, using false names and documents to hide from authorities. The Drug Enforcement Administration arrested Blanco in Irvine, California, in 1985. She was convicted and sentenced to six years in prison. But prosecutors were not done with her. Blanco was charged in 1994 with ordering three murders in the Miami area. The killings -- including that of 3-year-old Johnny Castro, who was shot while riding in a car with his targeted father -- happened in 1982. Talking about her case at the time she was charged, Al Singleton, a sergeant with the Metro Dade Police Department, said police believed Blanco was responsible for dozens of murders in the Miami area. ""If she was not one of the most prolific traffickers in the Miami area, she clearly was one of the most violent. We've got her, conservatively, estimating her to be involved in at least 40 homicides between Miami, Queens and Broward County,"" he said at the time. After serving her sentence, Blanco was deported to her native Colombia in 2004, where she apparently lived a quiet life. Local media reported that she was gunned down as she was leaving a butcher shop with a pregnant daughter-in-law, who was not injured. According to a report by CNN affiliate Caracol TV, Blanco was the mother of four children. One of them is still serving a sentence for drug trafficking in the United States, and two were murdered.

"(CNN) -- The opening ceremony of the 1998 Africa Cup of Nations was unforgettable -- not so much for the color and performers that enlivened Burkina Faso's national stadium, more for the unexpected events that unfolded in front of the watching FIFA president. With Burkina Faso's team side nicknamed the Stallions, Sepp Blatter watched a rag of horses dance across a naked pitch as an unfortunate local traipsed behind them, using his hands and a cardboard box to clear the dung falling on a surface that would be staging an international match just moments later. The scenario was one that could have endangered any player's well-being but very little was made of it -- for this was a tournament where things have been, and always will be, a little different. In years gone by, a variety of bizarre incidents have often fed the western media's desire to pour scorn on an ever improving tournament -- as accusations of witchcraft have overshadowed matches (see Nigeria vs. Senegal in 2000), players have been sent off for assaulting medical staff and organizers have taken to painting bald turf green to make pitches look better on television. That is not to mention the wild defending, tackling and haircuts that have long decorated Africa's biggest sporting event in years gone by nor, more seriously, the terrible gun attack on the Togo team bus that killed two delegation members in Angola two years ago. Somewhat unusually though, the 2012 finals will be remembered for all the right reasons -- namely, the fairytale triumph of unfancied Zambia in Gabon, a land where 18 members of the national team had died in a 1993 plane crash. World Cup motivation . On Sunday, the line up for the next tournament will be complete once 15 teams successfully negotiate a variety of tense playoffs and join hosts South Africa in the finals. Premier League managers will again warm their larynges prior to their habitual howl about the event taking place in the middle of the European season -- but for once, the timing of the next tournament really is key. For the decision by the Confederation of African Football to move the Nations Cup to an odd-ending year means it will end its reign as the only continental championship to stage its final just four months before the World Cup. Given that the last Nations Cup to take place in an odd year pre-dated the 1966 World Cup, which Africa boycotted in protest at its meagre allocation of half a qualifying berth given they were required to face an Asian country in a playoff, the decision to move the biennial tournament is long overdue. The primary reason was of course to assist Africa's teams at the World Cup, with a variety of players, coaches and conditioning experts having long opined that it is near impossible for international footballers to peak -- both physically and performance wise -- at two major tournaments so close together. Then there was the issue of how poor Nations Cup displays by World Cup bound sides could lead to the firing of coaches with just weeks to go before football's greatest showpiece got underway, as has happened repeatedly down the years. However, Africa's continuing failure to triumph at a World Cup lay at the heart of the decision, with the continent having never reached the semifinals -- gallingly failing to emulate Asia's breakthrough when hosting in 2002 despite the last finals taking place on African soil. Yes, Cameroon, Senegal and Ghana may have all reached the last eight (in 1990, 2002 and 2010 respectively) but a more revealing statistic is that no World Cup has ever found more than one African side in the knock-out stages. This is despite the African tally having gone up to two in 1982, increased to three in 1994 before reaching today's tally of five in 1998 -- while South Africa's World Cup staging allowed for a record six African teams in 2010. The South Africans will once again host in January, when the 29th Nations Cup will kick off just 11 months after the 28th. The restricted time limit - in a year when Africa's road to the 2014 World Cup also began - has led to a heavily condensed qualifying campaign, with the usual league format replaced by two rounds of knock out playoffs. Full stadiums . The draw has meant that one of two big West African sides will not qualify since Didier Drogba's Ivory Coast, beaten finalists in February, are taking on the Senegal of Papiss Demba Cisse and Demba Ba, with the visitors taking a 4-2 lead to Dakar this weekend. Other absorbing ties include Cameroon's home clash with Cape Verde, with the four time champions currently trailing the islanders 2-0 and celebrated striker Samuel Eto'o an injury doubt, while Zambia are by no means guaranteed to defend their title at the championship since they take a narrow 1-0 first leg lead to Uganda. After South Africa took over the 2013 finals from war ravaged Libya, the country's chief Nations Cup organizer declared ""priority number one is full stadiums, full stadiums, full stadiums"", with low attendances having often blighted previous tournaments. Now Cape Town may be awash with international tourists in January, a month when the sun is at its height, and boast a stadium that hosted a World Cup semifinal but the city will have no Nations Cup role to play -- with matches taking place in Durban, Johannesburg, Nelspruit, Port Elizabeth and Rustenburg instead. When the latter venue attracted just 7,500 fans for a South African World Cup qualifier earlier this year, extra ammunition was given to those who argue that the ruling African National Congress government overlooked Cape Town simply because it is run by their bitter political rivals -- the Democratic Alliance. It is not the only area where South Africa falls down, for the country's captain, Steven Pienaar, quit international football this month to concentrate on his club career with Everton -- a real kick in the teeth for both the tournament and South African fans whose struggling team have failed to qualify for the last two Nations Cups. South Africa won the competition when they last staged it in 1996 but crowds were pitifully low, despite the presence of continental legends like Liberia's George Weah -- the only African to have ever been crowned World Footballer of the Year -- and Ghanaian greats Abedi Pele and Tony Yeboah. After hosting the World Cup, South African organizers frequently claimed that their football would never be the same again but local fans need to come out in force in three months' time if substance is to be added to comments which should not seem so fanciful. Yet the real impact of the 2013 Nations Cup will take place long after the event -- as African teams walk out at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, with lighter legs and a theory to prove.","Line up for African football's showpiece event, the Cup of Nations, to be determined by Sunday .

Try to escape into a book, and the phone would ring. Toward the end of the campaign, most of us were getting about 10 calls every day. For all of the high-tech Internet ads and targeted robocalls (I had no idea I was on a first-name basis with so many politicians, but the calls often addressed either me or my wife directly), in the end, election day was almost comfortingly old-fashioned. Candidates and their supporters stood outside the polling locations, usually churches or schools, handing out paper flyers hoping to persuade late deciders to support their candidates. Inside the polling stations, dedicated poll workers -- the unsung heroes of American democracy -- tried their best to adapt to complex regulations governing who among their neighbors was and was not qualified to vote. Ironically, given how much money was spent here, for the second presidential race in a row, Ohio did not matter. Barack Obama could have lost Ohio and won the election. Still, Ohio, with its hefty chunk of electoral votes and predilection for voting for the eventual winner, will doubtless remain at the center of future presidential contests. Although Ohio once again voted for the winner (a pattern that now extends to 1964), those expecting a satisfying victory of one party over the other in Ohio were disappointed. In its own gentle way, it was as if the Buckeye State, like most voters across the country on Tuesday night, was admonishing the nation to seek some sort of bipartisan consensus. While agreeing to give Obama a second term, Ohio voters handed the president a much narrower victory than he had enjoyed four years earlier. In fact, if Mitt Romney had just done a bit better than John McCain had in Ohio, he would have won the state. And Ohio voters showed their ambivalence by deciding to keep the state legislature solidly in Republican hands and to send Republicans to Congress in 12 of Ohio's 16 congressional districts. While Democrats will argue that these Republican victories are more the result of political gerrymandering than clear voter intent, Ohioans also soundly rejected a ballot measure on Tuesday that would have redistricting out of the hands of the legislature. While pundits have emphasized the importance of the auto bailout as essentially buying the votes of Ohio auto workers and their families, the harsh headline of the Mitt Romney opinion piece that had been published in the New York Times -- ""Let Detroit go Bankrupt"" -- might have offended voters more than the president's actions had earned their gratitude. Over the past few years, Republicans in Ohio have shown themselves to be quite adept at offending voters. They did very well in the state's midterm elections two years ago. After regaining total control of the Ohio government, they passed a bill restricting the collective bargaining rights of nearly all public employees -- not only teachers and other government workers, as had been the case in Wisconsin, but also police and firefighters. The bill was overwhelmingly defeated when placed on the ballot in November 2011, and the anti-Republican momentum generated by the legislation rolled into this year's presidential contest. Somewhat surprisingly, Republicans spent almost no time in Ohio rebuilding their support. Although there was a massive GOP get-out-the-vote effort, little was done to repair the party's brand name. One of the most obvious moves that Republicans might have made would be to place moderate and widely popular Ohio Sen. Rob Portman on the ticket in 2012, instead of the more divisive Paul Ryan. Sixty-eight years ago, in the summer of 1944, the Republican Party nominated Ohio Gov. John Bricker to be the vice-presidential candidate alongside presidential nominee Thomas Dewey. Although the GOP ticket was crushed by FDR, it is interesting to note that Ohio was one of only 12 states carried by the Republicans. It is hard not to credit Bricker with delivering his home state. After all, Roosevelt had never before lost Ohio. Four years later, Dewey, with his new running mate, California Gov. Earl Warren, would lose the Buckeye State in an election that everyone expected him to win. If there was one Republican winner in Ohio, it was probably Portman. As Romney's practice partner for his debate preparations, Portman played a crucial role in Romney's success during the first presidential debate, the only event over the past few months that seemed to move the polls in Romney's direction. This was actually the fourth campaign in which Portman has played this role, and some GOP insiders are probably contemplating that perhaps it is time for Portman to be a presidential candidate rather than just playing one during debate practice. It does make some sense to have an Ohioan at the top of the ticket. After all, the one thing we can be sure of in 2016 is that, once again, all eyes will be on Ohio. But for those of us who make our home in the Buckeye State, this is something that we would rather not think about right now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Sracic.","Paul Sracic: Ohioans were bombarded with campaign ads and calls .

"(CNN) -- The wife of fugitive Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, three of his children and some of his grandchildren arrived in Algeria on Monday morning, Algerian diplomats said. Mourad Benmehidi, the Algerian ambassador to the United Nations, said he relayed the news to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon earlier Monday. Benmehidi said his country granted entrance to Gadhafi's wife, Safia, his daughter, Aisha, sons Hannibal and Mohamed and their children on ""humanitarian grounds."" ""We made sure the international community has been informed,"" said Benmehidi. The ambassador said he did not know whether Moammar Gadhafi was expected to seek entry into Algeria and claimed none of the Gadhafis were subject to U.N. Security Council sanctions. In fact, U.N. Security Council Resolution 1970, passed on February 26, includes the names of all three Gadhafi children who are now in Algeria as being subject to a ""travel ban"" because of their ""closeness of association with (the) regime."" The U.N. ban requires ""all member states"" to prevent them and others listed from entering their territories, unless there is some special circumstance that the council agrees warrants an exception. The resolution also allows the nation -- in this case, Algeria -- to determine ""on a case-by-case basis that such entry or transit is required to advance peace and stability (and) notifies the committee within 48 hours after making such a determination."" News on Monday of the Gadhafi relatives' departure from Libya came the same day that a senior rebel commander reported that Khamis Gadhafi, a son of the Libyan leader and military commander in his regime, had been killed Sunday night. Mahdi al-Harati, the vice chairman of the rebels' Military Council, the military wing of the National Transitional Council, said Khamis Gadhafi died in a battle with rebel forces between the villages of Tarunah and Bani Walid in northwest Libya. Khamis Gadhafi, who was a senior military commander under his father, was taken to a hospital where he died from his injuries, said al-Harati. He was then buried in the area by rebel forces, al-Harati said. His father, Moammar Gadhafi, meanwhile, is still wanted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague on charges of war crimes. So, too, is Moammar's son Saif al-Islam Gadhafi and his brother-in-law and intelligence chief, Abdullah al-Sanussi. But should any of those three get to Algeria, there is no guarantee they would face trial. Algeria is not a signatory of the Rome Treaty that established the International Criminal Court. The longtime ruler's whereabouts have been a mystery since the rebels overran Tripoli last week. Rebel commanders said Gadhafi was not found in the network of tunnels beneath his Bab al-Aziziya compound, and reports that he had been holed up in an apartment block nearby or at a farm near Tripoli's airport didn't pan out. The National Transitional Council, which is forming a provisional government in Tripoli since overrunning the city last week, has not yet confirmed the news about Gadhafi's family members, spokesman Mahmoud al-Shammam told CNN. But he said that if true, the NTC would demand the return of the family members. He promised they would receive a fair trial. The rebels had previously speculated that Gadhafi could be trying to reach Algeria or Libya's southern neighbor Chad, both countries with which his government had close ties. ""Those are the only two neighboring countries that have been showing support for him,"" Guma El-Gamaty, an NTC official based in Britain, said last week. In London, Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office said the fate of Gadhafi's relatives ""is a matter for the NTC."" In Washington, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters the United States has no indication Gadhafi has left Libya. On Monday night, a senior official in President Barack Obama's administration -- speaking on condition of anonymity, given the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue -- said the Libyan leader's wife and three children are believed to be in the Algerian government's custody. The official echoed earlier comments from U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland that what's important is that Gadhafi and his relatives, wherever they are, are held accountable. ""We want to see justice and accountability for Gadhafi and those members of his family with blood on their hands and those members of his regime with blood on their hands,"" Nuland said. ""But it'll be a decision of the Libyan people, (as to) how that goes forward."" Algeria, which the CIA World Factbook says has a population of 35 million, repeatedly has been mentioned as a possible destination for Gadhafi and his family. Guma El-Gamaty, the Britain-based coordinator for Libya's National Transitional Council, said earlier this month that Algeria and Chad ""are the only two neighboring countries that have been showing support for him."" Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted similarities between Libya under Gadhafi and Algeria, with a largely oil-driven economy and strong central government under President Abdelaziz Bouteflika ""that is concerned with popular uprisings."" ""My sense is that Algeria was supportive, in part, because they had worked out a modus vivendi (or, practical compromise) with Gadhafi and they feared the contagion of mass popular unrest in the region,"" Alterman said. Yet while many nations in Africa had determined ""it was easier to manage (Gadhafi) than to defeat him,"" especially when he shared some oil-derived wealth around the continent, Alterman said he finds it unlikely any nation will now risk international scorn by taking in the embattled leader himself -- or that Gadhafi would ever leave Libya. Of Gadhafi's family members now in Algeria, Aisha Gadhafi was a good will ambassador for the U.N. Development Program and has kept a low profile during the six-month revolt against her father. She had been named to the position in 2009 to address HIV/AIDS and violence against women in Libya, but U.N. officials terminated her position as Gadhafi unleashed his military on anti-government protesters early in the conflict. She is due to give birth in early September, sources close to her family told CNN. Hannibal Gadhafi is a headline maker. He has reportedly paid millions of dollars for private parties featuring big-name entertainers including Beyonce, Mariah Carey and Usher. Several of the artists now say they have given the money back. Rebels who picked through his seaside villa on Sunday also introduced CNN's Dan Rivers to his family's badly burned former nanny, who said she had been doused with boiling water by his wife, model Aline Skaf, when she refused to beat one of their crying toddlers. The nanny, Shweyga Mullah, is covered with scars from the abuse, which was corroborated by another member of the household staff. Hannibal was also accused of a string of violent incidents in Europe, including beating his staff and his wife. Charges were dropped in the case of his staff, and Skaf later said her broken nose was the result of an accident. In another high-profile episode, Hannibal was stopped after driving his Ferrari 90 mph the wrong way on the Champs-Elysees in Paris. He invoked diplomatic immunity. Mohamed Gadhafi, meanwhile, was one of three Gadhafi sons who had been reported captured as the rebels overran Tripoli last week. But the rebels said he had escaped the next day. CNN's Jill Dougherty, Greg Botelho, Richard Roth and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","NEW: A U.S. official says the Gadhafi kin are believed to be in Algerian custody .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal officials said Thursday more needs to be done to warn rescuers of special dangers at the scene of small plane crashes. Although firefighters are well versed about the dangers of burning fuel and sharp debris, they may not be aware that some aviation systems -- systems considered safety devices aloft -- become especially hazardous on the ground. Among the hazards: ejection seat rockets, airbag components, and explosive charges that deploy parachutes that can lower the entire aircraft to the ground. ""These explosive components, if they remain charged and are unknown to first responders and investigators, pose a high level of risk to those working in and around the aircraft wreckage,"" the National Transportation Safety Board said. The safety board cited five incidents since 2001 in which first responders and accident investigators who responded to plane wrecks were evidently unaware of the hazard of explosive components. ""In some cases, they began performing rescue, fire suppression and accident investigation activities that might have inadvertently activated the explosive component, posing a great risk of injury,"" the safety board said. None resulted in fatalities or injuries to the responders. In one incident -- the January 2012 fatal crash of an experimental jet near Rainbow City, Alabama -- a police officer became aware of the hidden dangers only after an NTSB investigator told him by phone not to allow the recovery of the pilot's remains until the pilot's ejection seat could be deactivated. In another incident, firefighters attempting to put out a blaze at a Cirrus SR22 crash took additional safety precautions after being told the plane had a BRS -- a solid-fuel rocket used to deploy the plane's parachute. The NTSB is recommending that the Federal Aviation Administration take additional steps to address the safety issue. The FAA should require aircraft owners to disclose the presence of explosive safety devices when they register their aircraft every three years. The online registry is easily available to first responders, the NTSB said. The FAA also should issue a safety bulletin to first responders, the board recommended. The FAA said it will review the recommendations. ""We have collaborated with ballistic device manufacturers, airplane manufacturers, firefighting organizations and other first responder groups to develop training about the potential hazards at an accident scene and to ensure that warning markings meet the necessary guidelines,"" the FAA said in a statement.","NTSB warns of hazards about small aircraft fires .

"New York (CNN) -- The man who confessed to the 1979 murder of 6-year-old Etan Patz was indicted Wednesday by a Manhattan grand jury, authorities said. His attorney, Harvey Fishbein, said Pedro Hernandez -- who was arrested on second degree murder and kidnapping charges -- is scheduled to appear in court Thursday. ""Nothing that occurs in the course of this trial will answer what actually happened to Etan Patz,"" said Fishbein, who said his client has been ""repeatedly diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia."" ""Partly as a result of that disorder, my client has an IQ in the borderline-to-mild mental retardation range,"" he said. Fishbein had previously told a judge that Hernandez has a history of mental disorders, suffers from hallucinations and is bipolar. Case 'awakened' America . But district attorney spokeswoman Erin Duggan said Wednesday's indictment was ""the outcome of a lengthy and deliberative process, involving months of factual investigation and legal analysis."" ""We believe the evidence that Mr. Hernandez killed Etan Patz to be credible and persuasive, and that his statements are not the product of any mental illness,"" she said.

Hernandez allegedly told authorities that he threw away the boy's body in a garbage bag. The remains have not been found. Investigation a 33-year long roller coaster ride . After attending high school in the Camden, New Jersey, area, Hernandez moved to Manhattan at the age of 18, sharing an apartment in the city's SoHo neighborhood with his older sister. He then took a job as a stock clerk at a corner convenience store in Lower Manhattan for about a month before returning to his mother's south Jersey home in the summer of 1979, according to family members and police. Etan disappeared roughly a month earlier, on May 25. Describing Hernandez as having been a quiet young man, relatives say his demeanor changed upon his return to New Jersey. He grew further withdrawn while also frequently becoming ill, they said. Though his whereabouts after 1979 remain murky, family members say he at one point returned to New York.

"Haryana, India (CNN) -- She's just 16 years old and one month ago was about to sit her final-year exams when she says she was shoved into a car and gang-raped by eight men in a small village in the Indian state of Haryana. ""I remember being driven by the canal, all the guys were standing there then four more boys came on a motorbike,"" said the teenager, who had been hoping to be the first female high school graduate in her family. ""There were approximately 12 men. Eight men raped me, they then fed me a pill, they filmed the whole thing and left."" The teenager kept her ordeal secret for 10 days before her mother noticed something was wrong. ""She would just lie in bed all day, she wouldn't talk, she wouldn't eat, I thought she was ill. Those rapists had threatened to kill our family and show the video to the entire village if she opened her mouth,"" she said. The 16-year-old's mother also remained silent. ""People told me to forget about what had happened. They said this is a matter of your daughter's reputation. Who will marry her if people find out she was raped? Let it be, don't make a big deal,"" she said. Bollywood star: The Truth Alone Prevails . When her father heard about the rape video, he couldn't live with the thought of his daughter's pain and how she would be judged by society, her mother said. He committed suicide by swallowing pesticides. Devastated by his death, the teenager vowed to seek justice, not only for herself but other rape victims in Haryana, many of whom are too scared to report the crime. ""It happens a lot with dalit [lower caste] girls but they keep quiet because they fear for their reputation. I probably would not have spoken up either but I didn't want my father's sacrifice to go to waste,"" she said. Police say all eight of the accused rapists have been arrested and are awaiting trial. In the past month, at least 17 other young women have reported rapes in Haryana, a relatively sparsely-populated state in the country's northwest. In 2011, 733 rapes were reported throughout the state, a fraction of the 24,206 cases alleged throughout the country over the full year. While more than 24,000 rapes were reported, convictions were only recorded for just over one quarter of cases, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). Local police say the incidence of rape has fallen in Haryana over recent months, and that recent cases have attracted ""hype."" ""The nature of the crime created hype in the number of rape cases registered in Haryana,"" said Satish Balan, Police Superintendent of the Hisar district. ""In two cases there were suicides which led to media coverage of rapes in Haryana otherwise the number of rapes registered has come down by 15%. This is the truth."" Some local politicians blame progress and the proliferation of modern technology like mobile phones, internet, television and films for encouraging sex attacks. However, women's rights groups say the increasing gap between the number of men and women in Haryana is one of the main contributors. The 2011 National census revealed there were 877 females for every 1,000 males in the state, compared with the national ratio of 940 females to 1,000 males. High incidences of female feticide in Haryana are largely to blame for the imbalance, say rights groups, who say families traditionally value boys over girls. Government of India census results . Provisional population results . The khap panchayats, or the self-appointed village caste councils, which have no legal authority, have suggested that lowering the legal age for marriage could cut the incidences of rape. ""The marriageable age for girls, which is 18 right now should be changed to 16 or 15 so then these cases will decrease, these will be stopped,"" council member Jitendra Chhattar told CNN. The United Nations says lowering the marriageable age is not a solution. In an open letter to the country's minister for Women and Child Development, Krishna Tirath, four U.N. agencies urged the Indian government to give the issue urgent attention. ""Child marriage is not a solution to protecting girls from sexual crimes including rape. In fact, child marriage denies a girl of her childhood, disrupts her education, limits her opportunities, increases her risk to be a victim of violence, jeopardizes her health and therefore constitutes an obstacle to the achievement of nearly every Millennium Development Goal and the development of healthy communities,"" the letter said. Tirath told CNN in an interview Thursday that she strongly condemned the cases of rape being reported in Haryana. ""I will be taking the issue up with the Chief Minister of Haryana to take strict and stringent action to ensure that safety and security of women is not compromised in anyway. We are already working on the issues on the child-sex ratio and giving it the highest priority,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Chelsea captain John Terry is set to return to action quicker than originally suspected after a scan on his injured knee revealed ""no significant damaage,"" the English Premier League giants said Monday. Terry was stretchered off in agony in his side's 1-1 home draw with Liverpool after a collision with Uruguay star Luis Suarez. A lengthy spell on the sidelines looked inevitable but after a scan Chelsea said his right knee injury would heal in a matter of weeks rather than months. The former England international had returned from a four-game domestic ban for racially abusing an opponent, and made an immediate impact as he put the London club in front in the first half at Stamford Bridge Sunday. But then came his accidental collision with Suarez, who later scored the equalizer for the visitors to put a dampener on Chelsea's title challenge. He took to Twitter after the game to send Terry his best wishes. ""Hugs to Terry, I hope it's nothing serious,"" he wrote. Chelsea's first profit of Abramovich era . European champion Chelsea had set the early-season pace, but now trail leaders Manchester United by three points after dropping into third place. EPL titleholders Manchester City claimed second on Sunday with a 2-1 win at home to Tottenham, coming from behind before substitute Edin Dzeko snatched a late winner. Chelsea's momentum was derailed following claims of racism laid against referee Mark Clattenburg after the controversial home defeat by United on October 28, which was followed by the arrest of a Chelsea fan who made an alleged monkey gesture at a United player in a cup game just days later. Terry wasn't selected for Wednesday's Champions League win over Shakhtar Donetsk, where David Luiz and Gary Cahill looked shaky in defense, but the former England skipper made his mark at Stamford Bridge. The 31-year-old scored his 50th career goal for Chelsea in the 20th minute as he lost his marker Daniel Agger at a corner and powerfully headed home at the near post from Juan Mata's delivery. But he had to be replaced by Cahill after Suarez fell on his knee during a tackle, following a mistake by Terry that gave the ball to Steven Gerrard. Suarez, a hate figure with opposing fans after last season's Patrice Evra racism controversy, matched Robin van Persie's EPL-leading eight goals this season when he headed home from Jamie Carragher's flick-on in the 73rd minute. The Uruguay striker could have later ended Liverpool's run of five games without a win but was denied by keeper Petr Cech. The draw, Liverpool's sixth in 11 league matches, left Brendan Rogers' team in 13th place -- 15 points behind bitter rivals United. Manchester City moved to within two points of Alex Ferguson's United team, who came from two goals down to beat Aston Villa 3-2 on Saturday. The pressure on manager Roberto Mancini appeared to be increasing when England goalkeeper Joe Hart failed to keep out a header from Tottenham defender Steven Caulker in the 21st minute. But last season's top scorer Sergio Aguero capitalized on poor defending to level in the 66th minute and Dzeko once again proved his worth off the bench with an 88th-minute winner. It was the Bosnia striker's sixth league goal this season, and five have come as a sub. ""The goals are my message. That's the only thing,"" Dzeko said after the match. ""Again from a free-kick we conceded a goal as stupid as against Arsenal. We have to improve there. But after goal we were the better team for the 90 minutes and in the end we deserved it. Even when we are losing we come back."" City also came from behind in midweek to draw 2-2 with Ajax in a result that all but ended hopes of qualifying for the last 16 of the Champions League. Newcastle salvaged a 2-2 draw against Bruges in the second-tier Europa League on Thursday, but could not repeat the trick against West Ham. Kevin Nolan scored the only goal against his former team, giving visiting manager Sam Allardyce victory against the club that sacked him in 2008.

"(CNN) -- For months, Republicans derisively doubted if U.S. President Barack Obama was a true friend of Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, questioning if Americans should re-elect someone who might not be on the same page with the long-time U.S. ally. Now, it's Netanyahu facing political heat in his own country -- for his relationship with Obama. Despite sometimes blistering attacks over where his administration stands on Israel and against Iran's nuclear program, Obama this week emerged victorious in the U.S. presidential election. But Netanyahu has months to go in his own campaign, including time to answer questions about his relationship with the American leader. Leading the charge against the prime minister is the Kadima party, which holds more seats at 28 than any other in Israel's Knesset and which quit Netanyahu's coalition government in July. The centrist party is among those aiming to gain more power and unseat Netanyahu when Israelis go to the polls on January 22, 2013. Kadima wasted little time after Obama's election win in going after Netanyahu. In a post Wednesday on its Facebook page, the party claimed the prime minister had sided with U.S. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and could not be trusted -- by Obama and, moreover, by Israelis -- to be a robust, effective partner with Washington. In that post and in an open letter on its website, Kadima highlighted the importance of U.S.-Israeli relations. Jewish media is abuzz, too, about a Wednesday speech by former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in which he claimed that Netanyahu had interjected himself into the U.S. election by trying to undermine the incumbent president. Multiple Jewish media outlets reported Olmert said Netanyahu got involved in part to satisfy Sheldon Adelson, who donated close to $100 million this year toward defeating Obama and electing Republicans to Congress, according to insiders involved in the process. The Jerusalem Post reported Olmert said that ""Netanyahu's behavior in recent months brings up the question if Netanyahu has a friend in the White House, and I'm not sure."" ""This represents a significant breach of the basic rules governing ties between nations, made worse by the fact that these are allies like Israel and the United States,"" Olmert said in the same speech to Jewish leaders in New York, according to another leading Jewish newspaper, Haaretz. Netanyahu and officials in his government have beaten down such accusations of meddling, while playing up what they describe as strong ties between Israel and the United States. In a statement congratulating Obama, Netanyahu said, ""The security relationship between the United States and Israel is rock solid, and I look forward to working with President Obama to further strengthen this relationship."" In an interview Thursday with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon acknowledged that Romney and Netanyahu have a special connection from having once worked together at the same U.S.-based consulting firm, but ""to say there was a preference, it's a little bit of a stretch."" ""We have no better friend than President Obama,"" Ayalon said, repeating an assertion he'd made previously. The deputy foreign minister credited Obama with spearheading international sanctions and other punitive measures that he said has made Iran ""very vulnerable ... socially, politically, economically."" Whatever past differences there might have been about timelines and goals, Ayalon said Israel will follow the U.S. president's cue when it comes to Iran. ""I think today we can safely say that we are very much of the same page, and we'll continue to follow the lead of the United States,"" he said. Such a line of questioning, and political attacks, about U.S.-Israeli relations is nothing new -- as evidenced in the recent U.S. election. For months, Republicans hammered Obama, claiming he hadn't been a loyal enough friend to Netanyahu or tough enough on Iran. One public dust-up came earlier this fall, when Israeli sources told CNN the White House had turned down a request for a meeting between Netanyahu and Obama while both were in New York for a U.N. meeting, prompting Romney to say he ""can't imagine ever saying no"" to a meeting request from Netanyahu. The White House later said no request had been made, and within hours of the story breaking, Obama called the prime minister and said the two countries maintain ""close cooperation on Iran and other security issues."" The Obama administration has stressed repeatedly that it is committed to maintaining a strong relationship with Israel. In May 2011, the president said, ""The bonds between the United States and Israel are unbreakable, and the commitment of the United States to the security of Israel is ironclad."" Now, the same issue -- how well can Netanyahu and Obama work with and trust each other -- is being debated nearly 6,000 miles from Washington in another heated election. This is a testament to the unique, historically tight relations between these two nations, as well as the vibrant brand of democracy that define their political systems. Despite obvious differences, Netanyahu and Kadima leader Shaul Mofaz did unite this week on one matter -- lauding the U.S. political system and expressing their desire for Israel to follow its lead. Mofaz described ""American democracy (as) a beacon for Israel and her people."" Netanyahu, meanwhile, characterized the United States as ""the greatest democracy on Earth.""","Republicans had criticized Obama over whether he was close enough to Israel .
Now Israeli opposition leaders are saying Netanyahu can't be trusted by Obama .

"(CNN) -- A wave of anger over austerity is sweeping across Europe as workers fed up with government spending cuts and tax increases took to the streets in a coordinated day of action Wednesday. Some of the largest and occasionally violent protests took place in Spain, where a general strike is under way. Public transport has been shut down, or disrupted, while many schools, shops, factories and airports are closed. There were also significant walkouts -- and outbreaks of violence -- in Portugal, Greece and Italy. Limited protests are taking place in other countries, including France and Belgium -- and even in Germany where the traditionally strong economy has taken a hit. Transport across the continent is being disrupted by the strikes. Hundreds of flights have been grounded, and there are severe reductions in intercity rail services and local transit systems. Protesters say the cuts will compromise livelihoods and increase unemployment. Clashes are reported to have taken place between police and activists in various cities. The strikes have been called by the European Trade Union Confederation, which represents 85 separate organizations across the continent. ""Austerity is a total dead end, and must be abandoned. Social protection and wages can no longer be sacrificed,"" the confederation said on its website. ""This is a social emergency, and it is time to listen to what the citizens and workers have to say, and to change course."" In Spain, this is the second general strike in a year. The country's two largest unions have plenty to protest about with unemployment standing at more than 25% and cuts from health to education. Protests led to 118 people being arrested and 74 people being injured, including 43 members of security forces, the Interior Ministry said. Nuria Manzano, from the UGT union explained why it was important for workers to support the action. ""The cuts aren't limited to Spain. They are happening in the whole European Union. ""That's why it is important that all Europe protest against these cuts and against this way to do politics."" But despite the recent violent social unrest and the rise of suicides blamed on increasing financial hardship the government is sticking to its fiscal plan. Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy said: ""I said I would lower taxes, but I am raising them, I haven't changed my criteria nor will I decline to put them down when possible, but circumstances have changed and I must adapt to them."" It's a similar picture in neighboring Portugal where protesters are taking part in what they're calling a ""coordinated day of action."" Portugal's main trade unions say the protests are meant to show mass discontent and send European leaders a warning. Months of quiet resignation in the country have turned to anger and discontent. A combination of severe tax increases -- and rising unemployment -- have made social unrest the norm. Unemployed Pedro Barroso explained the reason for the unrest. ""You see people participating in demonstrations more and more. The social awareness is noticeable. This year we had more demonstrations than in the last 20 years!"" On Monday several hundred people took to the streets as German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the Portuguese capital to rally morale. Many held banners saying: ""Merkel, you're not welcome."" In Italy, clashes broke out in Rome, Milan and Turin with several police officers reported injured. The unions say the strike is designed not to damage the economy, but to show the scale of the opposition to austerity cuts. ""This is a government that is destroying all the rights to social services with the excuse of the European Union,"" said one demonstrator, Felice Nardi. ""We believe that the voice of the workers should finally be heard because they are the ones suffering. There have been a series of measures that are really bringing the people to ruin."" On Monday, with youth unemployment approaching 35%, 3,000 students vented their anger. ""We are students and our future is at stake and we need to do something,"" said one student called Chiara. ""If we don't do something, who will?"" CNN's Ben Wedeman said the government must strike a fine balance between sometime violent domestic oppostion and its international debt obligations. ""In elections next year we'll see how successful the government was in achieving this balance."" In Greece, police said 5,000 people took to the streets to protest peacefully over the economic pain they are suffering. In the last two years alone public sector workers have seen their wages shrink by up to 40%. Unemployed civil servant Evangelia Katsaropoulou explained why she planned to join the protests. ""I have two children, they're twins, and the situation is tragic,"" she told CNN. ""What I want to say to everyone is that they have to come onto the streets and shout so that these measures do not take place."" The International Monetary Fund and the European Union are debating whether and when Greece can receive its next bailout payment. Protesters, such as pensioner Thimios Marvitsas, hope to remind them that they are the ones bearing the burden of austerity. ""All these measures they are pushing us back 50, 60 years,"" he said. ""They are cutting our pensions in half, there is a million unemployed, more taxes. In other words our lives are just getting worse and worse."" Even in Germany there were protests, including 200 demonstrators in Berlin. CNN's Fred Pleitgen said that unions organized the protests more out of solidarity than real anger. However he added that the economy was slowing down and the eurozone crisis was taking its toll on the labor market. Unemployment is lower than in other countries but trades unions warn that austerity measures could damage the economy. ""Angela Merkel has become a lightning rod for protesters across Europe due to anger over her insistence that debt-ridden countries adopt austerity,"" he said. ""Now the same is happening in Germany itself."" In Belgium, about 200 people protested, but no violence was reported, police said. CNN's Michael Martinez, Sofia Fernandes and Alla Eshchenko and Claudia Rebaza contributed to this report.","NEW: 74 people, including 43 security forces, injured in Spain; 118 people arrested .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether police can take DNA samples from criminal suspects following their arrest, a case based on Maryland law with potentially national implications for the use of a popular investigative tool. Justices will weigh a challenge to the state's law by Alonzo King, who was convicted of a 2003 rape on Maryland's Eastern Shore with the assistance of genetic material obtained following his arrest three years ago on an unrelated assault charge. King moved to suppress the use of the DNA on Fourth Amendment grounds, but was ultimately convicted of the rape offense. Federal law in 1994 created a national database in which local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies could compare and share information on DNA matches from convicted felons. But courts have been at odds on just when such samples can be collected and the information distributed. A divided Maryland Court of Appeals agreed with King, saying suspects under arrest enjoy a higher level of privacy than a convicted felon. This, the court said, outweighed the state's law enforcement interests. The appeals court also said that obtaining King's DNA immediately after arrest was not necessary in identifying him and that the process was more personally invasive than standard fingerprinting. State officials asked the Supreme Court to intervene, saying the state court ruling ""resulted in the loss of a valuable crime-fighting tool."" They said that from a law enforcement and forensic perspective, there is no difference between fingerprinting and collecting ""biometric information."" The Supreme Court allowed the Maryland law to remain in effect in July while appeals from the state were filed, and Chief Justice John Roberts signaled at the time his tentative support for the measure. ""Collecting DNA from individuals arrested for violent felonies provides a valuable tool for investigating unsolved crimes and thereby helping to remove violent offenders from the general population,"" Roberts wrote. ""Crimes for which DNA evidence is implicated tend to be serious, and serious crimes cause serious injuries. That Maryland may not employ a duly enacted statute to help prevent these injuries constitutes irreparable harm."" Roberts said at the time there was a ""fair prospect"" the Supreme Court would ultimately find in favor of the state on the search and seizure questions. Roberts said the state appeals decision would resonate beyond Maryland because DNA samples taken on the state level ""may otherwise be eligible"" for the FBI's database. ""The decision,"" Roberts said ""renders the database less effective for other states and the federal government."" The Maryland law is set to expire at the end of 2013. A Supreme Court ruling is expected by June. The case is Maryland v. King (12-207)","Court to examine whether police can take DNA samples after arrest .

"(CNN) -- Demonstrators in Amman, Jordan, battled riot police Wednesday in a fury over gas prices. And those who stayed after the tear gas and water cannons were fired did something rare in that nation: They chanted slogans against King Abdullah. The fighting was in the Jabal al Hussein area, along Soukaina -- one of the main roads running through the capital. Hundreds of demonstrators called on the government to reverse its decision to raise fuel and gas prices. Riot police worked to break up the crowd, and most people fled. But a handful stayed and engaged in a standoff with the police, who fired tear gas canisters to try to force the demonstrators back. CNN saw police beat one man and take him away, and also saw plainclothes intelligence officials takk away two young men as demonstrators threw rocks at the police. The protesters who remained chanted for the downfall of the monarchy. Previous protests have left 14 people injured -- 10 of them by police gunfire, Jordan's public security department said. There was also property damage. Jordanians have told CNN that while they are incensed about rising prices and government corruption, they're just as worried about the current situation. Many say they've never been so fearful about the future of their country. Many believe that if the government does not reverse its decision, the kingdom will plunge into chaos. A wave of protests that began in Jordan in December 2010 has recurred sporadically since. Previously on CNN.com: Thousands rally for political change in Jordan . While the demonstrators have often lambasted members of parliament, cursed the prime minister and called for the government to go, they've rarely spoken out against King Abdullah II. While those voices remain a minority, their call is growing as Jordanians throng to public squares to lash out against the government for cutting fuel subsidies, which resulted in higher gas prices. ""Hey Abdullah, don't be fooled, look around and see what happened to your peers,"" one crowd chanted with reference to toppled Arab autocrats. The government, which the king reshuffled under public pressure in early October, announced the price boost for gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene and cooking gas Tuesday. Unleaded gas jumped from about $3.80 to just over $4.25 per gallon. Diesel fuel spiked from about $2.80 to around $3.70 a gallon. Cooking gas prices spiked from just over $9 per canister to more than $14. The government announced a payout to families of just under $600 to soften the blow of the higher prices for the nation's poorest. Pain at the pump is a drag on government approval ratings anywhere. But in Jordan, where the Arab Spring has kept up the pressure on a monarch who is friendly to the West and a stabilizer in the Middle East, a protest could have explosive potential with effects beyond Jordan's borders. The Hashemite kingdom, which has good relations with Israel, is wedged among the Jewish state, Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and serves as a buffer in the region. As in Egypt, Islamists hold powerful political influence in Jordan. But the protesters are people of all backgrounds, including women without veils and men without beards. State news agency Petra reported that there were protests in at least seven municipalities. ""Oh, Abdullah ibn Hussein, where is the people's money? Where?"" people roared at one demonstration. ""Raising the prices will set the country on fire!"" The higher gas prices come on top of high unemployment and inflation. Jordan's teacher's union announced an open-ended strike Wednesday, saying it would last until the government reverses the price hikes. Jordanian demonstrators commonly voice anger about corruption and poverty, accusing those in power of misappropriating government money for personal gain. But as the streets filled, the rhetoric took a caustic turn, dropping the monarch's title and referring to him crudely by first name only, a rare indiscretion in Jordan. ""Hey Abdullah, listen, listen very well, we will kneel to no one but God!"" was one chant, along with, ""God is mightier than all tyrants."" Insulting the king is illegal in Jordan and can result in a prison sentence. King Abdullah does not have a reputation for bloody oppression like Syria's Bashar al-Assad or former Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, and is viewed by many as a benevolent king. He had 20 opposition activists arrested in early October but quickly released them after an international human rights group criticized the move. His recent announcements of concessions to protesters' demands to democratize have not quelled discontent. Prime Minister Abdullah Ensour, in office for just over a month, took to the airwaves Tuesday night to address the protests. He accused Islamists of lying in wait for any opportunity to incite the collapse of a stable government. Speaking of the Islamic Action Front, he said: ""They have been trying to mobilize their people in the streets and prepare themselves for such an eventful day."" He reminded them that they had shown no opposition when Egypt's Islamist president, Mohamed Morsy of the Muslim Brotherhood, had to raise gas prices there. He then appealed to Jordanians not to ""be influenced by these petty attempts."" Ensour has blamed the gas subsidy cuts on budget slashing made necessary by the uprisings in neighboring countries, which have reduced the gasoline supply to Jordan. ""In the past 18 months of the Arab Spring, Jordan has lost between $4 and $5 billion at least as a result of oil stoppage, especially the Egyptian gas supplies,"" Petra quoted Ensour as saying. It has put the country's budget deficit through the roof, he said. In the past two years, King Abdullah has fired four prime ministers. In February 2011, shortly before Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was forced out of office following weeks of intense protest, the king dismissed his government and ordered ""genuine political reform,"" the country's royal court reported. Political reforms would mean taking power away from his base -- the Bedouin tribes, a group known as the East Bankers. On top of that concern, the king is also dealing with more than 200,000 Syrian refugees who have entered Jordan recently, fleeing despotism in the neighboring country. CNN's Josh Levs, Ahmed Al-Assad, Raja Razek and Hamdi Alkhshali and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.","Some of the protesters battle riot police .

"(EW.com) -- ""Nashville,"" the best-reviewed new drama of the fall, premiered to solid ratings Wednesday night, while The CW's new action-drama ""Arrow"" set a record for the network. ABC's country music drama delivered 9 million viewers and a 2.8 rating among adults 18-49. That's enough to win the hour in the adult demo, topping CBS' ""CSI"" (10.6 million, 2.6) and the premiere of NBC's new series ""Chicago Fire"" (6.4 million, 1.9). But ""Nashville"" was down 15 percent from the launch of ""Revenge"" in this slot last year. NBC's fire-fighting drama was largely panned by critics and had a disappointing launch, down 21 percent from the debut of ""Law & Order: SVU"" in this slot last fall. (""Nashville"" averaged a score of 84 on Metacritic while ""Chicago Fire"" had a 49). Yet here's something interesting: Of the three dramas in the hour, the Connie Britton series had the weakest audience retention from its first half to its second. ""Chicago Fire"" didn't shed any of its demo rating between its half hours â€” which is pretty rare for a show premiering this late at night. Nashville may have a bigger rating, but ""Chicago Fire"" did a better job of keeping viewers in their seat. Another key debut last night: The CW's ""Arrow' (4 million, 1.3 rating) got off to a fine start. This may not be a huge demo rating for the network, but ""Arrow"" marks The CW's most-watched series debut in total viewers since ""The Vampire Diaries"" in 2009. The CW's mission this season is to attract a broader audience than just the ""Gossip Girl""/""90210"" female 18-34 crowd, and hitting 4 million viewers certainly helps. The performance is also impressive considering the network's numbers have been soft the past couple weeks. It's always tougher to jump start a cold engine. ""Arrow"" also gave ""Supernatural"" (2.6 million, 1.0) a boost at 9 p.m., spiking the veteran drama to its biggest audience in two years. 'Arrow' debut: Its aim is true . Fox topped the night in the adult demo thanks to a steady ""The X-Factor"" (9.4 million, 3.4). CBS was second with ""Survivor"" (9.6 million, 2.6) and ""Criminal Minds"" (11.4 million, 3.0). ABC had ""The Middle"" (7.8 million, 2.4), up 9 percent, and ""The Neighbors"" (6.3 million, 1.9), steady. They were followed by a double tap of Modern Family (12 million, 4.7 and 12.2 million, 4.9), down between 11 and 15 percent. 'Parks and Rec': Christie Brinkley in as... The Neighbors has clearly emerged as the weak link in the network's Wednesday comedy chain, but last night also suggested the show might be stabilizing since it did not drop this week. This puts ABC in a tough position. The aliens-next-door sitcom doesn't have a terrible number by this fall's standards, but you don't want to have anything potentially dragging down your top-rated comedy, ""Modern Family."" NBC also had ""Animal Practice"" (3.9 million, 1.1), Guys With Kids (4.2 million, 1.4) and ""SVU"" (6.2 million, 1.8). See the original article at EW.com.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Laith repeats my question back to me, chuckling. ""What is the Iraqi media saying about the US elections?"" He pauses, thinking how best to answer. ""Man, the situation is so bad now, we only pay attention to staying alive."" He laughs again. An Iraqi journalist who works for several international news organizations, Laith tells me that he only narrowly escaped being killed by a car bomb the previous day. ""If I had been a few minutes late for work, you wouldn't be able to talk to me."" Laith chuckles again like so many people do in Baghdad, a resilient, tough, warm laugh. It's been nine years since the United States and its allies invaded Iraq and toppled Saddam Hussein. And although the war officially ended when American combat troops withdrew at the end of 2011, it's far from peace time here. Postcard: ""Ignore us at your peril,"" Afghans say . Although violence in Iraq is down significantly since 2006 and 2007, bombings, kidnappings, and assassinations are part of everyday life across the country. The Iraq Body Count database estimates that seven people have been killed every single day by suicide and car bomb attacks this year. The bomb that missed Laith killed at least seven people . At 6:30 a.m. the following morning, I'm met more with confusion than humor when I ask the same thing of a group of day laborers in the rundown neighborhood of Bataween. ""We only watch football,"" says one man. ""We don't care about elections."" In fact, only one of the workers in the group of 40 or so standing around even knows that there's an election going on in the United States. Rayad Salam, a 25-year-old from Nasiriya, catches my attention. Like everyone else on the corner, he is wearing a generic threadbare soccer tracksuit, the ubiquitous uniform of the terminally poor. Postcard: Athenians fear what follows U.S. election . Rayad came to Baghdad after graduating from university with a degree in Classical Arabic. He wanted to be a teacher, but couldn't find a job back home so came to the capital to work. Rayad makes 25,000 IQD day ($20) if he manages to find work, which he only does about three days a week. He tells me he'll take any kind of work, including the most dangerous job in Iraq: policeman. When I ask him why, his answer is so universal it could have come from any one of the millions of Americans still suffering from the financial crisis: ""All I want is a job so I can take care of my family."" He leans forward to tell me something else, but a middle aged man pushes his way through the crowd and tells me I'd better leave. The group standing around me is drawing attention to itself and we're now making a perfect target for a bomb attack. Traffic squeezes its way around Baghdad's clogged streets, which are pinched every few miles by military checkpoints where bored soldiers lazily hold metal rods â€” nicknamed ""Solomon's cane"" â€” next to passing cars, in the hope they will ""sniff"" out hidden bombs. Postcard: Should U.S. raise fist to Cuba? The cars gridlocked in traffic make it clear that although Baghdad is still dangerous, it certainly isn't poor. Among the old and beat up vehicles are plenty of brand new Land Cruisers, Pajeros, BMW X series, and black Hummer H3s. These are not the armored versions that move in convoys from fortified location to fortified location -- they are the personal cars of the city's middle class. In the evenings the city's wealthy roam the streets of Karada, in the center of the city, where the lights shine almost as bright as Times Square. Here you can indulge in handmade ice cream, or splash out on the latest European fashions. With oil exports in Iraq at a 30-year high (August's revenues were $8.4 billion), a lot of well-positioned people are getting extremely wealthy. More: Get latest news at CNN Election HQ . Here there is a vague understanding of the two different candidates for those that watch the international Arab language channels such as Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya. Not surprisingly, Bush's party is deeply unpopular. Toma Zaki Zahroon, a leader of the Mandean ethnic minority, explains that the ""Republicans make trouble for the U.S. Republicans will create tension with the Arab world."" Someone else tells me, ""Obama is a peaceful man, but if Romney is elected he'll damage Arabs. I don't know his policy but when I see his face he looks like the devil."" The most nuanced view, however, comes from Sheikh Jawad Al-Khalisi, a highly respected Shiite religious leader: ""There's not a big difference between Democrats and Republicans. I don't trust either candidate because they are both influenced by lobbyists. U.S. policy is actually against the American people. In 2003 Americans protested against the war, but they weren't heard."" Postcard: Why India longs for U.S. election . Baghdadis don't trust U.S. politicians, but neither do they trust their own. ""The government is full of thieves,"" 23-year-old Karar tells me in his home in Hurriya, a dangerous neighborhood in northwest Baghdad. Corruption, in fact, is what most Baghdadis talk about when they talk politics. Iraq's parliament is in a constant state of dysfunction; warring coalitions block each other at every turn and assassinations and police brutality are used as political tools. Karar doesn't care for politics. He's a college kid whose life is dominated by working, studying, and just surviving. A year ago he was injured in a bomb attack in his neighborhood and then just a few weeks ago another bomb went off near his house, killing three of his friends. Karar tells me all of this in a very matter-of-fact way, and I ask him why he seems so unaffected by it. ""I feel sad. I'm so sorry about their families. But what can I do? This is normal for us. If you see your friend today, you don't see him tomorrow."" As he pauses, the electricity cuts out and the ceiling fan stops turning. Even with the oil exports, new cars, and imported fashions, basic services in Baghdad are still terrible. On average Baghdadis receive eight to 12 hours of national electricity a day, which makes life in the summer -- when temperatures easily reach 120 degrees -- almost unbearable. Even in September, once the ceiling fan has stopped rotating, the room immediately begins to heat up. Karar gestures at everyone sitting in the room sweating and he finally answers my question about what he thinks of the U.S. election. ""I don't think that a change of American presidents will have any effect on Iraq,"" he says and then a huge grin spreads across his face and he starts to laugh that unique, resilient Baghdadi laugh.","U.S. troops withdrew last year, but the violence continues in Baghdad .

"(CNN) -- Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton has become the latest high-profile British sports star to regret a hastily dashed off tweet after lashing out at McLaren teammate Jenson Button on Twitter . Hamilton accused fellow Briton Button of ""unfollowing"" him -- not subscribing to his tweets -- on the micro-blogging site, before later discovering his colleague had never followed him. The tweets were sent just hours after the conclusion of the Japanese Grand Prix, where Button finished one place above Hamilton in fourth position. The 2008 world champion Hamilton will leave McLaren at the end of the 2012 season to join German team Mercedes in a three-year deal. ""Just noticed @jensonbutton unfollowed, thats a shame. After 3 years as teammates, I thought we respected one another but clearly he doesn't,"" tweeted Hamilton from his personal account, which has over one million followers. He went on to add: ""Funny thing is, we are STILL teammates! All good tho, I plan on giving this team & fans all I got til I cross the finish line in Brazil!!!"" Hamilton is currently fourth in the drivers' standings, 42 points behind Ferrari's championship leader Fernando Alonso. Button is sixth, 31 points adrift of his colleague. The 27-year-old later retracted the outburst, saying: ""My bad, just found out Jenson never followed me. Don't blame him! Need to be on Twitter more!"" It is not the first time Hamilton has fallen foul of an over eager tweet. Earlier this season he had to remove a Twitter post that had divulged sensitive team information. Hamilton's latest Twitter mishap comes days after England soccer player Ashley Cole used the website to aim an insult at the Football Association (FA). Cole was reacting to an FA report which outlined the reasons why the organization hit Chelsea captain John Terry with a four-match ban and a $356,000 fine for racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand. The evidence given by Cole, a teammate of Terry's, during the disciplinary process had been criticized in the report. The defender, who has been charged with misconduct by the FA, tweeted: ""Hahahahaa, well done #fa I lied did I, #BUNCHOFTWATS"". He later apologized ""unreservedly"". Meanwhile Alonso's Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa hopes his first podium finish since the 2010 Korean Grand Prix will help him to secure his place at the Italian team for next season. The Brazilian has failed to recapture his best form since fracturing his skull in 2009 and his future has been the subject of much speculation in recent months. ""Being back on the podium after almost two years away is just great and I feel really uplifted,"" Massa told a post-race press conference after finishing second behind Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel. ""They have been two tough years for me and, sometimes, a million things go through your mind, some of them bad, but finally I can be happy! It's an important result psychologically and also in terms of my future, at least I think so!""","Lewis Hamilton accuses Jenson Button of ""unfollowing"" him on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- Senegal's Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Ivory Coast had to be abandoned after crowd trouble at the Leopold Senghor Stadium in Dakar. Ivory Coast were leading 2-0 Saturday night and 6-2 on aggregate when the players, including a host of English Premier League stars, had to be escorted from the field by riot police. Didier Drogba put The Elephants ahead in the 51st minute from a free kick before a fan ran on to the pitch in an attempt to confront him. He was wrestled away by security, but it proved the prelude to more sustained trouble after the former Chelsea player increased Ivory Coast's lead from a disputed penalty in the 70th minute. Africa football seeks new era to sort out old problems . Fans started fires in the stands and objects were thrown as the players huddled in the center of the field. After a delay of over half an hour, the match was eventually abandoned, confirmed by the official website of the Senegalese football federation, who said ""the match ended in very sombre circumstances."" Ivory Coast are likely to be awarded the match and with it qualification for the finals of the tournament in South Africa next year. ""The match was halted and the Lions of Senegal will not qualify for the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations. Senegal will now incur a sanction from the Confederation of African Football (CAF),"" said the APS, Senegal's official news agency, AFP reported. EPL champions Manchester City, who had brothers Yaya and Koule Toure in the Ivory Coast line-up, said both players were unhurt. ""City's Yaya and Kolo Toure are both safe after crowd trouble halted play as Senegal hosted the Ivory Coast in Dakar,"" said a statement on the club's official website. ""Disturbances broke out as Didier Drogba put The Elephants 2-0 up, after what was deemed a controversial penalty decision in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier. ""Fires were started in the stands at Stade Leopold Senghor and missiles were launched on to the pitch before the players were escorted to safety."" In other action, reigning champions Zambia prevailed in a marathon penalty shoot-out against Uganda to seal their qualification for next year's tournament in South Africa. A total of 20 spot kicks were required at Uganda's Nelson Mandela stadium in Kampala before the 2012 winners ran out 9-8 winners after losing Saturday's second leg 1-0 (which made the aggregate score 1-1). Captain Christopher Katongo failed to score with Zambia's first effort, before his teammates struck nine consecutive spot kicks to break Ugandan fan's hearts -- their team haven't reached the finals since losing to Ghana in the 1978 final. The Black Stars also booked their place at the tournament thanks to a Afriyie Acquah goal which sealed a 1-0 win over Malawi at the Civo Stadium, Lilongwe and a 3-0 aggregate victory. Nigeria are through to the finals, which get underway on January 19, after a thumping 6-1 (8-3 on aggregate) win over Liberia. Efe Ambrose opened the scoring in the first minute with Ahmed Musa doubling the lead seven minutes before the break. Victor Moses made it 3-0 three minutes into the second half with his Chelsea teammate John Obi Mikel adding a fourth from the penalty spot moments later. Liberia's captain Gebro Duncan compounded the visitor's woes when he was sent off for diving in the 70th minute and two minutes later Ike Uche added Nigeria's fifth. Substitute striker Patrick Wleh scored a consolation goal in the 81st minute before Moses claimed his second and Nigeria's sixth two minutes from the end. Mali also enjoyed a comfortable 4-1 (7-1 on aggregate) win over Botswana. Despite being held to a 0-0 draw, Tunisia are also through to the finals on the away goals rule -- their 2-2 draw in the first leg at the National Stadium in Freetown last month proving enough for the 2004 champions. Morocco completed a resounding 4-0 victory in the second leg of their qualifier against Mozambique to win 4-2 on aggregate.","Fan violence forces abandonment of match between Senegal and Ivory Coast .

"(CNN) -- A Mexican man pleaded guilty on Tuesday to first degree murder in the death of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry, the first conviction in a case with an indirect link to the politically charged ""Fast and Furious"" gun-running operation. Manuel Osorio-Arellanes, 36, admitted that on the night of December 14, 2010, he and four others were looking for drug traffickers to rob them of marijuana. The group encountered Terry and other Border Patrol agents along Arizona's border with Mexico and a gun battle broke out. Seeking justice for Brian Terry . In his plea agreement, Osorio-Arellanes agreed the shot that killed Terry was fired by a member of his group although he did not claim to have personally fired the shot or blame someone else specifically for the crime. The Terry case has been controversial because two rifles from the ""Fast and Furious"" operation were found at the scene of his killing. But U.S. officials have not produced evidence proving that Terry was killed with either of those guns. Osorio-Arellanes was wounded and arrested at the scene. He appeared in court in Tucson on Tuesday to plead guilty to one count of first degree murder. As part of the deal prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty and dropped other charges against him. He faces up to life in prison when sentenced in January. Four others were charged with roles in the gun battle and Terry's death, including one who was captured in Mexico in September and is awaiting extradition. The other three remain at large. ""Agent Terry was killed in the line of duty courageously safeguarding our border,"" said Laura Duffy, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California.

"(CNN) -- Yume-Hotaru's first novel was a best-seller in Japanese bookstores, and he wrote it entirely with his thumbs. Publishers in Japan were quick to see the potential of putting cellphone novels into print. The 22-year-old who would rather be identified by his pen name than his real one (Yume-Hotaru means ""Dreaming Firefly"" in Japanese) started composing the novel on his cell phone in 2007. Between classes, on the bus or before going to bed at night, he would type single sentences into his phone's tiny keypad, uploading each one straight to the mobile social networking site Mobage-town. The more Yume-Hotaru posted, the more popular his story became. It won a prize and soon publishers approached him, asking if he wanted to turn his digital book into a paper one. By early 2008, his novel ""First Experience,"" a story about love and sex in high school, was a top title in one of Tokyo's biggest bookstores. Since it emerged in Japan nearly a decade ago, the cell phone novel, or keitai shosetsu, has moved from a little-known subgenre to a mainstream literary phenomenon. Keitai shosetsu sites boast billions of monthly users while publishers sell millions of copies of cellular stories taken from phones and turned into paperback. It is even spreading to other countries as other cultures start to take part in a type of composition long considered purely Japanese. As the name suggests, cell phone novels are written entirely on handsets and posted on sites like Maho no i-rando (Magic Island), the first and largest mobile novel portal in Japan. The site has a million titles, 3.5 billion monthly visitors and six million registered users, according to the company. Mobile readers instantly see new chapters as they are added, often adding comments about the direction they think a novel should take. The diary-like stories are written and read mostly by young women in their teens and 20's. Many authors use pen names and claim their stories are at least partially autobiographical. The novels often center on themes that are rarely discussed aloud in Japanese society -- drugs, sex, pregnancy, abortion, rape and disease. ""When they write those novels, they share their secret, personal problems, and when they read by mobile phones, they can hide what they are reading,"" explained Toshie Takahashi, an associate professor of media studies at Rikkyo University in Tokyo. ""They are also involved and engaged with their mobile phones very strongly,"" added Takahashi, noting that 96 percent of high school students own a cell phone in Japan. ""The mobile phone itself is embedded in young people's everyday lives very deeply and also emotionally and physically."" Despite its popularity among young women, a male writer known as Yoshi, widely considered the first cellular novelist, brought the burgeoning genre to light when he self-published ""Deep Love"" in 2002. The story about a prostitute in Tokyo sold nearly 3 million copies and was adapted for film, television and Manga, or Japanese comics. Publishing phenomenon . A struggling Japanese publishing industry was quick to take notice of the growing popularity of keitai shosetsu, especially early works like Yoshi's ""Deep Love."" Many of the popular cell phone novels have since been turned into paperbacks, and bookstores across Japan now have entire sections devoted to the digital-age literary genre. By 2007, half of the country's 10 best-selling novels were written on cell phones, according to book distributor Tohan while last year mobile novels and comics were a $240 million market in Japan, which is over 5 percent of the country's $4.5 billion total mobile content market, according to Japan's Mobile Content Forum. In January 2009, three Japanese mobile phone novel publishers reported collective sales of 1.7 million copies. Publishers, like Goma Books, one of the first to print cell phone novels, have also launched their own keitai shosetsu sites, which they use to sift through for talent whose work will be marketable on bookshelves. Goma's mobile story site Orion carries 20,000 novels and has approximately two million monthly users, according to the company. Goma has also published several top-selling keitai shosetsu, including ""The Red Thread,"" by Mei (also a pen name). Since it was released in 2007, the story, which revolves around the romance of two middle school students, has sold nearly 2 million copies and was adapted for a TV series and movie last December. The publishing house now prints a new mobile novel every month. Some literary purist don't think the cell phone novels constitute real literature, but their popularity is undeniable. ""The sentences may be a bit immature. It doesn't have a major plot line sometimes. It is just love stories of ordinary high school girls, said Aya Tanaka, a spokesperson for Goma. ""But it is kind of like popular comics, it is what the teenagers want to read, and for the publishers, it is quite a big market and it does sell."" Michael Keferl, a trend consultant with Cscout Japan in Tokyo, believes that ""[readers] are participating in the creation of the novel, which is one of the reasons why they buy it afterwards. They are helping to write it and are also witnessing it being written."" Crossing cultures . However some believe the future of keitai shosetsu as one that is quickly following in the footsteps of most teenage fads: A sudden and rapid rise to mass popularity followed by a slow but steady decline to the fringes of the not-so-cool. Last year few mobile novels appeared on best-seller lists while new stories published online have lost their characteristic edginess, said Chiaki Ishihara, a Japanese literature expert at Waseda University in Tokyo who has studied cell phone novels. ""Keitai shosetsu is rapidly declining at this point,"" Ishihara told CNN. ""In a few years, it may not even be considered a subculture."" Others see the cell phone novel moving from an initial boom that peaked around 2007 to a period of market stabilization. ""You are not going to have as many of the big hits as you had before because there are so many titles out,"" said Keferl. ""Things are leveling out now."" While the cell  phone novel market may be cooling in Japan, it is just starting to emerge in other countries, like the United States, where faster networks and cheaper data plans are leading more consumers to use handsets in ways similar to people in Japan. Many companies are starting to launch mobile web sites in the U.S., including DeNA, the Japanese firm that owns Mobage-town, the site where Yume-Hotaru writes his keitai shosetsu. ""What has surprised us is users in America are behaving in a similar way to the Japanese,"" said Dai Watanabe, president of DeNA Global, Inc. ""They are writing about things that are very close to their actual lives. I was surprised to see it is very similar with what is happening in Japan."" Julian Knighten, a 22-year-old who works three jobs, writes his cell phone stories while lying in bed at night in his home outside of Dallas, Texas. He said he had never heard of keitai shosetsu before but likes writing cell phone novels because of the relationship he has with readers and the feedback they give him about his stories. ""It encourages me to write,"" said Knighten. ""And it gives me the chance to escape reality.""","Hugely popular cell phone novels have created new market for publishers in Japan .

"(CNN) -- The SpaceX Dragon was successfully berthed at the International Space Station on Wednesday as the station's crew caught and secured the unmanned cargo capsule high above Earth, NASA announced. Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide latched onto Dragon with a robotic arm at 6:56 a.m. ET. By 9:03, the craft was attached to the station's docking module, the space agency said. ""Looks like we've tamed the Dragon,"" NASA's Sunita Williams, commander of the current ISS mission, said in a statement released by SpaceX. The Dragon mission lifted off Sunday carrying about a half ton of supplies for the station's crew. It caught up with the ISS Wednesday morning, 273 miles over the South Atlantic Ocean, NASA said. ""This is a big moment in the course of this mission and for commercial spaceflight,"" SpaceX founder Elon Musk said in a statement released by the company. ""We are pleased that Dragon is now ready to deliver its cargo to the International Space Station."" It's one of a dozen missions ordered by NASA under a contract with the company. A Dragon capsule successfully delivered 1,000 pounds of cargo to the station in May. NASA says the ISS crew will start unloading the craft on Thursday. Dragon will be attached to the station for two and a half weeks. After the supplies are pulled off, astronauts will reload the craft with scientific experiments and failed equipment that can be repaired and sent back. It's scheduled to return to Earth on October 28. The Dragon remained on course despite engine trouble on its booster after liftoff Sunday night. A minute and 19 seconds after the Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, one of its nine Merlin engines ""lost pressure suddenly,"" the company disclosed Monday. The rocket ""did exactly what it was designed to do,"" as its flight computer made adjustments to keep the Dragon headed into the proper orbit, the company said. However, a communications satellite the Falcon 9 carried as a secondary payload did not end up in its designated orbit. In a statement issued Wednesday afternoon, SpaceX said it had to use more fuel and liquid oxygen to put the Dragon into orbit because of the failed engine. ""For the protection of the space station mission, NASA had required that a restart of the upper stage only occur if there was a very high probability (over 99%) of fully completing the second burn,"" SpaceX said. ""While there was sufficient fuel on board to do so, the liquid oxygen on board was only enough to achieve a roughly 95% likelihood of completing the second burn, so Falcon 9 did not attempt a restart."" The satellite, built by New Jersey-based satellite firm Orbcomm, was supposed to have been carried into a higher orbit by the Falcon 9's second stage. Orbcomm said Monday that its satellite was circling in a lower-than-intended orbit, and it was trying to determine whether the satellite's own propulsion systems could carry it the rest of the way up. SpaceX said it was studying flight data with NASA to figure out what happened, ""and we will apply those lessons to future flights."" Initial readings indicated that an engine fairing broke apart under stress, it said Monday. Despite that problem, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden called Sunday's launch and the mission ""a critical event in space flight."" And SpaceX, which Musk founded in 2002, is looking beyond cargo flights to develop a version of the Dragon that would carry astronauts to the ISS. It's one of three companies, along with Sierra Nevada and aerospace giant Boeing, that NASA has chosen to work on the project. Within the next few months, Orbital Sciences is expected to fly its own demonstration flight to the space station. Instead of using Cape Canaveral as its launch site, the company's rocket will take off from Wallops Island, off the coast of Virginia. Orbital has a nearly $2 billion contract with NASA for station resupply missions. In 2008, NASA chose SpaceX's Falcon 9 launch vehicle and the Dragon spacecraft to resupply the space station after the space shuttle program was retired. The space agency plans to turn much of its focus toward exploring deep into the solar system. ""The $1.6 billion contract represents a minimum of 12 flights, with an option to order additional missions for a cumulative total contract value of up to $3.1 billion,"" SpaceX says on its website.","The SpaceX Dragon was successfully ""tamed,"" the ISS commander says .

"Shanghai (CNN) -- The only souvenir that Xie Jinghua has from her stay at a Holiday Inn Express located in a vast tourism park alongside the East China Sea is a room key. The 52-year-old said she was not able to buy any of the beach toys in the lobby, walk around a lake nearby, or enjoy the ocean just outside of her window. Xie was there, she said, because she was forced to be - held in a hotel room for eight days after she and her 56-year-old husband, Ma Haiming, traveled to Beijing in March to protest the compensation they were given for the demolition of the family's farmhouse to make way for the expansion of Shanghai's Pudong International Airport in 2005. When the couple arrived in Beijing, Xie said they were picked up by plain clothes police and forced to travel hundreds of miles back to Shanghai, then held separately at the hotel. ""I really felt quite sick inside,"" said Xie, who now lives in a tiny apartment near the airport where her son works as a janitor. Xie said she tried to escape from her third floor hotel room on March 10 via its balcony but was stopped by at least seven guards who, she said, ""put me on the bed and used the bedspread"" to hold her down. She said she stole the room key when a guard was not looking. Xie and her husband were not alone. Three other people have told CNN they were held against their will at the Holiday Inn Express Nanhuizui - located in Lingang New City on the outskirts of Shanghai - to keep them from airing grievances to the central government during the 10-day annual meeting of China's legislature in March. The hotel management and owners deny their claims. But people being detained without charge is nothing new in China, according to Human Rights Watch, which says authorities use hotels, homeless shelters, mental health facilities, farmhouses and obscure government compounds as so-called ""black jails"" -- unofficial prisons where Chinese officials hold citizens without charge. However activists say this is the first time a facility run by a western company has been allegedly used for these unofficial detentions. ""I have not come across an American branded hotel being used as a black jail,"" said Phelim Kine, a senior Asia researcher with the New York-based Human Rights Watch. ""That is a first, and it is noteworthy."" The InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG), the UK-based firm that owns the Holiday Inn Express brand, said there was no indication that guests at the hotel were being held against their will last March. ""We have found no evidence which would confirm these accusations or any sign that the hotel owner knew or cooperated with (the) government on this hotel stay and the hotel is operated in accordance with PRC [People's Republic of China] local laws and regulations,"" IHG said in a statement, noting that it had conducted a ""thorough investigation"" of the allegations. ""As you'll appreciate, we can't provide details of the booking or guests due to privacy laws."" 'Black jails' in China . According to a 2009 Human Rights Watch report on China's alleged ""black jails,"" local courts often refuse to take cases from residents who have complaints against local officials, which means petitioning Beijing is the only option those residents have. But their trips to Beijing present a major problem for local officials, who face demotions or other forms of retribution from higher levels of government based on the number of petitioners who come to Beijing, according to Human Rights Watch. As a result, local governments intervene, abducting the petitioners either before they leave or once they arrive in Beijing, Kine said. The forced detention of dissidents has become its own cottage industry as public security offices subcontract people to work for them who ""are paid per head for each person that they abduct and hold,"" Kine added. ""This is a huge grey economy."" As Communist Party officials meet this week to decide China's new leadership, outside will be people like Wang Yifeng and Fan Jianjiang who are petitioning government leaders directly for compensation after the demolition of their homes. Both Wang and Fan are among the five interviewed by CNN who said they attempted to make their case last March, but were intercepted by police who took them into custody and held them in the Holiday Inn Express Nanhuizui. Human rights groups say detentions without charge are common, particularly during times of central government meetings. ""We always expect that around significant political events that there will be a tightening of surveillance and control over key individuals who the government considers to be troublemakers,"" said Catherine Baber, director of Asia Pacific for Amnesty International. ""But certainly in the lead up to the transition, there is a growing list of people who are under house arrest."" ""Phenomenal resources are used for keeping tabs on [petitioners],"" Baber said. ""Detaining them and bringing them back, putting them under surveillance, sending them to reeducation through labor [camps]."" A spokeswoman for IHG said that during the time in question a group of rooms were booked by a government official from the Pudong district of Shanghai. That area is home to the five alleged detainees. They say their movements are constantly monitored by security officials in their home district after years of appealing for better compensation for their properties. According to the five, local officials have either intercepted them before they arrived in Beijing to make their petitions or tracked them down in the capital and sent them on the 665-mile journey back to the Shanghai area, where they were held. An official at the Petition Bureau of Zhuqiao Town, home of the five petitioners, denied their claims. ""I don't know what you are talking about, our channels of petitioning are open,"" said the official, who declined to give his name when he was reached by phone. ""There's no such thing."" CNN contacted China's Ministry of Public Security on November 5 for a response to these claims, but there has not yet been a reply. However, in the past, Beijing has denied the existence of so-called ""black jails"" in China. The central government also last year issued new regulations outlawing violent forced eviction and offering new protections, including fair compensation. 'Violent forced evictions' But rights groups say problems remain. ""Violent forced evictions in China are on the rise as local authorities seek to offset huge debts by seizing and then selling off land in suspect deals with property developers,"" according to an October report by Amnesty International, called ""Standing Their Ground."" The 85-page report also said there is ineffective redress for Chinese citizens like Xie and her husband, who - without cash to hire legal help - petition the central government directly with local grievances that range from allegations of illegal land seizures and forced evictions to corruption and abuse from local authorities. They often face weeks or sometimes years of forced detentions without charge, human rights groups say. ""From our research and research from domestic Chinese human rights [groups], they are held from a few days to several months and routinely subjected to physical abuse, sleep deprivation and very often they have to buy their way out of custody,"" Kine said. ""The government has denied there are any such black jail facilities in China. Even though [Chinese] state media run stories about black jails, there is an official disconnect."" Baber at Amnesty International said it is hard to quantify the number of people who are detained illegally in China, but ""it is a large phenomenon,"" she said. ""Just from the volume of people who put their energies into pursuing petitioning and continue to do so. It will be a large problem still."" Petitioner: Kept under guard . Xie said there were several guards posted outside of her Holiday Inn Express room and two women who were living in the room with her whose job was to monitor her. She said while held at the hotel, she was told she would be given ""classes about petitioner regulations."" But there were no classes, she added. Xie took a reporter to the hotel to show where she was allegedly detained. The rooms were neatly furnished, with a flat screen TV and abstract art hanging on the walls. When the front desk worker was asked whether they were aware people had allegedly been held against their will in the hotel, the employee said there were a number of guests who were staying in their rooms and were not leaving, and there were people standing outside their room, but that they had no idea why. IHG said they interviewed all employees at the hotel in June after being first contacted by CNN, none of whom confirmed this story. A review of hotel security tapes was impossible, the hotel said, because recordings are erased after one month. The hotel had the employees sign affidavits attesting to their version of events, a hotel spokeswoman said. ""IHG is committed to operating our company with integrity and we have a Human Rights Policy applicable across the business. We have signed up to the UN Global Compact, aligning our operations and strategies with the ten universal principles that include commitments to human rights and labor standards,"" IHG said in its statement. ""Our staff is trained to handle different situations and were a situation to arise, our staff would report an incident to the relevant authorities and IHG."" China has become a leading market for the InterContinental Hotels Group, which owns the Holiday Inn Express, Intercontinental and Crowne Plaza brands. Greater China led its first half, with a 9.7% increase in revenue per available rooms. IHG, headquartered outside London, generates revenue from 181 hotels in greater China, with plans to open 160 more hotels, according to the company. IHG's local partner in the hotel is Shanghai Harbor City Hotel Investment and Management Co.-- a subsidiary of Shanghai Harbor City Development Group. Like most of IHG's properties in China, a local partner legally owns the hotel but IHG manages the property. Zhu Gang, a manager with Shanghai Harbor City Development, said the company ""knows nothing about"" people being detained at the Holiday Inn Express. ""No violence happened in the hotel,"" he said.

"(MNN) -- Consider it an occupational hazard. Work at a veterinary clinic long enough, and eventually you will wind up falling for a patient. In the case of veterinary technician Christina Simpson, she fell for a patient that had been left behind at her roommate's veterinary clinic. Oreo's owner surrendered the dog because the animal could no longer use her hind legs. After hearing about Oreo, Simpson offered to try laser therapy. The procedure promotes healing at the cellular level by increasing blood flow and decreasing inflammation in the injured area, and had been used successfully by Simpson's colleagues at Eagle's Landing Veterinary Hospital in Georgia. Simpson was so sure laser therapy would work that she took responsibility for the perky pooch, renaming her Hope. ""I wanted to try to get her walking again with the laser,"" she says. ""I was hopeful I could do that and adopt her out, but once it became clear she wasn't going to walk again, it became difficult."" By that point, she had fallen for Hope. But with a roommate and a house full of pets, Simpson had no room for another addition. The vet tech decided the next best thing to taking Hope home was to move to Plan B: Build a wheelchair so the dog could get around and — hopefully — find a forever home. MNN: More amazing advances in veterinary medicine . How do you build a wheelchair for a dog? For Simpson, it was time to surf the Web and reach out to her friends. Firefighter Clay Gaddy, whose wife works with Simpson, downloaded instructions to transform 1-inch PVC pipe, foam insulation and a pair of lawn mower wheels into Hope's new ride. Eagle's Landing Veterinary Hospital paid for the supplies and, a few hours later, Gaddy was fitting the dog for her new wheelchair. The first ride was a bit bumpy and required some adjustments, but soon Hope was off in pursuit of a stuffed toy. Fortunately for Hope and other dogs with disabilities, there is no shortage of information to help people care for animals with special needs. On HandicappedPets.com, pet owners offer advice, purchase gear and share words of encouragement. Customers regularly submit video footage of their dogs thriving, and the site's Facebook fan page has more than 48,000 members. It was created in 2000 by Mark Robinson, who had sold pet supplies and wheelchairs for years. ""People who were caring for disabled animals were feeling very alone and neglected,"" says Robinson. ""Friends and neighbors would say, 'Aww, put the poor thing to sleep,' but these people knew their dog was alive, awake, happy — they just couldn't walk. They had nowhere to go for support."" MNN: Dogs get decked out for 'Howl-o-ween' Community feedback led Robinson to invent the Walkin Wheels adjustable wheelchair, which is available in 22 countries, including Australia, France and — coming soon — Iran. A mini version accommodates dogs that weigh less than 20 pounds and ranges from $249 to $325, while the standard version works for dogs up to 180 pounds. Prices range from $399 to $529. Upon hearing Hope's story, HandicappedPets.com offered Simpson a travel-friendly Walkin Wheels to keep Hope moving in the right direction. Now, all Hope needs is a forever home. Eagle's Landing has agreed to board her until Simpson finds the right family, one that can handle the challenges of a pet with special needs. In the meantime, Hope is adjusting to her new wheels. ""It's hard to keep up with [Hope] when she makes up her mind,"" Simpson says. ""Her front end is all muscle so she's a great candidate for a wheelchair.""

"(CNN) -- Fighting spread through Syria on Saturday as rebels claimed to down a government jet and state media reported the killings of ""terrorists."" Activists said rebels shot down the plane in Aleppo province. A video distributed by activists shows men shouting ""God is great"" as they rush to the scene amid celebratory gunfire. The video showed mangled wreckage, small fires and plumes of smoke. ""These are the aircrafts of the dog Bashar al-Assad,"" one voice in the video said, referring to Syria's president. Col. Ahmed Al-Faj, a Free Syrian Army rebel commander, read a statement in a YouTube video claiming responsibility for the downing. He said the plane was an Aero L-39 Albatros. In another video, rebel fighters in the Damascus suburbs claimed they took over an airbase brigade building after clashes. At least 141 people were killed across the country Saturday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Many of them were women, children and members of the rebel Free Syrian Army, according to the group. Of the dead, 30 died in Damascus and its suburbs and 17 were killed in Idlib province. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said al-Assad's forces killed ""scores of terrorists"" in operations across the country, while capturing or destroying heavy weaponry and ammunition-laden vehicles in Aleppo and other areas. An estimated 30,000 people have been killed in fighting in Syria since March 2011 when government protesters took to the streets calling for political reform. Al-Assad's brutal crackdown on protesters spawned an armed conflict, which has bled over into Turkish territory. Meanwhile, rebel forces pressed toward the government-controlled Baba Amr district of Homs, where shelling continued in the embattled city, an opposition activist said. ""Everyday there are firefights between the regime and the FSA (Free Syria Army) in the Sultaniya neighborhood,"" said opposition spokesman Abu Bakr. ""The FSA has a lot of battalions in Homs. There are many dead from both the regime and the FSA."" He added that ""very few civilians remain in the neighborhoods around Homs."" ""Three or four families live in Sultaniya, on one small street,"" he said, noting that the electricity remains out and potable water is largely unavailable. ""The houses are all destroyed, there is nowhere else for people to live."" Historic Umayyad Mosque burning . Amid the clashes, Aleppo's landmark Umayyad Mosque caught fire, according to activists who say security forces took over the mosque, ""set it on fire from inside, and ran away."" Mohammed Saeed, an activist in Aleppo, told CNN that he saw the Syrian Army enter the mosque and ignite the building. There was no immediate government reaction to the opposition claims. State news reported, however, that security forces did eliminate a large number of ""terrorists"" in operations targeting their gatherings around the mosque. Aleppo is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, dominated by an ancient citadel. The city also is a center for the art and was named Islamic capital of culture six years ago. UNESCO's director-general expressed concern this week for possible damage to the mosque, the remains of which date to the 12th century. ""I am deeply distressed by the daily news about the extreme human suffering and the escalation of damage to cultural heritage throughout the country. We saw damage to the Citadel in July and the souqs 10 days ago, and the Umayyad Mosque, heart of the religious life of the city, one of the most beautiful mosques in the Muslim world, is being severely endangered -- the extent of which we do not know yet,"" Irina Bokova said Thursday. Turkey to Syria: Don't send arms through our air space . Envoy visis Turkey amid escalating tensions . The joint U.N.-Arab League envoy to Syria visited Turkey on Saturday for talks aimed at putting a lid on boiling diplomatic tensions between Damascus and Ankara. Lakhdar Brahimi's visit comes amid growing concern that the civil war could spill over into Syria's neighboring countries and destabilize the region. Brahimi met with Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who warned that Turkey ""will retaliate again if its border with Syria is violated again and if we feel that Turkey's national security is in danger."" Meanwhile, Syria issued a ban Saturday on Turkish civilian airlines flying over Syrian airspace ""based on the principle of reciprocity,"" according to a Foreign Ministry statement. The move comes one day after Turkey itself announced it will divert its planes to avoid Syrian airspace because it considers it unsafe. Syrian refugees in Turkey get food aid . The U.N. World Food Programme started an electronic food card program for the thousands of Syrian refugees who've fled to Turkey. Each Syrian family will receive an electronic card with 80 Turkish liras, or $45, per family member per month. ""It allows Syrian families to shop and cook for themselves based on their own tastes and preferences,"" says Jean-Yves Lequime, WFP Emergency Coordinator in Turkey. Turkey is currently hosting more than 93,000 Syrian refugees in camps. Turkish officials estimate an additional 40,000 to 50,000 unofficial refugees live in Turkey outside refugee camps.

"(CNN) -- Update: Felix Baumgartner landed safely on Earth after jumping from 128,000 feet. I will always wonder what it was like to huddle around a shortwave radio and through the crackling static from space hear the faint beeps of the world's first satellite -- Sputnik. I also missed watching Neil Armstrong step foot on the moon and the first space shuttle take off for the stars. Those events were way before my time. As a kid, I was fascinated with what goes on in the sky, and when NASA pulled the plug on the shuttle program I was heartbroken. Yet the privatized space race has renewed my childhood dreams to reach for the stars. As a meteorologist, I've still seen many important weather and space events, but right now, if you were sitting next to me, you'd hear my foot tapping rapidly under my desk. I'm anxious for the next one: a space capsule hanging from a crane in the New Mexico desert. It's like the set for a George Lucas movie floating to the edge of space. You and I will have the chance to watch a man take a leap into an unimaginable free fall from the edge of space -- live. Tuesday, I sat at work glued to the live stream of the Red Bull Stratos Mission. I watched the balloons positioned at different altitudes in the sky to test the winds, knowing that if they would just line up in a vertical straight line ""we"" would be go for launch. I feel this mission was created for me because I am also a journalist and a photographer, but above all I live for taking a leap of faith -- the feeling of pushing the envelope into uncharted territory. The guy who is going to do this, Felix Baumgartner, must have that same feeling, at a level I will never reach. However, it did not stop me from feeling his pain when a gust of swirling wind kicked up and twisted the partially filled balloon that would take him to the upper end of our atmosphere. As soon as the 40-acre balloon, with skin no thicker than a dry cleaning bag, scraped the ground I knew it was over. How claustrophobia almost grounded supersonic skydiver . With each twist, you could see the wrinkles of disappointment on the face of the current record holder and ""capcom"" (capsule communications), Col. Joe Kittinger. He hung his head low in mission control as he told Baumgartner the disappointing news: Mission aborted. The supersonic descent could happen as early as Sunday afternoon. For the latest updates on timing, check Red Bull's status clock . The weather plays an important role in this mission. Starting at the ground, conditions have to be very calm -- winds less than 2 mph, with no precipitation or humidity and limited cloud cover. The balloon, with capsule attached, will move through the lower level of the atmosphere (the troposphere) where our day-to-day weather lives. It will climb higher than the tip of Mount Everest (5.5 miles/8.85 kilometers), drifting even higher than the cruising altitude of commercial airliners (5.6 miles/9.17 kilometers) and into the stratosphere. As he crosses the boundary layer (called the tropopause), he can expect a lot of turbulence. The balloon will slowly drift to the edge of space at 120,000 feet (22.7 miles/36.53 kilometers). Here, ""Fearless Felix"" will unclip. He will roll back the door. Then, I would assume, he will slowly step out onto something resembling an Olympic diving platform. Below, the Earth becomes the concrete bottom of a swimming pool that he wants to land on, but not too hard. Still, he'll be traveling fast, so despite the distance, it will not be like diving into the deep end of a pool. It will be like he is diving into the shallow end. Skydiver preps for the big jump . When he jumps, he is expected to reach the speed of sound -- 690 mph (1,110 kph) -- in less than 40 seconds. Like hitting the top of the water, he will begin to slow as he approaches the more dense air closer to Earth. But this will not be enough to stop him completely. If he goes too fast or spins out of control, he has a stabilization parachute that can be deployed to slow him down. His team hopes it's not needed. Instead, he plans to deploy his 270-square-foot (25-square-meter) main chute at an altitude of around 5,000 feet (1,524 meters). In order to deploy this chute successfully, he will have to slow to 172 mph (277 kph). He will have a reserve parachute that will open automatically if he loses consciousness at mach speeds. Even if everything goes as planned, it won't. Baumgartner still will free fall at a speed that would cause you and me to pass out, and no parachute is guaranteed to work higher than 25,000 feet (7,620 meters). It might not be the moon, but Kittinger free fell from 102,800 feet in 1960 -- at the dawn of an infamous space race that captured the hearts of many. Baumgartner will attempt to break that record, a feat that boggles the mind.

"(CNN) -- An American Express insurance company is suing a Maryland man, who was accused in the Aruba disappearance of his traveling companion, in an effort to void a $1.5 million insurance policy he took out on her. Amex Assurance Company claims that Gary Giordano does not have a right to collect on the big dollar life insurance policy he obtained on his companion Robyn Gardner because their relationship was ""casual and non-exclusive,"" according to the lawsuit. Giordano, of Gaithersburg, Maryland, was thrust into the spotlight last year when Gardner went missing during the couple's trip in Aruba. Gardner, 35, also of Maryland was last seen August 2, 2011. Giordano told authorities the two were snorkeling when she disappeared and he filed a missing person report. Aruba authorities detained Giordano and held him until late November and said they were suspicious about the $1.5 million life insurance policy he took out on Gardner days before they traveled to the Caribbean island. Giordano, 51, was released because Aruban authorities said they did not have enough evidence and Giordano acknowledged in later interviews that he did inquire about the life insurance policy two days after Gardner disappeared. The lawsuit, filed last week in Maryland federal court, also alleges that Giordano did not tell the truth when he filled out the life insurance form indicating that Gardner was a ""partner."" The two were not married and did not fit any of the other strict definitions the company designates as partner, the lawsuit said. In June, Giordano sued Amex Assurance Company for $3.5 million for the death claim. But ""nowhere in that complaint is there an explanation for defendant Giordano's assertion that he is entitled to recover $3,500,000,"" Amex Assurance Company lawsuit says. The company said it is also seeking damages against Giordano. In an unrelated case, Giordano was arrested in a Maryland parking garage in May for indecent exposure along with a Tennessee woman after police found them unclothed in the back of a Cadillac Escalade. Two passersby complained to a garage employee about the SUV, and when the employee located the vehicle, he observed a woman and man cuddled together, with the man not wearing any clothes, according to an Annapolis Police Department report. Police found the couple partially covered by a blanket and laying on a single mattress in the back of the SUV, and one officer shined his light into the vehicle to gain the couple's attention, the report said. ""While we recognize that Mr. Giordano enjoys an infamous reputation, the Annapolis arrest was simply a matter of effective police work in response to citizen complaints,"" Annapolis Chief Michael Pristoop said at the time. CNN's Arielle Hawkins contributed to this report.","Company says Giordano does not have a right to collect on $1.5 million policy .

"(CNN) -- The outward signs of recovery were everywhere Monday across the Northeast nearly two weeks after Superstorm Sandy struck: Power restored to tens of thousands, bridges and tunnels reopened, and limited train and ferry service up and running. ""After two weeks of the recovery phase, we've achieved a new normal for life in post-Hurricane Sandy New Jersey,"" Gov. Chris Christie said of his state. Nearly everyone in the state has power back, nearly all schools are reopening, and gasoline rationing can end in the state, he said. Ad-hoc army of volunteers feeds those still-powerless after Sandy . But, as officials in the stricken region emphasize, signs of struggle remain. In New York state alone, Sandy inflicted about a $30 billion ""economic loss,"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. For many, that loss and heartache is as fresh as it was when Sandy came ashore. People are still clearing debris from their homes, standing watch among ruins to ward off looters, and putting on layers of clothing to battle the cold. Some have been crying in each other's arms as they face the devastation. Gas rationing continues in New York City and Long Island's Nassau and Suffolk counties. Christie said it will take time to restore necessary services for those who live on New Jersey's barrier islands, because so much infrastructure was destroyed. ""Our resilience has always been our biggest strength,"" Christie said. He said he has seen a lot of pain and tears across the state. But, he added, those suffering losses also say, ""We're rebuilding. We're coming back."" The death toll from Sandy is at least 113 across several states, with 43 of those fatalities in New York City, according to New York's chief medical examiner. Authorities discovered the body of a 66-year-old man who appeared to have drowned in his home on hard-hit Staten Island, while a 77-year-old man from the battered beachside community of Far Rockaway in Queens died of injuries he suffered when he fell down a flight of stairs. Not long after the superstorm, more than 8.6 million people were without power, the U.S. Department of Energy said. As of Sunday morning, that was down to about 160,000 customers. Map: See images of destruction, recovery across the East Coast . In Baldwin Harbor, on New York's Long Island, Paul Walters used a flashlight to survey the storm debris pulled from his home and those of his neighbors: Damaged mattresses, boxes of books and papers, and destroyed floor lamps. But it is the ongoing power outage that has proved most frustrating for Walters, who told CNN affiliate WCBS in New York late Sunday that he was ""frustrated, emotionally drained"" by the experience. Bundled up in a heavy jacket and knit cap, Walters joined hundreds over the weekend in Baldwin Harbor to protest a Long Island Power Authority requirement that every home undergo an inspection before power was returned. The ruling drew the ire of residents, who are battling the cold while trying to clean up their homes. Some residents took to the streets in areas of the Nassau County community with handmade signs. Others chanted: ""Help the harbor. Turn on the power."" Under fire by residents and officials, the Long Island Power Authority rescinded its inspection order. But it did little to curb anger among residents who believe they have been without power unnecessarily. ""It's ridiculous,"" Marilyn Cashdan told WCBS. ""The governor should fire them all."" Cuomo, New York's governor, said for about 58,000 customers in the Rockaways, Long Island and Brooklyn, it's not just a matter of utilities doing their normal restoration work. For them, repairs must be done in and around their homes for electricity to return. ""If you don't have your power back, it probably means power can't be restored to your home at this time,"" he said Monday afternoon. Opinion: Rebuilding after Sandy is too big a risk . LIPA said Monday it has restored service to more than 97% of customers whose homes and business can safely receive power. Over 10,000 linemen and tree trim crews remain at work, meanwhile, for those still in the dark. Another utility Con Edison announced its last New York City customers affected got their power back overnight, while all Westchester County customers had electricity back by Monday. ""The 1 million restorations do not include approximately 16,300 customers in flood-ravaged areas of Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island,"" Con Edison said. ""Those customers cannot get electrical service until their own internal equipment is repaired, tested and certified by an electrician as ready for service,"" the company said on its website. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano visited New York City on Sunday. Though she praised the response to the storm, she recognized that much work remains to be done. ""This is going to be here for the long term. And we are here for the long term as well,"" she said. More than 369,000 people in New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut have registered for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which will total more than $455 million, FEMA said. In his weekly radio address Sunday, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg detailed the city's relief and rebuilding efforts, including the Rapid Repairs program, which sends teams of inspectors, electricians, carpenters and contractors building-to-building to identify repairs needed, help building owners make repairs and get them reimbursed by the federal government for repair work. In that vein, the mayor signed an emergency order Monday waiving all city application and permit fees for those doing Sandy-related repairs. Plus, those buildings with ""significant structural damage"" that will need to be demolished, altered or rebuilt ""will have their repair work fees waived and all fees for electrical and plumbing repair work ... waived."" Bloomberg, along with the city council speaker and city comptroller, later Monday announced a a $500 million ""emergency capital spending plan to make critical repairs to public schools and public hospitals."" This comes after the city authorized $134 million for projects like fixing the Battery Park Overpass, repairing ferry terminals, conducting electrical and water line inspections and removing debris. CNN's James O'Toole, Susan Candiotti and Dominique Dodley contributed to this report.","NEW: New York City OK's $500 million for repairs at city schools and hospitals .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A series of attacks in Iraq killed at least 18 people and wounded dozens Wednesday, police said. A car bomb exploded outside a popular restaurant in Hafriya about 35 km southeast of Baghdad on Wednesday afternoon, according to police and health officials. At last three people were killed and 15 others were wounded, officials said. Hafriya is a predominately Shiite district located in Wasit province. A car bomb targeting a security convoy exploded near two hotels in central Baghdad, killing a person near the scene of the blast and wounding seven others. In Kirkuk, at least nine people were killed -- including five Iraqi soldiers -- and 31 people were wounded when three car bombs exploded in and around the ethnically mixed, oil-rich city north of Baghdad. In the southern Iraqi city Hilla, a car bomb exploded near an outdoor market, killing five people and wounding 12 others. Hilla, which is predominately Shiite, is in Babel Province. In Diyala Province, two roadside bombs and a car bomb, all in different areas, wounded 11 people. One targeted the convoy of Diyala Gov. Omer Aziz al-Hamri, but he wasn't hurt in the incident. Last month, nearly 150 people were killed and 300 others were wounded in violence across the country, according to the interior ministry. Baghdad's Shiite-dominated government has blamed the recent attacks on Sunni insurgents with ties to al Qaeda. Violence has dropped dramatically in Iraq since the peak of Sunni-Shiite clashes in 2006 and 2007 and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country in December 2011, but insurgent attacks against civilians and security forces persist. Many areas are still smoldering with sectarian tension and political infighting. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden called Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki Tuesday night to reaffirm U.S. support of the Iraqi government, al-Maliki's office said.

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Germany are investigating whether they can prosecute a former Nazi camp guard who has been living in the United States for 60 years, they said Monday. Prosecutors are probing the case of Johann Breyer, who admits to having been a guard at the notorious Auschwitz camp, where more than 1 million people, most of them Jews, were killed during World War II. Breyer, 87, says he was only a perimeter guard and did not persecute anyone, according to legal papers related to his battle to keep his U.S. citizenship. ""He was a trained, paid, uniformed armed Nazi guard who patrolled the perimeters of two such camps with orders to shoot those who tried to escape,"" a court ruled in 1994. Breyer won his fight to remain in the United States in 2003, when a court ruled that he was not responsible for having joined a Nazi unit because he was only 17 years old at the time. But German authorities are investigating evidence against him, and expect to have preliminary results in October, said Gert Schaefer, a spokesman for the chief public prosecutor in the Bavarian town of Weiden. Breyer emigrated to the United States in 1952 and claimed citizenship as a displaced person. In the 1990s, the government fought to strip him of his citizenship, arguing that Nazis were not eligible. Breyer did not dispute having been an SS Totenkopf (Death's Head) guard, responsible for guarding Nazi concentration camps, according to the U.S. Court of Appeals of the Third Circuit, which heard one stage of his legal battle in 1994. Therefore, ""Breyer assisted in persecution,"" the court ruled. ""The Department of Justice proved in federal court that John (Johann) Breyer participated in Nazi-sponsored acts of persecution while serving as an SS guard at the Buchenwald Concentration Camp and the Auschwitz Death Camp during World War II,"" DOJ spokeswoman Rebekah Carmichael said Monday in a statement. But, she added, findings about his mother's birth and the date of his SS enlistment made it legally impossible to deport him. His case is similar to that of John Demjanjuk, the Ukrainian-born Ohio man who spent more than two decades fighting charges that he was a Nazi war criminal before he died this year. CNN's Fred Pleitgen and Janina Bembenek contributed to this report.","Johann Breyer was a guard at Auschwitz, where more than 1 million people were killed .

"(CNN) -- A 10-year-old Colorado girl reported missing one week ago is dead, police said Friday, spurring a manhunt for the person who killed her. Westminster Police Chief Lee Birk told reporters that a body found earlier this week ""has been positively identified"" as that of Jessica Ridgeway. ""Our focus has changed from a search for Jessica to a mission of justice for Jessica,"" Birk said. Jessica was last seen by her mother as she left for school October 5. Authorities then issued a statewide Amber Alert for the girl. On Sunday, a man in a subdivision in Superior discovered Jessica's backpack outside his house about 7 miles from the girl's hometown of Westminster, said Westminster Police Investigator Trevor Materasso. Both towns are along the Denver-Boulder Turnpike. A body -- which was ""not intact,"" according to police -- was found Wednesday at a park in Arvada, a Denver suburb just five miles from Westminster. The body was identified Friday as that of Jessica. With that news, Birk acknowledged that authorities ""recognize that there is a predator at large in our community."" ""We are doing everything within our power to apprehend that individual,"" he said. Hundreds of volunteers had searched fields and streets, posted fliers and canvassed neighborhoods since news broke of the girl's disappearance. Hundreds of local, state and federal law enforcement officers have also been working the case, according to Birk. As of Friday, authorities had searched more than 500 homes and 1,000 vehicles, responded to more than 1,500 tips and ""covered thoroughly more than 800 leads,"" said Jim Yacone, special agent in charge of the FBI's Denver office. ""Open space and water searches by both law enforcement, the Westminster Fire Department and many hundreds of volunteers have been extensive, and they will continue,"" Yacone told reporters Friday.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Undeterred by the embarrassment of a failed rocket launch earlier this year, North Korea appears to be pressing ahead with the development of long-range missiles, according to an analysis of satellite images by a U.S. academic website. Drawing on commercial satellite imagery, the website 38 North suggests that the reclusive North Korean regime has carried out at least two tests of large rocket motors at the Sohae Satellite Launch Station on the country's west coast since April. That's the same site from which the nuclear-armed North launched a long-range rocket on April 13 that broke apart shortly after takeoff. Pyongyang said the rocket was supposed to put a satellite in orbit, but the launch was seen by many other countries as cover for a ballistic missile test. The most recent test of a large rocket motor at Sohae took place in mid-September, according to the analysis posted Monday by 38 North, which is run by the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. ""These tests, critical for the development of new rockets, appear to have been of liquid-fueled, first stage engines"" for the type of satellite launch vehicle that failed in April or a new long-range missile that was on show at a parade in Pyongyang this year, 38 North said. Another big rocket launch would further sour North Korea's relations with the United States and South Korea. The failed launch in April scuppered a deal for Washington to provide thousands of tons of food aid to the North's malnourished population. It also drew condemnation from the U.N. Security Council, which repeated demands for Pyongyang not to carry out similar tests in the future. The botched launch followed previous attempts in 2006 and 2009. The difference this year was North Korea's decision to invite members of the international news media inside the country during the launch period, allowing them to visit the Sohae station ahead of the launch. North Korean state-run media also reported the rocket's failure to put a satellite in orbit, something they hadn't done for the two previous launches. But the setback hasn't stopped Pyongyang from vaunting its alleged military capabilities. Last month, it said its missiles could reach the U.S. mainland, a claim questioned by some analysts. The unsuccessful satellite launches in 2006 and 2009 were both followed weeks or months later by nuclear tests. That hasn't happened so far this time, but 38 North warned Monday that it remains a possibility. ""In the aftermath of the U.S. and South Korean presidential elections, Pyongyang may embark on a new round of activities in the first half of 2013, including rocket and nuclear tests that will contribute to further development of its nuclear deterrent,"" the website said. President Barack Obama was reelected this month in the United States, and the South Korean presidential election takes place next month. South Korean officials have said they believe the North is ready to carry out a nuclear test whenever leaders in Pyongyang make ""a political decision"" to go ahead with it. The 38 North article Monday also noted construction activity on the upper gantry platform of the launch area at Sohae that would tally with future launches of long-range rockets that are much larger than the one that failed in April. The website said it had previously reported indications that North Korea was working on such a rocket. The analysis of the satellite pictures for 38 North was provided by Nick Hansen, who has specialized in image technology during a 43-year career in intelligence for the U.S. military and private sector. He pointed to the removal of fuel tanks, the appearance of exhaust stains and the apparent scorching of nearby vegetation between April and September as signs of rocket engine tests at Sohae. The South Korean defense and unification ministries declined to comment on the article from 38 North. CNN's K.J. Kwon in Seoul, South Korea, contributed to this report.","North Korea has carried out at least 2 rocket motor tests since April, website says .

"New York (CNN) -- After his state's coastline took the brunt of Superstorm Sandy, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Friday that he expects power to be almost fully restored statewide by Saturday night. ""Life will be back -- for most of New Jersey -- to normal come Sunday,"" he told reporters. More than 175,000 households in the Garden State are still in the dark, and homes with saltwater electrical damage will have to be inspected by electricians before having their power restored. ""Some of those homes have already been disconnected,"" said Chris Eck, a spokesman Jersey Central Power & Light, the state's second largest power provider. ""We can't energize the circuit until we know the system is safe."" Christie's comments came after a tour of the Jersey shore, where Superstorm Sandy ravaged homes and business. ""Much of the iconic boardwalk is buckled and much of the piers are out to sea,"" he said. ""The shore and boardwalk in Seaside Heights of my childhood no longer exists."" ""This is our Katrina,"" the governor added. Still in the dark, frustration mounts in New York neighborhood . To the north, some 20,000 households across New York City and Westchester County remained without power. Another 150,000 homes in Long Island and harder-hit areas of Queens, such as Rockaway Peninsula, were also in the dark after the double blow of Sandy and this week's nor'easter. But in an attempt to deal with persistently long gas lines, New York police started enforcing a new alternating fuel ration system on Friday. Drivers with license plates that end with a letter or an odd number could fill up Friday, while those with even numbers or zero can fill up Saturday. ""I think it will make the lines go down,"" Sue Powers of Long Island told CNN affiliate NY1. ""Waiting (in) line here for 8Â½ hours is not fun."" Meanwhile, residents in Long Island who have been without power for 11 days expressed anger at elected officials at a rally Friday, and the politicians deftly redirected the anger at the Long Island Power Authority, charged with restoring power. Local and federal officials who stood to speak before residents in Oceanside, on Long Island, were met with boos and pointed questions about whether they had any power and how comfortable they were. ""What are you doing for us?"" some in the crowd shouted. Braving the boos, Kate Murray, presiding supervisor for the town of Hempstead, suggested residents ask themselves where the utility officials are. ""LIPA is the only entity that can turn on your electricity. Where are they?"" she said. ""They won't talk to us. We call them every day; they won't give us one answer."" Murray seemed to successfully shift the residents' cries against the politicians into chants of ""Where is LIPA? Where is LIPA?"" ""LIPA has absolutely abrogated all of its duties,"" she said. ""They should be wiped off the face of the earth."" No one from the utility was present to address the anger. In a written statement, the company said it has more than 8,200 linemen and tree-trimming crews making progress. ""When possible, we will restore power to customers who have been without power for the longest time,"" the utility said in the statement. ""Your safety and well-being remain our No. 1 priority and we thank you for your continued patience during this difficult time."" U.S. Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-New York, tried to reassure residents that all their elected officials were working around the clock on their behalf. ""Everybody is suffering. We have to get through this together, and we will get through this together,"" McCarthy said. Meanwhile, the National Park Service announced the Statue of Liberty, which had been dark since Superstorm Sandy, was to be relit Friday. The National Park Foundation said the statue ""will once again shine as a beacon of hope, a bright testament to the strength and resilience of the United States and the steadfast ability of our citizens to join together and rebuild in the face of adversity."" New Jersey, where Sandy made landfall October 29, put gas rationing rules into effect last week in 12 counties. Cold brings fresh misery to Sandy victims . Christie told reporters Thursday that the nor'easter, which brought cold and snow to the area, was responsible for 167,000 new outages but praised utility workers who were trying to get the lights and heat back on. Residents got a break from the cold weather on Friday as temperatures rose into the upper 40s and lower 50s in New England, New York and New Jersey after morning temperatures that dipped into the 30s.","NEW: More than 175,000 households in the Garden State are still in the dark.

"London (CNN) -- A retired bishop and a retired priest have been arrested by British police on suspicion of sexual offences against boys and young men -- one as young as 12 -- in the 1980s and 1990s. The 80-year-old former Church of England bishop, from Somerset in south-west England, was questioned in connection with eight alleged offences before being released on medical advice. Police say the man -- the highest-ranking church official to be arrested on abuse allegations -- will be questioned again at a later date. His former colleague, a 67-year old retired priest from West Sussex, in southern England, was questioned over two alleged offences before being released on bail pending further inquiries. The pair are understood to have worked alongside each other in the Chichester Diocese, but police say the allegations are being treated separately, and that there is no suggestion that the men acted together. The latest sexual abuse scandal to hit the UK -- this one rocking the Anglican Church -- comes after two other British institutions, the BBC and the NHS, were caught up in the case of Jimmy Savile, a British TV presenter accused of assaulting vulnerable teenagers. Peter Saunders, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (NAPAC), told CNN his organization had been inundated with reports of abuse since the Savile allegations came to light: ""We've had four or five times as many calls to our support line and emails and messages... just in these last few weeks -- it is overwhelming. I think what's happening is that we are recognizing, as a country, the huge extent of the problem of child abuse."" Detective Chief Inspector Carwyn Hughes of Sussex Police, who is leading the investigation, known as Operation Dunhill, said the Church of England was co-operating fully with police. ""The force will always take seriously any allegations of historic sexual offending, and every possible step will be taken to investigate whenever appropriate,"" he said in a statement. ""Allegations of historic offences are treated just as seriously as any more recent offences."" The Right Reverend Paul Butler, Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham and Chair of the Churches National Safeguarding Committee said in a statement: ""The Church of England takes any allegations of abuse very seriously and is committed to being a safe place for all. ""We have robust procedures and policies in place, but we can never be complacent. We would like to urge any victims or those with information to feel free to come forward knowing that they will be listened to in confidence."" Butler said the CofE -- which wanted its churches to be ""places of safety and joy, righteousness and justice"" -- had offered support to those involved in Operation Dunhill. One of the alleged victims in the case told CNN he was grateful to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, for instigating the review which had led to police investigating the abuse allegations, but said he wanted the Church of England to issue an official apology. Sussex Police insists that there are ""no allegations of recent or current offending"" and that there is nothing to suggest any young people are currently at risk.","A retired bishop and a retired priest have been arrested by British police on suspicion of sexual offences .

"New York (CNN) -- In an effort to control the city's goose population and improve aviation safety, authorities slaughtered 1,676 Canada geese across New York last summer, according to a recent U.S. Department of Agriculture report. Officials from the agency's Wildlife Service eliminated 89% of the geese that reside within 7 miles of New York's two major airports after a 2009 incident in which birds flew into the engines of US Airways Flight 1549, the report said. The collision forced the pilot, Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, to make a dramatic landing in the Hudson River. The report -- released in November -- called New York's estimated 15,000 to 20,000 Canada geese ""a significant aviation safety hazard,"" describing the population as ""five times the amount that most people would find socially acceptable."" But animal rights activists cry foul. ""I fly out of the New York airports and I want to be safe just as much as the next person,"" said Stephen Zawistowski, a spokesman for The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. ""But there are a combination of nonlethal alternatives such as habitat management and reproduction control that can be implemented to prevent the need for a mass euthanasia of Canada geese."" The number of geese euthanized in 2010 was up 441 from the previous year, the report said. The birds are generally rounded up when their feathers molt, rendering them unable to fly, said USDA Wildlife Services spokeswoman Carol Bannerman. They are then transported in crates and euthanized, she said. The practice began in 2004 at New York's Riker's Island -- used as one of the city's primary prison complexes -- due to it's proximity to LaGuardia Airport.","Authorities slaughter 1,676 Canada geese across New York last summer .

"(Mental Floss) -- Because you weren't going into botany, the priesthood, or coin manufacturing, you thought you were safe to dismiss Latin as a dead language. Obviously, you didn't graduate cum laude. I think, therefore I am the famous statue ""The Thinker"" by French sculptor Auguste Rodin. Latin is about as dead as Elvis (who, by the way, made $54 million in 2004). Whether you're deciphering a cryptic state seal or trying to impress your Catholic in-laws, knowing some Latin has its advantages. But the operative word here is ""some."" The ability to translate The Aeneid probably isn't going to come in handy anytime soon, so we'll start you off with 9 phrases that have survived the hatchet men of time (in all their pretentious glory). Caveat Emptor:   (KAV-ee-OT emp-TOR): ""Let the buyer beware"" Before money-back guarantees and 20-year warranties, caveat emptor was indispensable advice for the consumer. These days, it'd be more fitting to have it tattooed on the foreheads of used-car salesmen, infomercial actors, and prostitutes. For extra credit points, remember that caveat often makes solo appearances at cocktail parties as a fancy term for a warning or caution. Oh, and just so you know, caveat lector means ""let the reader beware."" Persona Non Grata: (puhr-SOH-nah non GRAH-tah): ""An unacceptable person"" Remember your old college buddy, the one everybody called Chugger? Now picture him at a debutante ball, and you'll start to get a sense of someone with persona non grata status. The term is most commonly used in diplomatic circles to indicate that a person is unwelcome due to ideological differences or a breach of trust. Sometimes, the tag refers to a pariah, a ne'er-do-well, a killjoy, or an interloper, but it's always subjective. Michael Moore was treated as a persona non grata at the Republican National Convention. Bill O'Reilly would experience the same at Burning Man. Habeas Corpus: (HAY-bee-as KOR-pus): ""You have the body"" When you wake up in the New Orleans Parish Prison after a foggy night at Mardi Gras, remember this one. In a nutshell, habeas corpus is what separates us from savages. It's the legal principle that guarantees an inmate the right to appear before a judge in court, so it can be determined whether or not that person is being lawfully imprisoned. It's also one of the cornerstones of the American and British legal systems. Without it, tyrannical and unjust imprisonments would be possible. In situations where national security is at risk, however, habeas corpus can be suspended. Cogito Ergo Sum: (CO-gee-toe ER-go SOME): ""I think, therefore I am"" When all those spirited mental wrestling matches you have about existentialism start growing old (yeah, right!), you can always put an end to the debate with cogito ergo sum. René Descartes, the 17th-century French philosopher, coined the phrase as a means of justifying reality. According to him, nothing in life could be proven except one's thoughts. Well, so he thought, anyway. E Pluribus Unum: (EE PLUR-uh-buhs OOH-nuhm): ""Out of many, one"" Less unique than it sounds, America's original national motto, e pluribus unum, was plagiarized from an ancient recipe for salad dressing. In the 18th century, haughty intellectuals were fond of this phrase. It was the kind of thing gentlemen's magazines would use to describe their year-end editions. But the term made its first appearance in Virgil's poem ""Moretum"" to describe salad dressing. The ingredients, he wrote, would surrender their individual aesthetic when mixed with others to form one unique, homogenous, harmonious, and tasty concoction. As a slogan, it really nailed that whole cultural melting pot thing we were going for. And while it continues to appear on U.S. coins, ""In God We Trust"" came along later (officially in 1956) to share the motto spotlight. Quid Pro Quo: (kwid proh KWOH): ""You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"" Given that quid pro quo refers to a deal or trade, it's no wonder the Brits nicknamed their almighty pound the ""quid."" And if you give someone some quid, you're going to expect some quo. The phrase often lives in the courtroom, where guilt and innocence are the currency. It's the oil that lubricates our legal system. Something of a quantified value is traded for something of equal value; elements are parted and parceled off until quid pro quo is achieved. Most recently, Arizona Senator John McCain co-opted the phrase to describe campaign finance and influence pedaling because he believes that one doesn't give major milk to a campaign without expecting major cheese in return. Ad Hominem: (ad HAH-mi-nem): ""To attack the man"" In the world of public discourse, ad hominem is a means of attacking one's rhetorical opponent by questioning his or her reputation or expertise rather than sticking to the issue at hand. Translation: Politicians are really good at it. People who resort to ad hominem techniques are usually derided as having a diluted argument or lack of discipline. If pressed, they'll brandish it like a saber and refuse to get back to the heart of the matter. Who said the debate team doesn't have sex appeal? Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam: (ad-MA-yor-em DAY-ee GLOR-ee-um): ""All for the Greater Glory of God"" Ad majorem dei gloriam is often shortened to AMDG. In other words, it's the WWJD of the Jesuits, who've been drilling the mantra into their followers since (Saint) Ignatius of Loyola founded the Catholic Order in 1534. They believe all actions, big or small, should be done with AMDG in mind. Remind your Jesuit-educated buddies of this when they seem to be straying from the path. (Best used with a wink and a hint of irony.) Sui Generis:(SOO-ee JEN-er-is):  ""Of its own genus,"" or ""Unique and unable to classify"" Frank Zappa, the VW Beetle, cheese in a can, that feeling you get when the Red Sox win the World Series: Sui generis refers to something that's so new, so bizarre, or so rare that it defies categorization. Granted, labeling something ""sui generis"" is really just classifying the unclassifiable. But let's not over-think it.

"(CNN) -- Some 43.6 million Americans are expected to travel at least 50 miles from home for the Thanksgiving holiday, a slight increase over the 43.3 million people who traveled last year, according to AAA projections. While it's the fourth consecutive year of growth in the number of holiday travelers, people are still finding ways to economize during the Thanksgiving holiday travel period (Wednesday, November 21 to Sunday, November 25). Most people drive rather than fly to their holiday destinations, but even more are driving this year: Some 90% of travelers will travel by car, a 0.6 percent increase. At the same time, the number of people flying is expected to drop from 3.2 million last year to 3.14 million this year. ""When it come to making choices, carving turkey with family and friends trumps pinching pennies,"" said AAA president and CEO Robert Darbelnet, speaking at a Tuesday press conference. Higher gas prices earlier in the year may have convinced some people to travel shorter distances for the holiday, Darbelnet said. Car travelers are expected to drive an average of 588 miles this year compared to 706 miles last year. They are also spending less on travel, with median spending expected to drop 10% this year to $498. Drivers can expect a little relief at the gas pump. The national average price of gasoline will drop to between $3.25-3.40 a gallon by Thanksgiving, according to AAA estimates. Despite this year's historically high prices, the national average dropped by nearly 40 cents a gallon since early October and is likely to continue dropping through the end of the year. TSA promises to be fully staffed . Even with the slight decline in air travel projections for this Thanksgiving holiday weekend, planes are expected to be full or nearly full. That's why Transportation Security Administration head John Pistole promised Tuesday that the agency will be fully staffed to speed travelers to their destinations. ""We understand that holiday travel can be stressful and that a great trip often begins with a positive experience at the airport,"" said Pistole, speaking at a Tuesday press conference at Reagan National Airport. ""To this end, TSA will be fully staffed and prepared for the high volume of passengers this holiday season. With everyone's security at the forefront, we continue and are committed to processing passengers as safely and efficiently as possible,"" Pistole added. Pistole advised travelers to follow some basic steps to speed up the security process. Call TSA Cares with medical issues: Travelers with disabilities and medical conditions should contact the TSA Cares helpline (855-787-2227) before their travel dates to see if they need to take any extra steps or if they qualify for extra assistance to clear security. Don't wrap presents: A TSA officer may have to unwrap gifts to inspect the contents. What a drag for your kids to see what you bought them for Christmas before the actual day! Ship desserts in advance: Sometimes a pie isn't just a pie -- it's a prohibited liquid. So while cakes and pies are permitted on airplanes, your confection may require further inspection and may not necessarily be permitted to board. Remember the cupcake fiasco of 2012? Consider baking once you get to Grandma's house. Follow the 3-1-1 rule: Most liquids can be carried in bottles that hold 3 ounces or less, once placed in a quart-sized, clear, plastic, zipped bag to hold all of your small bottles. There's a limit of one bag per passenger. You may have gotten away with more bottles on your business trips, but those flights likely weren't as full as your holiday flight is going to be. That liquid rule includes snow globes: You can bring small snow globes as carry-on luggage as long as they are less than 3.4 ounces and packed in your 3-1-1 bag. If you're not sure, leave the globe at home or ship it. Otherwise, it may get seized.","More Thanksgiving travelers are driving this year than last year .
Fewer people are taking to the air to celebrate Thanksgiving this year .
People are spending less and driving shorter distances this year .

"(CNN) -- A New Jersey man is accused of killing a 6-year-old boy and seriously wounding the boy's 12-year-old sister, Jason Laughlin of the Camden County Prosecutor's Office said Monday. Osvaldo Rivera, 31, was arrested Sunday afternoon and charged with murder and attempted murder, the prosecutor's office said in a news release. Dominick Andujar was found dead with his throat slit in a home in the city of Camden, officials said. His sister suffered stab wounds and fled to a neighbor's home after the attack. She is in critical condition at Cooper Hospital in Camden. Investigators said Rivera, who lives in the area and goes by the nickname ""Popeye,"" was discovered in an apartment on the north side of the city, hiding between a mattress and a bedroom wall. He was found with blood-stained sneakers that appeared to match bloody footprints in the victims' home, the prosecutor's office said. ""Several citizens came forward and showed the courage to provide information, which helped lead to the initial apprehension,"" Camden County Prosecutor's Office Lt. Frank Falco said. Rivera told investigators he had smoked ""wet,"" a combination of marijuana and PCP, before the killing, the prosecutor's office said. This marks the second time this drug combination has been connected with the slaying of a child in Camden, the office said. Chevonne Thomas is believed to have been smoking wet prior to allegedly beheading her son, Zahree, on August 22.. Rivera is being held at the Camden County Jail, the prosecutor's office said, and an arraignment is expected Tuesday. Attempts to contact an attorney for comment were unsuccessful Monday. Laughlin, of the prosecutor's office, said it appeared Rivera did not yet have an attorney.","A 6-year-old boy is dead and his 12-year-old sister is seriously injured .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Hu Jintao is stepping down this week as the Communist Party's general secretary -- the primus inter pares in the party politburo, China's elite decision-making body. In March next year, he is also expected to hand over his post as China's state president to his presumptive successor, Xi Jinping. But is the 69-year-old Hu retiring completely? Will he give up all his posts, including chairmanship of the Central Military Commission (CMC), an influential post that oversees major national security and military affairs? ""We don't know if he will step down yet,"" said Joseph Cheng, professor at City University of Hong Kong. ""The party congress is still in the bargaining process. For Xi Jinping, he needs time to consolidate his power no matter if Hu will retire or not."" The months leading up to the ongoing 18th party congress, which is held once every five years, have brought contentious back-room horse-trading among the party elite, including party chief Hu Jintao and retired leaders like former president Jiang Zemin, China analysts say. Speculation is rife as to why Hu would give up the CMC chair. Wenran Jiang, a professor at University of Alberta in Canada, sees two possible reasons. ""One is that the different forces within the party are intensely locked in negotiations over top appointments and Hu steps down in exchange for some personnel or policy arrangements that Hu wants. Another is possibly a new consensus that the institutional handover of leadership will be straightforward... This could be either initiated by Hu or by a collective decision."" Women breaking China's glass ceiling? The factional bargaining will culminate on Wednesday, when the party congress closes with the election of a new Central Committee, a top body of more than 200 party leaders and cadres. The next day, the committee will meet to name a new politburo and its new standing committee -- China's elite ruling council. It will also choose the new members of the Central Disciplinary Inspection Commission, an internal anti-corruption body, and the Central Military Commission (CMC). In theory, the congress delegates and the Central Committee members have some influence over -- and formally vote on --leadership decisions. However, the lineup is largely decided among the most powerful party leaders and elders. Why is CMC chairmanship important? It is the highest decision-making body in military affairs and is usually chaired by the Communist Party chief. Its members include the defense minister and top military commanders. The chair of the CMC is one of the most powerful leaders in Chinese politics, along with the Communist Party chief and State President. Hu warns party of 'enemy within' In the recent past, all three posts have been held by one person. But Hu will not be an exception if he decides to cling on to the CMC post after retirement. Deng Xiaoping kept his CMC chair and used it to exercise considerable power and influence even after he retired. Deng's successor Jiang Zemin also retained his CMC chair after he handed over top posts to Hu Jintao in 2002. However, Jiang gave it up to Hu in 2004, apparently due to pressure from party stalwarts and military leaders. Only then was Hu able to solidify his position as paramount leader. Like Deng and Jiang, analysts say, Hu would want to avoid getting relegated into a lame duck position after retirement. At stake for Hu is the chance to perpetuate his influence in the leading party bodies and policy-making institutions. It will be a sign of Hu's continued political clout if he stays, but analysts say Hu can also ensure that by proxy. ""Even if he retires, he will not retire completely,"" said Joseph Cheng. ""He wants to maintain continuity of his influence in the party and in the military."" How China's party congress works . Cheng noted that Fan Changlong, a regional commander of the People's Liberation Army, and Xu Qiliang, commander of the Chinese Air Force -- both recently appointed to the CMC -- are close to Hu. Hu has marshaled much of his political capital to promote his top protÃ©gÃ©, Li Keqiang, already in the party's inner circle and executive vice premier, as potential successor. Whether Hu can install Li ahead of Xi Jinping, who is regarded as Jiang Zemin's choice, is deemed a measure of Hu's strength. Li is expected to move to the top, but not as Hu's successor as paramount leader. Xi, 59, was elected last week as the ad hoc secretary general of the congress proceedings, another signal that he is firmly lined up to inherit Hu's top posts. The only question that remains, experts say, is when Xi will take up the CMC chairmanship. ""Xi's position will be enhanced if Hu steps down now,"" said Wenran Jiang. ""He can assume full institutional power. Of course, that will not change the basic dynamics that Xi is a team leader in a collective decision-making system. He will have to build consensus for any major policy initiatives."" Such a consensus will be even more important if Xi intends to pursue significant political reform measures.","Hu Jintao preparing to hand over power to presumptive successor, Xi Jinping .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- Over the last decade, Steven Soderbergh has taken the ""one for them, one for me"" concept of film-director politics to an almost comically programmatic extreme. Benicio Del Toro plays Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara in Steven Soderbergh's biopic. Basically, he makes big-budget crowd-pleasers like the ""Ocean's"" films, stuffed with movie stars and candied gimcrack fun, and between them he makes whatever oddball labor-of-love doodle (the enticing ""Bubble,"" the dreadful ""Solaris"") enters his head. What's disorienting about ""Che,"" his two-part, four-hour-and-17-minute, studiously eccentric drama about the revolutionary life and times of Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, is that it's almost a knowing brainteaser on Soderbergh's part to force you to figure out which category the film belongs to. Che cost a reported $65 million to make, it's full of exacting panoramas of strategy and combat set in the mountainous jungles of Cuba and Bolivia, and its hero is a figure who -- 41 years after his violent death -- remains so loved, hated, and mythologized that he fits into an epic drama timed for awards season as perfectly as Gandhi or Ray Charles ever did. Following a one-week Oscar-qualifying run, ""Che"" is now rolling out to major American cities, where it is likely to draw generations of filmgoers who've either worn Che on their T-shirts or have the honest curiosity to wonder: Who was this man before he became a Warhol-worthy icon of radical chic? In ""Che,"" Soderbergh stokes that curiosity, feeds it, and frustrates it, all at the same time. He's made a film that embraces the romance of revolution only to shake it off, leaving very little in its place. The first half of ""Che"" is a genuine achievement. It picks up Guevara (Benicio Del Toro) in 1955, when he was a clean-cut Argentine physician who dreamed of uniting Latin America through armed struggle. At a dinner party in Mexico City, he meets Fidel Castro -- played, with perfect domineering gesticulations, by Demian Bichir -- and the movie follows these two into the Cuban countryside, where they assemble the nuts and bolts of a revolution. Soderbergh exhibits a tinkerer's fascination with how it all worked, embedding each scene with a docu-nugget of information. We see Che taming his asthmatic coughing fits or reading books between battles, and learn how a battalion of rebels could defeat a platoon three times its size (with surprise, daring, and Molotov cocktails). Che is by turns scholar, guidance counselor, drill sergeant, and comandante, and Del Toro makes him a warrior-saint who learns, against his will, to cultivate a gruff bruiser facade. He yearns to be a ""true revolutionary, the highest level of humanity,"" and it's no insult to the film to say that Soderbergh and Del Toro succeed in portraying Che as a kind of T-shirt in three dimensions, a Guerrilla for All Seasons. But that's when things get strange, if not monumentally perverse. At the end of Part I -- the victory of the Cuban rebels -- my appetite was whetted to learn even more about Che, in particular how his humane ideals were tested, and compromised, by the Castro regime as it edged toward dictatorship. Instead, Part II leaps forward to 1966-67, when Che led the revolutionary war in Bolivia, and here's the thing: It turns out to be the same damn movie. Only in this dispirited rerun, the revolution doesn't take. The rebels, all squabbling ego, can barely summon the will to sacrifice and die, and the peasants have little belief that this ragtag crew is bringing a better world. Even with the U.S. poking its nose into the region, the Soviet Union won't back an insurrection. Soderbergh has built ""Che"" conceptually, as two giant panels of war, and his message is about the doomed destiny of Marxism. Che, like Marx, believed that the rise of the proletariat was inevitable -- the unstoppable tide of history -- but as the movie reveals, he was wrong. Che didn't ride a wave of history; instead, it crashed down on him. By remaining the same, he becomes, in Part II, a distant and deluded figure whose dream evaporates around him. As political theater, ""Che"" moves from faith to impotence, which is certainly a valid reading of Communism in the 20th century. Yet as drama, that makes the second half of the film borderline deadly. Che doesn't grow richer, deeper, or reveal any contradictions; he just gets more abstract -- a symbol of idealism too pure for this world. Che is twice as long as it needs to be, but it is also only half the movie it should have been. EW Grades: Part I: B+, Part II: C . CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly .

"(Financial Times) -- Eurozone finance ministers last night postponed agreement on Greece's long-delayed €31.3bn aid payment for yet another week as divisions between the International Monetary Fund and EU creditors over how fast Athens must reduce its burgeoning debt levels burst into the open. Christine Lagarde, the IMF chief, and Jean-Claude Juncker, chair of the eurogroup of finance ministers, publicly sparred over whether Greece must reduce its debt levels to 120 per cent of economic output by 2020, long viewed the target to get Athens back to a sustainable debt level. An agreement between the IMF and eurozone governments is essential to releasing the bailout tranche since both creditors disburse financial assistance concurrently. In a rare breach, Mr Juncker told a post-meeting press conference the target would be moved to 2022, prompting Ms Lagarde to insist the IMF was sticking to the original timeline. When Mr Juncker again insisted it would be moved -- ""I'm not joking,"" he said -- Ms Lagarde appeared exasperated, rolling her eyes and shaking her head. ""In our view, the appropriate timetable is 120 per cent by 2020,"" Ms Lagarde said. ""We clearly have different views."" Officials will meet again November 20 in an effort to reach agreement, Mr Juncker said. Despite the delay, officials insisted Greece would not default on Thursday, when Athens must make a debt payment of about €5bn without the benefit of international aid. Greece's ability to raise the money on its own has been cast into doubt after the European Central Bank refused to increase the amount of treasury bills it would accept as collateral from Greek banks seeking low-interest ECB loans. Without the ability to use treasury bills as collateral, Greek banks have little financial incentive to purchase them. But Olli Rehn, the EU's top economic official, said even if the ECB did not raise the ceiling of treasury bills it would accept, Greek banks had improved their cash position enough that they were expected to purchase the debt anyway, getting over what Mr Rehn termed a ""Greek fiscal cliff"". The Lagarde-Juncker spat was a public manifestation of a fight that has been simmering behind closed doors for months. The IMF has insisted the overhauled bailout plan include a credible debt reduction proposal, which may force eurozone countries to accept losses on bailout loans. But European Commission officials believe the IMF is being overly pessimistic, arguing Greece can grow faster economically and should be given more leeway to meet debt targets. According to senior officials, the IMF believes that without any relief, Greek debt will stand at nearly 150 per cent of gross domestic product by 2020, while the European Commission believes it will be just over 140 per cent. Without agreement on the baseline, officials cannot come up with a debt relief plan, which will involve both eurozone governments and the ECB giving up cash they had originally been owed by Greece. If the target is moved to 2022, eurozone governments will have an easier time formulating a plan, since it likely will only involve cutting interest rates on bailout loans. Standing firm to 2020 may require write downs on those loans, something Germany and other creditor countries have refused to do. ""We started to discuss a certain number of avenues,"" Mr Juncker said. ""My personal feeling is that [official write downs] will not be the one that will be privileged."" © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","Eurozone finance ministers postponed agreement on Greece's long-delayed €31.3bn aid payment .

"San Juan, Puerto Rico (CNN) -- A wake for a 7-year-old girl abducted and killed near her north Georgia home will be held in Puerto Rico on Monday, her family said. Friends and loved ones will honor Jorelys Rivera at a day-long wake in the family's hometown of Penuelas. She will be buried Tuesday, said her father, Ricardo Galarza. The girl's mother, Joseline Rivera, arrived in Puerto Rico Sunday on the same airplane that carried her daughter's remains, CNN affiliate WAPA reported. She said she was trying to stay strong for her other two daughters. ""I tell them, she was a princess and she is with God the father now, who is going to take care of her,"" Rivera told WAPA. Joseline Rivera wore a T-shirt with Jorelys' picture as she walked through the airport, cradling her 1-year-old daughter in one arm and holding her 4-year-old daughter's hand. Galarza said Sunday that he was ""relieved"" that Jorelys' remains had arrived in Puerto Rico. He told CNN last week that he last saw his daughter two years ago when she visited for the summer. She was supposed to have returned for Christmas. Jorelys disappeared December 2 near a playground at a Canton, Georgia, apartment complex. Searchers found her body in a compactor-type trash bin there three days later. Authorities have accused 20-year-old Ryan Brunn -- a maintenance worker at the complex -- of killing her. Jorelys died of blunt force trauma to the head and was stabbed and sexually assaulted, according to authorities. A date for Brunn's arraignment has not been set. David Cannon Sr., one of Brunn's court-appointed attorneys, has said that his client will plead not guilty. On Sunday, Rivera told WAPA that if authorities have evidence showing Brunn killed her daughter, he should face the death penalty. ""The truth is I can't tell you if it was him or if it wasn't him, because I had never seen him before,"" she said.","NEW: Jorelys Rivera's mother says she is trying to stay strong for her daughters .

"(CNN) -- It is not everywhere in the Middle East that the assassination of a security chief is accompanied by popular grief and with a funeral akin to a hero. In fact most of the revolts in the Arab Spring are against systems in which oppression is mainly conducted by such heads of security, the dreaded moukhabarat rule. The killing of Brigadier General Wissam al-Hassan in a car bomb in Beirut last week is the latest of a series of assassinations and explosions that have become associated with that city. Brig. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan a pivotal, 'polarizing' figure . One such explosion was the Marine Barracks bombing of the October 23, 1983, which caused the death of 241 U.S. soldiers, an anniversary that was not mentioned in the U.S. presidential foreign policy debate. However, the link between this attack and U.S. engagement with the Assad regime -- both the father Hafez, and then the son Bashar -- would have been useful in evaluating the impact of U.S. policies on Lebanon and on the region. Following the Marine bombing the U.S. ""redeployed"" its troops from Lebanon and there followed a series of hostage-taking of American and European citizens. The hostages were taken by Syrian/Iranian proxies in Lebanon and were later released in Damascus with the Reagan administration reluctantly having to thank Hafez Assad and re-engage with Syria if only to coordinate the repatriation of the hostages. This soon became a habit, with a gradual acknowledgement of Syria's role in resolving Lebanese problems -- albeit problems that Syria had a hand in creating in the first place. This engagement culminated in Assad being given a free hand in Lebanon as part of the incentives for Syria joining the Gulf War coalition to oust Saddam Hussein from Kuwait in 1990. The lesson was that U.S. protection is whimsical -- in order to protect the sovereignty of one small country, Kuwait, from its ambitious neighbor, another small country, Lebanon, was sold down the river to an equally ambitious neighbor, Syria. On the U.S. side, the conclusion was the opposite - the belief that Pax Syriana brings peace and stability to Lebanon. This stability lasted for about 15 years during which the Syrian moukhabarat penetrated every institution and organization in the country. This included the army, security services, parliament, ministries and even political parties and the religious establishment. Another turn in U.S.-Syrian relations was in 2004 when U.S. President George. W. Bush and French counterpart Jacques Chirac patched up their differences over Iraq by sponsoring U.N. Security Council resolution 1559 calling for Syria to withdraw from Lebanon and to stop interfering in the affairs of the country. The deal was off, Syria withdrew its army but there was a return of instability, wars and assassinations in Lebanon till the summer of 2008 when the west re-engaged. The Doha agreement in May 2008, accompanied by Western re-engagement with Syria, came after Syria's allies had withdrawn from government, blocked parliament, occupied the city center of Beirut for 18 months and a Hezbollah-led attack on the city in May. All of this came while anti-Syrian politicians and journalists were being assassinated. The agreement restored Syrian influence in the country, again with Western blessing, this time under the guise of a National Unity Government. Assassinations stopped, stability returned, and eventually a fully pro-Syrian government was formed, almost coup like, where some Hariri allies were coerced to switching side or the country would face renewed chaos. Again the West engaged Syria to bring back stability to Lebanon. The pattern emerges where Lebanon is like a hostage, and the West the subject of extortion. The success of this model of Western relations with Syria encouraged the Assad regime to replicate it throughout the region. Thus agreements between the Palestinians from Hamas and Fatah were blocked, and Assad promised to facilitate them; al Qaeda-type terrorists were infiltrating Iraq from Syria, and Assad promised to control that border; the PKK created problems for Turkey and Assad promised to suppress it in Syria. This was all in the same way that Hezbollah was armed through Syria and Assad promised to control it too. The 2011 revolt against Bashar al-Assad in Syria came as a total surprise to a U.S. administration still enjoying their honeymoon with him. Key administration officials repeatedly visited Damascus and believed in al-Assad's promises of stability in the region and peace with Israel, thus vindicating their own policy of engagement and dialogue instead of that of isolation, intervention and regime change associated with the Bush period. Wissam al-Hassan was appointed in 2005 as head of one of the new Lebanese security branches, free from Syrian infestation, that were set up after the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafic Hariri. He was at the forefront of the international investigation that preceded the setting up of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) and his unit collaborated with over 30 international teams and trained in the most advanced forensic techniques. Other members of his team were also the targets of assassination. The unit is said to have foiled over 35 assassination plots, disrupted terrorist networks and uncovered spy rings. Al-Hassan's latest exploit may have been a step too far. Whether true or not, many in Lebanon immediately suspected al-Assad's regime in the assassination. If they did kill the man who was in charge of protecting the country, the message to Lebanon and the West is clearly that the Assad regime can still do a lot of damage to the region unless it is left alone to finish the job of suppressing the revolution. Lebanese and Syrians, who watched the presidential foreign policy debate with great anxiety, are worried about whether al-Assad's blackmail still works, and would have found little comfort in the lack of will of both candidates to take any decisive moves against the Syrian regime. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nadim Shehadi.","Nadim Shehadi says the Beirut attack would be a useful moment to evaluate U.S. regional policy .

"New York (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Thursday designated Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan as the federal point person to lead the recovery effort from Superstorm Sandy, a little over two weeks after the rare mix of converging weather slammed into the Northeast. ""We thought it'd be good to have a New Yorker,"" Obama said, referencing Donovan's previous stint atop the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development. The agency is thought to be among the nation's largest municipal developers of low- to mid-income housing. ""FEMA basically runs the recovery process,"" the president said. ""It doesn't focus on the rebuilding. For that, we've got to have all government agencies involved."" He addressed reporters beside Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Michael Bloomberg in hard-hit Staten Island, where more than half of New York City's 43 storm deaths occurred. Obama also toured Rockaway Peninsula, where a tidal surge and heavy winds lashed homes and businesses and rendered much of the region without power. ""We are going to be here until the rebuilding is complete,"" he said. ""I'm also going to be coming back in the future to make sure that we have followed through on that commitment."" Map: See images of destruction, recovery across the East Coast . As of Thursday evening, about 4,000 households remained without power across New York, officials said. It was not clear if that number included thousands of customers the Long Island Power Authority previously reported as ""unable to safely receive power without customer repairs."" About 1,400 customers were without power in New Jersey, officials there said. On October 31, Obama broke from his re-election campaign to meet with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and assess the widespread damage near Atlantic City, two days after Superstorm Sandy barreled through. On Wednesday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said the federal government's typical approach to disaster relief, such as the widespread use of emergency trailers for displaced residents and long-term rental assistance, doesn't work as well in New York, where space is limited. ""New York is a unique housing environment,"" said Michael Byrne, federal coordinating officer for FEMA. ""We had to come up with something."" He said FEMA will work to make short-term repairs to homes to make them habitable. More complete repairs will come later, Byrne said. Rental housing vacancies across New York City are less than 5%, while holiday season hotel rooms are packed with tourists and travelers, leaving few options for those in need of shelter, authorities said, so getting those hit by the storm back into their own homes became a priority. Meanwhile, concerns over basic supplies and gas shortages have started to diminish, though New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said Thursday that his office had initiated the beginnings of ""a wide-ranging investigation"" over price gouging ""after receiving hundreds of complaints from consumers across the state of New York."" Long Island's odd/even gas rationing program will end at midnight Friday, said Nassau and Suffolk County Executives. The program was put into effect November 9. On Sunday, Vice President Joe Biden is expected to tour areas of New Jersey hard hit by Superstorm Sandy, the White House said.

"(CNN) -- Chelsea and England defender Ashley Cole ensured the continuation of one of the most rancorous sagas in the history of the English game when labeling the country's Football Association (FA) a ""bunch of twats"" on Friday. The 31-year-old took to Twitter to refute the findings of an FA disciplinary panel which cast ""considerable doubt"" over evidence he gave in defense of former England captain John Terry, who was found guilty last month of racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand. Ferdinand is the brother of Manchester United star Rio Ferdinand, whose comments about former England colleague Cole and strained relations with onetime defensive partner Terry have contributed to what one leading football official has described as a ""'mafia feud"". 'Hahahahaa, well done #fa I lied did I, #BUNCHOFTWATS,' Cole tweeted, so courting a possible misconduct charge himself from the very organization he was criticizing. Cole, who is set to join up with the England squad after the weekend for two forthcoming World Cup qualifiers, has since deleted the tweet that was re-tweeted over 19,000 times and apologized for his remarks. ""I had just finished training and saw the captions on the TV screens in the treatment rooms about what was said in the FA Commission ruling about me,"" a statement issued by the player declared. ""I was really upset and tweeted my feelings in the heat of the moment. I apologize unreservedly for my comment about the FA."" Cole was responding to the FA's publication on Friday of a 63-page report which questioned the truth of statements given by himself, Terry and Chelsea club secretary David Barnard about a Premier League game at QPR in October 2011 -- with the commission describing Terry's defense as ""improbable, implausible and contrived."" Stripped of the England captaincy in February by the FA in relation to an incident which has since seen him retire from international football, Terry has until 18 October to decide whether to appeal his four-game suspension and US$350,000 fine. During a game which Chelsea lost 1-0, following the dismissal of two players from the current European champions, Terry has admitted to calling Ferdinand a ""f****** black c***"" in the closing moments. The defense for his comments was based on the claim he was repeating words Ferdinand had said to him, with the Chelsea captain saying he was asking his fellow defender if he believed he had been on the end of racial abuse. ""We are driven to conclude not just that it is 'highly unlikely' that Mr. Ferdinand accused Mr. Terry on the pitch of calling him a 'black c***', but that he did not,"" the FA commission wrote. ""A much more plausible and likely explanation is that Mr. Terry was angry; angry at Mr. Ferdinand's taunting and provocation of him, angry at the way the match had gone, and angry at the way in which it seemed likely to end. ""The much more likely explanation for what he said is that all of this provoked him into saying 'f***ing black c***' as an insult, which is consistent with the fact that insults preceded and followed those words. ""The Commission is entitled to use its collective experience of life and people to judge demeanor. ""We have watched the film footage many times. In the critical phase, during which he uses the words 'f***ing black c***', Mr. Terry can be seen to be smiling initially, before his facial expression changes to disdainful and contemptuous. ""At no point is his demeanor and facial expression that of someone who is imploring, injured, or even quizzical in the face of an unfounded allegation by Mr. Ferdinand that he (Mr. Terry) had just been racially abusive towards him (Mr. Ferdinand)."" Terry was cleared in a magistrates' court in July of racially abusing Ferdinand but the FA found him guilty on 27 September, using the ""balance of probabilities"" as its standard of proof as opposed to the ""beyond reasonable doubt"" ruling used in a criminal trial. The organization stressed that it does not believe ""Terry to be a racist"", citing a large body of testimonial evidence -- ""including statements from black footballers"" -- to say that he is not, but that it did find the controversy-plagued 31-year-old guilty of making a racist insult. The FA also stated that it had ""considerable doubt"" over Cole's claims that he had heard Ferdinand use the word ""black"" when insulting Terry after the pair clashed late on. The initial evidence given by Cole in the days after the game was amended in November 2011 when Chelsea secretary Barnard asked the FA to add the word ""black"" to the left back's original statement. Nearly one year on, the FA panel found Barnard's evidence to be ""materially defective."" It went on: ""The Commission [has] considerable doubt as to whether the request to amend paragraph 4 of Mr. Cole's statement, to include the word 'black', was based on Mr. Cole's own personal recollections, or as a result of discussions that he had had with Mr. Barnard."" The document also found fault with Cole's claims since it believes abusive comments made by Ferdinand himself towards Terry -- which the QPR defender says were in relation to a perceived marital affair by the Chelsea man with a former team mate's ex-girlfriend -- were of a sexual rather than racial nature. Some observers have queried the leniency of Terry's ban, half that given to Liverpool's Luis Suarez after he repeatedly racially abused Manchester United's Patrice Evra last year, and the FA report states that the Chelsea captain's punishment took light of the fact that his ""racist insult was issued only once"". Even should Terry decide against appealing his ban and fine, Cole's outburst will means that an ongoing stain on the English game --- namely, the continuing focus on racism in the self-proclaimed ""best league in the world"" --- looks set to continue for some time.","England international Ashley Cole apologizes after calling Football Association a 'bunch of twats'

"(EW.com) -- With so many talk show hosts elbowing for our late night TV viewing attention — Jay and Dave and Jimmy and Jimmy and Craig and Conan and Jon and Stephen and Chelsea and Carson — it's hard to remember that there was a time when there was just Johnny. For 30 years on The Tonight Show, Johnny Carson dominated the late night landscape along with his stalwart sidekick Ed McMahon, putting the nation to bed with a formula of monologue, celebrity interview, occasional skit, and musical guest that remains more-or-less intact to this day. But while Johnny was a fixture of American culture, part of his legend is that he remained essentially a mystery — an intensely private man who granted few interviews and all but disappeared from public view from when he retired in 1992 to when he died in 2005. That may soon change. Deadline is reporting that a biopic about Carson is currently in the works, with screenwriter John McLaughlin (""Black Swan,"" this month's ""Hitchcock"") adapting journalist Bill Zehme's forthcoming biography ""Carson the Magnificent: An Intimate Portrait."" There is no studio or director yet attached to the project — and since the book has yet to be released, everything remains in the embryonic stages. But with a subject who looms so large in American pop culture, all producer Tom Thayer (""Hitchcock"") would likely need to do is hook an A-list star to play Carson — and perhaps another A-lister as McMahon — and he could be well on his way to a greenlight. So who could play Carson and McMahon? We held several envelopes to our heads and came up with a list of prospective actors, some more obvious than others. Check out our list below: . JOHNNY CARSON . EW Daily Poll: Which is the best Pixar movie? Kevin Spacey: It's actually kinda unfair to start with Spacey, because anyone who saw his Carson imitation on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon knows the Oscar-winner has the guy nailed. Watch it here, and marvel. Basically, this role is Spacey's to lose. Robert Downey Jr.: Crack comic timing and a wry deadpan delivery? Check. Plus, it would be really nice to see Downey in a film where the biggest fight scenes involve Zsa Zsa Gabor. Jim Carrey: He understands the power of Carson better than most: He bombed in very first appearance on American television doing a meta Elvis Presley impression on The Tonight Show. Plus, Carrey's performance as Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon has already proven he can bridge the gap between an imitation and a lived-in performance. Bill Hader: There may not be a better impressionist working today, and the ""SNL"" MVP is long overdue for a breakout feature film role. ED McMAHON . Will Ferrell: Especially if producers go with a non-comedian for the Carson role, Ferrell could bring some welcome comedy chops to the production. Josh Brolin: As George W. Bush in Oliver Stone's W., Brolin showed he is a crackerjack mimic — and his SNL hosting gig earlier this year proved he's no slouch at comedy either. Jeffrey Tambor: He knows this role better than most, having played hapless sidekick Hank Kingsley on HBO's brilliant late night send-up ""The Larry Sanders Show."" Plus, his baritone would be perfect saying ""Herrrrre's Johnny!"" Bill Hader: He's such a versatile impressionist, Hader could play both Carson and McMahon. See the original article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Just as President Barack Obama secured his re-election, a scandal jolted his national security team. The resignation of retired four-star general David Petraeus as CIA director over an extramarital affair followed by the investigation of the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John Allen, in relation to e-mail exchanges with a woman caught up in the Petraeus mess is just one of many dramas to unfold following a presidential re-election. Is Petraeus pillow talk a security threat? Here, we take a look at big scandals and controversies that plagued other presidents after voters re-elected them to the White House: . George W. Bush | HURRICANE KATRINA, 2005 . President George W. Bush won re-election in 2004, defeating Democrat Sen. John Kerry. The Republican was a wartime president after the 9/11 attacks and managed to secure a second term as commander-in-chief. Eight months after Bush's second inauguration, Hurricane Katrina destroyed parts of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, killing more than 1,800 people. The Category Three storm made landfall on August 29, 2005, displacing hundreds of thousands of people and causing $108 billion in damage. Bush was asked to declare a federal state of emergency for the city before the storm hit but delayed acting for days, leaving many without any aid. A congressional report released in 2006 called the government response to the storm a ""failure of leadership"" that left people stranded when they were most in need. Bush left office at the end of his second term in 2009. Bill Clinton | MONICA LEWINSKY, 1998 . ""I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky,"" President Bill Clinton said with his wife, Hillary, standing by his side at a White House news conference. It was January 26, 1998, and several days earlier, news organizations began reporting the alleged affair between Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, a young White House intern. Clinton eventually acknowledged a sexual relationship with Lewinsky and became only the second president to be impeached by the U.S. House, which alleged perjury and obstruction of justice following a lengthy investigation by an independent counsel. However, the Senate acquitted him in 1999, and Clinton left office at the end of his second term two years later. Ronald Reagan | IRAN-CONTRA AFFAIR, 1986 . President Ronald Reagan did not blink at fighting communism in Grenada and in Central America, but funding of anti-communist rebels in Nicaragua would lead to the worst scandal of his administration. The secret and rogue operation under the direction of the National Security Council's Oliver North used the proceeds from weapons sales to Iran to fund the Nicaraguan Contras -- despite a congressional ban on such funding. Ronald Reagan appeared on TV stating there were no ""arms for hostages"" deal but later admitted that there had been. Richard Nixon | WATERGATE, 1972 . The Watergate break-in triggered the slow unraveling of Richard Nixon's presidency. On the night of June 17, 1972, operatives of Nixon's re-election campaign broke into offices at the Watergate Hotel complex in Washington -- headquarters of the Democratic National Committee. Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein uncovered a scandalous trail that led to the Oval Office and Nixon's resignation in 1974.

"London (CNN) -- Tabloid The Sun on Friday became the first mainstream British newspaper to publish photographs of a vacationing Prince Harry in the nude. The pictures of the prince, showing him naked in a hotel suite while he was on vacation last week in Las Vegas, were widely available on the Internet after website TMZ published them Tuesday. But British newspapers initially declined to publish them. The Sun's front page, headlined ""Heir it is!"" -- a play on Harry's status as third in line to the throne -- shows the 27-year-old prince naked except for a watch and necklace, protecting his modesty with his cupped hands. A second image widely circulated online, which shows Harry hugging a woman from behind next to a pool table, both of them naked, is also printed in the paper, with a large crown superimposed across his bottom. Ryan Lochte: Glad he missed Prince Harry's after party . The newspaper defends its decision to go ahead with publishing the image as being in the interests of a free press. ""The Sun is NOT making any moral judgement about Harry's nude frolics with girls in a Las Vegas hotel. Far from it. He often sails close to the wind for a Royal - but he's 27, single and a soldier. We like him,"" the story reads. ""We are publishing the photos because we think Sun readers have a right to see them."" There is ""a clear public interest"" in making the image available to everyone, regardless of whether they have internet access, so they can join the debate on his behavior, the newspaper argues. The tabloid is Britain's biggest daily paper in terms of circulation. A spokeswoman for the Press Complaints Commission, the UK press watchdog, said that it had not yet received a complaint from the Palace in regards to The Sun's publication of the photographs. Royal officials had urged the UK media not to breach the prince's privacy by publishing the pictures. A spokeswoman for St. James' Palace said editors are at liberty to make their own decisions. ""We have made our views on Prince Harry's privacy known. Newspaper regulate themselves, so the publication of the photographs is ultimately a decision for editors to make,"" the palace said. ""We have no further comment to make, either on the publication of the photos or on the story itself, concerning Prince Harry's private holiday in Las Vegas."" David Dinsmore, managing editor of The Sun, said Thursday that his group ""thought long and hard about this,"" but ultimately decided to publish the images because news consumers could access them elsewhere. A tale of two brothers: Harry vs. William . ""This is about the ludicrous situation where a picture can be seen by hundreds of millions of people around the world on the Internet, but can't be seen in the nation's favorite paper read by 8 million people every day,"" he said. Dinsmore also said that The Sun is ""a responsible paper and it works closely with the royal family"" and that ""we take heed of their wishes."" ""We're also big fans of Prince Harry. He does a huge amount of work for this country and for the military and for the image of both of those institutions,"" Dinsmore said. ""We are not against him letting his hair down once in a while. For us, this is about the freedom of the press."" Sky News' managing editor, Peter Lowe, wrote in a blog post Thursday that the satellite broadcaster, which is also part of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. empire, did not intend to publish because it accepts that Harry ""has a reasonable expectation of privacy"" while in a hotel room on vacation. ""Clearly millions of people want to see what the third-in-line to the throne looks like in his birthday suit, judging by the clicks on the websites that are showing them,"" he writes. ""But just because people have a voyeuristic interest in looking at the pictures, it doesn't mean Sky News needs to show them either online or on TV. ""They serve no purpose for our audience and seeing the precise contours of the royal body exposed in all their glory is not in the public interest, even if the public is interested."" The BBC, Britain's publicly-funded broadcaster, also said it did not plan to publish the grainy images -- and it broadcast footage of The Sun's front page with the photo of the naked prince backed out. ""We decided at the very start that there was no public interest in showing the pictures,"" a spokesman said. The hesitation to publish such photos, even those of royals, is somewhat new to British papers. Prince Charles, Prince Andrew and the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, have all been caught up in tabloid scandals -- with or without embarrassing photos to accompany them. But things changed in the past 18 months, with the discovery of the full scale of a media phone-hacking scandal. This forced the closure of the News of the World tabloid and prompted an inquiry into British press standards, led by Lord Justice Leveson. Naked Harry scandal a watershed moment for UK press . After months of evidence, Lord Leveson is deciding whether to recommend new rules governing the conduct of the UK media. Until his report is ready, analysts have said, editors don't want to take too many chances. In a blog for the Huffington Post this week, Neil Wallis, former deputy editor of The Sun and the now-defunct News of the World, said the dilemma over whether to use the Prince Harry photographs was ""nothing to do with journalistic merit, nothing to do with the merits of the story, nothing to do with legal issues, nothing even to do with journalistic ethics... ""The decisions are being reached on the basis of: 'What will Lord Leveson think?' And that is shocking, it is outrageous, it is a disgraceful affront to free speech."" Some commentators also have suggested that part of the reason for the British media's hesitation is the fact that, in the wake of a series of good news stories including Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee, the royals' stock is higher now than it has been in decades. Writing in the New Statesman, Steven Baxter claimed the papers were refusing to use the pictures not out of ""fear of regulators but fear of their own readers,"" adding that Prince Harry and his kin ""are celebrities, like others, but untouchable ones."" Pending any changes in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry, British newspaper editors are bound by the Press Complaints Commission's Code of Practice, which says that ""everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private and family life,"" and that ""it is unacceptable to photograph individuals in private places without their consent."" There are exceptions for cases ""in the public interest."" Reacting to the Sun's decision Thursday, Mark Stephens, a British media lawyer, said he wasn't convinced the Prince Harry pictures rose to that level. ""Sun to publish Prince Harry pics. So what's the public interest? Or is it just a blatant publicity stunt?"" Stephens posted to Twitter. Former British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, referring to The Sun's owner Rupert Murdoch, tweeted Thursday that ""tonight's decision by @rupertmurdoch to allow The Sun to print the private Harry photos shows his contempt for the PCC, Leveson & the law.""

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of prisoners in Myanmar have been granted their freedom, according to the state-run newspaper, just days before President Barack Obama is scheduled to become the first sitting U.S. head of state to visit the fledgling democracy. Myanmar's President Thein Sein bestowed amnesty Thursday on 452 prisoners, both Myanmar citizens and foreigners, with plans to extradite the foreigners, The New Light of Myanmar reported.

The paper said Sein mandated the releases, in accord with the nation's constitution and criminal code, ""on humanitarian grounds, for turning them into citizens who do their bits in nation-building tasks, realizing sympathy and good will of the state and for prolonging friendship with neighboring countries."" Under Sein, the Myanmar government has released hundreds of political prisoners in the past year, part of a series of reforms that has followed decades of repressive military rule. Western governments have responded to the efforts by starting to ease sanctions put in place to pressure the military regime in the country formerly known as Burma.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- China's top security official paid a surprise visit to Afghanistan, where he met with President Hamid Karzai on issues ranging from investment and bilateral trade to to terrorism and drug trafficking, China's state-run news agency said Sunday. The visit Saturday by Zhou Yongkang, a member of Communist Party's politburo, the elite group of 25 men who run China, was the first visit by a top Chinese official since 1955, Xinhua reported. Beijing kept the visit secret because of security concerns, the agency said. ""It is the consistent policy of the Chinese government and the (party) to consolidate and develop China-Afghanistan relations,"" Zhou said in a statement reported by Xinhua. Zhou also said China is willing to make ""due contributions"" to peace and stability.

"Paris (CNN) -- French Prime Minister Francois Fillon insisted Saturday that France is a safe bet for investors, a day after the country's credit rating was downgraded by a ratings agency amid concerns over debt and low growth. France was among nine euro area countries to be downgraded by Standard & Poor's Friday, losing its AAA rating in the process. Austria also had its top-tier credit rating lowered by one notch to AA+. Speaking in Paris, Fillon sought to reassure the international markets. ""France is a safe country, a country which investors can trust and have confidence in. The rating agencies are useful barometers, but they are not the ones who make France's policies,"" he said. ""France's rating remains one of the highest in the world."" He also cautioned against politicians making too much of the downgrade -- which had been widely anticipated after S&P put 15 members of the euro currency bloc, France among them, on review last month. ""This decision constitutes a warning that must be neither dramatized nor underestimated,"" Fillon said. ""Those who dramatize the situation should think twice: these are indeed the same people who refused to vote on reforms to strengthen our competitiveness and to reduce deficits, whether that be downsizing the public sector or the pension reform."" The downgrade may be seen as bad news for the government ahead of the country's presidential election in April. President Nicolas Sarkozy of the UMP party is bidding for re-election, with Socialist Francois Hollande considered his chief rival. ""Everyone needs to remain calm and remember their responsibilities,"" Fillon said. ""The government remembers its responsibility and is pursuing the strategy agreed on with the president."" Germany, Finland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg all maintained their AAA ratings. But S&P cut the ratings of France, Austria, Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia by one notch. Italy, Spain, Portugal and Cyprus were cut by two notches. S&P warned that most governments in the single currency euro area are at risk of further downgrades given the risk of a ""more adverse economic and financial environment."" The agency said a deeper-than-expected recession in the eurozone would put further stress on government finances. In addition, governments remain vulnerable to further turmoil in the bond market, which could drive up their borrowing costs. Nonetheless, S&P said it welcomed recent moves by the European Central Bank to help prevent a credit crisis in the banking system. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Saturday that Europe still has a long road ahead to restore investor confidence. But, she said in a statement, the right steps have been taken, and measures to cut debt and remove obstacles to growth will soon lead to greater stability for euro zone nations. U.S. stocks finished in the red Friday as investors braced for the impending downgrades. The news came at the end of a week in which solid demand at debt auctions in Italy and Spain had calmed some nerves, however, and eased borrowing costs for those two governments. CNN's Per Nyberg and Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.","PM Francois Fillon: ""This warning should not be dramatized""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- George Clooney and Meryl Streep appear to be main contenders in the 2012 Hollywood award season after Sunday night's Golden Globes. But the winners of the best film drama actor honors face competition from a silent film star and an actress who brought Marilyn Monroe back to life. Clooney's ""The Descendants"" won for best drama film, while Clooney received the best actor in a drama film award. ""The Artist,"" a black and white silent movie, was chosen best comedy or musical film, while its lead Jean Dujardin won best actor in a comedy or musical movie. The movie's music also won for best original film score. The Globes set the stage for a Meryl Streep versus Michelle Williams best actress showdown at the Academy Awards in six weeks by handing both women best actress honors. Streep won the drama film best actress Globe for her portrayal of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in ""Iron Lady,"" while Williams carried home the comedy or musical film Globe for playing movie legend Marilyn Monroe in ""My Week With Marilyn."" Since the Globes separates dramas from comedies -- unlike the Academy Awards -- Williams, Streep, Clooney and Dujardin were not competing against each other in the 69th annual Golden Globes award show. ""Thank you to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for putting in my hand the same award that Marilyn Monroe herself won over 50 years ago,"" Williams said in her acceptance speech. Oscar nominations will be revealed later this month and the Academy Awards follows at the end of February. Other films expected to be Oscar contenders also got a share of the Globes spotlight. Woody Allen's ""Midnight In Paris"" lost out to ""The Artist,"" but Allen did win for best film screenplay. The 3-D family movie ""Hugo"" was also passed up, but Martin Scosese got the best director award for making the film. Who ruled the red carpet? The civil rights-era movie ""The Help"" claimed the best supporting actress award for Octavia Spencer. Spencer, who played a maid in the movie, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in her acceptance: ""All labor that uplifts humanity has dignity and importance."" Although the ""Help"" characters are fictional ""they represent scores of real people,"" she said. ""The narrative itself is part of our fabric,"" Spencer said backstage. ""It's important to keep the younger generation abreast of how far we've come, because this is really foreign to them."" Christopher Plummer won the Golden Globe for best supporting actor in a film for his role in ""Beginners."" Steven Spielberg's ""The Adventures Of Tintin"" won the Golden Globe for best animated feature film. The best foreign-language film honor was awarded to the Iranian film ""A Separation."" Pop icon Madonna took home a Golden Globe for writing the best original song in a movie. Her ""Masterpiece"" was written for ""W.E."" She offered fitness advice to reporters backstage. ""The best thing for your bum is dancing,"" the Material Girl said. Early in the broadcast, host Ricky Gervais took quick aim at the Hollywood Press Association, the group that hired him to perform hosting duties for a third year. Gervais, in his opening monologue, compared the Golden Globes to the Oscars, ""but without all that esteem."" The Globes are to the Oscars ""what Kim Kardashian is to Kate Middleton. A bit louder, a bit drunker and more easily bought,"" he joked. The group of about 85 writers invited Gervais to host the telecast again this year despite -- or because of -- the controversy stirred last year by his take-no-prisoners jokes. Unlike the Oscars, the Globes also honors television shows with 11 categories. Showtime's ""Homeland"" was the only TV show to win two Globes. It won best drama series, while Claire Danes won the best actress in a drama series award. Kelsey Grammer's Golden Globe may not be the biggest award given out Sunday night, but the actor may have been the happiest backstage where he revealed his wife is expecting twins. Grammer won for best actor in a television drama series for his role as a corrupt Chicago mayor in the Starz series ""Boss."" In the television comedy or musical series categories, ABC's ""Modern Family"" won best series, while Laura Dern won best actress for her work in HBO's ""Enlightened"" and Matt LeBlanc won best actor for Showtime's ""Episodes."" PBS's ""Downton Abbey"" won for best made-for-TV movie or mini-series. Kate Winslet won the Golden Globe for best actress in a made-for-TV movie or mini-series for her role in HBO's ""Mildred Pierce."" It was Winslet's third Globe. She won two in 2009, for ""Revolutionary Road"" and ""The Reader."" Winslet was asked backstage her opinion of reports that Lindsay Lohan was in negotiations to portray the late Elizabeth Taylor in a film. ""I'm not going to go there, dude,"" Winslet said. ""It's kind of a hot zone."" British actor Idris Elba won best actor in a made-for-TV movie or mini-series for ""Luther."" Backstage, he acknowledged that he's talked to producers about possibly becoming the next James Bond. ""Of course, I would be honored to play the part if it comes along,"" Elba said. The TV best supporting actor and actress awards went to Peter Dinklage for HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" and Jessica Lange in ""American Horror Story"" on FX, respectively. Sidney Poitier led a tribute to actor Morgan Freeman, who was presented the Golden Globe's ""Cecil B. DeMille Award."" ""You illuminate your presence, you infuse the characters you play with a real life three-dimensional aura,"" Poitier said. ""You become the character, the character becomes you. So begins a process that captivates your audience."" Freeman, speaking backstage, said it was watching Poitier as a teenager that steered his path. ""Most of us need something to guide ourselves and Sidney has been my beacon, my guiding star,"" he said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Chinese President Hu Jintao wrapped up his U.S. visit Friday with a trip to Chicago, the hometown of his counterpart, U.S. President Barack Obama. He visited a Chinese-owned auto parts firm, a Chinese wind energy company and the Confucius Institute -- a Chinese language and cultural education center housed at Walter Payton College Preparatory High School. Hu wrapped up his three-day visit to the U.S. capital Thursday, telling an audience of American business leaders that Beijing is seeking closer ties and greater trust with the United States on a range of issues. He sought to assuage concerns about China's rising economic and military power, declaring that his country ""will never seek hegemony or pursue an expansionist policy."" The Chinese leader was unapologetic, however, about Beijing's position on the politically sensitive status of Tibet and Taiwan, calling it a matter of Chinese territorial integrity and a ""core interest."" We are building ""a socialist country under the rule of law,"" he asserted. He said relations between Washington and Beijing need to be governed by a belief in ""equality"" and ""mutual respect."" Hu made his remarks at a luncheon hosted by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, the U.S.-China Business Council and other organizations. Earlier Thursday, Hu traveled to Capitol Hill, where congressional leaders used the occasion to raise strong concerns about Beijing's commitment to human rights and economic issues such as the protection of intellectual property. He met with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, among others. Neither man attended Wednesday night's White House state dinner in honor of the Chinese leader. Earlier in the week, Reid called Hu a ""dictator,"" a word that was later recanted by both the senator and his spokesman. Boehner said that concerns about tensions on the Korean peninsula also were raised during Thursday's talks. We had ""a good meeting,"" Boehner said.  ""I would hope that the dialogue on all of these subjects would continue."" Disagreements over human rights -- including China's treatment of imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo -- were ""raised very strongly,"" according to Rep. Howard Berman of California, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""I would not indicate there was great engagement ... other than a general recognition by the president of China that they have a ways to go,"" Berman told reporters. On Wednesday, Hu met with Obama behind closed doors at the White House as top officials from both countries worked to address issues tied to the global economic crisis, international security, the environment and human rights. Obama administration officials used the president's meeting with Hu to highlight economic progress between the two countries, announcing Beijing's approval of $45 billion in new contracts for U.S. companies to export goods to China. The contracts will support an estimated 235,000 American jobs, according to the White House. The two leaders acknowledged continuing differences on human rights but pledged to keep working on the matter in a ""frank and candid way,"" according to Obama. Human rights remains a touchy subject in China, as censors in the Asian nation made clear during Hu's visit by blacking out CNN's news broadcast each time the topic of human rights was mentioned. Even when Hu spoke about human rights, it was blacked out. Footage of anti-China protesters near the White House was similarly blacked out. Obama has nevertheless hailed Hu's visit as a chance to lay a foundation for the next 30 years of Sino-American relations. Hu declared the relationship between the two powers to be one of ""strategic significance and global influence."" During a news conference with reporters Wednesday, Obama said he had received a promise from Hu to establish a more ""level playing field"" for U.S. trade. China's currency, Obama said, remains undervalued -- a key factor in America's trade imbalance with Beijing. Hu conceded that key differences remain over economic policy, but he promised that Beijing would continue making attempts to resolve those differences. CNN's Alan Silverleib, Ben Rooney, Tom Cohen and Aaron Smith contributed to this report.","Chinese leader ends visit with a stop at a Chinese language and cultural center in Chicago .

"(CNN) -- Singer Solange Knowles, also known as younger sister to Beyonce, took to Twitter on Wednesday claiming that Transportation Security Administration officials in Miami had searched her hair. It didn't take long for Knowles, who called it ""Discrim-FRO-nation"" to get funny with it. ""Lets play a little game called: ""What did TSA find in Solange's Fro""?"" she wrote to her 1.3 million Twitter followers. ""Romney's actual 5 point plan,"" replied @Elle_is_haute. ""@Remzophilos: the good lord, Jesus of nazareth was fount in @solangeknowles' fro,"" wrote someone else. While she wouldn't comment on the specifics, the TSA doesn't have a policy of specifically searching Afros, said agency spokeswoman Sari Koshetz. ""Can I touch it?"" The fascination with natural, African-American hair . ""If someone is passing through the advanced imaging technology machine, it shows an outline of an individual, the same for every single person,"" said Koshetz. ""If the hair area is highlighted, the machine may have picked up an anomaly or a possible threat in the head area."" That could include a bobby pin, hair clip, extension clips, ponytail holders or cloth head wraps. ""It would not be someone's hair but something in someone's hair,"" she said. Natural hair stylist Isis Brantley, who claimed that TSA agents searched her hair last year, isn't buying it. Brantley says her hair clients often complain that security officials search their hair at the airport. ""How could you not know that people wear Afros?"" she said. But she thinks African-American women who wear their hair naturally are seen as ""flaunting it. You cannot be seen in public with this hair and not have something happen."" Knowles had fun with her fans, and then she called it quits. ""Ok. Game over:( Flights taking off. Me and my wig had a lot of good laughs with y'all.""

"(CNN) -- In Juanga, India, a village of less than 3,000 inhabitants, the adults typically work as farmers on small plots of land earning less than $2 a day. They live in extended families in two or three roomed bamboo thatched mud huts, surviving on rice and dahl. Unable to see the value of education, the parents typically take their children out of school before they turn 16 to earn money. Women frequently deny themselves trips to health clinics and they lack knowledge of basic preventative healthcare measures. They also lack basics such as drinking water, electricity, food, healthcare and infrastructure, but cell phone towers are often ubiquitous. One American non-profit organization is using this proliferation of phone masts to bring empowering mobile technology to these destitute villagers. mPowering, headquartered in San Francisco, has joined forces with Citta, a charity working in Orissa, one of the poorest states in India, which has a population of 37 million, roughly the same size as California. According to UNICEF, Orissa has the most people living below the poverty line of any state in India and one of the highest infant and maternal mortality rates of all the states in India. Many people are from illiterate tribal communities and the region is also frequently hit by droughts, floods and cyclones. Nearly half the children leave school at 14 years and are not vaccinated against common childhood diseases.

Read related: Rise of 'nomophobia': More people fear loss of mobile contact . Citta, a charity registered in the U.S. and UK, built a school in Juanga in 2001 and a hospital in 1996. It also runs a women's center which provides pre- and postnatal healthcare and gives seminars to mothers on nutrition and hygiene. The school began with 140 pupils and now has about 400. The hospital, which has five doctors and 10 nurses, is currently the only hospital in the region, serving a community of approximately 100,000 people within a 15 mile (25km) radius. According to mPowering, 46 per cent of people in Juanga live below the poverty line and 41 per cent of children suffer from malnutrition. Read related: In India, more cell phones than toilets . mPowering started working with Citta in 2010, handing 56 families in Juanga a smartphone loaded with culturally customized mobile apps and location analytics (similar to Foursquare) built around the concept of rewards and incentives. Despite some of the villagers having never used a phone, they quickly learned how it worked. Sharing one smartphone per family, the children earn points for attending school and mothers for attending preventative healthcare classes. The families then pool the points and redeem them for food, clothing and medicine each month. Local Indians scan the barcodes on their smartphones when they attend the classes. mPowering has provided phone chargers at schools since many families do not have electricity. Jeff Martin, who founded the non-profit, spent ten years as a senior executive at Apple, six of which he was head of music, entertainment, and marketing, reporting directly to Steve Jobs. He is also the Founder and CEO of Tribal Brands and of Tribal Technologies and has used the technology from those companies at mPowering. He traveled to India extensively during his career at Apple, he says. ""I chose Orissa because it is where the poorest of the poor live. The best way to improve lives in rural areas and change centuries' old traditions is using mobile technology and rewarding people,"" he said. His next plan is to track the art work of the children. ""Through the art work we will be able to see if they are becoming more optimistic,"" he said. ""Fundamentally we are showing connections. We always knew that if kids ate well their grades would improve."" But now he is able to prove it. Donors will be able to see realtime the impact of their donations -- pictures of the children's art work or their grades could be sent to the donors' mobiles for example. Read related: How mobile broadband can transform Africa . A future plan is to give points to mothers when they take their children to health clinics which can be redeemed for medicines. He also aims to give out Lifestraws (portable water filters) to villagers if they watch videos installed on their smartphones about contamination of water, since most water supplies are polluted by the villagers. ""We want more charities to use us,"" Martin said. ""Charities don't currently have a way to measure their own results. But we believe in measurement. No one makes money in Silicon Valley without measurement. I have got various funders behind me and a lot of them feel like I do, that charities need to be measured and mobile analytics is the answer. ""I am not a big believer in micro loans as they create a pressure to pay back a loan. Many people don't want to give money to charities if they don't know how it is being spent. We can actually prove we are changing behaviors."" ""Tribal does the same thing but commercially -- such as changing the way people buy music on their mobile phones and giving them rewards,"" he said. The project has had a measurable impact, mPowering says. The number of reported diseases in the village has reduced from 119 last year down to 52. There were 125 clinic visits this year compared to 98 last year, according to their figures. Seventy-one per cent of children attend school, compared to 52 per cent last year. ""This year every student in the middle school passed the state level exams we were very excited to say the least,"" said Michael Daube, founder and executive director of Citta. ""We have monitored the progress from the start of the project and find almost a 25 per cent increase in enrolment because of the mPowering initiative,"" Daube said. ""mPowering's mission is the perfect extension to increase more efficient support to any poverty-stricken region,"" he added.","In parts of India, people lack basics such as food and water but cell phone towers are often everywhere .

"Washington (CNN) -- Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate in 2008, took aim Sunday at the field of contenders for the 2012 GOP nomination, accusing them of ""isolationism."" ""We cannot repeat the lessons of the 1930s, when the United States of America stood by while bad things happened in the world,"" McCain said in an interview with ABC's ""This Week."" Citing what he viewed as the GOP presidential hopefuls' positions in general on both Libya and Afghanistan, McCain said, ""We are the lead nation in the world, and America matters, and we must lead. But sometimes that leadership entails sacrifice, sadly."" Asked about a threat by House Speaker John Boehner to consider cutting funding for U.S. involvement in the NATO-led military mission, McCain, R-Arizona, responded, ""I was more concerned about what the candidates in New Hampshire the other night said,"" referring to a CNN debate among seven people seeking the Republican presidential nomination. ""This is isolationism,"" McCain said.  ""There's always been an isolationist strain in the Republican Party, the Pat Buchanan wing of our party. But now it seems to have moved more center stage, so to speak."" If former President Ronald Reagan had watched the debate, McCain said, he ""would be saying that's not the Republican Party of the 20th century and now the 21st century. That is not the Republican Party that has been willing to stand up for freedom"" for people all over the world. A bipartisan group of 10 lawmakers has filed suit against the Obama administration, alleging that continuing the U.S. military involvement in Libya without Congressional approval violates the War Powers Resolution.  The Obama administration denies any violation. McCain said every president has disagreed with the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution, ""but they have adhered to it."" ""So the Congress of the United States should pass a resolution -- and Senator John Kerry (D-Massachusetts) and I have the resolution that's ready to go -- that would comply with the War Powers Act,"" McCain said. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi ""was at the gates of Benghazi,"" McCain said.  ""He said he was going to go house to house to kill everybody. That's a city of 700,000 people. What would we be saying now if we had allowed for that to happen?"" Citing the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 and a 1986 Libyan sponsored bombing of a German disco frequented by U.S. soldiers, McCain said Gadhafi has Americans' blood ""on his hands."" ""If Gadhafi remains in power, it's clear that you will see him engage in an escalated effort, of course, to harm the United States of America, obviously,"" he said. McCain was equally adamant that the U.S. mission in Afghanistan must continue. ""We abandoned Afghanistan once, and we paid a very heavy price for it in the attacks of 9/11,"" he said.  ""So that is an important lesson that we must learn."" In the CNN debate, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, currently leading the pack of GOP hopefuls in polls, said ""it's time for us to bring our troops home as soon as we possibly can, consistent with the word that comes from our generals that we can hand the country over."" McCain took issue with that. ""I wish that candidate Romney and all the others would sit down"" with General David Petraeus, commander of the war in Afghanistan, ""and understand how this counterinsurgency is working and succeeding,"" McCain said.","NEW: McCain: If Gadhafi remains in power, he will try to harm the United States .

"(CNN) -- Christopher Lloyd picked through the charred remnants of his Montecito, California, home Monday morning, resigning himself to the fact it cannot be rebuilt.

""Boy, look at that,"" Lloyd said as he approached the rubble. ""All this happens in a couple of minutes."" Lloyd's home was among dozens of homes lost in wildfires in Southern California. The ""Tea Fire"" which started at the privately owned Tea Garden Estate, about a mile north of Santa Barbara's Westmont College, ripped through an area that Oprah Winfrey, Michael Douglas, Rob Lowe and other celebrities call home.

"(CNN) -- Although the bombs went off miles from her house, the young woman in Damascus still felt them in her gut. Boom! Her windows rattled as she ran to her computer. ""What happened?!?!?!?"" she typed furiously into Skype, sending the message to her friends. What Alexia Jade heard was the thunderous clap of two car bombs exploding outside a Syrian air force intelligence compound outside Damascus Monday night. The web of tweeters, Facebookers and Skypers that have helped keep younger Syrians informed about the war that's been raging in their country the past year and a half answered her soon enough. ""It was a moment of slight shock when I knew that the blast was in the air force intelligence branch,"" she told CNN. ""I have always heard stories about that place. Former detainees call it a hellhole. ""It is certainly one of the worst detaining centers ever."" Alexia Jade is not her real name. The young woman is an activist who has protested against the Syrian government, and she insisted on using an alias to protect her against reprisals for talking to reporters. Air force intelligence, known as the AFI, is considered the elite, primary agency of Syria's intelligence matrix. There are 17 branches of Syrian intelligence, according to Syrian experts. President Bashar al-Assad relies on AFI to gather information on rebels fighting to oust him. The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights raised the possibility that ""hundreds of regime forces"" were killed in the attack, but concrete casualty figures were impossible to obtain. Government opponents also said they feared for the lives of ""hundreds if not thousands of anti-government detainees that are being held in the basements of the air force security compound."" The strike could hurt al-Assad because the intelligence agency is such an important branch of the president's security and spying apparatus. ""Depending on the number of people killed, this could be a severe blow to the regime,"" said David Lesch, a Trinity University Middle East history professor who spent a good deal of time with al-Assad in Syria before the uprising, interviewing him and those close to him. Lesch has written two books about Syria and the Assads. ""A strike at a compound like that could be a major blow symbolically but also practically with all the listening devices and tools perhaps destroyed,"" he said. The air force intelligence agency runs detention facilities in major cities. In one Human Rights Watch report this year, former detainees described being beaten, whipped and electrocuted and burned with hot water and acid in a center run by air force personnel. In one account, a detainee said he was forced into a ""flying carpet"" position -- where someone is forced onto their belly as their arms and hands tied are tied behind them. Some detainees said they were strung up by their hands for hours at a time. The use of torture by those who ostensibly answer to the regime has been well-documented throughout the Syrian war. Susan Ahmad, a 31-year-old teacher who lives in a Damascus suburb, recalled feeling creeped out every time she walked past the compound. ""It was a dirty place, horrifying,"" she said. ""I know deep in my heart there are innocent people down there being tortured. I could smell blood and hear the sounds of screams. I feel death is there."" She also felt the bombs go off. ""It was a very noisy night and hectic,"" she said. ""There were many explosions around Damascus."" Al-Assad's army shelled Ahmad's neighborhood. She figured it was in retaliation for the bombs. ""It was clear they were freaking out and just shooting and shelling randomly,"" she said. ""They are really intimidated and when they get afraid, they just start shooting everywhere at anything that moves in every part of Damascus."" ""It is the worst feeling in the world,"" she continued. ""The sound of the mortar when it flies directly above your building -- sssssssssss -- through the air. You lose your breath for a moment and deep in your heart you know someone was killed. ""It's really hard and really painful. I would rather be shelled than hear the sound of shelling in other areas."" Rebels fighting to oust al-Assad told CNN that they fear many detainees were killed in the blasts. Opposition forces are not the ones claiming to have targeted the Air Force Intelligence compound. ""We... fear for the lives of hundreds if not thousands of anti-government detainees that are being held in the basements of the air force security compound,"" said Rami Abdulrahman of the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. A shadowy jihadist group called al Nusra Front claimed to have set off the bombs, according to an online statement that appeared on jihadist websites Tuesday. The organization came to prominence during the Syrian uprising, and has claimed several high-profile strikes at the heart of the Syrian capital in the past several months. The group explained that Tuesday's attack had three stages: first, a suicide car bomb carrying 9 tons of explosives detonated at the gates of the building; second, 25 minutes later, a suicide bomber drove an ambulance carrying 1 ton of explosives, detonating where air force troops were awaiting treatment; third, a mortar barrage aimed at the site of the blast. Lesch pointed out that even if an entire building were decimated, many other parts of the intelligence apparatus remain in Syria. The al-Assad family established the complex web to ensure that no single group had power, and other groups could step in if one group was undermined. The singular importance of the AFI goes back to Hafez Assad, Bashar's father, Lesch explained. Hafez Assad was a commander in the air force in the 1960s before a coup enabled him to take control of Syria in 1970. ""The air force intelligence has always been close to the Assad family,"" he said. As the war has dragged on, Bashar al-Assad has repeatedly blamed ""terrorists"" for the violence in his country. Opposition fighters blame his regime for causing most of the bloodshed. Between these two versions stands what has become increasingly apparent -- there are likely jihadists and foreign fighters active in Syria. Some of these fighters are with groups linked to al Qaeda. Their presence, many experts say, makes it far less likely that the West would involve itself in the Syrian conflict. Last September, Alexia Jade said, a Syrian air force intelligence officer pointed his gun at her head. The air force was trying to break up an anti-al-Assad protest. ""There was one thing in his eyes,"" she said. ""'Shoot the target.' It did not matter that I was a woman."" Some of the protestors created a diversion near the air force officer, shouting and yelling at him. He turned and they all scattered. Jade and her friends escaped, she said, but four people were killed in the protest that day. Everyone fears the air force intelligence branch of the Syrian military, she said. Susan Ahmad believes the regime has laid down increasing firepower to get back at those it perceives have attacked it. She also used an alias, fearing reprisals if she spoke to a reporter using her real name. ""They arrest more people, humiliate more people, harass more people,"" she said. ""Maybe it's a way of boosting the soldiers' confidence. They let them do what they want and kill who they want."" On Tuesday morning, Ahmad still headed to her teaching job in central Damascus. She couldn't take public transportation. All roads leading to the capital were closed, and men at a checkpoint would not grant entry to most civilians, she said. ""The city is closed,"" Ahmad said. ""All cars were forced to turn around, so the roads are empty."" Businesses are closed. Read more: Who is arming the Syrian conflict? The blasts were among a barrage of explosions, gunfire and shelling reported from the Damascus area early Tuesday, suggesting the civil war may be zeroing in further on the Syrian capital. ""This is the largest blast I have ever felt since the uprising began,"" said Omar al-Khani, an opposition activist. ""One of my windows is blown out, and neighbors' plates were knocked down from the table to the ground."" Less than half an hour later, al-Khani said, there was another explosion, followed by intermittent gunfire as a thick plume of smoke unfurled across the capital.

At least one person was killed and several homes destroyed ""due to the heavy and indiscriminate shelling"" of the suburb, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. There were also reports of shelling in Aleppo and Idlib provinces. Rebel forces took complete control of the town of Maaret al-Numan in Idlib province after 48 hours of clashes and shelling from regime forces. A highway connecting Damascus to Aleppo runs through the town. Omar Abo alHoda, a citizen journalist in Idlib province, told CNN that over a year ago, Syrian troops set up eight military posts in the town, which has a population of about 140,000 people. The bases were to protect the highway from opposition attacks, with each post having between 70 and 100 Syrian troops, along with tanks, heavy and light weapons among other resources, he said. Local residents claim troops used the posts as bases to launch attacks on civilian areas. On Monday afternoon, thousands of rebel troops overran the military posts, using tanks, rocket fire, rocket-propelled grenades and gunfire, alHoda said. The regime responded with heavy firepower. Some troops were killed, the journalist said, and others were captured by the opposition. Twenty-nine people were killed in Idlib, the LCC said. In another Damascus suburb, Daraya, at least 25 bodies clustered together were found burned, the opposition group said. The LCC said 197 people were reported dead across Syria on Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Border Patrol agent believed killed in a friendly fire shooting near the Arizona-Mexico border died of a gunshot wound to the head, an autopsy report revealed. The report released Wednesday by the Pima County Medical Examiner's office determined Nicholas J. Ivie, 30, of Provo, Utah, died from what was described as a ""penetrating gunshot wound of the head involving the brain."" Ivie was killed and another agent was wounded on October 2 in a shootout near Naco, Arizona, after responding to a sensor that had gone off near the border, according to U.S. Customs and Border Enforcement. The FBI has said there are strong indications in its preliminary investigation that Ivie was killed as a result of an accidental shooting that involved only Border Patrol agents. At the time, a law enforcement official said investigators at the scene found only shell casings believed to have been fired by the Border Patrol agents. Ivie was killed near a border station recently named for Brian Terry, whose 2010 death led to the public disclosure of the botched Fast and Furious gun-smuggling sting.

"(CNN) -- The bodies of a man and a girl were found inside a vehicle belonging to a suspect in an Amber Alert case, authorities said. Authorities believe 2-year-old Madeline Samaan-Fay was abducted by her father, Mourad ""Moni"" Samaan. An Amber Alert was issued Friday for Madeline, who was last seen a week ago in Sacramento. In a written statement, the FBI in Sacramento, California, said the bodies were found in Samaan's vehicle Saturday night but did not identify the bodies, saying more information would be released later. The green Toyota 4Runner was found in a remote area of El Dorado County, near Placerville, California, the FBI said. ""The Amber Alert system has been put in place so that we can hopefully locate and safely take people back into custody and put the child back, if that's the case,"" El Dorado County Sheriff's Office spokesman Lt. Bryan Golmitz told CNN affiliate KCRA. ""When you end up with cases like this, it's tough."" Calls made Sunday afternoon to the FBI and sheriff's office, inquiring about the identity of the two bodies were not immediately returned. In an earlier news release, the FBI described the father as a 49-year-old Egyptian-born U.S. citizen. The federal agency called the circumstances of the abduction ""particularly concerning,"" adding that officials have reason to believe that the child's life may be in danger. The girl, Madeline, has brown hair and brown eyes, weighs about 28 pounds and stands 2 feet, 8 inches tall, according to the Amber Alert. The FBI was working on the case along with members of the Sacramento Police Department, the Sacramento County Sheriff, the California Highway Patrol and the California Department of Justice.","NEW: A sheriff's spokesman says ""when you end up with cases like this, it's tough""

"(CNN) -- The message sent by the military council that rules Egypt was simple: ""Don't mess with Egypt's armed forces."" The message received by the activists who flooded Tahrir Square 18 months ago: ""Egypt's revolution, which began with a bang, is ending with a whimper."" With several decrees, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces -- a body of 20 generals - moved to neuter civilian authority and give itself unprecedented powers. It got some help from the Supreme Constitutional Court. The timing was hardly coincidental. The candidate of the Muslim Brotherhood was running strongly in the final round of the presidential election against a former Egyptian Air Force general. [Read more about the candidates] . What many observers are calling a ""constitutional coup"" has serious implications not only for the prospect of democracy in Egypt, but also for the future of the Arab world and for the close relationship between Washington and Cairo. Conflicting reports about whether Mubarak has died . The drama began Thursday, when the Court ruled to expel one-third of the parliament entrusted with drafting a new constitution. The court held that the entire parliament, in which the Muslim Brotherhood and allies have a majority, had to be disbanded. The court's ruling was ""absurd, destructive and essentially voids Egypt's last year of politics of meaning,"" Marc Lynch wrote in Foreign Policy. The director of the Institute for Middle East Studies said the country was going through the ""stupidest transition in history."" ""With Egypt looking ahead to no parliament, no constitution and a deeply divisive new president, it's fair to say the experiment in military-led transition has come to its disappointing end,"" Lynch wrote. While Egypt dealt with upheaval, its justice ministry (part of the government appointed by the ruling military council) extended the powers of military police and intelligence agents, allowing them to arrest civilians for a wide range of offenses, including protesting. Late Sunday, Egyptians had still gone ahead and voted in the presidential election. The United States Embassy in Cairo tweeted Monday: ""We congratulate Egypt on this presidential race. It's a historic event 4 democracy in Egypt."" Hours later, the view from the U.S. State Department seemed different. ""We are particularly concerned by decisions that appear to prolong the military's hold on power,"" said spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. Meanwhile, the Supreme Council announced that an appointed assembly would draft the constitution, replacing the assembly chosen by the elected parliament. The Supreme Council also announced it would ""decide all matters related to military affairs,"" including the country's defense budget. There would be no civilian oversight, they said. Egyptians already appeared to be losing faith in politics, with a low turnout in voting between the Muslim Brotherhood's candidate, Mohammed al-Morsi, and Ahmed Shafik, who was Mubarak's last prime minister. Now, whoever wins could discover the office of the president has much lesser authority than it did before. Nobel Laureate Mohamed ElBaradei, himself once a presidential contender, tweeted: ""Electing president in the absence of constitution and parliament is electing an 'emperor' with more powers than deposed dictator. A travesty."" ElBaradei was once considered a sell-out by disappointed leaderless revolutionaries for not participating in this year's presidential race. Whatever their ultimate goal, Egypt's traditional institutions are reasserting themselves in the face of an unpredictable political landscape. The Supreme Constitutional Court is afraid the Muslim Brotherhood plans to reform the judicial system, said Steve Cook, a senior fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. Nathan Brown, a political science professor at George Washington University, agrees. ""The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces and the Court have a similar outlook, regarding themselves as guardians of the Egyptian state -- with responsibilities above politics,"" he said. ""Both felt threatened by the prospect of a Muslim Brotherhood-dominated system. The Egyptian military has now become a state within a state, with oversight of the political system and the constitutional process,"" Brown said. All four Egyptian presidents over the past 60 years have been former military men. The military and retired generals, like their counterparts in Pakistan, run important state enterprises, overseeing everything from food manufacturing to running hotel resorts. But what's new and unusual in Egypt is that the military had put itself beyond civilian control. It is ""the locus of power, authority and legitimacy in the system, without having to run the country on a day-to-day basis,"" Cook said. Debate rages over whether this power grab was the military's plan all along, or whether it has reacted to events. Michael Hanna, an analyst at the Century Foundation, thinks it was the latter. ""Over the past several months, they saw that the political climate had shifted in their favor and consequently regained their confidence,"" he said. ""They knew the revolutionaries had lost support on the streets and were viewed negatively, so they seized the opportunity."" Many Egyptians still feel the military is something to be proud of, a sentiment shared especially among the poor who are more concerned that Egypt becomes stable and they can provide for their families. In the Upper Egyptian rural governorate of Asyut, home to many young people who have served in the military, factory worker Mohammed Nour, 23, praised the military. ""The military and the people are still one hand,"" he said. ""The military alone can save Egypt and make us one of the greatest countries in the world."" Meanwhile, secular pro-democracy activists who took to Tahrir Square last year are wringing their hands. The very democratic structure they dreamed of appears to have withered in part because they developed no unifying ideology. They appeared to have no plan for a post-Mubarak Egypt. They failed to get solidly behind a single presidential candidate, not least because several possible contenders were disqualified. Mahmoud Salem, a popular blogger who has journaled the revolution and goes by the name Sandmonkey, said the pro-democracy movement has itself to blame. ""You successfully dethrone a tyrant, and you have neither plan nor vision on what to do afterwards, and no real understanding of the regime itself,"" he posted. But he also criticized reformers who voted for the Muslim Brotherhood's presidential candidate simply because he was not the ""counter-revolutionary."" ""Our revolution called for a civil state: nonreligious, nonmilitary, and this guy will try to form a religious military state,"" Salem wrote about Morsi. Cook said he believes that the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces won't be swayed by reaction from the United States. The United States gives $1.3 billion in annual aid to Egypt, an amount second only to aid the United States provides to Israel. ""The question is, Does anyone in Cairo care?"" he said. ""The answer is yes and no. It is clear that the [top military commander and de facto leader of Egypt] Field Marshal [Mohamad ] Tantawi and his colleagues are giving far more weight to their domestic interests than the potential consequences with the United States."" But a note from U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta to Tantawi to ""ensure a full and peaceful transition to democracy"" appears to have fallen on deaf ears. Cook wrote the recent book, ""The Struggle for Egypt: From Nasser to Tahrir Square,"" chronicling the influence of the military in Egyptian national politics. Cook said the level of aid has been static since the early 1980s. ""Historically, the military aid program was intended to help secure peace between Egypt and Israel, establish an ally that could be an asset for military contingencies in the Gulf and be a partner to prevent Soviet penetration of the region,"" he said. ""Now, we are basically paying for access to airspace and transit through the Suez Canal."" ""Now isn't the time to publicly threaten to end U.S. aid, in the midst of an extremely volatile and fluid situation,"" Lynch said. ""But it is the time to forcefully convey to the SCAF privately that the transfer to civilian rule really does matter to the U.S."" Shadi Hamid, research director at the Brookings Doha Center, disagreed. ""The U.S. has to show that it's on the side of Egyptian democracy and willing to stand up for it publicly,"" he said. ""Frankly it has to undo damage. Obama's policy toward the Arab Spring has been completely reactive. We wait until something disastrous happens when we should have anticipated it months ago."" The political chaos and an ever worsening economy appears to have induced a sense of resignation among Egyptians. The turnout in Sunday's run-off vote and the prospect of the Muslim Brotherhood joining forces with secular activists in defense of democracy seems remote. Some secularists even take solace from the dissolution of the parliament, thinking they may do better in fresh elections. But that shouldn't be confused with stability, warns Lynch. If Shafik is declared the victor, ""he will preside over a country in economic collapse, with little prospect of restoring investor confidence any time soon."" Mahmoud Salem, aka Sandmoney, said the pro-democracy movement must start over. ""Do something except running around from demonstration to march to sit-in,"" he wrote. ""Real street work means that the street you live in knows you and trusts you, and will move with you, because you help them and care for them, not because you want to achieve some lofty notions you read about in a book."" But with a people more exhausted than incensed by 18 months of uncertainty, finding the determination for another uprising won't come easily. Fast facts on the life of Hosni Mubarak .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda of Japan dissolved the lower house of the country's parliament on Friday, setting the stage for a general election next month that is expected to bring losses to his party. The decision, made under pressure from the main opposition Liberal Democrat Party (LDP), is likely to prove unpopular with some members of Noda's own party, the Democratic Party, which has been in power for a little over three years. And it may cost him his job. In office since September 2011, Noda is a the latest in a string of politically fragile Japanese leaders. He is the sixth prime minister in the six years since the departure of Junichiro Koizumi, who was in power for more than five years. Approval ratings for Noda and his cabinet have sagged deeply in the polls, as Japan has failed to haul itself out of the economic morass in which it has stagnated for the past two decades. Many members of his party fear losing their seats in an election. But with the Japanese government heading toward a financial crunch, Noda agreed earlier this week to dissolve the lower house of parliament if the LDP gave its support to key legislation, including a vital bill that enables the government to keep financing itself. That bill was passed Friday by the upper house, where the opposition holds sway. In cabinet revamp, Japan's Noda brings in woman with China ties . Noda followed through on his side of the deal later Friday by dissolving the lower house of parliament and thus setting in motion the election process. Lawmakers called out ""banzai, banzai,"" an expression of enthusiasm, as the speaker of the house, Takahiro Yokomichi, read out the letter of dissolution. According to the Japanese constitution, the election must be held within 40 days of the dissolution. Noda's office said that leaders of the Democratic Party have agreed to push for an election date of December 16, which will be set by a steering committee. Based on current forecasts in Japan, neither of the two main parties is likely to secure enough votes in the election to form a majority government. The LDP is led by Shinzo Abe, a former prime minister who stepped down citing health reasons in 2007 after only a year in office. Despite the bleak election prospects for his party, Noda was left with little choice this week other than to strike a deal with Abe. Failure to get the crucial financial bill through the LDP-controlled upper house would have left the government in danger of running out of cash. Members of the upper house are elected according to a different schedule from the lower house. Japan: Get ready for a rightward shift . The potential stalemate between the two main parties at the lower-house election next month raises the prospect of a period of deal-making with smaller parties in the legislature to form a coalition. Independent parties have proliferated in Japan recently, with the former Democratic Party leader Ichiro Ozawa leading a breakaway in July that weakened Noda's majority. And the outspoken nationalist Shintaro Ishihara resigned as governor of Tokyo last month in order to form his own party and run for parliament. The big question is whether the government that emerges from the election will have the unity and vision to enact measures to get the country out of its economic woes. Data released this week showed the Japanese economy contracted at an annual rate of 3.5% in the latest quarter, suggesting it risks slipping back into recession. A bitter territorial dispute with China has infected trade relations between the two Asian economic giants. Chinese consumers have been shunning Japanese goods because of the spat, sharply dragging down sales in the country for car makers like Toyota and Nissan. More broadly, the country is wrestling with a huge debt burden and an increasingly aging population, challenges that analysts say will require bold reforms to tackle. CNN's Junko Ogura in Tokyo, and Jethro Mullen in Hong Kong contributed to this report.","The dissolution of parliament follows a deal between Japan's two main political parties .

"(CNN) -- Mangled metal, puffs of smoke, chunks of concrete, blood and a crowd of people walking around dazed, shocked and crying. That was the scene on a Damascus street Friday after a car bomb exploded and killed several people. Some of the dead were reported to be children. The blast seemed to mock the truce that the Syrian government and rebels agreed to abide by earlier this week. The truce, negotiated by the United Nations' special envoy to Syria, was supposed to last during Eid al-Adha, the four-day Muslim holiday that celebrates the end of the Hajj. A Syrian purportedly at the scene captured a video and posted it on YouTube. CNN cannot verify that the footage is authentic, just like so many amateur videos shot during a war that foreign journalists have been blocked from covering. Rebels said the blast went off near a playground. This kind of violence isn't normal in a neighborhood such as Zouhr, a government-held stronghold. Zouhr has been generally quiet; there are still pockets in the capital city that have avoided chaos. That explains why parents might believe that they could safely bring their kids to a playground to celebrate Eid. There's a mosque nearby, and it's customary to gather with family and pray to mark the holiday. About 15 minutes after the blast, Syria security forces showed up and shot directly at someone filming the scene, a source who CNN has spoken with before inside Syria recounted. CNN is not naming her to protect her safety. ""The people were mad with grief, with rage,"" she said. A small demonstration formed, as Syrians chanted against the Assad regime, she said. They immediately blamed President Bashar al-Assad's forces for the bomb. ""The whole neighborhood came down to the street,"" she said. ""It is really outrageous. We are enraged! Kids! In a playground! The families were trying to take them out of the environment of death and blood for one day,"" she said. ""For one day they were trying to make them forgot the bombs and the bullets that are surrounding us."" It's unclear who was behind the bombing. Syrian state media blamed the blast on ""terrorists,"" a line the government has used since the beginning of the movement against al-Assad began in March 2011. Officials have constantly argued that the government has a right to respond to ""terrorist"" attacks, including bombings, as well as ""terrorists"" trying to reinforce their positions. In almost two years, more than 32,000 people have died in battles involving rebels and al-Assad's forces. There are also jihadist elements operating in Syria, CNN has reported. A woman speaking for anti-government rebels blamed Syrian forces, and told CNN that most of the dead were children. Syrian state media reported that five people were killed and 32 wounded. Rebels said 10 were dead. Because Syria has restricted the access of international journalists in the country, CNN can't confirm reports of violence. Rebels said the blast occurred in a public square where families were celebrating Eid. Their spokeswoman was not at the scene but said she was receiving reports from those who were. The car bomb was perhaps the worst of the reported violence, but there were other incidents. At least 103 people were killed around the nation Friday, according to opposition groups. Both sides accused the other of violating the cease-fire. ""We are, again, calling on both sides not just to talk the talk, but to walk the walk, and we have seen some violations on both sides,"" said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. Earlier in the capital, snipers fired from buildings. Soldiers shot protesters elsewhere in the country. Video on YouTube purportedly shows men walking down a street in Damascus carrying guns. Constant gunfire can be heard as well as a man repeatedly saying ""Allahu Akbar,"" or God is great. CNN is unable to authenticate the footage. The idea of a cease-fire was met with skepticism immediately after it was floated on Wednesday. Diplomats, experts in the region and rebels predicted that the agreement would fail. They said Wednesday and Thursday that the effort would just be a repeat of a cease-fire failure in April. By sunrise Friday, thousands of people poured into the streets across Syria to protest against al-Assad. Why region fears al-Assad's 'blackmail' in Beirut . Rebel groups reported these additional bouts of violence across the country: . At least three people were killed in tank and sniper fire in a Damascus suburb where government forces have been battling rebel forces on-and-off for control. Fierce fighting broke out between government forces and the al Qaeda-linked al Nusra Front, which had said earlier it would not abide by the terms of the temporary truce. The al Nusra fighters laid siege to a military encampment east of the city of Maaret al-Numan. Government forces shelled a neighborhood in the flashpoint city of Homs where the opposition alleged six rockets fell, wounding two people and damaging a number of buildings. Video of the alleged destruction appeared on YouTube. At least three people suffered gunshot wounds when Syrian forces fired shots in the air in an attempt to disperse protesters in the town of Inkhil in Dara province. On the rebel side, a top Free Syrian Army general said Thursday his fighters had agreed to halt military operations if the Syrian government were to do so as well. But he said he doubted that the truce would hold. Syria's rebel opposition is fractured, and Gen. Mustafa al-Sheikh said that some rebel groups have not agreed to halt operations. The government, meanwhile, touted its several goodwill efforts Thursday leading to its announcement that it will stop fighting. State-run TV aired footage of men walking out of a prison -- part of a government amnesty program, a commentator said. The release came a week after rebel fighters told Al Jazeera news agency that they would agree to a proposed cease-fire only if the government were to release detainees, end a siege in the city of Homs and halt aerial attacks.

"(CNN) -- ""Rethinking grid dependence in new climate reality."" That was my sole tweet in the aftermath of Sandy, sent after four long nights with my wife and daughter in our cold, dark living room, cut off from the infrastructure -- and the people -- that normally keep us going. Indeed, in a reality where charging a cell phone requires finding a friend who not only admits to having power but also agrees to let you come over and plug into it, the relationship of self-sufficiency to community resources takes on a whole new meaning. And it reflects not only the core themes of the election, but also the main conceptual challenges facing our society at the dawn of the digital age: Do I depend on the collective, or do I go it alone? 'Insane,' 'inspiring' New York polling places in Sandy's wake . In the hard-hit areas of Lower Manhattan, Queens, Jersey and the unlucky suburbs, people who had their own generators, supplies, and wood stoves fared better than those of us depending on downed wires, closed supermarkets, and electrically ignited furnaces for power, food, and heat -- at least for a while. Some offered extension cords from their homes, or even a spot on the floor to sleep. Others nodded in acknowledgment when they heard of our misfortune, but offered no help -- as if they didn't understand that we were suffering from more than the inconvenience of no cable TV. Their quizzical looks seemed to say, why should their own success -- but for the grace of God, in many cases -- obligate them to help others? LZ: Obama still fighting for those who are hurting . This all changed soon enough, when they lost the ability to find gasoline to power those generators, ice to keep the food cool, or dry firewood to burn. Then they were out scavenging for resources like the rest of us. In my little world of media and technology, self-sufficiency had more to do with having chosen to keep copies of all of my work files, computer programs, and entertainment right on my own devices rather than depending entirely on the miracle of cloud computing. This meant that when my family finally evacuated our frigid home (turns out fireplaces don't make much heat), we could bring my book drafts and my daughter's American Girl movies along with us. I'm no doomsday prepper, but I have always had reservations about relegating my files to the servers of others. When we finally arrived at the closest open hotel room to our home in New York's suburbs -- it was downtown Philadelphia -- we didn't bother with any of our technology, anyway. My daughter was excited to see and play with other kids -- families relocated by FEMA from devastated parts of New Jersey, arriving at the hotel with dogs, hotel vouchers, and printed Google maps. Now that I was in a hotel lounge with working WiFi, I really didn't care anymore about whether my work was getting done, or whether I could dazzle my Twitter followers with any insights or witticisms about this whole mess. I didn't care about the election or about the New York Marathon, or least of all about e-mails about work. Anthony Bourdain says help NYC restaurants: Eat out, tip big . Instead, I sat in a hotel lounge with working WiFi, and along with a half dozen dads my age, watched our childhood rock 'n' roll heroes -- Springsteen, Aerosmith, and Billy Joel -- perform at a telethon over images that may as well have been our own neighborhoods: fallen trees, crushed homes, families wading through the floods. Sting came on and did a strange, acoustic version of Message in a Bottle. There with my fellow displaced Sandy victims, I realized that I, for the first time, was on the other side of the telethon. I was the one ""sending out an S.O.S."" Although I had fared a lot better than the poor denizens of Breezy Point or the Rockaways and I wasn't going to be seeking a FEMA reimbursement or need help rebuilding my home, I was still on the victim's end of the equation. I was the person looking to be shared with rather than looking how to share (or hoard) what I had. With found time to rethink my approach to life and its inevitable disasters, zombie apocalypse scenarios playing out in my head, it became clear to me that the ideological divide America seems to be facing is a false one. Those of us needing help weren't lazy or weak, and those in a position to provide it were able to do so only by virtue of collective resources. Opinion: Jersey Shore, I'll miss you . The only home generators that worked all week, for example, irrespective of the long lines at the pump, were the ones that used natural gas, itself the product of the energy grid. The men getting in fights over the few available gasoline generators being sold out of the back of trucks at the local Home Depot (as a 125-pound intellectual, I didn't stand a chance) may have proven their muscle, but ended up with at best three hours of heat before they went in search of nonexistent fuel. See, what we used to call the commons -- the resources and technologies used by everyone -- are what make individual success even possible. A shared resource like the Internet may allow great entrepreneurs to break from the pack to achieve wild success, but they need to continue to invest in the commons, not as a form of charity or penance but as a self-interested strategy for their own sustainability.

"Toulouse, France (CNN) -- The suspect in a deadly shooting spree at a Jewish school in France knows he is being hunted and might carry out another attack, Paris Chief Prosecutor Francois Molins warned Tuesday. He said the killer is ""very determined"" and has committed premeditated murders, targeting victims based on their race or religion. ""The criminal is anti-Semitic or terrorist,"" Molins said. ""One does not exclude the other."" The shooting on Monday was the third fatal attack on minorities in southwest France in eight days. The region remains on scarlet alert, the highest level in France, after a teacher and three children -- two of them his own young sons -- were gunned down Monday at Ozar Hatorah, a Jewish school in Toulouse. The other victim, the daughter of the school's director, was killed in front of her father. In Monday's incident, a man wearing a motorcycle helmet and driving a motor scooter pulled up in front of the Jewish school just before 8 a.m. and started shooting, authorities said. He shot his victims in the head, local journalist Gil Bousquet said. The gunman then fled, Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet said. The same method was used in the earlier soldiers' shootings. One of the guns used Monday was also used in the killings of French soldiers of North African and Caribbean origin on March 11 and March 15, said Elisabeth Allannic, a spokeswoman for judicial authorities in Paris. The first victim was a 39-year-old man, shot in Toulouse, while the other two were 24 and 26, according to French authorities. A court in Paris has opened an investigation into the three killings, under anti-terrorism powers. It is the first time a scarlet alert has been declared, French media reports say. The status means the state can implement sweeping security measures to guard against an imminent threat of major terrorist attacks. Measures include increased security at schools, heightened surveillance of Jewish and Muslim sites, restrictions on traffic and access to public buildings, additional police on duty and extra scrutiny of passengers and baggage on public transport, the local Haute-Garonne authorities said Monday in an online statement. France, with one of the largest Jewish populations in Europe, had 389 reported acts of anti-Semitism in 2011, according to the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France, known by the French acronym CRIF. The group issued a statement saying that while it is too early to determine definitively the motive for the crime, it appears to be a case of anti-Semitism. It called for increased security at places of worship and study as the investigation continues. Exceptional measures have been put in place to find the suspect as soon as possible, Molins told reporters in Paris. Investigators must verify witness accounts and analyze some 7,800 hours of surveillance footage, he said. The witness accounts indicate that the criminal is slim and around 1.75 meters tall (5 foot, 9 inches), he said. All the victims were shot in the head at point-blank range, he added. Interior Minister Claude Gueant said authorities are investigating the possibility that neo-Nazis may have been behind the attacks. The gunman wore a camera on his chest during the attack, Gueant told Europe 1 on Tuesday. The minister said a witness told authorities about the device, but it was not clear whether it recorded the crime, Gueant said. France observed a minute of silence in memory of the victims on Tuesday morning, with President Nicolas Sarkozy marking it at a school in Paris. ""This happened in Toulouse, in a religious school, to children from Jewish families, but it could have happened here,"" he told the students. ""It could have been the same assassin. These children are exactly like you."" Fear, confusion on streets of Toulouse . The bodies of the four victims arrived at Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, said an official with the Consistory of Paris, a group representing Jewish communities. Sarkzoy and Joel Mergui, the president of the Consistory of Paris, were present to receive them. The bodies were to be flown late Tuesday to Israel and buried Wednesday morning in Jerusalem. Sarkozy wrote Monday to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express his condolences for the loss of the victims, three of whom -- the teacher and his sons -- held dual Israeli-French citizenship. The teacher was born and raised in Bordeaux, in southwestern France, but pursued his religious studies in Israel. He married and had children before returning to teach at the Toulouse school, the consistory said. The decision to send the bodies to Israel was made because of their faith rather than their nationality, the consistory said. As practicing Jews, their burial in the birthplace of Judaism ensures that their remains will not be tampered with, it added. Forty percent of French practicing Jews are buried in Israel, the consistory said. Sarkozy, who is running for re-election, suspended his campaign in light of the wave of violence against minorities. France has a complex history with the far right. There has been steady if minority support for the National Front party founded by Jean-Marie Le Pen and now led by his daughter, Marine. The senior Le Pen came in second in the 2002 presidential elections, and his daughter is a candidate this year. Sarkozy himself said in an interview earlier this month that France has too many immigrants. ""Our system of integration is working worse and worse, because we have too many foreigners on our territory and we can no longer manage to find them accommodation, a job, a school,"" he told France 2 TV on March 6. Historian and author Patrick Weil told CNN it is likely that public shock over the attacks will calm the campaign rhetoric directed at minorities. Security heightened in U.S. synagogues . Police in New York, Washington and San Francisco increased patrols of synagogues and Jewish institutions, with New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly citing fears someone might stage a ""copy-cat"" attack. But he and the city's mayor stressed there was no ""specific"" intelligence indicating an active threat. CNN's Anna Pritchard, Bharati Naik, Jim Bittermann and Dheepthi Namasivayam contributed to this report.","Witnesses describe the gunman as slim, 5-foot-9, prosecutor Francois Molins says .

"(CNN) -- It's been more than a year since NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal retired from the court, and he says he doesn't miss it. The basketball champ has his eye on a new target: diabetes. ""It's alarming,"" says O'Neal. ""We need to come together to try to help prevent the disease and stay healthy."" Nearly 26 million Americans have diabetes, and another 79 million Americans are considered pre-diabetic, according to the American Diabetes Association. Approximately two thirds of diabetics eventually die from heart disease or a stroke. For O'Neal, the fight against diabetes is personal. He was drawn to finding a solution after watching close family members struggle to manage the disease. He's now focusing his energy on preventing people from developing diabetes in the first place. Waist size signals diabetes risk . ""Childhood obesity is getting worse,"" he says. ""People need to know the problem isn't going to go away unless we take control now."" O'Neal spent years taking flak about his fluctuating weight throughout his 19-year NBA career. But the self-proclaimed ""freak of nature"" says there's always been a method to his madness. ""[Critics] would automatically say, 'He's out of shape,' but I wanted to just relax during the summer, hang out with the family, and then work my way into basketball-playing shape,"" says O'Neal. ""I've never been obese. Even now my body fat is only 13%."" Makers of diabetes drug will pay $90 million . Today, the 7-foot tall O'Neal says his current weight stays around 350, ""plus 10,"" but admits it's not easy to stay at a healthy weight and reduce his risk of developing diabetes. O'Neal says he limits the amount of carbohydrates in his diet, eats a salad for lunch everyday and only indulges in an occasional brownie, his vice. He also clocks one hour of cardiovascular activity each day. Diabetes diagnoses increasing at alarming rate . ""It's a different world we live in now,"" says O'Neal. ""I always urge people to eat healthy and ask them to try to help your kids get exercise. I stress the importance of keeping them in shape. It's not about the physical appearance but for their health."" In addition to raising awareness on how to prevent diabetes through a healthy lifestyle, O'Neal says he also wants to help diabetics better manage their disease. He recently invested in a product called glucose quick sticks, which he describes as a healthier alternative for diabetics when their blood sugar is low.","NBA star Shaquille O'Neal says his fight against diabetes is personal .

"Ashkelon, Israel (CNN) -- The rockets come mostly in the morning, the men say, but many of the people of the town of Ashkelon are always afraid. ""We can't go on like this,"" Mayor Benny Vaknin said. ""We have 131,000 people here and 26,000 children. They are constantly under threat."" Rafel Moshe, who was playing backgammon at a pizza place downtown, echoed the mayor's thoughts. ""They don't want peace,"" said Moshe, speaking of the people in Gaza. ""How would you feel if your children were constantly scared?"" Ashkelon, about 15 kilometers from Gaza, has suffered nearly two dozen rocket attacks since the back-and-forth firing of missiles and rockets between the Israeli military and militants in Gaza began Wednesday. Fear, celebration in Gaza City . Vaknin said 20 rockets were launched at Ashkelon in the past 24 hours. The city has an air defense system, the Iron Dome, which is designed to shoot down incoming rockets. At Porto Pizza, the backgammon players said the worst attacks were in the morning, but as a CNN crew found, the rockets could come at any time. Just before 1 a.m the air-raid sirens went off and then there was a noise just a few kilometers away that sounded like an impact from a rocket. No injuries were reported. The city's residents have experience dealing with how to quickly move to air raid shelters and some, like Moshe, have a ""Red Alert"" app for their smart phones that tracks rocket attacks. Israeli warplanes could be heard in the sky and, farther in the distance, the sound of shelling. It was unclear if it was outgoing rockets from Gaza or bombs being dropped. Another group of four jets flew over the city a few hours later as the crew was filing a report. What's behind the conflict . ""We don't want war but there are people all the time shooting at Israel and we are quiet -- we stay quiet -- and the world doesn't see the truth,"" Moshe said.","Israeli town 9 miles from Gaza has had 20 rockets aimed at it .

"(CNN) -- Mother Earth, it's shower time. The planet won't be awash in water early Saturday, but rather meteors. It's part of an annual astronomical event known as the Leonid meteor shower, falling in mid-November as the Earth passes through debris from Comet Tempel-Tuttle. ""We're predicting a normal year of 15 to 20 meteors per hour,"" said Bill Cooke of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office, according to a story on the space agency's website. The fun begins Friday night, with the peak activity expected around 4:30 a.m. ET the next morning, according to NASA. For those wishing to wish on a shooting star, Cooke recommends bundling up, getting away from the city lights and lying on your back (assuming you are able to still stay awake in doing so). One thing that stargazers have working to their advantage, assuming clouds don't muddle the festivities, is the fact the moon is in a crescent setting, meaning its light is less likely to obscure the show. Thankfully, there's no chance the Earth will crash into Comet Tempel-Tuttle this year. It was last in the solar system's inner orbit and closest to our planet in early 1998, NASA explains, and it won't be back for another 33 years. But it left ""a stream of dusty debris,"" known as Leonid meteors, when it moved on through. Some of these remnants have drifted into the Earth's orbital path -- and when our planet passes by, the meteors seem to be falling from the area of the constellation Leo, the lion. The relatively small bits of rock will enter the planet's atmosphere though they won't get far, burning up before they can hit the Earth, according to StarDate magazine, which is a product of the University of Texas' McDonald Observatory.","The Leonid meteor shower occurs every year in mid-November .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan has released nine members of the Taliban from prison in hopes they will help negotiate peace in Afghanistan, a senior Afghan peace negotiator said. They are to receive safe passage back to Afghanistan, Salahuddin Rabbani, chairman of Afghanistan High Peace Council, told reporters in Kabul Saturday. A senior Pakistani intelligence official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, confirmed the release, indicating that many of the prisoners were old-guard Taliban, ranking members from generations past. Two were once ministers in the former Taliban government before the U.S. invaded the country in 2001, he said. The rest were either former government officials or low- to mid-evel commanders. The peace council has attempted to forge peace between the Taliban, the Afghan government and Western powers. It supports Kabul's call to the Taliban to cut its links to al Qaeda. The prisoner release coincided with a recent three-day visit by an Afghan delegation led by Rabbani to Islamabad, which sat down with Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf and religious leaders to solicit their support for the peace process in Afghanistan. The Afghans have requested the discharge of more Taliban, who Rabbani said have agreed to support peace negotiations, and hope that this first release was the just the beginning. The senior Pakistani intelligence official believes more releases are likely, but he is skeptical the released Taliban prisoners will be effective in peace negotiations due to generational conflicts. ""I doubt very much that the current Afghan Taliban will listen to these has-beens,"" he said. A former second-in-command Taliban leader, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, was rumored to have been considered for release but was not among those set free. Rabbani is the son of former Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani, who led the peace council until his assassination in his home at the hand of suicide bombers posing as Taliban peace negotiators in 2011. CNN's Masoud Popalzai reported from Kabul and CNN's Shaan Khan reported from Islamabad.","Taliban members released to help with peace negotiations .

"Washington (CNN) -- A North Carolina man was arrested Wednesday and accused of threatening to kill President Barack Obama in a series of Twitter messages, including one saying, ""The Secret Service is gonna be defenseless once I aim the Assault Rifle at Barack's Forehead."" Donte Jamar Sims, 21, had an initial court appearance in Charlotte on Thursday and remains in custody. According to a criminal complaint, Sims sent five Twitter messages Monday morning threatening the president. ""Ima hit president Obama with that Lee Harvey Oswald swag,"" said one tweet. ""Well IMA Assassinate president Obama this evening, "" said another message. President Obama did not arrive in town until two days later. Protester jailed, denies he's a terrorist . Charlotte is the city hosting the Democratic National Convention. President Obama arrived there Wednesday afternoon in advance of his Thursday night acceptance speech. The court document states a Secret Service intelligence research specialist saw the messages on Twitter, which led to an agent going to Sims' home to interview him on Wednesday. In the affidavit, the Secret Service agent who interviewed Sims said the suspect admitted to having the Twitter account associated with the messages and wrote that Sims smiled when the threatening statements were read aloud to him. ""Sims stated that he published the statements because he hated President Obama,"" the agent wrote in the affidavit. ""Sims asserted that he was high on marijuana when he made the threats but that he understood what he was doing and that it was wrong."" According to the court document, the agent then arrested Sims on several outstanding warrants. The officer said Sims later waived his Miranda rights and said his demeanor changed. ""He asserted that he was sorry he sent the messages threatening to kill the president of the United States and provided me with a written apology,"" wrote the agent. The court document makes no mention of Sims having any weapons in his possession. It also does not provide details on the previous arrest warrants for Sims. Kevin Tate, a federal public defender representing Sims, would not comment on the case in advance of a detention hearing scheduled for September 11. If convicted of threatening the president, Sims faces a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Bal Thackeray, a staunch advocate of Hindu nationalism in India and the leader of a political party that dominated the country's financial capital, died Saturday, his spokesman said. The 86-year-old Thackeray was a charismatic founder and head of Shiv Sena, the nationalist movement most powerful in the city of Mumbai and the Maharashtra state. Spokesman Rahul Narvekar said Thackeray died of cardiac arrest and his cremation will be held on Sunday. Thackeray emerged in the 1960s as a populist leader for the Marathi people, who dominated Mumbai and the Maharashtra state. Once a newspaper cartoonist, he rose to fame for defending Marathi interests as migrants from other communities streamed into the city, known at the time as Bombay. The movement has immense political power in Mumbai, India's financial center and site of the legendary Bollywood film industry. Its symbol is an orange flag, seen planted across Mumbai. Thackeray was instrumental in having the name of Bombay changed to Mumbai, a Marathi name. And Thackeray had developed a reputation among many Indians as a bit of a godfather, revered by his followers but feared by others. Over the years, the Shiv Sena movement grew in popularity across India as a Hindu nationalist movement. Shiv Sena and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appealed for calm after his death was announced, and authorities have deployed police officers across Mumbai in the wake of his death. In a series of Twitter messages, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said Thackeray's leadership helped build Shiv Sena into a ""formidable force"" in Maharahstra. ""He was a consummate communicator whose stature in the politics of Maharashtra was unique,"" Singh said. ""For him the interests of Maharashtra were particularly important and he always strived to inculcate a sense of pride in its people."" People we've lost in 2012: The lives they lived .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Miners at a South African platinum operation where 34 co-workers were killed in a clash with police will end their strike after a wage agreement was reached, officials said Tuesday. Work at the mine will resume Thursday. Zolisa Bodlani, one of the striking miners' representatives, and the National Union of Mineworkers said the workers have accepted the Lonmin mining company's offer of about 9,000 rand (about $1,084) a month for general minimum wage workers and about 11,000 rand (about $1,325) a month for rock drill operators. According to Lonmin's final offer, the total guaranteed pay represents increases of between 11% and 22% more than the miners' pre-strike pay packages, including wages and benefits such as housing allowances and medical aid. The settlement was signed in Rustenburg late Tuesday. Police opened fire on protesters at the Marikana mine last month. South African authorities at first charged 270 miners with murder before dropping the charges pending further investigation. Lonmin said workers also will get a 2,000-rand (about $243) signing bonus. ""These have been difficult and tragic weeks for everyone involved with the company, the communities living around our operations and the South African nation as a whole,"" acting Chief Executive Simon Scott said in a statement. ""Tonight's agreement and the subsequent return to work is only one step in a long and difficult process which lies ahead for everyone who has been affected by the events at Marikana, but it is essential in helping secure the futures of our tens of thousands of employees and all those who rely on Lonmin in the region."" South Africa has witnessed a vicious rivalry between two unions -- the dominant and established National Union of Mineworkers and the splinter Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union, which has been encroaching on the former's role. The National Union of Mineworkers is a close ally of the country's ruling African National Congress (ANC). The striking miners, according to several South African media outlets, felt they not been adequately represented by the battling unions. Political analyst Khehla Shubane said the power of the ANC is perceived to rest on the power of unions. ""No longer will the view that unions will continue to support the ANC uncritically be supported by evidence on the ground,"" Shubane told CNN on Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- A train rammed into a flatbed truck carrying participants in a West Texas parade saluting U.S. troops, killing four people and injuring several others, a police spokesman said. The incident happened around 4:30 p.m. Thursday, during the ""Hunt for Heroes"" event in Midland. According to the group Show of Support, these festivities -- including a banquet and, after that, an ""all expense paid whitetail deer hunt"" -- are to honor members of all branches of the U.S. military. The last flatbed truck in the parade was crossing tracks when an eastbound train slammed into it, said Midland police spokesman Ryan Stout. Some people were able to jump off the truck in time. First responders found two dead at the scene, while two others were later pronounced dead at Midland Memorial Hospital, Stout said. Ten other people were treated and released at the hospital, while five remained hospitalized Thursday night, one of them in critical condition. Marine Corps Chief Warrant Officer 3 Gary Stouffer, 37, and Army Sgt. Maj. Lawrence Boivin, 47, were pronounced dead at the scene. Army Sgt. Joshua Michael, 34, and Army Sgt. Maj.

Parade attendee: 'I'm waving at these guys and then you ... find out this happened' Authorities don't yet know why the truck was on the tracks as the train arrived at the crossing, Stout said. The National Transportation Safety board will initiate an investigation Friday that will include review of video from a camera on the train. The gates and lights at the intersection were working at the time, and the train's two-member crew sounded the horn prior to impact, according to Tom Lange, a spokesman for Union Pacific Railroad. The train included more than 80 rail cars carrying double-stacked containers, he said. The NTSB said it has not confirmed whether the crossing gates and signals were active at the time of the accident. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with family and friends of those affected,"" Lange said, adding that Union Pacific employees are on site and more are heading that way to investigate. Lange said the train itself is operational and its crew was not injured. They are being offered counseling, he said.","NEW: Chief Warrant Officer Gary Stouffer and Sgt. Maj.

"(AOL Autos)  -- Ever get the feeling the cops are driving a much cooler car than you? Peter Falk's Liutenant Columbo drove a Peugeot 403 to match his famously disheveled detective persona. For decades drivers have seen police officers cruise past in supremely cool cars from supercharged Mustangs to upgraded AMC Javelins and beyond, while modern police units often consist of high-powered Dodge Hemis and, in one incredible instance, a Lamborghini. Cops or detectives portrayed on TV and in the movies are no different, often driving fatter rides than the drug-dealers they pursue. But which are the coolest cop rides of all time, real or fictional? Let's take a look. Dodge Charger Hemi . One of the original muscle cars favored by Blue Mountain moonshine and marijuana smugglers to outrun the boys in blue in the 1970s got a swift turnaround a couple years ago with Dodge's earth-shattering introduction of the new Charger, its Hemi engine and its use by police forces across the nation. Officers generally compare it favorably with standard Crown Victoria vehicles and laud its performance and versatility (which I can vouch for having tested the stock R/T last year); upgrades for police use one include steering, brakes and idle-time chip. Almost all are 5.7-liter Hemi variants, which put out a whopping 368hp and top out at 170 mph. AOL Autos: Dodge Charger . 'Knight Rider's' Ford Mustang GT500KR . Forget David Hasselhof's Speak-n-Spell-voiced Trans-Am, we're talking serious muscle with Ford's monstrous Ford Mustang GT500KR that featured in last year's ill-fated reworking of ""Knight Rider,"" a model I also ragged around Los Angeles port about this time last year (and was very careful not to attract the attention of harbor authorities). The most powerful stock car Ford has built, the Shelby variant seethes and stomps its way to a mile a minute in about the same time as a Corvette but shades it for fun thanks to its astonishing 480lb-ft of torque at 4500rpm and solid-axle rear suspension that allows the back end to fly out on fantastic cop-car action sequences. Trivia: K.I.T.T., the 1980s original smartcar, stands for Knight Industries Two-Thousand. AOL Autos: Ford Shelby GT500 . Italian Police Lamborghini Gallardo . Want to make the 424 miles from Turin to Rome in under three hours? Italian police long ago caught on to the race-driver fanaticism of its citizenry thanks in large part to Ferrari -- and perhaps less so to Fiat -- and its polizia made sure they could keep up earlier this year by springing for a Lambo, perhaps the most incredible police vehicle on the planet. Alongside undeniable performance, this specially equipped supercar offers real-time wireless image-and-voice transmitting equipment and a natty cooler for storing crime scene evidence. Initial reports suggest the Gallardo's reliability stands up to punishing police driving habits on Italian autostradas surprisingly well. AOL Autos: Lamborghini Gallardo . Steve McQueen 'Bullitt' Ford Mustang GT . Long before the Cooler King was the main man to seek out at tailgate parties, Steve McQueen took the nickname and turned on a whole generation to the muscle of the Mustang in his 1968 GT 390 Fastback that bounced and careened around the streets of San Francisco, California, in perhaps the era's coolest film, and one which regularly tops the charts of best car chase captured on celluloid. The film pioneered cutaway shots of McQueen, an avid rally driver, as he put the big-block pony through its paces in the 10-minute scene but, unusually for the King of Cool, the main star here was his car. Ford released a limited-edition Bullitt commemorative model in 2008. AOL Autos: Ford Mustang . Green Hornet 1966 Chrysler Crown Imperial . With some suggesting a movie remake of the 1960s cult series is in the works, attention now focuses on what will take the place of the ""Green Hornet's"" 1966 Chrysler Crown Imperial, famously driven by Bruce Lee (in his role of Kato). While the angular and rectangular Black Beauty pioneered gizmos like infrared lights, rocket launchers and flipper license plate more associated with Bond's Aston Martin, it was always Lee and not Van Williams, the Hornet, who got the pleasure of tilting the car onto two wheels to get through narrow alleyways and other criminal hang-outs. Keep your eyes out for the latest movie developments, which may or may not -- but should -- include the famous line: ""Let's roll, Kato!"" 1970s Pony Cars . Judging by the huge rims and lowered suspensions on the Chevy Tahoes currently patrolling Santa Monica beachfront, police departments often like to drop a hint of style and attitude in their rides, too. In the 1970s, decade of Aviator sunglasses and massive sideburns, it was no different. Officers to this day talk about the series of high-performance police vehicles that includes Chevrolet Camaros, Ford Mustangs and the legendary AMC Javelin, all stock V8 power with upgraded brakes and steering that packed more muscles than Bubba in Cell Block D. Most of these specially built units topped out near 150 mph and were especially prized for their straight-line capabilities while an officer in pursuit bumped and nudged his target vehicle in a bid to force them off the road. AOL Autos: Chevy Camaro . ""Miami Vice"" Ferrari Testarossa . The ultimate in machismo cool in its day, though now considered slightly cheeseball, Crockett and Tubbs defined 1980s New Wave slick with their boss combo of boats, 'Bans and Miami Beach swagger. Though the Daytona Spyder 365 driven by the dynamic detectives in the first two series was a kit car replica of various Ferrari panels and equipment bolted onto a Corvette chassis, the twin Testarossas that feature in the later series were donated by Enzo Ferrari, a fan of the show (with an obvious gift for marketing). The Testarossa would go on to define the Ferrari brand in United States in the 1980s, while a strange breed of setose men in linen suits with no socks can still be spotted in corners of Ford Lauderdale to this day. In director Michael Mann's 2006 movie, the Testarossa morphs into a suitably stylish F430. Magnum PI 308GTS . As if Don Johnson wasn't enough 1980s for one list, we add Tom Selleck to the mix in his role as ""Magnum P.I."" without forgetting how much Selleck's silky mustache and coiff did for sales of his trademark targa Ferrari 308GTS in the States. Mid-engined and with the smaller wheelbase common to Ferrari's of the period, 308s sold in record numbers for Ferraris and can still be seen on roads today, indicating that Scaglietti build quality can withstand some serious highway pounding that belies its lightweight fiberglass frame. Selleck steered his on the mean streets of Hawaii, tracking criminals in his role as a private investigator. Not a police vehicle, you say? Selleck's mustache qualifies him as an honorary police officer in my book any day. Columbo's Peugeot 403 . ""And one more thing..."" wraps up our list with Peter Falk's Liutenant Columbo reveling in a dilapidated Peugeot banger to match his famously disheveled detective persona. France's finest prancing lion, a 1.5 liter four-cylinder that put out a mere 68hp, was a perfect fit with Falk's seemingly slow-witted persona that ultimately always got his man in the end. Similarly, the 403, which Columbo delighted in driving the drop-top variant, was a vital cog in Peugeot's dominance of its domestic and European market with a series of idiosyncratic cars beloved by their followers but which remained a Columbo-esque mystery to their detractors. I had the pleasure of driving an excellent Peugeot 307 cabriolet next to a vintage 403 at a motor show in Europe a couple years back, and felt a slight pang that I wasn't wearing a shabby raincoat to match. Blues Brothers Interceptor Mashup . Everyone knows the Blues Mobile -- Jake and Elwood's 1974 Dodge Monaco in ""The Blues Brothers"" movie -- but few know where all the cop cars famously smashed to pieces in the film came from. Paul Anderson, a journalist in Los Angeles, says it was his dad, also Paul, a Chicago, Illinois, police radio engineer who was tasked with fixing up the Dodge Polaras and Monacos wrecked in the film (with the Chicago city council spurred into action by the possibility of Steven Spielberg and John Landis coming to their city to make a big-budget movie). He once recounted to Paul: ""I just remember one day my boss, the lieutenant who always gave me a hard time, came to me and pointed to the auto graveyard where all the out-of-service squad cars were and said, 'See all those cars? Your job is to get them started.' I said, 'Are you kidding?'"" Paul adds: ""[My Dad] had a savant-like ability to rescue beaters from near-death experiences. When the movie came out, he went to see it like everyone else and he could remember each and every one of those cars.""","Officers laud the Dodge Charger Hemi's performance and versatility .

"Washington (CNN) -- If you live in a battleground state, chances are you've seen your share of political ads this election season. They come on during prime-time network TV, pop up while you're cheering on the Buckeyes or the Broncos and they even get you when you're cruising to your favorite station on the way to work. The reason for such a concentrated air war is that voters in swing states like Colorado and Ohio could decide the election. ""A swing state is somewhere where there are persuadable voters,"" said Democratic Strategist and partner at Blue Engine Message & Media, David Di Martino. The ads air in those states because, Di Martino says, ""It's important to battle on the playing field that [those voters] are in."" And that's why in swing states, voters can say they've noticed an increase in the ads. New Romney ads target voters' emotions . ""The frequency [of ads] is mind bending,"" said Bill Stakelin, 69, a retired radio broadcast executive who lives in Cincinnati. ""[There are] a lot [of ads] - pretty much every other commercial it seems like,"" said Erin Mahoney, 32, a Business Manager at Medical Marijuana Center in Frisco, Colorado. Don't look for the number of commercials to let up anytime soon. There are different schools of thought on why and how often to show commercials, but they both agree that frequency works. ""The working principal is that every time that an ad runs, voters are seeing it for the first time,"" said Keith Appell, a Republican strategist and senior vice president at CRC Public Relations. ""There is a second working principal that voters need to see it three, four, five times for it to resonate."" Obama ad argues economic progress under his tenure . But still, voters in these states say it's the tone and content -- or lack thereof -- of ads that bothers them, not their frequency. In Iowa for instance, medical student Katie Ryken, 23, says that voters in the state -- which serves as the first caucus in the primary system -- take pride in their important political position in the country and they are used to not only the attention, but the ""barrage"" of ads that stream across TV screens from Des Moines to Iowa City. ""We take it very seriously,"" Ryken said. ""But I think that I have noticed and what I think what bothers people is the overall negativity of the ads."" ""What's frustrating to me I think that our general population is intelligent enough to absorb real issues,"" Ryken continued, ""and I think that it's disappointing that candidates have to go to attack ads."" Mahoney said the commercials she sees when she isn't fast forwarding through them using her DVR are bothersome for the same reason. ""They really just kind of frustrate me because they say the same thing on both sides, Mahoney said. ""One is that Obama hasn't created jobs, the other is that Romney is shipping jobs overseas...it's more school yard jabs [than substantive arguments]."" Romney ads focus back on economy . Stakelin said that both candidates have a similar message: ""What [the other candidate] is going to do negative to you is to destroy you, your children and your country."" That voters are seeing largely negative ads is true -- and largely on purpose. A CNN analysis of data from the Campaign Media Analysis Center, a non-partisan company that measures the content of political ads, shows that the majority of campaign ads shown across the country and in battleground state are negative. Why? Because, political strategists from both parties say that negative ads work. Crossroads' six ads hit Obama, other Democratic candidates . ""Every election you hear that there are too many negative ads,"" said Appell, ""And in every election they work. That's why in every election you see negative ads."" Di Martino says they work because voters remember the content of negative ads more than they remember the content of positive ads. But he also says that outside spending has caused the number of negative ads to increase in recent history. ""I think the fundamental thing that has changed in the last five to ten years is that more and more ads are not being sponsored by the campaigns ... which are on the ballot,"" said Di Martino. The influx of spending by groups not associated with the campaigns, he says, ""has made the tone of modern campaigns far more negative than they used to be."" As a consumer and also as a retired broadcaster, Stakelin doesn't think that the ads he's seen in this election will prove effective. ""I think that if you're a student of the ad game and politics,"" said Stakelin ""we're going to be able to look at this election and see what was effective [with campaign ads]...That effectiveness is just not there."" Advertising is done, Stakelin says, to plant a seed and get a reaction. But the negativity in the ads from both sides, ""become a turnoff and they basically balance themselves out."" The bottom line from political strategists, Appell says is ""if they weren't effective, campaigns wouldn't run them.""","For swing state voters, it's the tone not the number of ads that have them frustrated .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- California authorities are investigating the death of a worker in an oven at a Los Angeles-area tuna processing plant. The victim, Jose Melena, was cooked to death in a steam oven at the Bumble Bee Foods plant in Santa Fe Springs on Thursday, said Erika Monterroza, a spokeswoman for the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. Melena was a six-year veteran of the plant, which was shut down until Monday, the company said. ""The entire Bumble Bee Foods family is saddened by the tragic loss of our colleague, and our thoughts and prayers are with the Melena family,"" the company said. Monterroza said she could not disclose further details. Worker fatality investigations typically take three to four months to complete. The plant is about 18 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. It processes and cans tuna loin. Melena's job involved pushing baskets of sealed cans into a pressure cooker, and he was considered a skilled and knowledgeable employee, Pat Menke, the company's vice president for human resources, told CNN. The process sterilizes the canned tuna, which is then cooled, dried, labeled and inspected before being shipped to stores, Menke said. CNN's Stella Chan and Irving Last contributed to this report.","NEW: Jose Melena's job was to push baskets of canned tuna into a pressure cooker .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid crashed to a shock 2-1 defeat to city neighbors Getafe in the second round of the Spanish La Liga season Sunday. After being held 1-1 by Valencia in their opener, Jose Mourinho's champions are left with a solitary point after two games, trailing arch rivals Barcelona by five points. Gonzalo Higuain put Real ahead after 26 minutes and they appeared set for a routine derby victory. But Juan Valera was unmarked as he headed Getafe level after 52 minutes from a free kick. Real's star-studded attack led by Cristiano Ronaldo pressed for the winner, but it was the home side who grabbed their second with Abdelaziz Barrada scoring in the 74th minute after an assist by Adrian Colunga. Earlier, Lionel Messi came to Barcelona's rescue with a late double as they beat Osasuna 2-1 to go top of the standings on goal difference from Rayo Vallecano after two games. New Barca coach Tito Vilanova had been sent off for complaining to the referee as they trailed to a 17th-minute goal from Joseba Llorente. The former European champions had wasted a string of chances until Messi struck in the 75th and 80th minutes. Osasuna's Francisco Punal was shown red for his protests after Messi's first goal, claiming he was offside. Barcelona and Real Madrid will resume their rivalry Wednesday as the Catalans take a 3-2 lead to the Santiago Bernabeu after first leg of the Spanish Super Cup. In Serie A, the start of the season has seen contrasting fortunes for the Milan clubs. AC Milan, runners-up last season, lost 1-0 in the San Siro to newly promoted Sampdoria with Andrea Costa scoring the winner in the second half. But Inter Milan showed their city rivals how it should be done with a 3-0 win at another promoted side, Pescara, to top the early standings with Napoli, who won 3-0 at Palermo. On Saturday, Juventus began their defense of the title with a 2-0 victory at home to Parma.","Real Madrid beaten 2-1 by Getafe in La Liga .

"(CNN) -- Rather than getting treated like royalty, an African king got a rude introduction to Norway when thieves made off with his luggage -- with his precious, valuable jewelry tucked inside. The whereabouts of King Otumfuo Osei Tutu II's valuables inside the bag swiped Wednesday from the lobby of the Radisson Blu Plaza Hotel in Oslo remain unknown. Police used surveillance video to identify a man and woman suspected in the theft and are asking for citizens' help in identifying them, acting Oslo Assistant Chief of Police Hege Naustad told CNN on Saturday. While Ghana is a constitutional democracy led by a president since the mid-20th century, it has a rich history beyond that -- including groups that date back centuries, including the Asantes, who are centered inland in the West African nation. The current leader of the traditional Asante kingdom, the 62-year-old King Osei Tutu, remains a prominent figure in Ghana. Based at the Manhyia Palace in Kumasi, he frequently weighs in on issues -- from expressing condolences over the death this summer of Ghanaian President John Evans Atta Mills to promoting development and unity among Asanteman chiefs. As recently as Friday, he asked all politicians ""to refrain from personal attacks and insinuations"" ahead of December elections, according to his website. The king had gone to Oslo to promote his people by taking part in a conference run by the Norwegian African Business Association, according to Naustad. The British-educated monarch landed at the airport in the Scandinavian city Wednesday, and subsequently made his way to the hotel in the city center. It was there in the hotel lobby that one of the king's bags was stolen, the assistant police chief said. The royal jewelry inside the stolen luggage is ""of great value,"" he added. The theft was immediately reported to authorities, with the hotel's surveillance tape soon becoming a key piece of evidence. The video shows a backpack-toting male suspect entering through a revolving door wearing a cap, sunglasses and light pants. The other person pictured is a woman in a head scarf and glasses, wearing light pants, a dark jacket and a dark shirt underneath.","King Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, head of the Asante people, goes to Norway to attend a conference .

"(CNN) -- The Tamil National Alliance, Sri Lanka's largest Tamil political party, on Thursday called for an international inquiry into a U.N. failure to protect civilians during the final stages of the country's bloody 26-year civil war. The request comes a day after the United Nations admitted that it didn't protect hundreds of thousands of civilians, mostly ethnic Tamils, trapped in areas of heavy shelling in Sri Lanka, a teardrop-shaped island nation off India's southern coast. ""The internal inquiry report that has now come to light says the U.N. failed civilians by leaving the area,"" M.A. Sumanthiran, the Tamil National Alliance parliamentarian, told CNN. Sumanthiran was referring to the withdrawal of the U.N.'s international staff from north Sri Lanka's Wanni area. In late 2008, the government could no longer guarantee the safety of U.N. staff there because of intense fighting between its forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, or LTTE, an armed separatist group commonly referred to as the Tamil Tigers. As the U.N. prepared to leave, local civilians pleaded with it to stay, fearing the government would bomb areas where there were no international witnesses. In the report released Wednesday, the United Nations questioned its decision to move its staff ""because of a government safety warning when government forces themselves represented the dominant threat to staff."" The U.N. also acknowledged that it had, on occasion, ""omitted to explicitly mention government responsibility for violations of international law"" so as to not hinder its humanitarian access in the country. The internal review published accounts in which U.N. officials emphasized grave responsibility for civilian deaths with the LTTE but only ""raised concerns"" with the Sri Lankan government. The government of Sri Lanka declared victory in 2009 in its decades-long battle with the Tamil Tiger rebels, who had waged war for an independent state for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka since July 1983. As many as 70,000 people were killed in the conflict. Caught in the crossfire year after year were civilians, thousands of whom were displaced and hundreds killed. In the war's final stage, which lasted from September 2008 to May 2009, the Sri Lankan army advanced into an area of northern Sri Lanka known as the Vanni, where about 330,000 people were trapped by fighting. A U.N. report in 2011 said the government used ""large-scale and widespread shelling"" that left large numbers of civilians dead. In its report this week, the U.N. admitted to withholding the large number of civilian casualties it had recorded from diplomatic corps in the country. Though the United Nations says it made taciturn criticism of the government so that it could negotiate pauses in fighting to allow civilians to escape and for it to gain access to internally displaced people, the efforts were made in vain because, as Wednesday's report said, the U.N. was never in a position to reach those displaced people. The number of civilian deaths and injuries are unknown to this day, and U.N. figures greatly differ from those in reports from Sri Lanka's government and other nongovernmental organizations. ""The report concludes that the United Nations system failed to meet its responsibilities,"" United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement Thursday. The U.N. report concludes by stating: ""The UN's failure to adequately respond to events like those that occurred in Sri Lanka should not happen again. When confronted by similar situations, the UN must be able to meet a much higher standard in fulfilling its protection and humanitarian responsibilities."" However, Sumanthiran says there is more work to be done before moving on. ""That does not mean that it is a lesson for the future for the United Nations. The United Nations should revisit the events that took place during the final stages of the war in May 2009, where both the Tamil Tiger rebels and the security forces are accused of committing war crimes,"" he said. ""If the U.N. has made a mistake, they must pursue that course of action."" The Sri Lankan government had no immediate official response to the United Nations report. CNN's Iqbal Athas in Colombo, Sri Lanka, contributed to this report.","Sri Lanka's largest Tamil political party called for inquiry into U.N. failure to protect civilians during civil war .

"(CNN) -- Kenya's military controls half of the Somalian port city of Kismayo as it tries to drive out the al Qaeda-linked militant group Al-Shabaab from one of its last strongholds, a military spokesman said Saturday. Kenyan and Somali ground forces are in control of the northern part, which is the old city, after a day and a half of fighting, spokesman Cyrus Oguna told CNN. They are consolidating the areas they have gained before moving into the south, where the Islamic militant group is believed to be, he said. The military launched airstrikes against the group Saturday. ""Al-Shabaab has not been able to offer any resistance whatsoever to the ground forces since the ground forces landed there yesterday, and the whole of yesterday and the good part of today they have (suffered) heavy casualties,"" Oguna said. More: Mogadishu bombing kills Somali broadcaster . The Kenya Defense Forces inflicted ""massive destruction"" on Al-Shabaab's infrastructure Saturday, using jets and helicopter gunships to destroy three of the group's bases, according to the military's official Twitter account. ""Great care and caution has been exercised to avoid collateral damage,"" it said. But in a series of posts Saturday on a Twitter account often used by Al-Shabaab, the group said the Kenyan military is ""waging a losing battle"" in Kismayo. It said mujahedeen forces ambushed Kenyan troops 30 km (18 miles) west of Kismayo, destroying three vehicles and killing dozens of troops in a two-hour battle. Oguna said those reports are ""pure propaganda."" ""There has been no major ground forces engagement,"" he said. Kenya's military makes up the majority of troops in an African Union offensive to drive Al-Shabaab out of Somalia, where the group has long tried to overthrow the government. Al-Shabaab has suffered setbacks in the fight, including losing control of much of the capital, Mogadishu, last year. That made Kismayo even more critical for the group, which uses the port to profit from the illegal charcoal trade and smuggling operations. More: Soldiers killed in blast targeting Somali president . Thousands of civilians fled the city this month as fighting loomed, according to the U.N. refugee agency. It said that Somalis were leaving in minibuses, in trucks and on donkey carts. ""Great care and caution has been exercised to avoid collateral damage,"" the Kenyan military said Saturday. Since crossing into Somalia in October, Kenyan commanders and politicians have stated more than once that capturing Kismayo was the ultimate aim of their operation. The military's operation to take Kismayo began with airstrikes and naval gun support three days before the ground troops arrived, Oguna said. Twitter postings Friday from Kenya's prime minister and deputy prime minister congratulating the military on capturing Kismayo actually referred to the ground forces' arrival in the city, Oguna said.","The Kenyan military says it controls half of Kismayo .

"Alexandria, Virginia (CNN) -- A Moroccan man who admitted to a plot to bomb the U.S. Capitol was sentenced Friday to 30 years in prison. ""I just want to say that I love Allah. That's it,"" Amine El Khalifi said before his sentencing at U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia. El Khalifi, 29, agreed to plead guilty in June to attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction against government property. Prosecutors and defense lawyers agreed to a sentencing range of 25 to 30 years as part of a plea agreement. El Khalifi was arrested in an FBI sting last February after authorities said he donned a suicide vest and accepted an automatic weapon in a parking garage near the Capitol complex. The vest and the gun had been rendered inoperable by law enforcement. ""This case is the first suicide bomber in America,"" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Gordon Kromberg in arguing for the higher sentence to send a message. ""We cannot wait until there are real dead victims."" Kromberg also referred to the attack on Tuesday by armed militants on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans on the anniversary of the al Qaeda attacks of September 11, 2001. ""We just had an ambassador killed in Libya,"" said Kromberg. ""These things can't be tolerated."" El Khalifi's lawyer, Kenneth Troccoli, argued his client should get the lower range of the sentence. ""His motive was to do what he thought God had told him to do,"" Troccoli said. El Khalifi has no ill will toward Americans and was relieved his plot was thwarted and no one was injured, Troccoli said, adding that his client admitted culpability to a serious offense but was ""enabled"" in the plot by two men who he didn't know were working for the FBI. Lawyers: FBI agents promised payments to family of attempted bomber . Kromberg stressed at the sentencing hearing that El Khalifi was driving the plot and was not pushed into it by undercover officers. But Troccoli said the undercover agents offered to send martyrdom payments to El Khalifi's parents in Morocco and also paid off his debts. El Khalifi's religion would not allow him to give up his life while in debt or leave his family in financial trouble, Troccoli said. The attorney also described his client as a young man who came to the United States at 16 as a visitor and liked it so much he stayed. El Khalifi overstayed his visa and was in the country illegally at the time of his arrest. Troccoli said El Khalifi's main interest was in mixing music but that led him to a lifestyle that included spending time in night clubs and using drugs. At his mother's urging, El Khalifi became more religious and started regularly attending a mosque and reading the Quran, the attorney said. According toTroccoli, his client thought his religion required him to mount his attack but it didn't matter if it was successful. ""He has no desire to ever do this again,"" said Troccoli. But U.S. District Judge James Cacheris asked: ""What if God tells him to do this again when he gets out?"" Troccoli said El Khalifi believed he had ""satisfied his faith"" and also noted the plea agreement called for his client to be deported to Morroco after he serves his time. Cacheris nevertheless imposed the maximum sentence under the plea agreement. According to a statement of facts in the case, El Khalifi changed his mind about what to target and at various times considered a restaurant, a military installation and a synagogue. He eventually decided to try to blow himself up in the Capitol, according to the court document, and said ""he would be happy killing 30 people."" El Khalifi admitted performing surveillance at the Capitol and asking an associate, who was secretly part of the FBI sting, to remotely detonate the bomb if he ran into problems with security.","Moroccan man was arrested in sting and later pleaded guilty to bombing charges .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- It was a different Mitt Romney who arrived in Jerusalem at the weekend. The man who landed on the campaign flight from London was unusually circumspect, even for a candidate not noted for unbridled displays of exuberance and emotion. But if the Republican front-runner seemed wooden and tense as he stood beside his old friend and onetime professional colleague Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday, he had his reasons. The Israel whistle-stop of Romney's current three-nation tour may prove the most crucial to his chances of defeating Barack Obama in November. Republican strategists hope that the policy and press-the-flesh pilgrimage to Jerusalem would help Romney sway the hearts and votes of traditionally Democratic Jews in battleground states. After a rocky showing in a visit to England, as well as a flap over the scheduling of a fund-raising dinner in the shadow of one of Judaism's most solemn fast days, there was little margin here for error. More: 'Romneyshambles' after London Olympics gaffe . The visit has also served to illustrate the observation that at some point, all those who spend time in Jerusalem find themselves suspended between the 21st century and the 1st. When his trip was still in the planning stage, events that occurred thousands of years ago had a direct effect on the former governor's schedule, down to his plans for supper. ""Everything was already prepared,"" began Orly Azoulai, a Washington correspondent for Israel's mass-circulation Yediot Ahronot newspaper, opening a featured magazine spread on the eve of the visit with an account of the fund-raising dinner originally set for Sunday evening. ""The guest list was glamorous and elite, the menu abundant, the tickets a minimum of $50,000, all proceeds to go to the Romney campaign,"" she wrote. ""Only then were the organizers reminded of one small detail -- the dinner was scheduled for Sunday, the Ninth of the (Jewish) month of Av (a fast day marking the anniversary of the destruction of the ancient Holy Temples of Jerusalem) -- so that the wealthy Jewish donors would not be able to participate at all."" Campaign staffers, stung by criticism that they had paid little heed to Jewish sensibilities, maintained that the dinner would, in any case, have taken place after the fast had ended. Taking no chances, however, they moved the meal to a Monday-morning breakfast just before Romney was to leave for a final travel stop in Poland, and took the unusual step of closing the fund-raiser to the press before ultimately reversing course and allowing some reporters to cover his remarks. More: Romney raises more than $1 million in Jerusalem . If, mindful of the British media frenzy sparked by Romney's having called preparations for the Olympics ""disconcerting,"" Romney campaign officials sought to lower the profile of the Israel visit, their wish has been granted. Even in Israel Hayom, the mass circulation daily newspaper owned by U.S. billionaire and major Romney donor Sheldon Adelson, a guest at the Jerusalem fundraiser -- the candidate's arrival in Israel was placed on the Sunday paper's page nine. It appeared alongside a report on Barack Obama, one day before the Romney visit, announcing a $70 million allocation for Israeli rocket defense systems and signing a measure to bolster U.S.-Israel security ties. Nor has the visit stirred a public inured to all but the most apocalyptic of events. At week's end, in the open market of Machaneh Yehuda, downtown Jerusalem's fragrant, teeming buffet of produce and political ferment, neither Romney nor Obama seemed to generate much in the way of affinity or even interest. ""To tell you the truth, neither of them is to my taste,"" said shopper Avichai Edri, 48, sifting through a bin for the perfect eggplant. By contrast to the current candidates, Edri said, presidents Bill Clinton and George Bush communicated genuine concern and warmth to Israelis. In the end, he said, ""It doesn't really matter who wins in November. I believe that Americans, the American people, will come through for us whenever we are in trouble, and the president will, too. Whoever he is."" More: Romney says Jerusalem is Israel's capital . Even some of those who side with Romney politically are decidedly qualified in their endorsements. ""Among all the sectors of the (American) population which I'm not fond of, I may be least fond of the Republicans,"" said Avri Gilad, a television and radio host, during his show on Israel Army Radio before Romney arrived. ""Regrettably, though, the Republicans, with all their fouled up personal dealings, view the (world and regional) situation more accurately than do the Democrats, who are much more personable, likable people."" He would much rather choose Obama as a partner for dinner conversation or a trip to the Galapagos Islands, Gilad told his Israel Army Radio audience. But as a president, ""even Mitt Romney the Ridiculous, this cartoon of an American, is preferable to the Obama the Terrific.""","Romney visited Israel as part of three country tour that also includes Britain and Poland .

"(CNN) -- Former Sen. Tom Daschle has withdrawn his nomination to head the Department of Health and Human Services, according to a statement Tuesday from the White House. Former Sen. Tom Daschle apologized for making mistakes on his tax records. Daschle had been fighting to save his nomination after controversy over his tax records and questions over his work in a field that some consider lobbying. In a statement announcing his withdrawal, Daschle said it was an honor to be chosen to lead the reform of America's health care system. ""But if 30 years of exposure to the challenges inherent in our system has taught me anything, it has taught me that this work will require a leader who can operate with the full faith of Congress and the American people, and without distraction,"" he said. ""Right now, I am not that leader, and will not be a distraction. The focus of Congress should be on the urgent business of moving the president's economic agenda forward, including affordable health care for every American.""  Watch what the administration loses with Daschle's withdrawal » . The Obama administration had stood by his side, and fellow Democrats lined up behind him, but Daschle's problems, coupled with other nominees' issues, gave critics ammunition to question President Obama's call for a ""new era of responsibility."" The president said Tuesday he accepts Daschle's decision ""with sadness and regret."" ""Tom made a mistake, which he has openly acknowledged. He has not excused it, nor do I. But that mistake, and this decision, cannot diminish the many contributions Tom has made to this country, from his years in the military to his decades of public service. Now we must move forward, with our plan to lift this economy and put people back to work,""  Obama said in a statement. However, in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper later Tuesday, Obama said he made a mistake in handling the nomination of Daschle. ""I think I screwed up. And, I take responsibility for it and we're going to make sure we fix it so it doesn't happen again. ""Ultimately, I campaigned on changing Washington and bottom-up politics,"" Obama said. ""And I don't want to send a message to the American people that there are two sets of standards -- one for powerful people and one for ordinary folks who are working every day and paying their taxes."" Daschle's resignation came hours after Nancy Killefer's withdrawal as Obama's chief performance officer, a new post in the administration.  View past Cabinet nominees who withdrew » . Officials said privately the reason for Killefer's withdrawal was unspecified tax issues. The much-touted post was designed to scrub the federal budget. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on Obama's cabinet choices . Daschle, the former Senate majority leader, apologized Monday for failing to pay his taxes in full. He said earlier he was ""deeply embarrassed"" for a series of errors that included failing to report $15,000 in charitable donations, unreported car service and more than $80,000 in unreported income from consulting. Daschle recently filed amended tax returns and paid more than $140,000 in back taxes and interest for 2005-2007. A New York Times editorial on Tuesday called for Daschle to withdraw. The paper's editorial board particularly took issue with Daschle saying he identified the unpaid taxes in June but did not pay them until his nomination for the top post at the Department of Health and Human Services. The editorial also criticized Daschle for generating a sizable income from health-related industries while working in the private sector.  Watch how Daschle's consulting work also caused some concern » . ""Mr. Daschle is another in a long line of politicians who move cozily between government and industry. We don't know that his industry ties would influence his judgments on health issues, but they could potentially throw a cloud over health care reform,"" the editorial said. Shortly after news of the tax quandary broke, a number of Democratic senators released statements expressing their support for Daschle, including Sens. John Kerry of Massachusetts, Charles Schumer of New York, Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts. In their opinions, Daschle identified the problem and corrected it. Daschle's supporters said that given his record of three decades of public service, he was still the right man for the job. ""One cannot underestimate how widely admired Tom Daschle is in Washington for his integrity, for his public service. And many, many Democrats look to him as one of the favorite people. He's got a lot of support in this White House, starting with the president,"" said David Gergen, a senior political analyst for CNN. Obama and Daschle have a longstanding relationship. Daschle endorsed Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination in February 2007 -- nearly 11 months before the first contest. Daschle was also considered to be a contender for Obama's No. 2 spot. Daschle also has a history with members of Congress. He represented South Dakota in the House of Representatives for four terms, and he served in the Senate for three terms. He was the Senate majority leader from June 2001 to January 2003, and was the minority leader before losing his re-election bid in 2004. Daschle's work in his post-Senate years was also a point of contention on his path to confirmation. After leaving the Senate, Daschle went on to serve as a special public policy adviser at the law firm Alston & Bird. According to the firm's Web site, Daschle advised clients on ""issues related to financial services, health care, energy, telecommunications and taxes."" His work, for which he reportedly made millions, seemed to contradict Obama's strict rules on lobbyists working in his administration. Promising ""a new era of openness in our country,"" Obama signed executive orders relating to ethics guidelines for staff members as one of his first acts in office. ""If you are a lobbyist entering my administration, you will not be able to work on matters you lobbied on, or in the agencies you lobbied during the previous two years,"" the president said. The administration had defended its choice of Daschle, pointing out that he was not technically a lobbyist. ""If you're not registered to lobby, you can't be a lobbyist,"" said White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, according to Time.com. Time.com: When is a lobbyist not a lobbyist? Daschle and Kellifer were not the first of Obama's nominees to come under scrutiny. Before Tim Geithner was confirmed as treasury secretary, he was questioned over concerns involving his personal taxes and the immigration status of a former housekeeper. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson also withdrew his nomination to be commerce secretary, citing the distraction of a federal investigation into ties to a company that has done business with his state. Given Obama's pledge for ""unprecedented transparency, rigorous oversight and clear accountability,"" some said the controversy surrounding Obama's appointments are calling into question the president's vetting process. ""Mr. President, your picks to help run the federal government don't have to be perfect, but is it too much to ask that they pay like everyone else, to keep that same government functioning? And more importantly, that they don't wait until everyone, including you, is watching?"" CNN's Campbell Brown wrote in a commentary. Read the commentary . Asked if the president is embarrassed by the slew of appointment problems, Gibbs was quick to negate that idea. ""No, I don't think that -- that we believe there's any problem in the vetting,"" Gibbs said Monday.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A top Taliban commander has issued a new threat to foreign aid workers, saying that under the insurgent group's new ""constitution"" they will execute them as spies or hold them in exchange for the release of Taliban fighters. Taliban militants pose with their weapons as they drive their car in Wardak province. (File photo) In an exclusive telephone interview Friday night with CNN, Mohammed Ibrahim Hanafi said the Taliban intelligence wing was actively gathering information on foreign aid workers. ""If we get someone, that is how we will deal with it under our new constitution,"" he said. He added that he was telling ""Afghan brothers not to work with NGOs."" In the 15-minute interview, arranged by an intermediary for CNN, Hanafi repeated the Taliban's pledge to keep girls out of public schools. ""Our law is still the same old law which was in place during our rule in Afghanistan,"" he said. ""Mullah Mohammad Omar was our leader and he is still our head and leader and so we will follow the same law as before."" ""In my opinion,"" he added, ""Taliban aren't allowing girls to go to schools because Taliban want women to preserve their respect by staying in their homes, not to work as laborers for others."" Dozens of crimes across the country, especially acid attacks, have marred the opening of the new school year in Afghanistan. Afghan girls have been burned and scared randomly with acid as punishment for going to school. More than 600 schools did not open this year because of security issues, according to the Afghanistan Education Ministry.  Watch what females face in Afghanistan » . The schools that did open, however, remain defiant. Young women admitted to CNN being fearful but also said they are determined to get an education and better their lives. It is a sentiment echoed by their principal, a 35-year veteran of Afghanistan's girls schools. ""I am asking those who close schools and throw acid on girls to let the children of this country go to school because it's crime to close the schools, a crime against the children of this country,"" said Safia Hayat, principal of the Zarghona Girls School in Kabul. Hanafi, meanwhile, went on to discuss possible reconciliation talks with the Afghan government. ""I don't think there can be any discussion of peace until the the foreigners leave Afghanistan,"" he said referring to the presence of coalition troops. While he seemed to confirm that some reconciliation talks were ongoing, Hanafi also said he wondered what kind of peace was possible as long as Afghans are still dying in NATO bombardments. Hanafi described himself as a commander in the southern province of Helmand, but announced a new Taliban offensive in the north was about to begin and that he would be playing a key role there.","Top Taliban commander issues threat to execute foreign aid workers .

"London (CNN) -- Spain's Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, may not seem a natural performer but he appears all too familiar with the waltz; a typically slow dance, usually partnered, often mournful, with little room for improvement. As his country faces the prospect of a bailout, Rajoy's gentle glides may mark him as a natural on the political dance floor. But to others, his moves are far too predictable. In recent weeks, Rajoy has measured his steps carefully. He has been balancing political tactics with the need to stabilize the economy. He wants to avoid the fate of Greece, Ireland and Portugal, which have been left at the mercy of foreign creditors. Gliding sideways . But his steps are being read like an open book. Spaniards no longer believe he can keep up the tempo. Media speculation is centered on a European Union summit on October 18 and 19, and the potential for Rajoy to seek a bailout at that time. But this gloomy conservative has built a career on digging in his heels, and some suggest Rajoy will wait until after regional elections in the Basque country and in his home state of Galicia on October 21 before asking for any help. It's all tactics of course. By withholding unpopular news until after the election, Rajoy may have a better chance of winning a full majority in the local parliament. But playing politics with the budget may not be a good idea. Rajoy delayed announcing the 2012 budget in March until after a regional ballot in Andalucia -- the Spanish region with the highest unemployment in the country at 32.8% -- but the move did not pay off. His center-right party, Partido Popular, failed to oust the Socialists. In harmony with the partner . Rajoy's political moves have, to a certain extent, been in harmony with the European Central Bank. The ECB this month outlined its plan to save the euro by offering to make unlimited purchases of short-term government bonds. The announcement eased pressure on Spain -- and Rajoy -- and the country's borrowing costs fell. Last week, Rajoy had yet another reason to continue his slow dance. The Spanish Treasury sold $6.3 billion of three-year and 10-year government bonds, more that it had planned. But, despite the optimism, some suggest Rajoy should request aid now, when market conditions are more favorable. Delays in acknowledging Spain needs a support package may be more costly for it in the long run. According to Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, there's a ""surreal air"" to Spanish debt auctions. Spiro, in a note, wrote the bond sales are well received because investors are pricing in an eventual request from Madrid for an ECB-backed bond-buying program. Staying steady . Rajoy has often said he sees little point in asking for aid. This month, in his first TV interview since being elected, he said he will not accept outside conditions over a possible bailout. Speaking to Spain's national broadcaster TVE, Rajoy said: ""We have to study any conditions imposed on the bailout package and then we will see. But of course, I would not like it if they told us where we had to cut or where not."" Spaniards taking to the streets in protest don't care about the politics as long as they can get a job, pay their mortgage and eat. Only a week ago, tens of thousands of demonstrators from across Spain took to the streets of Madrid in a large anti-austerity protest. The last dance? Meanwhile, on the streets of Barcelona, Rajoy faces a domestic challenge that could make seeking a bailout even more complicated. Last week, Rajoy rejected Catalonia's demand for greater economic independence. As the most economically powerful region, Catalonia argues it can do without Madrid. Madrid disagrees. Fears of separatism are so acute that Spain's King Juan Carlos -- in an unusual move -- has spoken out. The king released an open letter on the Royal Palace's website calling for national unity and lamenting the country's economic pain. ""The worst thing we can do is to divide our forces, encourage dissension, chase illusions, deepen wounds,"" the king wrote. Many believe Rajoy will continue his slow dance despite the political discord. But it seems, no matter the delays, Spain is slowly stepping toward a bailout. As such, this could be Rajoy's last political dance.","Spain's Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, may not seem a natural performer but he appears all too familiar with the waltz .

"(CNN) -- While we don't yet know the full scope of damages inflicted by superstorm Sandy, it is clear recovery costs in the New York region will be in the billions of dollars. According to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, recovery after Sandy will be ""if not the most extensive and expensive, one of the most in our nation's history."" But despite the staggering losses, the region has everything going for it to recover quickly. Disasters happen all over the world, but their impacts vary greatly, driven by the interplay between the natural environment, economic and social forces, and institutions in each country. The 2010 Haitian earthquake was devastating, killing more than 300,000 people. Haiti is the poorest nation in the Western hemisphere; resources for construction are limited and building codes absent. Recovery has been extremely slow: Six months after the quake, about 98% of the debris remained, making much of capital city Port-au-Prince impassable. Even two years later, up to 500,000 people were still homeless. Compared with the death toll of 300,000 in Haiti, the 1995 earthquake of nearly equal magnitude in Kobe, Japan, killed just 6,434 people. The recovery in this highly developed city was incredibly fast. Many experts in Japan predicted that it might take up to 10 years for Kobe to rebuild and for its economy to fully recover. To the surprise of many, in less than 15 months, manufacturing in greater Kobe was 98% of its pre-earthquake trend. The rubble had been removed within just two years of the quake. While wealth is critical in protecting life and capital, other factors are also important: Well-developed insurance markets, trade openness that speeds the flow of emergency resources, and effective management in preparing and responding to disasters are also critical. The government must be effective in allocating resources and conducting recovery operations. Research shows that countries with greater local government autonomy are far more effective at protecting people in natural disasters than more centralized government systems because local authorities more familiar with local needs can respond quickly and effectively. George Horwich, who studied the Kobe earthquake, says human capability and the country's cultural attributes are the most essential elements to quick recovery; while individuals' skills are very important, the relationships between people and the ability to work together are essential to community recovery and resiliency. Horwich says: ""Destroy any amount of physical capital, but leave behind a critical number of knowledgeable human beings whose brains still house the culture and technology of a dynamic economy, and the physical capital will tend to re-emerge almost spontaneously. ""Capital accumulation is especially easy the second time around because the primary goal is to duplicate an investment pattern, not design it from scratch.. Hiroshima, in which the bomb took a much larger fraction of both human and physical capital, was a bustling commercial metropolis just five years later. The German city of Aachen, reduced to rubble in World War II, did not even bother to remove the debris for some years. Instead, it moved major sections of the city and was booming again in the early 1950s."" Although Hiroshima lost many people, those who remained still possessed the essential elements needed to stage a recovery. Of course, the economy suffers in the periods immediately after a disaster. In the New York region, flood damages, limited transportation and power outages will continue to hold down productivity. But as money from insurance, savings and government begins to flow into the region, economic activity will rebound. This is not to say people will necessarily be better off, but they could be in time. Despite the damages and destruction, there may yet be a silver lining. When building and infrastructure are destroyed, superior materials and technology are often used in reconstruction. This can improve productivity in the long run. People who live in disaster-prone regions tend to invest more in education, an important driver of economic growth. Disasters also motivate people who might not normally interact with one another to work together to resolve challenges. Recent research shows how societal trust increases after disasters. After Hurricane Katrina, city leaders in New Orleans who had disagreed on how to fix the troubled New Orleans school system came together and agreed to replace it with a new structure. Two-thirds of city schools in 2004 were rated ""academically unacceptable"" by the state. By 2010, only 4 in 10 were rated that way, and the percentage of students attending a low-performing school had been cut in half. The New York region has as all the essential elements required for a quick recovery: one of the most highly educated populations in the world, relatively nimble and autonomous state and local governments, highly developed insurance markets, and excellent infrastructure and trade linkAGES to speed the inflow of resources. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Skidmore .","Mark Skidmore: Disaster's impact depends on where the devastation occured .

"(CNN) -- So it looks like President Obama got the message. In his second debate with Mitt Romney, the president delivered a comeback performance that will stand as a model for future debaters of how to right a listing ship. Obama was as good in Hempstead as he was bad in Denver. In fact, this may have been the finest debate of his career and just at the moment when he needed it most. CNN Poll: Nearly half say Obama won showdown . Navigating the tricky shoals of the town hall format, the president laid out a persuasive case for re-election, point by point, drawing sharp contrasts with his opponent while avoiding rudeness. Obama's arguments were not always as succinctly stated as they needed to be, and he too often strayed far from the topic at hand. But by the end of the debate, he had checked off pretty much every item on his list of ""Things I Should Have Done in Denver."" It was Obama the community organizer who showed up, a man with a message to sell and an audience to sell it to. His interaction with the participants was confident, engaged and energetic, all the qualities he had failed to muster in Round 1. He appeared to draw strength from the 82 citizens on the stage, strength that grew as the evening progressed. At times Romney seemed taken aback by this fresh incarnation of the debater he had bested two weeks ago. Both substantively and stylistically, Romney operated in Obama's shadow in this match, second banana to the president's leading man. Clearly this was not the role Romney intended to play. Romney's defining moments were too frequently negative. His attempts to directly confront the president carried plenty of dramatic charge, but they didn't quite play out the way they must have in rehearsal. These maneuvers left an impression more of petulance than leadership. 'Binders full of women' raises brows . The thing that really gets Romney exercised in these debates is when he thinks he's not getting his due, which means he wastes far too much time demanding another minute or the final say or a chance to go back to something from a previous answer. Romney may believe this assertiveness makes him look strong and in command. More likely it reinforces a negative perception that the candidate needs to dispel: that of a plutocrat grabbing every last crumb he thinks he deserves. The town hall debate was a particularly inappropriate setting for Romney to display this side of himself. Romney's chief problem was that he did not connect to the audience as effectively as Obama did. This became apparent every time Romney began a response with ""I appreciate that"" or ""that's an important question,"" words that signaled his discomfort with many of the topics the voters wanted to discuss, like equal pay for women, banning assault weapons or immigration. Obama's big moments were more positive, especially, and unexpectedly, on the topic of Libya. Staring daggers at his opponent, the president said it was ""offensive"" for Romney to suggest that the White House had sought political gain from the murder of an American ambassador and three others. When moderator Candy Crowley backed up Obama's version of events over Romney's, the president got off one of the few funny lines of the night: ""Could you say that a little louder?"" Opinion: Obama bounces back, dominates debate . Obama also delivered a clever rejoinder in a back-and-forth about the candidates' personal finances. After the president brought up his rival's overseas investments, Romney cited Obama's own holdings: ""Have you looked at your pension?"" ""It's not as big as yours,"" came the answer, ""so I don't look at it that often."" Advantage, Obama. One of Romney's lowest points came when a woman in the audience asked him to differentiate between himself and former President George W. Bush. The governor's response might have been written by the staff of ""Saturday Night Live:"" ""President Bush and I are different people and these are different times,"" he said. ""That's why my five-point plan is so different from what he would have done."" Not exactly a sound bite for the ages. Before this debate, I wondered whether Obama would acknowledge the elephant in the room: his shoddy performance in Round 1. Would he make a joke about it, or tell a cute story about what Michelle had said that night? Turns out he didn't need to. Obama's performance spoke for itself. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alan Schroeder.","Alan Schroeder: President Obama delivered a comeback performance in second debate .

"(CNN) -- The Syrian government has told the parents of a missing American journalist that it doesn't know where their son is, the man's father said Monday at a news conference in Beirut, Lebanon. Austin Tice last contacted his family on August 13 while in Syria reporting on the uprising there against the government of President Bashar al-Assad. He was reportedly preparing to leave Syria for Lebanon when he went missing, according to his family. Read more: Family working for journalist's release plans visit to Lebanon . In October, a shaky video surfaced on YouTube showing a man believed to be Tice surrounded by armed men walking him up a hill. Tice's father, Marc Tice, said that family members have been in touch, ""directly and indirectly,"" with Syrian government officials, but they have learned nothing about his son's location despite traveling to Beirut to seek his release. ""We're reaching out to everyone that we can get in touch with,"" he said. Tice's parents say they are willing to go to Syria if that what it will take to get their son back. ""We have no idea what will be required, and we would like to know from whoever is holding him what it is that we need to do,"" Marc Tice said. Austin is the oldest of the couple's seven children. ""We are a big, close family. We have all felt the void [of] his absence,"" said his mother, Debra Tice. With the holiday season approaching, they are ""dismayed by the empty chair at our family table,"" she said. ""We miss Austin. Knowing his smile, big laugh, great storytelling."" ""We ask whomever is holding Austin to treat him well, to keep him safe and return him to us as soon as possible,"" Marc Tice said. ""Again, anyone that hears this, anyone that can help us find Austin, talk with him and get him back safely, please send us an e-mail."" The e-mail address is information@austintice.com. U.S. State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland said Thursday that U.S. officials have no idea where Tice is but have enlisted the help of Poland, which represents U.S. interests in Syria as a ""protecting power"" after the closing of the American Embassy in Damascus.

Tice had smuggled himself into the country to report on the uprising. State Department officials have questioned the veracity of the October video, which purports to show Tice in the custody of rebels fighting the Syrian government.

"Maharashtra, India (CNN) -- Sister Shakila Shaikh works round the clock. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. She says she only takes one day off each year during the Muslim festival of Ramzan. ""I have to be here,"" she says, showing us her modest two-room health clinic in India. ""The women of this village need me."" Nurse Shaikh is part of a community of health workers leading the battle against malnutrition in Ahmednagar, a poor district in the western state of Maharashtra. Back in 2006, Maharashtra fared poorly in the Indian government's National Family Health Survey. The India-wide report showed that 40% of Maharashtra's children were underweight, an indication of general malnutrition. ""Data speaks,"" says Rajalakshmi Nair, Health and Nutrition specialist at UNICEF. She says it's a shame that a country that has grown economically has made very little progress when it comes to looking after its children. Despite two decades of robust economic growth, levels of malnutrition in India remain alarmingly high. According to the 2011 Hunger and Malnutrition survey conducted by the Nandi foundation, 42% of Indian children under the age of five are underweight. That's more than Sub-Saharan Africa. The Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh says it is a ""matter of national shame."" Vandana Krishna heads the Nutrition Mission of Maharashtra. She agrees that levels of malnutrition across India are very worrying but firmly believes the small steps being taken in the region will make a big difference. Following the 2006 report, the Maharashtra state government teamed up with UNICEF to launch a new initiative that focuses on the first 1,000 days of a child's life -- starting in the womb. Krishna says this is the period when children are most vulnerable. But she adds, ""It's also the window of opportunity. If you catch them at that age and address malnutrition and give them the right nutrition, the right childcare, some love and attention, then we can tackle this issue."" That's exactly what a team of health workers is trying to do across Maharashtra. Nurses like Sister Shaikh handle the early days. At her clinic, Sister Shaikh regularly holds counseling sessions during which she tells pregnant women what to eat and how to experience a healthy pregnancy. Many of the women who come to her clinic are poor and illiterate. They used to have lots of misconceptions about pregnancy, says Sister Shaikh. For example, they would not take any vitamins because they would worry that pills would make the baby too big, leading to a difficult childbirth. ""I started telling them, take your vitamins and folic acid tablets. Don't worry. Your body knows its limit. The baby will grow accordingly."" She tells us she's delivered 96 babies since April this year. All of them were above 2.5 kilograms. Not a single one was underweight. Sister Shaikh continues counseling women for a few months after they give birth -- then, a team of anganwadi workers takes over. Anganwadi means courtyard in Hindi. Typically, a government-run anganwadi will provide children with a range of facilities -- pre-school, counseling, basic health care and meals -- around a central courtyard. The anganwadis are playing a crucial role in fighting malnutrition in Maharashtra. At the center we visit, anganwadi workers check the height and weight of children twice a week and are constantly on the lookout for children who are stunted or underweight. ""My main goal is to keep the children healthy, both mentally and physically,"" says Hemlata Babasaheb Bagul who has been an anganwadi worker for 10 years. One of the 24 children she looks after is moderately underweight. At two years and 11 months, Bagul tells us Sai should weigh 12 kilograms. She weighs 10.3 kilograms. So Bagul has got Sai's mother involved. She's told her what to feed the child and when to give her meals. She's also advised her to stock a low shelf with nutritious snacks such as peanut balls to that Sai can help herself whenever she's hungry. Timely intervention likes this appears to be making a difference in Maharashtra. Krishna says she's awaiting results of a state-wide survey on nutrition levels but tells CNN that early data shows malnutrition in children has halved in Maharashtra since 2006. The key, she says is to focus on the first 1,000 days of a child's life -- and to find a few local heroes like Sister Shaikh.","2006 report showed that 40% of Maharashtra state's children were underweight .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- As President Barack Obama prepares to visit Myanmar next week, a nonprofit group warned violence between Buddhists and Muslims in the west of the country could destabilize the nation just as it is emerging from decades of military repression. Obama is set to become the first sitting U.S. president to visit Myanmar, providing a powerful endorsement of the Southeast Asian nation's efforts to move toward greater democracy under President Thein Sein. But his arrival follows months of turmoil in the western state of Rakhine, where tensions between the majority Buddhist community and the Rohingya, a stateless ethnic Muslim group, boiled over into clashes that have killed scores of people and left tens of thousands of others living in makeshift camps. Read more: What a difference a year makes in Myanmar . The Rohingya, most of whom don't have Myanmar citizenship, appear to have born the brunt of the violence. The situation has ominous signs for Myanmar and its complex ethnic makeup, according to the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit organization that provides analysis and advocacy on conflicts around the world. ""The ongoing intercommunal strife in Rakhine State is of grave concern,"" the group said in a report released Monday. ""And there is the potential for similar violence elsewhere, as nationalism and ethno-nationalism rise and old prejudices resurface."" The bloodshed and upheaval of recent months have left the Buddhist and Rohingya communities in Rakhine ""essentially segregated,"" the report said. A failure by authorities to address the deepening divisions between the communities could result in a resumption of violence in the future, the report argues, ""which would be to the detriment of both communities, and of the country as a whole."" Read more: Q&A: What's behind sectarian violence in Myanmar? Citing government figures, the United Nations says at least 89 people have been killed in violence in Rakhine in recent weeks and 110,000 people are now displaced. The deaths come on top of dozens of others during clashes in May and June. Some Rohingya have tried to flee into neighboring Bangladesh, but many have been blocked at the border. Bangladeshi authorities say that the more than 200,000 Rohingya refugees already in the country are as many as they can deal with. The risk for Myanmar authorities, according to the International Crisis Group report, is that the unrest in Rakhine could spread to other parts of the country. ""All the large cities have significant Muslim minorities,"" the report says.

"(CNN) -- Talks aimed at ending 50 years of fighting between FARC guerrillas and Colombian forces are expected to take place Wednesday in Norway. In an interview last month, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that he was hopeful about the prospect for peace.

Peace talks between the rebels -- the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC -- and the government have occurred sporadically since the 1980s. The last attempt fell apart in 2002. Then-President Andres Pastrana ceded an area the size of Switzerland to the guerrilla group but ended negotiations after rebels launched a series of attacks across the country in an apparent bid to strengthen their position. The two sides have been at war since the 1960s, making it Latin America's oldest insurgency. Santos said the group must be permitted to participate in the political process.

""And if I see that there's no progress, that they are simply trying to buy time, I will stand up and continue business as usual.

"(CNN) -- Back in 1950, the European Reconstruction Program organized a contest for posters promoting the U.S. Marshall Plan. Among over 10,000 entries, the winner was Reijn Dirksen, then barely 25 years old. His entry portrayed a ship braving stormy waters and a dark fog, pulled forward by multiple sails: the Continent's flags. The hull of the ship was made of letters spelling ""Europe"" and the caption read, ""All our colours to the mast."" Early on Friday, the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo did something unusual: Instead of rewarding the Nobel Peace Prize to an individual, it gave it to the European Union -- an international institution facing a 3-year-old existential crisis that looks nowhere close to being over. Almost immediately, critics pointed out the odd choice, mocking the award to an agglomeration of countries, many of which are in recession and internal turmoil. In the last two years, many a respectable economist has argued the end was nigh for Europe's single currency, as well as the EU at large. The Union has been likened to the League of Nations and a fascistic government due to its perceived ""democratic deficit,"" the indictment that current supranational institutions do not answer to electorates directly enough. It's safe to assume no comparison featuring the League of Nations is a happy one. But such criticism is gravely misplaced. The Nobel communique does not begin to describe what the EU has done for Europe, but history can. In the century between 1848 and 1945, the Continent lived in constant crisis. Nationalisms emerged, empires crumbled, and conflagration became the rule. Thrice did Germany and France go to war with each other, and twice they dragged the whole world with them. One of those world wars involved an unspeakable genocide conducted at industrial scale by a developed nation. In its aftermath, as Churchill warned, ""an iron curtain descended across the Continent,"" and whole nations lived in the misery and rubble left behind by aerial bombing. Opinion: Nobel Peace Prize a wasted opportunity . Along with demography and economics, ideas have the power to drive history. Like British-sponsored free trade in the 19th century and revolutionary Marxism in the early 20th, European integration caught on. A year after Dirksen finished his poster, the ship of Europe began to be built in earnest through the Treaty of Paris, which effectively tied the economies of France and West Germany together. By 1956, the Soviet Union proved itself no better than the devils it had once fought when it violently crushed the Hungarian Revolution. In stark contrast, a year later six Western European nations signed the Treaty of Rome, pledging ""ever closer union"" and giving birth to the European Economic Community, which has since evolved into the EU. For countries long mired in internal divisions, Europe became a shining light. A remarkably peaceful transition in Spain followed three decades of iron-fisted dictatorship by Francisco Franco, brought about by a devastating civil war. In a country where philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset had once written that ""Spain is the problem and Europe the solution,"" the promise of integration underwrote Spain's first-ever successful experiment with democracy. Similarly, authoritarian regimes in Portugal and Greece gave way to pro-European republics respectful of human rights. And when the Berlin Wall finally fell, what former Soviet subjects wanted turned out to be not so different. They sought the freedoms and opportunities that the EU embodies. The process of integration -- along with the work of organizations like the Open Society Institutes -- contributed to a strengthening of democratic institutions in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovenia. No lasting dictatorial strongmen emerged, forcing many political scientists to revise their overly deterministic models. Just compare the post-Soviet fate of dictatorial Belarus with that of democratic Poland. With all its imperfections, Europe today is the largest single market in the world, featuring effective anti-trust regulations, curtailing economic nationalism, and promoting free trade agreements with counties as far away as Asia and Latin America. New potential members are eager to join, from booming Turkey to crisis-ridden Iceland. Despite all the talk of stalling, Turkish membership will eventually come to pass. True enough, the sovereign debt crisis has revealed flaws in the design of the monetary union. And the democratic deficit must be addressed through directly elected EU officers. But Europe is far more likely to emerge strengthened from the ordeal than apart. It's not just European institutions like the central bank and the Commission that speak of ""more Europe"" as the solution. So do national leaders like the French president and the Italian prime minister. The disagreement is not so much about the federalist future, but about how to get there. That is why even the careful German chancellor speaks of Europe as a ""Schicksalsgemeinschaft"" -- a ""community of destiny."" Indeed, looking at the research from this year's Nobel Memorial Prize winner in economics, Tom Sargent, Europe does not compare badly with the early United States, which took a decade to transition from the Articles of Confederation to the Constitution. The success of Dirksen's ship ""Europe"" is ultimately twofold. Within its members and potential members, it has made the word ""dictator"" into an anachronism, a seemingly impossible feat from the perspective of 1945, not to mention 1848. And beyond the Continent, it has proven that post-national integration is not only possible, but also desirable. The individual colors on the mast are still there -- but they all sail together. The Americas -- where the founding fathers in both Northern and Southern republics once dreamt of integration -- should take note. Perhaps one day the Nobel Peace Prize will reward that project. In the meantime, Europe sails on. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pierpaolo Barbieri.","Pierpaolo Barbieri: Nobel Peace Prize awarded to European Union stirred controversy .

"(CNN) -- The cowards who aimed to silence 14-year-old Malala Yousufzai with a bullet have instead made the Pakistani schoolgirl a global icon. Even as she remains in a hospital bed, her advocacy for the millions of girls worldwide who are denied an education sounds beyond the borders of Pakistan. Malala has reminded us all that the real dream for these girls is simple: They want an education. But she is also a symbol of how far we are from making that dream a reality. Seven years ago, I traveled to an area not far from Malala's home in Mingora. A massive earthquake had destroyed 80% of the town of Balakot, and I was on site with UNICEF, working to salvage some normalcy for thousands of traumatized and injured children. The work was gratifying beyond words, as we brought warm coats and blankets to children who had lost everything. But the real joy of the trip was watching hundreds of girls attend school for their very first time. UNICEF specializes at finding opportunity in crisis, and this was no exception: Parents needed safe shelter for their children as they went about the business of rebuilding their homes and lives, so UNICEF-supported schools met a community need -- and fathers who had never allowed their daughters to be educated agreed to let them attend. Enrollment skyrocketed. Most of UNICEF's ""schools"" were open air, under trees or outside of tents. Eager students sat cross-legged on the cold dirt. Some of the girls were hesitant; others boldly pushed boys aside to ensure they were sitting as close to the teacher as possible. One 8-year-old leapt up to the makeshift blackboard and with great dramatic flair, pretended to lead the class. Oh, the shrieks of delight her cheekiness elicited from astonished classmates! Suddenly, girls were equal to boys! Over the last seven years, UNICEF-assisted districts in Pakistan have enrolled more than half a million girls as first-time students â€” including 21,000 in earthquake-affected regions. But inequalities remain. In Pakistan, the government spends less than 2.5% of its GDP on the education sector, and only half of the 19 million children of primary school age are in school. About 58% of boys are enrolled in primary school compared to 48% of girls. But those numbers don't reflect the real depth of gender inequity. In areas like the Swat Valley, where Malala lives, the percentage of girls in school is far lower -- and overall, well under half of Pakistani women are literate. The percentage of female literacy is as low as 7% in some rural areas. Conflict, poverty, school fees and child labor create barriers to education for all children, but girls often face additional obstacles related to their gender and role in society. Some are expected to work in the home, supporting the family, others expected to marry and have children at a very young age. Some live in communities where girls are not perceived as equal to boys, or deserving of the same rights. And even as the global gender gap for primary school enrollment has been narrowed, there's been little progress for adolescent girls: An estimated 31 million are not in school in South Asia. As a consequence of this gender discrimination, an estimated two-thirds of the world's illiterate adults are women. The failure to educate girls has far-reaching consequences: A girl who is educated is more likely to educate her own children, and her ability to protect her children because of her knowledge will improve her family's prospects through the generations. Educating girls is one of the most effective tools for improving economies and raising productivity in developing countries. According to some estimates, about half of the drop in under-5 child mortality over the last 40 years can be attributed to increases in women's education. In my dozen years with UNICEF, I've met thousands of children in some of the world's most challenging circumstances. When I ask them what they wish for, without hesitation they respond, ""an education."" If we want to stand with Malala, we need to raise our voices, too. All the world's children have equal value and potential. It's up to us to be sure they are provided the opportunities they deserve.","Szarkowski: Malala Yousufzai has become a global icon for gender equity in education .

"(CNN) -- Five Royal Marines have been charged with murder for the death of a man in Afghanistan's Helmand province last year, authorities said Sunday. In all, authorities arrested nine Marines in connection with the death, but four were later released without charge, the British defense ministry said. The men were part of Operation Herrick 14, as Britain's efforts in Afghanistan are known. Their case will now proceed through a military court system that mirrors the civilian legal system. In its announcements of the arrests, and later the charges, the ministry offered little detail about the incident except to say it took place last year and described the dead man as ""an insurgent."" However, the British newspaper The Independent said Saturday the Marines were arrested after police found footage on a laptop during a separate investigation into pornographic material. The newspaper said the footage showed the Marines discussing whether they should offer medical aid to an injured man. The man was wounded while trying to ambush a patrol. He later died -- although the death was not captured on the footage, the paper said. Read more: Q&A: International troops in Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- Former presidential nominee and Sen. George McGovern has been admitted to a hospice in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, a spokeswoman for the facility said Monday. ""The family of Sen. McGovern wishes to extend their gratitude and appreciation for the many prayers and well wishes and requests complete privacy at this time,"" said Lindsey Meyers, spokeswoman for Avera McKennan Hospital and University Health Center. McGovern, 90, is best known for his unsuccessful 1972 campaign for president as the Democratic nominee against incumbent Republican Richard Nixon. In 1972, McGovern was selected as the Democratic Party nominee for president on a platform that included ending the war in Vietnam at a time when the country was torn over U.S. involvement there. Opinion: When candidates said 'no' to debates . ""Let us resolve that never again will we send the precious young blood of this country to die trying to prop up a corrupt military dictatorship abroad,"" he said to applause at the Democratic convention in Miami Beach. ""We mentioned Vietnam. That tore the Democratic Party in half,"" McGovern told CNN in 2006. ""You were either a hawk or a dove. You -- you weren't allowed to be neutral."" But the campaign started out poorly. He selected as running mate Sen. Thomas Eagleton of Missouri after a background check that did not turn up the fact that Eagleton had been treated for mental illness, a fact that was revealed soon thereafter. Eagleton withdrew and McGovern then tapped Sargent Shriver, a brother-in-law of John F. Kennedy and U.S. ambassador to France. The pair ended up losing in a lopsided vote for incumbent Richard Nixon, with the McGovern ticket earning only 17 electoral votes -- from Massachusetts and the District of Columbia -- to Nixon's 520. He represented South Dakota in the U.S. Senate and House before and after his presidential campaign, leaving the daily foray of politics after losing his 1980 bid for a fourth Senate term. Concessions complicated in contentious campaigns . McGovern has remained active since, including an appointment by then-President Bill Clinton as an ambassador to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and a 2001 appointment as the U.N.'s first global ambassador for hunger. He met his wife, Eleanor, while at Dakota Wesleyan University in 1941, before he joined the Army. He flew 35 combat missions as a B-24 bomber pilot in Europe, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. The McGoverns had five children, but one of their daughters died in 1994.

"New York (CNN) -- A 21-year-old foreign exchange student who authorities say tried to blow up New York's Federal Reserve Bank was indicted Thursday on charges of using a weapon of mass destruction and trying to provide material support to al Qaeda. Quazi Mohammad Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis, a Bangladeshi national, was arrested by federal authorities in a sting operation in October. He was accused of trying to detonate what he thought was a 1,000-pound bomb by using his cell phone as a trigger. The bomb was inert. Nafis, allegedly inspired by al Qaeda, came to the United States in January on a student visa under the pretext of attending college at Southeast Missouri State University, prosecutors said. Bangladeshi dad on son's arrest: 'We couldn't believe our ears' It's not clear whether Nafis maintained al Qaeda ties, but authorities say he claimed that the plot was his own and was his sole motivation for the U.S. trip. A U.S. District Court grand jury in New York charged Nafis with trying to use a bomb as a weapon of mass destruction and trying to provide explosives and communications equipment to al Qaeda terrorists, the indictment says. In Bangladesh, Nafis graduated from high school in 2006 and took his higher secondary school certificate examinations in 2008 before he enrolled in the country's leading private university, North South University, in Dhaka, documents say. Nafis traveled to the United States with ""the purpose of conducting a terrorist attack"" and actively sought out al Qaeda contacts after his arrival, authorities in New York allege. He majored in cybersecurity at Southeast Missouri State University from January to May of this year, a university spokeswoman said. At the end of the spring semester, he was elected vice president of the Muslim Student Association, but his term was short-lived because he left the campus, the spokeswoman said. Terror plotting: bravado or sincerity? His father, Quazi Mohammad Ahsanullah, has said that he can't believe the terrorist accusations and that his son is timid person who's often scared to travel alone. The father, a banker in Dhaka, said his son left college in Missouri after one semester because of the expense and went to New York, where he worked 10-hour days at a hotel. In the sting operation, Nafis apparently contacted an FBI source and proposed multiple targets, including a high-ranking U.S. official and the New York Stock Exchange, authorities said. Nafis indicated that he wanted to ""destroy America"" by going after the nation's financial institutions and ultimately settled on the landmark bank in Manhattan, authorities said. An undercover agent, authorities say, also provided 20 bags of purported explosives, weighing 50 pounds each, to Nafis, who then stored the material in a warehouse in preparation for the strike. Authorities alleged that Nafis further divulged a ""Plan B"" that involved carrying out a suicide attack should police thwart his initial effort. Packing his van with what he apparently believed were explosives, Nafis then allegedly traveled with the undercover agent to Manhattan's financial district, attached a detonator to the material and recorded a video statement in a nearby hotel before he was eventually arrested, authorities said. Susan Candiotti on alleged NY terror plot foiled: '""If this had been an actual bomb, he could have killed a lot of people' CNN's Susan Candiotti and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: The indictment accuses Nafis of trying to provide explosives to al Qaeda .

"(RollingStone.com) -- Scott Weiland has one more reason to be thankful this week -- the Stone Temple Pilots frontman is newly engaged to his girlfriend of one year, photographer Jamie Wachtel, he reveals exclusively to Rolling Stone. It will be the rocker's third marriage. ""I am incredibly happy,"" says Weiland. ""She is incredibly beautiful in every aspect of the word. Lovely, smart, passionate. And she loves my kids and I love her son. We're getting married in the spring, and our families will be living together . . . she's the greatest thing that's happened to me in a long, long time."" Weiland met Wachtel last year while filming music videos for his Christmas album, ""The Most Wonderful Time of the Year."" Wachtel, who was photographing the shoot, helped calm his nerves. ""I was kind of nervous because one of the songs [""I'll Be Home for Christmas""] was a tribute to war veterans from World War II on to today. So I'm in this vintage World War II dress outfit, and she was taking stills of me,"" Weiland recalls. ""I was leaning against this fireplace, and she's like, 'You might want to tuck in your belly a little bit.' It was around the holidays -- it was after Thanksgiving, and you know how that tends to be. I was kind of caught off guard, and I started laughing and she started laughing. And I don't know . . . something magical happened."" The two kept talking for the rest of the day, and Wachtel gave Weiland a ride home. ""I just thought, 'I have a feeling that I am going to fall in love with this woman,'"" he remembers. After his prior relationship ended, Weiland took Wachtel on their first date. ""It was truly remarkable,"" he says, ""because I had fallen in love a couple times in my life and then for a long time, I've been very disappointed and to the point where I've been resolved to the fact that possibly it would never happen again and almost accepted that it would be OK. And then I met her."" Before diving into the wedding planning, Weiland will hit the road later this month for a five-date solo tour, starting on November 25th in Glenside, Pennsylvania.

"(CNN) -- Singing folk songs and strumming the guitar at his campaign rallies, Hugo Chavez shows no sign that he's facing the strongest challenge to his 13-year rule in Venezuela. He has dismissed his much younger challenger, Henrique Capriles Radonski, as a ""fly"" not worth chasing, when challenged to a debate earlier this year. Chavez's opponents are confident that this Sunday, Capriles will unseat the long-ruling leftist leader, a refrain previously heard before eventual defeats. Yet the incumbent is a political survivor and remains popular at home. But there are signals, observers say, that this time Chavez really is on the ropes. Chavez's influence over Latin America's left-leaning governments has often rankled the United States, Venezuela's largest trading partner. Venezuela is the fourth-largest exporter of oil to the United States. Despite that tight economic relationship, the two countries are not exactly close allies: Chavez often rails against the U.S. and its allies as ""imperialists."" Chavez on U.S. election . Further complicating the U.S.-Venezuela relationship, Chavez is allied with Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, he defended former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and he has even offered his support for Syria's leader Bashar al-Assad. At stake for Venezuelans is the ideological trajectory of their country. Chavez, 58, has had more than a decade to implement his vision of 21st century socialism, a view that emphasizes use of state oil windfalls to fund social programs. Observers say Capriles, 40, represents a moderate alternative. He has vowed not end the social programs that Chavez has set up, and he promises to fight corruption that has grown in the public sector. The candidates offer two distinct paths to solve the problems that are on Venezuelans minds: decaying infrastructure, high crime rates and political polarization. Candidates hold dueling rallies . A close race? As expected, both sides claim they will be victorious -- and both sides have polls to back up those claims. Several polls gave Chavez a double-digit lead, while at least one gave Capriles a narrow lead. Chavez supporters say the majority of polls were clear. Those supporting Capriles say people were afraid to voice their real opinions. ""The information we get from the polls is, at best, confusing,"" said Federico Welsch, a political analyst and retired professor at Universidad Simon Bolivar. Part of the problem is ""an inherent bias in polling companies,"" according to Inaki Sagarzazu, a Venezuelan professor of politics at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, who has taken a closer look at the pollsters. Capriles, he noted, also must believe it is a close race, as evidenced by a speech this summer in which he spoke directly to the military, assuring them and other institutions that things will be OK if he wins. That address was significant because questions exist about whether the military, whose leadership ranks is stacked with Chavez loyalists, will accept a defeat. 2 killed as Venezuelan campaign turns violent . Controlling for biases, there are two conclusions that Sagarzazu has drawn from the polls: That Chavez is ""stuck"" with support near -- but not quite at -- 50%, and that Capriles is closing the gap. ""We're looking at a long night on October 7 because things look closer than polls or the government make it seem,"" he said. Chavez, cool and hip . New campaign posters for Chavez have featured him popping a wheelie on a motorcycle, playing basketball and even performing as a rap artist. It's a sharp contrast with the image of a sick man who was diagnosed with cancer last year and underwent two surgeries, in addition to multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation treatments. The image makeover is part of an effort to capture support for Chavez among Venezuela's undecided voters -- mostly young people -- who make up 23% of the electorate and could play a pivotal role in Sunday's election. Neither Chavez nor anyone in his government have publicly discussed what kind of cancer he has. He recently objected to a reporter's question about his health. ""Here I am, and every day, I feel in better physical condition,"" the president said. "" And I firmly believe, that that expression about physical limitations that you used, it's not going to be a factor in this campaign."" Crafting a youthful image is also important because Chavez is 18 years older than his political rival, who turned 40 over the summer. ""Venezuelans are looking for a new way,"" Capriles has told his supporters. ""It's been 14 years of the same government. This government has already completed its cycle and has nothing more to offer. They're only recycling promises."" Chavez, presumably because of his health, has not held as many rallies or traveled as often as he has in previous campaigns. His re-election effort has been mostly through presidential addresses that state-run television stations are mandated to carry. Chavez would have been unable to run for re-election this year because of constitutional limits. But his United Socialist Party of Venezuela pushed for a referendum in 2009 in which voters eliminated term limits. Winning another term in office next month would allow Chavez to rule Venezuela until 2019, the 20th anniversary of his rise to power. Whatever his health condition, Chavez remains a force in Venezuelan politics. His likeness is everywhere -- on television, on huge banners and the radio. His popularity remains high among Venezuelans, and his supporters remain as ardent as ever. However, Capriles has been constantly on the road, and his supporters say the momentum is shifting. ""We see it everyday, people are opening up their doors and inviting us in,"" said Tomas Guanipa, secretary-general of Capriles' Justice First party. With high stakes, accusations fly . The campaign has heated up in the final stretch, with accusations of improprieties flying back and forth. In the past month, the Capriles' campaign has accused Chavez of using a televised presidential address to bump an opposition campaign event from the airwaves. And the Chavez campaign released hidden-camera footage that purportedly showed one of Capriles' campaign leaders accepting a bribe. ""There are definitely moments of tension,"" said Welsch, the retired professor at Universidad Simon Bolivar. That tension has also erupted into violence at several campaign rallies. On Saturday, gunmen reportedly killed three pro-Capriles activists in the western Venezuelan state of Barinas. Earlier this month, in the port city of Puerto Cabello, a group of people identified as Chavez supporters -- also known as ""Chavistas"" -- threw rocks as Capriles made his way to a campaign rally. Several people were injured in an ensuing clash between the two sides. Capriles' Justice First party has accused the ruling party of harassment during the campaign, particularly when the Chavez campaign released a hidden-camera video showing a lawmaker working on Capriles' campaign accepting cash from a businessman. Chavez's campaign said the money purportedly was a bribe for his opponents campaign and accused the Capriles camp of financing itself in this way. Capriles responded to the video by firing the lawmaker and joining in the government's call for an investigation. ""It's a very difficult environment we are campaigning in,"" said Guanipa of Capriles' Justice First party. He characterized the harassment of the opposition campaign as acts of desperation from the ruling party. ""It's the agenda of someone who is defeated,"" he said. Representatives from Chavez's campaign declined to comment, but Chavez told reporters last week that a Capriles victory was impossible, citing polls. ""We are ready for the will of the people to be respected and for no one to come and disrespect the Venezuelan will,"" Chavez said. Meanwhile, a former minister and vice president under Chavez, Jose Vicente Rangel, accused the opposition of being capable of a coup or economic sabotage, if they lose. The back-and-forth accusations can only mean one thing, according to analyst Sagarzazu: ""All the shenanigans that have been happening point in the direction that the government knows that things are close."" The biggest question mark for observers abroad is whether the election will bring instability to Venezuela no matter who wins. Former U.S. ambassador to Venezuela, Patrick Duddy, said unrest is not inevitable, but in an analysis for the Council of Foreign Affairs, laid out several scenarios of concern, beginning with the fact that ""Chavez and several of his most senior associates have asserted that there will be instability and violence if he is not re-elected."" Violence could break out if it appears Chavez is going to lose, if he dies unexpectedly or if he wins with the appearance of cheating, Duddy wrote. ""Although Chavez has indicated he will respect the results of the election, most plausible scenarios for instability and conflict in Venezuela derive from the premise that the Chavistas will not willingly surrender power and would be willing to provoke violence, orchestrate civil unrest or engage in various forms of armed resistance to avoid doing so,"" Duddy said.

"Hempstead, New York (CNN) -- President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney face off Tuesday in the second of their three debates, this one in a town hall-style setting in which they'll take questions from likely voters. The stakes couldn't be higher: Obama must get his campaign back on track after a poor performance in the first debate that left Democrats demoralized and Obama's lead evaporating both in national polls and those in key battleground states. For Romney, who polls among voters showed won the first debate overwhelmingly, a second strong performance would boost his momentum going into the third debate next Monday and the final two weeks before Election Day. Here are five things to watch for on Tuesday: . 1. Connecting with the audience . Unlike the first presidential showdown in Denver two weeks ago, this debate will include a town hall audience of approximately 80 undecided voters, some of whom will get the chance to ask questions to the two candidates. It's a completely different dynamic than the first face-off between the president and the Republican nominee. ""The challenge is that they've got to connect, not just with the people that are looking into the television and watching them, but to the people that are on the stage with them,"" the debate's moderator, CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley, said. Get instant updates on CNN's live blog . ""They have to keep those folks in mind. It's a much more intimate and up close adventure with voters. The candidate that makes a connection with the person asking the question is also making a better connection with the person back at home,"" added Crowley, who's also the host of CNN's ""State of the Union."" With no podium to hide behind in Tuesday's debate, the candidates' style and body language will be in the spotlight. If you don't think this matters, flash back 20 years to the first town hall-style presidential debate when then-President George H.W. Bush repeatedly checked his watch. It was a sign, some thought, that the incumbent would rather have been anywhere else than debating Democratic challenger Bill Clinton. The Arkansas governor highlighted his ability to connect to voters by walking towards the town hall audience when answering a question about the recession. Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala, who was chief strategist for Clinton's campaign, agrees with Crowley on the importance of connecting with the audience. ""If you do that -- with empathy, compassion, understanding and cool strength -- you will win the debate and the election,"" said Begala, who's a senior adviser for a pro-Obama super PAC. John King: Stakes enormous in second debate . 2. Find a warm place . After a lackluster performance in the first debate, it's obvious the president needs to step it up in Round 2. Even Obama himself admits he was flat in the face-off in Denver, telling ABC News, ""I had a bad night."" The big question is how aggressive will the president be in this second showdown? Obama needs to look like a fighter. The normally cool president needs to heat it up, but he can't come off looking overly aggressive or negative. That might smack of desperation. ""Don't over-correct. Don't go from being too passive in the first debate to too aggressive in the second,"" Begala cautioned. ""You need the Goldilocks Strategy: Not as cool as the first debate, not as hot as Vice President Joe Biden."" Poll: Debate-watchers split on who won VP debate . Making Obama's task even tougher is the debate format. Many of the questions from the audience of undecided voters may focus on the president's record the past four years, forcing Obama to defend himself in front of the crowd, before attempting to pivot to criticizing his GOP challenger. It's a delicate dance. But Begala says Obama can learn from Biden's performance at last week's vice presidential debate by emulating ""Biden's combination of facts with common sense."" And we're also going to watch to see if the president plays the empathy card. ""Obama needs to connect the struggles and sacrifices his family made to the struggles families in the town hall audience are going through. Romney can't do that,"" Begala added. Opinion: Do facts matter? 3. Getting women's issues into the conversation . Obama pollster Joel Benenson released a harshly worded memo on Monday attacking the Gallup organization over a new poll, released in tandem with USA Today, that showed Romney now tied with Obama among women voters. You read that right. After months of leading Romney by double digits among women, his lead among female voters has effectively vanished, if you believe that poll. Benenson savaged Gallup's methodology and dismissed the poll as an outlier. He's correct that no other survey has shown Romney performing that well among women. But for Chicago's sake, he better be right. Along with his impenetrable lead among Hispanics and a near total hold on African-American voters, Obama has led Romney all year thanks to his robust support among women. If that disappears, so do the president's re-election hopes. What does this mean for Tuesday night? Women-specific issues -- topics like abortion, contraception, child care, education -- did not come up at length in the first Obama-Romney showdown. Obama ad's Planned Parenthood focus . They did in the vice presidential debate, however, and Romney running mate Paul Ryan scored poorly among women in debate-watching focus groups when he explained Romney's opposition to abortion rights. If Obama hopes to lock in his lead among women, he must find a way to get issues like abortion and contraception in the spotlight in order to draw a sharp contrast with Romney. 4. Strong performance pays off -- literally . A strong debate showing doesn't just move numbers, it raises money. Romney's energetic performance in Denver -- which voters judged as a clear win, polls showed -- accomplished something very important for the Republican nominee. In short, his supporters now like him. Test yourself: Debate trivia . Before the debate, according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll out Monday, fewer than half of Romney supporters said they were ""very enthusiastic"" about his candidacy. Today, the ""very enthusiastic"" number is up to 62% among likely voters. That's crucial for Romney, who needs a fired-up base of supporters to show up on Election Day. But the more immediate post-debate impact was financial: Romney raised more than $12 million online in the 48 hours after Denver, his campaign announced just a few days after the debate. And if a campaign is rolling out fundraising data before the federal deadline for financial reports, you know they're feeling good. On top of that, the campaign said it raised $27 million online from low-dollar contributors in the first two weeks of October. Strong debate leads to fund-raising windfall for Romney . That's good money for a campaign currently engaged in an all-out television ad blitz in key swing states. Both campaigns are in the process of emptying their war chests for the final three-week push before Election Day. A burst of online donations means an extra TV ad here and a final volley of mail pieces there. In a race this tight, every little bit counts. 5. Watch out for the wild card . The economy is still issue No. 1 for voters in this election. Foreign policy and national security have also crept into the discussion, with tensions in the Middle East slightly eroding Obama's edge over Romney on the commander-in-chief question. But unlike in the previous two debates, when editorial control rested in the hands of the moderator, Monday's debate is a town-hall style forum, in which the audience, about 80 undecided voters from Nassau County, will be the ones generating questions for the candidates. That means there's a real chance Obama and Romney will have to talk about something that might not have come up in their exhaustive debate prep sessions. A question on affirmative action? Funding for AIDS-relief efforts overseas? Guns? NFL head-trauma? Is that Brody guy from ""Homeland"" really a terrorist? Theoretically, anything is on the table. The moderator, Candy Crowley, and her team will have final say over the submitted questions. But with regular people in the mix, there's always potential for a wild card that could throw one or both of the candidates off his game. Are you voting? Tell us why on CNN iReport .","How well candidates connect with audience members could affect outcome .
Obama must overcome passive first performance without overdoing it .
Women's issues are one area Obama must exploit if he wants to maintain their support .

"(CNN) -- London police have dropped an investigation into Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg after he was accused of using inappropriate language towards a footballer from Chelsea. The official was the subject of a complaint to the Football Association (FA) from Chelsea after their 3-2 defeat by Manchester United in October but vehemently denies their claims. The club claimed Clattenburg used ""inappropriate language,"" thought to be of a racist nature, during an exchange with their Nigerian midfielder John Obi Mikel. Subsequently, the Society of Black Lawyers made a complaint to the Metropolitan police, who now say the probe has been shelved due to a lack of evidence. A statement read: ""An investigation was launched into alleged comments made during a football match between Chelsea FC and Manchester United FC at Stamford Bridge on 28 October 2012. ""This follows on from a complaint received by the Metropolitan Police Service on 29 October. Enquires were made and no victims have come forward. The matter will remain as a recorded incident. ""Without a victim and/or any evidence that any offence has been committed, the matter cannot currently be investigated. ""If the situation changes and a victim and/or evidence to support an allegation of a crime comes to police attention then further enquiries will if appropriate be made."" Clattenburg has not officiated a match since Chelsea filed their report with the FA, and the 37-year-old looks set to be kept out of the firing line until their investigation is completed. That could be as early as Wednesday, as the English game's governing body strives to prevent the issue dragging on as other racism cases that have dogged soccer of late. Chelsea captain John Terry has only recently completed a four match ban for using racist language during a Premier League game with Queens Park Rangers in October 2011. The FA could only reach their own verdict after Terry's case had been heard in a criminal court and in July the former England captain was found not guilty of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand, brother of Manchester United defender Rio. Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck rejected criticism of the club on Tuesday after they were labeled hypocritical for their handling of the Clattenburg and Terry situations. He told the London Evening Standard newspaper: ""Suppose we had tried to sweep this under the rug and said to the various players, 'Look, it's not a big deal and the press are going to be all over us, maybe you want to reconsider.' ""If that had leaked out, we would've really been crucified. The press seem to juxtapose 'our support' of John Terry and what's going on here and looking at us as being a bit hypocritical. We have to divorce the John Terry situation from this."" Last season Liverpool striker Luis Suarez was banned for eight matches after being found guilty of racially abusing Manchester United's French defender Patrice Evra. Recently, a number of black players refused to wear T-shirts promoting an anti-racism campaign in protest at a perceived lack of action about the problem.","Police drop their investigation into Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg .

"(CNN) -- Senegal were disqualified from the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations on Tuesday, as the Confederation of African Football (CAF) confirmed Ivory Coast's participation at January's finals in South Africa. Senegal's second leg playoff qualifier against the Ivorians on Saturday was called off by the referee after 74 minutes as disgruntled fans rioted moments after Didier Drogba scored to give the visitors a 6-2 aggregate lead at the Leopold Senghor Stadium in Dakar. ""CAF decided to officially confirm that result of the match as 2-0 in favour of Ivory Coast in accordance with the provisions of article 16 para 20 of the regulations of the competition and to consider Senegal the loser of the said match and eliminated from the competition,"" African football's ruling body said in a statement. After meeting at CAF headquarters in the Egyptian capital Cairo on Tuesday, the organization also stipulated that Senegal's disqualification will not prevent then from receiving further sanctions. If previous CAF punishments are followed, Senegal can expect to play some future competitive qualifiers away from their capital Dakar. After crowd trouble by home fans followed Togo's elimination from the 2008 Nations Cup by visitors Mali, the Togolese were punished by playing their next three competitive games in a neutral venue and barred from hosting a match at their national stadium for six months. Read: Cape Verde and Ethiopia shake up Africa Cup of Nations . Senegal has experienced crowd trouble before, most notably when another qualifying failure -- for the World Cup and Nations Cup finals in 2010 -- sparked fans into throwing rocks onto the pitch in Dakar while lighting fans inside and outside the stadium. Despite violence which also saw the stadium's windows smashed by fans, Senegal's football federation received no ban from either CAF or world governing body FIFA. On Saturday, some Ivorian supporters made a perilous five-meter leap from the bleachers onto the running track around the pitch before joining players from both teams in the center circle as they all sheltered from the violence. The second leg of the final round qualifier was suspended for 40 minutes before the referee decided to cancel the match. Even though CAF had yet to confirm Ivory Coast's qualification for the 2013 Nations Cup, the Elephants were included in the tournament seedings by African football's ruling body on Monday. The 2012 runners-up were placed in the highest ranked group of seeds, along with Ghana, host nation South Africa and reigning champions Zambia. The 2013 finals take place between 19 January and 10 February.","Senegal disqualified from 2013 Africa Cup of Nations after rioting caused abandonment of match on Saturday .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea on Monday reprimanded five senior military officials after admitting that a North Korean soldier had managed to cross the heavily patrolled border between the two countries undetected and knock on the door of his enemy's barracks. Revelations about the ease with which the North Korean soldier reached the South Korean side of the border, considered to be the most heavily militarized in the world, have prompted criticism of the nation's military. Read more: S. Korea fires warning shots at N. Korean fishing boats . The soldier, whose name and rank were not disclosed, jumped three barbed-wire fences along the eastern part of the border without being spotted on October 2, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry. He was picked up by South Korean soldiers in the province of Kangwon only after he knocked on a barracks door, wishing to defect, the ministry said. He had escaped from his unit and traveled about 50 kilometers (31 miles) through North Korean territory to get to the border zone. South Korean Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin made a public apology in a live broadcast on national television Monday, calling the incident ""a clear failure in security operations."" ""As the defense minister, I express sincere apology for causing concern to our people,"" he said. Read more: N. Korea taunts S. Korean candidate with 'Gangnam Style'-inspired video . Kim said a lieutenant general, two major generals and two brigadier generals were facing disciplinary action. He also pledged to enhance security measures and increase the number of soldiers around the border area. The security breach was deemed ""lamentable"" in an editorial last week by The Korea Times, an English-language newspaper. ""What if the defector were an agent armed with guns and grenades who sneaked into the barracks on orders from the North?"" the editorial asked. It also criticized the initially misleading information about the situation from defense officials. The South Korean military had announced a subsequent defection across the border on October 6, in which a North Korean solider on guard duty at the border told authorities in the South that he had killed his superiors before fleeing across the Military Demarcation Line. North Korean soldier shoots comrades before defecting to South . At the time, defense officials said it was the first defection over land since March 2010. But news of the controversial October 2 defection and another in September later emerged after a South Korean lawmaker, Kim Kwang-jin from the main opposition Democratic United Party, questioned officials from the Joint Chiefs of Staff in a parliamentary hearing last week. In a statement, he criticized the ""lies and deception from the military."" According to the lawmaker, at least 10 divisions from the South Korean army and two Marine Corps divisions are guarding the roughly 250-kilometer-long border area. Defections over land through the heavily armed and patrolled border area are rare, as most prefer to try crossing by sea or going through China. More than 24,000 refugees have entered the South from the North since the country's division, according to the Ministry of Unification in Seoul.","The North Korea-South Korea border is considered the most heavily militarized in the world .

"(CNN) -- There are some sports figures who, no matter who else is playing, make you simply want to turn on the television to see what kind of excitement they will bring to the game. Barry Sanders. Deion Sanders. Michael Jordan. Reggie Jackson. Wayne Gretzky. Pele. They make up some of the greatest to ever play their respective sports, and when they hit the field, court or ice, all eyes were on them. Texas A&M University quarterback Johnny Manziel hasn't remotely achieved their level of stardom, but when it comes to being Mr. Excitement in college football, man, this kid can flat electrify the crowd with his play and leave his opponents shaking their heads in frustration. I don't care about Chip Kelly's offense or Alabama's defense or how Bill Snyder has revived Kansas State's football program. There is no doubt that Johnny ""Football"" Manziel has taken the college football world by storm, and maybe by the end of the season, he could be the first freshman ever to win the Heisman Trophy. Yes, the kid is just that good. When Texas A&M made the decision to leave the Big 12 to play in the Southeastern Conference, fans and the media alike forecasted a tough few years for the Aggies. Everyone said, ""Welcome to big boy football,"" citing the recent national champions that have hailed from the conference. The critics said the noble men of Kyle Field -- Texas A&M's home stadium -- would be the doormat of the league, languishing at the bottom and following the path of Arkansas, who left the Aggies in the Southwest Conference in 1991 for the SEC and disappeared into oblivion. See highlights from Texas A&M's win over Alabama . All of that changed last Saturday when the Aggies went to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, for the first time and knocked off the defending national champions and the No. 1-ranked team in the country, the Alabama Crimson Tide. The one play that will be remembered was the touchdown where Manziel stepped up in the pocket, ran into one of his own players, the ball popped up in the air, he caught it, rolled left and found Ryan Swope in the back of the end zone. He is a fearless kid. Slide after a big run? Nope. Manziel wants to take the head off a linebacker or a safety by slamming into them. He's not built like a Mack truck in the mold of Tim Tebow. But after the hit, he pops up and runs around the field like an 8-year-old ready for the next play. The mania around Johnny Football has taken on epic proportions. And it's only going to get bigger, which says a lot in Texas, where football has long been like a religion. Manziel's emergence is excellent for the ninth-ranked Texas A&M Aggies and first-year Coach Kevin Sumlin. For decades, Texas A&M has played in the shadows of its archrival, the Texas Longhorns. While A&M has enjoyed some successful teams in the last two decades, the Longhorns have long been a national power. The success of the Aggies with Manziel will no doubt help recruiting. And if the runaway candidate to be the MVP of the SEC continues to meet the Heisman hype, the legend of Johnny Football will only grow. That's good for my alma mater, Texas A&M; good for the SEC; and good the casual fan who desires a mythical figure to root for.","Roland Martin: Texas A&M QB Johnny Manziel has taken the college football world by storm .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The real crisis confronting the eurozone is regaining market confidence, not the euro, German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said Friday. ""Some people wonder if we're overcoming the euro crisis the right way,"" said Westerwelle, speaking at the Asia Society in Hong Kong. ""We do not have a euro crisis, we have a debt crisis which has morphed into a crisis of confidence. The euro is stable and is the number two reserve currency in the world."" To bolster market confidence in the eurozone, Westerwelle -- who is part of the cabinet-level entourage traveling with German Chancellor Angela Merkel for her two-day summit in China -- said it was essential that Greece and other debt-laden economies in Europe maintain paths toward reform. Athens and Berlin in spat over funds . Greek cuts to be deeper than trailed . Last week, Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin to ask for more ""breathing space"" for Greece to implement austerity reforms. The troika -- consisting of the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund -- is due to report on Greece's progress next month. ""I don't want to be part of this Greece bashing, because it's a real challenge for them. I feel for the people on the streets of Greece, because the people weren't responsible for what their leaders missed in the past decade. ""We feel solidarity but we have to insist they fulfill what they promised,"" Westerwelle continued. ""We can't allow them to weaken the reform agenda. It would have a very negative effect in trying to restore confidence to Greece and the European Union."" He also questioned how the Spanish government could be persuaded to stay on path if any agreement with Greece was weakened. Catalonia heightens Spanish debt fears . Westerwelle pointed to Germany's own debt woes in the wake of West Germany's reunification with East Germany during the 1990s. ""It was only 10 years ago that Germany was the sick man of Europe. Reforms may be painful, but they will pay off and that's what we Germans have experienced first hand,"" he said. Even as he advocates strict adherence to austerity measures, Westerwelle has been a strong voice against politicians who suggest Greece should soon exit the eurozone. ""The bullying against individual euro countries to achieve political gains must stop,"" Westerwelle said after Alexander Dobrindt, the executive secretary of the Christian Social Union of Bavaria, suggested a Greek departure was imminent, the German daily Rheinische Post reported on Monday. Earlier this month, Westerwelle warned on the ""dangerous tone"" arguments on European Union were taking. ""We must take care not to talk Europe down,"" he said in a statement, released after Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti told a German paper that eurozone tensions ""bear the traits of a psychological dissolution of Europe."" As developing economies like China and India create more regional centers of financial power, a strong EU is ""life insurance"" for Germany's future, especially as the eurozone represents only about 9% of the world population, Westerwelle continued. ""Europe and European unity is not only our destiny, but our desire,"" he said. ""There can be no good future for Germany without a good future for a united Europe,"" Westerwelle said.

"(CNN) -- Chicago Bulls Guard Derrick Rose broke down in tears at a press conference when asked what a new shoe contract worth $250 million meant to him. His responses on camera and on Twitter were about his feelings on the teachers strike in Chicago. He had a $250 million shoe contract, but the youth of his hometown of Chicago were on the mind of this young man. It was obvious that Rose understood the political aspect, but he focused on the human aspect -- he realizes that he could have easily been one of the kids killed in the senseless violence that has ravaged his native city, he realizes he is fortunate -- and if you were a witness to the interview, you would agree that the last thing on his mind was a tax break. Also recently, Baltimore Ravens player Brendon Ayanbadejo's took a public stand on LBGT rights. It prompted Emmett Burns, a state delegate from Baltimore County, to ask that Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, ""take the necessary action, as a National Football League owner, to inhibit such expressions from your employees and that he be ordered to cease and desist such injurious actions. I know of no other NFL player who has done what Mr. Ayanbadejo is doing."" It was a perfect example of a critic using the ""shut up and play"" motto. Ayenbendajo's stance is one that has been taken up by other NFL players, such as Michael Irvin, but maybe the best response came from fellow LBGT supporter Minnesota punter Chris Kluwe, who wrote possibly one of the best political statements ever made by an athlete to Burns. Kluwe's second point in the letter reads: . ""You wrote, 'Many of your fans are opposed to such a view and feel it has no place in a sport that is strictly for pride, entertainment and excitement.' Holy --ing --balls. Did you seriously just say that, as someone who is, according to your Wikipedia page, 'deeply involved in government task forces on the legacy of slavery in Maryland?' Have you not heard of Kenny Washington? Jackie Robinson? As recently as 1962 the NFL still had segregation, which was only done away with by brave athletes and coaches daring to speak their mind and do the right thing, and you're going to say that political views have 'no place in a sport'? I can't even begin to fathom the cognitive dissonance that must be coursing through your rapidly addled mind right now; the mental gymnastics your brain has to tortuously contort itself through to make such a preposterous statement are surely worthy of an Olympic gold medal (the Russian judge gives you a 10 for 'beautiful oppressionism')."" Social media allows for a constant, entertaining and unfiltered window into users' thoughts. It has become an arena where the convictions, thoughts, feelings and politics of some of our favorite athletes take the forefront. Facebook and Twitter have revolutionized how we communicate with sports icons, because anyone with an IP address can express themselves any way they choose from anywhere in the world. Social media helped bring fans closer to athletes and to feel a part of the game, with real-time responses in some instances. Yet something unexpected has happened. Fans are getting a direct line into some of the personal issues and opinions that historically were heavily guarded. In the past, agents and marketing personnel felt if athletes gave their opinions on hot topics, it could destroy huge endorsement contracts. This complicated view of sports and politics has historically led to a series of great moments, as well as missed opportunities, depending on your political point of view. It was the tempestuous climate of the 1960s that displayed the most famous political stances from athletes. Moments of protest were thrust into the living rooms of a worldwide audience: First was Muhammad Ali's historic stand against the draft process and the Vietnam War. Then came the 1968 Olympic Summer Games in which John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists to the sky in protest, with Peter Norman wearing an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge to support them. The media attention helped propel what can be considered one of the most iconic images and moments in sports into a historic notion of free speech. While those athletes' political stances are admired and even idolized today, they faced major repercussions back then. Ali was stripped of his title and boxing license, while Smith and Carlos were forced to relinquish their medals. Atlanta native Mel Pender, who won a gold medal in those Olympics as a member of the 4x100 relay, witnessed that moment firsthand. ""Athletes don't do enough when it comes to politics,"" Pender said. The statement that was made that day in Mexico City was not intended to bring attention to the fight for freedom and equality for black people, but for all people. There will always be someone on the other side of the issue. For our athletes, the backlash can be debilitating to their career, finances or fan base. Social media and its unfiltered commentary has in some ways become a PR agent's worst nightmare. That intimate window into athletes' thoughts has no buffer and is putting the power into their hands. Jim Brown has urged some of the world's most notable athletes, like Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods, to take a stand on social and political issues for years. Brown questioned their need to protect their image over standing up for what was right. LZ Granderson, in an August commentary for ESPN, discussed the evolution of sports and politics as it relates to Michael Jordan. During Jordan's early playing days he refused to support Democratic candidate Harvey Gantt, who was running for a Senate seat. Jordan famously declared, ""Republicans buy sneakers, too."" At that time there would likely have been backlash against Jordan, who as a retiree recently hosted a private fundraising dinner for President Obama. These days, famous athletes are open with their views without any fear of backlash. Tim Tebow appeared in an anti-abortion commercial with his mother and is very active on Twitter discussing his faith. In the spring, the Miami Heat players, in a show of solidarity during the Trayvon Martin shooting investigation, united for a hooded photo honoring Martin's memory. The sports world is evolving much the way the world is adjusting to social media and new ideas. This new age of athletes are willing to use their social status to influence the political and cultural landscape. Change is constant, but growth is optional. Social media has united athletes and fans in a way that not many other avenues can. You may not always agree with the stance of your favorite athlete, but at least these days they have an opinion, and it seems they are willing to let the world know.","Pro athletes use social media to discuss the election, Chicago teachers strike, gay rights .

"(CNN) -- Nelson Mandela, anti-apartheid icon, Nobel peace laureate and South Africa's first black president, celebrated his 90th birthday Friday by doing something he had indicated he would not do again -- grant an interview to journalists. Mandela sits at the 6th Nelson Mandela Lecture in Soweto, Johannesburg. A cheerful-looking Mandela welcomed CNN's Robyn Curnow, along with reporters from two other organizations, into the sitting room of his home in Qunu, a small village in the rolling hills of South Africa's eastern Cape region where he grew up. ""What day is this?"" Mandela joked, pretending not to realize it was his birthday. He used a smile to dodge Curnow's first question of what was his favorite memory from his long life. He did say he was very happy to have lived to be 90. Mandela credited his longevity to the way he conducted his life. He is known to be disciplined with his diet and exercise. Asked if, in hindsight, he wishes he had spent more time with his family, he answered yes. ""I don't regret it because the things that attracted me were things that pleased my soul."" Graca Machel, whom he married on his 80th birthday, sat nearby and Mandela was surrounded by grandchildren.  Watch what Mandela's grandchildren have to say » . Mandela then lamented the gap between rich and poor in South Africa. ""Poverty still grips our people. If you're poor, you're not likely to live for long,"" he said.  Watch CNN's Mandela interview » . This was Mandela's first meeting with reporters since he announced in 2004 that he would give no more interviews. While he stayed out of the spotlight over the last four years, he has stayed busy with his charitable causes. All week residents of Qunu, 600 miles south of Johannesburg, have been making preparations for the celebrations. Events planned include a soccer festival, a pop concert and lunch for 500 politicians, veterans of the anti-apartheid struggle and other guests at his home Saturday. An exhibition of letters that children wrote to Mandela and the late U.S. civil rights campaigner Rosa Parks will be displayed at the Nelson Mandela Museum, a short distance from his house. ""We are very excited,"" local school principal Mpondomise Ndzambo told the Associated Press, sitting in his office beneath a photograph of the former president. ""Usually these celebrations are done in Johannesburg, so this is a way of being part of it."" Send your birthday messages . In 1964, a court sentenced Mandela to life in prison for plotting to overthrow the government by violence. He spent the first 18 years at Robben Island Prison, off Cape Town, South Africa, and later spent time at Pollsmoor prison and Victor Verster Prison, closer to the mainland. While in prison, Mandela became recognized as the most significant black leader in South Africa, and he became a potent symbol of resistance in the anti-apartheid movement. Mandela consistently refused to compromise his political position to obtain his freedom. South Africa's last apartheid-era president who also served as Mandela's vice president, F.W. de Klerk, released Mandela in February 1990 after 27 years in prison. Mandela was elected president of the African National Congress the following year, and in 1994, he was elected president of his country. As South Africa's first black president -- he only ran for one term -- Mandela ushered in a democratic, multiracial society that is still going strong. In a fitting tribute de Klerk described Mandela as ""one of the greatest figures of the 20th century,"" AP reported. Mandela's recent birthday tribute concert in London's Hyde Park marked the 20 year anniversary of the Free Mandela event that was held in the same city to demand his release from prison. During the concert a frail Mandela told cheering fans, ""Your voices carried across the water to inspire us in our prison cells far away. Tonight, we can stand before you free. ""We are honored to be back in London for this wonderful occasion. ""But even as we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. ""Where there is poverty and sickness, including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done. Our work is for freedom for all."" Proceeds from the London concert went toward the 46664 Campaign, which Mandela founded in 2003 to raise awareness about the impact of AIDS, especially in Africa, and to promote HIV-prevention measures around the world. The name of the charity represents Mandela's prison number when he was incarcerated at Robben Island. Organizers put 46,664 tickets up for sale.","Mandela: Called on the rich to help the poor in birthday interview .

"(CNN) -- A 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck off Japan's eastern coast early Tuesday, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. With a depth of 9 kilometers (5.6 miles), the tremor was about 96 kilometers (almost 60 miles) east-northeast of Miyako and 550 kilometers (342 miles) north-northeast of Tokyo, according to the U.S. agency. The quake occurred just over a year and a half since a 9.0-magnitude earthquake triggered a huge tsunami off Japan, resulting in thousands of deaths and the world's worst nuclear crisis in a quarter century. The Japan Meteorological Agency, however, did not issue any tsunami warnings or advisories immediately after the Tuesday morning quake, according to its website. No such warnings were issued by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center either. A little more than 30 minutes after this first earthquake, another significant, if slightly weaker one, hit the same general area. This 5.1-magnitude tremor was about the same distance from Tokyo as the first and about 107 kilometers (66 miles) east of Miyako -- which was among the areas devastated by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami -- according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Tuesday's second quake was much deeper than the first, rooted about 38 kilometers (23.6 miles) below sea level.","NEW: A second, slightly smaller quake hits about 30 minutes later in the same area .

It was centered about 550 kilometers (342 miles) north-northeast of Tokyo .
A stronger March 2011 quake triggered a tsunami that led to thousands of deaths ."
