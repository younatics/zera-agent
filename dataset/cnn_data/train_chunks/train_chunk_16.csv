"LOS ANGELES, California -- On Earth Day on Wednesday, Dr. David Jentsch marched at the head of a column of UCLA students and faculty members to the chant of, ""Stand up for science!"" Across the street a smaller but equally vocal group of animal rights advocates chanted, ""U-C-L-A, how many animals have you killed today!"" Animal rights activists say large numbers of animals are killed each year during medical trials. Until recently, Jentsch had never dreamed he would lead a political demonstration. But Jentsch's life took a sharp turn last month when his car was firebombed in his driveway. A radical group of animal rights activists claimed responsibility for the act. ""This is terror,"" Jentsch said. ""There is no two ways about it. It's extremism. It's an attempt to intimidate."" It was the latest in a string of arson attacks against UCLA researchers who use animals in medical research projects. Since 2006, there have been seven attacks aimed at researcher's homes or cars. No arrests have been made in the cases, which are being investigated by an FBI lead task force on terrorism. ""We believe it's just a matter of time before someone is going to be hurt,"" said FBI Assistant Director in Charge Salvador Hernandez. ""The intent of these groups is to intimidate and coerce."" Hernandez heads up the task force investigating the series of attacks and says their actions qualify as terrorist attacks. But animal rights advocate Chris DeRose says nothing could be further from the truth . ""There has never been one human being in this country being killed or even hurt,"" he said. He believes the university researchers are the bad guys. ""What I do condemn is what goes on behind those walls,"" he says. DeRose, founder of Last Chance for Animals, says he doesn't condone firebombing researchers' homes, but he doesn't condemn it either.  Watch people against animal research at protest » . ""The reason these people are doing it is because they have been pushed ... nobody is listening ... over a hundred million animals a year are killed in universities and major hospitals in this country,"" he said. Jentsch argues that same medical research using lab animals has lead to many medical breakthroughs that benefit mankind. UCLA points to research advances in breast cancer treatments, Parkinson's disease and artificial heart technology that relied on experiments involving lab animals at their California facilities. Jentsch's own research involves studies aimed at treating drug addiction in humans. He studies the brains of monkeys that have been injected with methamphetamine. He says his experiments are peer-reviewed and adhere strictly to established rules for the treatment of lab animals.  Watch supporters of animal research at protest » . Jentsch says that he hopes that this week's dueling demonstrations can lead to a dialogue. He believes many of the protestors voicing opposition to the UCLA labs do not endorse the string of violent acts aimed against him and other researchers, ""but it is essential for them to repudiate this type of activity."" In the meantime, Jentsch says he refuses to be intimidated. ""I'm going to continue to live where I live, continue to educate people about my work,"" he said. ""I'm not going to stop.""","Dr. David Jentsch joins protest after his car was firebombed last month .

"(CNN) -- The sport of polo needs new oversight to protect its prized horses, the nation's largest animal protection organization said after reports that a pharmacy's mistake with medication may have killed 21 animals. People attend a memorial ceremony Thursday for 21 polo horses that died Sunday in Wellington, Florida. ""This tragedy has brought to light the absence of drug policies and regulation within the sport of polo,"" said Keith Dane, director of equine protection for the Humane Society of the United States. ""There are no prohibitions or testing requirements for the use of drugs or other performance-enhancing substances,"" Dane said in a statement. The HSUS statement called on the polo community ""to use this tragedy as a catalyst to begin implementing reforms to ensure that policies are enacted and enforced that will ensure better protection for the horses in its care."" But a veteran Florida polo player is urging would-be reformers to take it slow. ""If you step back and look at the reality of the situation, it was a misformulation of a vitamin and mineral supplement that killed the horses, not performance-enhancing drugs,"" said Don Dufresne, who describes himself as an equine legal expert and horse lover.  Watch what a pharmacy says happened » . ""If this were a pervasive problem in polo, and if this were to happen twice in the last year or something ... then yes, I think that (regulation) would be appropriate,"" said Dufresne, who is a member of the sport's equine welfare committee but emphasized he was not speaking for the panel. ""I don't see this as a pervasive problem,"" he said. ""We have no reports to my knowledge of anyone using performance-enhancing drugs other than vitamins and mineral supplements."" The sport's governing body, the U.S. Polo Association, has been considering taking up such testing for several years, John Wash, operations president of the club where the horses fell ill Sunday, said this week. ""People are calling for reform, and maybe that needs to happen,"" he said. A tearful memorial ceremony for the horses was held Thursday evening at the International Polo Club Palm Beach in Wellington, Florida. As part of the service, bagpipers played and people tossed flowers into a pond on the grounds.  Watch scenes from the memorial » . Play resumed in the U.S. Open Polo Championship after matches were postponed by the horse disaster Sunday and rain Wednesday. A veterinary pharmacy in Florida acknowledged Thursday that it incorrectly prepared medication used to treat the 21 horses that died. An internal investigation by Franck's Pharmacy in Ocala, Florida, ""concluded that the strength of an ingredient in the medication was incorrect. We will cooperate fully with the authorities as they continue their investigations,"" the company said in a statement issued Thursday afternoon. ""We extend our most sincere condolences to the horses' owners, the Lechuza Polo team and the members of the United States Polo Association. We share their grief and sadness,"" the pharmacy's chief operations officer, Jennifer Beckett, said in the statement. The pharmacy said it prepared medication for the horses on orders from a veterinarian. Many teams commonly give horses injections of vitamin B12 and other nutritional supplements before competitions to prevent muscle cramps and help them recover after the match, Dufresne said. ""When you talk about polo ponies, we consider them equine athletes,"" he said. ""A horse is so important to your game as a player, you want the horses to be as healthy as they can be, to last as long as they can. ... ""You don't want to overexert a horse. A tired horse is an unsafe horse."" The pharmacy that made the error is likely to be sued, which should put all pharmacies on sufficient notice to prevent future errors, he said. ""Everybody wants to ensure that what their horses are getting is correct and is not going to harm their horse. I thing everybody is going to become more aware of this and more cautious."" Liz Compton, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, told CNN that the agency is awaiting toxicology results from the animals and could not comment on the pharmacy's disclosure. ""Obviously, we are going to follow any and every potential lead to get to the bottom of this,"" she said. The horses were trained by Lechuza Polo, a Venezuela-based team. Its captain, Juan Martin Nero, told an Argentine newspaper earlier this week that he had ""no doubts"" vitamins administered to the animals were at fault. ""There were five horses that did not get the vitamin, and those were the only ones that survived,"" Nero said. Post-mortem examinations done by a University of Florida laboratory found significant hemorrhaging in several horses, but the findings did not single out a specific cause. CNN's Jim Kavanagh and Kim Segal contributed to this report.","NEW: Regulation not necessary after simple mistake, polo veteran says .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- At least seven Iraqis were killed and 23 wounded when a bomb exploded near a Shiite holy shrine in northern Baghdad on Wednesday morning, an Interior Ministry official said. The Imam Musa al-Kadhim shrine in Baghdad, Iraq, seen in 2007, is holy to Shiite Muslims. The bomb detonated near the Imam Musa al-Kadhim shrine in the Kadhimiya district, the official said. The Kadhimiya shrine is one of the holiest shrines for Shiite Muslims around the world. On Tuesday, a parked car bomb killed at least nine people and wounded more than a dozen others, also in Kadhimiya. This is the third straight day of deadly attacks in the capital, striking mostly Shiite areas. On Monday, seven bombings in Baghdad left at least 32 people killed and more than 130 wounded. Iraqi officials have warned that they expect a rise in attacks. The country's president and his deputies urged security forces to intensify their efforts to secure the country. The government has blamed the ousted Baath party and al Qaeda in Iraq for Monday's attacks, saying they were meant to create sectarian divisions. The U.S. military also pointed the finger at al Qaeda. ""The nature of the attacks and targets are consistent with past al Qaeda in Iraq attacks. We see this as coordinated attack by terrorists against predominantly Shia targets that they gauge as vulnerable to instigate sectarian violence,"" the U.S. military said.","Three days of attacks in mainly Shiite areas of Baghdad leave dozens dead .

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN)  -- Fethiye Cetin was 25 years old when she discovered her beloved grandmother's secret. Fethiye Cetin, with her grandmother, said she felt deceived when she learned her origins. The little old lady in the white headscarf was Armenian. Her real name was not Seher, but Heranus Gadarian. Cetin says at the age of nine, a Turkish gendarme captain ripped Heranus from the arms of her mother while they were on a brutal death march into the desert. A Turkish couple later adopted the Armenian girl, and gave her a Muslim name. When Cetin first learned about her grandmother's Armenian origins, she was shocked. ""I felt deceived,"" she says. ""I felt like going out into the street and screaming 'they are lying to us.'"" Instead Cetin, a Turkish human rights lawyer, wrote a book titled my ""My Grandmother."" It describes the atrocities that Cetin's grandmother witnessed and suppressed since childhood. It also recounts Cetin's reunion, after her grandmother died, with Armenian relatives in the United States. The book, which has been translated into six languages, is helping chip away at a taboo in modern-day Turkey about what happened to the Armenians in the final days of the Ottoman Empire. According to the Armenian Patriarchate in Istanbul, in 1914 there were more then 2,000 Armenian churches scattered across what is now Turkey. Today, there are fewer then 50. Between 1915 and 1918, as Europe and the Middle East plunged head-long into World War I, Ottoman authorities organized mass deportations that led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Armenians living in eastern and central Anatolia.  Watch more on this story » . Every April 24, Armenians around the world commemorate the anniversary of what they call the ""Armenian genocide."" They say more then a million Armenians were killed in the massacres. The Turkish government vehemently rejects the figure. ""The people of Turkey do not believe that their ancestors were criminals, were killers,"" says Onur Oymen, a former ambassador who is now a member of the Turkish parliament. ""The historical fact says that the Armenians killed during this period more then 500,000 Ottoman citizens, Turkish citizens."" ""Regardless of whether 1,000 people were killed or one person was killed, it was still a human"" says Cetin. ""I wrote this book to say that people felt pain, people suffered in 1915 -- to look at the events from a humanitarian perspective."" The battle over history continues to claim victims. On January 19, 2007, Cetin's friend and client, Armenian newspaper editor Hrant Dink, stepped out of his office on to a busy boulevard in Istanbul to go to a nearby bank. He was gunned down in broad daylight by a 17-year-old Turkish ultra nationalist. Television cameras filmed Dink's body that afternoon, lying on the sidewalk covered with newspapers. ""Hrant Dink was defending democratization. Hrant Dink was supporting dialogue. And at the same time Hrant Dink was destroying the taboos of the system,"" Cetin said. ""Therefore Hrant Dink was dangerous for them and he was an important target."" Before his murder, Dink received a six-month suspended jail sentence for ""insulting Turkishness,"" after he wrote an essay urging Armenians and Turks to overcome their mutual distrust. He was battling another court case at the time of his death, after he labeled the massacres of 1915 ""genocide"" in an interview. He was quoted by the Reuters news agency saying: ""Of course I'm saying it's a genocide, because its consequences show it to be true and label it so. We see that people who had lived on this soil for 4,000 years were exterminated by these events."" An estimated 100,000 Istanbul residents poured into the streets in solidarity after Dink's murder, some of them chanting ""We are all Hrant Dink."" But today, his surviving son is still defending himself in court for his father's genocide comments. During his visit to Turkey this month, President Obama was asked whether he would follow through on a campaign pledge to recognize what happened to the Armenians nearly a century ago as genocide. Obama said his views had not changed on the subject, but added: ""What I want to do is not focus on my views right now but focus on the views of the Turkish and the Armenian people. If they can move forward and deal with a difficult and tragic history, then I think the entire world should encourage them."" Twenty-eight-year-old Aris Nalci, one of the new generation of Armenian journalists in Turkey inspired by Hrant Dink, said he opposed a proposed resolution in the U.S. Congress to formally recognize the Armenian genocide, arguing it would only hurt U.S.-Turkish relations. ""People and politicians in other countries are using this in a political way,"" says Nalci. ""It will not change the minds of the people walking in the streets and the people living here."" But there is one area where the tiny -- and shrinking -- community of some 70,000 Armenians still living in Turkey is praying for American help. During a short meeting with Obama, Armenian Orthodox Archbishop Aram Atesyan urged him to do everything in his power to help Turkey and its northern neighbor Armenia normalize diplomatic relations. Borders between the two countries have been shut since 1993, but the two countries have recently engaged in a diplomatic rapprochement. On April 16, Turkey's foreign minister traveled to the Armenian capital to attend a regional summit. ""Turkey is our motherland and Armenia is our fatherland,"" Atesyan explained. ""And we are like orphans, stuck in between.""","Disagreement over events in 1915 continue to divide Turks and Armenians .

"Editor's note: Nancy G. Brinker is the founder of Susan G. Komen for the Cure, named after her only sister, Susan, who died from breast cancer in 1980. The organization describes itself as the ""world's largest grassroots network of breast cancer survivors and activists fighting to save lives, empower people, ensure quality care for all and energize science to find cures."" Brinker served as Ambassador to Hungary in 2001 and Chief of Protocol of the United States during the Bush administration. Nancy Brinker says a bill by Sens. Ted Kennedy and Kay Bailey Hutchison would renew the fight against cancer. (CNN) -- During his first address to a joint session of Congress, President Obama urged a new effort ""to conquer a disease that has touched the life of nearly every American, including me, by seeking a cure for cancer in our time."" It was a call to action that resonated for me, as it's a cause I've dedicated my life to pursuing. Nearly three decades ago I promised my sister, Suzy, who died at age 36 from breast cancer, that I would do everything I could to end the disease that took her life. A couple of years later, I too was diagnosed with breast cancer, at age 37. Fortunately my cancer was detected and treated much earlier than Suzy's, and it was much smaller and not nearly as aggressive. Following a mastectomy and four rounds of chemotherapy, I am now a 25-year survivor. We have made a lot of progress since the 1980s. We now have a basic understanding of breast cancer, which is the foundation for discovering the cures. And with this new understanding, we're moving toward more personalized treatments -- as each patient and each tumor is different, their treatment must reflect those differences. Yet while we are in position to experience significant advances, the sad fact remains that we are still facing an enormous cancer crisis -- cancer will claim the lives of more than a half-million people this year -- about 1,500 people a day. In all, 40 percent of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives, including approximately 1.4 million new cases this year alone. With the graying of the Baby Boom generation, we are about to experience a cancer tsunami. Thus I was inspired to hear our new president call for reigniting our nation's war on cancer. And it didn't take long for a bipartisan group of senators to answer that challenge. The group, led by Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, and Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who have been working together and in close consultation and collaboration with the cancer community for more than a year, introduced the 21st Century Cancer ALERT (access to life-saving early detection, research and treatment) Act. This bill is an effort to address our shortcomings and renew our commitment to discovering and delivering the cures to cancer. In a period where Democrats control both the Congress and the White House and true bipartisanship is a rare and precious commodity, I am grateful to both senators, particularly Hutchison, for ensuring that this was a true partnership, and that everyone had a seat at the table. For Kennedy, this is obviously a personal issue. Hutchison has been with us in this fight since our early days, and this would not have happened without her leadership. The first step in saving lives is in detecting cancer early. If breast cancer is a guide, developing effective early detection techniques is critically important to increasing mortality rates. For example, when my sister died, only 77 percent of women who discovered their cancer before it spread beyond the breast survived at least five years. After nearly three decades of investments and advancements, the five-year survival rate has increased to 98 percent. Unfortunately, many cancers still do not have effective early detection methods. Ovarian cancer is a particularly devastating example: There is no screening diagnostic, thus a diagnosis is most often made after the cancer has spread. According to the American Cancer Society, when ovarian cancer is detected locally, the survival rate is 92 percent; however, only 1 in 5 cases are detected at this stage, dropping the overall five-year survival rate to only 45 percent. Mortality rates are even more disturbing for lung and pancreatic cancers. This has to change. This legislation seeks to address this by placing an emphasis on early detection and promoting the discovery and development of biomarkers so cancers can be detected at the earliest possible stage, when cancer is most treatable. It will also strengthen the cancer research process by promoting public-private partnerships and collaboration between government agencies. And the bill stresses translational research, so new discoveries and breakthroughs in the laboratory make their way to patients' bedsides as quickly as possible. At the same time, we have to remind ourselves as we push for science to develop the early detection methods that will save lives tomorrow, millions of our friends and loved ones do not have sufficient access to the detection and treatment methods available today. Tens of millions of people are uninsured and lack access to basic health care. Federal and state programs that provide support to underserved people with cancer are dramatically underfunded, leading to huge gaps in access. Even those with insurance often have difficulty accessing life-saving treatments, whether it is because they live in a rural community, have language barriers or are faced with roadblocks to participating in a clinical trial. The Cancer ALERT Act will begin to improve access to cancer care for underserved populations by expanding access to clinical trials and patient navigation services. One thing I've learned over this journey is that we can do anything if we just put our minds to it and show that we are committed to success. This effort is an important and promising step in showing that discovering and delivering the cures for cancer is still a national priority, and that we are committed to seeing it through. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nancy Brinker.","Nancy Brinker: I made promise to my sister who died of breast cancer .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport was back in operation late Thursday after lightning hit the control tower and severe storms knocked out power to the area. The control tower and three of the airport's five runways were open, said Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration. All systems were running on emergency generator power. A ground stoppage was already in place for arriving or departing flights when lightning struck the tower at 8:45 p.m., according to Bergen. People evacuated the tower and a smoky odor was investigated. At 9:10 p.m., the all-clear was given and controllers returned to the tower, she said. But at 9:20 p.m., the tower and parts of the airport were hit by a power outage. The outage affected all the airport's runway lights, Bergen said. During the outage, planes headed to Atlanta from other airports were being held on the ground, Bergen said, and arrivals were circling or being diverted to other airports. Atlanta's airport is one of the world's busiest.","Lightning strikes a control tower at Hartsfield airport as people evacuated .

"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- Saana Nyassi considers himself lucky. Saana Nyassi is a player for the Seattle Sounders soccer team. He is also a malaria survivor. He is fortunate not just because he has a natural talent for soccer and the dedication to rise through the ranks in his native Gambia and eventually go to the United States to play for the Seattle Sounders. Before leaving the tiny West African nation for America, Nyassi contracted malaria. ""It's a killer disease,"" the midfielder, 20, says. ""You lose appetite. You are throwing up all the time. Your body gets warm. It's very serious."" Nyassi recovered. But nearly a million people -- mostly young children and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa -- do not survive the disease, according to the National Institutes of Health. On Saturday, before their game against the San Jose Earthquakes, Nyassi and his teammates will mark World Malaria Day by giving a check for $20,000 they raised for Nothing But Nets, a U.N. Foundation-sponsored campaign to supply anti-malarial bed nets to some of the poorest parts of the world.  Watch how researchers are fighting malaria » . Nothing But Nets buys and delivers each bed net for about $10. The nets prevent mosquitoes from biting people while they sleep and passing on the parasite that causes malaria. Even though malaria was been wiped out in the United States, it still rages in countries in Africa, Asia and other developing parts of the world. ""The challenge is enormous because of the size,"" says Dr. Regina Rabinovich, director of Infectious Diseases Development at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which so far has dedicated over $1 billion to fighting and preventing malaria. Rabinovich, who also contracted malaria during a visit to Gambia, says the Gates Foundation is waging a war against the disease on several fronts. ""Keeping people from getting bitten by a mosquito, that's what a bed net does,"" she says. ""Not having the mosquito thrive, that's what insecticide does. By treating them, you keep someone else from being infected by another mosquito bite."" While malaria can be treated, getting that treatment to people suffering from the disease who are often in remote places and with little access to health care is not always easy. There is no vaccine to prevent malaria. But Rabinovich argues that cases of malaria can be greatly reduced even before a vaccine is discovered. ""The really interesting thing about malaria is that they haven't depended on a magic silver bullet,"" she explains. ""Bed nets protect you about half the time, spraying protects you. It's been the combination of prevention and treatment that's effective. When we have a malaria vaccine it will join that toolbox."" That malaria vaccine could potentially come from a temperature- and humidity-controlled vault nicknamed ""the swamp"" at the Seattle Biomedical Research Institute. There, larvae imported from India are carefully hatched into mosquitoes. Using funds from the Gates Foundation, Dr. Stefan Kappe is trying to genetically engineer the parasite that causes malaria and create a vaccine from it. With the vaccine that Kappe is working on, the malaria parasite would be unable to pass from the liver, where the parasites multiply, into the blood. ""We call this the 'you-can-check-in-but-cannot-check-out' approach,"" Kappe says. ""The immune system learns [and] is trained to recognize it -- and when the real parasite comes in, the one that can infect you, your immune system is very quickly able to eliminate it."" If it is successful, the vaccine that Kappe is formulating will aim to prevent malaria every time it is administered -- a crucial element to fighting a disease that is passed from person to person by mosquito bites. ""You need to break transmission, you need to break the ability of the parasite to move to the mosquito and from the mosquito back to humans,"" he says. ""This liver infection is a great place to attack. If you prevent infection right there, then humans don't become infected, the mosquito that bites them the next time can also not become infected and cannot bring the disease to another person."" The vaccine has already been proven effective 100 percent of the time in studies with mice, Kappe says. Now the researcher will begin human trials of a potential vaccine. Or, as he calls it, taking the difficult leap ""from mice to men."" Until there is a vaccine, prevention and remedies as simple as bed nets will be crucial. Success playing soccer means Sanna Nyassi no longer needs to be wary of malaria, but that hasn't made him forget those that do. ""I was born poor,"" Nyassi says. ""But things are getting better for me. I have to look back at the other ones.""","Professional soccer player is also survivor of malaria .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Without seeing the water, the weather, or even his own boat, Dick Lancaster  steered a 25-foot yacht to a silver medal at a sailing world championships this month. Crews from Italy and Australia do battle in the recent Blind Sailing World Championships in New Zealand. Lancaster's remarkable feat came at the recent Blind Sailing World Championships on Lake Rotorua, New Zealand. His silver medal added to two golds he has won at previous championships. The New Zealander, who gradually lost sight until he became completely blind in the last couple of years, is also the chairman of Blind Sailing New Zealand. Lancaster told CNN that sailing for the blind and visually-impaired is growing around the world. There is also hope that the sport may get its own category at the Paralympics. ""This year's event was as big as it has ever been. We had ten countries represented and most countries sent three teams."" Attendance would have been stronger had it not been for the challenging financial climate, which had prevented some nations from traveling to New Zealand for the event, he said. Since the inaugural world championships in 1992, events have been held in Australia, the U.S., the United Kingdom, Italy and New Zealand. At this world championships Lancaster was sailing in the ""B1"" class which is for the blind, while the ""B2"" and ""B3"" classes have lesser levels of visual impairment. So, how exactly do blind and visually-impaired people manage to sail a large racing boat? Lancaster explained that it is not as difficult as it may sound. ""We sail with a four man crew. There is a blind person at the helm and another blind person on the mainsheet. There is also a sighted tactician, who's not allowed to touch anything, and a fourth sighted crew member. ""The most challenging thing for me has been the last few years when I have gone from B2 to B1 (blind). You have to rely on your feel a lot more now,""he said. Even though he is unable to see, Lancaster says it's not impossible. ""There are plenty of people who sail at night-time -- so it's not too difficult."" Contrary what many may presume, Lancaster said there were not too many crashes during races, though some areas of the course were challenging. ""At the start line and when you're going around a mark it gets pretty exciting at times. There's inevitably a few prangs on the water -- but I don't know if there's any more than in other sailing."" New Zealand won the overall team trophy at the event.","The Blind Sailing World Championships were held in New Zealand this month .

"Editor's note: The following story about ""The Reader,"" by necessity, contains spoilers. If you'd rather not know about the plot, stop reading now. Kate Winslet and David Cross star in ""The Reader,"" which has received criticism from some quarters. LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- One major contender's chances at Oscar gold may be damaged due to its sensitive subject matter. ""The Reader,"" which is up for five Oscars -- including best actress (for star Kate Winslet) and best picture -- is being slammed by ""Explaining Hitler"" author Ron Rosenbaum, who's asked Academy members to shun the post-World War II drama because the film ""asks us to empathize with an unrepentant mass murderer."" Rosenbaum, who wrote his commentary for Slate.com, said that's not his only reason. ""It gives the impression that ordinary German people only learned the terrible things that happened in the death camps in the East after the war,"" he said in an interview with CNN. ""In fact, ordinary German people participated in Hitler's final solution, the extermination of the Jews -- it was no secret."" Read Rosenbaum's essay . Based on the German book with the same title, ""The Reader"" stars Winslet as Hanna Schmitz, a former Nazi prison guard living in postwar Germany. She meets and has a secretive affair with teenager Michael Berg (David Cross), who often reads aloud to her at her request. Unbeknownst to Michael, Hanna is illiterate. Their affair ends abruptly when she mysteriously disappears. Eight years later, Michael is a law student. One day, while observing Nazi war criminals on trial, he's shocked to find Hanna as a defendant in the courtroom. The court finds her guilty of killing 300 Jewish women during the war and sentences her to life in prison. While behind bars, Michael sends her books on tape, which, over time, help Hanna finally learn to read. Therein lies the problem for Rosenbaum. ""What essentially it did,"" said Rosenbaum, ""was celebrate the enrichment of a life of a mass murderer when she learned how to read. ... Imagine if there were a film about Charles Manson learning how to play chess and what a better guy it made him."" However, others in the Jewish community are applauding the film, including Ken Jacobson, deputy national director of the Anti-Defamation League. Jacobson says ""The Reader"" opens itself up to criticism, but is worthy of an Oscar at the same time. ""I think it conveys a series of messages that actually are very powerful about the Holocaust, and it's not in the usual way,"" Jacobson told CNN. ""As time goes on, as we have Holocaust deniers emerging more and more, we need people to be able to relate personally to what happened,"" said Jacobson. ""I think this film does this in a very powerful way."" The Weinstein Company, the studio behind ""The Reader,"" says it is proud of the film. ""It is sad that some people misinterpreted the film's message,"" the company said in a statement. ""It is not about the Holocaust,"" the company added, ""it is about what Germany did to itself and its future generations."" Will Rosenbaum's piece, and the backlash he touched off, affect ""The Reader's"" Oscar chances Sunday? Entertainment reporter Tom O'Neil, who follows awards shows for the Los Angeles Times' TheEnvelope.com, doesn't think so. Given ""The Reader's"" five nominations, he believes Hollywood has already embraced the film. ""Oscar has taken special notice of 'The Reader' because it's not just your average Holocaust movie,"" said O'Neil. ""It doesn't beg for forgiveness when dealing with Nazis. It makes you think."" Still, Rosenbaum says any further accolades for the drama would be unfortunate. ""I would be very disappointed in the intelligence level of Hollywood if it gave the best picture award to 'The Reader,' "" he said.","Plot of ""The Reader"" involves a former Nazi prison guard .

"(CNN) -- For most Americans, mosquitoes are pests whose bites leave behind itchy bumps. But in other parts of the world, mosquitoes carry a disease called malaria that kills more than a million people each year. Mosquitoes, especially those in Sub-Saharan Africa, may transmit malaria to humans. A new malaria vaccine that's about to begin human clinical trials is dependent on mosquitoes -- a whole lot of them. Bioengineers have been growing millions of mosquitoes in a sterile environment, letting them feed on malaria-infected blood, irradiating the bugs, extracting the disease-causing parasites and storing them for use in vaccines. The announcement of the Food and Drug Administration's approval for clinical trials comes just days before World Malaria Day, which is Saturday. Check out the World Health Organization's site about malaria goals worldwide . The vaccine is unique among other candidates in that it uses the entire parasite and not just parts of it, said Dr. Stephen Hoffman, chief executive and scientific officer at Sanaria Inc., the Maryland-based biotechnology firm developing the vaccine. This technique was first shown to be effective in the 1970s, but the technology didn't exist to mass-produce it for the millions of people who need it, said Dr.  Kirsten Lyke, principal investigator in the clinical trial site at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. At that time, people were immunized by being bitten by the irradiated mosquitoes. ""That is the only effective vaccine that anyone has ever really developed that works and does complete protection,"" said John Dame, chair of Infectious Diseases and Pathology at the University of Florida, who is not involved with the Sanaria trials. The vaccine takes the same basic approach as standard vaccines in use for diseases such as measles and polio. In those vaccines against viruses, weakened bacteria is injected, creating an immune response without causing illness. In the Sanaria vaccine, the body recognizes the malaria parasite as a foreign material, Lyke said. It goes to the liver, where a lot of the immune response is generated, but does not develop into a disease because the mosquito was irradiated, she said. Clinical trials will begin in May, Hoffman said, and will include 80 immunized individuals and 24 controls. About 3,000 mosquitoes were used to produce the vaccines for the first clinical trials, he said. If these trials are successful, researchers will initiate trials on adults in Africa, and then children. Among other vaccines in clinical trials currently, the one that is furthest along is RTS,S, developed by GlaxoSmithKline PLC. The company announced in December that this vaccine, based on a recombinant protein that uses part of the malaria parasite, was safely administered to African infants, with an efficacy of 65 percent in a three-month follow-up. Both the Sanaria and the GlaxoSmithKline projects receive support from the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative, a program at the nonprofit PATH established through an initial grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Dame, who used to be involved with the GlaxoSmithKline vaccine, said he would guess the Sanaria vaccine will be more effective, but clinical trials will provide more information. He also noted that mass distribution to developing countries would require appropriate infrastructure, and may be more difficult depending on how long the immunization lasts. Each year, 350 million to 500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most people who die from the disease are young children in Africa south of the Sahara. Symptoms of malaria include fever, chills and flu-like illness, the CDC said. Although preventive measures exist, such as insecticide-treated nets and medications, there is no licensed vaccine on the market. Moreover, effective treatments are largely too expensive for the people who need them in poor countries. The parasite has become resistant to cheaper treatments, Lyke said. ""Individuals living on $1 or $2 a day can't even afford $8 medication,"" Lyke said. The U.S. military also has a keen interest in a malaria vaccine. The antimalaria drugs available have side effects such as stomach aches, said Dr. Tom Richie, director of the Navy component of the U.S. military malaria vaccine program, who provides oversight to the clinical trials. ""Malaria has been one of the most significant infectious threats to our military personnel when we deploy to tropical areas,"" Richie said. The disease was the leading cause of casualties in the South Pacific theater during World War II, and also a major problem in the Vietnam War, he said. There are five species of the malaria parasite known to infect humans. One called Plasmodium falciparum causes the vast majority of cases. Malaria was eliminated in the United States in 1951, but there are still cases in the country, mostly from people who acquired it in high-risk countries. In 2002, there were 1,337 cases of malaria in the U.S., and all but five had been acquired abroad. An international team at the Malaria Atlas Project recently published what researchers say is the most comprehensive map ever illustrating global malaria risk. Researchers told CNN the map offers hope that it is possible to eradicate the disease in many parts of the world. Hoffman, former head of a U.S. Navy malaria vaccine team, started the Sanaria effort himself in the breakfast room of his house in 2003. The company now has a more official corporate headquarters in Rockville, Maryland. ""I thought that the world needed a malaria vaccine, there was no question this was the best way to make one,"" he said.","Sanaria Inc. is developing a malaria vaccine that uses the whole parasite .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- The FBI has begun interviewing clients of deceased Garden City, New York, lawyer William Parente as part of an investigation into his financial dealings, according to FBI spokesman James Margolin. Stephanie Parente, 19, was found dead along with her sister and parents in a Baltimore hotel Monday. Margolin said the investigation was launched at the request of police in Baltimore County, Maryland, where Parente, his wife and their two daughters were found dead in a hotel room earlier this week. ""We're looking into Parente's business interests and whether there's any impropriety there and any crime was committed,"" Margolin said. Baltimore County police say Parente, 59, killed his family before committing suicide. There have been allegations of financial impropriety in the course of the investigation, said police spokesman Cpl. Mike Hill at a news conference Wednesday. A law enforcement source told CNN a cell phone belonging to Parente was recovered in the hotel room where the bodies were found. In an attempt to locate surviving family members, investigators contacted people in the phone's directory, and some of those people said they were Parente's investment clients. The New York attorney general's office confirmed it received a complaint alleging financial wrongdoing from attorney Bruce Montague of Queens, New York. CNN spoke with Montague's law partner, Steve Drelich, who said he was speaking on Montague's behalf because Montague is distraught over the death of Parente, whom he considered a personal friend as well as a financial adviser. Drelich confirmed Montague was a client of Parente's, and said the two had known each other about six years and that Montague had been investing with Parente for about that long. Drelich said Montague's estimated losses in investments with Parente total about $450,000. Drelich said recently Montague ""got nervous and asked [Parente] for his money back,"" in light of highly publicized scandals involving other investors and financial advisers. Drelich said when Montague kept asking Parente about the money, he was told ""it was in a Canadian bank and [Parente] was having trouble getting the money back."" Montague finally received six checks late last week, Drelich said. ""Four of the six checks bounced. We were told there was no money in the account. ... We were told by the bank that the checks were bouncing,"" Drelich told CNN. Drelich said he doesn't know the amounts of the two checks that did clear for Montague. It was not until news broke about the Parente family deaths and apparent murder-suicide investigation that Montague contacted authorities, Drelich said. But Drelich emphasized that Montague was more upset with the deaths than any financial loss. ""You can always make more money,"" Drelich said. ""But Bruce is devastated about the family. He considered [Parente] a friend, but he's especially concerned about the family."" Drelich said his office received calls from at least five other people who said they invested money with Parente, with callers claiming more than $4 million in total investments with Parente. Drelich said his office referred those callers to the state attorney general's office. Baltimore County police said Parente killed his wife, Betty, 58, on Sunday, April 19, using ""blunt force trauma"" and asphyxiation. Police said he killed his daughter Catherine, 11, around the same time, using the same method. Later that day, his daughter Stephanie, 19, a Loyola College sophomore, was killed also by blunt force trauma and asphyxiation, according to police. Citing hotel records, police said the room was accessed by its electronic key at around 4 p.m. on Sunday, making it plausible that Stephanie entered the room. Later that evening, police said, Stephanie's college roommate, worried that she had an exam the next morning and hadn't come home, called the room and spoke to William Parente. Parente told the roommate Stephanie would be spending the night. Police believe she was dead at the time. Parente died some time later by cutting himself, police said, but would not elaborate further on his death.","FBI looking for financial impropriety after man's clients talked about money loss .

"LA PAZ, Bolivia (CNN)  -- An agreement aimed at ending violence and bloodshed that has erupted in Bolivian provinces has been reached between President Evo Morales and provincial governors, officials announced Tuesday. Leopoldo Fernandez Ferreira, governor of Pando province, talks to reporters a day before his arrest. The announcement on Bolivian television came just hours after the military arrested the governor of one of five provinces where violent clashes have occurred in the past three weeks, saying he had committed genocide in the deaths of 30 peasants. Gov. Leopoldo Fernandez Ferreira of Pando province was picked up at his office in Cobija and placed on a military plane for La Paz, the Bolivian capital. He did not resist. Groups in Pando and four other Bolivian provinces, backed by the local governors, have demanded greater autonomy and clashed with supporters of the federal government. Federal authorities say the 30 people who were killed Friday were federal supporters. Bolivian President Evo Morales said the arrest was legal and constitutional. ""This arrest is within the framework of the state where it happened, within the constitutional framework and no one can oppose it,"" Morales said at a news conference at the presidential palace. Officials said more arrests are possible. ""We will work day and night to avoid any more deaths or terrorist acts,"" presidential minister Juan Ramon Quintana said in another news conference. ""We will do everything we can to arrest those who have committed terrorist acts."" As news of Fernandez's arrest spread across the country, many citizens talked about who else could be on the government's ""black list,"" as they were calling it. Besides demanding greater autonomy, opposition leaders in the five provinces want the cancellation of a constitutional referendum that would give the president more power. The opposition also is angry over tax money that Morales is diverting from the provinces to fund programs for the elderly.  Learn more about the Republic of Bolivia » . Morales has said the opposition leaders are trying to overthrow the government. ""This is a coup in the past few days by the leaders of some provinces, with the takeover of some institutions, the sacking and robbery of some government institutions and attempts to assault the national police and the armed forces,"" Morales previously said. Opposition leaders say they merely want their demands met. On Tuesday, they warned that Fernandez's arrest could destroy a shaky truce with the government. The arrest came hours after Morales returned Monday night from a quick trip to Chile, where presidents of the 12-nation Union of South American Countries met to discuss the Bolivian crisis.  Watch leaders meet to discuss Bolivia » . Confronting its first crisis, the four-month-old UNASUR voted to create a commission to support Morales' democratically elected government, said Chile's president, Michelle Bachelet. She read a nine-point statement on Chilean TV that calls for the support of human rights and democracy and the preservation of Bolivia's territorial integrity. The statement condemns any attempts to overthrow the government. It also said the new commission will investigate the peasants' deaths. UNASUR is modeled on the European Union and aims to politically and economically integrate South American countries. On Tuesday, the United States announced it is organizing emergency evacuation flights for Americans in Bolivia and urged them to leave if the situation permits. A statement from the U.S. Embassy in La Paz said U.S. citizens need to sign an agreement to pay later for the cost of the flight. The embassy said some commercial flights are still available, although American Airlines suspended some flights until Sunday. The United States also continued to urge Americans to delay traveling to Bolivia. Morales expelled the U.S. ambassador last week, accusing the American government of inciting the violence. The expelled ambassador, Philip Goldberg, called the charges ""false and baseless"" and said Bolivia was making a ""grave mistake."" On Monday, the Peace Corps temporarily suspended operations in Bolivia because of ""growing instability"" there. All Peace Corps volunteers in the country have been moved to Peru. ""Our first priority is the safety and security of our volunteers,"" Peace Corps Director Ron Tschetter said in a written statement. Protests started 21 days ago in Pando, Beni, Santa Cruz, Tarija and Chuquisaca provinces. The opposition groups have blockaded major roads and threaten to disrupt the nation's natural gas shipments, particularly to Brazil and Argentina. Anti-government protesters also have clashed with police and taken over offices and buildings in the five provinces. Much of the violence has taken place in Pando, where Morales declared martial law Friday. Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous president, was elected in December 2005.","NEW: Deal aimed at ending weeks of violence .

"(CNN) -- The homeless Florida woman who made a tearful plea for help from President Obama earlier this year is still jobless and struggling financially. President Obama greets Henrietta Hughes during a town hall meeting in Fort Myers, Florida, on February 10. Henrietta Hughes caught the nation's attention in February when she cried for help during one of Obama's town hall meetings. After her plea, Hughes was given a free home to live in temporarily, but she is still struggling to find a job and might soon lose that home, CNN affiliate WINK reported Thursday. Hughes, who is in her 60s, faithfully goes to an employment center in Fort Myers in hopes of finding a job. ""It's almost our second home,"" Hughes told WINK. She and her son have taken a computer class at the center to help land work. Hughes said she has applied for as many jobs as possible but has struck out. Her son has had no luck either. Now Hughes says she feels time is running out. The home she lives in was donated by the wife of a Florida lawmaker, Chene Thompson, who has been trying to sell the vacant home in the Fort Myers suburb of Lavelle since 2006. Once the house sells, Hughes will have to leave. But Thompson told CNN that she will do everything in her power to make sure Hughes is not back out on the streets even if her house sells. ""I've told Miss Hughes ... she will never again be homeless, even if I have to personally assist her with her rent,"" said Thompson, who is a longtime advocate of the homeless. Thompson said Hughes reminds her of her grandmother and that she and her son are ""upstanding, good-hearted people."" ""Her concern is that she doesn't want to be a freeloader,"" Thompson said, but Hughes and her son have helped deter vandals who have targeted vacant homes in the area. ""They really are a blessing for me,"" Thompson said. But Hughes told WINK that she worries that she could end up living in her truck again if she has to move without a job. Her plea to Obama came as he promoted his economic stimulus plan at a town hall meeting in southwest Florida. After talking about the plan, the president opened the floor to questions from the crowd. ""I have an urgent need -- unemployment and homelessness, a very small vehicle for my family and I to live in,"" Hughes said at the time. ""The housing authority has two years' waiting lists, and we need something more than the vehicle and the parks to go to. We need our own kitchen and our own bathroom. Please help."" Hughes said her son had lost his job, leaving them homeless. Obama gave Hughes a kiss on the cheek and a promise: ""We're going to do everything we can to help you, but there are a lot of people like you.""","Homeless Henrietta Hughes made tearful plea for help from President Obama .

"(CNN) -- An adoptive mother has been charged with murdering her 9-year-old quadriplegic daughter, prosecutors in Michigan said Friday. An official says Shylea Thomas, 9,  had a ""suffocation issue"" at 3 weeks old that made her quadriplegic. Lorrie Thomas was charged with second-degree murder and child abuse in the death of Shylea Myza Thomas, said John Potbury, an assistant prosecutor with the Genesee County Prosecutor's Office in Flint, Michigan. Thomas is also charged with tampering with evidence. Thomas, who is the girl's biological aunt, made no immediate public statement. Police found the girl's body this week, stuffed inside a garbage bag in a public storage facility in Vienna Township, near Flint, said Genesee County prosecutor David Leyton. The bag was covered in mothballs ""in an apparent attempt to mask odors from the dead body,"" Leyton's office said in a news release. ""This is a very sad and tragic case that hurts all of us involved in the ongoing investigation,"" Leyton said. Shylea had not been seen in six weeks, but relatives did not report her missing until Tuesday, Leyton's office said. Thomas had been taken into custody earlier this week and held as a suspect. Because of her physical disabilities, Shylea had to use a feeding tube. She suffered from quadriplegia because of a ""suffocation issue"" in her crib at 3 weeks of age, Leyton said. Leyton said Shylea and other relatives had lived in ""absolutely filthy"" conditions. Relatives told CNN affiliate WJRT that they remember Shylea as a happy child who loved music and had an infectious smile. ""The last memory I actually have of Shylea is seeing her when she was in my care,"" said her second cousin, Josette Thomas. ""She was on the bed listening to the radio and smiling. Those are actually the memories I want to keep in my head. I don't want that memory to leave me.""","NEW: Adoptive mom charged with murder of quadriplegic girl, 9 .

"(CNN) -- Senior Bush administration officials authorized aggressive interrogation techniques -- including forced nudity and waterboarding -- on suspected terrorists, despite concerns from military psychologists and attorneys, according to a Senate report released Tuesday. The Senate report focuses on the authorization to use aggressive techniques to interrogate detainees. ""The fact is that senior officials in the United States government solicited information on how to use aggressive techniques, redefined the law to create the appearance of their legality, and authorized their use against detainees,"" said the report, which reveals new details about prisoner treatment at U.S. military prisons in Cuba, Afghanistan and Iraq. ""Those efforts damaged our ability to collect accurate intelligence that could save lives, strengthened the hand of our enemies and compromised our moral authority,"" the report said. The full report on the Senate Armed Services Committee investigation was declassified Tuesday by the Defense Department, less than a week after the Obama administration released several Bush-era memos detailing the use of such techniques. ""In my judgment, the report represents a condemnation of both the Bush administration's interrogation policies and of senior administration officials who attempted to shift the blame for abuse ... to low-ranking soldiers,"" Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, chairman of the Senate committee, said Tuesday. ""Claims, such as that made by former Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz that detainee abuses could be chalked up to the unauthorized acts of a 'few bad apples,' were simply false."" The Senate report said that in December 2001 the Defense Department's General Counsel's Office solicited information on the ""exploitation"" of detainees from the federal agency charged with training U.S. troops on how to withstand enemy interrogation techniques considered illegal by the Geneva Conventions. The inquiry to that agency, the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, was submitted more than a month before then-President George Bush signed a memo stating that U.S. military personnel ""shall continue to treat detainees humanely and, to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity, in a manner consistent with the principles of the Geneva Conventions."" The Senate committee's investigation was largely focused on the influence of a Joint Personnel program called ""Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape."" The program is used to train U.S. soldiers how to resist enemy interrogation, and employs harsh techniques such as forced nudity, use of fear, sleep deprivation and -- until last year -- waterboarding. The Senate report said Bush administration officials green lighted the use of Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape techniques on detainees -- despite warnings from military psychologists against doing so. The report includes an e-mail from an Army psychologist. ""[T]he use of physical pressures brings with it a large number of potential negative side effects ... If individuals are put under enough discomfort, i.e. pain, they will eventually do whatever it takes to stop the pain,"" said Lt. Col. Morgan Banks, the senior Army Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape psychologist, in an October 2, 2002, e-mail to personnel at the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Levin said the program is supposed to prepare troops in the event they are captured and subjected to abusive interrogations, and that it was ""never intended to be used in the interrogation of detainees in U.S. custody."" In a section titled, ""The Department of Justice Changes the Rules,"" the Senate report noted that less than a week after the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency sent the Defense Department information about the interrogation techniques, the Justice Department issued two legal opinions signed by then-Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee. The first opinion ""presented a narrow interpretation of what constituted torture under U.S. law,"" the report said. The memo said that to constitute torture, physical pain would have to match the intensity of that accompanying ""serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily functions or even death."" The opinion said the administration could defend itself against the federal anti-torture statute by arguing necessity or self-defense. The second opinion concerned the interrogation of a specific detainee, al-Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydeh, and concluded that 10 different techniques -- including sleep deprivation and waterboarding -- did not violate prohibitions against torture. Last week, the Obama administration released the second Bybee opinion -- which the Senate committee did not have access to during the investigation -- and three others written by then-Deputy Assistant Attorney General Steven Bradbury in May 2005. Bradbury's opinions concern hypothetical situations with the same interrogation techniques, as well as some others not mentioned in the 2002 memo. Those memos also conclude, for varying reasons, that the techniques did not violate prohibitions against torture. The Senate report reveals new information about Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape use on accused enemy combatants held at Guantanamo -- which President Obama plans to close within a year. ""By early October [2002] there was increasing pressure to get 'tougher' with detainee interrogations"" at Guantanamo, according to testimony cited in the Senate report from a military behavioral scientist, Maj. Paul Burney, who worked with interrogators at the facility in Cuba. So, Burney and a colleague drafted a memo proposing aggressive interrogation techniques at the facility. The scientist testified that Guantanamo's intelligence chief told him the memo needed to contain coercive techniques or it ""wasn't going to get very far,"" the report said. Levin said that despite ""serious legal concerns raised by the military service lawyers,"" Defense Department General Counsel Jim Haynes recommended that then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld approve 15 of the interrogation techniques -- including stress positions, removal of clothing, use of phobias (such as fear of dogs) and deprivation of light and auditory stimuli. After Rumsfeld's December 2, 2002, approval, senior Guantanamo staff issued a memo on the use of aggressive techniques, saying, ""The premise behind this is that the interrogation tactics used at U.S. military SERE schools are appropriate for use in real-world interrogations,"" according to the report. The report details how Rumsfeld's approval prompted interrogators in Afghanistan and Iraq to adopt the aggressive techniques. Military officials essentially copied and pasted interrogation policies from Guantanamo, and posted them as their own in Afghanistan and, ultimately, Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. In September 2003, U.S. Central Command lawyers raised concerns about the interrogation techniques authorized for Abu Ghraib, which included stress positions, sleep deprivation and exploiting fears of dogs, the report said. The report reveals a newly declassified September 16, 2003, e-mail from a CentCom lawyer, Maj. Carrie Ricci, who warned that ""Many of the techniques appear to violate [Geneva Conventions] III and IV and should not be used. ..."" Dozens of military personnel who served at Abu Ghraib confirmed that the interrogation techniques cleared by Rumsfeld had made their way to the prison, according to the Senate report. An Army dog handler at Abu Ghraib told military investigators in February 2004 that ""someone from [military intelligence] gave me a list of cells, for me to go see, and pretty much have my dog bark at them. ... Having the dogs bark at detainees was psychologically breaking them down for interrogation purposes."" The Senate report said that an interrogator told military investigators in May 2004 that it was ""common to see detainees in cells without clothes or naked"" and said it was ""one of our approaches."" Levin noted that, despite the revelation of widespread use of aggressive and abusive interrogation techniques, there is still the question of whether the senior officials who approved the policies should be held accountable. Obama on Tuesday left open the possibility of criminal prosecution, saying it would be up to Attorney General Eric Holder to decide whether to prosecute the former officials. ""With respect to those who formulated those legal decisions, I would say that is going to be more a decision for the attorney general within the parameter of various laws and I don't want to prejudge that,"" Obama told reporters. ""There's a host of very complicated issues involved there. As a general deal, I think we should be looking forward and not backwards. I do worry about this getting so politicized that we cannot function effectively and it hampers our ability to carry out critical national security operations.""","Lawyer's e-mail says, ""Many of the techniques appear to violate"" Geneva Conventions .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- French scientists have unveiled a working prototype of a fully artificial heart which is based on the technology of satellites and airplanes. The artificial heart based on satellite and airplane technology was presented in Paris. The device could save millions of lives and beats almost exactly like the real thing using electronic sensors to regulate heart rate and blood flow. Developers Carmat, funded by the European space and defense group EADS, presented the device at a press conference in Paris on Monday. Carmat's chief operating officer Patrick Coulombier told The Associated Press: ""it's the same principle in the airplane as in the body."" Coulombier explained that the same tiny sensors that measure air pressure and altitude in an airplane or satellite are also in the artificial heart. This should allow the device to respond immediately if the patient needs more or less blood. The French design has so far only been tested in animals, and now needs approval from its authorities before pushing ahead with clinical trials. Previous artificial hearts have been unable to automatically vary their pumping speed and must be tweaked externally. The French heart is also the most lifelike, with two pumps to send the blood into the lungs and the rest of the body, just like a real heart. Past artificial hearts have only had one pump. The French model is made from natural materials including polymer and pig tissue, which have already been used in heart valves implanted into people. The artificial heart would initially be for patients who had suffered a massive heart attack or who had heart failure, but might eventually be used in patients who are not that sick. Heart disease is the world's top killer, claiming some 17 million lives a year. According to the American Heart Association, about 2,200 heart transplants were performed in the U.S. in 2006. Thousands more patients would benefit if more donor hearts were available. The artificial heart is expected to cost about 150,000 euros or $192,140.","French scientists have unveiled a working prototype of a fully artificial heart .

B is for Blood stream Once a mosquito has bitten and the malaria parasites reach the liver, the parasites divide and create thousands of mature parasites. These are released into the blood and infect red blood cells.  At that point, typical malaria symptoms such as fever and anemia develop. C is for Chloroquine Until recently, Chloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, was the first option for many people because of its relatively low price and effectiveness. However, resistance to Chloroquine in many parts of the world has rendered the drug ineffective. D is for Diagnosis After noting your symptoms and travel history, your doctor will likely obtain a sample of your blood for observation. Two blood samples, taken at six- and 12-hour intervals, can usually confirm the presence of the malaria parasite and its type. It is possible to be infected by more than one parasite at the same time. E is for Epidemic According to the World Health Organization (WHO), large and devastating epidemics can occur when the mosquito-borne parasite is introduced into areas where people have had little prior contact with the infecting parasite. These epidemics can be triggered by wet weather conditions and further aggravated by floods or mass population movements driven by conflict. F is for Fever The most common symptom of all types of malarias is high fever, which is why doctors often misdiagnose malaria for flu. The fever is a reaction to toxins in the blood. It is therefore advised to tell your doctor you have been to a malaria affected zone, even if symptoms arise months after the trip. G is for Genome  In 2002, -- hundred years after it was discovered that mosquitoes transmit the malaria parasite -- the complete genetic codes of both the human malaria parasite and the mosquito that spreads it was cracked. This development brought scientists a step closer to developing drugs and vaccines to fight the disease, Nature magazine reported. H is for Hotspots Most cases and deaths are in sub-Saharan Africa, many of them occurring among children. However, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and parts of Europe are also affected. In 2006, malaria was present in 109 countries and territories. I is for Immunity Travelers from malaria-free regions such as Europe and the United States, with little or no immunity, who go to areas with high disease rates, are particularly vulnerable. It is essential to take precautions by taking anti-malarial drugs prescribed by your doctor. J is for Julius Wagner-Jauregg Julius Wagner-Jauregg, a Viennese doctor, was the first to intentionally infect syphilis patients with malaria parasites. By controlling the subsequent malaria-related fever with an anti-malaria drug, the effects of both syphilis and malaria could be minimized. Jauregg received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1927. K is for Killer Malaria is a life-threatening disease but it is preventable and curable if the right steps are taken. Education in recognizing the symptoms has reduced the number of cases in some areas by 20 percent. Recognizing the disease in the early stages can stop the disease from becoming a killer. L is for Laser gun U.S. scientists say they are developing a laser gun that could kill millions of mosquitoes in minutes. The laser fires at mosquitoes once it detects the audio frequency created by the beating of wings, the lead scientist on the project told CNN. The project is being funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. M is for Mosquitoes Malaria is caused by the bite of the female Anopheles mosquitoes. The mosquitoes bite between sunset and sunrise and parasites from the mosquito are then injected into the person's skin and transported to the liver. About 170 species of such parasites exist, but only four cause malaria in humans. N is for Nets The distribution of mosquito nets with insecticide is a very effective method of malaria prevention, and it is also one of the most cost-effective methods. These nets can often be obtained for around $3. Earlier this month, actor Ashton Kutcher won a Twitter race against CNN to reach 1 million followers. Kutcher had pledged 10,000 mosquito nets to charity if he beat CNN, and 1,000 if he lost. CNN agreed to do the same. O is for Obstacles In many endemic areas, access to health facilities, as well as drug costs, still present major obstacles. Humanitarian agency Medecins Sans Frontieres estimates that the cost of treating a malaria-infected person in an endemic country was between $0.25 and $2.40 per dose in 2002. P is for Pandemic For malaria to become a pandemic (plague) in an area, several factors have to be present: high human population density; high mosquito population density; high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. Q is for Quinine Quinine was the first effective treatment for malaria in the 17th century. Since the 1940's, many other anti-malarial drugs have appeared on the market and have taken precedent over quinine. But quinine is still being used to treat malaria in some cases. R is for Repellent The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says inspect repellents with DEET (most common active ingredient in strong insecticides) in them should be used on exposed skin and flying-insect spray can be used to kill mosquitoes in the sleeping area. DEET may be toxic, however and should be used with care. S is for Symptoms Fever is not the only symptom of malaria. Other symptoms can include shivers, headaches and nausea. Sweating and exhaustion is also common and in some cases, it can affect the brain or kidneys. T is for Tablets Malarone is a common anti-malaria drug among many travelers. It is said to have a 97 percent efficacy with relatively few side-effects. It can be given just one day before arrival in a malaria endemic country and only needs to be taken for another week after leaving. U is for Unborn child According to the WHO, pregnant women are at high risk of contracting malaria. The illness can result in high rates of miscarriages and cause more than 10 percent of maternal deaths annually. This figure can rise to 50 percent in cases of severe disease. V is for Vaccine Despite intensive research, no effective malaria vaccine has been developed to date. But according to a report in April's New Scientist journal, a unique vaccine taken from the saliva of infected mosquitoes has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to be tested in people. W is for World Malaria Day April 25 has become World Malaria Day to provide a global effort to control malaria around the world. The international malaria community only has two years left to meet the 2010 targets of delivering effective protection and treatment to all people at risk of malaria, as called for by the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-Moon. X is for X-ray X-ray microscopes are used to find the presence of malaria in red blood cells and see how they interact with healthy cells. One of the advantages of this type of microscope is that it produces very-high-resolution images of the cell structure. Y is for Yellow fever Yellow fever is another disease transmitted by mosquitoes. Some countries, such as Peru, require a certificate showing yellow-fever vaccination before you can travel there. Z is for Zanzibar Zanzibar, part of the African republic of Tanzania, has had relative successes in combating malaria; Africa's biggest killer according to the New Scientist journal. The achievements are due to the widespread use of treated bed nets, along with the switch to new anti-malarial drugs instead of Chloroquine in 2004.","World Malaria Day on April 25 highlights the danger of malaria and calls for action .
According to the WHO there were 247 million cases of malaria in 2006 .
880,000 people died of malaria in 2006, a preventable and curable disease ."
"(CNN) -- She said she was a scapegoat. She said she was just following orders. She said she was demoted unfairly. Retired Army Col. Janis Karpinski was one of two officers punished over Abu Ghraib. Now, retired Army Col. Janis Karpinski can say: I told you so. Karpinski was one of two officers punished over the aggressive interrogations at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Pictures of detainees caused outrage around the world when they were leaked to the news media in May 2004. The photos showed naked prisoners stacked on top of each other or being threatened by dogs or hooded and wired up as if for electrocution. Throughout the ordeal, Karpinski maintained that she and her troops were following interrogation guidelines approved by top brass. Today, Karpinski has found validation in a few Bush-era memos released last week by the Obama administration. ""The outrage was over the photographs, because the photographs were living color of what those top-secret memorandums authorized,"" Karpinski said in an interview Wednesday. ""So, it is unfair ... the soldiers may have moved through [the military justice] system, but they never had a fair court-martial. Not any one of them, because they were condemned as one of the 'bad apples.' "" Karpinski, then a brigadier general and commander of Abu Ghraib, was demoted to colonel because of the scandal. A second officer, Col. Thomas Pappas, the commander of the military intelligence unit assigned to Abu Ghraib when the offenses occurred, was relieved of duty and fined in May 2005. Seven low-ranking guards and two military intelligence soldiers -- described by then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz as ""bad apples"" -- were disciplined. The memo, by then-Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee and then-Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Steven G. Bradbury, allowed the use of such tactics as keeping a detainee naked and in some cases in a diaper, and putting detainees on a liquid diet. One memo said aggressive techniques such as waterboarding, sleep deprivation and slapping did not violate laws against torture absent the intent to cause severe pain. ""I will tell you that when I read those memorandums, when they were first released a few days ago, I did -- I did feel this sense of being able to exhale after five years,"" Karpinski said. ""That is what we have been saying from the very beginning, that, wait a minute, why are you inside pointing the finger at me, why are you pointing the fingers at the soldiers here? There's a bigger story here."" The Senate Armed Forces Committee released a report Tuesday, five days after the memos were released, stating that senior Bush administration officials authorized aggressive interrogation techniques on suspected terrorists, despite concerns from military psychologists and attorneys. The report points to then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's approval of such techniques -- including stress positions, removal of clothing, use of phobias (such as fear of dogs), and deprivation of light and auditory stimuli -- in December 2002 for detainees at the U.S. prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. His OK prompted interrogators in Afghanistan and Iraq to adopt the aggressive techniques. The guidance was delivered to Abu Ghraib by then-Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller, who was summoned to Baghdad from Guantanamo to evaluate the prison system. ""We had a myriad of problems in our -- in the prison system, not with detainees who were undergoing interrogations, but with Iraqi criminal prisoners,"" Karpinski said. ""And instead of coming to give us support, he was sent specifically to work with the military intelligence interrogators to teach them the harsher techniques that were being used down in Guantanamo."" Shortly before he left office in late 2006, Rumsfeld said the day the Abu Ghraib scandal broke was the worst in his tenure as defense secretary. ""Clearly the worst day was Abu Ghraib, and seeing what went on there and feeling so deeply sorry that that happened,"" he said at the time. ""I remember being stunned by the news of the abuse."" But Karpinski said the condition of detainees at the prison should have come as no surprise for the Bush administration. ""I think it was torture, absolutely. You know, I was never inside an interrogation room where they were conducting interrogations, but I read the memorandums many times over,"" she said. ""Waterboarding is torture."" Karpinski said that while she was the commander of Abu Ghraib, she didn't personally witness any of the interrogation techniques. ""The first time I saw the photographs was at the end of January [2004],"" she said. Karpinski said she was ordered by Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, the U.S. commander of operations in Iraq at the time, not to discuss the photographs or the investigation with anybody. Now, despite any relief felt by the release of the memos and the Senate report, Karpinski said she will have a hard time shaking off the humiliation and disgrace brought on by the Abu Ghraib scandal. ""I think that, you know, you cannot dismiss five years of having to live under these accusations,"" she said, ""and people associating my name and these soldiers' names with what they were so unfairly accused of."" CNN's Rick Sanchez contributed to this report.","Retired Army Col. Janis Karpinski was punished over Abu Ghraib interrogations .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Obama administration told a federal court late Friday it will maintain the Bush administration's position that battlefield detainees held without charges by the United States in Afghanistan are not entitled to constitutional rights to challenge their detention. Former detainees pray near Kaubul in 2005 following their release from U.S. custody at Bagram Air Base. ""Having considered the matter, the government adheres to its previously articulated position,"" said a Justice Department document filed in federal court in Washington. In a controversial 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court last year ruled that detainees held at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay had a right under the constitution to challenge their continued detention. However, the court did not say whether it applied to prisoners in other locations abroad, including Afghanistan. Five prisoners held at Bagram Air Base, backed by human rights groups, have gone to court to claim the same rights as the men detained in Guantanamo Bay. The new administration, which was given a month by a federal judge to declare whether the government wants to change its position, has now indicated it will continue to argue that it is against its security interests to release enemy combatants in a war zone. Barbara Olshansky, lead counsel for three of the detainee petitioners, said that the administration's decision was ""deeply disappointing."" ""We are trying to remain hopeful that the message being conveyed is that the new administration is still working on its position regarding the applicability of the laws of war -- the Geneva Conventions -- and international human rights treaties that apply to everyone in detention there,"" she said. The air base at Bagram, located north of the city of Kabul, houses between 600 and 650 detainees. Most were picked up for suspected ties to terrorism.","Justice Department: U.S. ""adheres to its previously articulated position""

"(CNN) -- Two senior Indian officials met with the Sri Lankan president Friday in Colombo to address the humanitarian crisis in the war-torn island nation. A Sri Lanka army photo of what it says are refugees fleeing a rebel area. Shiv Shankar Menon, the Indian foreign secretary and M.K. Narayanan, the national security adviser, met with President Mahinda Rajapaksa, according to A.M.J. Sadiq, a foreign ministry official in Sri Lanka. He did not provide further details. ""The Indian message was just short of reading the riot act,"" a source told CNN. Significant numbers of people have been killed or wounded in a Sri Lankan offensive against the faltering Tamil Tiger rebel movement, and thousands are trapped by the fighting, the United Nations said Wednesday. ""Given that the area has shrunk even further, the potential for further significant casualties still remains,"" the U.N. said in a statement. The Sri Lankan army launched an operation against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam in the country's northern area Monday, and a deadline for the rebels to surrender passed Tuesday. Government troops say they have rescued 39,000 civilians trapped in the area, but tens of thousands more remain wedged on the island's northeastern coast. The area remains controlled by the rebels, the U.S. State Department said Tuesday. The Tigers have been fighting for an independent state in Sri Lanka's northeast since 1983. As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began, and the group has been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries, including the United States and the European Union. Thousands of civilians remained threatened, Pranab Mukherjee, India's foreign affairs minister, said in a statement Thursday. He called for an end to hostilities in the area. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it is helping the government in the regions of Vavuniya and Jaffna, with emergency shelters and distribution of aid. There are about 38 internally displaced persons sites and authorities are working to come up with more land and buildings for more displaced people. ""UNHCR remains deeply concerned about the estimated 50,000 people who are still trapped inside the conflict zone where fighting is intensifying,"" the organization said. ""We urge the government to exercise extreme caution in its military actions and calls upon the LTTE to allow displaced people to leave the area immediately,"" the UNHCR said.","Senior Indian officials meet with the Sri Lankan president .

"Could your cell phone be bad for your health? Maybe. But not because it's zapping your brain. More homes are using just the cell phones, which limits the CDC's ability to collect health data. According to a report released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as many as one-quarter of homes in certain areas, such as Oklahoma and Utah, lack a landline and are completely reliant on cell phones. While that's terrific news for reducing the cost of phone bills, it may not be so great in terms of health-- or at least health care in general. The CDC often relies solely on landline phones when conducting large, state-based health surveys, conducted every year to determine sexual habits, childhood immunizations rates, and dozens of others factors related to American health. ""It doesn't affect health per se, rather it has implications for how well the CDC and others can track the health of the nation,"" said Stephen Blumberg, senior scientist at the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. The federal government and states often use the survey information to set national health policies aimed at reducing the number of people who lack health insurance, decreasing high-risk behavior and determining immunization rates for children and teens, Blumberg said. The CDC's report is the first to compare wireless phone-- only homes on a state-by-state basis. The new report is based on 2007 data, which found that Oklahoma had the highest percentage of cell phone--only homes (at 26 percent) and Vermont has the lowest (5 percent). There are probably more landline-free homes now, as the rate has increased by 3 percentage points each year, said Blumberg. Health.com: Cell phone study suggests people are losing their wanderlust . ""I'd expect today in 2009 the rate is probably 5 percentage points higher, perhaps even more,"" he said. Overall, about one in six American homes or about 18 percent, rely solely on wireless phones. The high rates of cell phone--only homes were not that surprising, said Blumberg. What was surprising, he noted, was the wide variation from state to state. The rates of cell phone--only homes are generally low in the Northeast; for example, Connecticut (5.6 percent), New Jersey (8.0 percent) and Delaware (5.7 percent) have low rates. In other areas, it's a different story- in Nebraska the rate is 23.2 percent, and in Arkansas it's 22.6 percent. Check your state's percentage of wireless phone--only homes. The wide variation is due to factors such as income and age. Young adults living on their own in rentals, for instance, are less likely to have landlines. ""Households in poverty or near poverty are also more likely to be wireless-only,"" said Blumberg. While missing a pesky phone call from a CDC researcher asking probing questions about your private health information may seem like a good thing, it's not, said Blumberg. ""As a result of missing all of these wireless-only households, those surveys can be biased,"" he explained. ""The potential for bias in Oklahoma is greater than the potential for bias in Vermont."" Some major, national CDC surveys are done door-to-door, but many state surveys rely on landline phones. The CDC doesn't use cell phones for a number of reasons, said Blumberg. Most callers aren't happy about using cell phone minutes to chat about a survey, and participants might want compensation for taking part in the survey. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act forbids the use of automated or computer-generated dialing to cell phone numbers. Researchers can do it by hand, but it costs more money. Researchers are considering finding ways to call cell phones or going back to an older method, in which surveys are mailed to specific addresses. It seems unlikely that Americans will be adding landlines back into the mix any time soon or ever, particularly given the added expense in a weak economy.

"(CNN)  -- A bank that received $1.6 billion dollars of the government's bailout money sponsored what reports are calling a lavish series of events in Los Angeles, California, last weekend. Northern Trust sponsored a Professional Golf Association tournament and associated client events. Northern Trust, based in Chicago, Illinois, spent an undisclosed amount of money sponsoring a Professional Golf Association tournament and associated client events, including concerts, dinners and parties, according to celebrity Web site TMZ.com. The bank spent millions of dollars on the event, which included -- on top of the sponsorship costs of the Northern Trust Open tournament -- concerts by Sheryl Crow and Earth Wind & Fire, a private party at music venue House of Blues and gift bags from Tiffany & Co., the Web site said.  Watch splashy concerts, parties » . According to TMZ.com's report, employees and clients attending the tournament dined on seared salmon and petite Angus filet and stayed at some of Los Angeles' most elegant and expensive hotels. Doug Holt, senior vice president of communication for Northern Trust, confirmed to CNN that his bank sponsored the tournament and its events but, he said, not at taxpayer expense. Holt told CNN that as a ""healthy"" bank, Northern Trust did not seek the $1.6 billion it received from the government as part of the U.S. Treasury's Capital Purchase Program, but that it ""agreed to the government's goal of gaining the participation of all major banks in the United States."" ""This is the second year Northern Trust is sponsoring the Open as part of a five-year contract,"" Holt said. The contract was signed in 2007, before the government's Capital Purchase Program to aid banks came into existence. Holt also said that the sponsorship is an ""integral part of Northern Trust's global marketing activities,"" and as with all marketing, advertising, corporate sponsorship or charitable activities, no taxpayer money was used to fund the weekend events. But that assurance doesn't seem to be enough for some. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Massachusetts, the House Financial Services Committee chairman, is writing a letter to Northern Trust asking the bank to pay back the money it spent, according to Frank's spokesman. ""We are asking Northern Trust to repay the government the equivalent of the funds they spent on the tournament and related events,"" Steve Adamske of Frank's staff told CNN. Northern Trust announced it was laying off 450 employees in December of last year, with the bank saying the move was part of a number of actions ""to better position the company for improved profitability and continued global growth during these difficult economic conditions."" Last year, Northern Trust earned an operating net income of $641 million. TMZ.com, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.","Chicago-based Northern Trust received $1.6 billion from U.S. government .

"Editor's note: Peter Bregman is chief executive of Bregman Partners, Inc., a global management consulting firm, and the author of ""Point B: A Short Guide to Leading a Big Change"". He writes a weekly column, How We Work, for HarvardBusiness.org. Peter Bregman says recession is an opportunity to reorient the focus of your working life to what you love to do. NEW YORK (CNN) -- A friend of mine, a senior leader in a pharmaceutical company, spends all her spare time doing yoga, taking classes in comparative religions, reading about spirituality, speaking with others about their beliefs. Just talking about it energizes her. Which is not how she feels about her day job. ""Why don't you leave your job and do something with this full time?"" I asked her. ""I've thought about it. But I could never make the kind of money I make now."" She might be right. But the question isn't whether she could make as much money. Even if she stays in her job she's unlikely to do that in this economy. The question is far broader and more interesting. What would her life look like -- in every dimension she values -- if she decided to pursue her passion full time? She needs to consider the contribution she'd make. The relationships she'd foster. The fun she'd have. The feelings she'd carry with her throughout the day. Her engagement in her work. In short, what her life would mean. And, of course, also the money. Which, as it turns out, might actually be greater if she were more engaged in her work. Gallup has collected data on 5.4 million employees in over 137 countries and concluded that engaged employees are more productive and customer-focused. And more profitable. Which could mean more money for her. But why are we even having this conversation during the worst downturn this country has seen in the last 70 years? Isn't she lucky simply to have a job? Yes. And, because of that, she's also stuck. For better and worse, she probably won't leave. But maybe you're not so lucky -- you've been laid off or might be soon; you're a student coming into the job market; or like several people I know, you've been thinking about a change. Well, this is your opportunity. You didn't want to risk a change when things were going well. There was too much to lose. But this downturn, this economic mess we're in, could be your chance. When everything was going well, we spent money we didn't have thinking we would make more tomorrow. Well, tomorrow came. It's easy to point a finger at Bernie Madoff (and he deserves the finger), but the truth is, it's not just him. We're all victims of our own little Ponzi Schemes. But now we know. The life we've been living, the debt we've been incurring, is unsustainable. Maybe the layoff is a favor. You were treated as expendable. But were you, working those long hours to keep a job you didn't love, treating your self as expendable too? Depressing? Sure. But now that we know, we can do something about it. I don't want to be cavalier; I know food on the table is a necessity. We still need work and money. Here are our new rules for finding it: . Rule #1: Don't spend too much time looking for your next job. As I discuss in my article for Harvard Business, ""Need to Find a Job? Stop Looking So Hard,"" searching for a job more than 1-2 hours a day will actually make it less likely you'll find one. Rule #2: Focus your time on what you're truly passionate about. Get more training. Expand your comfort zone with new activities, new people. Studies show that 80 percent of jobs are found through networking. Which is what you're doing when you pursue your passion with other people. So do it without guilt. Spend your newfound spare time doing what you enjoy with people whom you enjoy. Rule #3: Let those people know you want to make your money doing these things. Don't hammer it in. Just mention it. Once. Successful people are passionate, obsessed. And obsession isn't motivated by money. It's deeper than that. Find your obsession. Let it loose. Employers want to hire someone who is naturally driven. Self-motivated. You'll work at your obsession all the time because you want to. And that kind of persistence, that kind of focus, is worth a lot of money. But don't make the mistake of chasing the money. That's what got us into this mess in the first place. Let the money chase you. iReport.com: Brown-bagging lunch to save money? Send video . Most people are afraid to do that. Afraid of the risk. Afraid of the gap in their resume. They try to cover it up. Find ways to explain it away. But my advice to employers is hire for the gap. It's often the most interesting part of a person's life. What does a person do when they don't have anything they have to do? What do they do in their spare time? If you can hire someone for that, you'll find your star. This isn't the time to be afraid of risk. It's too late. You're already in the risk. You might not have chosen it, but why not take control and act as if you had? Remember my friend working at the pharmaceutical company -- the one with the job? By staying in work she doesn't love, she's taking a risk too. She's risking her life. Imagine how great she would be, how much she would offer, how much she would gain, if she devoted herself to her passion? Now how about you? Let's become a nation of people who love what we do.

"(CNN) -- Bulgaria is a Turkish toilet, France is always on strike, Romania is a vampire theme-park and the UK... Well the UK doesn't exist. The piece ""Entropa"" shows Romania as a giant Dracula-inspired theme park. That's the view of the European Union according to a controversial art installation by Czech artist David Cerny, commissioned by his government to mark its six-month presidency of the pan-continental body. The work, ""Entropa,"" frames various representations of each member state as components of a giant multimedia model kit. But the piece, scheduled to have its official unveiling Thursday at the EU headquarters in Brussels, has sparked controversy.  Look at images of European nations » . Bulgaria's foreign ministry has summoned the Czech ambassador in Sofia to lodge a protest about the piece, according to the Czech News Agency. What do you think about images? And Betina Joteva, spokesperson of the Bulgarian permanent representation to the EU, said in comments reported by EUObserver.com: ""It [the work] is preposterous, a disgrace. It is a humiliation for the Bulgarian nation and an offence to [our] national dignity."" Bulgaria is not the only nation to suffer an unflattering depiction. Germany is criss-crossed by a series of autobahns in what some critics say is a close approximation of a swastika; Spain is a giant construction site in a dig at its building boom; and Luxembourg is a gold covered nugget sporting a ""For Sale"" sign. The Netherlands is depicted as a submerged land with only minarets peeking through the waves in an apparent reference to its religious tensions. Poland recreates the WWII flag-raising at Iwo Jima, only with the U.S. Marines and the Stars and Stripes replaced with Catholic clergy brandishing the multi-colored gay pride flag. The UK is absent from the work -- possibly because of its on-off relationship with the rest of the continent. The Czech government said in a statement on its presidency Web site Tuesday that the original brief was for the work to be created by 27 artists representing all EU Member States -- and that it was ""unpleasantly surprised"" to learn that this was not the case. ""David Cerny bears full responsibility for not fulfilling his assignment and promise,"" said Alexandr Vondra, Deputy Prime Minister. ""In this situation we are now considering further steps. The government said it will issue a further statement Thursday. The comments were in contrast to a statement issued by Vondra Monday, when he said that ""sculpture, and art more generally, can speak where words fail. I am confident in Europe's open mind and capacity to appreciate such a project."" Cerny is no stranger to controversy. In 1991 he was arrested after painting pink a Soviet tank that served as a Prague war memorial. His Web site shows other examples of his work, including previous kit-style installations entitled ""Jesus Christ"" and ""Dead Raped Woman""; and a life-size bronze fountain that depicts two men standing opposite each other, urinating. Cerny, and his main collaborators Kristof Kintera and Tomas Pospiszyl apologized to Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek and other government ministers Tuesday, according to a statement on the artist's Web site, for "" not having informed them about what is true and for having misled them. The statement adds that Cerny and his colleagues initially wanted to use 27 European artists for ""Entropa"", but fell short due to lack of time and money. Instead, they say, they decided to create fictional artists, some of whom have even been given their own Web sites. Cerny says he knew the truth would eventually come out but adds: ""We believe that the environment of Brussels is capable of ironic self-reflection, we believe in the sense of humor of European nations and their representatives."" Try telling that to Bulgaria.","Czech Republic assumed six-month presidency of European Union this month .

Michael Bookatz as he looked when first responders arrived after he was attacked. ""Then he just suddenly ran up to me and punched me in the face,"" he said. ""He started stamping on me, kicking me. A friend of his came from the other side of the road and started stamping and kicking on me. And they said: 'This is because of what happened to the Palestinians in Gaza.'"" The attack on Bookatz -- a Jew who wears a skullcap and lives in a particularly Jewish neighborhood of London -- is one of more than 250 assaults on Jewish targets in the United Kingdom since the beginning of the year, according to the Community Security Trust, a non-governmental organization which monitors anti-Semitism in Britain. The group recorded more than 200 incidents in the month of January alone, the highest monthly total it has seen since it began keeping records in 1984. London's Metropolitan Police ""report that since December, there have been four times as many anti-Semitic attacks as attacks on Muslims, even though there are seven or eight times the number of British Muslims as there are Jews,"" said British lawmaker Denis MacShane, who chaired the country's first parliamentary inquiry into anti-Semitism. Against this backdrop, London hosted a two-day international conference on combating anti-Semitism Monday and Tuesday.  Watch what Bookatz says of the attack on him » . MacShane called it the ""first conference of its type,"" bringing together lawmakers from at least 35 different countries. ""Parliaments now have to acknowledge that anti-Semitism is back. It's a potent ideological force, causing fears to Jews in many different countries, and it has to be combated by all people that care about democracy,"" MacShane said. It is not only a problem for Jews to tackle, the lawmaker said. ""I'm not Jewish. Most people at the conference are not Jewish,"" he said. The rise in attacks on Jewish targets comes amid heightened tension in the Middle East, the Community Security Trust noted. The incidents include arson and graffiti attacks on synagogues, verbal and physical abuse of Jews, and hate mail. Similar events were reported across Europe during Israel's three-week military assault on Hamas in Gaza in December and January, the CST said in a statement. But Bookatz is not convinced Gaza is the real reason for the assaults on Jews. ""Anti-Semitism is around,"" he said. ""It has always been around. Throughout my life, I have experienced anti-Semitic attacks. ""Gaza was probably a focal point, something that triggered it: 'OK, now that Gaza is happening, we can use it as an excuse to attack people,'"" Bookatz said. MacShane said lawmakers around the world needed to take a stand against anti-Semitism. ""We would like to get the police to take anti-Semitism seriously, to take Internet anti-Semitism seriously,"" he said. ""We need to say to countries that promote anti-Semitism: 'Drop that hate of Jews.'"" He warned anti-Semitism was an indicator of other problems. ""Whenever anti-Semitism sinks roots, the world is heading in a disastrously wrong direction,"" he said. ""That is a lesson from history. If we don't tackle anti-Semitism in the early stage, then it devours democracy.""

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican authorities said they have arrested the leader of a drug cartel that set off two grenades during a public celebration in September, killing eight people and wounding more than 100. Cesar Duarte, president of the federal chamber of deputies, says he supports the government plan on narcotrafficking. Alberto Espinoza Barron, known as ""the Strawberry,"" heads the ""Michoacan Family,"" which operates in the Mexican states of Michoacan and Mexico, authorities said. Officials say the cartel set off the two grenades September 15 in the public plaza in Morelia, the capital of Michoacan. Espinoza Barron's arrest Monday, which officials did not confirm until Tuesday, came just days after Mexican officials arrested an army major assigned to a guard unit protecting Mexican President Felipe Calderon. The army major, Arturo Gonzalez Rodriguez, was paid as much as $100,000 a month for passing information to a drug cartel, officials said after the officer's arrest Friday. Espinoza Barron's arrest by the military as part of its permanent presence in Michoacan came at a time when some are questioning the military's role in the war against narcotics traffickers. ""I believe that we need to totally change our strategies since the results have been awful,"" said Juan Francisco Rivera of the Mexican Commission on National Security. ""It's not me who is saying that, because the president himself has recognized it. I don't believe the country is willing to keep committing errors."" Others believe that the military, known by the acronym SEDENA, is the only institution capable of confronting organized crime. ""The participation by SEDENA is necessary because there is a threat and harm to national security,"" said Guillermo Velasco, member of an organization called Better Society, Better Government. ""It's known that many of the successes have come from the work done by military intelligence and investigation."" Amid this debate, the secretary for national defense recently proposed a 60-year prison term for any military member linked to organized crime. ""We believe the national defense secretary's position is adequate,"" said Cesar Duarte, president of the federal chamber of deputies. ""We support him with respect to implementing major punishment for elements that are infiltrated or compromised with narcotrafficking."" In many parts of the country, narcotraffickers constantly recruit low-level soldiers. The secretary of defense has said that in the past seven years about 100,000 soldiers have quit to join the drug cartels.","Mexico arrests Alberto Espinoza Barron, known as ""the Strawberry""

"(CNN) -- Do not go backstage at Cirque Du Soleil. It will only hurt your self-esteem. Anthony Gatto says he's been in training since he was 3 years old and performing since he was 8. In the performers' tent for the touring show ""Kooza,"" there are the chiseled men catapulting their partners onto each other's shoulders from a giant see-saw and the woman doing contortions on children's-sized blocks. You can only take so much of this before your ego needs normal. Normal might be that man in the corner, wearing a T-shirt, shorts and sneakers throwing balls in the air. How hard can that be? Your self-worth will be quickly dashed again when the man picks up a soccer ball, bounces it on his head and jumps rope at the same time. Moments later, he's juggling six or seven orange rings (they move so fast, it looks like a blur) and then does a pirouette -- while all the rings are in the air -- and then catches them on his arm.  Watch the juggler in action » . You could say Anthony Gatto went into the family business. But his stepfather wasn't a farmer or a doctor. He was a juggler. ""By the time I was 8, I was entered into a juggling competition, and incidentally, that was the same competition that Patrick Dempsey, the actor, was in,"" Gatto said. ""He used to be a juggler. We competed against each other. I took first, he took second. Now he's a big actor and here I am, juggling."" Gatto is being modest. In fact, he didn't audition for ""Kooza."" The show went looking for him. ""I have right now 11 juggling world records,"" he said. ""Some of them I've held since I was 16 years old and they have yet to be beaten."" Imagine a wearable disco ball. That's not too different from the form-fitting outfit Gatto wears onstage. Backstage, it's a long-sleeve T-shirt, gym shorts and sneakers. But there's nothing casual about his daily routine. He typically works out and practices six to seven hours a day to prepare for his 10 minutes in the spotlight. In fact, he is practicing until moments before he runs on stage. ""Juggling is something that is so delicate, you have to have a really good feel, you can lose that in minutes,"" he said. ""There are so many variables that can affect you. If it's a humid day, it's a very difficult task to get through the number that I do. The wind, if there's any air current in there and you're expecting to catch a ring and it blows an inch, you miss it."" But he rarely misses -- at least not in his act. This performer, who relies on coordination and concentration 350 shows a year, admits his most embarrassing moment has nothing to do with balls, clubs or rings. It's acting that trips him up. ""I have fallen as the delivery-man character in the show. In fact, I have done this a few times,"" he said. ""I like to think it's because I put my heart and soul into the characters I'm portraying."" Surrounded by all this talent and precision, there is some comfort in knowing one of the best -- maybe the best juggler in the world -- is also a klutz.","Cirque Du Soleil's ""Kooza"" went looking for juggler with 11 world records .

"(CNN) -- For three years, the thieves crept into some of the poshest homes in the most exclusive enclaves in the nation. The gated community of Bel Air was one  of several enclaves targeted by the so-called ""Hillside Burglars."" Police said they finally have a break in the case, and wealthy residents of Los Angeles, California, are breathing a sigh of relief. ""These guys were real good,"" said L.A. City Councilman Jack Weiss, who oversees Bel Air where some of the burglaries were committed. ""They were professionals."" The thieves hauled away more than $10 million worth of valuables and cash from 150 homes in upscale neighborhoods such as Bel Air, Pacific Palisades and Beverly Hills, police said. Homes of Hollywood celebrities, professional athletes and multimillionaires were hit. According to CNN affiliate KABC, country music stars Faith Hill and Tim McGraw and former Paramount Pictures CEO Sherry Lansing were among the victims. DNA evidence led the LAPD to suspected ringleader Troy Corsby Thomas, 45, of Los Angeles. He was arrested near L.A. International Airport last weekend. Police say Thomas led a gang dubbed the ""Hillside Burglars"" that targeted the neighborhoods overlooking Sunset Boulevard. ""It's a very euphoric, satisfying feeling that we got this person,"" said the police Lt. David McGill. ""It's a very frustrating feeling to tell the victims, 'I'm sorry I don't have any news for you.' Finally when we got some good detective work and breaks, things started lining up."" Police are looking for more suspects linked to the three-year spree but are not naming them. Thomas is being held on $2 million bail, according to the L.A. County District Attorney's Office. He is likely to stay in custody because he must reveal the origin of any funds used to pay the bail, authorities said. At a court appearance Tuesday, Thomas pleaded not guilty to two charges of residential burglary, one in January 2006 and another in March 2008. The preliminary court date for Thomas will be set on January 29 and additional charges are expected to be filed, according to CNN affiliates KABC and KTLA. Police will not comment on Thomas' background. The Los Angeles Times reported that Thomas told police he had been working as an auto broker. The Hillside Burglars have not struck since Thomas' arrest, police said. ""Hallelujah!"" said L.A. Councilman Bill Rosendahl, whose district includes Brentwood and Pacific Palisades. ""Even a crafty crook does make his mistake and that's what happened to this one."" Some residents are cautiously optimistic. ""We're delighted,"" said Robert René, president of Brentwood Homeowners Association, which represents about 800 homes. ""We are very fortunate to have the due diligence of the Westside LAPD."" Harvey I. Saferstein, president of the Bel Air Association, agreed, ""We are all obviously thankful and relieved."" The financially strapped LAPD created a Hillside Burglars task force. People donated cameras and other equipment and police stepped up patrols. The outlay amounted to ""millions of dollars,"" Rosendahl said. Neighborhood watch groups formed. One in Bel Air donated $8,000 for infrared cameras that can spot burglars in the dark. Robert Ringler, president of the Bel Air Beverly Crest Neighborhood Council, hosted a community meeting with the LAPD at the five-star Bel Air Hotel a year and a half ago. As swans swam in ponds in the background, about 150 Westside residents sipped Perrier and vented their fears. ""It had gotten to be such an epidemic,"" Ringler said. The impressive mansions -- usually gated and hidden by walls and hedges -- dot the lush hillsides and canyons between the coast and the mountains. The qualities that make them so desirable also make them vulnerable. The seclusion that appeals to upscale homeowners also appeals to thieves. Because many of the homes are tucked into the sides of mountains and canyons, behind gates, it's easy for a thief to escape unseen and hard for police to get there quickly. ""It's the perfect target,"" Ringler said. ""You can access the property and nobody would ever see you."" Frequently, maids, pool workers and gardeners have access to the property, which allows burglars to pass as the help and slip in unchallenged. According to police and media reports, the methods were sophisticated. Burglars waited till homeowners went on vacation or out for the night. They used lawn furniture and ladders to creep into the second floor, which often lacked alarms. They quickly went in, looked for jewelry, safes and cash, and ducked out with the goods. They never attacked any of the homeowners, preferring stealth to confrontation. Residents say they learned to keep jewelry and other valuables in safety deposit boxes and out of sight. Many added alarm systems and insured their belongings. ""It's not just about money,"" said Robin Stevens, who lives with her husband and son in Brentwood. ""A lot of people lost things of sentimental value."" Stevens, whose neighbors have been burglarized,  said she feels safer knowing that police arrested Thomas, but will continue hiding her mother's antique jewelry and locking the windows. During a two-week trip to the South Pacific last fall, Stevens made sure to e-mail her neighbors, notifying them that she would be gone so they could look out for strangers. Other residents remain skeptical. Pacific Palisades Community Council Chairman Richard G. Cohen said he feels relief but is waiting for a conviction. ""The arrest doesn't mark the end of our concern,"" he said. With the economy in a tailspin, Steve Twining, who serves on the West Los Angeles Police advisory board, believes thefts will continue. ""In these dire economic times, I don't think it's going to dissuade others from trying to do the same thing,"" he said. ""The burglary situation will probably get worse before it gets better.""","Wealthy Bel Air, Beverly Hills residents feel cautious relief .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In the wake of a highly publicized chimpanzee attack, the U.S. House made its first official move to ban humans from owning primates as pets. Travis, seen here as a younger chimp, was fatally shot by police after attacking a woman, authorities say. The House overwhelmingly voted in favor of passing the Captive Primate Safety Act on Tuesday, which prohibits people from buying or transporting primates across state lines to keep as pets. This legislation amended the Lacey Act, which had only applied to wildlife and fish. The Humane Society of the United States applauded the bill, which passed by a vote of 323 to 95. ""There is no reason for any private citizen to keep a primate as a pet, and this trade is driven by unscrupulous dealers who sell primates across state lines for thousands of dollars,"" said Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of the HSUS. Last week, Charla Nash, 55, was left with severe trauma to her face, scalp and hands after her neighbor's pet chimpanzee, Travis, mauled her in Stamford, Connecticut. Police shot Travis to halt the attack, and he later died of gunshot wounds. Nash was brought to the famed Cleveland Clinic, where the nation's first face transplant was performed. Doctors there are contemplating whether to offer her a similar procedure. The bill was introduced by U.S. Reps. Earl Blumenauer, D-Oregon, and Mark Kirk, R-Illinois, who said it would protect animals and humans from similar attacks. ""As the tragic attack in Connecticut shows us, The Captive Primate Safety Act is necessary, common-sense legislation for the welfare of humans and animals,"" Blumenauer said. ""Make no mistake, this bill will protect communities and ensure the humane treatment of these animals."" ""It is inhumane to cage primates in private homes. Besides the animal cruelty concerns, the interstate movement of pet primates creates serious public health and safety risks. The Captive Primate Safety Act takes important steps to address these concerns,"" Kirk said. As cute as they can be, primates can inflict serious injuries and spread life-threatening disease, according to the Humane Society. The average pet owner cannot provide for their basic social and physical needs in captivity, says the organization, which estimates 15,000 monkeys and other primates are living as either pets or in private zoos. ""As infants, they are fascinating,"" said Beth Preiss, who directs the organization's Exotic Pet Campaign. ""But they grow up and become dangerous to manage."" The bill moves now to the Senate, where Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer of California and Republican Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana will lead the effort to pass the legislation. CNN's Lauren Kornreich contributed to this report.","Bill prohibits purchase, transportation of primates across state lines .

"(CNN) -- David Beckham was upstaged on the day his AC Milan future was finally resolved as teammate Filippo Inzaghi fired a hat-trick in the 3-0 success over Atalanta at the San Siro on Sunday. David Beckham congratulates hat-trick hero Filippo Inzaghi as the San Siro enjoys a double celebration. Milan confirmed in a brief statement a deal had been reached with Los Angeles Galaxy over England international Beckham. ""AC Milan announces that the player David Beckham will remain at the club until June 30, 2009,"" it read. The 33-year-old midfielder will then return to the United States to play for the Galaxy between July and October. ""I'm grateful to both clubs for allowing this dream to come true,"" Beckham said in a statement posted on www.gazzetta.it. What do think of Beckham's move to play in the U.S. and Italy? ""It will enable me to play for Milan and the Galaxy in the same season, with the possibility of been able to keep up my commitments with Major League Soccer and the development of soccer in the United States, something which I'm very passionate about."" The deal follows weeks of negotiations between the two clubs during which Milan baulked at the size of the transfer fee Galaxy were demanding -- thought to be around £12million. Galaxy's chief executive, Tim Lieweke, admits the deal is one which suits both clubs. ""I'm sorry that it had to go for so long, for him and for us and particularly for the fans,"" he told the Los Angeles Times. ""This is a good solution. It allows him to finish the season with Milan. We will see him in July."" Coach Carlo Ancelotti admits Beckham has exceeded all expectations during his first two months as an AC Milan player. ""Beckham has done more than we could have possibly expected from him,"" Ancelotti told PA Sport. ""He has settled in very well with the squad and given a huge contribution up to now. ""He is very professional and we are all very, very happy that he is staying."" He added: ""The aim was to keep him until June 30 and we have done that. He is very happy with the solution that has been found and we will make the most of having him now and then we will see."" Sunday's victory gave Milan a five-point gap over fourth-placed Fiorentina, who lost 2-0 at home to Palermo. Ancelotti said Inzaghi had helped lift the club out of a crisis after their UEFA Cup exit. ""He gave us a real helping hand. It was a tough match and for most of the first half Atalanta caused us problems,"" he said. ""Then Pippo's ability to find the right place to be in allowed us to end the match well. We were in a crisis and now I hope that this result has put an end to the crisis."" Only the top three in Serie A will go straight into next season's Champions League group stages with the fourth place finisher having to negotiate two qualifying rounds. With his contract uncertainty behind him, Beckham seemed to have a new lease of life and he was even given a free role behind forwards Inzaghi and Pato by Ancelotti. The former England captain dictated the play and helped open the way for Milan to take a seventh-minute lead when Marek Jankulovski firied across goal for the unmarked Inzaghi to score. Milan had to wait until the 71st minute for Inzaghi's second. He beat the offside trap to latch onto Pato's chip and take the ball around Consigli before slotting home. Moment's later Inzaghi was once again in the right place at the right time to tap in Gianluca Zambrotta's pass from close range. After that Ancelotti took both Inzaghi and Beckham off to give the fans the chance to show their appreciation for both players. There was no change to the top three in Serie A as Inter Milan and Juventus both won on Saturday, 2-0 at Genoa and 1-0 at Torino respectively. Serie A top scorer Marco Di Vaio also scored a hat-trick as Bologna thrashed Sampdoria 3-0.","Filippo Inzaghi fires hat-trick in Milan's 3-0 win over Atalanta at the San Siro .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN)  -- Gas will resume flowing ""in the next few days,"" Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told reporters following summit talks in Moscow aimed at resolving the ongoing dispute between Ukraine and Russia which has left many parts of Europe without natural gas. Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko was in Moscow Saturday for talks with Russian leaders. Medvedev said the summit talks, which also involved Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and her Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, had raised a number of ""interesting ideas,"" including loans and extensions of credit aimed at resolving the crisis. But he reiterated that no agreement had been reached. Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov said the meeting highlighted Russian efforts to enlist major European gas companies as a part of an international consortium that would subsidize Ukrainian payments to ensure gas deliveries from Russia. ""Preliminary willingness (to join the consortium) has been stated by Eni, which was the first to do so, then by Ruhrgas, Wingas, Gaz de France, OMV, and Gasterra,"" Kupriyanov told Russian news agency Interfax. On Friday, Putin said Ukraine required about $730 million of ""technical gas"" to resume export deliveries from Russia. It has now been 11 days since much of Europe was cut off from crucial supplies of Russian natural gas because of the dispute between Russia and Ukraine, which is in charge of pipelines carrying gas to the continent. The taps remain shut despite a deal signed in Brussels earlier this week. The European Union has tried to pressure Russia and Ukraine into sorting out the matter, calling into question their reliability as energy suppliers. Russia has said the dispute is not bilateral. Tymoshenko said ahead of the trip that her top priority was to resume Russian natural gas transit to Europe in order to protect Ukraine's reputation as a transit country and prevent the empty pipelines from suffering damage as a result of being idle.  Watch how a simple price dispute led to the crisis » . ""The government takes full responsibility for resolving the crisis in relations with Russia, which was not initiated by us,"" Tymoshenko said in a statement on the government's Web site. The prime minister said she would press for direct relations between Russian energy giant Gazprom and Ukraine's state-run gas company Naftogaz and ""mutually beneficial prices"" for gas and transit. It was prices and cost that caused the problems in the first place. Russia cut off Ukraine's domestic gas supply at the start of the year, claiming nonpayment of debt, and the two sides failed to agree on the terms for a new contract. Six days later, in a move each side blamed on the other, Russian gas supplies to Europe via Ukraine were turned off as well.  Watch how Slovakia has been affected by the gas row » . ""There is the need to compromise in order to preserve friendly relations between Ukraine and Russia, and to uphold the reputation of both countries in Europe,"" Tymoshenko said.

"(CNN) -- Roll out the pink carpet, grab a feather boa and throw open those Malibu Dream House doors. It's Barbie's 50th, and the iconic doll, unveiled today in her latest swimsuit, has plenty to celebrate. The classic 1959 Barbie strikes a pose in front of an early Malibu Barbie Camper. Only this American institution could have inspired Barbara Karleskint, 48, to spend nearly $700 so she and one of her dolls could wear matching red chiffon gowns and capes at an annual collectors gathering. ""Look, we're not as bad as the Star Trek convention people,"" Karleskint, who lives outside of Orlando, Florida, said with a laugh. Collecting Barbies ""brings me joy; that's all I can say. And life's not worth living unless you have some joy."" With 8 million active collectors dotting the globe, according to Mattel, Karleskint is hardly alone. Since Mattel introduced Barbie in 1959, she has become a household name -- owned by 90 percent of American girls ages 3 to 10 and sold in 150 countries, said Lauren Dougherty, a Mattel spokeswoman. Barbie attracts 50 million visitors to her Web site each month, she added. See Barbie dolls from all over the world » . Along the way, she spawned a cosmetics line, apparel stores throughout Asia and an entertainment franchise that has sold more than 65 million DVDs.  Watch old toys get new life » . Last week, a six-story flagship store opened in Shanghai, China. And a real-life Malibu Dream House, a temporary home tricked out for Barbie's birthday -- including a chandelier made of her hair -- is currently on display in California. Not bad for a doll that, according to author Robin Gerber, was initially inspired by ""a sexually-themed gag toy for men."" The now-legendary doll was conceived by Ruth Handler, a daughter of Polish immigrants, said Gerber, author of the newly published ""Barbie and Ruth: The Story of the World's Most Famous Doll and the Woman Who Created Her."" She and her husband, Elliott, owned Mattel until a scandal involving accusations of cooked books drove them out in 1975, Gerber said. Handler, who died in 2002, used to watch her own daughter, Barbara, play with paper dolls. Then, on a trip to Europe, Barbara became fascinated with a buxom doll that Gerber said was based on a female German cartoon character, named Lilli, who used sex to get what she wanted. ""My guess is she didn't know what it was when she bought it,"" because at that point, four years after the Lilli doll's release, it had landed in European toy stores, the author explained. Handler took the doll back to the states and insisted Mattel designers get to work. ""Who would have thought,"" Gerber said. Barbie was thought up by a woman and modeled on a cartoon character ""who was essentially a prostitute."" Though the men at Mattel, a company that had never sold dolls before, were skeptical at best, Handler proved to be ""a corporate genius,"" Gerber said. In the three years after Barbie's release, Mattel's worth grew to $200 million, doubling the value earned in the first 20 years of business. Handler's daughter, now Barbara Segal, 67, is a bit dumbfounded by all the hype. ""It's been quite an interesting ride,"" she said from her Los Angeles, California, area home. ""I can't believe this doll's created all of this."" Barbie's collector line (not what's seen on Wal-Mart shelves) is designed for the grown-ups who still relish Barbie. Many say Barbie is an antidote to adult woes, allowing them to recapture their youth and revisit simpler times. iReport.com: See, share Barbie collections . The woman behind Sandi Holder's Doll Attic in Union City, California, strolled through her 3,000-square-foot warehouse and one-of-a-kind Barbie museum, home to thousands of dolls, and spoke of the visitors who flock through her doors each year.  Tour an iReporter's Barbie dream house » . She says the doll can evoke powerful emotions and has seen visitors weep for a lost sibling or childhood friend. But Holder, 51, who gave up a nursing career to pursue her Barbie dream more than 20 years ago, said that while trips to the museum can be emotional, they're also full of laughter and stories. ""No one leaves without sharing a fond portion of their childhood with me,"" said Holder, who once snagged a record for selling a doll at auction for $27,600. Barbie, however, doesn't conjure up smiles for everyone. Though the 11.5-inch doll can't be single-handedly blamed for the eating disorders and body-image issues that plague young women, Ellyn Kaschak, a psychology professor at San Jose Sate University in California, said Barbie, especially given her prevalence, is part of the problem. ""I don't think the concerns are overblown at all,"" said Kaschak, one of the founders in the 1970s of the feminist psychology field. ""Blow her up to normal [human] size, and she'd fall over,"" she said of Barbie's unattainable figure. Still standing, however, is Cindy Jackson, a 53-year-old woman inspired by Barbie to do much more than collect dolls and splurge on matching outfits. Over the course of more than two decades, Jackson has gone under the knife for 13 full-scale operations, including multiple procedures each time, and hundreds of less intrusive cosmetic tune-ups in order to achieve the ""all-American beauty"" look she said Barbie represents. She grew up in rural Ohio, ""plain and unpopular,"" she said. ""Every real woman around me was a farmer's wife, a factory worker, a mother or a school teacher. ... For me, it was soul-destroying. There was no glamour whatsoever."" And then she met her first Barbie, a vintage doll sporting a bubble cut, ""a sidelong glance"" and dressed as Jackie Kennedy, she remembered. ""It was powerful,"" Jackson said from her London, England, home. ""I'd never seen a real woman who looked like that, and I thought, 'That's what I want to look like.' "" Concern about Barbie's looks and her values, including materialism -- she has worn about 1 billion outfits, Mattel's Dougherty said -- has at times gained ire from more than feminists and psychologists. The recent release of Tattoo Barbie, for instance, has gotten under the skin of some parents.  Watch video about the controversy » . But such criticism misses the point of what Barbie is all about, according to diehard fans. iReport.com: Barbie's body is not the issue . ""It's not about wanting to look like her. It's about imagining what could be,"" said Nancy Parsons, of western Pennsylvania, who is chairwoman of the Barbie 50th Anniversary Gala, this year's collectors convention planned for July. ""People who say it's a bad influence -- they don't know the imagination that goes into playing with dolls. ... My sister always pretended she was a nurse, and [now] she's a nurse."" All told, Barbie has held down 108 careers, Mattel says. She's been a police officer, a doctor, a veterinarian, an astronaut and a presidential candidate. Women, by the way, are not the only ones drawn to Barbie. Up to 20 percent of annual convention attendees, who fly in from all over the world, are men, this year's chairwoman, Parsons, said. In her own collector's club there are two of them: ""One's a hair dresser, and one's an auto mechanic,"" she said. Scott Warren, 45, of Orlando, Florida, will attend his seventh consecutive annual convention this summer. The ""novice fashion fan,"" as he described himself, has been collecting Barbies for about 14 years and counts among his favorites his Versace Barbie, Ralph Lauren Barbie and Diane von Fürstenberg Barbie. ""I know there's no way I can afford a designer's original, but I think it's cool that my Barbies can,"" he said.  See photos of Barbie dolls in designer clothes » .

The officials said 127 A-10 Thunderbolt IIs, including some used in the United States, will be grounded until they are each inspected for the cracks. ""The inspections are a necessary step in addressing the risk associated with A-10 wing cracking, specifically with thin-skin wings. This risk is of great concern to the Air Force and is representative of a systemic problem for our aging Air Force fleet,"" the Air Force said. The A-10 Thunderbolt II, nicknamed the ""Warthog"" because of its unique un-aerodynamic look, is one of the Air Force's older aircraft, having first been delivered to the service in 1975. The average age of the A-10 fleet is now 28 years, but the entire Air Force fleet has an average age of 25 years, according to Air Force statistics. The Air Force has more than 400 A-10s in its fleet. The cracks in the older A-10 A-models and A-10 C-models were discovered at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during routine maintenance. No A-10 has had an accident because of the cracks just discovered, according to Air Force officials. The inspection of the 127 planes will give priority to the planes in the Iraq and Afghanistan theaters of battle, officials said. The plane was designed as a tank killer, with a front-mounted Gatling gun that fires 30-mm armor-piercing ammunition capable of destroying a tank. The planes are now primarily used in Iraq and Afghanistan to protect ground troops in close combat situations, flying low and slow and with the ability to target individuals hidden on mountainsides or rooftops. Last year, the Air Force grounded hundreds of F-15 fighter jets after one fell apart during a training mission. The culprit was a fatigued longeron, a part that holds the fuselage together. Numerous F-15s flying in Iraq and Afghanistan also were grounded until they were inspected, forcing the service to fly other aircraft in their place. The Navy was also asked to help cover the F-15 missions during the weeks they were grounded.","127 A-10 Thunderbolt IIs will be grounded because of fatigue cracks in wings .

"(CNN)  -- The entire population of Taloga, Oklahoma, was evacuated Thursday because of a raging fire that has burned tens of thousands of acres, officials said Friday. Wildfire threatens a house in Edmond, Oklahoma, on Friday. All of the residents, about 400, left the Dewey County town, but have been allowed back in, said Bill Challis with the fire department in Clinton, Oklahoma, south of Taloga. Clinton is among dozens of fire departments helping battle the blaze. Wildfires have been burning in northwest and central Oklahoma since Thursday, according to the state Department of Emergency Management. A large wildfire also came within inches of homes north of Edmond late Friday morning and was still burning during the noon hour, CNN affiliate KOCO reported. Oklahoma Department of Public Safey officials also report that one to two city blocks of Weleetka, in Okfuskee County, were on fire, according to KOCO. The Federal Emergency Management Agency  has approved the state's request for federal assistance for  fighting the wildfire in Dewey County, where Taloga is located. The original call about the Taloga fire came in Thursday at about 12:30 p.m. (1:30 p.m. ET), Challis said. Officials don't know how the fire started. Brett Russell, also with the Clinton Fire Department, said about 60,000 acres have burned. There are no reports of anyone injured. As of about 11 a.m. Friday (12 p.m. ET), the Taloga fire was about 50 to 60 percent contained. About 80 fire departments helping battle the blaze, Russell told CNN.

"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- The United Arab Emirates has refused to grant a visa to a female Israeli tennis player, preventing her from competing in the Sony Ericsson World Tennis Association Tour in Dubai, the WTA said in a statement Sunday. The UAE has refused to grant a visa allowing Shahar Peer to compete in Dubai. Shahar Peer would have been the first Israeli athlete to participate in a professional sporting event in the UAE, CNN Sports correspondent Pedro Pinto said. The UAE has no diplomatic ties with Israel. Peer told CNN on Sunday evening she was ""very, very disappointed"" to be denied access to the tournament. ""Any player that qualifies should attend, and I was prevented,"" she said from Israel. ""I'm glad the WTA support me. A red line was crossed for every athlete in the world -- politics should be kept separate from sports."" The governing body of women's tennis said it was ""deeply disappointed"" that Peer was being denied entry to the country hosting the tournament, but it did not cancel the competition, which began Sunday. The move runs counter to WTA policy, which says no player should be barred from competing in a tournament for which she has qualified. Dubai could lose its membership in the WTA tour next year over the ban on Peer, according to WTA rules. That would mean professional players could compete only in exhibition matches in Dubai, the results of which would not count in pro rankings. Government officials in Dubai have not responded to CNN's request to comment over their refusal to allow Peer to compete in the event. ""Ms. Peer has earned the right to play in the tournament, and it is regrettable that the UAE is denying her this right,"" said Larry Scott, chairman and chief executive of the tour.  Watch Scott express disappointment » . ""Following various consultations, the tour has decided to allow the tournament to continue to be played this week, pending further review by the tour's board of directors."" The patron of the Dubai Tennis Championships is Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Makhtoum. Two million dollars in prize money is on the line. Al-Makhtoum told CNN in 2004 that Dubai would accept Israeli students to a school dedicated to students from the Middle East who are talented at sports. In 2003, Dubai hosted World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings, which Israeli government officials attended. The Israeli flag -- among other member states' flags -- is still part of a globe monument in Dubai. Peer, 21, is ranked 48th in the world among female tennis players. She was allowed to compete at the Doha tournament in Qatar last year, where she received a warm welcome, according to Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz. Qatar, another Gulf Arab state, froze diplomatic ties with Israel after Israel's military offensive in Gaza last month. Peer downplayed the political undertones of her participation in last year's Doha tournament, telling Haaretz that she didn't come to Qatar ""to help the politics of course."" But she added that if her playing in the tournament ""can help for peace or anything, I'd be really happy."" Scott said the tour will ""review appropriate remedies for Ms. Peer"" as well as ""appropriate future actions with regard to the future of the Dubai tournament."" Peer was advised Saturday by tournament and WTA officials of the denial of her visa while she was participating in a tournament in Pattaya, Thailand, according to a WTA statement. The Dubai Tennis Championships runs through February 28.","NEW: Shahar Peer, female Israeli tennis player, says she's ""very, very disappointed""

"(CNN) -- The pilot of a tanker that crashed into the San Francisco Bay Bridge in 2007, causing a major oil spill, was under the influence of multiple prescription medications that impaired his judgment, federal officials said in a report Wednesday. The November 2007 crash left a gash in the tanker's side and led to an oil spill that killed more than 2,000 birds. The National Transportation Safety Board said the pilot of the Hong Kong-registered Cosco Busan, was ""medically unfit"" on November 7, 2007. That, and a master pilot's poor oversight of his performance, were major factors in the crash that dumped 53,000 gallons of oil into the bay, the NTSB said. ""How a man who was taking a half-dozen impairing prescription medications got to stand on the bridge of a 68,000-ton ship and give directions to guide the vessel through a foggy bay and under a busy highway bridge is very troubling,"" said acting NTSB Chairman Mark V. Rosenker. The pilot, John Cota, was charged with criminal negligence in federal court last year. He faces two misdemeanor charges that could result in up to 18 months in prison and $115,000 in fines. The 901-foot ship left Oakland, California, en route to South Korea when Cota gave orders that steered the ship directly toward a support tower on the bridge. While the ship avoided a direct hit, it hit a support system at the tower's base, cutting a 212-foot gash in the ship's side, the NTSB said. The board ruled that Cota and Chinese master pilot Mao Cai Sun never thoroughly discussed a plan before they took off on a foggy night when visibility was less than a quarter-mile. The oil spill killed about 2,500 birds of 50 different species, according to the report. The crash caused more than $70 million in environmental cleanup costs, $2 million in damage to the ship and $1.5 million in damage to the bridge. The report also blamed the ship's operator, Fleet Management Ltd., for not properly training crew members and the U.S. Coast Guard for not providing adequate medical oversight of the pilot. It said the Coast Guard should have revoked the pilot's license, the pilot should have given a meaningful pre-departure briefing about plans for the voyage and the master pilot should have taken a more active role in ensuring the ship's safety. ""There was a lack of competence in so many areas that this accident seemed almost inevitable,"" Rosenker said.","Pilot of tanker that struck San Francisco Bay Bridge ""medically unfit,"" NTSB says .

"BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- A huge mural greets visitors to the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center in Boston. It's a memorial to the building's namesake, who died unexpectedly in 1993. Hundreds of tiles are used to create the ""magic"" mural at the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center in Boston. A young Reggie Lewis, wearing his  No. 35 Boston Celtics jersey, dominates the middle of the 11-foot-by-14-foot artwork. At the bottom left is a picture of him and his wife. To his right, the face of legendary Celtic Larry Bird. But as young men in sweats and sneakers make their way into the gym, something strange happens. The mural comes alive. The photo of a beaming Lewis in formal attire transforms into Lewis the basketball player, streaking down the court. Larry Bird's picture morphs into that of another famous player, Robert Parrish. With each step, the mural transforms, representing the many scenes in one man's life. Artist Rufus B. Seder calls these ""movies for a wall"" Lifetiles. The Massachusetts artist invented the Lifetiles medium and is the only artist in the world using it. He has more than 30 Lifetiles installations around the globe.  Watch a magic mural in action » . At the Taiwan Aquarium, dolphins swim on the wall alongside awestruck children. Bucking broncos line the halls of the the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas. Dancers spin and twirl along with passengers on luxury cruise ships in the south of France. And Seder calls the the South San Francisco, California, BART station his ""own personal gallery,"" with more than 16 installations. Lifetiles don't use electricity, moving parts or tricky lighting -- just an elaborate and painstaking process done out of Seder's Eye Think Inc. studio near Boston. ""What I'm after is trying to create an experience which totally takes you by surprise,"" he said. Scanimation on the shelf . If the technology you see in Lifetiles looks familiar, you might have caught something similar at a local bookstore. The popular children's books ""Gallop!"" and ""Swing!"" were also written and illustrated by Seder. With a technique he calls scanimation, pictures in the books come alive as you flip the page. It's a kids' favorite that quite a few parents enjoy, too, based on sales numbers. ""Swing!"" and ""Gallop!"" are currently on The New York Times bestseller list. Seder originally used scanimation in greeting cards he sold at trade shows around the country. Then Workman Publishing came calling, asking Seder to develop a book based on the eye-catching technique. That's when Seder caught lightning in a bottle. After several decades as a somewhat unknown artist, he found himself flying to China to teach the scanimation technique to book makers. Just a few years later, there are over 2 million copies of ""Gallop!"" in print in more than 13 languages. Still awed by their popularity, Seder said, ""I would've been satisfied if a limited edition sold well. It totally blew my mind what happened."" Although his books' success have gained Seder some newfound publicity, the Lifetiles are truly his life's work. The relatively unknown and seemingly modern form of art isn't new at all. Seder's been working on Lifetiles for more than 20 years, inspired by toys from the 1850s called zoetropes and an active imagination as a youngster. ""I started making movies when I was 12 years old,"" he said, ""so I was always into motion pictures and especially into optical tricks and techniques that trick the eye."" How does it work? As a viewer, you don't have to learn how to see a Lifetile. It's intuitive, and one immediately understands the concept. As you walk past the mural, it begins to move along with you. But the question that immediately comes to mind -- and the one Seder gets the most -- is, ""How does it work?"" ""The short answer is, it's magic,"" Seder said. ""The longer answer is, it's like a flipbook. I've taken all the pages from a flipbook and scrambled them all together, and I've put them up on the wall and made them animate."" The lengthy process also requires attention to detail. Much like an animator, he creates a series of drawings on his computer. He then strips down each image into what becomes an indistinguishable picture made up of a series of vertical lines. This squiggly-lined image becomes the equivalent of a photo negative. The negative gets sandblasted onto a hand-cast glass tile made in Seder's studio. The heavy, 8-inch-square glass tiles get painted, scraped, fired in a kiln and finally added piece by piece to a Lifetiles mural. Hundreds of these tiles work in harmony to create a huge moving image when displayed on a wall. Seder patented the painstaking technique but thinks most other artists wouldn't have his patience, even if they had his know-how. ""It's not that I've been playing my cards close to my vest,"" he said. ""It's just very difficult to do."" A Lifetiles installation, from conception to completion, can take up to a year to complete. It's a labor of love he shares with others who walk by his ""magic"" walls. ""I love to watch people react to the work. They don't expect a wall to move,"" he said. ""They'll be walking down the hallway in a museum and walking outdoors through a zoo ... and suddenly they realize, 'Those dolphins are starting to move next to me! How is that possible?' ""","Lifetiles are murals, created without electricity or moving parts, that appear to move .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The former Halliburton subsidiary KBR has been charged with bribing Nigerian government officials with ""tens of millions of dollars"" to obtain ""billions of dollars in contracts,"" according to court documents filed late Friday in Houston, Texas. KBR was spun off from its former parent corporation Halliburton in 2007. Justice Department lawyers filed an ""information,"" which is generally associated with an expected plea agreement. The Justice Department had no comment on the filing, but officials familiar with the case said they expected KBR representatives to appear Wednesday in federal court in Houston. The 22-page court document outlines a complex joint venture involving KBR and the Nigeria government-owned National Petroleum Corporation charged with developing the country's oil and gas industry. The contracts involved the design and construction of a natural gas plant. The government documents say the joint venture included payments to international consultants to bribe Nigerian officials. The alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act come after the conviction of Albert Stanley, KBR's former chief executive officer, who pleaded guilty to bribery last fall. ""We are not providing comment at this time,"" said company spokeswoman Heather Browne in an e-mail. She referred CNN to a filing in October that cited a consortium that included KBR called TSKJ. It said, ""information has been uncovered suggesting that, commencing at least 10 years ago, members of TSKJ planned payments to Nigerian officials. We have reason to believe, based on the ongoing investigations, that payments may have been made by agents of TSKJ to Nigerian officials. ""The government has recently confirmed that it has evidence of such payments. The government has also recently advised Halliburton and KBR that it has evidence of payments to Nigerian officials by another agent in connection with a separate KBR-managed offshore project in Nigeria and possibly evidence of payments in connection with other projects in Nigeria."" The company said that in June 2004 it terminated its relationship with Stanley, and noted his guilty plea. ""By the plea, Mr. Stanley admitted that he participated in a scheme to bribe Nigerian government officials and that payments were made by agents of TSKJ to Nigerian officials in connection with the construction and expansion by TSKJ of the complex at Bonny Island,"" it said. KBR, which was spun off from its former parent corporation Halliburton in 2007, has been under fire for its business practices in providing logistical support to the U.S. war effort in Iraq. The Nigerian charges are separate from KBR's contracts in Iraq and Kuwait.

At the end of the wake, Brown will be flown from Mansfield, Ohio, to Andrews Air Force Base. After he casts his vote, he will return to Ohio for his mother's funeral early Saturday. The plane is being provided by the White House, Brown's office said, because the vote is considered ""official business,"" and there are no commercial flights available that would allow him to cast the vote and return to Ohio for his mother's funeral Saturday morning. A White House official refused to provide a cost estimate for the military plane, but acknowledged ""it will be a higher cost than if he were flying commercial.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A motorcycle gang carried out a bold smash-and-grab raid on a jewelry store in the center of London -- right in front of a CNN camera. One of the raiders can be seen clutching stolen watches as the gang makes its getaway. CNN reporter Sasha Herriman and cameraman Peter Kavanagh were filming in Oxford Street, London's busiest retail area, when the raiders took a sledgehammer to the store's windows in broad daylight. Kavanagh kept the camera rolling as the thieves helped themselves to handfuls of luxury watches before roaring off on their motorcycles, leaving a crowd of stunned shoppers in their wake. ""They always tell you to expect the unexpected when working in news, and this certainly was unexpected,"" said Kavanagh, an Australian cameraman with 19 years' experience.

"(CNN) -- Boeing is asking pilots who fly its 737 jets to pay careful attention to flight instruments after Dutch investigators said a faulty altimeter contributed to the recent crash of a 737 in the Netherlands. Turkish Airlines Flight 1951 broke into three pieces near Schiphol Airport on February 25. The 737 is the most widely flown jet in commercial aviation. More than 6,000 have been sold, according to Boeing. ""Boeing reminds all operators to make sure flight crews pay close attention to all primary flight controls during critical stages of a flight,"" Boeing spokesman Jim Proulx told CNN on Thursday. On February 25, Turkish Airlines Flight 1951 from Istanbul to Amsterdam dropped from the sky on approach to the landing strip at Schiphol Airport, breaking into three pieces in a muddy field. Nine people died and 80 people were hurt in the accident. In a memo to pilots, Boeing says there was a malfunction in one of the plane's two altimeters, which measure the altitude above the terrain where the plane is going to land. The left altimeter was giving ""erroneous"" information, indicating that the plane was below 7 or 8 feet from ground level when it was actually about 2,000 feet in the air, the memo said. That caused the automatic throttles to slow the plane down. ""Boeing recommends operators inform flight crews of the above investigation details and the (Dutch Safety Board) interim report when it is released. In addition, crews should be reminded to carefully monitor primary flight instruments,"" the memo said. The plane was on automatic pilot when it crashed, said Pieter van Vollenhoven, head of the Dutch Safety Board. The weather was misty at the time of the crash, possibly keeping the pilots from noticing their altitude, Van Vollenhoven said. Automatic pilot should not be used for landings if altimeters are malfunctioning, he said. Dutch investigators said there had been faulty meter readings on two other flights of the same jet, but the pilots were able to land. In the Amsterdam crash, the pilots did not recognize the altimeter problem until it was too late, Van Vollenhoven said. The Boeing memo notes that ""the autothrottle, which uses the left radio altimeter data, transitioned to landing flare mode and retarded the throttles to the idle stop. The throttles remained at the idle stop for approximately 100 seconds during which time the airspeed decreased to approximately 40 knots below the selected approach speed."" Proulx said he did not know what that speed was for that particular 737 model. The warning issued by Boeing was for many other models of 737 jets, not just the 737-800 involved in the Amsterdam crash.","Boeing urges 737 pilots to pay careful attention to flight instruments .

"(CNN) -- Scientists in Colombia have unearthed the remains of a true prehistoric monster believed to be the biggest snake ever to have lived on Earth. An artist's impression of what Titanoboa cerrejonensis would have looked like. Named Titanoboa cerrejonensis, the snake would have weighed 1,140 kilograms (2,500 pounds) and measured 13 meters (42.7 feet) nose to tail tip -- dwarfing the largest modern pythons and anacondas which can grow to 6 meters (19.5 feet). Scientists believe it slithered around the planet between 58 and 60 million years ago. Geologist David Polly, who identified the position of the fossil vertebrae which made a size estimate possible, said in a statement Wednesday: ""At its greatest width, the snake would have come up to about your hips. The size is pretty amazing. ""But our team went a step further and asked, how warm would the Earth have to be to support a body of this size?"" Titanoboa's fossilized remains were discovered at a coal mine in the tropical Cerrejon region of northern Colombia by an international team of scientists. ""Truly enormous snakes really spark people's imagination, but reality has exceeded the fantasies of Hollywood,"" paleontologist Jonathan Bloch, who co-led the expedition, told reporters. ""The snake that tried to eat Jennifer Lopez in the movie 'Anaconda' was not as big as the one we found."" Based on the snake's size, the team was able to calculate that the mean annual temperature in equatorial South America 60 million years ago would have been about 91 degrees Fahrenheit, about 10 degrees warmer than today, Bloch said. ""Tropical ecosystems of South America were surprisingly different 60 million years ago,"" said Bloch. ""It was a rainforest, like today, but it was even hotter and the cold-blooded reptiles were all substantially larger. ""The result was, among other things, the largest snakes the world has ever seen...and hopefully ever will."" According to Nature.com, snakes are poikilotherms (cold-blooded) that, unlike humans, need heat from their environment to power their metabolism. Therefore research suggests that at the time the region would have had to be no less than 86 to 93 degrees Fahrenheit for the snake to have survived. Most large snakes today live in the tropical regions of South America and south-east Asia, where the high temperatures allow them to grow to impressive sizes. Meanwhile, Carlos Jaramillo -- who was also part of the expedition -- said the tropical rainforest at Cerrejon appeared to have thrived at these temperatures. ""This data challenges the view that tropical vegetation lives near its climatic optimum, and it has profound implications in understanding the effect of current global warming on tropical plants,"" he said.","Snake weighed 1,140 kgs (2,500 pounds), measured 13 meters (42.7 feet)

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican authorities arrested Vicente Carrillo Leyva, a leader of the Carrillo Fuentes drug cartel, officials announced Thursday. Vicente Carrillo Leyva is escorted by police at a news conference in Mexico City on Thursday. Carrillo Leyva was arrested as he exercised in a park in a residential area of Mexico City, where he had been living under the alias Alejandro Peralta Alvarez, officials said. The federal attorney general's office told reporters he was tracked through his wife, who did not change her name. Carrillo Leyva ""is considered one of the heirs to the criminal organization known as the Juarez Cartel, after the death of his father, Amado Carrillo Fuentes,"" said Assistant Prosecutor Maricela Morales. His father died in July 1997 while undergoing plastic surgery to alter his appearance in an effort to avoid capture. Amado Carrillo was known as ""El Senor de los Cielos,"" the ""Lord of the Skies,"" because of the fleet of jetliners he used to transport cocaine from Colombia to Mexico. Carrillo Leyva, 32, was presented at the news conference, surrounded by black-clad, hooded law-enforcement officials. He wore dark-frame glasses and a white jogging suit with double black stripes on the sleeves. His dark hair was long and shaggy. Last month, federal officials offered a reward of up to $2.16 million (30 million pesos) for information leading to his arrest. The same reward has been offered for his uncle, cartel leader Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, also known as ""El Viceroy"" and ""El General,"" who remains at-large. Rewards of $2 million apiece have been offered for 22 other leading cartel suspects. Wednesday's arrest was the fourth detention of a top drug cartel leader in recent weeks. Last week, officials announced the arrest of Hector Huerta Rios, also known as ""La Burra"" or ""El Junior,"" a top lieutenant of the Beltran Leyva cartel. He was arrested in the city of San Pedro Garza Garcia in Nuevo Leon state, along Mexico's border with the United States. The previous week, Mexican authorities announced the arrest of Sigifredo Najera Talamantes, a drug-trafficking suspect accused of attacking a U.S. consulate and killing Mexican soldiers. Talamantes, also known as ""El Canicon,"" also is suspected in attacks on a television station in Monterrey in Nuevo Leon, the state-run Notimex agency said. That same week, the Mexican military also arrested the son of a top drug cartel lieutenant. Authorities on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border blame drug cartels for a surge in violence in the region. Despite the violence, Mexican officials say the country is generally safe and that tourist areas such as Cancun and Acapulco are heavily patrolled. Watch Leyva get escorted by law enforcement officials » . Officials from Acapulco city hall, the Guerrero state government and the Mexico attorney general went so far as to sign a statement in early March assuring students wanting to go there on spring break that efforts had been taken to ensure their safety. In a speech in mid-March, Mexican President Felipe Calderon said 93 percent of the 6,500 deaths attributed to organized crime in 2008 occurred among the criminals. Most of the rest were law enforcement authorities, officials have said. Few civilians are killed, the president said. In that same speech, Calderon ridiculed those who say Mexico is unsafe. ""It is absolutely false, absurd, that anyone indicate that Mexico does not have control over one single part of its national territory,"" he said. ""I challenge anyone who says that to tell me what part of the country they want to go to and I will take that person there."" Analysts point out that most of the violence is occurring along the U.S. border, particularly in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua and Tijuana. Drug cartel violence is also found on Mexico's western coast. ""The situation in Ciudad Juarez is of special concern,"" the U.S. State Department said in a February 20 travel alert.

"(CNN) -- The great paddlewheel turned the Ohio River water to a froth as the Delta Queen steamboat, a floating National Historic Landmark, departed Cincinnati, Ohio, on its final scheduled voyage this week. The Delta Queen is the last running steam-driven, paddlewheeled overnight passenger boat. The boat is a throwback to the 1800s and the era of Mark Twain, when thousands of steam-driven paddlewheelers plied the Mississippi River system. The Delta Queen is the last of those operating as overnight passenger boats on U.S. waterways, giving riders a 19th-century experience on cruises complete with the carnival-like sounds of the steam-whistle calliope. But it will dock permanently if Congress doesn't grant a safety exemption. It left Cincinnati on Tuesday on a 10-day cruise down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to Memphis, Tennessee, where it will unload what could be its final passengers. ""There are so few really authentic things left. Everything is a re-creation or a tied up old dusty museum,"" said Vicki Webster, leader of the grassroots Save the Delta Queen Campaign. ""The Delta Queen is a breathing part of history and we have to keep as many of those as we can."" The frequent riders and steamboat aficionados are being punished, Webster insists. Sherrin Kraus, 66, admires the Delta Queen as it passes by her home in Hanover, Indiana, each year. ""I've been in love with this boat since I was 5 years old,"" Kraus told CNN affiliate WLWT-TV when the ship arrived in Cincinnati. iReport.com: Share your photos, videos and memories of the Delta Queen . Kraus and her husband Ken boarded the Delta Queen's possible final voyage to celebrate their 45th anniversary. They told WLWT they decided to celebrate the occasion early out of concern the ship would not get another exemption. ""This was our 45th anniversary trip because we don't know what the future's going to bring, but we're worried,"" Kraus said. ""If she doesn't survive this last onslaught, it's the end of an era."" The Delta Queen will go out of service if Congress does not grant the ship another exemption from a 1960s federal law, the Safety at Seas Act, which bans boats made largely out of wood because of fire hazards. The current exemption, which expires at the end of October, has been given to the ship nine times over 40 years.  See the Delta Queen's life in photos » . Supporters of the boat, which has roamed the nation's waterways since 1927 and helped the Navy ferry survivors of the attack on Pearl Harbor to San Francisco hospitals in 1941, are hopeful the ship will not play its famed calliope for the last time.  iReport.com: Watch the ship depart as a calliope concert plays . The grassroots campaign is gaining traction and the support of high ranking politicians. House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement he would work with Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, to try to get an exemption granted if the House returns for a lame duck session to address economic issues following the election. Supporters, including several mayors, agree with Webster that granting an exemption to the Delta Queen would be a way to help stimulate the economy without it costing taxpayers a dime. Lee Powell, director of the Mississippi Delta Grassroots Caucus said the boat provides economic opportunities. By docking and unloading nearly 200 passengers up to a dozen times a year,  the Delta Queen helps to pump money into small cities along the heartland's rivers that are not normally tourist destinations. Helena, Arkansas, which Mark Twain wrote in Life on the Mississippi ""occupies one of the prettiest situations on the river,"" could suffer if the boat ceases operation. ""There are places in Helena that are essentially at virtually the levels of a third world country,"" Powell said. ""They were impoverished before and now with the economic suffering, to choke off one of the good things they have is ridiculous."" The fight ahead is not uncharted territory for the Delta Queen, which fought down to the wire in 1970 to be given the exemption. Rep. James Oberstar, a Minnesota Democrat who heads up the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has refused to support the exemption, claiming the boat, with a steel hull but largely wooden superstructure, is a fire hazard. Webster, who says she is ""seething with anger"" about the complaint, said the ship is outfitted with state-of-the-art fire safety equipment and a full fire crew on board. ""The heat detectors are so sensitive in the rooms if you take a shower and forget to close your bathroom door, the heat detectors go off,"" Webster said. ""It's ridiculous. You literally could not have a fire on the boat because it would be put out in seconds."" Webster says the fight with Oberstar amounts to a labor dispute and that Oberstar is bowing to the Seafarers International Union which represented the boat's employees before it was bought by Majestic America Line. Oberstar and the union have both denied those accusations, but Webster insists simple politics are getting in the way of saving a national treasure. ""They're holding her hostage,"" Webster said. ""That's like punishing a child because his parents are bickering or tearing down the Statute of Liberty because of a dispute between the owners of the land and the snack shop.""","Delta Queen paddlewheeler has been in service since 1927 .

"(CNN)  -- Liverpool want to avoid playing on the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster and UEFA president Michel Platini says he will ""do his utmost"" to make it a reality. Liverpool fans had to be treated on the pitch as the tragedy unfolded at Hillsborough in 1989. The anniversary falls on April 15, one of two dates set aside for the second leg of this season's Champions League quarterfinal ties, the other being the previous day. European governing body UEFA issued a statement from Platini, rejecting reports that they had snubbed the appeal by Liverpool. ""We are aware of the huge significance of the April 15 date for both Liverpool FC and their fans, and that is why we will do our utmost to make sure that the club does not have to play its UEFA Champions League second leg quarterfinal match on that day,"" Platini said. ""This being the 20th anniversary of that tragic disaster in 1989 makes it even more relevant and we will take this into account."" Ninety six people died when Liverpool supporters were crushed at the Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough on April 15, 1989, before the start of their team's FA Cup semifinal against Nottingham Forest. A cousin of Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was among the dead, and the England midfielder has urged UEFA to be sympathetic to the club. Gerrard told Press Association at the weekend: ""We're still waiting to see whether UEFA will make us play on the day. That would be far from ideal given all the emotion that always surrounds the club on that day."" Liverpool have never played a game on the anniversary of the tragedy. The Champions League quarterfinal draw takes place on Friday with four English clubs in the draw and no seedings in place. Liverpool reached the quarterfinals with a superb 4-0 home win over Real Madrid last week and followed it up with a 4-1 thumping of Manchester United to revive their Premier League title hopes.","Liverpool anxious to avoid playing on 20th anniversary of Hillsborough tragedy .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A new sleeper virus that could allow hackers to steal financial and personal information has now spread to more than eight million computers in what industry analysts say is one of the most serious infections they have ever seen. Experts say a single infected laptop could expose an entire network to the worm. The Downadup or Conficker worm exploits a bug in Microsoft Windows to infect mainly corporate networks, where -- although it has yet to cause any harm -- it potentially exposes infected PCs to hijack. Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at anti-virus firm F-Secure, says while the purpose of the worm is unclear, its unique ""phone home"" design, linking back to its point of origin, means it can receive further orders to wreak havoc. He said his company had reverse-engineered its program, which they suspected of originating in Ukraine, and is using the call-back mechanism to monitor an exponential infection rate, despite Microsoft's issuing of a patch to fix the bug. ""On Tuesday there were 2.5 million, on Wednesday 3.5 million and today [Friday], eight million,"" he told CNN. ""It's getting worse, not better."" Hypponen explained to CNN the dangers that Downadup poses, who is most at risk and what can be done to stop its spread. How serious is it? It is the most serious large scale worm outbreak we have seen in recent years because of how widespread it is, but it is not very serious in terms of what it does. So far it doesn't try to steal personal information or credit card details. Who is affected? We have large infections in Europe, the United States and in Asia. It is a Windows worm and almost all the cases are corporate networks. There are very few reports of independent home computers affected. What does it do? It is a complicated worm most likely engineered by a group of people who have spent time making it very complicated to analyze and remove. The real reason why they have created it is hard to say right now, but we do know how it replicates. How does it spread? The worm does not spread over email or the Web. However if an infected laptop is connected to your corporate network, it will immediately scan the network looking for machines to infect. These will be machines that have not installed a patch from Microsoft known as MS08-067. The worm will also scan company networks trying to guess your password, trying hundreds and hundreds of common words. If it gets in, even if you are not at your machine, it will infect and begin spreading to other servers. A third method of spreading is via USB data sticks. How can I prevent it infecting my machine? The best way is to get the patch and install it company-wide. The second way is password security. Use long, difficult passwords -- particularly for administrators who cannot afford to be locked out of the machines they will have to fix. What can I do if it has already infected? Machines can be disinfected. The problem is for companies with thousands of infected machines, which can become re-infected from just one computer even as they are being cleared.","A new sleeper virus has now spread to more than eight million computers .

"(CNN) -- Kaka underlined his commitment to AC Milan with two goals in a 4-1 Serie A win at Bologna on Sunday when on-loan David Beckham claimed his first goal in Italian football. Kaka scored twice for AC Milan days after rejecting a world record transfer to Manchester City. Brazilian star Kaka, playing his first match since the collapse of a  proposed world record transfer to Premier League Manchester City, converted from the penalty spot after 17 minutes and added a spectacular second two minutes before half-time. Kaka's double took the limelight away from former England captain Beckham who made his mark on the hour as Milan kept up the pressure on top two, city rivals Inter and Turin-based Juventus. Beckham moved to Milan from Los Angeles Galaxy earlier this month and found the target as coach Carlo Ancelotti marked 400 games in charge of the club. The former Mancherster United star is clearly enjoying his stay in Italy and there have been suggestions he could extend his stay. ""I can't say what will happen,"" PA Sport quoted him as saying on Sunday. ""Even if my contract says that I'll be here until March. We'll have to see. ""At the moment I'm enjoying this experience. I'm at one of the biggest clubs in the world. And having won gives us confidence to continue."" He added: ""It's great to score my first goal -- I will keep this jersey. It's special to play for Milan and also to score, but what's most important is that we won."" Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti was delighted with Beckham's performance, but insists the club can do nothing to keep him at the San Siro. However, he claims the 33-year-old holds his future in his own hands. ""If he said 'we'll see' it means he's thinking about staying,"" Ancelotti told Sky Italia. ""However, our hands are tied as he has a clear contract."" Bologna took the lead through a Marco Di Vaio penalty after nine minutes and Clarence Seedorf equalised after Kaka's effort had been spilled by goalkeeper Francesco Antonioli. AS Roma closed to within three points of fourth, the final Champions League qualifying position, with a stunning 3-0 win at Napoli. Centre-backs Philippe Mexes (18) and Juan (32) gave Roma a two-goal lead at the interval and Montenegro forward Mirko Vucinic added the third four minutes into the second half. Roma are now only three points behind Genoa who were surprisingly held to a 1-1 home draw by Catania who led through a 67th-minute goal from Jorge Martinez. Diego Milito replied six minutes later. Roma have won eight of their last 10 Serie A matches following an awful start to the season where they won only two and lost six of their first 10 games. Fabio Simplicio scored twice as Palermo defeated Udinese 3-2 while strugglers Lecce and Torino shared six goals.","Brazil star Kaka scores twice as AC Milan romp to 4-1 Serie A win at Bologna .

"DENDERMONDE, Belgium (CNN) -- Authorities have charged a 20-year-old man with murder and attempted murder in a stabbing rampage at a Belgian nursery school that left two children and a staff member dead and a dozen others wounded. A family pays tribute Friday evening outside the nursery school in Dendermonde, Belgium. The regional prosecutor's office identified the man, who has been in custody since Friday, as Kim D., and would not release his last name. They said he lives alone in Sinaai, a city about 20 kilometers (12 miles) outside of Dendermonde. He has no police record and is unemployed, the office said. Authorities allege the man, whose face was painted white with black rings around his eyes, entered the Fabeltjesland (Fable Land) nursery school midmorning Friday and began stabbing those inside. He entered the building through a side door, typically only used by parents who are late in arriving to pick up their children from the school, authorities said. Once inside, he went through several rooms in the center. The dead included the head of the nursery, a woman in her 60s who was well known in the town, residents said. The other victims were young; the nursery cared for children up to the age of three.  Watch report on attack » . Authorities caught up with him about an hour-and-a-half later after the attack ended, the ministry said. At the time of his arrest, he had on him a knife, an ax and a fake pistol. He was wearing a bullet-proof vest, authorities said. Two other knives were found at the nursery school, but it has not been confirmed whether they were used in the attack. Kim D. has said nothing to authorities regarding the attack, the prosecutor's office said. Authorities have searched his home, but they did not release any information from the search. Watch description of what happened » . The suspect, who is being held in jail, is scheduled to appear in court Tuesday morning. The judge has assigned three doctors to monitor him, authorities said.

"(CNN)  -- At least 23 people died Saturday when a protest rally turned violent outside Madagascar's Presidential Palace, a fire official at the main hospital said. People duck to avoid gunfire Saturday in Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar. The official said 83 people were injured during the demonstration in the capital city of Antananarivo, according to journalist Dregoire Pourtier, who passed the information to CNN. The International Committee of the Red Cross helped at least 18 injured people, press officer Mbola Ramamanana said. Brittany Martin, an American who is a Harvard Fellow and lives near the palace, said she could hear the crowd cheering amid intermittent gunshots and noises that may have been tear gas canisters. iReport.com: Are you there? ""From the window I can see military cars and ambulances driving by,"" Martin said. ""Nothing is up in smoke. We know there have been people killed from French and Malagasy news reports. ""We can see the back of the president's palace. This morning was totally peaceful. We knew that Andry [Rajoelina] was unveiling his new government at the May 13th Plaza, which was peaceful,"" she said, citing a friend who was there. Madagascar's government is in flux. President Marc Ravalomanana fired Rajoelina as mayor of Antananarivo and put someone else in the job, but Rajoelina is still technically mayor and claims to head a transitional national government. Martin said she heard gunshots starting about 2 p.m., after the protesters marched from the plaza to the palace. She said it was unclear where the shots were coming from. Some media reports blamed foreign mercenaries for the shootings; others said army guards were responsible or that the army was firing at the mercenaries to protect the crowd. Violence in Madagascar began January 26, when protesters stormed state-run television and radio stations in Antananarivo. Hours earlier, the government had shut down a radio station owned by Rajoelina and, weeks before, had similarly shut down Rajoelina's television station after it aired an interview with ex-President Didier Ratsiraka. Ravalomanana took power in 2001 after ousting Ratsiraka in a tense, hotly contested election. Ratsiraka fled to France afterward. Loyalists blame Ratsiraka's family members for inciting the recent trouble. There is also anger in Madagascar -- where the World Bank says the average person earns about $320 a year -- over reports that Ravalomanana recently bought a $60 million airplane. Last Saturday, Rajoelina took to the streets, declaring himself the nation's leader after a week of violence and looting that killed at least 80 people and wounded more than 300. Rajoelina urged supporters to demand the resignation of Ravalomanana and said he planned to take charge until a transition government can be established in the island nation off Africa's southeastern coast.  Map » . ""What we've been pushing for is dialogue the whole time,"" said Rodney Ford, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy. He said he received reports that palace guards used tear gas and shot into the air to try to disperse the crowd. ""I don't think anyone wanted violence."" According to the U.S. State Department, Madagascar has about 20 million people with ethnic origins in Africa and Asia. It was administered by the British Empire during much of the 19th century until it came under the control of France, from which it gained independence in 1960.","Gunfire heard near presidential palace, site of anti-government rally .

"(CNN) -- Bulgaria is a Turkish toilet, France is always on strike, Romania is a vampire theme-park and the UK... Well the UK doesn't exist. The piece ""Entropa"" shows Romania as a giant Dracula-inspired theme park. That's the view of the European Union according to a controversial art installation by Czech artist David Cerny, commissioned by his government to mark its six-month presidency of the pan-continental body. The work, ""Entropa,"" frames various representations of each member state as components of a giant multimedia model kit. But the piece, scheduled to have its official unveiling Thursday at the EU headquarters in Brussels, has sparked controversy.  Look at images of European nations » . Bulgaria's foreign ministry has summoned the Czech ambassador in Sofia to lodge a protest about the piece, according to the Czech News Agency. What do you think about images? And Betina Joteva, spokesperson of the Bulgarian permanent representation to the EU, said in comments reported by EUObserver.com: ""It [the work] is preposterous, a disgrace. It is a humiliation for the Bulgarian nation and an offence to [our] national dignity."" Bulgaria is not the only nation to suffer an unflattering depiction. Germany is criss-crossed by a series of autobahns in what some critics say is a close approximation of a swastika; Spain is a giant construction site in a dig at its building boom; and Luxembourg is a gold covered nugget sporting a ""For Sale"" sign. The Netherlands is depicted as a submerged land with only minarets peeking through the waves in an apparent reference to its religious tensions. Poland recreates the WWII flag-raising at Iwo Jima, only with the U.S. Marines and the Stars and Stripes replaced with Catholic clergy brandishing the multi-colored gay pride flag. The UK is absent from the work -- possibly because of its on-off relationship with the rest of the continent. The Czech government said in a statement on its presidency Web site Tuesday that the original brief was for the work to be created by 27 artists representing all EU Member States -- and that it was ""unpleasantly surprised"" to learn that this was not the case. ""David Cerny bears full responsibility for not fulfilling his assignment and promise,"" said Alexandr Vondra, Deputy Prime Minister. ""In this situation we are now considering further steps. The government said it will issue a further statement Thursday. The comments were in contrast to a statement issued by Vondra Monday, when he said that ""sculpture, and art more generally, can speak where words fail. I am confident in Europe's open mind and capacity to appreciate such a project."" Cerny is no stranger to controversy. In 1991 he was arrested after painting pink a Soviet tank that served as a Prague war memorial. His Web site shows other examples of his work, including previous kit-style installations entitled ""Jesus Christ"" and ""Dead Raped Woman""; and a life-size bronze fountain that depicts two men standing opposite each other, urinating. Cerny, and his main collaborators Kristof Kintera and Tomas Pospiszyl apologized to Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek and other government ministers Tuesday, according to a statement on the artist's Web site, for "" not having informed them about what is true and for having misled them. The statement adds that Cerny and his colleagues initially wanted to use 27 European artists for ""Entropa"", but fell short due to lack of time and money. Instead, they say, they decided to create fictional artists, some of whom have even been given their own Web sites. Cerny says he knew the truth would eventually come out but adds: ""We believe that the environment of Brussels is capable of ironic self-reflection, we believe in the sense of humor of European nations and their representatives.""

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- China surpassed the United States in 2008 as the world's top user of the Internet, according to a government-backed research group. Nearly 91 percent of China's Internet users are surfing the Web with a broadband connection. The number of Web surfers in the country grew by nearly 42 percent to 298 million, according to the China Internet Network Information Center's January report. And there's plenty of room for growth, as only about 1 in every 4 Chinese has Internet access. The rapid growth in China's Internet use can be tied to its swift economic gains and the government's push for the construction of telephone and broadband lines in the country's vast rural areas, the report says. The Chinese government wants phone and broadband access in each village by 2010. Nearly 91 percent of China's Internet users are surfing the Web with a broadband connection -- an increase of 100 million from 2007.

Earlier this month, China released a blacklist of 19 major online portals and Web sites, including Google and Baidu, that it claims provide and spread pornographic or obscene content. The move came as several Chinese government agencies, including the Ministry of Public Security, launched a month-long campaign to clean up the Web, according to the state-run Xinhua news service. China has come under criticism for restricting Web access to ordinary citizens as well as on local and foreign media covering last year's summer Olympics in Beijing.

"LITTLE ROCK, Arkansas (CNN) -- Carlotta Walls LaNier points out the only two African-Americans in her senior class as she flips through her high school yearbook. She pauses when she sees the picture on a page dedicated to ""Integration."" Carlotta Walls LaNier and eight other members of the Little Rock Nine are invited to Obama's inauguration. It's been nearly five decades since LaNier graduated from Little Rock Central High School in Arkansas. ""It shows how the 101st were on the grounds of the school,"" says LaNier. In 1957, soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division, an elite Army unit, escorted LaNier and eight other African-American students into the all-white public high school. The students, who became known as the Little Rock Nine, were taunted and threatened by an angry mob. ""We knew we could not participate in extracurricular activities,"" recalls LaNier. ""There was one who could have been in the band, one who could have been on track. I was the one who played basketball ... I couldn't do that."" Back then, LaNier thought once the doors of equality were open it wouldn't be long before an African-American became president. ""I had hoped to see something like that in the next 10 or 15 years when I was in high school but that didn't happen,"" says LaNier. What has happened is a new generation of students walks the halls at Central High. Even though the exterior looks the same as it did during integration -- the interior would be almost unrecognizable to LaNier and the other Little Rock Nine.  Student: I can't believe it happened here, but I'm glad it did » . Today, the sea of mostly white faces has disappeared. The hallways are now filled with a more racially diverse student body. Students take a class to learn about the school's history and many say it's given them a greater appreciation for racial tolerance. ""Now it's definitely hard to imagine -- you walk into the halls and you see people of all different races are in the hallway. And in addition, the majority of our school is African-American now,"" points out Afshar Sanati, student body president. ""It is hard for me to walk inside the school every day and see how this place could have been such a hostile environment for nine African-American students."" LaNier is still humble when she reflects on her experience. ""We all knew that we were giving up something for a bigger cause and [we were] happy that we did it,"" says LaNier. ""Because it has been 51 years, I think they were baby steps now. But they were big steps then."" The steps taken by the Little Rock Nine were so big, in fact, they received personal invitations to attend President-elect Barack Obama's inauguration. ""I think the Little Rock Nine set the foundation,"" says student Sarah Karney. ""I don't think [Obama's election] could have happened without them."" Today, many students at Central High see themselves as the beneficiaries of an Obama presidency. ""Him being president means there actually is a chance for anyone to do what they want to do if they work hard enough,"" says Helena Liu, who says she doesn't see race when she looks at Obama. ""It doesn't depend on your race -- it depends on who you are, the quality of your character,"" says DeIvory Howard. ""[We've] got to get past just the color of our skins being newsworthy. It's really about all the things we knew we could do for this country and now we have the opportunity to show it and it's going to come through his leadership,"" says LaNier. ""And, we're looking forward to that."" Senior Chris Bell couldn't agree more. ""This election proves that this America is just not the old America.

"(CNN) -- North Korea has begun reprocessing fuel rods, its Foreign Ministry said Saturday, according to state-run media. A satellite view of the nuclear facility at Yongbyon. ""The reprocessing of spent fuel rods from the pilot atomic power plant began as declared in the Foreign Ministry statement dated April 14,"" a ministry spokesman said. ""This will contribute to bolstering the nuclear deterrence for self-defense in every way to cope with the increasing military threats from the hostile forces."" North Korea, angered by the United Nations Security Council's unanimous condemnation of a rocket launch, has threatened to walk away from the six-party talks aimed at disarming the country of nuclear weapons. It has said it will restore its disabled nuclear reactor. The six-party talks -- involving China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea and the United States -- have been aimed at persuading North Korea to scrap its nuclear program. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, during an unannounced visit to Baghdad, Iraq, said the United States and its partners are working to resume the discussions. A U.N. panel Friday targeted three North Korean companies to have their assets frozen in response to Pyongyang's April 5 rocket launch. The companies that made the list were Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation (KOMID), Korea Ryonbong General Corporation and Tanchon Commercial Bank. U.N. member nations that have dealings with those companies must now freeze their assets. A presidential statement from the Security Council on April 13 authorized the sanctions panel to update a 2006 resolution barring North Korea from launching ballistic missiles after Pyongyang launched what it said was a communications satellite after weeks of warnings from the West not to do so. North Korea declared the launch successful, but U.S. officials said the missile's payload fell into the Pacific Ocean shortly after the launch. Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom had sought a new resolution imposing new sanctions on North Korea, but China and Russia -- permanent members of the Security Council with veto privileges -- blocked the way.","NEW: U.S., partners working to resume talks, Clinton says .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- An American professor doing research in London stumbled across a series of previously unknown letters written by, to, and about Benjamin Franklin, a stunning find that sheds new light on early U.S. history. The letters cover Benjamin Franklin's success in dealing with a British general. The collection of 47 letters are hand-written copies made 250 years ago, when Franklin lived in London. That they were filed under the copyist's name, not Franklin's, may explain why they were overlooked by historians until now, said a curator at the British Library, where the letters are held. The find is reported in the April issue of the William & Mary Quarterly, a journal of early American history and culture. The letters are important in large part because they offer a ""wealth of new details"" that affect modern understanding of Franklin, writes Alan Houston, the political science professor who discovered the letters in the spring of 2007. They also raise the question of how many other documents remain waiting to be found on Franklin and his life. Houston, a professor at the University of California at San Diego, discovered the letters on the last day of his last research trip to London, just before the library's closing time. ""The first item was a letter from Benjamin Franklin to the secretary of the governor of Maryland, and I looked at it and I started to read, and I thought, 'This doesn't look familiar,'"" Houston told CNN. ""I've read everything Franklin ever wrote."" Houston said he quickly began to realize he had uncovered something previously unknown to historians. ""I swear, I just about shot through the ceiling I was so excited,"" he said. ""It's like finding a treasure chest."" Houston had been working at the time on a book on Franklin, ""Benjamin Franklin and the Politics of Improvement,"" published last year. The letters cover Franklin's success in dealing with British Gen. Edward Braddock, who had been sent to Pennsylvania in 1755 to defeat the French at Fort Duquesne, in modern-day Pittsburgh. The march to retake the fort was part of the French and British battle for control of the western lands in the colonies, part of a larger struggle for control of North America, Houston said. The problem was that Braddock was given no horses or wagons when he arrived in America -- no means of transport for him and his 2,000 redcoats. Braddock started to blame his hosts, so Franklin -- the Pennsylvania assembly's leading politician -- stepped in to help. Franklin went all over Pennsylvania trying to persuade farmers to lend their horses and wagons to Braddock and his men. It wasn't easy, because the farmers were tough negotiators who were also anxious and suspicious of the effort. Eventually, Franklin managed to get the farmers to agree, and within weeks, Braddock and his men were on the march. Braddock suffered a devastating defeat before he even reached the fort, however, when a much smaller contingent of French and Indian soldiers surprised the British. They killed Braddock and about 1,000 of his men. Despite the defeat, Franklin's success -- in what became known as ""the wagon affair"" -- highlighted his skill as a colonial leader, Houston said. When Franklin was sent to London in 1757 as a representative of the assembly, he brought with him a collection of letters detailing that success. It was proof of his political value to Great Britain and that the assembly's loyalties had been on the right side. This collection of letters, which Franklin referred to in his autobiography as his ""quire book,"" was never found, however -- until now. Houston said he believes the documents he read at the British Library are copies of that collection. They were made by Thomas Birch, an industrious and obsessive transcriber of historical documents who copied anything he could get his hands on. ""There was a vogue. It was very common for letters to be copied,"" said Matthew Shaw, curator of the U.S. collections at the British Library. ""Birch was very well known for being a copyist."" Birch and Franklin were friends in London, both members of the Royal Society, and Houston said he believes the copies were made sometime between 1757 and 1758. ""Birch undoubtedly found Franklin's quire book captivating, and he appears to have copied anything that remotely interested him,"" Houston writes in the journal. Also, Braddock's campaign and defeat were widely discussed in London, and ""Birch may have wanted to capture a crucial moment in the life of the (Royal) society's most famous American member."" Birch's transcripts were filed in the British Library as ""Copies of Letters relating to the March of General Braddock."" They form part of the massive Birch Collection containing the hundreds of volumes of his copies that Birch bequeathed to the library on his death, said Shaw. They weren't properly catalogued until the early 1970s, Shaw said, which is largely why they haven't been used by scholars. ""It's the first time they've really been shared with a wider audience,"" Shaw told CNN. ""We're very pleased.""","Collection of letters by, to, and about Benjamin Franklin found in London .

"(CNN) -- Human rights groups in Bangladesh and abroad are calling for an investigation after 16 borders guards accused of participating in a bloody revolt in February died in custody in recent days. A Bangladesh Rifles soldier is shown wearing a white cloth signifying surrender in late February. The Bangladesh military acknowledged the deaths of the Bangladesh Rifles paramilitary troops, or jawans -- but insisted they were the result of illness and suicide. ""Given the history of abuses by security forces in Bangladesh, there is no reason to take at face value the claim that these detainees have committed suicide,"" said Brad Adams, Asia director or the New York-based Human Rights Watch, in a statement. The 16 were among 1,100 jawans rounded up after a 35-hour mutiny that began on February 25 in the Rifles headquarters in the capital city, Dhaka. The jawans rebelled against their commanding officers, taking dozens of them hostage. When the standoff ended, more than 70 people were found dead -- the majority of them army officers. Initially, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina promised the jawans amnesty if they laid down their arms. But once the scope of the massacre came to light, Hasina withdrew her offer -- saying the government will not show mercy to those who killed, looted or committed arson. The jawans were issued an ultimatum to turn themselves in, while the government created a committee to probe into the mutiny. The result of the government inquiry is yet to be made public, after several delays. On Thursday, the Rifles leadership issued a statement that said 16 detainees have died in custody since March 9: four from suicide, six from heart attacks and six from other diseases. ""We believe that perhaps they have failed to cope with the mental pressure associated with the guilt of committing the brutal attacks,""the statement said. It then added: ""Suicide is seen as a sin in religious terms and is also socially undesirable."" In response, the legal aid group, Ain o Salish Kendro (Law and Adjudication Center), and the Bangladesh National Women Lawyers' Association were among several organizations calling for an investigation. During a hearing Wednesday, one of the suspects told a Dhaka court he had been administered electric shocks during a seven-day detention. Family members of other detainees have made similar allegations. Some of the suspects who died in custody had wounds on their bodies consisted with torture, Human Rights Watch said. Bangladeshi authorities have said the wounds may have been inflicted when the suspects tried to escape from the Rifles headquarters after the rebellion. ""The explanations given by representatives of the security forces are simply not credible,"" Adams said. ""Torture is a regular 'investigative technique' in Bangladesh and killing of detains in government custody is an endemic problem."" The country's elite anti-crime unit, Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), have often been accused of 'extra-judicial' killings. The battalion is involved in the interrogation of many of the Rifles suspects. Since its inception in 2004, more than 550 alleged criminals died soon after they were captured by RAB forces. In each case, the battalion claimed the arrested men died from stray bullets as their units were engaged in gun battles with the suspects' comrades. The 65,000-strong Bangladesh Rifles is responsible primarily for guarding the country's borders, but it also takes part in operations such as monitoring polls. It is distinct from the army, but their commanders are career army officers. The troops staged their rebellion on the second day of BDR Week, when officers and troops from various BDR outposts along the border were in the capital for celebrations. Discontent had been bubbling for years in the ranks of the BDR, who complained their army superiors dismissed their appeals for more pay, subsidized food and their requests to participate in United Nations peacekeeping operations -- which pay far more than what they make at home. Bangladesh and its South Asian neighbors are the largest troop contributors to U.N. peacekeeping operations. During the stand-off, dozens of officers were killed. Some bodies were dumped in mass graves. Others were tossed in sewers that emptied into a river, where they floated for miles before being retrieved.","Rights groups in Bangladesh, abroad call for probe into string of soldiers' deaths .

"(CNN) -- Greg Cannom. Remember that name. The late Heath Ledger is expected to win best supporting actor for playing the Joker in ""The Dark Knight."" It's not a household name, for sure. But this two-time Academy Award winner (for ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire"") is the red-hot favorite to win the Oscar in the best makeup category, for his work taking Brad Pitt from decrepitude to infancy in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."" His colleagues in the visual effects department are likely to join him, along with the art direction team and possibly costume designer Jacqueline West, taking ""Button's"" tally to four awards. But my hunch is that this will prove the outer limit of the Academy's love for David Fincher's epic. Not a good return on 13 nominations.  Watch which films, stars are up for top honors » . On the other hand, I predict that ""Slumdog Millionaire"" will reap the rewards, with as many as seven Oscars from 10 nominations, including best picture and best director for Danny Boyle. (A full sweep is impossible, as composer A.R. Rahman has been nominated against himself in the best song category. ""Slumdog"" will also probably miss out for sound editing and sound mixing, two categories that favor big-budget films.)  Watch how ""Slumdog"" is getting mixed reviews in India » . If I'm right, it will be a fairy-tale ending for what is in many respects a fairy tale of a movie, albeit a fairy tale punctuated with sometimes distressingly grim episodes of violence and poverty. Still, upsets do happen. Four years ago, all the pundits (including this one) had ""Brokeback Mountain"" pegged for best picture. Instead, a left-field movie that had been kicking around for months surged from behind and ""Crash""-ed the party. EW's Dave Karger makes his predictions . It could happen again, but this year ""Slumdog"" is -- or at least began as -- the left-field movie. The surprise came when American audiences embraced the energy and passion (the underdog spirit, if you will) of Boyle's film. After all, this was a film that Warner Bros. almost consigned straight to DVD until Fox Searchlight stepped up and obtained U.S. theatrical rights. North American box office receipts will probably reach the $100 million mark soon, making the $15 million film easily the most profitable of the best picture contenders. (""Benjamin Button"" has grossed more, but with a budget estimated at $150 million, it cost 10 times as much to make.)  Vote for your favorite nominees in major categories » . Best actor . The ""Slumdog"" wave won't affect the acting categories, not because the Academy struggles to recognize Indian excellence but because the lead roles in the film are split between three generations of young actors. Similar considerations will weigh against Brad Pitt's chances for best actor, despite his outstanding performance as ""Benjamin Button's"" lead. No one seems entirely clear where Pitt leaves off and the makeup, the CGI and the four other actors credited with playing the part take over. The pundits have decided that this category is a straight choice between Sean Penn (""Milk"") and Mickey Rourke (""The Wrestler""), and although I wouldn't rule out Frank Langella for his strangely sympathetic portrait of the disgraced president in ""Frost/Nixon,"" I have to agree that Penn and Rourke are both compelling choices, and either would be a worthy winner. Given the soft love the Academy has shown ""The Wrestler"" (two nominations) compared with ""Milk"" (eight, including best picture), Penn is the smart choice. But my heart goes with Rourke. Penn transforms himself to play Harvey Milk, but Rourke does something more difficult; he reveals himself.  Watch how Rourke made a comeback to get Oscar nomination » . Best actress . This category, like best actor, seems to come down to a choice between two: Meryl Streep (who overpowers the ethical uncertainties of ""Doubt"") and Kate Winslet (who contrives to make a mass murderer sexy and sympathetic in ""The Reader""). These are two ostentatious, technically demanding performances of the kind that Oscar voters appreciate; Melissa Leo's understated naturalism in the little-seen ""Frozen River"" would stand at the opposite end of the spectrum, well out of the limelight. It's astonishing that Streep -- by common consent our finest actress -- hasn't won an Academy Award since ""Sophie's Choice"" (1982), a losing streak that runs through 10 nominations (and counting). But at least she already has a couple of Oscars on her mantel, which is more than you can say for Kate Winslet, hoping it will be sixth-time lucky on Sunday. In this critic's opinion, she's been nominated for the wrong performance and the wrong film (""Revolutionary Road"" would have been my choice), but I've had more arguments about ""The Reader"" than any of the other contenders this year, and I suspect that there is enough support out there for a Winslet win. iReport.com: iReporter sees Streep winning . Supporting actress . I think we'll see Penelope Cruz triumph for her fabulously funny bilingual artist in Woody Allen's ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona.""

"(CNN) -- While all eyes seem to be on ""Slumdog Millionaire"" for the Oscars, one very courageous little girl will be focused on another India-based film at the ceremony. Pinki, like millions in developing countries, had to live with her deformity and suffer the social consequences. It's called ""Smile Pinki,"" and it's up for an Oscar, too -- nominated for best short documentary, which it won on Sunday. The little girl watching it from inside the Oscar ceremony has traveled all the way to Los Angeles, California, from her small Indian village with her dad -- and it has been an incredible journey for Pinki Sonkar. ""Smile Pinki"" tells the story of her transformation from a sad outcast to a vibrant 8-year-old with plenty of spunk. Pinki was born with a cleft lip, and her impoverished family did not have the money for corrective surgery. Like millions of other children born with the lip deformity in developing countries, Pinki simply had to live with it and suffer the social consequences.

"(CNN) -- Sri Lankan officials rejected a proposed cease-fire from the Tamil Tiger rebels Sunday, warning instead that government troops intended to continue a new offensive until the group surrenders, a senior government official said. Tamil demonstrators call for a cease-fire in Sri Lanka during a rally Saturday in Paris, France. ""The government is firm that (the rebels) lay down their arms and surrender. We do not recognize this so-called offer,"" said Lakshman Hulugalle, director of Sri Lanka's Media Center for National Security. The proposed cease-fire came six days after the Sri Lankan army launched a new offensive against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) in the country's northern area. Government troops made significant advances into rebel-held territory on Friday and Saturday, according to Sri Lankan Army sources. A government-imposed deadline for the Tigers to surrender passed last Tuesday. Tens of thousands of displaced civilians currently remain wedged in a dwindling swath of territory controlled by the Tigers along the country's northeastern coast. Government troops say they have rescued 39,000 civilians trapped in the area, but a U.N. refugee agency said Friday that a wave of ""fresh displacement"" has now exceeded 100,000 individuals. ""In the face of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis and in response to the calls made by the U.N., EU, the governments of the USA, India and others, the (LTTE) has announced an unilateral cease-fire. All of LTTE's offensive military operations will cease with immediate effect,"" the rebel leaders said in a written statement issued earlier Sunday. ""We welcome the attempts by the U.N. and its agencies to assist the civilian population and are ready to engage and cooperate with them to address the humanitarian needs of the population. ... We are in full agreement that the humanitarian crisis can only be overcome by declaration of an immediate cease-fire."" The Tiger leadership asked the international community to ""pressure the Sri Lankan government to reciprocate"" on the cease-fire offer. The Tigers have been fighting for an independent state in Sri Lanka's northeast since 1983. As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began, and the group has been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries, including the United States and the European Union.","Government says it will continue offensive against Tamil Tiger rebels .

"(CNN) -- A potentially deadly new strain of the swine flu virus cropped up in more places in the United States and Mexico on Saturday, in what the World Health Organization called ""a public health emergency of international concern."" Women wearing masks wait at a health clinic Saturday in Mexico City. The most recent reports Saturday afternoon were of two confirmed cases of the virus in Kansas -- bringing the number of confirmed U.S. cases to 11. Those joined nine confirmed cases in Texas and California and an apparent outbreak at a private school in New York City, where officials say eight children likely have the virus. By Saturday night, health officials in Mexico said 81 deaths there were ""likely linked"" to the swine flu. Dr. Jose A. Cordova Villalobos, Mexico's Secretary of Health, said viral testing has confirmed 20 cases of swine flu across the country. President Felipe Calderon on Saturday issued an executive decree detailing emergency powers of the Ministry of Health, according to the president's office. The order gives the ministry with the authority to isolate sick patients, inspect travelers' luggage and their vehicles and conduct house inspections, the statement said. The government also has the authority to prevent public gatherings, shut down public venues and regulate air, sea and overland travel. The WHO's Gregory Hartl said the strain of the virus seen in Mexico is worrisome because it has mutated from older strains. ""Any time that there is a virus which changes ... it means perhaps the immunities the human body has built up to dealing with influenza might not be adjusted well enough to dealing with this new virus,"" Hartl told CNN. In Mexico, otherwise young and healthy people have been hit by the virus -- ""one of the pieces of the puzzle that is worrying us,"" he said.

On Saturday, New York's Bureau of Communicable Diseases said preliminary tests from a Queens school suggest that eight out of the nine children tested probably have the swine flu virus.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The photograph is a jarring image that shows Nazi Party members, shovels in hand, digging up graves of American soldiers held as slaves by Nazi Germany during World War II. Members of the Nazi Party are forced to dig up mass graves of U.S. soldiers while American GIs look on. While the men dig up the site, U.S. soldiers investigating war crimes stand over them. Two crosses with helmets placed atop them -- the sign of a fallen soldier -- are visible. Two Germans are knee deep in mud. Another, with a handlebar mustache, has the look of a defeated man. The bodies of 22 American soldiers were found in at least seven graves, according to the photographer. On the back of the photo is written, ""Nazi Party members digging up American bodies at Berga.""   Berga an der Elster was a slave labor camp where 350 U.S. soldiers were beaten, starved, and forced to work in tunnels for the German government. The soldiers were singled out for ""looking like Jews"" or ""sounding like Jews,"" or dubbed as undesirables, according to survivors. More than 100 soldiers perished at the camp or on a forced death march. It was on this day six decades ago, April 23, 1945, when most of the slave labor camp soldiers were liberated by advancing U.S. troops. The emaciated soldiers, many weighing just 80 pounds, had been forced by Nazi commanders to march more than 150 miles before their rescue.  Watch survivor break down in tears over liberation » . The new photograph was likely taken in May or June 1945 when U.S. war crimes investigators combed Berga. It was donated earlier this month to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum by Jim Martin and his family, whose father, Elmore ""Bud"" Martin, is believed to have snapped the picture as part of the war crimes investigation team. The photo and dozens of others sat for years in Jim Martin's closet. Some of the photos, including graphic images of American corpses, were placed on record at the National Archives years ago.  See shocking photos of the slave camp » . But the image of Nazi Party members digging up graves doesn't appear to be part of that collection. Martin said he was proud to hand over the photos. ""People have to see these. This is something that's history and it belongs with something that's historical to tell that story. It doesn't belong in my closet."" ""To be honest, I'm kind of sorry I haven't done it sooner. We didn't realize what it was."" Elmore Martin, who won a Silver Star for his valor in capturing images during the war, was 28 when he shot the photographs. Before the war, he worked as a photographer for the St. Paul Dispatch and Pioneer Press. Martin's son said his dad, who died several years ago, struggled to keep a job when he returned home. ""I now see where it all started,"" he said. What Elmore Martin and the war crimes soldiers seen in the photo couldn't have known that day was how the case would evolve. The two Berga commanders -- Erwin Metz and his superior, Hauptmann Ludwig Merz -- were tried for war crimes and initially sentenced to die by hanging. But the U.S. government commuted their death sentences in 1948, and both men were eventually released in the 1950s. One other Berga commander, Lt. Willy Hack, was executed, but not by the United States. He died by hanging, justice carried out by the Soviets. Jim Martin said his father would have been upset at the freeing of the Berga commanders after the atrocities he documented. ""He knew it happened and to see that these people were released would be pretty devastating."" Efraim Zuroff, who has spent nearly 30 years hunting Nazis responsible for the Holocaust, said the U.S. government commuted the sentences and freed hundreds of war criminals like those at Berga after the war, as the Cold War began to intensify. ""They were more concerned about keeping out Communists than admitting victims of the Nazis,"" he said. ""The realities out there were very conducive of letting these people off the hook."" How should Americans feel six decades later that the government freed the Nazi commanders responsible for atrocities against U.S. soldiers? ""We're supposed to feel very pissed off about that, to be perfectly honest, and that feeling is very justified,"" Zuroff said. The German government has since made reparations to the soldiers held at Berga. Zuroff said now it's time for the U.S. government to do ""the right thing."" ""To apologize,"" he said. The Army said it is trying to figure out the best way to honor the Berga soldiers. There are about 20 known survivors still living. ""The U.S. Army honors the service and sacrifice of all veterans who have fought our nation's wars. The Army is working to identify the most dignified and personal way to honor the soldiers held at the Nazi slave camp, known as Berga,"" Army spokesman Lt. Col. Willie Harris said in a written statement. The Army refused to answer further questions about the Berga case.  Listen in as an elderly man learns about his brother's death at the camp » . Survivors have long wanted to know why the sentences of the commanders were commuted. In a letter dated June 11, 1948, to an attorney whose nephew died at Berga, the U.S. War Department said the sentences of Metz and Merz were commuted because they were ""underlings."" The letter goes on to say that Metz ""though guilty of a generally cruel course of conduct toward prisoners was not directly responsible for the death of any prisoners, except one who was killed during the course of an attempt to escape."" That soldier was Morton Goldstein. Survivors say Goldstein tried to escape but was captured. They say Metz stood him against a wall, walked up to him and shot him, execution-style, through the head. As his body lay on the ground, guards riddled him with bullets, according to survivors. The soldiers who survived were not called to testify at the war crimes trial against Metz and Merz, instead prosecutors relied on about a dozen soldiers' statements gathered through the course of the investigation. At the trial, Metz blamed any deaths at the camp on U.S. medics. ""They bore the sole responsibility for the medical care,"" Metz told the court, according to the book ""Given Up for Dead,"" by Flint Whitlock, citing trial transcripts. ""I ask you: Who must bear the responsibility? The answer is obvious: The U.S. medics."" Those comments don't sit well with Berga survivors. ""He was terrible, absolutely terrible. He lied,"" said Tony Acevedo, a U.S. medic who catalogued the deaths in a diary at the camp. ""Everybody hated his guts."" ""Even the German guards were scared of him.""  Flip through Acevedo's diary from the slave camp » . Berga survivors say they await any recognition from the Army that may come, especially after all these years. Morton Brooks, 83, said he constantly thinks about the day he was liberated. He was rail thin and had walked by political prisoners shot in the head during the forced death march. In the final hours before his rescue, his attitude was, ""Let them kill us,"" he said. ""I think all the time that I'm a survivor of this and I'm still around,"" said Brooks. ""To me, it just amazes me. I don't know how I got through."" Jim Martin said he's still trying to process his father's role as a forgotten American war hero, armed not with a gun, but a camera. ""The worst part is I'm just finding it out,"" he said.","New photo surfaces of Nazi slave labor camp where U.S. soldiers held during WWII .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A lawsuit alleging that civilian American interrogators subjected Iraqis to torture and severe mistreatment at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad can move forward, a federal judge ruled Thursday. Detainees leave Baghdad Central Prison -- also known as Abu Ghraib -- in 2006. U.S. District Court Judge Gerald Bruce Lee rejected claims by defense contractor CACI that the company was immune from accountability over claims of physical abuse, war crimes and civil conspiracy. Reports of torture and humiliation by soldiers and civilian contractors against Iraqi detainees created a political, diplomatic and public relations nightmare for the Bush administration in the months and years after the 2003 Iraq invasion. Four Iraqi detainees have sued in U.S. federal courts, alleging contract interrogators assigned to the Baghdad Central Prison -- known as Abu Ghraib -- subjected them to beatings and mental abuse, then destroyed documents and video evidence and later misled officials about what was happening inside the facility. Eleven U.S. soldiers who also worked at the prison were court-martialed under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for prisoner abuse, and several implicated company workers in similar crimes. No contractors have yet faced criminal charges in the wake of the scandal, however. Arlington, Virginia-based CACI said it was merely providing contracting services the government required, and that sensitive political and policy questions could not be brought up in any civilian trial. The judge disagreed. ""While it is true that the events at Abu Ghraib pose an embarrassment to this country, it is the misconduct alleged and not the litigation surrounding that misconduct that creates the embarrassment,"" Lee wrote. ""This court finds that the only potential for embarrassment would be if the court declined to hear these claims on political questions grounds. Consequently, the court holds that plaintiffs' claims pose no political question and are therefore justiciable."" The four Abu Ghraib detainees, led by Suhail Najim Abdullah Al Shimari, were released between 2004 and 2008, and were never charged with a crime, said their attorneys. They were represented in their civil suit by the Center for Constitutional Rights and other individual lawyers. Other Iraqi civilian lawsuits are pending. ""Private military contractors like CACI cannot act with impunity,"" said the center's Katherine Gallagher.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The alleged pirate apprehended by the U.S. Navy after the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama is en route to New York, according to defense officials. The USS Bainbridge tows the lifeboat in which Capt. Robert Phillips was held for days. He was handed over to federal authorities by the U.S. military in Djibouti, the officials said. The suspected pirate, known in official documents as ""Pirate Defendant,"" was brought to Djibouti aboard the USNS Walter S. Diehl, a refueling ship that was with the warship USS Bainbridge at the scene of the failed hijacking that turned into a hostage ordeal 350 miles off the Somalian coast. Three pirates who were holding the Maersk Alabama's captain in the ship's lifeboat were killed by Navy SEALs. The survivor had surrendered and was aboard the Bainbridge when the captain, Richard Phillips, was rescued, officials said. From the Bainbridge, he was transferred to the USS Boxer for medical treatment. He was wounded when crew members of the Maersk Alabama took him hostage in the early hours of the pirate attack on the cargo ship, according to the military.  See an interactive map of 2009 pirate attacks off the Horn of Africa » . The crew members had hoped to exchange him for their captain, but the pirates did not release Phillips when the crew returned their captive.  ""I'm mad because, you know, I could have been dead right now,"" Ken Quinn, the Maersk Alabama's navigation officer, told CNN Radio Monday. ""But at the same time he's just a little skinny guy, you know, from Somalia where they're all starving and stuff."" Quinn said he wasn't angry at the single alleged pirate, noting piracy in the region is fueled by the desire to survive hardship and poverty. He said the suspect told him he wanted to go the United States, and asked whether Quinn could help him get there. ""I said, 'Yeah, you're probably going to go anyway -- I don't think you're going to need my help,' "" Quinn said. ""If he goes to jail here, it will be a whole lot better than living in Somalia.""

"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN)  -- After 17 hours, Kerri Gannon and her husband were still stranded in an airport in Bangkok, Thailand, Wednesday, trying to find a way home to the United States after the facility was occupied by crowds of protesters and closed. Anti-government protesters gather in front of Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport early Wednesday. The newly married husband and wife, in Thailand for their  honeymoon, were struggling to find a way home to California after explosions at two Bangkok airports wounded four people and both  airports were shut down. The day before, thousands of anti-government protesters stormed the airports to protest the return of Thai Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat from an economic summit in Peru. ""The upper level outside is really crowded with protesters and for the most part they're kind of quiet and polite,"" Gannon said from the airport.  ""They're roaming the airport, they're cheering and clapping and walking around, but it's clearly their domain.""  Watch protesters clash » . It was not clear which of the two occupied airports she was speaking from, but tourists were stranded in both. The People's Alliance for Democracy , which is leading the protests, said it will not end its occupation of the airports until the prime minister resigns. They accuse his government of being a front for ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Ongoing protests caused authorities to cancel all incoming and outgoing flights at the main hub, Suvarnabhumi International Airport, which handles 60,000 incoming passengers daily, an assistant to airport director Serirat Prasutanond told CNN. Pro- and anti-government protesters also exchanged gunfire Tuesday, a Thai police official said. Protesters with golf clubs and long wooden sticks clashed with airport taxi drivers, with each side throwing objects at the other.  Watch what's causing the protests » . Protesters blockaded people trying to get to one of the airports. They directed travelers to exit onto the access roads.  See more photos » . ""I'm trying to get out of this place, but I'm stuck,"" iReporter Arjan Sing, who was on a two-week vacation to India and stopped in Bangkok to visit a friend's family. ""When we took the exit there were lots of tourists standing around wondering what they were going to do."" Gannon said the situation started off fairly relaxed, but tensions were escalating. ""As more and more tourists leave [the airport], the fact that we don't have any information and there's no one to give us information, now we feel stranded here and we don't know where to go,"" Gannon said. ""It seems a little bit more hostile than it was earlier."" Gannon said she's heard nothing from airport personnel and her quest for answers is hurt even more by the fact that many people in the airport speak no English. ""I don't know what happened to my flight,"" one woman waiting in an airport told CNN. ""They won't talk to us and I'm angry and sad because I have two small children and they're sick so we want to go home."" The airlines have also been mum on the situation, Gannon said, making it difficult for them to decide whether to wait it out at the airport or try to find a hotel. ""We've had absolutely no contact from our air carrier,"" Gannon said. ""But that seems to be universal across the board."" One traveler said the wait was frustrating. ""They've started coming through and telling us that we possibly might be out of here in the morning,"" he told CNN. ""But either way, there's no problem. We just sit here and relax and enjoy the ride."" Gannon said she and her new spouse just hope to get home sometime in the near future. ""We've been gone for 17 days and [the honeymoon] was good -- until now,"" she said. ""We are just trying to go home, get back to work and Thanksgiving.""","Airports closed after blasts, and thousands of protesters taking over .

"(Budget Travel) -- In the lodging world, green has gone mainstream. Once chided for being wasteful, the big hotel chains are now constantly trying to one-up each other with smart eco-design upgrades and stringent water and energy conservation policies. Hyatt has begun recycling its own aluminum, plastics and paper in countries where such programs don't exist. Consider this fact: In a recent survey, 68 percent of U.S. hotels said they had energy-efficient lights, and two thirds had implemented towel- and linen-reuse programs, up from just over half five years ago. The number of properties trying to become LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified, the most recognized standard for building sustainability, is also on the rise: Applications to the U.S. Green Building Council for the award spiked by 550 percent between 2006 and 2008. More than 500 hotels could soon earn the label; until four years ago, only one had the designation. Although all the major players are making strides toward better green policies, some are doing more than others. Here's what the leaders have achieved in four earth-changing categories: . ENERGY CONSERVATION . Replacing inefficient lighting, one energy-draining bulb at a time . Accor: More than 8,600 Motel 6 locations in at least a dozen states have been retrofitted with occupancy sensors that cause the thermostat to readjust when guests go out. InterContinental: A trial program has been rolled out at 650 hotels that aims to cut energy consumption by as much as 25 percent. If successful, it could be expanded to all of the chain's 4,000 properties, including Holiday Inns. Marriott: Over the past decade, 450,000 incandescent bulbs have been replaced with compact fluorescent ones, and more than 250 hotels (including some Residence Inns) have earned an Energy Star efficiency label from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Starwood: The new Element brand's goal is for every hotel to be LEED certified. Its first property, which opened last year in Lexington, Massachusetts, is fully loaded with Energy Star appliances, LED lighting, and top-notch ventilation systems. All together, that saves enough energy annually to power 236 homes. WATER CONSERVATION . Tightening up on all the drips and drops in hotel bathrooms . Hilton: The company's aim: to reduce water use at all of its brands, such as Hilton, DoubleTree, and Embassy Suites, by 10 percent by 2014. Its nearly 90 European properties have taken the lead, installing water-saving toilets, showerheads, and faucets over the past three years. Home-turf hotels are next. Hyatt: Nearly all North American properties have ""low-flow"" showerheads (which use a maximum of 2.5 gallons of water per minute) and toilets (1.6 gallons of water per flush). The improvements helped reduce the chain's overall water consumption by 3 percent in 2007. Marriott: Over the past 10 years, the company has added some 400,000 low-flow showerheads and toilets to all of its locations worldwide. Marriott also buys 1 million towels annually that don't require prewashing, conserving 6 million gallons of water each year. Starwood: All new Element hotels will have low-flow water fixtures in rooms and water-efficient landscaping; its Lexington star has led the way, saving up to 1 million gallons of water per year. GREEN DESIGN . Thinking about the environment from the foundation up . Accor: The Motel 6 brand broke ground last year on an ultra-green building near Dallas, with laminate flooring made from recycled wood chips and a solar-powered water-heating system. Best Western: Opening this year in Golden, Colorado, the chain's first LEED-certified hotel will run partially on solar power and have a porous asphalt parking lot to reduce storm-water runoff. Hilton: The company's green gem is in Vancouver, Washington: a LEED-approved hotel with low-emission paint on the walls and special drains that funnel rainwater into wells for future use. Hyatt: Seattle's Hyatt at Olive 8, which opened in January, has an 8,000-square-foot rooftop garden, water-efficient dual-flush toilets, outlets in the parking lot for electric cars, and lighting controlled by room key cards. Marriott: In 2005, the Marriott in College Park, Maryland, was the first chain hotel in the U.S. to become LEED certified. Among the earth-friendly frills: kitchen composting, in-room recycling bins, water pitchers instead of plastic bottles, and an organic restaurant. Starwood: All eight Element locations being built across the country this year have carpets and cushions made from recycled materials, art mounted on frames constructed from old tires, and priority parking for guests with hybrids. RECYCLING . Allowing not a single can, bottle, or plastic key card to go to waste . Hyatt: Starting this year, the company will only use key cards and shampoo and lotion containers made from recycled plastics. Hyatt has also begun recycling its own aluminum, plastics, and paper in countries such as Russia and Chile where such programs don't exist. Intercontinental: As part of a pilot program started two years ago, about 140 Candlewood Suites properties donated old furniture and linens to local families following renovations -- helping to cut back on landfill. It hopes to replicate the initiative nationwide. Marriott: Each year, the chain buys 47 million pens and 24 million key cards made from recycled plastics; it has also eliminated Styrofoam and plastic utensils at all of its locations. Coming soon: bed pillows made from the polyester fibers of recycled plastic bottles. Wyndham: Debuting later this year at Super 8 motels across the country: new staff uniforms fashioned entirely from recycled plastic bottles.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British broadcaster Channel 4 has been criticized for creating a new television show which looks at how children as young as eight would cope without their parents for two weeks. Channel 4 said the program was made with the parents' full consent. Boys And Girls Alone -- which will be aired in the UK on Tuesday evening -- has been compared to adult reality show Big Brother. The show allows 10 boys and 10 girls between the age of eight and 11 to create their own mini-societies, organizing everything from what they eat to how they should entertain themselves. Ultimately the children are shown on camera squabbling over sleeping and cooking arrangements and, as they split into factions, some of them feel ""picked on,"" the show's publicity says. This has led to a stream of criticism from British lawmakers and children's charities, who have labeled Channel 4's ""experiment"" a disgrace that ""served no purpose other than to cynically boost ratings,"" according to Britain's Daily Mirror newspaper. Camila Batmanghelidjh, of the charity Kids Company, was quoted by The Daily Mirror as saying: ""Any situation that leaves a group of young people without the mediating presence of a responsible adult is cruel and abusive."" Do you agree? Share your views . Labour MP Denis MacShane told the newspaper that ""children should be protected and not exploited for commercial gain."" However, Channel 4 defended the show and said it features ""the kind of tussling you'd get in any playground -- but no physical violence."" It added that one boy pointed a knife and fork during the series but emphasized that no one was in any danger, Britain's Press Association reported. ""This is not a project for commercial gain. It is done with the parents' full consent,"" a Channel 4 spokesperson was quoted by PA as saying. ""They were watching and there were mentors and a clinical psychologist who made sure there were no problems.""","Boys And Girls Alone has been compared to adult reality show Big Brother .

"(CNN) -- It arrived in Rich Stevens' mailbox a few weeks ago: the notice that Citibank had ""rate-jacked"" the Visa cards belonging to him and his wife. Some credit card holders have seen their interest rates go up dramatically, a practice called ""rate-jacking."" ""In my case, from 9.5 percent to 16.99,"" the 54-year-old nurse from the Long Island hamlet of Merrick, New York, told CNN. And his wife's rate zoomed from 7.95 percent to 16.99 percent, he said. Stevens said he did not know why the rates had soared; his credit rating is great. But, like thousands of other credit card customers around the nation, he has been notified his rate is skyrocketing. ""It almost borders on loan-sharking, from my perspective,"" he said. In the blogosphere, writers are livid at the instant rate hikes -- called ""rate-jacking."" Citigroup seems to be the target of most bloggers' venom -- partly because Citigroup issues so many credit cards and partly because Citi began sending the notices at about the same time it was getting a $20 billion, taxpayer-financed government bailout. No one at Citigroup would talk on camera to CNN about the matter. Instead, the company issued a written statement, which said: ""To continue funding in this difficult credit and funding environment, Citi is repricing a group of customers."" Citi told CNN that anyone unhappy with the new rates can opt out and continue paying the lower interest, but they must close their account when their card expires. It's all in the fine print. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-New York, said she is sick of the fine print. She agreed that credit card companies get away with whatever they want, as long at they put their desires into the fine print. ""They have this provision that says they can raise the rate -- any time, any reason,"" she said. In September, Maloney got the House to pass by an overwhelming margin of 200 votes the ""credit card holders' bill of rights,"" which would have stopped rate-jacking and the imposition of other fees by banks. But the bill has languished in the Senate since September. ""There's a lot of pushback from the financial industry,"" she said.  Watch how card companies are trying to woo customers » . Critics say that pushback is linked to donations from the banking industry to the politicians responsible for regulating credit cards. The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee is Christopher Dodd. His staff said the Connecticut Democrat has his own credit card bill containing tough language to stop things like rate-jacking and shortening of billing cycles -- two issues that anger consumers. But even Dodd's own bill has failed to gain traction -- it has sat since July. Dodd himself received more than $4 million from the financial sector during the last campaign, according to campaign records. His office did not respond to CNN's questions about that. It did say that he has tried repeatedly to protect consumers, but added, ""legislation has been met with stiff opposition by the credit card industry."" On Thursday, the Federal Reserve is expected to vote on its own new rules regarding credit cards, rules in the works for four years that could clamp down on rate-jacking. Whatever is passed, Maloney said, probably would not take effect until 2010.","One man's rate went from 9.5% to 16.99%: ""It almost borders on loan-sharking""

"(CNN) -- John McCain tried to make Barack Obama's celebrity status a campaign issue last summer, but there's no debate about the president-elect's ability to draw famous and talented Americans to his inauguration. Bruce Springsteen campaigns for Barack Obama in Cleveland, Ohio, on November 2, 2008. Dozens of major celebrities will perform on several nationally televised shows, as well as 10 inaugural balls the evening after Obama is sworn in as the 44th U.S. president. The celebration will open Sunday evening on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial with a free concert so star-studded it's hard to choose a headliner. Beyonce, Bono and Bruce Springsteen are on the list. Other musical performers include Mary J. Blige, Garth Brooks, Sheryl Crow, Renee Fleming, Josh Groban, Herbie Hancock, Heather Headley, John Legend, Jennifer Nettles, John Mellencamp, Usher Raymond IV, Shakira, James Taylor, will.i.am, and Stevie Wonder. In addition, Jamie Foxx, Martin Luther King III, Queen Latifah and Denzel Washington will take the stage to deliver historical readings. More performers will likely be named. Executive Producer George Stevens Jr. said the intention is ""to root the event in history, celebrating the moments when our nation has united to face great challenges and prevail.""  See how inaugurations have changed over the years » . Don Mischer, who directed the opening ceremony of the 1996 Olympics and ` recent Super Bowl half-time shows, is directing this event. ""We will have the statue of Abraham Lincoln looking down on our stage and a crowd of hundreds of thousands of people lining the mall -- a tableau any director would relish,"" Mischer said. Admission will be free, but security will be tight. Check out an interactive map of Washington . Five gates leading into the area, including one around the Reflecting Pool at the base of the Lincoln Memorial, open at 8 a.m. ET Sunday. Performances start at 2:30 p.m. HBO paid for exclusive rights to televise Sunday's show, but its feed will be free to all cable and satellite viewers from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. ET. It cannot be seen through local broadcast television stations. The Disney Channel will carry Monday night's big event -- ""Kids' Inaugural: We Are The Future"" -- from 8 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. ET. Those who don't have cable will be able to hear it live on Radio Disney or watch it online later at Disney.com. Musical performers will include the Jonas Brothers, Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato and Bow Wow. Singer-actress Keke Palmer -- star of Nickelodeon's ""True Jackson, VP"" -- is one of the hosts for the show, which will be staged in Washington's Verizon Center. Palmer, 15, hopes to meet Obama's daughters Sasha, 7, and Malia, 10, backstage Monday night. Palmer said she moved from Chicago to Los Angeles when she was about the same age as Malia is now, and Obama's election is ""very special for my family and me, being from Chicago and all."" ""I also feel like I know what Sasha and Malia are experiencing in terms of leaving Chicago at an early age, having to attend a brand new school, a new house, just new everything,"" Palmer said. ""It's not easy, but as long as you have great parents, which we all three have, then it turns out OK."" There should be plenty of celebrity sightings at the swearing-in ceremony at noon ET Tuesday or in the parade starting at 2:30 p.m. Viewers will have no trouble finding a television broadcast of those events. Palmer said she will likely view the inaugural parade from a viewing stand at the Pennsylvania Avenue headquarters of the National Council of Negro Women. ""Hey, either way I'm so happy to be a part of it no matter how small,"" she said. ""This is historic!"" While inaugural ball tickets are tough to get, one of the 10 balls Tuesday evening will be shown live on ABC television from 8 to 10 p.m. ET. ""The Neighborhood Ball: An Inauguration Celebration"" is billed by planners as ""the premier event of the inauguration evening."" Beyonce, Mary J. Blige, Mariah Carey, Faith Hill, Jay-Z, Alicia Keys, Shakira, Stevie Wonder and others yet to be announced will perform live at the ball. The Neighborhood Ball will take place in a hall at the Washington Convention Center, the venue for four other balls.  Take a quiz about first ladies' inaugural gowns » .

"(CNN) -- Watch out! Lock up your loved ones! Another bloated, over-produced, high-concept monstrosity has escaped from the labs at Dreamworks Animation, and it's out to devour your kids. Susan, aka ""Ginormica,"" has to save the world in ""Monsters vs. Aliens."" But don't be too alarmed. ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is relatively harmless -- a toothless satire with a knee-jerk feminist theme and a sorry excuse for a plot. That sounds harsh, I know. Who doesn't want to see a 50-foot woman careening through San Francisco on skates that turn out to be automobiles -- the ultimate demolition roller derby? But think about that, just for a second. Roller skates work because they have fixed wheels. Try it with motorcars and you won't get very far. Is that too picky? Perhaps, but you wouldn't find Pixar playing so fast and loose with the laws of physics, and that kind of inattention to detail is typical of the lackadaisical storytelling here and in other Dreamworks animated features. (The talent pool for this one includes the directors of ""Shrek 2"" and ""Shark Tale"" and the writers of ""Kung Fu Panda"" and ""The Rocker,"" incidentally.) High concepts, top-notch voice talent and scattershot pop cultural references are no compensation for a coherent script. The XXXL lady in question -- dubbed ""Ginormica"" by her U.S. military guards -- starts out plain and petite Susan Murphy (voiced by Reese Witherspoon), until a meteorite hits her just minutes before she's supposed to tie the knot with unctuous chauvinist Derek (Paul Rudd). Her rapid growth spurt saves her from that particular fate worse than death, even if at first glance her new roommates don't look like much of an improvement. There's Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie), a mad scientist who semi-advertently mutated with a bug; B.O.B. (Seth Rogen) an amorphous blue jelly-like blob who gets on just fine without a brain; Missing Link (Will Arnett), a gung-ho amphibian who's all mouth; and a giant dust mite called Insectosaurus who isn't voiced by anyone because he doesn't have anything to say. Sci-fi fans will have fun counting off the references to myriad classics -- ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" ""Invaders from Mars,"" ""The Fly,"" ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon,"" ""The Blob,"" ""Mothra"" and ""Attack of the 50-Foot Woman,"" for starters -- and noting a few clever bits and pieces (Kiefer Sutherland, as General W.R. Monger, riffs on George C. Scott in ""Dr. Strangelove""). The trouble is, once the introductions are over, the filmmakers can only launch their desperately limp plot: The White House turns to these monstrous superheroes to save the planet from evil Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson), a squidlike creature with four eyes and twice as many legs, and a one-eyed tin robot to do his dirty work for him. Ginormica gets a kick-butt finale, and is a much stronger character -- in any number of ways -- than the movie's president. (In a genuinely witty casting touch he's voiced by Stephen Colbert.) That may be good politics or at least a sound marketing decision from the studio's perspective -- it's been awhile since a family animated feature produced a genuinely strong female character (unless you count ""Coraline,"" which was way too scary for my family) -- but Susan's self-esteem is an awfully long time coming. iReport.com: What do you think of 'Monsters vs. Aliens'? (Bizarrely -- and maybe it's just my imagination -- Gallaxhar bears a passing resemblance to President Obama. I wonder ... would that make Susan/Ginormica a surrogate for Sarah Palin or Hillary Clinton?) Visually, too, ""Monsters vs Aliens"" is undistinguished, although its shortcomings may be disguised if you seek out the 3-D version. Funny how 3-D movies tend to produce two-dimensional characters, with ""Coraline"" again the exception to the rule. Jocular and unpretentiously trashy, ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" should be a lot of fun -- and it is, in places. But the truth is it's as hung up on itself as Susan's preening fiance. Hand on heart, I had a better time at ""Space Chimps."" ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" runs 94 minutes and is rated PG.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- More than 170 people around the globe, including at least 61 in the United States, have been arrested in a major operation targeting international child pornographers, officials said Friday. Attorney General Michael Mukasey and European Union representatives announced the sting's results Friday. Operation Joint Hammer has rescued 11 girls in the United States, ages 3 to 13, who were sexually abused by child pornography producers, U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey and representatives of the European Union said at the Justice Department. Dozens more were located in Europe, including several young female victims in Ukraine. Authorities found connections between producers, distributors and customers in nearly 30 countries as a single investigation grew to a global inquiry into the dark corners of brutality and child abuse. The investigation, code-named Operation Koala in Europe, was developed when investigators determined that a pornographic video found in Australia had been produced in Belgium. ""This joint EU-U.S. coordinated effort began with the discovery in Europe of a father who was sexually abusing his young daughters and producing images of that abuse,"" Mukasey said. Further investigation showed a number of online child porn rings. Some included dangerous offenders who not only traded child pornography but also sexually abused children, the officials said. Agents are still attempting to locate child victims whose images have appeared in photos and videos, and more arrests are expected as the FBI, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Postal Inspection Service continue the investigation. A Postal Service official said ringleaders primarily targeted prepubescent female victims to satisfy their customers but noted that other groups produce photos and videos of boys and girls of all ages -- or even infants. ""For this subset, that's what turns them on,"" the official said.","U.S., European officials join for child pornographer sting .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- London's subway system was engulfed by thousands of revelers Saturday night, marking the introduction of an alcohol ban on the mass transit network. Revelers hit London's subway system Saturday night to mark the introduction of an alcohol ban. Eyewitnesses have described how some drunken partygoers, often dressed in fancy dress, fought, damaged subway trains and vomited. Authorities were forced to close six stations on the network, including major transportation hubs at Liverpool Street, Baker Street and Euston. A spokesman for British Transport Police, which patrols the network, said that police had been told of a large ""large amount"" of disorder and ""multiple instances of trains being damaged"", causing them to be pulled from service, the UK's Press Association reported, adding: ""This was an unfortunate end to what should have been a fun event."" There were reports of at least 17 arrests. Much of the disorder concentrated on the Circle Line, which encircles the center of the city. Many reports say that the night had begun good-naturedly. Web programmer, David Mudkips, 25, from east London, told PA that the event was ""Like rush hour but fun. There were people's sweaty armpits in my face but I didn't care because I was drinking."" Student Frankie Abbott, 21, also from east London, said earlier in the evening: ""It might be fun to do the whole night but I think it's going to get a bit messy. There are guys drinking from funnels already."" Sailor Peter Moore, 35, from Brighton on the southern English coast, told the agency his night was ""Drunken, I just downed a can of beer in 10 seconds. It's sweaty on there but I'm going round and round until I vomit."" As the evening progressed the situation deteriorated. Photographer Desmond Fitzgerald, 48, from south London, told PA that by 11pm at Gloucester Road subway station he was afraid someone might slip onto the tracks due to the amount of spilt alcohol on the platform. ""At first the atmosphere was happy but anarchic, defiant,"" he said, with people wearing hats and having a good time. As the journey progressed, more heavily drunk people joined the train, he added. ""Then a fight broke out between about five people, but because we were so tightly packed in it soon spread throughout the carriage and I had to struggle to escape to the next one,"" he told PA. ""The atmosphere had really changed by this point. People were ripping off adverts and maps and being sick all over the place. ""When it pulled in to Embankment people fell out and carried on fighting on the platform. Thankfully police were there, and they handled it very well."" Many of those gathered had learnt of the party on social networking Web sites, through groups with names such as ""Circle Line Party - Last day of drinking on the tube"", which had 850-plus members listed by Saturday lunchtime, and ""Party/Flashmob on the Underground"", with 1,300-plus names listed. The anti-drinking strategy was introduced by newly elected London mayor Boris Johnson. He said before the party occurred: ""I'm determined to improve the safety and security of public transport in London and create a better environment for the millions of Londoners who rely on it. The ban has the full support of the Metropolitan Police and British Transport Police. ""I firmly believe that banning the drinking of alcohol on London's public transport will create a better traveling environment for all Londoners and that if we drive out antisocial behavior and so called minor crime then we will be able to get a firm grip on more serious crime."" But Bob Crow, General Secretary of the Rail Maritime and Transport Union of which many subway staff are members, countered that the ban put workers at greater risk of of attack, reported PA, saying it was ""half-baked.""","Revelers mark alcohol ban on London subway system, cause chaos .

"LANCASTER, California (CNN) -- The sound of pounding hooves thunders in the high desert air. A cloud of dust marks the trail of a herd of wild horses as they race across the arid plain. This is Lifesavers Wild Horse Rescue, a shelter for wild mustangs and unwanted horses near Lancaster, California. Jill Starr, president of Lifesavers Wild Horse Rescue, vows to do right by the horses: ""I will take care of them."" Lifesavers President Jill Starr says she and other shelter operators are witnessing an equine crisis. ""People have lost their homes, their jobs, their hope,"" she said. ""And they are giving up their animals."" ""We've had horses come onto the property in a horse trailer, unannounced, and just offloaded and [owners] ask us, beg us, if we could take these skinny horses,"" she said. Starr says she has taken in so many unwanted horses in the past year that her resources are stretched to the breaking point.  Watch rescue center that cares for horses » . ""All of a sudden it's like somebody flipped a switch and people started bringing back the horses they adopted from us,"" she said. ""There are no hard numbers on this,"" said Michael Markarian of the Humane Society of the United States. ""The states don't seem to be keeping numbers. The economy has been hard on everybody, and animals are no exception."" Shannon Bonfanti is a case in point. A freelance fashion industry worker, Bonfanti says that jobs have dried up, and so has her income. ""When I was working I was able to take care of all the expenses,"" she said. But she has since decided to sell three of the six horses in her stable -- to save her family as much as $800 a month. ""How do you sell your kids?"" a tearful Bonfanti asked. So far, Bonfanti has found no buyers. Not even for Hunni, a horse that has won trophies and ribbons in national riding competitions. ""I'm willing to take almost any offer,"" Bonfanti said. ""I know my trainer would say I'm crazy. 'You can't give that horse away. She is valuable.' "" Bonfanti even considered the county animal shelter as a possible solution. ""I had contacted a few people,"" she said. ""And the factor that there is the possibility that a horse could be put down made me look further."" Last year, the Los Angeles County shelter took in 188 abandoned or abused horses -- up 600 percent from the previous year. Veterinarian David Byerly says the numbers are even worse this year. ""It has not leveled off in any way,"" Byerly said. ""It just keeps going up."" Byerly says that for the first time, the county has had to euthanize abandoned horses because its facilities are full. Horses considered likely adoption candidates are spared. Even so, the Los Angeles County animal shelter is killing abandoned horses at a rate of three or four a week. That is not a fate that James Gulledge wants for his horse, Rico. Gulledge says he first met Rico at the Lifesavers shelter. ""I was volunteering over there and just fell in love with him,"" he said. But now the economy is forcing some hard choices. ""I'm very conflicted about it,"" Gulledge said. ""It's just a decision about paying for him or having some money to help some important people make it through all this."" Gulledge chose to return Rico to Lifesavers. For Starr, the horse is one more mouth to feed, and she intends to. ""I'm hoping that this is the worst of this, that we are going to climb out of this pretty soon,"" she said. In the meantime, she said, ""I will take care of them and won't let anything bad happen to them. ... They're basically family members.""","Lifesavers Wild Horse Rescue, a shelter for unwanted horses, stretched to the limit .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama takes his first stab Wednesday night at the role of fundraiser in chief. President Obama raised lots of money as he campaigned, but how will he do now that the election is over? The president is the main attraction at two events in the nation's capital for the Democratic National Committee, making for the first fundraising test for Obama since he took over the presidency two months ago. As a candidate for the White House, Obama, who was then a senator from Illinois, had little trouble raising money: He broke all fundraising records, raking in nearly $750 million during his two-year campaign for the presidency. The money raised at Wednesday night's two events -- at the National Women in the Arts Museum and the Warner Theater, where singer Tony Bennett is scheduled to perform -- will come in handy as the Democratic National Committee struggles to keep pace with its Republican counterpart. Democrats won back the White House and increased their majorities in Congress in November's elections, but when it comes to campaign cash, the national party is not having the same kind of success. The DNC raised about $3.3 million last month, while the Republican National Committee raked in more than $5 million. Thanks to a larger transfer of campaign cash left over from Obama's presidential run, the DNC was able to report $5.4 million in total contributions last month, slightly edging out the RNC. But when it comes to cash on hand -- the amount of money the parties have in the bank -- the DNC's $8.5 million trails the RNC's $24 million. DNC Chairman Tim Kaine on Tuesday dismissed the committee's disappointing February cash haul, saying that his fundraising efforts were handicapped by a Virginia law that prohibits officials from raising money during the state's legislative session. ""Fundraising stories don't interest me that much,"" Kaine said, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. ""I was unable to raise any money in February, by law."" Kaine, who is DNC chairman while finishing out his term as Virginia's governor, wrapped up work with the state's General Assembly on February 28. ""That is the reason that the numbers aren't going to be what they're going to be in future months,"" said Kaine, who became DNC chairman in late January. Kaine said that observers should ""stay tuned"" now that he's free to solicit donations. ""Historically, the Republican Party has almost always out-raised the Democratic Party, regardless of who sat in the Oval Office. It wasn't until the 2004 cycle that the DNC was able to barely out-raise the RNC. So the fact that Democrats haven't brought in as much this year as the GOP isn't necessarily a huge surprise,"" said Robert Yoon, the CNN Political Unit's research director. The president's appearances at the fundraisers come on the same day he spent some political capital, for the first time since taking over the White House, in an effort to get another Democrat elected. Obama e-mailed New York Democrats endorsing Scott Murphy, the venture capitalist who is running in the special election to fill the seat in New York's 20th Congressional District that was vacated by Kirsten Gillibrand when she was appointed to the U.S. Senate in January. Murphy's Republican opponent in next Tuesday's election is is New York assemblyman Jim Tedisco. Though the Democratic and Republican campaign committees in the House of Representatives have pumped resources into the race, the president had so far kept his distance. In fact, the president has largely avoided overtly political events since his inauguration two months ago. Last week, that began to change: He sent a video to millions of his supporters through the e-mail distribution list of Organizing for America, the remnant of his presidential campaign that is now under the umbrella of the DNC. With Democrats hoping to defend two governorships this November, the party hopes that the president will be able to bring in the big bucks. ""Controlling the White House is still a big plus when it comes to fundraising. In the last midterms, President Bush raised at least $170 million on behalf of Republican candidates and party committees, even while his personal approval ratings were relatively low,"" Yoon said. ""So there's no doubt that President Obama can give the party a huge fundraising boost if he hits the campaign trail and stumps for other Democrats.""","Obama broke fundraising records during general election .

"(CNN) -- Environmental activist Erin Brockovich was in Kingston, Tennessee, on Thursday to speak with residents affected by a massive spill of coal sludge from a nearby coal-fired plant. Properties near ground zero of the December 22 Tennessee spill are covered in sludge. Brockovich said many people in the community told her they don't feel they've been told the truth about the December 22 spill that occurred after a retention wall was breached at the Kingston Fossil Plant. She quoted citizens as saying they don't get satisfactory answers or they get inconsistent answers when they call the the plant's owner, Tennessee Valley Authority. ""They don't have the answers and they're very, very concerned,"" Brockovich said. ""So we're here to address all of that and begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together."" Brockovich, who said she was invited to the community by residents, planned to meet with them Thursday night. A public meeting is scheduled for Friday night. She hopes people will come to the meetings and air their concerns. She said she will tour the site on the ground and from the air. Brockovich gained fame after the 2000 release of the movie bearing her name. It told the story of how she, as a file clerk at a law firm, established that a toxic chemical from the Pacific Gas and Electric Company's compressor station leaked into the groundwater of a nearby town, compromising the health of hundreds, according to a biography posted on Brockovich's Web site. In 1996, the company paid the largest toxic tort settlement in U.S. history -- $333 million -- to more than 600 Hinkley residents, the Web site said. About 1.1 billion gallons of sludge, or ash mixed with water, spilled onto 300 acres from the plant located 40 miles west of Knoxville, Tennessee. That is enough sludge to fill 1,660 Olympic-size swimming pools. Fly ash is a byproduct of burning coal. Brockovich said residents have sent her photos showing fly ash up to 2 feet deep in places. She said citizens are worried about contact with the fly ash, including its impact on the water supply. Last week, authorities said drinking water in the area was potable, although samples of ash near the site showed ""elevated levels"" of arsenic. Leslie Sims, the Environmental Protection Agency on-scene coordinator, said the Tennessee Valley Authority is addressing the issue. ""I don't think TVA can move fast enough to possibly satisfy these people,"" said Brockovich, noting that she hasn't spoken with anyone from the TVA. TVA, the nation's largest public utility, promised to do whatever it takes to clean the spill in central Tennessee. Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen promised state government will keep a close watch on TVA's cleanup.","Environmental activist says people affected by coal sludge spill feel misled .

"(OPRAH.com) -- One of the original Kings of Comedy, Steve Harvey is the host of one of the most popular radio shows in the country, ""The Steve Harvey Morning Show."" His first book, ""Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man,"" is shooting to the top of the best-seller lists, and Oprah Winfrey says she loves everything it has to say! Harvey says this book has a special meaning for him. ""This is the first project that I didn't do for money,"" he says. ""Other than my foundation -- mentoring programs -- everything I do is for money. I tell jokes for a check; I'm on TV for a check. ... But this [book] right here I did purely to empower women."" In his book, Harvey says the way a man introduces you gives good insight into the status of your relationship. If a man introduces you as a friend or says your name with no title at all, Harvey says you have nothing. ""We're very protective. We mark our territory. If a man loves you...he's willing to profess it. He'll give you a title after a while. You're going to be his lady, his woman, his fiancée, his wife, his baby's mama, something,"" he says. ""If he's introducing you after six months, 'This is...Oprah,' you should be standing there going, 'This is going nowhere.'""  Oprah.com: Read an excerpt from this best-selling book! Man with a plan . Another thing women need to understand, according to Harvey, is that every man has a plan. ""Men don't come up to you to just talk. We come up to you with a plan,"" he says. ""We're looking across the room at you, and we don't care about your hopes and dreams. We don't care about what your future holds. We saw something we wanted."" When a man approaches a woman, Harvey says, he already knows what we wants from her, but he doesn't know what it will cost. ""How much time do you want from me? What your standards? What are your requirements? Because we'll rise to the occasion no matter how high you set the bar if we want to,"" he says. ""The problem is, women have stopped setting the bar high."" Oprah.com: What's your love type? The cookie . Though a woman might want many things from a man, Harvey says men only need three things: support, loyalty and sex. Or as Harvey calls it, ""the cookie."" ""We've got to have your support. Whatever adventure we're out on, whatever pursuit in life, we need your support. Then we need your loyalty. That's your love. We've got to know that you belong to us,"" he says. ""And we've got to have a cookie. Everybody likes cookies. That's the thing about a cookie. I like oatmeal raisin...but if you've got vanilla cream, I'll eat that too."" Kickin' it . In his book, Harvey tells the story of his father-in-law's first introduction to one of Harvey's daughter's boyfriends. ""[My 26-year-old daughter] was dating this guy who was about 30. He had been over to the house about four, five times. And my father-in-law was visiting from Memphis,"" Harvey says. ""He's in the kitchen and he's eating and [my daughter's] boyfriend is in there, and [my father-in-law] goes: 'So, son, sit down. Tell me, what's your plan for my granddaughter?'"" After plenty of hemming and hawing, Harvey says the boyfriend finally said that the two were just ""kickin' it."" Harvey was pretty confident his daughter didn't have the same interpretation of the relationship, he says. ""I said: 'Cool. Let's bring my daughter in there. Let's inform her that she's just being kicked...let's see if that's what she wants to do,"" he says. ""They broke up the next day."" Gone fishin' Harvey says men are like fishermen -- but women are actually the ones looking for a good catch. You won't be able to find one, though, until you up your standards. ""You've got sports fishermen, and you've got guys out there fishing to eat. You've got guys that are fishing to keep the fish, and you've got guys that are fishing to catch them, unhook them and throw them back,"" Harvey says. ""You've got to determine along the way which one of the fish you're going to be."" Without ironclad standards, Harvey says you'll always end up back in the dating pool. ""You've got to quit lowering your standards,"" he says. ""Set your requirements up front so when a guy hooks you, he has to know this is business."" And don't let the man set the pace of the relationship -- Harvey says it's always the woman who has total control. ""With all that power, why do you suddenly relinquish this power just because you want a guy to accept you? That's stupid,"" he says. ""Say: 'Look, if you want to be with me, this is what you got to do. This is what it takes to get to me.'"" When should you sleep with your new boyfriend? As an auto plant worker, Harvey says he had to wait 90 days to receive benefits -- and says the same probation period should apply to dating. ""In 90 days they checked me out. They determined if I was easy to work with, if I got along well with others, if I showed up when I said I was going to show up, if I was worthy."" Women, Harvey says, hold the greatest benefit of all -- the cookie -- so there's no reason to give it away until you know your man deserves it. ""Slow down, ladies,"" Harvey says. ""Look, you cannot run us off."" So what if you don't want to wait 90 days? Harvey says if you change the probation period, you do so at your own risk. ""You all keep changing the rules. And men are aware of the fact that you are changing the rules. We're aware of the fact that you act desperate. We're aware of the fact that you think there's a good shortage of good men out there,"" he says. ""We play on all of that. ... We created the term 'gold digger' so you won't ask us for nothing. We created the term 'nagging' so you can quit badgering us. These are terms that we created so you can require less of us."" Mr. fix-it . Harvey says four little words can strike fear and dread into any man: We need to talk. ""You just drove a nail in his forehead,"" Harvey says. Men are fixers, not talkers, Harvey says, so it's better to get to the point. ""When you say, 'We need to talk,' we put up the barriers,"" he says. ""I tell ladies, just sit down and strike up a conversation."" Oprah.com: How to talk to a brick wall . Turn off the text . Social networking Web sites and text messages can be a great way to keep in touch with friends, but Harvey says it's not the best way to date. ""You have nothing if you're texting a guy in a relationship,"" he says. ""We can text six women a minute. We can text it and push 'reply all.' I mean, since we're lying, we might as well lie to everybody."" If you want the relationship to be more, take it face-to-face. ""Women talk about [how] chivalry's dead. Chivalry's not dead -- it's just not required anymore,"" he says. ""You've got to get a guy in your face. Look in his eyes. ... God has given you all this incredible thing called intuition. You've got to use that."" Safety first . You know you've got a keeper when your man wants to make sure you're always safe, Harvey says. Every man wants to protect his woman, and Harvey says this instinct kicks in when his wife, Marjorie, scuba dives. ""I can't go home without her. We've got seven kids between us,"" Harvey says. ""They need their mother. I'm not a good mother at all."" Although Marjorie is a certified diver, Harvey isn't a swimmer. ""I have a security guy who can swim,"" he says. ""So [he puts] on the snorkeling gear and when she goes down, I tell him, 'You swim over and just keep an eye on my wife.'"" Harvey also has instructions for everyone else on the boat. ""I told all the dive masters on the boat: 'If she does not come out of that water in 30 minutes, everybody in the water. Everybody. We're doing a dive search right here,'"" he says.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The crew of a commuter plane that crashed outside Buffalo, New York, in February may have responded improperly to signs the plane was stalling, according to details of the investigation released Wednesday. Only a few pieces of the Continental Connection Dash 8 turboprop were recognizable after the crash. The crew of Continental Connection Flight 3407 pulled back on the plane's control column when it received a stall warning, pulling the plane upward, an update released by the National Transportation Safety Board revealed. That would have aggravated the situation rather than improving it, according to a veteran pilot contacted by CNN. But investigators are far from determining the exact cause of the crash, the NTSB said. And Colgan Air, the plane's operator, urged the public not to jump to conclusions. The Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 crashed into a house about six miles from Buffalo-Niagara International Airport the night of February 12. All 49 people on the plane and one man who was in the house were killed. The pilot and first officer discussed ""significant"" ice buildup on the aircraft's windshield and wings before the crash, the cockpit voice recorder revealed. But in an update on the investigation, the NTSB said there is no indication that aircraft's systems failed, or that ice had a significant impact on the plane. The NTSB said a stall warning device known as a ""stick shaker"" appears to have behaved properly, activating when the plane's speed dropped to 130 knots (150 mph). At that point, however, ""there was a 25-pound pull force on the control column,"" pulling the plane upward, and data suggests there was a ""likely separation of the airflow over the wing"" -- meaning the plane had stalled. ""The circumstances of the crash have raised several issues that go well beyond the widely discussed matter of airframe icing,"" the NTSB's acting chairman, Mark Rosenker, said in a statement on the findings. In general, when a stick shaker activates, pilots are taught to apply full power and maintain the plane's altitude or lower the nose, a captain for a major airline told CNN. ""What you don't want to do is aggravate the situation,"" said the pilot, who would not be named because he had not sought approval from his airline. ""By pulling it up without adding power, you're aggravating the situation."" The safety board said it intends to investigate ""stall recovery training"" among other issues at a three-day public hearing it will offer on the crash in mid-May. Doug Moss, a United Air Lines pilot and aerospace consultant, said that appears to be what the NTSB ""is really looking at."" ""It's easy to build a lot of experience in airline flying without ever getting close to the edges of the envelope,"" he said. In a statement issued Wednesday afternoon, Colgan Air said the NTSB data does not pinpoint a cause, and its crews ""are prepared to handle emergency situations they might face."" ""We stand by our FAA-certified crew training programs which meet or exceed the regulatory requirements for all major airlines and include training on emergency situations,"" the Virginia-based carrier said. Colgan Air said it is ""cooperating thoroughly"" with the investigation. ""The only absolute fact is that we do not know the cause of this accident,"" it said. Information released Wednesday appears to count out one possibility that was the subject of speculation after the crash: a stall induced by ice on the aircraft's tail. Pilots say those stalls are particularly insidious because pilots cannot see the tail wings and because the recovery procedure is the opposite of a main-wing stall -- tail-wing stalls generally are overcome by raising the plane's nose. The NTSB said that toxicology tests of the flight crew were negative for alcohol or illicit substances. The captain tested positive for diltiazem, a prescription blood pressure medication the Federal Aviation Administration had permitted him to use. At the board's hearing in May, the NTSB will look into a number of topics, including the effect of ice on the aircraft's performance, cold weather operations, the crew's experience and sleep issues. The board also will investigate ""sterile cockpit rules,"" or requirements that crews discuss only aircraft issues during critical phases of flight, such as take-offs and landings.

"(CNN) -- Yes, it's a limited sample. Yes, it's more likely for people who are disgruntled to comment than people who are pleased. Bruce Springsteen expressed strong reservations about a possible Ticketmaster-Live Nation merger. But still: CNN.com users who responded to our iReport and blog queries about the possible Ticketmaster-Live Nation merger were really, really unhappy. ""Put 'going to a rock concert' on your list of 'Things you used to do, but can't anymore,' along with watching free television, seeing a double-feature with a cartoon, and riding a train cross country,"" wrote Carlos Sandoval. ""Ahh, the beginning of yet another monopoly. I hope the feds nix this one,"" added RJ. ""Ticketmaster is already nearly a monopoly in the ticket game. Live Nation is built on greed. Might be a marriage made in heaven for them, but it's a marriage made in hell for the concert-going public,"" wrote Allison. Many who commented were compelled to share their horror stories, of which there were many. ""I was recently at a concert where I sat at the top of the stadium -- read: the WORST seats,"" wrote Kim Levering. ""And I was surrounded by people who had bought their tickets through a Ticketmaster pre-sale. So lemme get this straight ... Ticketmaster rewards its customers and loyal fans by providing them with the worst seats in the house (even when selecting 'best available') during a pre-sale?"" ""I hoped Live Nation would provide competition for Ticketmaster and the outlandish surcharges and service fees,"" wrote avettbrosfan. ""Unfortunately, when I went to buy a '30 dollar' lawn ticket to see the Avett Brothers and Dave Matthews Band, the Live Nation surcharges bumped the ticket up to 52 dollars! So much for that hope."" Read more comments on the Marquee blog . Other people wrote of being forced to pay $100 surcharges, of being sent to other ticket sites (including Ticketmaster's own premium site, TicketsNow) and of all the other costs to go to a concert, such as parking, refreshments and merchandise. iReport: Your reaction to the possible merger . ""Here in L.A., the [Bruce Springsteen] TicketsNow tickets were available immediately when the tickets when on sale. Those seats were never available to the public to begin with. 'Reputable brokers' means 'really just us using a different name,' "" wrote Mauricio Heilbron Jr., M.D. Still, Ticketmaster had its defenders. The company's Web site is clean and simple, and it beats the old days of camping out at stores, wrote Steve. ""I remember all too well those days of standing in line for hours at Dillards to get to their Ticketmaster outlet, and still getting lousy tickets,"" he said. ""I'll be glad for the day when all tickets are available from one single outlet online."" Lost in all this is the impact on musicians, who seldom have a choice regarding ticket sellers at large venues. Pearl Jam had its protest in the '90s; Bruce Springsteen sounded off on the sales snafu for his 2009 tour. But in general, if you want to see -- or play -- a concert, there aren't many options. ""I could have gone on for hours about this. The fact is, I would love to change my purchasing plans, but how can I? If I want to see a show, what option do I have?"" said musician, and music fan, Brian Riback on iReport. iReport.com: Read more of Riback's comments . ""Sure, I can purchase off of Stubhub or Craigslist ... but I don't want to pay even more than I'm already being ripped off.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Suicide bombers killed 60 people near a holy Shiite shrine in Baghdad on Friday and a car bomber left seven people dead in Diyala, according to security and medical officials. A little girl whose parents are missing in the Baghdad bombings Friday rests in a hospital. Along with the 60 dead, many of whom were Iranian pilgrims, at least 125 others were wounded when two female suicide bombers struck on roads leading to the Imam Musa al-Kadhim shrine, one of the holiest in Shiite Islam, the Interior Ministry said. The Iranians who were killed and wounded were on a pilgrimage to holy sites in Iraq, an Interior Ministry official said. The bombers hit the Kadhimiya neighborhood of Baghdad, where the shrine is located, on the Muslim day of prayer. Iraqi State TV reported that Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has ordered an investigation. The top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. Raymond Odierno, told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Friday he believes Iraqis won't be ""intimidated by the attack"" and ""they will not let this stand in their way of moving forward.""

Later on Friday, a suicide car bomber detonated explosives in Diyala province, killing at least seven people and wounding 29 others. The bomber attacked a car dealership in Jawlawla, a town that has been the center of a territorial dispute between the central government and the Kurdistan Regional Government. Fridays attacks follow the deadliest day in Iraq this year, in which 87 people were killed in attacks, after months of plummeting violence. Many of the dead on Thursday were also Shiite pilgrims from Iran. Friday's bombings were the third attack on Kadhimiya this month. Reaction was swift in predominantly Shiite Iran. The media reported that Reza Moussavi, spokesman of Iran's Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization, announced a ban on Iranians crossing into Iraq via the Khosrawi border for pilgrimage until further notice. Javad Jahangirzadh, a member of Iran's parliament, was quoted as saying the aim of the attackers ""was to show that the Iraq government was not successful and not performing well. ""There must be a plot behind all of this aimed at damaging the growing relationship between Iran and Iraq."" Iranian President Mahmoud Ahamedinejad earlier issued condolences for the Iranian pilgrims killed on Thursday. ""The report on martyrdom and injury of a group of dear compatriots, who were on their way to holy sites [in Iraq], has caused deep sorrow,"" he said. ""The incident once again showed that the results and gift of occupation and terrorism for regional nations are insecurity and innocent people's bloodshed,"" he said. Odierno said ""this spike in suicide attacks that we've seen over the last couple of days, frankly, is another tragic event caused by al Qaeda and their links. They are killing many innocent people. They are killing pilgrims going to pray. They're killing women and children. They're killing homeless."" The violence erupted as the Obama administration plans to withdraw American troops from Iraq. The U.S.-Iraqi security agreement negotiated last year set a June 30 deadline for combat troops to be pulled out of urban areas. The Iraqi government could request that combat forces remain in some cities and the agreement could be amended. The agreement calls for the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of 2011. Odierno was asked what effect the violence will have on that deadline and whether the volatile city of Mosul -- where al Qaeda in Iraq has had a potent presence -- would be included in the combat withdrawals. ""The one area I'm still not sure about is Mosul,"" Odierno said.Most of the 87 people who died Thursday were killed in a bombing in Diyala province, in which 55 died, and an attack in Baghdad that killed 28. Many of the dead in the Diyala attack were also Shiite pilgrims from Iran. In the Baghdad attack, a female suicide bomber struck as national police were helping distribute Red Crescent aid to displaced families in the Karrada district.

"FARGO, North Dakota (CNN)  -- More than 1,000 volunteers rushed to fill sandbags early Wednesday as many in North Dakota tried to protect themselves from a historic floods that are expected to swamp the area. A Fargo resident surveys the sandbags outside his home, located about 15 feet from the Red River, on Tuesday. Even at 3:30 a.m., hundreds of volunteers packed into individual sandbagging centers, an organizer said. ""There have been so many volunteers that we had to turn people away,"" said Ryan McEwan, a supervisor at one volunteer coordinating center. ""It is very busy. They are filling sandbags as fast as they can."" Fargo city officials estimated that as many as 10,000 volunteers have come forward since Sunday to aid in a sandbagging effort that's taken over North Dakota State University's central arena, the Fargodome, and to help build levees along the now closely watched Red River. See map of affected area » . That river posed the greatest risk of about eight rivers in the state that were at flood levels, emergency officials said. The fear is that the Red River could overtake all previous records. As of Wednesday morning, the Red River ran at about 33 feet -- 15 feet above flood stage. A record level of 41.1 feet was set in 1897. The record level of the river set in the April 1897 flood could be surpassed Friday, Cecily Fong of the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services said Tuesday. More than 1,000 people were evacuated from an area near the city of Bismarck on Tuesday night as the Missouri River flooded, Rick Robinson of the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services said Wednesday. Recent rain and blizzard conditions have swollen the rivers. Gov. John Hoeven received word late Tuesday that North Dakota had received a presidential disaster declaration. ""We've had a severe winter and are experiencing significant flooding across the state, so we are grateful to receive this federal assistance as we continue the flood fight and recovery effort,"" Hoeven said. Under the declaration, the federal government will cover 75 percent of the costs. ""We're concerned about the rise of the river and how fast it's coming up, so our concern is that we're going to hit 41 feet,"" Fargo Deputy Mayor Tim Mahoney said Tuesday, adding that the way the levees are currently set up, they would protect against overflow only up to 38 feet. Officials are guessing the Red River, which runs through the eastern parts of North and South Dakota, and western Minnesota, could crest in Fargo -- North Dakota's largest city, with about 99,200 residents -- anytime Friday or Saturday and that the water may linger at its crest height. The city has canceled all trials scheduled in Fargo Municipal Court through April 2 because of the expected flooding, to allow all police officers to be available for possible emergencies, according to the city's Web site. As of late Tuesday, Fargo residents and out-of-town volunteers had filled more than 1 million sandbags out of the needed 2 million. Mahoney said he hoped that, with the 24-hour sandbagging effort at the Fargodome, that goal will be met by Thursday. iReport.com: Are you there? Share photos, video . Another factor threatening efforts is the possibility of freezing temperatures, because sandbags freeze together and then aren't individually stackable. Despite the stress, volunteers have been working around the clock. ""You got old people, young people -- all helping out,"" Mahoney said. ""It's heartwarming to see how many people are here."" CNN's Robyn Sidersky contributed to this story.","City of Fargo prepares for what could be the worst flooding it's ever had .

"ATHENS, Georgia (CNN)  -- A University of Georgia professor apparently shot and killed his wife and two other people at a community theater group's reunion Saturday, then dropped the couple's two children off at a neighbor's and fled. An alert on the UGA Web site says professor George Zinkhan  is a suspect in an off-campus shooting. Athens-Clarke County police said they have local, regional and national alerts out for George Zinkhan, 57, an endowed marketing professor at the school's Terry College of Business. ""It appeared he and his wife were having problems,"" police Capt. Clarence Holeman said. Holeman identified the dead as Marie Bruce, 47, Zinkhan's wife and a prominent Athens attorney; Tom Tanner, 40; and Ben Teague, 63. Friends identified Bruce as the president of the board of the Town and Gown Players, the theater group holding a reunion picnic on the theater's deck when the shooting took place. Tanner and Teague were identified as set designers for the theater. Two other people were wounded by ricocheting bullets, Holeman said, but did not identify them. At least 20 people were in attendance at the event, he said. Zinkhan was not at the theater event initially, Holeman said, but when he arrived, he got into ""a disagreement"" with his wife. He left the scene -- police believe to his car, where his children were waiting -- and returned with two handguns. ""It only took a few minutes,"" Holeman said. Police found eight shell casings, he said. After the shootings, Zinkhan left the scene with his two children -- ages 8 and 10 -- still in the vehicle, police said. He drove to a neighbor's home in nearby Bogart, Georgia, where he lived, and left the children there. The neighbor, Bob Covington, told CNN that Zinkhan arrived at his home shortly after noon with the two children. ""He rang the doorbell -- asked me if I could keep his kids for about an hour,"" Covington said. ""I said sure, and he said there'd been some type of emergency, and he took off."" Zinkhan seemed hurried and agitated but that seemed consistent with an emergency, Covington said. He didn't question Zinkhan about the emergency, Covington said, adding that it wasn't unusual for someone in his family to watch the children. An hour or so later, he said, police arrived and took the children. Covington described Zinkhan as ""a very quiet guy, but family-oriented."" ""He was great around his kids,"" he said. ""Never saw a bit of a problem between he his wife or his kids."" Covington said he was ""completely shocked, didn't believe it"" when he heard the news, and said he knew Marie Bruce much better than her husband. ""She was much more talkative, very vivacious,"" he said. Police Maj. Mike Shockley told CNN that officers were searching Zinkhan's home Saturday and that a wide search for the suspect was in progress. ""It's still a hunt,"" he said. "" ... Now it's just a matter of trying to locate him."" Holeman said Zinkhan has relatives in Texas and owns a home in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. He was last seen driving a red, 2005 Jeep Liberty, Holeman said. The news reverberated across Athens. ""The University community is shocked and saddened at this tragic event,"" University of Georgia President Michael F. Adams, said in a written statement. ""Our first thoughts are for safety of the university community and for prompt apprehension of the person responsible. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of all those who have been affected."" Another university professor, Steve Elliott-Gower, told CNN that Zinkhan had been at the school for at least 10 years and was ""a distinguished professor with a national reputation."" ""He was quirky and aloof, but absolutely nothing that I saw would lead me to this conclusion,"" said the professor. Elliott-Gower said he didn't know Zinkhan well, but knew him through Zinkhan's wife who, like Elliott-Gower, was associated with the theater. ""There are generations of people in the Athens community that have been involved in the theater,"" he said. ""It's really difficult to imagine how an organization which is this close-knit recovers from something like this."" Town and Gown Players' Web site said its present production, ""Sherlock Holmes: The Final Adventure,"" is canceled.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- FBI Director Robert Mueller pointed Monday to recent terror attacks in Mumbai, India, and Somalia to highlight the FBI's concern that small groups or individuals could carry out such attacks on U.S. soil. FBI Director Robert Mueller says he worries the Mumbai attack could be replicated in the United States. In a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations, Mueller worried that the dramatic terror attack on hotels and other facilities in Mumbai potentially could be replicated in the United States. ""This type of attack reminds us that terrorists with large agendas and little money can use rudimentary weapons to maximize their impact. And it again raises the question of whether a similar attack could happen in Seattle or San Diego, Miami, or Manhattan,"" Mueller said. He said he is increasingly concerned with ""pockets of people around the world that identify with al Qaeda and its ideology"" but who have little or no actual contact with al Qaeda. Mueller cited the first-ever suicide bombing by a naturalized U.S. citizen last October. A Somali native who had settled in Minnesota traveled back to Somalia and blew up himself and 29 others. The idea that Shirwa Ahmed, 27, was radicalized in the United States raised red flags throughout the FBI. ""One pattern in particular concerns us,"" Mueller said. ""The prospect of young men, indoctrinated and radicalized within their own communities and induced to travel to Somalia to take up arms -- and to kill themselves and perhaps many others -- is a perversion of the immigrant story. And it raises the question of whether these young men will one day come home and, if so, what they might undertake here."" Authorities have said as many as 20 young Somali men reported missing in Minnesota may have returned to Somalia to take up arms.","FBI director: Mumbai attack showed terrorists with little money can have large impact .

"(CNN)  -- Skier Paul Wampach, a 49-year-old manager from Chicago, Illinois, hardly matches the stereotype of a hostel dweller: an under-30 backpacker from outside the United States who can't afford fancy lodging. Travelers looking to meet new people might consider staying at hostels, say experts. For the fifth time in two years, Wampach plans to head to the Fireside Inn in Breckenridge, Colorado, where he's booked a dorm-style room for less than $40 a night during his ski vacation. ""If I'm traveling by myself, there's no reason to splurge,"" said Wampach, who is single and described himself as neither rich nor poor. ""That $40 or $50 [I save on lodging] goes to food, beer and ski-lift tickets."" And amenities such as Internet access and a hot tub at the hostel add creature comforts to the trip. Wampach's travel habits are consistent with a growing number of travelers called ""flashpackers."" They are usually over 30, in mid-to-late career and can afford higher-end hotels but instead choose budget options -- albeit better-furnished and well-kept ones -- because it fits their lifestyle, said Mark Vidalin, Marketing Director for Hostelling International USA, a nonprofit network of hostels. Flashpackers also tend to stay connected by traveling with gadgets and seeking accommodations with free Wi-Fi, Vidalin said. The term ""flashpacker"" likely originated in Australia, and combines the term ""flash"" -- meaning ""stylish"" -- with ""backpacker,"" according to Vidalin. Flashpackers and regular backpackers are booking hostels at U.S. vacation destinations in full force this year. Attendance at hostels has been consistently rebounding from lows following the September 11, 2001. This year's turbulent economy appears to be fueling demand for hostel space. Heading into ski season, Loree Weisman, the owner of the Crested Butte International Lodge and Hostel in Crested Butte, Colorado, said her hostel bookings are trending ahead of the town's other lodging options -- and up about 25 percent from her bookings by the same time last year. Amid the unsteady economy, she said, people ""don't want to give up a vacation, but they might need to adapt a vacation."" Instead of canceling pricey vacations due to economic fears, many travelers are rejecting accommodations with private bedrooms and bathrooms. They're going for hostels with their dorm-style bunk beds, community bathrooms, and, most importantly for many hostel dwellers, shared living spaces. ""There's a sense of community, and there's a social aspect to it that's pretty significant,"" said Jim Williams, editor of ""The Hostel Handbook"" and a former hostel owner. ""That is the heart of hostelling. You don't go to a hotel and lock the door."" Wampach agreed, saying that hostels offer ""a tremendous way to meet people from different cultures and talk to people you wouldn't normally talk to."" But the communal atmosphere of hostels leaves many travelers skeptical, particularly Americans, Williams said. ""Americans have privacy issues. If you suggested to most people they were going to share a room with five other people, most of them wouldn't want to do it,"" he said. What if a roommate snores or what if he smells or doesn't stop talking? -- these are legitimate questions for travelers considering the hostel option, said Williams. Frequent hostel dweller Mandy Creighton, 30, said she enjoys the overall hostel experience, but it's a ""huge challenge"" to ""walk through the room and to my room without having to talk to 20 people."" Creighton and her partner, Ryan Mlynarczyk, 32, who are documentary filmmakers from Sebastopol, California, are bicycling around the United States for a year and stopping in ecologically sustainable communities along the way. Their choice to stay in hostels is rooted in a desire to maintain a green lifestyle by sharing resources as well as saving money. Mlynarczyk experienced the other side of the privacy issue when he stepped out of a shower in a San Francisco, California, hostel to discover he had a female audience. ""I ... didn't have my towel on -- and some girl walks in and was like, 'Woo!' I'm totally open to that sort of thing, but I think she was a little bit new to it, and she kind of was giggling. But obviously the immediate reaction was, 'Oh my God!' "" Mlynarczyk said. In contrast to Americans who treasure their personal space, the communal environment is more ingrained in European culture, experts said. It's possible to trace that cultural divide to post-World War II, said Williams, when Europe underwent its financial recovery in the 1950s and its culture was more communal. On the other hand, the U.S. economy was booming, and there was no need for Americans to share resources. ""At the same time [Europeans] were creating hostels, American teenagers were focused on getting their own cars,"" Williams said. Nevertheless, Hostelling International reported its hostels in many destination cities saw notable increases in October versus the same time last year: New York overnight guests increased by 9.8 percent, Washington by 9.7 percent and San Diego, California, by 22.1 percent, according to Hostelling International. Despite the rise in many hostel bookings, Williams said hostelling still isn't part of mainstream American culture. ""We do hostelling about as well as we do soccer. We do it, but it's a limited market, and we do it a certain way. Otherwise, most Americans aren't very comfortable [with] it,"" Williams said. Wampach said he believes this represents Americans' ""relatively conservative views and lifestyles."" But people are respectful of each other's space, he said, and they rarely spend time together in the dorm room aside from sleeping anyway. ""You just do your best; everybody understands you are who are,"" Wampach said. ""Sometimes you get a guy who snores but ... that's part of the deal.""","""Flashpackers"" are professionals older than 30 who prefer hostels to hotels .

"(CNN) -- When 3-year-old Rowan Isaacson darted away from his father and dived into a herd of grazing horses, it easily could have been the end of the small autistic boy. He was babbling under the hooves of a boss mare. Rupert Isaacson says he noticed immediate improvement in his son's language skills when he started riding. ""I thought he was going to get trampled,"" recalled Rupert Isaacson, Rowan's father. But the horse, Betsy, dipped her head and chewed with her mouth in submission. Isaacson, who had trained horses for a living, had never seen it happen so spontaneously. Rowan had seemingly made a connection. The Austin, Texas, family had been struggling with Rowan. His wild tantrums were nearly driving Isaacson and his wife, Kristin Neff, to divorce. All the while, little Rowan was becoming unreachable. ""He would just stare off into space,"" Isaacson said. ""I was worried it was going to get progressively worse and that eventually, he might float away from us entirely. Luckily, right about that time is when he met Betsy."" Isaacson began riding Betsy, a neighbor's horse, with Rowan. He says he noticed immediate improvement in his son's language skills.  Watch Rowan and Betsy » . ""He would start to answer. He would start to talk. We would do song games up there on the saddle. I would take books up there in the saddle,"" Isaacson said. Autism specialists say that horse riding can be effective in gaining access to autistic children. Experts make a distinction between the kind of recreational therapeutic riding Isaacson was using with Rowan and hippotherapy, which is a medical treatment that uses horses and is supervised by a licensed speech-language pathologist. ""People perceive it's the interaction with the horse that's making the change. However, the movement of the horse is extremely powerful, and it's that movement that's having neurological impact on the autistic child,"" said Ruth Dismuke-Blakely, a speech-language pathologist and hippotherapy clinical specialist in Edgewood, New Mexico. According to preliminary analysis of an ongoing study by Dismuke-Blakely, hippotherapy has been shown to increase verbal communication skills in some autistic children in as little as 18 to 25 minutes of riding once a week for eight weeks. ""We see their arousal and affect change. They become more responsive to cues. If they are at a point where they are using verbal cues, you get more words,"" Dismuke-Blakely said. ""It's almost like it opens them up. It gives us access."" She cautions that a horse's movements can be powerful. For some autistic children, riding too long can overstimulate their nervous system, leading to more erratic behavior. On Betsy, Rowan was at ease. After about three weeks, Isaacson says, Rowan's improved behavior was translating into the home and outside world as well. But not consistently. In late 2004, Isaacson, a human rights activist, brought a delegation of African bushmen from Botswana to the United Nations. Among the men were traditional healers, who offered to work with Rowan. Isaacson says he was skeptical, but he had experience with the bushmen and allowed the healers to lay their hands on his son. ""I was kind of flabbergasted at Rowan's response. For about four days while they were with him, he started to lose some of his symptoms. He started to point, which was a milestone he hadn't achieved,"" Isaacson said. When the tribal healers left, Rowan regressed. Isaacson says he couldn't help but wonder what would happen if he were to give Rowan a longer exposure to the two things that he seemed to have responded well to: horses and shamans. ""I know it sounds completely crazy,"" he said. ""I just had a gut feeling."" Isaacson took his wife and son to Mongolia. ""It's the oldest horse culture on the planet. Everyone still gets around on a horse there -- so a nomadic culture. The word 'shaman' comes from there,"" Isaacson said, explaining his decision. ""I just thought, 'Well, what if we went there and rode across the steppe and visited traditional healers? You know, what might happen for Rowan? Might there be some positive outcomes?' "" Trekking across the Mongolian prairie on horseback, Isaacson says, Rowan's behavior was changed dramatically. ""Rowan was not cured of autism out there,"" Isaacson stressed. ""The word 'cure' is not in my vocabulary for this. Rowan came back without three key dysfunctions that he had. He went out to Mongolia incontinent and still suffering from these neurological firestorms -- so tantruming all the time and cut off from his peers, unable to make friends -- and he came back with those three dysfunctions having gone."" Isaacson credits Rowan's improvement to horses and time in nature -- and to shamanic healing, which he says he simply can't explain rationally. Isaacson has written a book, ""The Horse Boy,"" about Rowan's autism. Rowan, now 7, rides Betsy by himself. His parents never abandoned more orthodox treatments for his autism, and Rowan's applied behavioral analysis therapist has him studying math and English at the third-grade level -- a full year ahead of some of his peers. ""He's just becoming a very functional autistic person,"" Isaacson said. As far as the Isaacson family's journey took them, it is the same hard slog facing millions of families gripped by autism. ""A lot of the parents go to the ends of the Earth in their own living rooms every day,"" Isaacson said. ""I mean, we had more stressful car rides to the grocery store than any of the stresses and challenges of the trip to Mongolia."" You don't have to get on a horse -- or plane to Siberia -- for relief. For autism families, Isaacson encourages parents to simply follow their instincts and listen to what their child shows them. ""In our case, it was horses in Mongolia and these shamans,"" Isaacson said. ""It could just as easily have been bicycles and, you know, steam trains. And if it had been, we'd have done a steam train journey. We'd have done whatever Rowan seemed to be showing us he wanted to do, because that was where he was intrinsically motivated.""","Family travels across Mongolia so autistic son can ride horses, meet shaman .

"(CNN) -- A female graduate student at Virginia Tech was killed Wednesday night when a man she knew attacked her with a knife and decapitated her, a school spokesman said. Virginia Tech police Chief Wendell Flinchum talks about the first slaying on campus since the 2007 shootings. Virginia Tech spokesman Mark Owczarski said Thursday that Xin Yang's killing was the first on the campus since April 16, 2007, when a shooter killed 32 people before turning a gun on himself. Yang, 22, from Beijing, China, was killed at the Au Bon Pain restaurant in the Graduate Life Center at around 7 p.m., school spokesman Larry Hincker said in a written statement. Campus police took Haiyang Zhu, 25, into custody at the scene. The Ningbo, China, native has been charged with first-degree murder and is being held without bail at a local jail, Hincker said. Zhu did not say anything to the arresting officers, said campus police Chief Wendell Flinchum. ""There was blood on him,"" Flinchum said.  The young woman and the suspect ""were not seen arguing, or anything of that nature,"" he added, citing witness statements. Authorities said the two students knew each other. ""Based on emergency contact records maintained by the university, it is known that Zhu and Yang knew each other,"" Hincker said. No other details were provided. The young woman arrived at the university two weeks ago to begin studies in accounting, he said in the statement. Zhu is a graduate student pursuing a doctorate in agricultural and applied economics. He began studies at Virginia Tech in fall 2008, Hincker said. ""Our hearts go out to the victim and her family,"" President Charles W. Steger said in a letter to the campus community. ""An act of violence like this one brings back memories of the April 16 tragedy and I have no doubt that many of us feel especially distraught.""

"(CNN)  -- The mother of a woman who gave birth on Monday to octuplets said her daughter already has six children at home and was undergoing fertility treatment. Dr. Karen Maples is part of the large team of doctors and nurses that helped deliver the octuplets. The Los Angeles Times reported on Thursday that Angela Suleman said her daughter had the embryos implanted last year, resulting in the eight births. ""They all happened to take,"" Suleman told the Times. ""I looked at those babies. They are so tiny and so beautiful."" The woman declined to have the number of embryos reduced when she discovered she was carrying multiples, the Times reported. The six older siblings range from ages 7 to 2, according to the newspaper. Suleman said she was concerned about her daughter's homecoming because her husband, a contract worker, is due to return to Iraq. In the meantime, the mother, who remains unidentified, appealed for privacy while she recovers from giving birth, medical officials said Thursday. In her written statement delivered by Dr. Karen Maples of the Kaiser Permanente Bellflower Medical Center in California, the woman who delivered eight babies in five minutes said she would soon make public the details of her ""miraculous experience."" ""We understand that you are all curious about the arrival of the octuplets, and we appreciate your respect for our family's privacy,"" she said. ""The babies continue to grow strong every day and make good progress. My family and I are ecstatic about all of their arrivals."" ""Needless to say, the eighth was a surprise to us all, but a blessing as well,"" she added. The six boys and two girls -- ranging in weight from 1 pound, 8 ounces to 3 pounds, 4 ounces -- are doing well following their Caesarean-section delivery at the Bellflower hospital, doctors said. They were born nine weeks premature. Dr. Mandhir Gupta, a neonatalist, said all but one of the octuplets are now breathing on their own. That baby might be taken off breathing equipment Friday. Caring for eight premature babies is a challenge. Duties are being shared by a large team of hospital nurses and doctors for the time being. Two nurses have been assigned to each child, and all the babies are receiving fluids, proteins and vitamins intravenously, Gupta said. ""We feed them. ... We change diapers. ... When they cry, we console them,"" Gupta said. ""When the mom comes and touches the babies, you can definitely see their expression on their faces and body. They are very happy."" The babies, who are being referred to by letters of the alphabet, will remain in the hospital for at least seven more weeks. Baby H made headlines for its surprise appearance during the delivery, which took months of preparation by a team of doctors, nurses and respiratory therapists.  Watch a report on babies' progress » . The mother will not be able to hold her babies for another week, Gupta said. They are still fragile, developing intestines, he said. Doctors initially thought the mother was pregnant with seven fetuses. She was hospitalized seven weeks ago and ordered to bed rest. During the seven weeks, a team of 46 physicians, nurses and other staff members prepared for the births. When they started the delivery Monday, they were in for a surprise. ""After the seventh baby was born, we were taking a sigh of relief,"" Maples said. ""It was a surprise of our life when we in fact discovered there was an eighth baby,"" she said. ""We never had an assignment for baby H nurse or baby H doctor. We just had to go on the fly and figure out what to do."" ""Baby G nurse stepped up. We handed off the baby to baby G nurse. She then delivered that last baby to the neonatologist of the baby F.""

"(CNN)  -- Tough economic times are taking a toll across the spectrum of business and individual activity -- and the country's institutions of higher learning are no exception. Andy Warhol is one of the artists in Brandeis University's acclaimed Rose Art Museum. Brandeis University, in Waltham, Massachusetts, will be taking an extraordinary step to preserve its educational mission -- the school's board of trustees voted Monday to close its acclaimed Rose Art Museum. The university will sell every one of the approximately 6,000 items in the museum, opened in 1961. ""These are extraordinary times, we cannot control or fix the nation's economic problems,"" university president Jehuda Reinharz said. ""We can only do what we have been entrusted to do -- act responsibly with the best interests of our students and their futures foremost in mind."" University spokesman Dennis Nealon said that the move to sell off the museum's exhibits was ""a very hard and painful decision"" but a necessary one for the school's survival. He said the decision, which calls for the museum to close in the summer, will not affect the university's ""commitment to the arts and the teaching of the arts."" The facility will become a fine arts teaching center with an exhibition gallery and studio space, he said. The museum's collection includes iconic paintings by such luminaries of American art as Andy Warhol, James Rosenquist, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Alex Katz and Roy Lichtenstein. Nealon said most of the museum's acquisitions are paintings and sculptures. The school has not undertaken a recent appraisal of the works, Nealon said, adding that the process may take as much as two years to complete. Brandeis, founded in 1948, is the only non-sectarian, Jewish-sponsored university in the country.","Brandeis trustees vote to close Rose Art Museum, sell collection .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- Over the last decade, Steven Soderbergh has taken the ""one for them, one for me"" concept of film-director politics to an almost comically programmatic extreme.

Basically, he makes big-budget crowd-pleasers like the ""Ocean's"" films, stuffed with movie stars and candied gimcrack fun, and between them he makes whatever oddball labor-of-love doodle (the enticing ""Bubble,"" the dreadful ""Solaris"") enters his head. What's disorienting about ""Che,"" his two-part, four-hour-and-17-minute, studiously eccentric drama about the revolutionary life and times of Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, is that it's almost a knowing brainteaser on Soderbergh's part to force you to figure out which category the film belongs to. Che cost a reported $65 million to make, it's full of exacting panoramas of strategy and combat set in the mountainous jungles of Cuba and Bolivia, and its hero is a figure who -- 41 years after his violent death -- remains so loved, hated, and mythologized that he fits into an epic drama timed for awards season as perfectly as Gandhi or Ray Charles ever did. Following a one-week Oscar-qualifying run, ""Che"" is now rolling out to major American cities, where it is likely to draw generations of filmgoers who've either worn Che on their T-shirts or have the honest curiosity to wonder: Who was this man before he became a Warhol-worthy icon of radical chic? In ""Che,"" Soderbergh stokes that curiosity, feeds it, and frustrates it, all at the same time. He's made a film that embraces the romance of revolution only to shake it off, leaving very little in its place. The first half of ""Che"" is a genuine achievement. It picks up Guevara (Benicio Del Toro) in 1955, when he was a clean-cut Argentine physician who dreamed of uniting Latin America through armed struggle. At a dinner party in Mexico City, he meets Fidel Castro -- played, with perfect domineering gesticulations, by Demian Bichir -- and the movie follows these two into the Cuban countryside, where they assemble the nuts and bolts of a revolution. Soderbergh exhibits a tinkerer's fascination with how it all worked, embedding each scene with a docu-nugget of information. We see Che taming his asthmatic coughing fits or reading books between battles, and learn how a battalion of rebels could defeat a platoon three times its size (with surprise, daring, and Molotov cocktails). Che is by turns scholar, guidance counselor, drill sergeant, and comandante, and Del Toro makes him a warrior-saint who learns, against his will, to cultivate a gruff bruiser facade. He yearns to be a ""true revolutionary, the highest level of humanity,"" and it's no insult to the film to say that Soderbergh and Del Toro succeed in portraying Che as a kind of T-shirt in three dimensions, a Guerrilla for All Seasons. But that's when things get strange, if not monumentally perverse. At the end of Part I -- the victory of the Cuban rebels -- my appetite was whetted to learn even more about Che, in particular how his humane ideals were tested, and compromised, by the Castro regime as it edged toward dictatorship. Instead, Part II leaps forward to 1966-67, when Che led the revolutionary war in Bolivia, and here's the thing: It turns out to be the same damn movie. Only in this dispirited rerun, the revolution doesn't take. The rebels, all squabbling ego, can barely summon the will to sacrifice and die, and the peasants have little belief that this ragtag crew is bringing a better world. Even with the U.S. poking its nose into the region, the Soviet Union won't back an insurrection. Soderbergh has built ""Che"" conceptually, as two giant panels of war, and his message is about the doomed destiny of Marxism. Che, like Marx, believed that the rise of the proletariat was inevitable -- the unstoppable tide of history -- but as the movie reveals, he was wrong. Che didn't ride a wave of history; instead, it crashed down on him. By remaining the same, he becomes, in Part II, a distant and deluded figure whose dream evaporates around him. As political theater, ""Che"" moves from faith to impotence, which is certainly a valid reading of Communism in the 20th century. Yet as drama, that makes the second half of the film borderline deadly. Che doesn't grow richer, deeper, or reveal any contradictions; he just gets more abstract -- a symbol of idealism too pure for this world. Che is twice as long as it needs to be, but it is also only half the movie it should have been. EW Grades: Part I: B+, Part II: C . CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly .

"(The Frisky) -- I've never really been a fan of the ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus"" school of relationship thought, but I'll admit that sometimes I feel as though the men I've dated have spoken a different language. Like when a great date is followed by the deafening silence of the phone. Or when the big relationship talk results in a boyfriend-shaped hole in my wall. Those are the times I want nothing more than a dictionary that translates every deer-in-headlights look, ambiguous voicemail, and cryptic text message. That's where Jeff Mac's ""Manslations: Decoding the Secret Language of Men"" comes in. The good . Actions speak louder than words. Sure, not a novel idea, but this ""duh"" lesson is one that can take years to learn. If it looks, walks, and quacks like a duck, then it's a duck. Mac's Golden Rule? Whenever there is any conflict between what a man says and what he does, always, always ignore what he says. There is no such thing as a man dumping you because he is afraid of getting hurt, is frightened that his feelings are too strong, or because he finds you intimidating. Mac says to think of the simplest solution -- is it that this man sensed you were the perfect woman for him, who touched him so much in deep, important places that he couldn't handle? Or was he just not feeling it? It's OK to call him first -- and if you get blown off, it's not because you called first. This is my favorite piece of advice from Mac, who says the mistaken conclusion women come to when they call first post-date and get blown off is that the call made them look clingy and spooked the guy. ""This is not how it went,"" says Mac. ""If you called him and he blew you off, it went like this: . 1. You had a great date, and he did not. 2. He planned to blow you off. 3. You called him, and nothing changed."" The bad . All men are obsessed with cars, the remote, sports, and video games. Yawn. For the record, my man keeps his video game playtime short, hands remote control power over to me, and doesn't care for sports or cars. Is my guy an exception to the rule, or is it possible that all men are different and do not necessarily share those interests as a gender? I'm guessing it's the latter. The ugly . Men are like dogs. Is this statement required filler for all dating books, right after the part about women being shopping-obsessed nags? According to Mac, men are like dogs because, among other things, they have short attention spans and pay a lot of attention to their own crotches and the crotches of others. I'm willing to bet short attention span isn't an inherently male trait, and I can personally testify that neither is an interest in crotches. So is Jeff Mac's ""Manslations"" the be-all and end-all of man manuals? Not exactly. But when your girlfriends refuse to help you decode, for the eighth time, what he meant when he said, ""I'll call you later,"" Jeff Mac's sometimes trite, always funny advice comes in handy.

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan has arrested a suspected al Qaeda militant who intelligence officials say is tied to the London subway bombings in 2005, authorities there said Thursday. The double-decker bus damaged by a bomb in central London on July 7, 2005. Zabih al-Taifi was arrested in a village near Peshawar on Wednesday as part of ongoing security operations in the area, police and intelligence officials told CNN. Six others, both Afghans and Pakistanis, were also arrested. The Metropolitan Police Service in London, also known as Scotland Yard, issued a statement refusing to comment on the arrest. ""Speculation around this reported arrest with alleged links to an ongoing terrorist trial is unhelpful and may be prejudicial to current criminal proceedings,"" it said. The London blasts killed 52 people and wounded at least 900 others when bombs went off on three subway trains and a bus on July 7, 2005. Security analysts say the village where al-Taifi was arrested in the North West Frontier Province has been the site of recent clashes between Pakistani security forces and militants. CNN's Zein Basravi contributed to this report.","Officials say arrested al Qaeda militant has ties to 2005 London subway bombings .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN)  -- A Russian-led bloc of post-Soviet nations has agreed to establish a rapid-reaction military force to combat terrorists and respond to regional emergencies, Russian media reported Wednesday. Russian navy soldiers stand guard during a military ceremony. The decision came a day after reports that Kyrgyzstan is planning to close a strategically important U.S. military base that Washington uses to transport troops and supplies into Afghanistan. On Wednesday, the Collective Security Treaty Organization -- made up of Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan -- decided on the rapid-reaction force at a Kremlin summit, the Russian news agency RIA-Novosti reported. The group's security council ""spent a long time discussing the central issue of forming collective reaction forces and, generally, of rapid reaction to possible threats,"" said Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, according to Russian news agency Interfax. ""Everyone agreed that the formation of joint forces is necessary,"" he said. Officials told Russian media that all the members had signed the agreement, though Uzbekistan submitted a special provision. Uzbekistan doesn't mind contributing military units to the rapid-reaction force ""but does not consider it necessary for the moment"" to attach emergency responders, drug-control forces and other special services, organization spokesman Vitaly Strugovets told Interfax. Russian media reported that the force will be used to fight military aggressors, conduct anti-terror operations, battle regional drug trafficking and respond to natural disasters. The force will be based in Russia under a single command, with member nations contributing military units. On Tuesday, Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev announced at a Moscow news conference that ""all due procedures"" were being initiated to close Manas Air Base, RIA-Novosti reported. The announcement was made after news reports of a multimillion-dollar aid package from Russia to Kyrgyzstan. Gen. David Petraeus, who oversees U.S. operations in the Middle East and Central Asia, including Afghanistan, was in Kyrgyzstan last month, partly to lobby the government to allow the United States to keep using the base. He said he and Kyrgyz leaders did not discuss ""at all"" the possible closure of the base and said local officials told him there was ""no foundation"" for news reports about the issue. The United States is planning to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan to halt a resurgence of the Taliban. Petraeus described Manas as having ""an important role in the deployment of these forces"" and in refueling aircraft. The relationship between the United States and Kyrgyzstan was damaged when a Kyrgyz citizen was killed by a U.S. airman in December 2006. The airman was transferred out of Kyrgyzstan, and the dead man's family was offered compensation. Petraeus said in January that the investigation was being reopened. As he announced the base closure Tuesday, Bakiyev said he was not satisfied with the inquiry into the accident and his government's ""inability to provide security to its citizens"" was proving a serious concern.  Medvedev also weighed in on the issue Wednesday, saying the base closure shouldn't hamper anti-terrorism operations, according to Interfax. ""It would be great if their numbers meant there were fewer terrorists, but such action depends on other things as well,"" he said.","Seven nations agree to form rapid-reaction force .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's Serious Fraud Office and London police are investigating an alleged $81 million (£56 million) fraud on the corporate banking department of Allied Irish Banks (AIB). Allied Irish Banks has allegedly been the subject of a $81 million fraud. The SFO said it had searched a business and two residential addresses in London and believed AIB was not the only financial institution deceived by the suspects. It said that between 2003 and 2007 AIB, Ireland's largest bank by market value, loaned money for the purchase of UK investment properties to companies controlled by an individual who was now the main suspect. The SFO said the main suspect operated with the assistance of others. However, in 2008 AIB identified problems with one element of its security interests over the investment properties. ""Following an internal review it became apparent that the guarantees of certain lease payments on these properties by an investment grade counterparty (a blue chip property company) were fraudulent,"" the SFO said. AIB referred the matter to the authorities and also took control of and sold the relevant properties, which resulted in a write down of the outstanding loan balances by £56m, the SFO said. The office said the alleged fraud involved the borrowing companies creating ""overriding"" leases. ""These leases were generally for longer periods and at higher rents than the existing occupational tenants' leases. ""The apparent existence of these additional leases increased the values of the properties, with lease payments being a direct obligation of the investment grade counterparty,"" the SFO said. AIB is considering legal action over the $81 million loss.","British authorities probing alleged $81 million fraud involving Irish bank .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The Indian owners of car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) have agreed to pump ""tens of millions"" of dollars into the luxury car brand to prevent a cash flow crisis, it was reported Monday. Jaguar Land Rover was bought by the Indian company Tata earlier this year for $2.3 billion. The moves comes as the British government ponders a public-funded bailout of the West Midlands-based automaker, the Financial Times newspaper said. Tata, which bought JLR earlier this year, warned its support for the UK subsidiary did not negate the argument that the British government should provide bridging loans and credit guarantees to help the company and the car sector as a whole through the current financial difficulties, the FT said. Last week, the ailing ""big three"" automakers in the U.S. were given a boost when the Bush administration agreed a $13.4 billion loan package. Now British Business Secretary Lord Mandelson has come under pressure to come up with a similar package for UK manufacturers. JLR employs 15,000 workers in Britain and is seen as a vital contributor to the West Midlands regional economy in particular. However, the business secretary at the weekend reiterated that the state had to be a ""lender of last resort,"" only after Tata has looked to its own resources, the FT reported. Any state support would be conditional on the due diligence on the Indian parent company being conducted by the government's City advisers, according to officials. A spokesman for Lord Mandelson's Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform told the British Press Association: ""The Government doesn't have an open cheque-book to bail out ailing companies, but we are doing all we can to help businesses overcome the current challenges. ""Jaguar Land Rover have owners who are well resourced and have the first responsibility to sustain the companies they own."" According to the FT, accountancy firm KPMG and investment bank NM Rothschild have been called in to advise the UK government on the Indian group's complex finances and to assess demands from the car sector.","Tata bought the British-based luxury car maker earlier this year .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Conflict raged Wednesday in volatile northwestern Pakistan, with nine militants killed in a gun battle, the Taliban's abduction and release of about 30 police officers, and strikes on stranded NATO trucks. Pakistani policemen at a check point in Khyber Agency near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, February 12, 2008. It's the latest fighting between Pakistani security forces and the Taliban militants in the northwestern region near Afghanistan. The country's central government has little control in the area, and U.S. intelligence officials say the area is a haven for militants. Nine militants were killed when police and local residents foiled an attempted kidnapping of the mayor in a village on the outskirts of Peshawar, police told CNN. Taliban fighters attempted to abduct Fahim Ur Rehman, but police and residents resisted and a gun battle ensued. Along with the slain militants, two police and two civilians were wounded and some of the militants fled. The village, Bazid Khel, is located between Peshawar and the Khyber Agency in the tribal areas. In the Swat Valley, militants abducted around 30 police Tuesday night but eventually released them on Wednesday. Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan confirmed to CNN that the personnel had been released after returning to the path of Islam and promising not to return to their jobs. Police told CNN that the security personnel had been forced to agree to the Taliban's terms and confirmed the release. There are conflicting details about the incident, in which Taliban forces attacked the Shamozai check post in the Barikot area of Swat Valley on Tuesday night and captured the people after a nightlong firefight. Khan said the personnel surrendered after Taliban forces mined the area, preventing access. He said their ammunition was seized when supply vehicles coming to assist government forces were stopped by Taliban mines. Pakistan police said the security personnel didn't surrender; they were caught after they used up their ammunition. Police and military sources said the personnel were police, but Khan said paramilitary officers as well as police were among the group. Locals said government forces came under attack Tuesday evening and ran out of ammunition before surrendering. This comes as the Pakistani military beefed up its operations this week in the Swat Valley. In the latest in a series of recent attacks meant to choke off supplies into Afghanistan for the United States and its allies, a rocket strike destroyed at least nine vehicles near the town Landi Kotal in the Khyber Agency -- one of seven semiautonomous tribal agencies along the Afghan border, a Khyber official told CNN. The trucks were returning from Afghanistan but were stranded in the town because, a day earlier, suspected militants had destroyed a bridge connecting Landi Kotal to Jamrod, another part of the Khyber Agency. The bridge's destruction had forced authorities to halt traffic. Because Afghanistan is landlocked, many of the supplies for NATO-led troops fighting Islamic militants there have to be trucked from Pakistan. In recent months, militants aligned with the Taliban and al Qaeda have carried out several attacks to disrupt supplies, Pakistani officials said.","NEW: Nine militants die as police, residents foil attempted kidnapping of mayor .

"(CNN) -- A major humanitarian crisis is unfolding in northern Sri Lanka with 250,000 unprotected civilians trapped in the crossfire between government troops and rebel forces, the Red Cross says. A civilian, injured during fighting in rebel territory, lies on a bed at a hospital in Vavuniya on January 16, 2009. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has appealed to both sides to facilitate the movement of civilians out of the combat zone which has seen intensified fighting. ""People are being caught in the crossfire, hospitals and ambulances have been hit by shelling and several aid workers have been injured while evacuating the wounded,"" Jacques de Maio, ICRC head of operations for South Asia in Geneva said in a statement on the ICRC Web site."" The violence is preventing the ICRC from operating in the region. In the capital, Colombo, Indian foreign affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee huddled Wednesday with Sri Lankan President Mahindra Rajapaksa on the potential humanitarian crisis. ""The Sri Lankan government has reassured that they would respect the safe zones and minimize the effects of conflict on Tamil civilians,"" Mukherjee said. His discussions with Rajapaksa also envisioned a post-civil war Sri Lanka. ""We will work together with the government of Sri Lanka to enable all Sri Lankans, and particularly the Tamil community who have borne the brunt of the effects of the conflict, to lead normal lives as soon as possible,"" Mukherjee said. But for now, the ICRC says hundreds of patients are in need of emergency treatment and evacuation to Vavuniya Hospital in the government-controlled area and has urged that humanitarian assistance be unhampered in the Vanni region. ""When the dust settles, we may see countless victims and a terrible humanitarian situation, unless civilians are protected and international humanitarian law is respected in all circumstances,"" Maio said. ""It's high time to take decisive action and stop further bloodshed because time is running out."" Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has also called for the safety of civilians as humanitarian groups try to provide aid to people trapped in the region. ""The secretary-general is deeply concerned about the safety and well-being of civilians caught in intensified fighting in the Vanni region of Sri Lanka,"" a spokesman for Ban said in a statement Monday. Ban called on the government and the separatist Tamil Tigers to respect ""no-fire zones"" and civilians areas, including schools, hospitals and humanitarian posts. He also asked both sides to allow civilians trapped in the fighting to move to ""safe areas."" Sri Lankan soldiers seized a key rebel stronghold in a surprise attack Sunday, even as humanitarian agencies feared for the safety of civilians.  Watch a report on the recent fighting » . ""It's an incredibly serious situation,"" James Elder, a U.N. spokesman, said Monday. ""We have a very large number of people, including tens of thousands of children, trapped in a fast-shrinking conflict zone."" Troops crossed a lagoon and entered the town of Mullaittivu before encountering heavy resistance from Tamil fighters, according to the government-run news agency. ""Our troops fought their way through a 40 km (25 mile) thick jungle track,"" Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka said in a televised address Sunday. ""This is the long-awaited victory and I am happy to say that our heroic forces today captured the Mullaittivu town after 12 years,"" the Sri Lanka Army chief said. There has been no confirmation from the rebels that the strategic garrison has been overtaken. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- commonly known as the Tamil Tigers -- have fought for an independent homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority since 1983. The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead. The rebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996 and established a military garrison there, according to the government. In recent days, the military has said it has made significant progress in its campaign to recapture rebel strongholds. Earlier this month, troops regained control of the northern town of Elephant Pass, the point at which mainland Sri Lanka links to the northern Jaffna peninsula. It had been in rebel hands for more than nine years. The recapture enabled the government to use a highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies. Previously, it was done by air and sea. ""The area that the LTTE has dominated has shrank phenomenally,"" Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India, C.R Jayasinghe, told CNN.

"(CNN) -- Slavery may seem like a quaint notion in a 21st century world, but that distinction is lost on up to 40,000 Brazilians who find themselves toiling for no real wages and can't leave the distant work camps where they live. A Brazilian government official takes notes as he talks with workers about to be freed. Brazilian government officials and human rights activists call it slave labor, a condition they are aggressively trying to eradicate. A special government task force established in 1995 says it freed 4,634 workers last year in 133 raids on large farms and businesses that rely on workers driven to take these jobs by hunger and the empty promises of labor recruiters. ""Slavery is the tail end of a lot of abuse of poor people and workers in Brazil,"" said Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based policy center. ""Bad treatment reaches over to abusive treatment to treatment that becomes virtual slavery."" In Brazil, it often works this way: A recruiter known as a ""gato,"" or cat, plumbs the slums and other poor areas of the vast country and gets people to agree to jobs in distant places. Once separated from home and family, workers are vulnerable to all sorts of abuses, such as being told they owe money for transportation, food, housing and other services. ""This is known as debt bondage, which also fits official definitions of slavery,"" says Anti-slavery International, a lobbying group based in Great Britain. ""A person is in debt bondage when their labor is demanded as the means of repayment for a loan or an advance. Once in debt they lose all control over their conditions of work and what, if anything they are paid ... often making it impossible to repay and trapping them in a cycle of debt."" The United Nations International Labour Organization estimated there were between 25,000 and 40,000 Brazilians working under such conditions in 2003, the latest year for which it offered figures. Leonardo Sakamoto, the director of the human rights group Reporter Brasil, says he's certain there are still more than 25,000 slave laborers in Brazil. According to Anti-slavery International, the greatest number of slave laborers is employed in ranching (43 percent). That's followed by deforestation (28 percent), agriculture (24 percent), logging (4 percent) and charcoal (1 percent). Though those figures are from 2003, Sakamoto says they still apply, with cattle ranches and sugar cane plantations among the top employers. Anti-slavery International estimates there are 12.3 million people working under such conditions worldwide. ""Forced labor exists in Sudan, Nepal, India, Mauritania as well as many wealthier countries (including the UK), where vulnerable people are trafficked into forced labor or sexual slavery,"" the group says. ""A similar situation to the use of forced labor on estates in Brazil can be found in the Chaco region of both Paraguay and Bolivia."" But what may set Brazil apart are the government's attempts to wipe out the practice. One of Brazil's chief tools is a ""Special Mobile Inspection Group"" that consists of labor inspectors, federal police and attorneys from the federal labor prosecution branch. The group often raids workplaces, looking for abuses and laborers held against their will. In 2007, the task force freed 5,999 workers, a record number. In 2003, the agency freed 5,223 laborers. Since the group's inception in 1995, it has freed 33,000 people. Labor Minister Carlos Lupi vowed in a recent interview with the state-run Brazilian news agency that efforts will be stepped up this year. ""The Brazilian government is to be commended for rescuing more than 4,500 people from the nightmare of slavery during the past year,"" Aidan McQuade, director of Anti-Slavery International, said in a statement to CNN. ""Their commitment to step up their efforts in 2009 is even more heartening. The vocal and effective leadership we are seeing from Brazil is rare. Even India, like Brazil a democracy and a G20 member, seems content to remain the country with the most slaves in the world."" Poverty fuels slave labor, experts say . But everyone agrees it's going to take more than police efforts to seriously dent the practice. ""Slave labor is not a disease,"" Sakamoto said. ""It's like a fever. Fever is a symptom that something is wrong."" That something is widespread poverty. Although the poverty rate dropped recently to its lowest levels in 25 years, nearly one of every four Brazilians still lives in poverty, according to a 2006 survey by the Getulio Vargas Foundation's Center for Social Policy Studies. The Web-based Index Mundi, which says it obtains its figures from the CIA World Factbook, estimates the poverty rate could be as high as one of every three Brazilians. With a population approaching 200 million people, that means at least 49 million Brazilians live under squalid economic conditions. ""We have poverty. We have greed. And we have impunity,"" Sakamoto said. ""We have to fight these three pieces at the same time. We have been fighting against impunity and we have been fighting against greed, but we are just starting to fight against poverty."" The situation is made worse because of Brazil's vastness -- about the size of the United States. ""Brazil is a big, huge country and there are lots of poor people,"" said Hakim of the Inter-American Dialogue. ""The farther you get away from the populated, industrialized areas, you'll find large populations of people who do whatever they can to make a living."" And slave labor seems to be spreading. ""We are discovering new occurrences of slave labor in regions where we hadn't registered slave labor in Brazil,"" the Rev. Xavier Plassat of the Catholic Pastoral Land Commission told the independent Radioagencia NP. Opposition to laws . By most accounts, the administration of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who took office in 2003, has done much to reduce poverty and fight slave labor. But Brazil's agricultural, mining and manufacturing sectors are large and well-developed. And they are politically powerful. ""We have a very, very strong agribusiness sector,"" Sakamoto said. ""It is very, very difficult to get other measures to fight against slave labor."" For example, he said, a proposed law for the government to confiscate land on which slave labor is used has languished in congress for years. ""There's a group of very strong congressmen fighting against it,"" said Sakamoto, who is also a member Brazil's National Commission for the Eradication of Slave Labor. There are those who object to use of the word ""slavery"" or the phrase ""slave labor,"" saying it mischaracterizes the situation. ""The word has very heavy connotations regarding 19th century slavery,"" said Latin America scholar Robert Pastor, a former National Security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and now a professor of international relations at American University in Washington. ""Modern-day practices are quite distinct from what we normally thought of as slavery."" But Pastor agrees that no matter what you call it, what is happening in Brazil and elsewhere is ""a phenomenon that is based on a simple intent to exploit individuals."" Paulo Sotero, director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, also believes that calling the practice slavery overstates the case. ""To use the word 'slave labor' sometimes does not describe what it is,"" Sotero said from Washington. ""It's more unfair, abusive labor conditions.""

"(CNN) -- What on Earth would drive a man to swim in Arctic waters wearing nothing but Speedos, goggles and a cap? Lewis Pugh braves the icy water off the arctic archipelogo of Svalbard. For Lewis Pugh, it was a love of the environment and a passionate desire to save the Arctic from global warming. His 1 km swim (0.62 of a mile) in 2007 made him the first person to complete a long-distance swim at the North Pole -- the purpose, to highlight the fact that it was possible to swim for a kilometer in a place that should be solid ice. Pugh, now aged 39, is a former maritime lawyer who abandoned his practice six years ago to become a full-time environmentalist and adventurer. Since then he has become the first person to complete long-distance swims in all five of the world's oceans and has become the world's leading cold water swimmer. Born in England and brought up in South Africa, Pugh sees himself in the mould of pioneering British adventurers like Sir Edmund Hillary, fearlessly braving waters no one else would dare swim. But rather than just aiming for a place in the history books, his motivation is to publicize the environmental damage he has witnessed on his swims. In 2006, to raise awareness about global warming and that year's drought in England, Pugh swam the entire length of the River Thames -- all except the first 26 miles, which had already dried up. He took a break from the 200-mile journey to call in at No. 10 Downing Street, where he discussed climate change with Tony Blair. The next year, Pugh became the first person to swim the 87 mile-width of the Maldives. The 10-day swim was Pugh's way of raising awareness of how climate change is threatening to submerge low-lying islands. But he is best known for his North Pole adventure. His Arctic swim lasted 19 minutes in temperatures of around minus 2 degrees Celsius. Were any normal person to fall into waters that cold they would be in serious trouble. Pugh's long-time coach Professor Tim Noakes told CNN, ""People usually drown very quickly on exposure to cold water because they start to hyperventilate and when you hyperventilate you can't coordinate. They inhale water and they can't coordinate their swimming. Most people can't even go 20 meters if they are exposed to ice-cold water."" But Pugh has developed a unique mechanism for overcoming freezing conditions. He is apparently able to increase his body temperature by will power alone. In a process that Noakes has dubbed ""anticipatory thermogenesis"", Pugh can raise his body temperature to a feverish 38.4 C, some 1.5 degrees above normal body temperature. Noakes first noted this extraordinary ability during a training session. Before entering the water, Pugh cast his mind back to a traumatic parachuting accident he witnessed when he was a soldier in the British army, reliving the event in detail. Noakes recorded an increase in Pugh's body temperature and over the next fortnight, as Pugh was exposed to more cold-water swims, he was able to increase his temperature even further, peaking at 38.4 C. These days, before Pugh braves sub-zero waters he listens to U.S.rapper Eminem, gets himself into an aggressive state of mind and drives up his internal temperature. Once he hits the water, it's all about mental strength. Noakes told CNN ""The moment you dive into cold water your temperature drops and the brain sends a message to get out of the water. The first thing Pugh has to do is control that response. What happens is that I become his brain, so he says 'fine, as long as Dr Noakes allows me to swim, it's safe and I must just ignore what my brain is telling me.'"" Achieving that level of willpower doesn't come easily. While Pugh does an hour of cold-water swimming a day, he devotes four hours a day to mind training. His technique is to visualize his swim from beginning to end. ""I can taste salt water in my mouth. I can hear the sounds of the engines, of Tim Noakes screaming at me. I can feel ice burning my skin, I can smell the sea air. I absolutely live that moment. I have swum the North Pole hundreds of times in my mind,"" he told CNN. If the Arctic swim was intended to highlight shrinking polar ice caps, Pugh acknowledges that there's still plenty of work to do on that front and he now speaks on environmental issues all over the world. In 2008 Pugh founded the Polar Defense Project with the aim of protecting the Arctic and of encouraging world leaders to take action to stop climate change. As well the risk of polar melting, Pugh sees an Arctic treaty as essential to prevent the exploitation of the North Pole for oil and gas. As Pugh put it after completing his Arctic swim, ""I'm relieved that it's over. Now the real work begins.""","Lewis Pugh was the first man to complete a long-distance swim in the Arctic .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Federal prosecutors on Wednesday filed murder charges against two men suspected in the deaths of a charter boat crew, authorities said. The Joe Cool charter boat was found abandoned last month in the Florida Straits. Kirby Archer, 34, and Guillermo Zarabozo, 19, are scheduled to appear in court Thursday afternoon. The men are being held without bail on suspicion of killing the four-member crew of the Joe Cool fishing boat last month. ""Four individuals were killed in this case,"" Alex Acosta, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, told reporters Wednesday in announcing the charges. ""Four families have been torn apart.""  Watch what led to the charges » . Archer and Zarabozo paid $4,000 in cash for a one-way trip to the Bahamas on the pleasure boat. The U.S. Coast Guard found the abandoned vessel about 160 miles south of the island of Bimini on September 23. It was unmanned, and its contents were in disarray. Zarabozo and Archer were found a few hours later on a life raft 10 miles from the boat. Missing are the boat's captain, Jake Branam; his wife, Kelly; and crew members Scott Gamble and Samuel Kairy. Zarabozo reportedly told a Coast Guard agent that three armed Cuban men hijacked the boat as it headed toward Bimini. Zarabozo, a licensed security guard, said the hijackers shot the crew members and forced him to throw their bodies overboard. But, according to court documents filed in the case, Zarabozo and Archer gave inconsistent stories during interviews with authorities regarding what occurred. Statements given by the pair were not consistent with physical evidence, according to an affidavit supporting the murder charges. Zarabozo, for instance, told federal authorities he did not own a gun, but an investigation showed he had bought a lock box for a gun he kept at his home. That lock box contained various documents, including a receipt for a February 2007 purchase of a Glock 9 mm magazine and four boxes of bullets. ""Little of the defendants' story rings true,"" Acosta said. At a bond hearing last week, the Coast Guard agent said two bullet casings and suspected blood were discovered inside the Joe Cool's cabin. A third bullet casing was found outside the cabin, he said. All three casings were 9 mm. A fourth 9 mm casing was found on the boat later by family members, who turned it over to the FBI, a relative said. ""Now you have four casings and four people [presumed] dead,"" said Jeffrey Branam, the uncle of the boat's captain. Archer is charged with unlawful flight on an Arkansas warrant, accused of stealing more than $90,000 in cash from a Wal-Mart where he once worked. Last week, a judge said he believes circumstantial evidence shows four homicides took place. ""Your theory is [Archer and Zarabozo] killed the four?"" the judge asked the assistant U.S. attorney at the bond hearing. ""Yes, your honor,"" the prosecutor replied. The Coast Guard spent five days searching for the crew before giving up. Acosta said it is unlikely their bodies will ever be found. Jake Branam and his wife leave behind two small children, he said. ""It's difficult,"" Jeffrey Branam said last week. ""Some relatives still think the four are alive and are still searching for them."" He said the name of the boat has been removed from the stern, and the name will be retired from the charter fishing business. The boat probably will be retired, too. Referring to Archer and Zarabozo, Branam said: ""I'd like to use them as shark bait.""  E-mail to a friend .","Two defendants to make initial appearances in federal court Thursday .

"(CNN) -- From songs to poems to sayings on the side of coffee cups, everyone tries to define love in words. Liz Kelly donated her kidney to her fiance after he was diagnosed with congestive heart failure. But often, it's the extraordinary actions we take in the name of love that really define it. Liz Kelly's fiance, Matt House, needed a kidney after he was diagnosed with congestive heart failure. In order to get him to the top of the donor list, Kelly signed up to donate hers. At first, she never dreamed she would actually be a match, but it turned out she was. The Springfield, Massachusetts, couple (he's 31, she's 29) spoke with CNN's Nicole Lapin about whether Kelly thought fate played a hand in finding him a donor match. The following is an edited transcript of the interview: . Nicole Lapin: Liz, I didn't know about the donor process, until we started talking to you guys. The donor process works whereby a friend or a family member can donate a kidney to get Matt higher on the list, so you decided that you were going to do that. Why did you decide to do that?  Watch Nicole Lapin's interview with Liz Kelly and Matt House » . Liz Kelly: It was pretty much a no-brainer, I think. His sister was actually going to donate at first. But she didn't work out for health reasons. It's obviously better to have, you know, a family member donate a kidney, too. But since that wasn't going to work out, his stepfather stepped in because they were the same blood type. And that ended up not working out either. He had some heart issues and some other health issues. So, I said, you know what, I'll just donate to the list. And that's what I was intending on doing. And then I found out that we were actually a match, and it was amazing. Lapin: It was amazing, I'm sure, to get that phone call, because you did it just so that you could get higher on the list. A lot of people on our Web site are fascinated by your story, guys. [A viewer] has a question for you right now, Liz: Have you ever had any surgeries before this one? If not, how did your prepare yourself for this? Kelly: No. This was my first surgery, so that definitely made me very nervous. That was the definitely scariest part for me, just not knowing what to expect. But, Matt has been through several surgeries before. So I know I had him in my corner. And I looked up a lot online. I found out a lot of great information online. So that's definitely how I prepared. Lapin: And [another viewer] has a question in for Matt, actually: Were you scared that perhaps your body might reject Liz's kidney or were you always confident that the surgery would be a success? Matt House: I think I was pretty confident with her being the same blood type or us matching is pretty phenomenal, so I didn't expect it to reject it anyway. Maybe after the surgery if I would have a little pain down there or something like that, I would get a little nervous and think that it was going to reject, that there's something wrong. But that would just pass. It was me just being a little overanxious, I guess, but not really, no. I was pretty confident everything would go well overall. We're both pretty healthy for the most part. And being the same blood type was just you know really great, so it worked out good. So, I wasn't really worried at all. Lapin: Fate, some may say? House: Yeah, yeah, definitely. Lapin: Yours is a lot bigger. You're a little girl, but you happen to have a kidney that is perfect for Matt. Do you think it was meant to be? Kelly: I do. I definitely do. People tell me that all the time. When they told us that we were a match, I was very surprised at first, but then I thought about it a little more. Of course we were a match. How could we not be a match?","Liz Kelly offered to donate kidney to move her ill fiance higher on donor list .

"(CNN) -- Passengers on the US Airways flight that crash-landed into the Hudson River Thursday afternoon praised the actions and courage of the pilot, a safety consultant with 40 years of experience in the aviation industry. Chesley B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger, a former Air Force fighter pilot, has been with US Airways since 1980. Sources tell CNN that Chesley B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger was piloting US Airways flight 1549 from New York's LaGuardia airport to Charlotte, North Carolina, when at least one of the plane's engines failed. Passenger Jeff Kolodjay offered ""kudos"" to Sullenberger for a landing that minimized damage to the aircraft and its 155 passengers and crew. ""All of a sudden the captain came on and he told us to brace ourselves and probably brace ourselves pretty hard. But he did an amazing job -- kudos to him on that landing,"" said Kolodjay, who was sitting in seat 22A. Sullenberger's wife told CNN that she was stunned to hear the news from her husband after it was all over. ""I hadn't been watching the news. I've heard Sully say to people, 'It's rare for an airline pilot to have an incident in their career,' "" said Lori Sullenberger of Danville, California. ""When he called me he said, 'There's been an accident.' At first I thought it was something minor, but then he told me the circumstances and my body started shaking and I rushed to get our daughters out of school."" US Airways said all 155 passengers and crew are alive and safely off the plane. The crash-landing has also earned the former fighter pilot and private safety consultant accolades from state and government officials. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg commended the pilot for not leaving the plane without checking to make sure every passenger had been evacuated. ""It would appear that the pilot did a masterful job of landing the plane in the river and then making sure that everybody got out,"" Bloomberg said at a press conference Thursday. ""I had a long conversation with the pilot. He walked the plane twice after everybody else was off and tried to verify that there was nobody else on board -- and assures us there was not."" Sullenberger apparently was forced to make an emergency landing after geese were sucked into one or both of the jet's engines. An eyewitness working on the west side of Manhattan said the belly of the plane touched the water first. An official who heard tape recordings of the radio traffic from Flight 1549 reported the pilot was extraordinarily calm during the event. ""There was no panic, no hysterics,"" the official said. ""It was professional, it was calm, it was methodical. It was everything you hoped it could be."" The pilot and air traffic controller discussed options, including landing at Teterboro airport in New Jersey, the official said. Then there was a ""period of time where there was no communications back, and I'm assuming he was concentrating on more important things."" Sullenberger's background in aviation appeared to have prepared him for such a situation. He has been a pilot with US Airways since 1980, following seven years in the U.S. Air Force. His resume -- posted on the Web site for his safety consulting firm, Safety Reliability Methods, Inc. -- lists piloting procedures, technical safety strategies, emergency management and operations improvement, as areas of industry expertise. He served as an instructor and Air Line Pilots Association safety chairman, accident investigator and national technical committee member, according to a biography on the site. He participated in several USAF and National Transportation Safety Board accident investigations, and worked with NASA scientists on a paper on error and aviation, his site says. For the passengers on flight 1549, Sullenberger's skill and expertise were apparent. iReport.com: Did you see the crash-landing? Send images . ""I've flown in a lot of planes and that was a phenomenal landing,"" said passenger Fred Berretta said. Berretta was sitting in seat 16A right over one of the engines when it failed and the pilot turned the plane to align it with the Hudson River. He described silence in the plane as the passengers waited to hear from the crew. A few moments later, the direction to brace for landing came. ""It was an amazing piece of airmanship,"" said Peter Goelz, a former NTSB managing director.","NEW: Chesley B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger has been a pilot with US Airways since 1980 .

"(CNN) -- When the stirring speeches, heavyweight debates and fevered campaigning of the U.S. elections are long forgotten, a handful of far less noble incidents are  likely to be our enduring memories of the 2008 White House race. ""Hey America, I'm Paris Hilton and I'm a celebrity too."" While the candidates would like us to view their bids for the top job as an honorable battle of wits, policies, values and big issues, the sad truth is that it's more likely to boil down to a list of gaffes, embarrassments and sideshows. Both Democratic and Republican PR machines have been working hard to keep their campaigns on-script, but with a cast list of John McCain, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Sarah Palin and the Clintons, they had their work cut out. Alaskan ""hockey mom"" Palin's late arrival undoubtedly stirred things up, adding a dash of vigor as the race lumbered into its final straight, but even before she began stealing the show, there was no shortage of scrapbook moments. Sound off: Which do you think are the most memorable moments from the 2008 election? In no particular order, here is a selection of some of the best: . 1. Crying game: Back in January's New Hampshire primaries, Hillary Clinton welled up with emotion, almost crying into her coffee cup during a chat with voters. This unexpected exposure of her human side was credited with winning back some women supporters. Read more . 2. McCain bombs: John McCain displayed rather off-key singing and diplomacy skills when asked if there was a plan to attack Iran back in April 2007. Changing the words to the classic Beach Boys' song ""Barbara Ann,"" the Arizona senator responded: ""Bomb bomb bomb, bomb bomb Iran."" Read more . 3. Pastor disaster: Proving once again that religion and politics don't mix, Barack Obama was forced to distance himself from his former pastor and mentor Jeremiah Wright, after a series of pulpit fulminations in which he made racially-charged criticisms of Hillary Clinton and said of the 9/11 terror attacks: ""American's chickens are coming home to roost."" Read more . 4. Ramblin' man: Garrulous ""gaffe machine"" Joe Biden got the last word in a primary debate about his tendency to speak his mind and not shut up. Asked if he could hold his tongue enough to ""reassure your voters in this country that you have the discipline you would need on the world stage,"" Biden replied succinctly: ""Yes."" Read more . 5. The pig issue: Obama may have been hoping to generate oinks of outrage when he commented in September that McCain's policies were like ""lipstick on a pig,"" after the Arizona senator named Sarah Palin as running mate. The Democratic candidate refused to apologize for what Republicans said was a misogynistic response to Palin's own claim to be a pitbull in lipstick. You couldn't make it up.  Read more . 6. Miss-firing: Hillary Clinton had her campaign guns blazing in March when she described the drama of a visit to Bosnia 12 years earlier. ""I remember landing under sniper fire,"" she said. Clinton was later forced to admit ""misspeaking"" after video footage of the event showed her strolling leisurely from the aircraft. Read more . 7. Ordinary Joe: First there was Joe Biden, then there was Palin's mythical beer swiller Joe Sixpack and finally there was Joe the Plumber -- just a regular guy worried about his business going down the drain. Despite not actually being a licensed plumber, and not even being called Joe, he has been seized on by McCain as an everyman hero. This endorsement sprung more leaks when Joe failed to appear on cue to a recent McCain event. Read more . 8. Bad business: Neither presidential candidate makes claim to being psychic, but McCain might have done better consulting his tea leaves rather than the advisors who led him to say ""the fundamentals of our economy are strong"" on the eve of America's worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.

Palintology: Her political skills aside, moose-shooting Sarah Palin has been an unfortunately prolific headline generator for the Republican campaign, whether eyeing Russia from her Alaskan home, shopping for suits, stumbling over questions from Katie Couric or introducing her pregnant teenage daughter.

Barack=Britney: Celebrity endorsements are one thing, but McCain's campaign ad comparing his rival to pop star Britney Spears and heiress Paris Hilton was seen by at least one person as taking things a little too far.

"(CNN) -- The surgeon who operated Wednesday on cyclist Lance Armstrong after he fractured his collarbone declared the procedure a success, but one that will require two to three months of healing. Lance Armstrong's doctor says he used a plate and 12 inch-long screws to stabilize the fractured bone. ""Surgery was tough, but went well,"" said Dr. Douglas Elenz, an orthopedic surgeon in Austin, Texas, who performed the three-hour procedure two days after Armstrong fractured his collarbone into four pieces during a race in Spain. The multiple breaks ""made treatment more challenging, but we're confident that the treatment performed today is going to be successful,"" he said. Elenz said he used a 4- to 5-inch plate that he attached with 12 inch-long screws to stabilize the fractured bone. Armstrong, 37, was to be released later in the day. On a scale of one to 10 rating the difficulty of the operation,  Elenz said he would pin it down at eight. Elenz was noncommittal regarding when Armstrong can return to racing.  Watch more about the crash » . ""We are just taking it day by day, week by week, month by month. Every fracture is unique. Each time I go to treat one, something is different."" During the next week, Armstrong ""will need to take it easy"" to ensure the wound does not become infected, the doctor said. After his wound has healed, Armstrong will begin using an exercise bike to train his lower body, ""but we won't let him do a whole lot with his upper extremities,"" Elenz said. ""After several weeks, we can take his training to the street, but we will need to take that day by day and week by week."" Over the longer term, Elenz will be looking for evidence that Armstrong is laying down new bone, that the plate is stable, that the athlete's arm is strong and that his motion is fluid, he said. ""His pain will give us insight on how well he is healing,"" the sports specialist said. ""It will take eight to 12 weeks to heal completely. But we are going to have to push the envelope a bit to have him train before he is completely healed.""

Armstrong announced last year that he was returning to competitive biking and would use the Spanish race as a warm-up for the Tour de France, which he won seven times before announcing his retirement in 2005. He also had planned to race May 9-31 in the Giro d'Italia, one of Europe's most prestigious and grueling stage races. This would have been the second comeback of his career. His first came in 1998, two years after he was diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain. Doctors gave him a less than 50 percent chance of survival.

"BROOKLYN CENTER, Minnesota (CNN) -- Thousands of Liberians living in the United States face deportation March 31 when a federal immigration status created for humanitarian purposes expires. Corvah Akoiwala is worried about what will happen to his children, born in the U.S., when he is sent to Liberia. In the 1990s, a bloody civil war raged through the West African nation, killing 250,000 people and displacing more than a million, according to a U.N. report. The United States extended ""temporary protection status"" to all Liberians who could get to America, and 14,000 of them took advantage of that humanitarian offer. Temporary protection status is an immigration status somewhere between political asylum and refugee status. Administered by the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, it is extended to nationals of countries facing civil unrest or natural disaster. For years, the temporary protection status for Liberians was extended as the situation there worsened under dictator Charles Taylor. But Taylor was ousted in 2003 and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was elected Liberia's first female president in 2006. In 2007, citing the progress in Liberia, President George W. Bush signed an order of ""delayed enforced departure"" for Liberians who had been under temporary protection status, giving them 18 months to return to Liberia. Watch more on the uncertainty of Liberians living in U.S. » . Corvah Akoiwala, a Liberian national who was fresh out of college when civil war broke out, remembers how it used to be there. ""They dragged us from our homes, they were shooting all around us. They said they were going to have us killed,"" he said . ""On Tupero Road they had a killing field. Like every day they took someone to this field and they would just shoot them in front of everybody. It was just terrible,"" he said. He came to the United States in 1992 and settled in Rhode Island. A civil engineer by education, Akoiwala married and had three children, all of whom are American citizens. For the past 17 years he's worked, paid his taxes and contributed to his community. He and his wife were granted temporary protection status but now both face deportation. On March 31 they will go from being legal residents to illegal aliens. ""My fear is, who am I going to leave my kids with?"" he said. ""Who am I going to leave them with? I want to stay here and see them grow up to be responsible citizens and then I can go back."" The Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services said approximately 3,600 Liberian nationals are facing delayed enforced departure, but Liberian community leaders think the number may be twice that because, they said, many Liberians went underground and did not reregister with immigration services, knowing the delayed enforced departure status meant leaving the country. Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, about an hour north of Minneapolis, has a thriving Liberian community. Many now worry about losing their jobs, homes and businesses. Seyondi Roberts, a hairdresser, said 65 percent of her customers are Liberians facing delayed enforced departure. ""We're praying that they don't send them back. But if they do, it will have a serious effect on the business. I do mainly African hair, so it's going to have a real big, big impact on the business,"" she said. Aba Hamilton Dolo also lives in the Brooklyn Center area and is slated for departure. She said she has nightmares and panic attacks at the prospect of being separated from her two young American-born children. ""Please consider what would happen to our families if we were sent home,"" she begs.  Dolo: 'I have nightmares' » . ""Many of these Liberians have become important parts of the communities where they live in the United States,"" said Sen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island. There is a large Liberian community in his home state. ""They have children who are citizens of the U.S.,"" he noted. ""How do you leave children behind who are eligible to stay? They've worked very hard, they've played by the rules, and they've paid their taxes. They're here legally. I think that should be considered at least to let them stay."" Reed has been one of the driving forces for extension of the temporary protection status in previous years and is pushing hard again this year for another extension. In addition, he wants a change in the rule that prohibits those on the temporary protection status classification from applying for citizenship. ""They should have the right to become American citizens,"" he said. ""They should be part of immigration reform. We shouldn't pick and choose different immigrant groups."" Critics say Liberians should go back to Liberia when their status runs out. ""It is time for people to go back and rebuild their country,"" said Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. Stein underlines the temporary in ""temporary protected status."" He said for Liberians to stay when their country is at peace would be an abuse of U.S. hospitality. ""It makes a mockery of the concept of short-term temporary humanitarian protection."" Department of Homeland Security deputy spokesman Sean Smith said its Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency is ""consulting with the White House and the State Department to determine the most appropriate course of action"" in regard to the Liberians. CNN's Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report.","14,000 Liberians took advantage of U.S. temporary status during civil war .

"(CNN) -- European Union peacekeepers in Bosnia on Tuesday raided homes belonging to family members of Ratko Mladic, the highest-ranking figure still at large from the Balkan conflict in the mid 1990s, Serbian media reported. Portuguese peacekeepers stand guard outside a home raided on Tuesday. The force raided houses belonging to Mladic's sister, Milica Avram, and sister-in-law, Radinka Mladic, in East Sarajevo, an area of the city inside the Bosnian Serb-controlled Republika Srpska, a seperate political entity to the Muslim-Croat-controlled Bosnia-Croat Federation. The raids were a part of a broader operation targeting locations and people who are believed to be helping Mladic evade trial, the reports said. Serbian authorities recently put up ""wanted"" posters for Mladic at police stations across Serbia, reminding people of the 1 million euro ($1.3 million) reward for any information leading to Mladic's capture. Mladic, who commanded the Bosnian Serb military during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, has been the Balkans' most wanted since former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic was arrested in Belgrade last July. The 66-year-old is wanted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for allegedly overseeing the killings of almost 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys in the town of Srebrenica in July 1995. Mladic is charged with genocide, crimes against humanity, and violations of the laws of war. He has been on the run for 13 years, ever since the ICTY issued the indictments against him. The ICTY has accused Serbia of knowing Mladic's whereabouts and letting him slip through their hands. Serbia's status as a candidate for European Union membership also remains conditional on Mladic being handed over to the ICTY. Serbian leaders have denied protecting Mladic.","EU troops in Bosnia raid homes belonging to family members of Ratko Mladic .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- From four leaf clovers to a severed rabbit's foot, when it comes to lucky mascots reason and taste often go out of the window. David Beckham's teammates give his bottom a squeeze after scoring his first goal for AC Milan in their 4-1 defeat of Bologna. No more so than at AC Milan where one charm is being held responsible for the team's recent upturn in fortunes on the pitch: David Beckham's bottom. Since Beckham's arrival at the San Siro, the England midfielder has started every game and scored his first goal in last weekend's demolition of Bologna. But as he walked away after celebrating the goal, Clarence Seedorf and Andrea Pirlo both stroked his left bum cheek.   This was apparently because they believe Beckham's posterior has as much to do with Milan's revival as his sweet right foot. ""Italy is a superstitious country, people touch things for luck,"" an AC Milan spokesperson told UK newspaper ""The Sun."" ""Now the players are doing the same thing with Becks' bottom. He is seen as lucky."" Have your say: what are the strangest footballing superstitions that you have seen?  One English newspaper has even taken to calling him ""Goldenbuns"", a play on ""Goldenballs"", the pet name his wife Victoria uses and for which he is still good naturedly mocked when it emerged in the press. Football has a long history of superstitions. Below are some of the strangest rituals: . Kissing Fabien Barthez's head Barthez's big shiny pate became something of a totem for the French during the 1998 World Cup. The ritual was always the same. Veteran defender Laurent Blanc would approach his eccentric goalkeeper before planting a kiss on the top of his head. The team insisted that Blanc maintained the tradition as Les Bleus reached the finals. The French ended up beating Brazil 3-0. Goalmouth: Beckham ""dreams"" of Milan move. Beanie the Horse watches the action With his blond hair, steely grimace and piercing stare, Stuart Pearce was known on the pitch for his hard tackling, no-nonsense ways. Off it he's, well, a bit of a softy. Whilst in charge of Manchester City the former England defender started bringing a rather bizarre charm, placing it near the dug out so it could observe the action: Beanie, a cuddly woolen horse. It didn't do him much good. He was fired later that season. Blessing from a juju man ""Juju"" men used to be a regular fixture at African football matches. These self-appointed holy men would bless or curse teams for money. Even government ministers were seduced by them. When the Ivory Coast won the African Cup of Nations in 1992,  the government claimed it was because the sports minister paid a ""juju"" man to bless the team. But he angered them by refusing to pay up. The result? A hex that saw the team endure a miserable ten year losing streak.   Tired of defeat, the government begged the juju men for forgiveness, coughing up the $2000. Ivory Coast promptly qualified for the 2006 World Cup. Invoking the power of the Virgin Mary Take a look at Newcastle United's goalkeeper Shay Given before a match. If you look carefully you'll notice him dropping a bottle into the back of the goal.   No, not a bottle full of Gatorade but rather a small vial of Holy Water from Lourdes, France. It was there that it is claimed the Virgin Mary appeared in 1858. It has since become a place of pilgrimage for the sick, drawn to the allegedly healing waters.  ""I carry it in my kit bag and it goes everywhere with me,"" Given said back in 2002. At the time of writing, Given is still injury free. If all else fails, urinate... When Barry Fry, then Birmingham City's boss, watched his team lose another game, enough was enough. For years the club had suffered from dismal form at their St Andrews ground in Birmingham, England, and had not won anything of note for decades. The reason, fans and club officials feared, was a gypsy curse spat out at the club's owners when they evicted a band of travelers to make way for their new stadium. Managers had tried and failed to lift the curse -- one even placed crucifixes in the floodlights, but it was Barry Fry who had the most ingenious method. He urinated in each corner of the ground. Birmingham City haven't won anything of note since.  Employing an Ecuadorian warlock Tzamarenda Naychapi played a pivotal role in Ecuador's 2006 World Cup campaign.   The UK's Guardian newspaper described how Naychapi - a warlock who was described as a ""witch doctor-cum-shaman-cum-priest-type-fella"" - traveled to Germany before the World Cup to cast spells on all 12 stadiums, not to mention the pitch and the goals, in a bid to turn the gods in Ecuador's favor.   The South American minnows went on to shock both Costa Rica and Poland, qualifying for the second round for the first time in their history before losing to England 1-0. But then again England had their own magical good luck charm to call upon. David Beckham scored the only goal.","David Beckham's bottom becomes AC Milan's lucky charm .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Canada geese got into both engines of US Airways Flight 1549 and forced the plane to ditch into the Hudson River last month, the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday. Surveillance video shows passengers of US Airways Flight 1549 hurrying onto the plane's wings. The flight crew of the Airbus A320 put the plane down gently on the river, which separates New York from New Jersey, after the bird ingestion caused both engines to lose power on January 15. All 155 people aboard survived. Adult Canada geese weigh between 5.8 and 10.7 pounds, although birds from resident populations rather than migratory populations can be heavier. The plane's CFM56-5B/P turbofan engines were certified in 1996 as being able to withstand bird ingestion of 4 pounds. The NTSB said last week that both engines contained the remains of birds, confirming the pilots' report that the engines shut down after colliding with birds less than two minutes after taking off from from New York's LaGuardia Airport. Material from both engines was sent to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington for identification of the bird species. Investigators have not yet determined how many birds hit the jet's engines. The plane's flight data recorder ""revealed no anomalies or malfunctions in either engine up to the point where the captain reported a bird strike, after which there was an uncommanded loss of thrust in both engines,"" the NTSB said last week.","Investigators have yet to determine how many birds hit the plane's engines .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan announced a 10-day cease-fire on Sunday in Pakistan's Swat Valley, a volatile region in North West Frontier Province that is largely controlled by the Taliban. The Taliban says it has agreed a 10-day cease-fire with Pakistani forces in the Swat Valley. The Taliban are holding talks with the North West Frontier Province's government in the town of Timagera in the province's Lower Dir district, he said. Taliban leader Sufi Mohammad is heading negotiations for the militants. There was no immediate confirmation of the cease-fire from the Pakistani government. Swat Valley was once Pakistan's biggest tourist destination until it was overrun by militants led by radical cleric Maulana Fazlullah. The valley boasted the country's only ski resort and was once a draw for trout-fishing enthusiasts. It is believed to be the deepest advance by militants into Pakistan's settled areas -- meaning areas outside its tribal region along the border with Afghanistan. The negotiations are the latest attempt by Pakistan's civilian government -- which took power last year -- to achieve peace through diplomacy in areas where Taliban and al Qaeda leaders are believed to have free rein. Swat has been overrun by forces loyal to Maulana Fazlullah's banned hardline Islamic group, Tehreek Nifaz-e-Shariat Mohammadi (TNSM) which has allied itself with Taliban fighters. TNSM was once led by Sufi Mohammed, Fazlullah's father-in-law who is leading the latest negotiations. Sufi Mohammed was released from jail last year by Pakistani authorities after he agreed to cooperate with the government. He had been jailed in 2002 after recruiting thousands of fighters to battle U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Fazlullah took over TNSM during Sufi Mohammed's jail stint and vowed to continue his fight to impose fundamentalist Islamic law in the region. Last May, Pakistan's government announced it reached a peace deal with militants in Swat Valley. Analysts as well as critics within the establishment have described those talks as a failure that gave the Taliban time to regroup and gain more ground. The Taliban have recently targeted local politicians, including the head of the Awami National Party -- which represents the region -- who was forced to flee to Islamabad. Pakistan is under enormous pressure to control the militants within its borders, blamed for launching attacks in neighboring Afghanistan where U.S. and NATO forces are fighting militants. Pakistan's military operation in the region is unpopular among Pakistanis, but efforts to deal diplomatically with militants have not worked in the past. Pakistan's previous military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, reached a cease-fire deal with militants in South Waziristan in 2006 which was widely blamed for giving al Qaeda and Taliban a stronger foothold in the region. CNN's Zein Basravi contributed to this report.","Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan announces a 10-day cease-fire in Swat Valley .

"(CNN)  -- Be bold! Think big! Barack Obama wants to do just that. An $800 billion economic stimulus plan. Three million jobs. Health care reform. A restructured automobile industry. Obama's popularity with voters will win him influence with political opponents. Obama won the biggest Democratic majority for president in 44 years. His party made big gains in Congress. Democrats now have a majority of nearly 60 percent in both the House and Senate. President Obama's got a mandate. And a majority. What's to stop him? Just this: the U.S. system of government. It is set up to make it difficult to get things done. The Constitution was written 222 years ago by men who didn't trust government. They had just waged a revolution against a king. To the founders of the American republic, strong government meant despotism. So they set up a system with an elaborate separation of powers. The idea was to ensure weak government. The dirty little secret of American government is that it was designed not to work very well. As president after president has discovered, there are innumerable ways opponents can stop measures from getting passed, even if the president's party holds a majority in Congress. The Senate has its own rule that's not in the Constitution requiring a super-majority of 60 Senate votes to control the agenda. A minority of 41 senators can ""filibuster'' a measure and prevent it from coming up for a vote. How many votes will Republicans have in the Senate? 41 or 42, depending on the outcome in Minnesota where ballots are still being counted. Presidents often have problems holding their own party together. That's because members of Congress are elected by local constituencies and they are expected to represent local interests. American politicians are independent political entrepreneurs. They are not foot-soldiers of a party. When Bill Clinton first became president, he had a solid Democratic majority in Congress. But he could not get his health care reform plan passed. After an intense advertising campaign by opponents, many Americans were worried that the Clintons were planning a government takeover of the health care system. The Clinton plan failed, and within two years, Democrats lost their majority in Congress. One-party control didn't work any better for George W. Bush. Bush had trouble getting what he wanted -- notably, immigration reform -- from a Republican Congress. Republicans lost their majority in Congress in 2006. But here's another dirty little secret of American government: it often does work. Very well in fact. Under the right conditions, barriers fall away and things get done, sometimes with amazing speed and efficiency. What are the right conditions? An overwhelming sense of public urgency. That sense of urgency certainly existed after 9/11, when Congress quickly passed the Patriot Act. Getting anything big done in American government requires a sense of crisis. That's why politicians in the U.S. are always declaring crises -- a drug crisis, an education crisis, an environmental crisis. Or they're trying to rally the country to fight a war on something -- a war on poverty, a war on crime. If the public urgency is not authentic, however, opponents won't have much trouble stopping things from happening. Obama certainly takes office at a time of crisis, just as Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt did. Like them, he has the opportunity to transform American government. Members of Congress who try to block President Obama's program may find themselves in political trouble. Because there is yet another dirty little secret of American government: the United States is the most populist democracy in the world. Here, the people rule. When the people want something, they will get it, whether it's the death penalty or gun rights or lower taxes. Why doesn't the United States have a metric system or dollar coins like other countries? Because the people won't use them. Obama's popularity is soaring right now. When a president is popular, he has clout. Everyone wants to be on his side, even members of the opposition party. They're in business for themselves, and supporting a popular president is good for business. Standing in his way could drive them out of business. American government is not an efficient, well-oiled machine. It was never designed to be. It has to be lubricated by public pressure. If the people are shouting ""Do something!'' -- as they are right now -- then something will happen. Even if it means a lot more spending and a lot more government. The people reserve one key right: they will let the government know, rather quickly, whether or not it's working.","Three secrets behind the way U.S. government works .
It was designed to ensure weak government .
In times of crisis usual barriers fall away .
If voters want something done, it will get done somehow ."
"(CNN) -- Scabby the Rat may not have a word to say, but the large rodent-shaped balloon helped a labor union earn a free-speech victory Thursday before New Jersey's highest court. Big Sky Balloons, based in Chicago, Illinois, rents out ""union rats"" like Scabby and other inflatables. The seven justices ruled unanimously that the local union had a right to display its 10-foot-tall, black, rat-shaped balloon at a rally held outside a fitness center. At issue was whether a township could enforce a ban on inflatable or portable signs and banners on public property. Lawrence Township police had levied a $100 fine against an official from the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers because of Scabby. The court concluded that while townships have a right to maintain an ""aesthetic environment"" and ensure public safety, its restrictions on expressive displays ""do not justify a content-based restriction of non-commercial speech."" ""There is no evidence to suggest that a rat balloon is significantly more harmful to aesthetics or safety than a similar item being displayed as an advertisement or commercial logo,"" wrote Justice John Wallace Jr. The balloon and others like it, nicknamed Scabby by the Chicago-based company that made them, have been used by labor unions as street theater since 1990 to protest anti-union activities. IBEW members were marching on the sidewalk outside Gold's Gym in Lawrence Township in April 2005 in response to a dispute with a contractor working at the business. A police officer had ordered the balloon deflated, but returned an hour later to find it blown back up. The labor official in charge admitted he ordered the rat reinflated, and he was given a summons. Lower state courts had ruled the township's ordinance was content-neutral and did not suppress the union's ability to spread its message, since members still could chant and distribute handbills to the public. About 200 Scabby balloons are used by labor unions nationwide, according to Big Sky Balloons. They come in three colors, each showing pink eyes, front claws extended, and two big front incisors.","Court: Towns have right to enforce aesthetics, but not curb speech .

"(CNN) -- A dispatcher who took a 911 call regarding a domestic argument at a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-area home knew that there were weapons in the home but did not notify responding officers, three of whom were fatally shot, an official said Tuesday. Eric Kelly, from left, Paul Sciullo III and Stephen Mayhle were shot to death responding to a 911 call. The officers died Saturday in a gunbattle as they were responding to the call, authorities have said. ""It was pure human error and a terrible thing that occurred,"" Bob Full, chief of emergency services for Allegheny County, told CNN affiliate WTAE. ""In this particular case, our call-taker did not follow through with the appropriate training that she had received and [make] the appropriate notation that there were weapons in the house."" The bodies of the Pittsburgh police officers -- Stephen Mayhle, Paul Sciullo III and Eric Kelly -- are scheduled to lie in repose at Pittsburgh's city-county building Wednesday before a public memorial is held Thursday. Richard Poplawski, 22, is in custody in connection with the shootings. He was hospitalized over the weekend after being shot in the leg during the gunbattle and standoff with police that lasted four hours. Police have not disclosed where he is being held. They said he would be charged with three counts of homicide, aggravated assault and other charges. Poplawski's mother, Margaret, called 911 about 7 a.m. Saturday to report that her son was ""giving her a hard time,"" according to a criminal complaint filed in the case. She told police she awoke to discover that ""the dog had urinated on the floor"" and awakened her son ""to confront him about it,"" and the two argued. Margaret Poplawski told her son that she was calling police to remove him from the home, the complaint said. During that call, according to WTAE, the dispatcher asked Margaret Poplawski, ""does he have any weapons or anything?"" referring to her son. The woman replied, ""Yes."" She paused and then said, ""they're all legal."" ""OK, but he's not threatening you with anything?"" the dispatcher asked. WTAE reported that Margaret Poplawski did not answer directly but said, ""look, I'm just waking up from a sleep, and I want him gone."" Full pointed out that the call was a ""casual conversation"" and that although ""there's no excuse for it whatsoever ... gathering from the casual nature of the call, the call-taker took an inference that [the caller] was not threatened and that guns or weapons were not involved. And it never was relayed to the police officers."" Authorities said the responding officers, Mayhle and Sciullo, were shot as they arrived at the home. Kelly was shot later as he arrived to help them. Police believe that Poplawski, wearing a bulletproof vest, fired more than 100 rounds at officers with an AK-47, another rifle and a pistol, authorities said Saturday. The dispatcher has been placed on paid administrative leave, Full said. ""You can only imagine how fragile this individual is. This young lady came to work that day ... she had no intentions on ever letting this go."" The woman is being assisted through the county's employee assistance program, he said. Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl said in a statement that, although he has commended the county 911 center many times, Saturday's events ""revealed a flaw in the 911 system."" ""We now know that the 911 dispatcher was made aware that guns were present ... and that this information was not communicated to the officers,"" Ravenstahl said, according to WTAE. ""Before responding to the call, the officers should have had the benefit of knowing that the actor owned firearms. We will never know if Saturday's events would have gone differently had the officers known."" Ravenstahl said he has asked the center's management to develop a plan of action ""to address flaws in the system and to ensure that this type of incident never happens again,"" WTAE reported.","Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle and Paul Sciullo III were shot to death Saturday .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Most of the Supreme Court justices piled up a lot frequent flyer miles in 2007, jetting to such exotic locales as Austria, India and Hawaii, according to financial disclosure reports released Friday. The U.S. Supreme Court justices at a shoot for their 2006 ""class photo."" And they generally have a good bit of spending money for their travels, based on reported investment income. The records, which were released Friday by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, confirm what has been known for some time: that most of the justices are relatively well-off financially. The eight associate justices make $208,100 in annual wages plus income from a variety of resources. Federal judges are not required to publicly release exact income figures, just a general range. The wealthiest justice may be David Souter, with a wise investment he made years ago in a Vermont bank paying off handsomely. His assets in Chittenden Corp. are valued from $5 million to $25 million. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's asset totals are boosted by the fact that her husband, Martin, is a respected private tax attorney in Washington. Justices Stephen Breyer, John Paul Stevens and Antonin Scalia are also millionaires. Justice Samuel Alito, the newest member of the high court, also reported income ranging from $700,000 to $2 million. In the area of reported gifts, Alito cited about $500 in ""Italian food and wine"" given to him by a friend, about whom the justice helpfully noted it ""is not likely that he will appear before this court."" The latest financial records continue to show Justices Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas reporting assets under $1 million, not including homes and judicial salaries. Thomas received a one-time boost to his income when his best-selling memoir was released in October. He received the remaining half of a reported million-dollar book advance and traveled extensively on a book promotion and signing tour. Scalia also received an advance for his book on how to be a better appellate lawyer. The amount was relatively paltry compared to his colleague's: $33,000. The annual records show that Breyer, Ginsburg, Kennedy and Scalia were the busiest travelers. Each made multiple visits overseas to teach, give speeches or attend judicial seminars. Airfare, lodging and meals were generally paid for by the organizations that invited the justices, but under federal law, they must report it. Europe was a favorite destination for several justices. Breyer reported 21 out-of-town trips for which he was reimbursed, including to Paris, France; Rome, Italy; New Delhi, India; and Palm Springs, California. Ginsburg went overseas to France, Belgium, Ireland and Canada and made at least nine other domestic trips. In the same week in July, Kennedy and Chief Justice Roberts were in France and Austria, respectively. But the Most Traveled Award goes to Scalia, who made 33 expense-paid trips, including eight overseas, and visited at least 17 states. Only Souter and Stevens reported no trips for which they were reimbursed by sponsoring groups. Souter also reported no outside teaching gigs, trustee or board memberships, or any gifts received. The 68-year-old bachelor generally spends his extended time away from the high court at his isolated farm in rural New Hampshire. Chief Justice John Roberts may have the most diverse investment portfolio. He recorded 63 investments and trusts, including stock in Time Warner (parent company of CNN), Citicorp, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard. The estimated value is from about $2.4 million to more than $6 million. Before becoming a federal judge, Roberts was a high-paid Washington lawyer. His judicial salary is $217,400. Roberts, 53, continued to sell off small amounts of common stock, including in Cisco and Citigroup. When he took over as chief justice in 2005, he was forced to sell stock in several companies. A bill passed two years ago in Congress allows federal judges to defer paying capital gains taxes on securities they sell to avoid conflicts of interest. High-level executive branch employees had enjoyed that privilege for years. The issue of judges holding such diverse investment portfolios has resulted in several conflicts of interest, prompting calls for reform. The high court last month refused to accept an appeal from a group of South Africans seeking to sue U.S. and foreign firms for allegedly helping keep the white-led apartheid government of their country in power for decades. Four members of the high court were forced to remove themselves from consideration of the cases. No reason was given for their recusal, but financial disclosure reports showed that Roberts, along with Breyer and Alito, owns stock in several of the companies being sued. Kennedy's son Gregory is a top manager in one, investment bank Credit Suisse. Under federal rules, at least six justices must hear a case that is accepted for review. With four of the nine recused, the high court had no choice but to uphold the lower court ruling, tossing out the lawsuit. Some reform advocates say that judges should be allowed to own only mutual funds instead of individual stocks. Mutual funds involve a range of investments whose identities are disclosed to the fund's shareholders several times each year. Federal law allows judges to own mutual funds without having to recuse themselves from a particular appeal.","Reports show David Souter may be the wealthiest member of Supreme Court .

He could work for Greater Boston Legal Services, a legal aid group serving people living in poverty. The firm agreed to pay Dineen about a quarter of his former salary for a year. Dineen, who needed to support his wife and a newborn daughter, accepted. ""This gave me a chance to do something different with my legal career, and help out people who generally don't  have access to public service,"" said Dineen, who now works on foreclosure cases helping victims of predatory lending. Foley Hoag is among many megafirms across the country using the economic slump as an ideal time to lend a hand to cash-strapped public interest and legal aid firms. The massive corporate layoffs and program cuts could redirect thousands of young graduates and experienced attorneys from corporate firms into the public sector, legal experts say. Once insulated, law firms are shedding young and mid-career associates at extraordinary rates. This is especially true at large corporate firms that overestimated their growth and extended too many offers to associates last fall. White & Case LLP, a leading global firm with headquartes in New York, made a second round of cuts last week. In addition to about 70 associates laid off in November, the firm last week let go of another 400 people, including 200 attorneys. Other well-known firms such as Heller Ehrman LLP and Thelen Reid & Priest LLP on the West Coast have gone bankrupt in recent months. At least 2,149 attorneys have been laid off in 2009, bringing the total to 3,045 since January of last year, according to Lawshucks.com, an industry Web site tracking the slump. Hundreds more associates set to start jobs this fall are bracing themselves for rescinded offers and deferred start dates. Some students are finding their summers wide open as law firms like Luce Forward, based in California, have canceled internship programs. Amid all this dark news, there might be a silver lining. It could transform the legal profession. ""There is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity coming out of a difficult situation,"" said Esther Lardent, president of the Pro Bono Institute in Washington, who began discussions this month with at least 15 corporate firms nationwide about placing unemployed attorneys in public interest firms. The project will get under way in a few months, she said. Other firms have already encouraged attorneys to go into the public sector. Just last week,  one of the largest firms in the country -- Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania -- announced it will pay deferred associates graduating in 2009 a $5,000 monthly stipend for one year if they secure a job in the public interest field. International law giants Latham & Watkins LLP and Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP offered incoming associates who defer employement until October 2010 a $75,000 compensation package. While working in public service isn't mandatory for Latham & Watkins associates, the firm said there was a ""sincere hope"" the deferred associates would ""use the intervening period to pursue a community service or other public advocacy projects of their choosing."" Such deferral plans can save the companies about $100,000 per associate, and law experts expect the list of firms enacting deferral programs to grow geometrically as the economy worsens. ""Firms are doing this to be flexible and regulate their labor force because there just isn't as much work anymore,"" said James G. Leipold, executive director of the National Association for Law Placement. Corporate giants are also scrambling to find work for mid-level attorneys in the public sector. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, a major New York-based law firm, introduced a yearlong public service fellowship program this year that would pay current attorneys $60,000 a year to work in areas such as social service, community development or academia. The company hopes the program will alleviate ""significant budgetary constraints."" ""You aren't just throwing somebody out there,"" said American Bar Association President Tommy Wells, who requested funding in President Obama's stimulus package to help pay attorneys to work in the public sector. (The proposal was rejected.) ""You're meeting a real need in these tough times where you have more of a legal need and fewer resources,"" Wells said. Encouraging laid-off and deferred attorneys to go into public service is filling a desperate need at public interest firms. Public interest and legal aid firms serving the underprivileged have long been under-funded and overwhelmed with cases even in a good economy. Tightened state budgets and a decline in donations have further stretched resources for the public interest firms, forcing them to make staff cuts at a time when demand for their services is greater than ever before. At Greater Boston Legal Services, the public interest firm where Dineen arrived in January, the effects of a sick economy are apparent. Robert Sable, the public interest firm's executive director, has already reduced staff. The agency, which handles 15,000 matters a year, expects to make more staff reductions in the coming months because of a $2 million funding shortfall. ""We're burning through our reserves right now, so it's nice to have extra help,"" said Sable, who is talking to another local corporate firm this week about taking in subsidized attorneys. Some attorneys and law students worry that paying corporate attorneys to work in public interest firms may displace those who actually wanted to work in the public sector in the first place. Jocelyn E. Getgen, who works with students at Cornell Law School, said strained legal aid organizations and nonprofits will want to take in the ""free"" labor. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that the economic free-fall is changing the ways current attorneys -- and a new generation of young attorneys -- view the field. Traditionally, law students have equated best jobs with highest-paying jobs, career counselors say. Students saddled with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt find themselves pressured to work at large firms that will pay enough to cover the bills, said Tricia McGrath, a director at Lateral Link Group LLC, a job placement agency for lawyers. Many times, going into the public sector isn't even an option, she said. ""Everyone has to rethink all the old models that we believed in, the model where you go to school and then a big firm,"" said McGrath, who graduated from Fordham University School of Law in 1998, a time when law jobs were abundant. iReport.com: Cutting back with brown-bag lunches? Show us on video . Even students at top law schools are finding that their offers have been rescinded. At Harvard Law School, Mark Weber, assistant dean for career services, said he has been working with a handful of students whose job offers have been deferred. ""It can be a tremendous opportunity for the student to take that year and try something entirely different,"" Weber said. ""Hopefully within a year, the economic picture will do better."" After not receiving a corporate firm job offer in the downtrodden industry, Scott Greenwood, set to graduate this spring from the University of Southern California's Gould School of Law, will instead work for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. ""I can see what it's like to work for a regulatory agency, and that's a different expertise that attorneys don't always get to have,"" said Greenwood, who will begin working in Washington in August. ""I've been thinking about it as a blessing in disguise.""","At least 2,149 attorneys have been laid off in 2009, according to Lawshucks.com .

"(CNN) -- A 27-year-old woman from eastern China has died of bird flu, Chinese authorities said, making her the second person to die this year from the deadly virus. Human-to-human transmission of avian flu is rare, but in some cases, the virus has passed from poultry to humans. The woman fell ill on January 5 in Shandong province on the country's east coast and died on Saturday, the Ministry of Health said in a statement. Two tests on the woman were positive for H5N1 avian influenza, said the ministry, which did not say how she might have contracted the virus. On Saturday, the World Health Organization said a 2-year-old girl in northern China had tested positive for bird flu -- now the country's third confirmed case of the virus this month. The girl fell ill on January 7 in central Hunan province and was taken to her home province of Shanxi in northern China, the state-run news agency Xinhua said. The report did not say how she became infected. On January 5, a 19-year-old Beijing woman died of bird flu after handling poultry, officials said. Xinhua said the woman bought nine ducks at a market in Beijing's neighboring Hebei province and cleaned their organs before falling ill. Since the end of 2003, the H5N1 virus has infected numerous species of birds in more than 60 countries in Asia, Europe and Africa. It has not been found in birds in North or South America or the Caribbean, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Human-to-human transmission of avian flu is rare, but in some cases the virus has passed from poultry to humans. It has killed more than 200 people since 2003. China reported its first human-to-human infection case in 2005. So far, 30 cases have been confirmed. Twenty of them have been fatal, according to Xinhua.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The worst snowstorm to hit Britain in 18 years forced the cancellation of more than 650 flights at London's Heathrow airport Monday and shut down the city's bus network, partially paralyzing the British capital. A group of men push a giant snowball across Kensington Gardens, west London Monday. Heathrow, one of the busiest transport hubs in the world, closed both its runways for more than two hours Monday morning and operated with just one for the rest of the morning, according to BAA, the company which runs it.

""Londoners of all ages are childishly happy to be making snowmen and having snowball fights. Bankers of all ages are throwing snowballs in the middle of the residential streets,"" Monica Majumdar told CNN in an iReport. She lived in New York before moving to London four years ago, and was surprised by how little snow it took to bring the British capital to a standstill. ""I have seen snow like this. But somehow, it's more beautiful here. It's partly due to the fact that even Londoners are amazed by the snow -- so there is a general air of surrealism,"" she said via e-mail. "" I do feel like I'm in a Christmas snowglobe, with all the iconic London monuments blanketed by the powdered snow."" London's famous red buses were pulled off the roads on Sunday night as the snow got deeper. It was the first time ""in living memory"" that all city bus service had been suspended, including when London was being bombed during World War II, a spokesman for the city's transit agency, Transport for London, said. ""Bus services were suspended throughout London last night on the grounds of passenger safety due to the unsafe road conditions resulting in a large number of traffic incidents across London,"" the agency said in a statement Monday morning.

"(CNN)  -- Two former presidents reflected on their greatest regrets in office Monday, each looking back to issues that continue to plague the nation years later. Former presidents and political rivals Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush now share philanthropic efforts. Former Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton appeared together at a question-and-answer forum before the National Automobile Dealers Association in New Orleans, Louisiana. Asked his biggest regret after leaving office, Bush said he now wonders whether he should have tried to get Saddam Hussein to leave office at the end of the first Gulf War in 1991. He told the gathering, ""I've thought a lot about it, but at the end of Desert Storm, the question was should we have kind of kept going on that road to death and all this slaughter until Saddam Hussein showed up and laid his sword on the table, surrendered. And the common wisdom was he wouldn't do that."" But he said a conversation with an FBI agent who interrogated Saddam after he was captured has made him reconsider. Bush recalled their talk, ""I said, 'What if we just say he has to come to surrender, would he have done it?' And this guy said, 'I'm absolutely convinced he would have.' My experts tell me he wouldn't have."" Bush said, ""We ended it the way we said we would"" as a military success, but noted a cleaner ending ""would have been perfect."" He added, ""If we had tried to get Saddam Hussein to come and literally surrender and put his sword on the table, I think it might have been avoided some of the problems that we did have in the future from him."" On a day that President Barack Obama dispatched George Mitchell to the Middle East as the latest U.S. envoy, Clinton discussed the failure to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians. ""My No. 1 regret is that I was not able to persuade Yasser Arafat to accept the peace plan I offered at the end of my presidency that the Israelis accepted. ""If he had done that ... we had had seven years of progress toward peace. We had one year in 1998, the only year in the history of Israel where not a single soul was killed in a terrorist act. The Palestinians had more control over West Bank then than they do today,"" Clinton said. ""And if he had taken that deal, we would have a Palestinian state and we would have had, I think now, normal peaceful relations with Israel and all of its Arab neighbors."" Clinton said a deal would have helped the U.S. handle other issues in the region, saying, ""We'd be much better positioned to deal with the problem of Iran, and we would have taken away about half the arguments of terrorists around the world by giving the Palestinians their state and creating a cooperative, positive interdependence in the Middle East, not a negative one. And so, I think that would have done more good to save more lives and help more people, and I wish I had been able to do that. "" Clinton also said he regretted not doing more to ""stop the Rwandan genocide,"" and succeeding on a new health care plan. He said ""presidents should share freely ... the mistakes they made"" with historians, because it teaches lessons. He said he shared problems during the lunch with Obama and the four living presidents, saying, ""You want each new president to make new mistakes, not the same ones."" Clinton added, ""all of us know if you make enough decisions, you're going to make a few of them aren't right.""","Middle East leaves George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton with some regrets .

"NEW DELHI (CNN) -- Suraj Suroj uses his motorcycle for all of his family's transportation needs. In his case, that means transporting himself, his wife and his two sons to and from work and school. Typically, all four of them squeeze onto the motorbike together on the crowded streets of Delhi, India. Suraj Suroj and his two sons weave through the streets of Delhi on his motorcycle. ""We need more space,"" Suroj says with one of his sons sitting in front of him and the other clinging to his back. ""We can only travel about 20 kilometers or 25 kilometers, after that we get tired traveling on the scooter."" Never mind the fact that it's a very dangerous way to travel. The traffic is chaotic, constant, and congested and neither of Suroj's sons have helmets. Millions of people travel this way in India because helmet laws are not enforced and a two wheeler is the best they can afford. Not any more. Monday, Tata Motors finally released what has become known as the ""world's cheapest car."" With the basic model going for about $2,000, the Tata Nano is being touted as an alternative to motorbikes and scooters. In dramatic fashion, three versions of the Nano were driven onto a dark stage with headlights flashing and invited guests clapping in Mumbai, India. Tata Motors says the Nano will be available for purchase on April 9 but won't be delivered to customers until July.   Watch as Nano is unveiled » . The vehicle has received international attention since it was first revealed in January 2008 at an Auto Expo in Delhi. Tata promised it at an incredibly low price. As the economy began to falter last year and the cost of materials started to rise, analysts began to doubt whether Tata could pull it off. Chairman of Tata group, Ratan Tata, answered those critics at the launch. ""We made a promise and we've kept the promise. We hope this day we will usher in a new form of transport,"" Tata said. But the launch of the Nano is months behind schedule. The company ran into trouble when a land dispute sparked angry protests over the building of the Nano plant in the communist stronghold state of West Bengal. Farmers said the land belonged to them. In the end, Ratan Tata decided to stop operations and move to another state which caused a delay and cost Tata Motors millions. But the Nano has finally arrived. Industry experts say the base model is really basic but looks modern, is surprisingly spacious and handles well. ""I think it will live up to what has been promised but it will not live up to what some people may imagine,"" auto analyst Murad Baig said. ""If some people may imagine that this is going to be a golden chariot, no it won't. But it will be an economical, safe, practical, economical to buy, economical to run and a very cute little car, I must say."" At only three meters long, the Nano fits four adults relatively comfortably. Critics point out that the cheapest version of the vehicle comes without air conditioning, airbags or power windows and it only has one side-view mirror. The Nano's speeds top out at 105 kilometers (65 miles) per hour. Tata says the Nano, which meets Indian environmental standards, has the lowest emissions among cars in its class. But environmentalists are not cheering its arrival. They are worried the Nano will simply add to the number of vehicles already choking the roads. ""We are not saying no to Nano. We are saying no to all cars,"" said Amanita Roychowdry, a representative of India's Center for Science and Environment. ""What is happening right now is that already when car numbers are exploding in Indian cities what cheap motorization is going to do is going to give that extra push. And that is what worries us. Anything that increases the number of cars on our roads is a bad news."" No one knows, however, if the Nano will increase numbers or simply replace other cars in its class. For now, the Nano sounds like a fantastic alternative for those families in India who are trying to navigate crowded streets while crammed together on a motorcycle. ""We will definitely be able travel farther with a Nano,"" motorcycle driver Suraj Suroj said. ""Why not? We will be able travel comfortably. There will also be more safety.""","Tata Motors to begin delivery of the Nano in July .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- CIA vs. DNI -- the clash of the titans. Dennis Blair, left, was picked to be director of national intelligence and Leon Panetta to head the CIA. In the old world, the CIA director ruled. He not only ran the spy agency, but he wore a second hat as director of Central Intelligence. The DCI was ostensibly responsible for coordinating the activities of all 16 agencies and departments which make up the intelligence community. Then came along the DNI (Director of National Intelligence) in 2005 --  a product of intelligence reform following the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Those intelligence failures were proof that you needed one person to focus exclusively on guiding the community. Running the CIA in itself was a full-time job. The DNI would oversee the entire intelligence community while the CIA director concentrated on running the spy agency. But there's a problem with this setup. Although the DNI was given more input into budgets and personnel than the DCI had, the DNI's powers are limited and somewhat vague. The intelligence chief has a say in lots of things, but there's no real muscle behind his decisions. It's not like the defense secretary, who has absolute authority over all department components. Outgoing CIA Director Mike Hayden recently told reporters there is natural tension between the CIA and DNI, but it's ""not a bad structure."" He did suggest, however, that the DNI's office was getting a bit bloated. ""Americans being Americans, they're going to fill up their day trying to doing something impactful,"" he said, ""which means between the two of us there's going to be a trench line ... out there."" And how did departing DNI Mike McConnell respond to Hayden's quip? ""Anytime you have organizations that have similar interests, you're going to have disputes,"" he said. ""And particularly if the two leaders aren't working together and having a partnership and so on, the warfare at the trench level gets to be pretty much a raging battle."" McConnell said he had a good professional relationship with Hayden, so they made it work. But he added, ""we don't have a department of intelligence. If this were the Department of Defense, there wouldn't be any question, but it isn't."" CIA nominee Leon Panetta got into the middle of the dispute during his confirmation hearing. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, wanted to know Panetta's understanding of the relationship between the CIA and the DNI. Would he be under the supervision of the DNI? Initially, Panetta said he reported to the DNI and performed the tasks assigned to him by the DNI, but then he added: ""we are an operational arm, just like the [National Security Agency], just like the [National Reconnaissance Office], and I believe the role of the DNI is to coordinate all our activities..."" Well, the NSA and the NRO are part of the Defense Department and report directly to the Defense Secretary, not the DNI. The CIA is the only intelligence agency that is not part of another department. A bit baffled by Panetta's response, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, asked him point blank, ""Is the DNI your boss or not?"" Panetta's answer, ""The DNI is my boss."" It makes you wonder how Panetta and the other new guy -- DNI Dennis Blair -- will play in the sand box.","DNI oversees entire intelligence community; CIA director concentrates on spy agency .

"(CNN) -- A former mayor of a city in southeast Wisconsin pleaded innocent Tuesday to charges of child pornography, solicitation of a minor and related counts, a prosecutor said. Gary Becker, former mayor of Racine, Wisconsin, is charged with soliciting someone he believed was a girl. Former Racine Mayor Gary Becker, who was arraigned Tuesday, could face a sentence of up to 164 years if convicted on all counts, District Attorney Michael Nieskes told CNN. He was still in office when he was arrested last month at a shopping mall in Brookfield, Wisconsin. He allegedly tried to meet with a person he thought was a 14-year-old girl after chatting with that person online, said Bill Kosh, a spokesman for the Wisconsin attorney general's office. An officer posed online as the underage girl, according to authorities. Becker's attorney did not immediately return calls for comment. Authorities first launched an investigation after Becker brought his personal computer into the mayor's office for repair. The computer technician hired by his office discovered six pornographic images of girls ""possibly under the age of 18 years,"" according to Wisconsin criminal complaint. The technician reported his findings to local law enforcement officers, and they turned the case over to the state's child Internet crimes task force. Members of the task force swapped out the computer's hard drive so they could investigate without alerting Becker, Nieskes said. Their search uncovered further pornographic images of underage girls and more than 1,800 online chats containing ""sexually explicit comments,"" some of them directed at underage girls, the complaint says. Authorities then set up an online profile for the fictitious 14-year-old girl -- using the name ""Hopeyoulikeme14"" -- and engaged the mayor in a chat that lasted more than two hours, the complaint says. During the chat, the former mayor agreed to meet the girl at a shopping mall, the document says. Becker, who resigned from office after his arrest, faces six criminal counts: child enticement, possession of child pornography, exposing a child to harmful materials, attempted second-degree sexual assault of a child, use of a computer to facilitate a child sex crime and misconduct in public office, according to a January statement from the Wisconsin Department of Justice.","NEW: A former mayor of Racine, Wisconsin, arraigned Tuesday .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- She survived a bloodbath at a Lane Bryant store in Tinley Park, Illinois, by playing dead. The only survivor, she gave police a detailed description of the gunman. The Illinois State police worked closely with the survivor to come up with a composite of the gunman. Police aren't identifying their witness to protect her safety. Five other women lost their lives at Lane Bryant on February 2, 2008. The gunman is still at large. The crime began to unfold shortly after 10 a.m. when a man posing as a delivery man walked into the store. He chatted briefly with two customers and two employees. Then, police said, he pulled out a gun and announced a holdup. He forced the four women into the back room, police said. He bound them with duct tape and placed them face down on the floor. Two more women who later entered the store also were taken to the back room, tied and placed next to the others.  Watch an update on the case » . Store manager Rhoda McFarland managed to call 911 from her cell phone at 10:44 a.m., just before she was shot to death. She got to her phone while the gunman was distracted, even though she was bound by the duct tape. On the call, posted on the Tinley Park police Web site, a man can be heard saying, ""I'm losing it."" The six women were shot execution style. Five of them were dead by the time police arrived, a few minutes after McFarland's call. A sixth woman survived. She, too, had been shot and left for dead, but tricked the killer by pretending to be dead. The killer was not wearing a mask or disguise, so she was able to describe him in detail. She told police he was a 6 foot African-American male, average weight, medium to dark skin tone, with braided hair and cornrows, husky build, and between 25 and 35 years old. His hair was pulled back, but one braid hung along his right cheek with light-green beads at the end of it, she told police. Police have released a composite sketch based on the witness' description. Besides store manager McFarland, the other women slain were Jennifer Bishop, Connie Woolfolk, Carrie Hudek Chiuso and Sarah Szafranski. The investigation remains open and active, and all theories are still being investigated, police say. The investigation has included a thorough vetting of the victims' backgrounds to determine whether any of them had any enemies. ""None of the victimology so far has led to any suspects yet,"" said Commander Pat McCain of the Tinley Park Police Department. Police aren't ruling out any theories, including robbery. The gunman took a few hundred dollars, police said. ""Certainly, the surviving witness didn't seem to recognize the killer, but maybe one of the dead victims knew him. We don't know,"" McCain said. The weapon used was a .40-caliber Glock. Bullet casings were left at the scene and the killer took the weapon with him. More than a year later, forensics from the crime scene are still being processed, police said. Investigators won't comment on whether the gunman left any fingerprints, hair or other trace evidence. Police say they have received more than 5,000 tips and feel this case will be solved. But at this point, they have not named a person of interest or a suspect. Investigators are asking for the public's help. There is a $100,000 reward for the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the Lane Bryant shootings. Have information?

"SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNET) -- The fact that you now can explore the ocean through Google Earth isn't going to make Google much money directly. But the move is nonetheless smart. The new Google Earth 5.0 software allows users to explore the ocean depths from their computers. Google generated early-stage goodwill from being the best answer to the online search problem. But the company is large and getting larger, especially as it shows a better ability to withstand the recession than rivals, and that goodwill won't last forever. Google Earth, though, gives the company a new way to bring its brand to the world, notably with students for whom the software will help supplant atlases and encyclopedias. And in the long run, as Google Earth and Maps -- either as standalone software or used through a browser -- will likely become a widely used virtual window on the real world. Google will control the technology and commercialization of that portal. Will the visibility of the ocean depths on Google Earth make money directly? Not likely. But it adds incrementally to the overall utility of the software, which in the long run keeps it relevant. ""The near-term opportunity is in local search,"" for example people looking for restaurants or hotels, said John Hanke, director of Google Earth and Maps, in an interview. Google has begun experimenting with advertisements on Google Maps and Google Earth, added Peter Birch, product manager of Google Earth, at the launch event. Since people often need to discover information about a place before going there, Google Earth and Maps could prove a lucrative endeavor. It may take years to get there, and it'll cost Google dearly in server hardware and network bandwidth, but Google has shown patience in subsidizing long-term projects. Though Hanke wouldn't reveal the expense of Google's geographic services, some of the economics are in the company's favor. Just as Google's search engine takes advantage of innumerable information that others put on the Internet, Google Earth is a platform that houses information supplied by outsiders that Google doesn't have to pay. It's the Internet's user-generated content story, but this time it's data that can be overlaid on a map of the Earth. And in the case of the ocean work, there are prestigious users generating high-quality content. Many ocean researchers gathered at the Google Earth 5.0 launch, and several showed there's pent-up demand for a way to conveniently display their data somewhere. And it's not just to share sea surface temperature data with fellow Ph.D.s, but also to try to educate the public. Ken Peterson, communications director for the Monterey Bay Aquarium, was excited about his layer in Google Earth that shows the location of various types of fish -- along with ratings for people about whether they should eat those varieties or substitute others. Barbara Block of Stanford University and Patrick Halpin of Duke University were eager to show the tracks of shark travels recorded by radio transmission to satellites. Ross Swick of the University of Colorado-Boulder showed a Google Earth animation of the gradually shrinking Arctic ice cap over the last 29 years. And Philip Renaud of the Living Oceans Foundation has supplied underwater video of the Red Sea as part of the foundation's mission to chronicle the state of coral reefs. Hanke envisions much broader information, though, including consumer-oriented material such as the best dive spots and kite-surfing areas. Ultimately, he wants ""every single location"" on Earth, land or sea, to have information. ""We're trying to encourage our users to annotate all the places in the world. Part of what we're doing is seeding that ecosystem of spatial information,"" Hanke said. ""That creates an opportunity for Google to provide location services on phones, mobile devices, in cars in the future, to guide people to the best places. Being a valued guide, the go-to source of information about the best places to go -- that will be a powerful and valuable thing for Google."" Think of it as a second Internet in a way, only instead of using abstract names to locate information, you can use actual locations to locate information. Some refer to the idea as the ""geographic Web."" The clearest illustration of the indirect benefits Google Earth can bring is the fact that the company could persuade former Vice President Al Gore, whose climate change documentary won him an Oscar and a Nobel Peace Prize, to bear the Google Earth standard. In effect, he provided an eco-halo that can offset the more down-to-earth capitalistic realities of Google's operation. Google seems to share the altruistic, educational motivations of many researchers. But it's also got business in mind with Google Earth. ""We try to create products people love to use,"" Birch said. ""We create value, then think of appropriate ways of monetization."" © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The FBI has hit a dead end in its search for a missing 3-year-old Arkansas boy and is asking the public for help. The FBI is hoping the public can help find 3-year-old Dominick Wesley Arceneaux. Dominick Wesley Arceneaux was last seen by an aunt Tuesday afternoon in the front yard of a mobile home in Chidester, in south-central Arkansas, authorities said. In a missing-person alert, the FBI described Dominick as 3 feet tall, weighing 38 pounds, with brown hair and eyes. Kimberly Brunell, a special agent with the FBI in Little Rock, said authorities have made ""an exhaustive search"" of White Oak Lake, close to where the boy was last seen. National Guardsmen have also done a grid search covering a one-mile radius around the home, she said, and are currently expanding it to a two-mile radius. Investigators also have looked at registered sex offenders in the area, Brunell said. They have also found Dominick's father, who lives in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. ""We have not ruled anyone out at this point,"" she said. The investigation has included looking at patrons of a bar next to the mobile home where Dominick has lived with his mother since December, she said. ""There is not the normal traffic of just neighbors."" Brunell said investigators have run down every lead and are looking for new ones, including ""suspicious vehicles, suspicious persons ... anyone who might have a nugget that might lead us on our way to finding out what happened to him.""

"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN -- Military officials in Sri Lanka said they shot down a Tamil Tiger aircraft near the Colombo International Airport on Friday, in an air engagement with rebels that killed two people and left about 50 wounded. An injured survivor of a suicide attack in northeast Sri Lanka on February 9 . Sri Lankan officials claimed both planes were shot down by the Sri Lankan Air Force, SLAF, refuting the Tiger's claim they were conducting suicide missions in the country's capital. A spokesperson for the Sri Lankan Military said the body of a Tamil Tiger guerrilla was found by the plane's wreckage after it was shot down near the Colombo International Airport. The other plane, which entered the capital of Colombo, dropped a bomb but crashed into the offices of the Department of Inland Revenue, two blocks away from Air Force Headquarters, a military spokesman said. According to the Sri Lanka's Lankapuvath news agency, the country's air defense was activated at 9:30 p.m.( 11 a.m. ET) Friday after receiving information that two of the rebels light aircrafts were circulating over Colombo. ""Both aircrafts were brought down by air force firing,"" Lankapuvath reported. ""The dead body of the LTTE pilot was also found strewn about."" The news agency said 50 people were admitted to Colombo General Hospital due to injuries from the crash. Two died from their wounds. According to the pro-Tamil Tiger Web site Tamil.net.com, two Black Air Tiger Pilots -- the group's elite squadron --died after carrying out diving missions into Sri Lanka's air force headquarters in Colombo and an air force base in Katunayaka.   CNN could not independently verify the claims made by the rebels or the government. In a report released on Thursday, Human Rights Watch criticized the Sri Lankan government for its ""indiscriminate"" killings of civilian as it attempts to fight the rebel movement. As the rebel stronghold continues to shrink, civilians are trapped in the cross-fire, HRW said. ""Sri Lankan forces are shelling hospitals and so-called safe zones and slaughtering the civilians there,"" James Ross, legal and policy director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. HRW also condemned the Tamil Tigers for its treatment of civilians. The organization's 45-page study said 2,000 civilians have been killed and another 5,000 have been wounded. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- commonly known as the Tamil Tigers -- have fought for an independent homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority since 1983. The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead.","NEW: Officials claim air force shot down rebel planes .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The latest 3-D animated movie involves the possible extinction of the human race and features a mad scientist with the head of a cockroach, a prehistoric half-ape/half-fish, a 50-foot-tall woman (OK, 49-foot-11), and a blue brainless blob named B.O.B. The Missing Link, Ginormica, the blue blob B.O.B. and Insectosaurus dominate ""Monsters vs. Aliens."" And they're the good guys. Reese Witherspoon leads the cast of ""Monsters vs. Aliens,"" providing the voice of Susan, who is hit by a glowing meteorite on her wedding day. Before long she's grown into the biggest thing around. The short-statured Oscar winner relished the chance to play not only a giant, but also a role model. ""I was walking with my son and my daughter the other day, and I was like 'Who's your favorite superhero?' "" Witherspoon said. ""And my son was like ... 'Batman, Superman, Spiderman,' and he could name 20 guy superheroes. ""And so I said to my daughter, 'Who's your favorite superhero?' And she goes 'I don't know, the girl in the back of the Justice League? I can't remember her name.' "" So the idea of showcasing a female superhero, Witherspoon said, has the actress ""really excited."" Kiefer Sutherland, who plays General W.R. Monger, sees the film as helping kids embrace their diversity. ""I love the idea that they were gonna make a film that was going to tell young people that it's all right to be different,"" Sutherland said. His military veteran character captures Susan, renames her ""Ginormica,"" and locks her up with the other ""monsters"" he's collected over half a century. ""And not only is it all right to be different, that one thing that may make you feel awkward about being different might be your greatest asset."" Those assets become apparent when an alien invader (voiced by Rainn Wilson of ""The Office"") decides he wants Earth, and the monsters -- Ginormica, Dr. Cockroach (""House"" star Hugh Laurie), The Missing Link (Will Arnett), and the gelatinous B.O.B. (Seth Rogen) -- are called upon to save the planet. The film, which also features the voices of Stephen Colbert and Paul Rudd, opens Friday. Most of the cast had previous experience in animation voiceover -- last year, Rogen was featured in ""Kung Fu Panda,"" and he and Arnett were heard in ""Horton Hears A Who!"" -- but it was the first time for Wilson. ""They called me and they said 'They're interested in you for this, playing an evil alien warlord,' and I was like 'Where do I sign?' "" he said with a chuckle. It was a welcome change of pace for Sutherland, who recorded his voice tracks for ""Monsters"" while he was filming the uber-intense ""24."" ""So, for five days a week I'm very serious in the '24' world, and then for five hours on the weekend I got to be 5 years old and just play a cartoon character"" -- a character he says he saw as a combination of R. Lee Ermey's intense gunnery sergeant in ""Full Metal Jacket"" and that 'toon terror, Yosemite Sam. ""We combined these voices and the producers laughed, which is generally a pretty good sign,"" Sutherland said. Sutherland may have been inspired by the classics, but the 3-D aspect of ""Monsters"" is as modern as movie technology gets. Under the command of DreamWorks Animation chief Jeffrey Katzenberg (whom Witherspoon and Sutherland respectfully called ""Mr. Katzenberg""), the film was conceived from the beginning as a 3-D project. One early scene uses the process to bounce a paddleball out at the audience, but for the most part, the effect is used immersively, to bring viewers into the ""Monsters"" world. ""You really feel like you're there, like you're a part of this thing,"" said Arnett, ""not in a way that's gratuitous and to just sort of show off, but really so that the viewer can be an active participant in the movie."" While film technology continues to advance, some things never change. As Susan is still trying to get used to her new size and powers, she finds herself simultaneously battling an alien robot and trying to save dozens of people trapped in their cars on the Golden Gate Bridge while her male cohorts mostly just stand around. One tries to encourage her by calling ""You're doing it!"" to which Susan snaps back, ""I'm doing everything!"" ""The quintessential cry!"" Witherspoon said. ""The female war cry! That's one of my favorite lines."" iReport.com: Does 3-D make you more likely to see a movie? Of course, it's hardly a spoiler to reveal that -- eventually -- Susan not only bonds with the rest of her motley crew, but also gains the self-confidence to see the positives in her accidental enormousness. As Wilson, the film's villain, noted, ""It's a coming-of-age tale -- for the monster inside of each one of us."" And, perhaps, it will give some little girls a superhero to look up to.","""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is about motley group of misfits who team up to defeat alien .

"(CNN) -- Staffers at a federal prison in central Florida fired shots to break up a large-scale fight that sent eight inmates to hospital emergency rooms Sunday afternoon, officials said. Eight inmates were injured Sunday in a fight at Coleman Federal Correctional Complex in Florida, officials said. Authorities did not say what led to the fight at the Coleman Federal Correctional Complex in Sumter County. A statement from the prison said one inmate suffered a gunshot wound, but did not say whether the person was struck by a prison staff member's bullet. The other seven were ""stabbing/shooting victims,"" said a spokesman for Orlando Regional Medical Center, where the inmates were taken. The hospital did not elaborate. No prison staffers were seriously hurt in the incident, which the FBI is investigating, said Charles Ratledge, spokesman for the prison. The fight broke out in the recreation yard of the United States Penitentiary No. 2, a high-security facility, about 2:20 p.m. The Coleman complex consists of four institutions. The other three facilities -- another U.S. penitentiary, a medium-security and a low-security facility -- were not affected, said Bureau of Prison spokeswoman Traci Billingsley. ""The inmates ignored staff orders to stop their assaultive behavior, and shots were fired by institution staff to prevent possible loss of life,"" Ratledge said. Five medical evacuation helicopters -- three from the hospital -- landed at the prison and transported the injured inmates on the 15- to 20-minute flight to Orlando Regional, hospital spokesman Joe Brown said. The prison complex is in near Coleman in Sumter County, about 50 miles northwest of Orlando, Florida.

"(CNN) -- CNN's Larry King talked with former President Bill Clinton on Tuesday night at the William Jefferson Clinton Center in Little Rock, Arkansas. Bill Clinton talked politics and more with CNN's Larry King on Tuesday night. In a wide-ranging interview, King talked with Clinton about the stimulus bill, the auto bailout, President Barack Obama's BlackBerry, Chelsea Clinton's future, Sarah Palin and more. The following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Larry King: The stimulus bill passed today [Tuesday]. The president signed it in Denver. Is it going to work? Bill Clinton:  I think it will do what it's designed to do. And I think it's important that the American people understand what it's designed to do. It's supposed to do three things. Number one, put money in people's pockets who are in trouble now -- extended unemployment benefits, the modest tax cuts, increase in food stamps. That will help grocery stores and other businesses and keep Americans who are good, honest, hardworking people afloat.  Watch Larry King's interview with Bill Clinton » . The second thing it's supposed to do is give a chunk of money to state and local governments, primarily for education and health. That is designed to make sure that they don't have to either have big tax increases or lay a million people off. Either one, in this economy, would be bad. The third thing it will do is to create jobs through existing road and bridge contracts, through rail improvements, through modernization and especially through clean energy and energy efficiency. So I think that given how fast it had to be done and the compromises that had to be made, it's quite a good bill. And I think it will do what it's designed to do. King: John McCain and others on the other side of the ledger are saying that he didn't come forward enough to the Republicans, he didn't make them part of this Easter basket. Clinton: Well, I disagree with that. I think the only way he could have gotten a lot of them to vote for him would be to accept their economic theory. Their economic theory is why we're in this mess in the first place. King: Do you resent it when the Bush people say that this problem started with you, it started in your administration? Clinton: Well, they don't have much evidence for that. I always answer, does anyone seriously believe if the team I had in place had been in place for the last eight years that this would have happened? And the answer to that is no. We had a much more vigorous regulatory environment with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We were watching these derivatives. I do think we should have done more on derivatives. King: Before we move on to other things, should taxpayers be bailing out the automakers? Clinton: We don't owe it to them. We should only do it if it's in our interests. I believe it's in our interests ... King: We keep hearing about Obama's BlackBerry -- he's got a special BlackBerry now that doesn't have to be recorded into the White House. Do you have the number? Clinton: No. No. King: Would you like the number? Clinton: I know that in the world that exists today, if you're hyper-busy, you need them. Hillary lives on hers. King: Do you have one? Clinton:  I don't. I like being able to concentrate on what I'm doing one thing at a time, you know. And I think if I had one, I'm so hyper and always trying to do three things at once, I'd be worse than he is or worse than she is. So I don't have one. King: What's Chelsea going to be? Is she interested in government? Clinton: Yes, she's interested in government. She cares about public health. She thinks that America has still got a ways to go to develop an affordable, high quality health care system. And I think she wants to be a part of it. King: Sarah Palin, net plus, net gain? Clinton: I think she was a net plus before the failure of Lehman Brothers and the collapse of the stock market, because she gave (McCain) credibility on the Republican right. Through no fault of her own, she became a negative on September 15th, because nobody on their team had any economic experience, and the burden against the Republicans was overwhelming. King: What do you make of President Obama? I mean, for a while I know that you were down and dirty tough when Hillary was running. And that was a pretty rough campaign, a very close campaign. What do you make of him now? Clinton: Well, I always had a great respect for his abilities. Those have been confirmed by the way he's conducted himself in the transition and in these early weeks. I think he is very smart. And I think he wants right things for America. And I think he's made good people decisions and good policy decisions. King: Can he try to live like a normal person -- going home to Chicago, kids go to school, he helps take them to school, plays basketball, goes out to public restaurants? Can you keep that up? Clinton: I think so.  I did quite a bit of it and I wish I had done even more. King: What would you recommend or say or advise George W. Bush about being a former president? There aren't many of you. Clinton: Well, first I would advise him to make his own decisions with Laura about how they want to spend both the next five years and then the rest of his life. You have to assume he'll live 20 to 25 more years, and he seems to be in very good health. And I think he should just look at this as a whole new phase of his life. King: You opened the second Clinton Global Initiative University conference this past weekend and also a thousand students attended. How do you see the younger generation responding the global challenges, especially in these economic times? Clinton: There is a very large number of them who are doing astonishing things. For example, one young woman decided that she's going to go around and collect all the kitchen grease from all the dining halls and then nearby eateries and then use it to make biodiesels, to run cars and lawn mowers and generators. King: For all the years we've known each other, it never gets dull. Clinton: Thank you.","Bill Clinton talks in wide-ranging interview with CNN's Larry King .

"SAN MIGUEL DEL MONTE, Argentina (CNN) -- In a small farming town 105 kilometers (65 miles) southwest of Buenos Aires, farmers are struggling to nourish their crops and feed their animals. The worst drought in half a century has turned Argentina's once-fertile soil to dust and pushed the country into a state of emergency. Argentine farmers profited in years past from selling beef to the world, but some now struggle to feed their cattle. Cow carcasses litter the prairie fields and sun-scorched soy plants wither under the South American summer sun. Farmers are concerned about their livelihoods. ""I'm losing money. I can't afford to lose money all the time,"" said Juan Cahen D'Anvers, whose family has been farming in Argentina since the late 1700s. He owns 700 hectares (1,730 acres) in San Miguel del Monte, where he grows sunflowers and barley. He says this year is one of the hardest he's ever had.  Watch farmer explain how hard he's been hit » . ""Production is going to go down a minimum of 50 percent, maybe more. I don't know yet,"" he said. Argentina is one of the world's breadbaskets, providing commodities such as soy, wheat, corn and beef to countries around the globe. In recent years, record-high prices for these products reaped millions of dollars for Argentine farmers, but since the global economic crisis hit, demand and profits have dropped. Now the drought is making matters even worse. Cesar Gioia, another San Miguel del Monte farmer, said time is growing short. ""If it doesn't rain in the next 10 days, I will have to wipe out my entire corn crop, 90 hectares (220 acres),"" he said. ""The best I can do with it is feed it to my cows."" Facing pressure from farmers, Argentina President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced emergency measures this week that will exempt the worst-hit farmers from paying most taxes for one year. ""This is a big boost of patriotism, and a sign of support from all Argentines,"" Kirchner said on January 26. ""All other sectors of the economy will continue to contribute, so we can help the farmers who have been affected by this drought."" Kirchner has had a contentious relationship with farmers, who staged noisy protests and strikes last year over an increase in export taxes. Those taxes eventually were reduced, but farming leaders still contend that the government is out of touch with their needs. They say the measures announced this week fall short, and are demanding a cohesive, long-term plan for dealing with emergencies such as the current drought. If not, they say, they may strike again.  Watch how farmers reacted to Kirchner's move » . ""Sure, this plan is approved now, and it helps, but we need money to feed cows, to go back to planting crops, because this drought is impacting life in every sector of society,"" said Eduardo Buzzi of the Argentine Agrarian Federation. As she yanks dead soy plant vines from a dusty field in San Miguel del Monte, Lorena del Rios of the Argentina Rural Society says she expects the drought to affect both Argentine and overseas consumers, especially when it comes to Argentina's world-famous beef. ""We will see less meat available, which means rising prices,"" she said. ""There is even the possibility that in a few years Argentina will have to import beef, which is almost unthinkable for people here.""","Worst drought in 50 years is hitting Argentina .

"(CNN) -- The controversial pitch at the new Wembley stadium is to be dug up immediately. Wembley's pitch has come in for plenty of criticism since the stadium weas reopened in 2007. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger branded the surface 'a disaster' after the FA Cup semifinal defeat by Chelsea last Saturday, while Sir Alex Ferguson called it 'dead' in the aftermath of Manchester United's penalty shoot-out defeat to Everton 24 hours later. In the wake of such criticism, stadium officials decided to launch a thorough review of the pitch and have concluded the rye grass surface should be replaced with immediate effect. The new pitch will be a different composition to the current one, which it is hoped will be better suited to the stadium design. Although the FA had confirmed there would be a new 'sand-soil' pitch installed, it was not anticipated the work would be done until after next month's FA Cup final. There have been problems with the new stadium's pitch since it first opened just over two years ago. Due to the number of non-footballing events, including pop concerts, which are required at Wembley to make the rebuilding project viable, it was felt the rye-grass option was more likely to withstand the extra punishment. However, it has proved not to be the case, with Wenger claiming the surface is worse than at any of the 20 Premier League grounds. ""When you build a new stadium, the first priority is that the pitch is good,"" said Wenger on Tuesday. ""If that's not right the whole stadium is bad. ""Before everybody wanted to play at Wembley because the pitch was so special. Now, nobody wants to play at Wembley."" Although the FA acknowledge they will still need to change the pitch at regular intervals, the organisation is optimistic the work should at least allow Wembley to restore its previous reputation for a surface of the highest standard. A statement read: ""Wembley Stadium is a multi-purpose venue and needs to be able to offer both a quality playing surface and a quality calendar of events. ""The pitch has always been and will continue to be at the heart of the stadium and of the business.""","The controversial pitch at the new Wembley stadium to be dug up immediately .

Paul Grayhek says the ""Hand of God"" appeared in his backyard in March. Paul Grayhek, 52, listed the rock formation he dubbed the ""Hand of God Rock Wall"" on the online auction Web site eBay. The highest bid was $250 early Sunday, with three days left to go in the auction. The hand-like formation, approximately 9 feet tall and 4 feet wide, appeared in Grayhek's backyard after a rockfall during Lent on March 8, he said. The Coeur d'Alene resident said he faced tough times after losing his job, and believed the rock was a sign. ""I prayed between licking my wounds and looking for a job,"" he said. ""We rarely get rockfalls and this formation is 20 feet from my house. It's definitely a symbol of the hand of God in my life."" However, the winning bidder on eBay should not start clearing out his backyard. Grayhek is not planning to part with the formation. The buyer will ""basically be buying the rights, complete and exclusive rights"" to the rock, including literary and movie rights, according to Grayhek. Grayhek said he plans to use the money from the sale to pursue an unpaid internship in counseling when he graduates with a master's degree in social work in two years. ""People think I'm some holier-than-thou person trying to get rich. I'm not,"" Grayhek said.

"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- Scores of boat people who fled Myanmar and are now in Thailand are to be sent back despite human rights groups' concerns they could be tortured or killed upon return. A photograph released by the Thai navy shows a group of men captured on December 12. ""They will have to be sent back, according to our law,"" Thailand's Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva told CNN. ""They are entering the country illegally. We do what they would do."" The 12 boys and 66 men who arrived are among thousands of members of the Rohingya minority who have fled Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, because of persecution and in search of a better life. Many of them make it across a dangerous sea crossing in crowded boats to Thailand where they are housed in camps. But the Thai navy has been accused of forcing the boats back out to sea. The 78 people targeted for deportation are being held in Ranong, in southern Thailand. Two remain in hospital and no date has been set for the forced repatriation, an immigration official said. But human rights groups are concerned about what will happen to the men and boys when they return.   Watch how crowded boats were towed out to sea and abandoned » . ""We know as a point of fact that there are Rohingya who've been returned to Myanmar who have ended up in prison,"" Benjamin Zawacki, from Amnesty International, said. ""The Myanmar government has interviewed these 78. Our fear is that if these people are sent back, the government has a record of who they are, where their families are,"" Zawacki said. ""They may be tortured and or they could even be killed. That wouldn't be out of the question -- that is the real fear."" Sunai Phasuk, Thailand-Burma researcher for Human Rights Watch, said that the Rohingya had the ""unenviable distinction of being the most blighted"" people in Myanmar. ""Denied citizenship, subject to tight restrictions on movement, employment and religious freedoms, this Muslim minority have been the target of abuses by the Burmese military for decades,"" he said. ""Today they face serious risks of state violence and coercion, in part arising from preparations to build a pipeline through their region that will deliver offshore gas to China. Already reports are emerging of forced relocations and other abuses tied to gas exploitation."" The Myanmar government has not responded to CNN's request for an interview, but the plight of the Rohingya will be discussed at this weekend's ASEAN summit of South-East Asian nations, which the Myanmar prime minister and foreign minister are expected to attend. However, the man that effectively runs the country, Senior General Than Shwe, will not attend. Thai Prime Minister Vejjajiva has stressed the need for regional cooperation to help solve the problem of the thousands of Rohingya fleeing Myanmar. His government views them as economic migrants rather than political refugees and said it cannot accommodate them in Thailand. A recent CNN investigation found evidence that the Thai army was towing boatloads of Rohingya out to sea and cutting them adrift. Hundreds are thought to have died as a result. Vejjajiva said the practice has stopped and insisted the Rohingya were given supplies of food and water. ""We regret some of the incidents that have happened in the past. They are now being corrected,"" he said.","Thailand to deport nearly 80 men and boys .

"(CNN)  -- Judging by the hysterical reaction in some quarters, to President Obama's handshake with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, or his bow to Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, you would think that America's national security rested solely on body language not sound policy. The presidential handshake between Barack Obama and Hugo Chavez spurred many comments. But just for the record, let's not forget that President George W. Bush kissed and held hands with the same Abdullah after 9/11, while also looking deep into the soul of Vladimir Putin. And a generation earlier, egged on by British Prime Minister ""Iron Lady"" Margaret Thatcher, President ""Tear Down That Wall"" Ronald Reagan, decided that indeed Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was a man he could do business with: the business of ending the Cold War. While Obama has not managed in 100 days to defeat Islamic militants, usher in a Middle East peace treaty or disarm North Korea, on these and other issues he has laid down some important groundwork. Most importantly, the global polls following his first overseas trip show he has begun restoring America's name and reputation, key ingredients to successful policy making. Even before stepping onto foreign soil, Obama began by ordering the infamous Guantanamo Bay detention center closed, thus returning the United States to upholding the very same rule of law it preaches to other nations. He also has  stated over and over again that ""America does not torture,"" thus returning the United States to leading on human rights, not cherry-picking them. To those such as former Vice President Dick Cheney who claims this will make America more vulnerable, even some former Bush administration officials now concede that rigorous but patient above-board interrogation has proven to yield better, more reliable intelligence than a rush to the waterboard. Obama has kept a campaign pledge and given a fixed date for ending the unpopular U.S. war in Iraq. ""Let me say this as plainly as I can: By August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end,"" he announced. Yet the perils are clear. Hundreds of Iraqi civilians have been killed in Baghdad and other cities in a surge of sectarian violence since January. The Obama administration and U.S. military leaders are playing it down, blaming the suicide bombings on a few militant cells. That brings back memories of Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld blaming a ""handful of dead-enders"" as the original insurgency was getting into full swing. Much work still needs to be done to stabilize Iraq militarily and politically. Drawing down in Iraq means surging in Afghanistan, which along with Pakistan is still viewed as the central front on terror. ""If the Afghanistan government falls to the Taliban or allows al-Qaeda to go unchallenged,"" Obama said in March, ""that country will again be a base for terrorists."" So he has ordered 21,000 new U.S. troops there by summer. But for all the talk of more boots on the ground, negotiating with moderate Taliban and beefing up Afghan security forces, danger will persist unless the Afghan people see more of a peace dividend. As Obama himself recognizes, ""There will be no lasting peace unless we expand spheres of opportunity for the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan.""  Watch highlights from Obama's first 100 days » . Dire poverty still stalks the land and people desperate to feed their families will lay an IED for cash if they cannot farm or find a decent paying job. Although the Taliban had less than 8 percent support in Afghanistan at the end of 2007, according to an ABC poll, Afghan public opinion is turning against the U.S.-led coalition partly because of the rising number of civilian casualties as the U.S. military hunts down terrorists with airstrikes. The same is happening in Pakistan. When unmanned drones and other airstrikes target militants but cost many civilian lives, it turns people against the United States. One month ago, President Obama unveiled an Afghan-Pakistan strategy for stabilizing the region, and yet things have gotten so much worse in the weeks since that now he, British officials and other world leaders openly fear the Talibanization of nuclear-armed Pakistan. A furious Pakistan government accuses the United States of sowing panic among the people and insists it's in full control of its country and its nuclear arsenal. But it is hard to overdramatize the danger as this U.S. ally concedes land and appeases the Taliban, then watches as it reneges on a so-called ""peace deal"" and rolls ever closer to the capital, Islamabad. On May 6 and 7, Obama will be meeting in Washington with the presidents of Pakistan and Afghanistan. In the fight to deny the militants a tipping point momentum, the military tells me 2009 will be crucial. As for Iran, which even two years ago candidate Obama said would be directly engaged by his administration, there is nothing formal yet between the two sides. After 30 years of enmity, President Obama offered Iran ""the promise of a new beginning"" in a Persian New Year video message, and since then has clearly signaled the United States was over regime-change. The Iranian government and leadership have responded in kind, saying they are ready to engage with America if the administration is really committed to changing its Iran policy. However, much of this good will has been over the airwaves and direct or back-channel talks have yet to start. Into this vacuum are stepping all the sundry pro- and anti-Iran interest groups, experts, analysts and nations, with their often-conflicting advice and sometimes confused understanding. Yet it is widely acknowledged that a strategic realignment with Iran would benefit U.S. and regional security and stability. The new Israeli government wants to see no such thing, and wants people to believe it will bomb Iran's nuclear facilities, a belief it fosters with background briefings to journalists in the United States and presumably elsewhere. In an ironic twist, Israel's Arab neighbors are bringing their dire warnings about Iran to the White House. Meantime, Obama has named a new Middle East Peace envoy, former Sen. George Mitchell, signaling he wants to take negotiations out of the deep freeze and committing to the two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians. Trouble is new Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not signed on to the two-state solution and is trying to fend off this pressure, even suggesting Israel won't engage with the Palestinians until the United States takes care of Iran. Last week, Obama told Jordan's King Hussein at the White House, ""My hope would be that over the next several months you start seeing gestures of good faith on all sides."" He added, ""We can't talk forever; at some point, steps have to be taken so that people can see progress on the ground."" The president has invited the leaders of Israel, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority to the White House in coming weeks. iReport.com: Grade Obama's first 100 days . The second hundred days in foreign policy will be filled with mini-summits at the White House and major summits abroad -- Russia in July and China sometime later. With all this activity, Obama is clearly shifting the United States away from the ""isolate and punish"" policy of his predecessor.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Barack Obama is planning to issue three executive orders Thursday, including one demanding the U.S. military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay be closed within a year, according to a senior administration official and a congressional aide. A guard keeps watch from a tower at the military facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A second executive order will formally ban torture by requiring the Army field manual be used as the guide for terror interrogations, essentially ending the Bush administration's CIA program of enhanced interrogation methods. A third executive order, according to the officials, will order a systematic review of detention policies and procedures and a review of all individual cases. The officials said new White House Counsel Greg Craig was briefing congressional Republicans Wednesday afternoon about the three executive orders. ""We've always said the process would include consultation,"" the senior administration official said of the closed-door meeting informing Republicans of the moves. The detention facility at Guantanamo Bay became a lightning rod for critics who charged that the Bush administration had used torture on terror detainees. President George W. Bush and other senior officials repeatedly denied that the U.S. government had used torture to extract intelligence from terror suspects. Obama's move will set off a fierce legal struggle over where the prison's detainees will go next.  Watch experts debate the Gitmo dilemma » . ""The key question is where do you put these terrorists,"" House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement issued Wednesday. ""Do you bring them inside our borders? Do you release them back into the battlefield?"" The meeting with Craig did not address how the administration plans to handle Guantanamo detainees, said Rep. Bill Young of Florida, the top Republican on the Defense Appropriations Committee. The executive orders ""will leave some wiggle room for the administration,"" he said. Young said he has ""quite a bit of anxiety"" about transferring detainees to United States facilities. ""Number one, they're dangerous,"" he said. ""Secondly, once they become present in the United States, what is their legal status? What is their constitutional status? I worry about that, because I don't want them to have the same constitutional rights that you and I have. They're our enemy.""  Watch what may happen to Gitmo's inmates » . He said he asked Craig what the government plans to do with two recently built facilities at Guantanamo, which he said cost $500 million. He said Craig had no answer, but pledged to discuss the issue further. Young said he suggested reopening Alcatraz, the closed federal prison on an island outside San Francisco, California -- in Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's district. ""Put them in Alcatraz, where supposedly they can't escape from,"" Young said, but added the suggestion ""didn't go over well."" The revelation coincided with a judge's decision on Wednesday to halt the September 11 terrorism cases at the behest of President Obama. On Tuesday, he directed Defense Secretary Robert Gates to ask prosecutors to seek stays for 120 days so terrorism cases at the facility can be reviewed, according to a military official close to the proceedings. CNN's Susan Candiotti and Laurie Ure contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama to issue 3 orders Thursday that break from Bush administration .

"(CNN) -- Multiple Oscar winning film ""Slumdog Millionaire"" has brought the plight of India's slum dwellers to the rest of the world. But up to a million slum dwellers in the economic capital Mumbai are set for upheaval as the city is poised for a radical makeover . Dharavi, where parts of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" were filmed, is one of the largest slums in the world. Five years after the regional government announced its intention to redevelop Dharavi, the vast Mumbai slum where parts of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" were filmed, developers are finally submitting their blueprints for the project. Nineteen consortiums from around the world are vying to redevelop the 500-plus acres of land occupied by Dharavi and the bulldozers could move in within six months. The scheme is the brainchild of Mukesh Mehta, an Indian architect who made his name in the U.S. His vision is to use private money to redevelop the slum and turn Mumbai into an international business destination. ""If effectively designed and well planned Dharavi could be not very different from London's Canary Wharf. If we plan creatively and bring in the best architects in the world we could create a new language of architecture and buildings for Mumbai,"" he told CNN. What's novel about Mehta's plan is that rather than seeing a need to entice developers into slum regeneration, he views the land as a resource that developers will pay handsomely to get their hands on. The plan is for developers to demolish the slum and build apartments on the site, which will be given free of charge to 57,000 families currently living in Dharavi. The incentive? For every 100 sq ft of apartment space the developers give away, they will get to build 133 sq ft of commercial space, which they can sell at market rates. Back in 1997, it was Mehta who realized that Dharavi's location made it an asset. In the heart of Mumbai, Dharavi is connected by all three of the city's railway lines. The two highways that link Mumbai to the rest of India both start nearby and just half a kilometer away is the Bandra Kurla complex, Mumbai's emerging financial hub, where land prices are astronomical. Mehta estimates that the government could end up making $2 to $3 billion, the developers stand to make huge profits and Dharavi's residents will get real homes with running water. So why has the scheme taken 12 years to get off the ground? Part of the problem is the word 'slum.' Dharavi is terribly overcrowded, with a chronic lack of clean water and a dearth of toilets. Sewage runs freely and the stench of feces is ever present. But there is a real sense of community, the streets are buzzing with activity and thriving cottage industries, such as pottery and recycling workshops, operate from the ground floor of people's homes. ""The Dharavi redevelopment should not be thought of as just a housing project. Almost every house is involved with some kind of economic activity,"" says Sundar Burra, an advisor to the Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Entrees, which has been campaigning for years to ensure Dharavi's residents don't lose out in the redevelopment. Burra says it is essential that residents can continue to work from their homes in the new Dharavi, or they won't be able to afford the maintenance costs of their new apartments. ""If this is not considered, people will sell and the area will become gentrified. Even though new housing stock will be added to the city, the people for whom it is meant will not be able to benefit,"" he told CNN. In June 2007, some 15,000 Dharavi residents marched against the proposals, which they felt benefited developers at their expense. Mehta says planners have been listening to people's concerns. The new apartment buildings will incorporate communal spaces where residents can carry on their trades and thousands of businesses currently operating illegally in Dharavi will be legalized. Following objections from residents, the floor space allocated to each family has been increased from 225 sq ft to 300 sq ft. But not everyone in Dharavi stands to benefit. Many residents lease the upper floor of their homes and their tenants are not eligible for the free apartments. Neither is anyone who moved to Dharavi after 1999, nor the laborers who sleep in Dharavi's workshops. There is only one place for these people to go -- other slums. Burra concedes that no one knows how many people will be forced out, but it could be tens of thousands. Although some are still fighting the plan, Mehta considers it a fait accompli. He predicts that work will begin after the summer monsoon and will take five to seven years to complete. With over a billion people living in slums globally, Mehta sees this involvement of private money as essential for slum regeneration around the world. ""Every major university and design and planning institute in the world is studying this model,"" he says. ""Developing countries in Asia and Africa have invited me to have similar projects in their country. This is the future.""","Dharavi, in the heart of Mumbai, is one of the biggest slums in the world .

"(CNN) -- The three mothers hail from the same province in China, but they'd never met until a reckless driver in central Ohio killed their only children. From left, Sun ""Zoe"" Yan, Bian ""Jack"" Jin and Xue ""Jo"" Bing were students at Urbana University in Ohio. Two years later, the women wade through a cultural morass, struggling with American laws and language as they work to recoup the tens of thousands of dollars they borrowed to educate, and bury, their children. They've also lost their pride and possibly their future. In China, a family's future often rides on the education of its youngest member, and parents routinely mortgage the present for a brighter retirement. The three mothers have no good news for friends and relatives who stop by their homes in northeast China, sometimes for hours, asking for their money. The mothers face the cultural shame of not being able to repay them, and many of their creditors don't believe them when they explain they've received little compensation for their losses. ""Even after I die, I could not close my eyes,"" Cai Tie Juan said, describing her stress and exhaustion through a translator. On March 8, 2007, Cai's son, Bian Jin, 27, better known to his American counterparts as Jack, was returning from a spring break shopping trip with Sun Yan and Xue Bing, both 24.  Learn more about students » . According to the Dayton Daily News, Bian was driving. Sun, aka Zoe, and Bian's girlfriend, Xue -- whose friends called her Jo -- were in the backseat of Bian's Ford Taurus. They were trying to get back in time for Sun's 6:30 p.m. shift at a local Chinese restaurant in Urbana, Ohio, where the three attended graduate school. Witnesses told the newspaper that several cars were waiting at a traffic light when Jason Skaggs, then 34, approached the intersection of Urbana and Moorefield roads. Skaggs crashed his blue Chevy Tahoe into a Buick Skylark at 98 mph (about 158 kph), went airborne and sandwiched Bian's Taurus between the Tahoe and a gold Chrysler, witnesses and police told the paper. The Taurus was reduced to a ball of crumpled metal with tires. Bian, Sun and Xue were killed instantly. Four others, including Skaggs, were injured. See photos of wreck, trial from Dayton Daily News . Skaggs said he had had a seizure before barreling into the intersection, but the jury didn't buy the defense and found him guilty of aggravated vehicular homicide. During the trial, the media uncovered a litany of driving violations committed by Skaggs, including a speeding ticket he received for driving 91 mph in a 65-mph zone just weeks before the wreck. Skaggs also had been jailed for aggravated vehicular homicide in the past, after he had passed a car in a blind curve in 1994, killing a 79-year-old mother and her son, the Daily News reported. A judge in August sentenced Skaggs to the maximum 34 years in prison. The students' parents wonder how Skaggs had a license to begin with. He'd already killed two people and had no insurance. And if epilepsy played a role in the wreck, it only bolsters their belief he shouldn't have been driving in the first place. ""Why could somebody let this happen?"" Xue's mother, Sun Chun Zhi, asked through a translator. ""Obviously, he had a history of driving recklessly and had violated many traffic laws."" Chinese laws would've never let someone like Skaggs drive, and more frustratingly, they say, the Chinese government would've stepped in with financial help if this had happened in their homeland. Conversely, it is a Chinese law that has been most devastating. Because the world's most populous nation has for 30 years enforced a one-child-per-couple policy, Bian, Xue and Sun Yan had no siblings, so the families' prospects for the future were crushed in a Ford Taurus at the intersection of Urbana and Moorefield roads. ""When you raise a child in China, you are basically insuring your old age,"" Sun Yan's mother, Yu Ming, said, weeping as she spoke through a translator. Because Bian, Xue and Sun Yan had promising futures, their parents were confident asking friends, relatives, colleagues and even their kids' classmates for money to send them to graduate school at the 1,500-student Urbana University. In China, personal loans from banks aren't as common as they are in the U.S. More commonly, people borrow from friends and family, and you are honor bound to pay them back. There is no poor-mouthing or filing for bankruptcy. The university unveiled a memorial last year among three Lacebark Pines, a native Chinese tree. ""You return what you owe. It is the bible of heaven and the ground rule of Earth,"" Yu said, using a Chinese saying to explain the importance of honoring your debts. Each family borrowed in the neighborhood of 300,000 yuan, almost $44,000, to send their kids 6,500 miles to Urbana University. They each borrowed tens of thousands of dollars more for their children's funerals and several trips to the United States, some to attend Skaggs' trial. They've collectively received about $19,000 from a state victim's fund and $22,000 from a charitable fund established by Urbana University. Another fund set up by the university collected about $36,000, but much of the money went toward the families' funeral and travel bills. The mothers say they appreciate the donations because their pensions and pay are a pittance of what they owe. Xue's father is back home in Dalian City, a trading hub of about 6 million people on the Liaodong Peninsula near North Korea. The retired office manager earns a pension of about 1,600 yuan, or $234, a month. Bian's father and Sun Yan's father live in Shenyang, an industrial base of more than 7 million people, also near North Korea. Bian's father has been working all the overtime shifts he can muster and brings home about 3,500 yuan ($512) a month. Sun Yan's father is a farmer and receives no pension. Meanwhile, the mothers have been in Springfield, Ohio, living in a home donated by a sympathizer since November. They keep their living expenses as low as possible, subsisting off one meal a day to save money. Cai and Yu still collect their respective pensions of about 1,300 yuan ($190) and 700 yuan ($102) a month. Sun Chun Zhi has lost her job as an accountant because of all the trips she has made to the states in the last two years. The women say they are pleading with anyone they think can help -- university officials, the consulate, even a senator. Yu said she and her husband recently sold their cozy apartment in Shenyang and moved in with a niece in China to help pay off their debts, which included about 50,000 yuan ($7,312) that Yu and her four siblings scraped together to pay their father's medical bills from a recent surgery. ""It didn't amount to a lot of money,"" Yu said of the apartment sale. The mothers have considered suing Skaggs, who was represented at trial by a public defender, but lawyers have told them it's not worth it. Friends and family members regularly stop by their homes in China, asking, ""How could there possibly be no money? We really need money, too. Can you return it?"" Sun Chun Zhi said. ""They really don't understand why we didn't get any money. They didn't believe that ... they're not forcing you. They sit there and keep asking for money."" Added Yu, ""They're not rich, either. They save all this money, and they don't spend like Americans, they save. And then they lend it to me, and now they've lost it, too."" The mothers are coping with emotional problems as well. Sun said the death of her daughter has left the family feeling helpless and ""emotionally destroyed."" Yu, who did not eat for two days after the wreck, said she's lost her ""source of energy."" And Cai has taken up a regimen of sleeping pills to get some rest at night. ""It's not getting better. It also feels like my heart is almost failing me, and I feel my body is almost failing me,"" Cai said. Sun Chun Zhi said she, Cai and Yu sometimes struggle to grasp ""the meaning of why we need to survive"" after losing their only children. ""But we cannot fall apart now because we are trying to return the money to the people we borrowed it from,"" said Sun Chun Zhi. ""We're trying every possible way to return their money.""","Jason Skaggs had vehicular homicide conviction before he killed students .

"(CNN) -- Pontiac lovers are feeling nostalgic and mournful Monday amid General Motors announcement that it will end production of the car. Pontiac models, such as the 1969 GTO, helped usher in the era of the muscle cars, enthusiasts say. Jean Lindsay of western New York fondly recalls the muscle cars in her family's driveway: Two 1967 GTOs. ""I had two brothers, and they each had one of these cars,"" she said. ""The GTO represented the suburban culture of its time, heavily laden with root beer and plain beer."" ""Those were the days of Bob's Big Boy [hamburger restaurant], when girls wore skates. Back then we pleasantly wasted gas looking for fun. It was a social thing."" Debuting in 1964, the Pontiac GTO is widely regarded as the original muscle car. It was a risky model in that it featured a big-block engine in an intermediate-size frame. The GTO's success not only buoyed GM but helped jumpstart the high-performance market for Detroit's Big Three automakers -- and ushered in the era of the vehicle as status symbol.  Watch GM's CEO explain why the company is cutting Pontiac » . ""It was a chick magnet, for God's sake. Even from a girl's standpoint,"" Lindsay said. Pontiac's other emblematic performance car, the Firebird Trans Am, featured the outline of a firebird on the hood -- the whole hood. It enjoyed a rise in popularity and brisk sales after being featured in the ""Smokey and the Bandit"" movie franchise beginning in the late 1970s. But like even the most sturdy odometer, the numbers, years ago, had begun to work against Detroit. After years of watching their market share erode to foreign automakers, GM, Ford and Chrysler were beset by a perfect storm of declining sales, slow innovation and a dogged recession. While all three shed jobs, GM and Chrysler took bailouts to survive; Ford chose to rely on its cash reserves to ride out the storm. In February, GM announced the end of the Saturn and Hummer lines while casting a ray of hope for Pontiac enthusiasts by saying that the brand would survive but be scaled back to a niche product. GM could file bankruptcy as a June 1 deadline looms. In the midst of pressure from the Obama administration to present a restructuring plan that shows the company's long-term viability, the automaker recently released a statement to downplay fears that brands Americans have patronized for generations are on the chopping block. ""General Motors has not announced any changes to its long-term viability plan or to the future status of any of its brands,"" the automaker said Friday in a statement on its Web site. Pontiac fans said on Friday that contemplating the closure of Pontiac feels like a longtime friend pulling out of the driveway for the last time. ""I think it's crazy [to end the brand],"" Max Thompson of Huntsville, Alabama, said. ""I think they ought to streamline versions of Pontiac. Just take it to a few models. Make it special, but not get rid of it because it's too iconic."" ireport.com: See Thompson describe his wheels . Thompson, 46, said his 1973 Firebird Formula had him sold when he saw the stylistic front end. ""The hood of it looked cool,"" Thompson said. ""Just the front of it, it was a sexy-looking vehicle. It had a very sleek look for the time."" Thompson said he doesn't drive his Firebird anymore, preserving it as a memento with 65,000 miles on it. The Pontiac brand didn't just appeal to baby boomers. The younger generation seems to have bonded with the brand during their time behind the wheel, too. Brian Hemgesberg of Flint, Michigan, said one of the reasons why he purchased his 2008 Pontiac G6 last year was because of what's under the hood. ""I like the engine, I only got the V6. ... I want to get the G8,"" Hemgesberg said. When asked if he pushed the engine, Hemgesberg, 22, let out a telling laugh. ""Yeah,"" he said. Like other Pontiac owners, Hemgesberg doesn't want to see the brand die. ""I think it'd be a pretty big mistake. I won't stop buying GM, I'd just buy Chevy. I think [Pontiac] is just a very good brand of car.""","Pontiac owners say bye to glory days of muscular iconic car .

Thomas Carper, D-Delaware, as he folded himself into a yellow, low-slung vehicle known by the initials ENVI, developed by the Chrysler Corporation. ""Evan Bayh [Democratic senator from Indiana] and I were talking about taking a road trip in the van down there,"" said Carper, pointing to a nearby offering from General Motors. ""That's probably better for a road trip than this!"" Carper then spotted Democratic colleague Tom Harkin, and joked that the sports car might draw too much attention in the Iowa senator's corn country. Undeterred, Harkin climbed in next and asked to take a test drive. But instead of starting with a growling engine and a roar of exhaust, the little yellow coupe simply rolled quietly out of its parking space. It is an electric vehicle. The display, titled ""The Energy and Environmental Showcase,"" was intended to demonstrate for lawmakers actual production models of vehicles that may cut the nation's reliance on petroleum-based fuels. An unusual aspect of the show was that traditional Detroit nameplates such as General Motors sat next to competitors from other countries. The event was organized by Bright Automotive, a small carmaker from Anderson, Indiana, to showcase its IDEA, a new, 100-mpg plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that it hopes to market for government and commercial fleets. In a statement, the company said it has applied for funding through the federal Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program. Other manufacturers took advantage of the opportunity to bring their own vehicles to the public display, in a parking lot near the Russell Senate Office Building. During the Bush administration, Japanese automakers complained they weren't invited to a similar demonstration near the Treasury Department, despite having brought their alternative-energy cars more swiftly to the U.S. market than the Detroit automakers. But neither the competition nor the threat of bankruptcy held back the enthusiasm of a General Motors product spokesman at Tuesday's display. ""If anything, it's just a little bit of noise in the background,"" said Tony Posawatz, a GM vehicle line director. He told CNN the automaker places high on its recovery agenda the line of Volt electric cars expected to come to market by November 2010. A silver GM sedan on display nearby uses electric batteries and a self-contained recharging engine powered by a variety of fuels. ""I would like people to stop talking mpg,"" Posawatz said, leading a reporter toward a van powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. The Chevy Equinox on display is one of 100 now in private hands. Instead of miles per gallon, the energy plant supplies electricity and a calculation of cruising range while driving. For now, however, drivers might still be impressed by the ZENN, a little car claiming 280 miles per gallon. The car's cruising range of about 40 miles translates to about 280 miles per gallon, according to the Canadian automaker. ""ZENN"" stands for Zero Emission No Noise, said a worker who was buffing away some tree pollen that had settled on the car during the breezy afternoon. The car's top speed is about that of a strong gust of wind -- 35 mph. ""It's supposed to be your third car in the driveway,"" explained ZENN spokesman Daniel Stiller. ""Most people drive less than 20 miles from home on streets with speed limits of 35 miles per hour or less."" He acknowledged that the car may qualify as street-legal only on local, low-speed roads. But Stiller said the ZENN is a dramatic improvement in both safety and driveability, compared with the golf carts often seen around retirement communities. Among the other alternative energy vehicles on display were cars from Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Honda and the Smart car company. Another brand shown to lawmakers is named after Nikola Tesla, an inventor who helped develop the practical use of electricity a century ago. Tesla's system of alternating current eventually displaced Thomas Edison's use of direct current in the nation's early power grid. The red, two-seater electric sports car on display might have been a good fit for Tesla, a lifelong bachelor. Carper, the Delaware senator, suggested the two sports cars were classic ""chick magnets."" Tesla spokesman Joe Powers told CNN his company now has about 400 of the sleek, aerodynamic cars in private hands. ""We've created a viable car, and we came out with this model first to help draw attention to the Tesla brand,"" he said. The California-based company also is developing a a sedan that will use the same advanced battery technology as the sports car, which costs about $109,000. ""It will be the kind of car you can take on a trip, and carry four passengers and their luggage,"" Powers said. It uses 7,000 lithium-ion cells of the same chemistry now powering cell phones and laptop computers. ""We are working on a battery exchange program that will cut the cost of these vehicles by about $35,000,"" Powers said, describing a leasing program where owners can swap a used-up battery back for a new one. Most of the vehicles on display qualify for a new $7,500 federal rebate intended to encourage car buyers to consider alternative-energy vehicles. Perhaps the vehicle that caused the most double-takes Tuesday was a bucket truck from the local electric utility company serving the Washington, D.C., area. The Pepco vehicle, the kind seen repairing downed power lines, runs on biofuels that range from discarded cooking grease to soybean oil. The truck was apparently not for sale, and there were no representatives nearby to answer questions.","An eclectic assortment of alternative-energy vehicles hit Capitol Hill this week .

"(CNN) -- Icelandic Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir of the center-left Social Democratic Alliance has claimed victory in general elections triggered by the collapse of the Nordic nation's economy. Sigurdardottir celebrates victory on Saturday night. Sigurdardottir's party, which has headed an interim government since February 1, was on course to win around 30 percent of the vote or 20 parliamentary seats, according to state broadcaster RUV. The Left-Green Movement, the Social Democratic Alliance's coalition ally, was expected to win 14 seats, giving the coalition a controlling 34-seat block in the 63-member Icelandic parliament, the Althing. ""I believe this will be our big victory,"" Sigurdardottir told supporters, according to Reuters.com. ""I am touched, proud and humble at this moment when we are experiencing this great, historic victory of the social democratic movement."" Sigurdardottir's electoral success marks a change of direction for Iceland, a nation 300,000 people, which has traditionally leaned to the right on political matters. Sigurdardottir, the world's first openly gay leader and Iceland's first female premier, has pledged to take the Atlantic island into the European Union and to join the euro common currency as a viable way to rescue Iceland's suffering economy. But that ambition could bring Sigurdardottir into conflict with the Left-Green Movement which favors a currency union with Norway as an alternative to EU membership. Iceland has been in political turmoil since October, when its currency, stock market and leading banks crashed amid the global financial crisis. The country's Nordic neighbors sent billions of dollars to prop up the economy, as did the International Monetary Fund in its first intervention to support a Western European democracy in decades. But weekly demonstrations -- some verging on riots -- finally forced Prime Minister Geir Haarde and his Independence Party-led center-right coalition to resign en masse on January 26. The Independence Party was projected to win 16 seats in Saturday's vote, according to RUV.","Center-left secures re-election in Icelandic vote triggered by financial crisis .

"(CNN)  -- A former University of Georgia professor, wanted in the fatal shootings of his wife and two other people over the weekend, purchased a plane ticket to the Netherlands for May 2, authorities said Monday. An alert on the UGA Web site says professor George Zinkhan  is a suspect in an off-campus shooting. A nationwide manhunt for George Zinkhan, 57, extended into a third day with no sign of him, authorities said. Zinkhan was a marketing professor at the university's Terry College of Business, but was terminated on Sunday, the day after the shootings, university officials said. Zinkhan had previously purchased the plane ticket to the Netherlands, said Gregory Jones, special agent in charge for the FBI's Atlanta, Georgia, office. Authorities say Zinkhan owns a home in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The FBI is working with its agents overseas and police in the Netherlands, Jones said. A nationwide alert for Zinkhan has been issued by Athens-Clarke County police. The shootings took place at a community theater group's reunion Saturday in Athens, Georgia, just off campus. Police Capt. Clarence Holeman identified the victims as Marie Bruce, 47, Zinkhan's wife and a prominent Athens attorney; Tom Tanner, 40; and Ben Teague, 63. The university terminated Zinkhan on Sunday, President Michael Adams told reporters on Monday. Police said Zinkhan has relatives in Texas and owns a home in Amsterdam, Netherlands. He was last seen driving a red, 2005 Jeep Liberty after the shootings Saturday. Authorities do not believe Zinkhan is still on campus or in the city of Athens, University Police Chief Jimmy Williams said Monday. As a precaution, he added, security has been beefed up on campus, including officers on foot patrols carrying semiautomatic weapons. The victims were all associated with the Town and Gown Players, a theater group that was holding a reunion picnic at the time of the shootings. ""The three people we lost (Saturday) were a part of the rich 50-year history of this theater and, more than that, were vital members of the Town and Gown family,"" the organization said Sunday on its Web site. The site described Bruce as ""the binding force that held the Town and Gown community together."" ""Having worked with Town and Gown for over 20 years, at one time or another she served in every capacity at the theater, artistically and administratively, from leading lady to president of the board to chief cook and bottle washer."" Holeman said Saturday, ""It appeared (Zinkhan) and his wife (Bruce) were having problems."" Meanwhile, the university said that classes would be held Monday, as the school term enters its final week. In a letter ""to the members of the University of Georgia community"" posted on the school's Web site, Adams said operations would continue uninterrupted. But, ""I urge everyone to continue to exercise caution until the suspect is apprehended,"" Adams said. Adams' letter said counseling would be available to any member of the faculty or staff and to students. The university's annual end-of-year campus memorial service, in which those lost over the past year are remembered, is scheduled for Tuesday night, Adams said. Victims of Saturday's shooting will be honored at that service. Police said Zinkhan was not at the Town and Gown event originally but arrived and, according to Holeman of the Athens police, got into ""a disagreement"" with his wife. He left the scene, and police believe he went to his car, where the couple's children apparently were waiting, and returned with two handguns. The shootings ""only took a few minutes,"" Holeman said. Police found eight shell casings. After the shooting, Zinkhan left the scene with his children -- ages 8 and 10 -- still in the vehicle, police said. He drove to a neighbor's home in nearby Bogart, Georgia, where he lived and left the children there. The neighbor, Bob Covington, told CNN that Zinkhan arrived at his home shortly after noon with the two children. ""He rang the doorbell, asked me if I could keep his kids for about an hour,"" Covington said. ""I said sure, and he said there'd been some type of emergency, and he took off."" Zinkhan seemed hurried and agitated but that seemed consistent with an emergency, Covington said. He didn't question Zinkhan about the emergency, Covington said, adding that it wasn't unusual for someone in his family to watch the children. An hour or so later, he said, police arrived and took the children. Police searched Zinkhan's home on Saturday, but there was no indication of what evidence they might have gathered there. University police were assisting Athens-Clarke County police in their investigation, officials said Monday. The university activated its alert system following the shooting with a description of the suspect, said spokesman Tom Jackson. Statistics show the university was able to reach 82 percent of the 64,000 people it attempted to contact, he said, adding that some of the calls went to university offices unstaffed on weekends. An alert was also posted on the school's Web site, and an all-campus e-mail was sent Saturday night. Adams said the university's provost and deans would determine how to handle the remainder of classes and exams for the classes -- one graduate and one undergraduate -- taught by Zinkhan.","NEW: Plane ticket to Netherlands dated May 2, FBI says .

"Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a bestselling author whose current book is ""When We Get to Surf City: A Journey Through America in Pursuit of Rock and Roll, Friendship, and Dreams."" Bob Greene says John Madden has had a great perk: seeing America on his own bus. (CNN) -- You've undoubtedly heard that John Madden has left the football broadcast booth. What you may not have heard is that he's not leaving his bus. ""It's been such a great ride,"" Madden said as he announced his retirement. But the truly great ride -- the one he will not relinquish -- wasn't his long career as a National Football League broadcaster. The best ride was the literal one. Madden's aversion to flying in airplanes led him to perhaps the grandest business perk in all of American life: He was given his own bus, with his own professional drivers. He crisscrossed the country, on his way from one big game to another, on what came to be known as the Maddencruiser, the cost of which eventually was underwritten by corporate sponsorship. Now. . .you may think that being stuck in a bus for days and nights on end must be a lousy way to lead a life. Not when you're the only passenger -- you, or whatever buddies and colleagues you choose to invite along. Not when there's food and drink onboard, and television sets with DVD players at the ready, and plenty of room to stretch out and observe the country as it passes by. And those amenities leave out the most beautiful lure of all. Let President Obama explain it. He did, inadvertently, the other week. He wasn't talking about Madden -- he was talking about plans for a new high-speed rail system. These were the president's words: . ""No racing to an airport and across a terminal, no delays, no sitting on the tarmac, no lost luggage, no taking off your shoes [at the metal detector]. . . . "" That's the gift Madden gave himself, by working out the bus deal -- the gift of avoiding the endless headaches of travel the rest of the world has to endure. Departure time? Whenever he wants. Flight cancellations? No such thing. Cramped seats? Nope. Security lines? There are none. It can make for a pretty peaceful life. A football game to see every week, the country winding gloriously out ahead of you between stadiums, your main decision boiling down to how to chop up the miles, where to eat and where to sleep and where to stop for a few hours just to talk to people. . . . There is a hotel on the west coast of Florida where I have stayed quite often, and during football season Madden would sometimes stay there too. If there had been a game in, say, Miami, and the next one was in Dallas, he might ask his bus driver to stop for the night at this place, which features outlying cottages on the Gulf of Mexico. Talk about a guy who seemed tranquil -- I know his on-air image was always sort of loud and animated, but I'd see Madden having a serenely silent and unhurried meal by himself in the restaurant, leisurely flipping through the sports pages; I'd see him in the little sandwich shop/deli in the morning, a quiet and amiable fellow standing in line with everyone else, waiting to pay for his breakfast pastries; I'd see him, on departure day, strolling blissfully toward his bus, an overnight bag in his hand, having decided that this was the time that he'd like to roll out. . . . Who would ever have thought that a fantasy life could revolve around something as seemingly mundane as a bus? But in a chaotic and confused world, full of noise and anger and deadlines, the allure of cruising in splendid solitude through the country, seeing America mile by mile, the journey itself being the ultimate victory. . . . Madden is the grand champion of bus riders, the winner of the lifetime achievement award. And for those who thought that Madden must have felt trapped on that bus for all these years, the truth -- I can promise you this -- is that rolling through the country that way is the opposite of being trapped. The highway begins to feel like a best friend; as well as you may have thought you knew America before, you begin to understand it in ways you never even considered. Block by block, town by town, state by state, you appreciate anew: There are still so many things to see. So I wasn't surprised when Madden, after declaring that the football life he is leaving had been a great ride, said that, by the way, he's keeping the bus. When he travels, that's how he will do it, with or without a corporate sponsor, even now that there will be no game waiting on the other end. And of course, after all these years there is a certain remarkable aura that has formed around the man and that bus of his. At the place in Florida where he would sometimes stay, I was coming back from dinner one night and saw two local police squad cars on the property. This was highly unusual; the town was a quiet dot on the map. I asked the police officers if there had been a crime committed. They appeared a little sheepish. They exchanged glances, as if deciding whether to tell me their real reason for being there. Finally one of them laughed, and said: . ""We just wanted to look at John Madden."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: John Madden's retiring as a broadcaster but keeping his bus .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British military investigators interviewed a woman who claimed to have met a man from another planet while she was walking her dog, newly released Ministry of Defence files have revealed. The woman said she had been approached by a man with a ""Scandinavian-type accent"" dressed in a flying suit-style outfit while out walking on a sports field near Norwich, eastern England, in 1989. She claimed to have been ""completely terrified"" during the 10-minute encounter. Running home, she said she had then seen a large glowing object rising vertically from behind some nearby trees. The woman called a local military base to report the encounter the following day. A cover note on the file of the incident describes it as ""one of our more unusual UFO reports."" The incident is just one of around 1,200 sightings recorded by investigators between 1987 and 1993, according to the files released by the National Archives on Sunday. On another occasion, military officials took the unusual step of briefing ministers about an unidentified flying object photographed in the sky over Scotland alongside an RAF fighter jet. Witnesses claimed to have seen the large diamond-shaped object hanging in the air for about 10 minutes before it ascended vertically at high speed. Fearing intense media interest, investigators also commissioned detailed drawings of the object. The files also reveal that the Ministry of Defence abandoned plans to build a computer database of sightings out of fears of a public relations disaster should details of its existence ever be revealed. ""I personally doubt that the the MoD would lose much if we filed UFO reports in 'WPD' (the waste paper basket),"" one unnamed official wrote of the project.","National Archives releases details of recorded UFO sightings from 1987 to 1993 .

"LIMA, Peru (CNN)  -- Doctors in Peru started a 48-hour strike Tuesday over pay and other benefits they say the government agreed to last year but has not delivered. The Medical Federation of Peru's Julio Vargas says, ""The stoppage ... will require the cooperation of all doctors."" The doctors' union, the Medical Federation of Peru, called the strike after meeting Monday with Prime Minister Yehude Simon, news sources reported. ""The stoppage that we will implement ... will require the cooperation of all doctors and that they suspend their external consults, although we will reinforce intensive and emergency care,"" union President Julio Vargas was quoted as saying in El Comercio newspaper. Health Minister Oscar Ugarte said the government has complied with all the agreements reached last year and the doctors have no reason to strike, RPP radio reported. Ugarte also warned doctors they will not be paid while on strike, the Andina news agency and El Comercio said. ""You can't stop working and later come and say, 'Pay me,' "" Ugarte said in El Comercio. ""That is immoral and does not conform with professional ethics."" At issue are pay for special work and more equal pay among state doctors, the news reports said. Salaries for doctors in Peru have decreased to one-fourth of 1976 levels, The Lancet professional medical journal reported in May 2008. As a result, physicians often hold two or more jobs to make ends meet. An average doctor's salary in Lima, the capital, is the equivalent of $670 a year, The Lancet said. A 2007 survey of 202 interns in Lima showed that 38 percent were thinking about migrating to a developed country to practice medicine, the publication said. Salary was one of the main reasons given.","Doctors' union calls for 48-hour strike after meeting with Peru's prime minister .

"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (CNN) -- Search operations resumed Monday for six U.S. citizens missing since their small plane crashed Sunday evening off the north coast of Puerto Rico. The U.S. Coast Guard found debris late Sunday night in the area where the single-engine Cessna 206 went down, half a nautical mile from the shoreline of the city of Quebradillas. But despite five searches Sunday and two others throughout the night, rescue crews were not able to find the pilot or the five passengers from the plane, the Coast Guard said Monday. Three searches are planned for Monday, said Coast Guard spokesman Ricardo Castrodad. The private plane, chartered by Tropical Aviation Corp., took off from the Dominican Republic and was on its way to an airport in Puerto Rico when it went down Sunday evening, officials said. Three male and two female passengers were returning to Puerto Rico after spending the weekend in the Dominican Republic, said Noemi Corporan, service manager for Tropical Aviation Corp. The passengers were San Juan residents and had flown to the Dominican Republic on Friday, she said. Four HH-65 Dolphin helicopters from Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen and the Coast Guard Cutter Matinicus are taking part in the search, said spokesman Castrodad. The airplane took off from Casa de Campo International Airport in the Dominican Republic and was supposed to land at the Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport in Carolina to clear U.S. Customs before going on to the Isla Grande Airport in San Juan, the Coast Guard said. A 911 emergency operator notified the Coast Guard at 6:51 p.m. Sunday that an aircraft had crashed into the waters off Quebradillas. The debris field was found around 10:30 p.m.","NEW: Three searches are planned for Monday, according to Coast Guard .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger's run-in with a flock of Canada geese may be the most famous man-versus-nature story in recent months. But a federal database opened to the public Friday reveals just how commonplace airplanes' encounters with wildlife are. A  feather found inside one of the engines of the plane that ditched in the Hudson River. At New York's LaGuardia Airport, where Sullenberger's US Airways flight originated, planes hit birds nearly once a week on average, according to the records. But the number has grown from 16 hits in 1990 to 86 in 2008, according to the database. Nationwide, there were 98,328 reports of aircraft striking birds or other wildlife since January of 1990, although the actual numbers probably are far higher. The Federal Aviation Administration said only 20 percent of incidents are reported under the voluntary system of data collection. The database shows strikes resulted in ""substantial damage"" to aircraft on about 3,000 occasions. Eleven people died in incidents relating to bird strikes. The FAA initially fought to keep its database closed, saying publication of the details might discourage the industry from reporting information. After it was made public, an airline industry organization was quick to say the data could wrongly lead some people to believe flying is unsafe. ""While bird strikes have attracted a lot of attention, they are, of course, rare events. The vast majority of cases result in little or no aircraft damage,"" said the Air Transport Association of America. A top pilots union -- the Air Line Pilots Association -- also had argued to keep the database closed. But the National Transportation Safety Board recommended opening up the data to the public. It also says reporting wildlife strikes should be mandatory. ""If you strike a bird you really don't have to report this to the FAA, which means we're really not getting the full picture,"" said Mark Rosenker, acting chairman of the safety board. The database includes information on more than 2,000 airports and 500 airlines and aircraft companies. When possible, it identifies the types of wildlife involved, chronicling the misadventures of 460 species. While bird strikes account for the majority of the mishaps, the database contains numerous aircraft encounters with deer, moose, caribou and even fish. According to the records, a fish hit a US Airways aircraft landing in Warwick, Rhode Island, in May of 2000. The fish had been dropped by an osprey. The FAA opted to make the database public after being pelted with criticism from passengers, media organizations and the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates crashes. Interest in aviation bird strikes has been heightened by several recent incidents in addition to Sullenberger's flight -- the January 15 ditching of US Airways Flight 1549 in New York's Hudson River. All on board survived. The transportation safety board says a bird strike may have preceded the crash of a Sikorsky helicopter near Morgan City, Louisiana, just 11 days earlier. The crash killed eight of the nine people aboard.","Planes hit birds nearly once a week on average at LaGuardia Airport .

"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN)  -- Colombo has been hit by a second bomb blast in only 24 hours following the fall of the Tamil Tigers' capital to government troops. Police and army officials at the site of a suicide bombing in Sri Lanka's capital Colombo Friday. Two people were wounded and a store damaged in the Petard commercial district Saturday. A day earlier a suicide bomber on a motorcycle blew himself up outside an air force headquarters in Colombo, killing two air force police officers and a member of the bomb-disposal unit. Another 30 people were injured. The attacks come after President Mahinda Rajapaksa urged the  Tigers to lay down their arms and end a quarter-century of civil war. He made his call after  government troops retook the separatists' capital, Kilinochchi. In a televised statement Friday evening, Rajapaksa called the recapture of Kilinochchi ""a victory against separatism."" ""The time is not far off when people of the north can breathe freedom again,"" Rajapaksa said. He invited the Tigers -- who have fought for an independent homeland for Sri Lanka's ethnic Tamil minority since 1983 -- to surrender as government troops closed in on their last remaining strongholds. Rajapaksa's announcement was met with fireworks in Colombo, and Friday's news prompted celebrations in other cities as well. The Tamil Tigers ran a parallel administration from Kilinochchi with their own police force, courts, prisons and taxes, and they had declared government plans to retake the city a ""daydream."" But after Sri Lanka launched a new offensive against the rebels in the fall, the insurgents moved their nerve center and logistics bases to Mullaitivu, on the northeastern coast. Sri Lankan troops have been on the outskirts of Kilinochchi, about 580 km (360 miles) north of Colombo, for more than a month. They took a key highway junction and a town outside the city Thursday. The civil war has left more than 65,000 people dead. The U.S. State Department has designated the Tamil Tigers a terrorist organization.","Suicide bomber strikes in Colombo, injuring two and damaging store .

"CNN -- Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the world, particularly in developing countries. Tobacco use is one of the largest causes of cancer in the world. In 2008 a report by the International Agency for Research on Cancer revealed that, until recently,  cancer was considered a disease of westernized, industrialized countries. Today the situation has changed dramatically, with the majority of the global cancer cases now found in the developing world. However, myths and misconceptions about cancer still abound. Below CNN's Vital Signs has compiled facts from the World Health Organization about this killer disease. -- There are more than 100 types of cancers; any part of the body can be affected. -- Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide: In 2007, it accounted for 7.9 million deaths (around 13 per cent of all deaths) in 2007. -- The five most common types of cancer that kill men worldwide are (in order of frequency): lung, stomach, liver, colorectal and esophagus. -- While for women worldwide the five most common types of cancer are: breast, lung, stomach, colorectal and cervical. -- About 72 per cent of all cancer deaths in 2007 occurred in low- and middle-income countries. -- Deaths from cancer worldwide are projected to continue rising, with an estimated 12 million deaths in 2030. -- The WHO estimates that 30 per cent of cancers can be prevented, mainly by not using tobacco, having a healthy diet and being physically active. -- Tobacco use is the single largest preventable cause of cancer in the world. -- A third of cancers could be cured if detected early and treated adequately. -- A fifth of all cancers in the world are caused by a chronic infection, for example human papillomavirus (HPV) causes cervical cancer and hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes liver cancer.

"(CNN) -- Same-sex couples in California may be able to obtain marriage licenses on June 17, state officials said Wednesday. Marriage licenses for same-sex couples may be available in June, officials said. The California Supreme Court struck down the state's ban on same-sex marriage as unconstitutional in a May 15 ruling, clearing the way for the state to become the second to legalize such marriages. The state Department of Public Health -- which serves as State Registrar and oversees vital records -- said in an announcement that June 16 is the last day the state Supreme Court can rule on any requests for re-hearing. It released new marriage license forms for counties to use beginning the following day. The new forms, which were also released, have lines for ""Party A"" and ""Party B."" However, the ""general information"" page for California marriage licenses still stated as of Wednesday that ""only an unmarried male and an unmarried female may marry in California."" The California Supreme Court issued the ruling in a consolidated case involving several gay and lesbian couples, along with the city of San Francisco and gay rights groups. A lower court had ruled San Francisco acted illegally in issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in 2004. In its 4-3 ruling, the state Supreme Court called marriage a ""basic civil right."" Opponents of same-sex marriage have said a constitutional marriage amendment should be placed on the November ballot, and that national efforts should be made to generate a federal marriage amendment. A constitutional amendment initiative that would specify marriage is only between a man and a woman is awaiting verification by the California Secretary of State's office after its sponsors said they had gathered enough signatures to place it on a statewide ballot. Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriages in 2004, and gay couples need not be state residents there to wed. However, then-Gov. Mitt Romney resurrected a 1913 law barring non-resident marriages in the state if the marriage would be prohibited in the partners' home state. Subsequent court and agency decisions have determined that only residents of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Mexico may marry in Massachusetts, unless the parties say they plan to relocate there after the marriage. New Hampshire, Vermont, New Jersey and Connecticut permit civil unions, while California has a domestic-partner registration law. More than a dozen other states give same-sex couples some legal rights, as do some other countries.","Court officials said licenses could be given out next month .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States is keeping a close eye on Pakistan after this week's Taliban surge into the Buner district brought them just 60 miles from the capital, Islamabad. A Taliban fighter in the district of Buner, which is only 96 kilometers from Islamabad. A Pakistani government official said Friday that the insurgents had completely withdrawn from the district by the end of the week, but a human rights group said people in Buner were reporting that local Taliban remained in the district. And senior U.S. officials cautioned that any withdrawal by the Taliban was likely meaningless and that the fundamentalist group now holds large areas of the country with the government seemingly unable to stop them. ""We're certainly moving closer to the tipping point,"" Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff said on NBC's ""Today"" show Friday. In the interview from Afghanistan, Mullen said he was ""extremely concerned"" about indications the Taliban is moving closer to Pakistan's capital of Islamabad. Syed Mohammed Javed, commissioner of the Malakand Division that includes Buner, said the Taliban withdrew on Friday without any conditions. Earlier in the day, Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan told CNN that the militants would pull back from the district. Pakistani Express TV showed live footage of armed and masked Taliban militants in Buner, loading pickup trucks and driving away. Sufi Muhammed, an Islamist fundamentalist leader who has been negotiating on behalf of the Taliban, was on scene overseeing the withdrawal, police said. U.S. military commander Gen. David Petraeus credited about 300 Pakistan's Frontier Corps with driving Taliban militants out of Buner. The U.S. Central Command chief spoke to CNN on Friday after testifying before a Congressional panel about the need for the United States to boost its support for Pakistani counterinsurgency troops such as the Frontier Corps. But Amnesty International's regional chief said people in Buner are reporting a different situation. ""What we're hearing from people in Buner ... is that the Taliban that have moved out are the non-local ones,"" Sam Zarifi, Amnesty's Asia Pacific director, told CNN. ""So the local branch of the Taliban are still in place in Buner."" Amnesty International is concerned that those local Taliban will continue to enforce the Taliban's ""abusive and repressive"" control of Buner. Girls over the age of 7 are forced to wear a burka, a head-to-toe covering that the Taliban say is required of Muslims under its radical interpretation of Islamic law, or sharia. ""I think we're going to see those harsh edicts stay,"" Zarifi said. The Taliban installed strict Islamic law when it took over Afghanistan after a two-year fight with warlords, many of whom surrendered without a fight. They fought with a coalition of some of those warlords known as the Northern Alliance from 1996 until U.S. forces, seeking the leadership of al Qaeda after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, added bombing raids to Northern Alliance ground operations and successfully drove the Taliban out of most of Afghanistan. iReport: Should the U.S. intercede in Pakistan? But the Taliban regrouped in 2004, launching a guerrilla war against the Afghan government while operating from the tribal areas of that country and Pakistan. Meanwhile, senior U.S. officials said that the ""retreat"" was likely meaningless. Control was the impetus behind the Taliban move into Buner, and the fundamentalist group now controls large areas of Pakistan, they said. The officials said, however, that they did not believe the Taliban's goal was to take over the government of Pakistan but rather to create instability by taking advantage of Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari's apparent inability to cope with the situation. Zardari, they said, does not understand the gravity of the situation, remains distracted by domestic politics and appears unable to make critical decisions to deploy the army to stabilize the country. State Department envoy Richard Holbrooke has been on the phone ""nonstop"" with officials in Islamabad and Washington, the officials said, providing frequent information to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Obama. Holbrooke's read on the situation, officials familiar with the conversation said, is that the Pakistani government does not know how to handle the situation and is looking to the United States for direction. A senior military official, however, presented a more dire case. Pakistan is ""rapidly deteriorating,"" he said. He said that he could not rule out the possibility of a military takeover in Islamabad, although he added that such a prospect was not in the immediate future. As for Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, he said the weapons ""are safe for now"" but that the United States is monitoring the safety systems in place. Administration officials said that the Pakistani military had assured the United States it would not act without an express order from the civilian leadership. Earlier this week, Clinton warned that nuclear-armed Pakistan was in danger of falling into terrorist hands. Before the Taliban's apparent withdrawal Friday, a local Pakistani official expressed doubt about whether the militants would leave, as they pledged to local elders on Thursday. ""Nobody can trust them,"" Sardar Hussain Babik, the provincial education minister, said by phone from Buner. The Taliban have broken promises before and probably would do so again, he said. Militants who swarmed into Buner subsequently locked up courthouses, seized court documents and battled Pakistani troops who were sent to protect residents. The militants said they took control of the district to ensure that Islamic law was properly imposed. The Pakistani government called the land grab a breach of a recent peace agreement. CNN's Barbara Starr, Elise Labott, Ivan Watson, Tricia Escobedo and Samson Desta contributed to this report.","NEW: Pakistan situation ""rapidly deteriorating,"" says senior U.S. military official .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN)  -- Pakistan launched an offensive against the Taliban on Saturday, the biggest military push against militants in Pakistan's northwestern tribal region since a civilian government took power in March. A Pakistan army vehicle patrols a troubled district of South Waziristan, in the northwest of Pakistan. Army spokesman Gen. Athar Abbas said the operation occurred in the Khyber section of the tribal region, west of Peshawar, the capital of the North-West Frontier Province. And it comes as the new administration announced that it would get tough with radicals in the region. There had been reports that Peshawar was being threatened by militants. Although Abbas said the reports were exaggerated, the military determined that the conditions in the area necessitated action. Troops cleared three militant outposts and pushed the insurgents west, Abbas said. There were no immediate reports of militant resistance or any casualties. The area is not far from the Afghan-Pakistan border. The Taliban militant movement has a strong presence in the tribal region and in neighboring Afghanistan, and there also have been numerous attacks on that restive border in recent weeks. U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said this week that he hopes a newly announced Pakistani effort to clamp down on Islamic militants in its northwestern tribal districts will improve the situation in Afghanistan. ""What has happened is that as various agreements have been negotiated or were in the process of negotiation with various groups by the Pakistani government ... the pressure was taken off of these people and these groups, and they've therefore been more free to be able to cross the border and create problems for us,"" he said at the Pentagon. Meanwhile, the the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan reported that 32 militants had been killed two days ago during Afghan and coalition operations in southern Afghanistan. The fighting occurred in Uruzgan province and the report comes amid Pentagon warnings of a ""resilient insurgency"" by the Taliban. Afghan and coalition forces were ambushed Thursday during a patrol. They returned fire and called in airstrikes that killed three militants. Soon after, the militants again attacked the patrol. The forces then killed 29 insurgents. ""During this engagement, insurgents attempted to disguise themselves in women's clothing in order to escape,"" the coalition said. A child and two police officers were wounded. This is the latest report of fighting across Afghanistan, where there has been an uptick in Taliban militant activities in the south, the east, and the Afghan-Pakistan border region. On Friday, a coalition service member was killed in Farah province. The death toll of U.S. and allied troops killed in Afghanistan in June has reached 40, the highest monthly toll of the war. Also, NATO's International Security Assistance Force were attacked in Paktika and Kunar provinces. Strikes in Kunar killed two civilians and wounded 11 others. Insurgents in both Pakistan and Afghanistan fired rockets at the Paktika base, but there were no casualties reported. A Pentagon report on security in Afghanistan underscored the tenacity of the Taliban. It said that although there has been some progress in battling the Taliban, setbacks are expected. Although NATO and Afghan force operations kept the insurgency down in 2007 by killing or capturing key leaders and clearing out Taliban safe havens, the report predicted that the Taliban would be back in 2008.","Pakistani forces launch major offensive against Taliban fighters in Khyber region .

"FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida (CNN) -- Richard Barboza sits behind the steering wheel, patiently working a crossword puzzle. There's no rush. Time is one thing Barboza has plenty of. Richard Barboza, left, and John Nilsen are among those struggling in the current economic recession. It's just after sun-up. The streaks of light shimmer off the car windows. In the back of the Ford Explorer John Nilsen stirs. This is home. Clothes are kept in a suitcase. Food is wherever they can find it. ""It's definitely not something that you ever see yourself being, homeless,"" Nilsen says. But homeless they have been for the past six weeks, ever since the money ran out and they were evicted from the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, apartment they shared. Nilsen had lost his job, and Barboza is waiting for disability checks to start arriving. The line of homeless men and women has already started to form at the food bank when the two men walk up. The faces are always the same, with a few more added every day. Michael is a regular. He makes grasshoppers out of palm fronds, then sells them when he can for whatever he can get. James says he once played professional football for the Miami Dolphins. No one believes him. Nilsen and Barboza wait quietly for their turn to get in the front door. ""There's a lot of emotional and mental turmoil when you're in a situation like this,"" Nilsen says. Breakfast at the Cooperative Feeding Program is rushed. There are so many to feed. Seats at the tables are a premium. Nilsen and Barboza eat quickly their meal of sausage patties, an orange wedge, some cake and coffee. They want to get moving. It's back in the car and off to the County Library. They can charge their cell phone there and use the public computers for an hour. Nilsen checks Facebook to see how his friends are doing That's how he stays in touch. The two men then begin searching for places to rent on Florida's West Coast. ""Big old double-wide trailer,"" Nilsen snickers. A two-bedroom catches their eyes. ""I like the location,"" whispers Nilsen, ""It's just north of Tarpon Springs."" If they can get enough money together, Barboza says they'd like to get out of Fort Lauderdale. ""After having spent 20 years here I'm due for a change anyway."" Nilsen agrees. ""We've agreed that we're going to go together, that we're going to stick together. We've been through enough as it is. It's easier to have someone you trust with you when you're in a situation like this."" In the afternoons, the two men try making a few bucks. Nilsen got $25 for participating in a food tasting. Barboza has an opportunity to be in a focus group that will pay him $75. Nilsen had been donating plasma twice a week, but now that he's homeless they can't use him anymore. Barboza made about $20 by panhandling on an Interstate 95 exit ramp for about an hour. He stopped after some other homeless men threatened to kill him for working their turf, he says. It's not easy finding work when your address is a license plate number. For Nilsen and Barboza, it's doubly difficult. Both men have disabilities. Barboza was injured in a car wreck. Nilsen had a blood clot in his right leg when he was 16. He walks with a limp and uses a cane. ""When we pull ourselves out of this,"" Nilsen says, ""it's gonna be something you can look back on and draw from and say, 'You know what, if I was able to get through that ...' "" The long days together living in a car don't allow for much space and not much alone time. ""We're at the point now when I know when not to say anything and he knows not to say anything. And he knows when I'm in a bad mood,"" Nilsen says with a laugh. ""He's got his strengths and weaknesses,"" adds Barboza, ""and I've got mine. We balance each other out."" By the time five o'clock rolls around, the two are getting hungry. There was no lunch today. A nearby church is serving dinner. It's time to stand in another line. They know most of the people here from breakfast at the Cooperative. Many are longtime homeless. ""If they know better than I do how to survive, then let me ask and let me get the knowledge I need to survive for however long it's gonna be,"" Nilsen says. Outside the church a van pulls up The homeless are handed bags of toiletries. You take what you can get because you don't know how long it's gonna be before you get more, Nilsen says. A sliver of a moon shines now. ""The toughest part of the day for us,"" Barboza says, ""is once it gets dark until we go to the place where we sleep at night."" For the next few hours the two men drive the neon sign-lit Fort Lauderdale streets. There are very few places, they say, where they can stop and park without police chasing them off. Once in a while they pull into a local park for a couple hours until the lights on the fields are turned off and the gates closed. At least here, they're not wasting gas. Every night is a challenge making it until 11 p.m., they say, when they can finally drive to their secret spot and bed down in the back of the old SUV.","Two men evicted from their apartment when their money ran out .

"(CNN) -- Luciano Pavarotti died Thursday at the age of 71 after suffering from pancreatic cancer.  I-Report contributors shared their memories of the famed opera tenor. Here is a selection of those stories: . Annamaria Capicchioni shared this snapshot from the 1993 Pavarotti San Marino Grand Prix in Modena, Italy. Leslie Oakley of Davenport, Florida I grew up in a small town in Kentucky where opera didn't exactly fit in the scheme of things. My family wasn't at all musical either but seeing as though I took an interest in it, my parents indulged me with opera recordings. One of the first ones I received was The Three Tenors. Luciano Pavarotti was to me what Michael Jordan was to other children. He was my hero. I even did a report on him one year in high school. I can remember sitting in my room listening to his voice, closing my eyes and seeing the operas unfold in my mind. He inspired me to teach myself to sing, and I went on to win awards in high school and to sing for three professional groups out of college. Singing has enriched my life immeasurably, and I owe it all to that beautiful voice that so entranced me as a child. I have many fond memories of Pavarotti. His voice always moves me to tears. It is the feeling of being given a glimpse of the divine that I will most remember about him. My prayers and thoughts are with his family and friends. There will never be another Pavarotti. Edmund Chua of Singapore Maestro's voice was truly a blessing. That exciting, that fascinating quality, that, sigh ... too many adjectives. Of course, there was that unforgettable personality. Personally, (don't know if this is a right thing to say but) I saw Italy in him, so to speak, always loving life. Knew he was fighting cancer but always thought he'd recover. I was hoping I'd be able to watch him live but I guess it'll only be in the footage. He's indeed a legend lost, a legacy remembered. ... We'll miss him. Tina Minges of Woodland, California I never cared for opera ... then I heard Pavarotti ... and from that point I loved it. Sandra Miser of Dallas, Texas I consider him the greatest singer ever. His voice had a quality like no others. I cried going to work this morning when I heard he was gone. When I listen to his music I can disappear into the beauty of it and be a peace. He will be greatly missed. Thank goodness for CDs so that we will never be without his voice. George Wendy of Eatons Neck, New York We had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Pavarotti sing a few times. His recital with James Levine at the Metropolitan Opera House was remarkable. I could not imagine feeling more emotion from listening to someone sing. Ciao, Luciano! Shannon Broussard of Springfield, Missouri Heaven now has a tenor for its choir. Chris Nissen of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania I heard Pavarotti perform twice in Philadelphia during the years he sponsored an operatic competition for young performers. I still have goose bumps thinking about the brilliance of those two evenings. Not only was his performance breathtaking, but his genuine joy in sharing the stage with the winners of the competition was obvious and written all over his face with a grand smile. Whenever I need to feel inspired with my own work I go and dig out my Pavarotti CDs. Bravo to the great one! Reynaldo O. Arcilla, Philippines  Even Mt. Etna wept when Luciano Pavarotti, one of the greatest opera singers of all time, died. Marelize, South Africa In the mid-'90s, Luciano Pavarotti came to South Africa and performed in the town of Stellenboch. It was a very exclusive open-air concert. The tickets were very expensive and all the rich and famous in South Africa were there. Next to the stadium is a river that runs through the town. On the night, crowds of people gathered along the banks of the river. Like me, they could not afford the concert. From where we stood we could see the beautiful mountains, see the lights of the stadium and we could not see him, but we could hear his amazing voice. I looked at the people around me, they all had an expression of sheer wonder on their faces. He gave us all a wonderful gift that night. I will never forget it! He made us fall in love with opera! Edgardo J. Tria Tirona, Philippines This great tenor's death is like the dimming of a star at the break of dawn. But, as in the final strains of Nessun Dorma ""All'alba vincero!"" - at daybreak, he [again] conquers! The world's loss is now heaven's gain. Barry, New York City As a former employee of the New York Metropolitan Opera, it was my pleasure and ""thrill of a lifetime"" to watch and listen to ""the Maestro"" sing from the wings of the stage. I still get goose bumps thinking about that glorious voice, golden tenor. Ozonato, Kuala Lumpur Luciano Pavarotti's death was a shock, I attended his concerts in Hong Kong (SAR) 2005. Wife Nicoletta Mantovani [and his] daughters should have courage to bear the loss. I like the power of his strength of music. He was famous during his lifetime, may he rest in the Lord. Mario Rizzotti of Lincolnwood, Illinois ARRIVEDERCI GRANDE LUCIANO!!!!!! In your honor all the opera houses in USA should have the Half-Staff Flag. Sei stato grande. Your Italian Friends that fell in love with your singing and used your singing to make ladies fall in love, will always remember you. Now you rest in peace you can say:"" VINCEROOOOOOOOO.""

"(CNN) -- For actress Kyra Sedgwick, it's the public's approval that makes it worth being away from her family for six months to tape her critically acclaimed series ""The Closer."" Kyra Sedgwick and her husband, Kevin Bacon, at the 66th annual Golden Globe Awards this month. But she may be getting more approval from her peers, too. Sedgwick will walk the red carpet again Sunday night at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, where she is nominated for a fourth consecutive year for outstanding performance by a female actor in a drama series for her role as Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson. She's also won a Golden Globe for her performance, in 2007. The TNT series resumes Monday night where it left off in September with what Sedgwick called ""a fantastic five episodes."" (TNT is a unit of Time Warner, as is CNN.) ""I said to the writers, 'I really want a lot of personal stuff for Brenda,' "" Sedgwick said. ""I feel like there's some of those personal quiet moments with her alone, is something that I've been missing as an actor, and I feel like the audience has been missing, too. ""She is such a complicated, fascinating character, and watching her growth and lack of growth is something that is really interesting,"" she said. When CNN asked whether the new episodes might include a wedding for her character, Sedgwick laughed. ""That might very well happen,"" she said. ""That's pretty insightful of you. I'm just going to just say that."" A marriage for Brenda Johnson would be ""a complicated, difficult situation,"" she said, because ""she's basically married to her work."" Sedgwick's job also complicates her real-life marriage to Bacon, since the show is produced in Los Angeles and the couple lives in Connecticut with their two children. That's where the approval -- whether on the street from fans or at award shows -- has ""been a wonderful phenomenon for me,"" she said. ""On a personal level, that's really good for me, because I really miss my family when I'm working on the show six months in L.A.,"" she said. ""As much as I try to get my kids to move to L.A. and my husband, they just wouldn't have it. ""It's challenging, and I'm glad that people are watching, because otherwise it would be kind of hard to go to work,"" Sedgwick said. Sedgwick has moved into an executive producer's role on the show, which she said she expects to continue for at least two more years. ""I love being with a group where there's not a power struggle,"" she said. ""I have a lot of say, and I always have. And that feels really good.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Several hundred Sri Lankan Tamil protesters shouted slogans at the British Parliament for a second day Tuesday, urging it to act to end the ""genocide"" against their people in Sri Lanka. Police clash with Tamil protesters outside the Houses of Parliament. ""Stop the genocide!"" they shouted. ""Stop the war!"" They waved the red flag of Tamil Eelam, the Tamils' traditional homeland in northern and eastern Sri Lanka. The flag is emblazoned with a yellow roaring tiger. Most of the protesters slept overnight on the streets around Parliament Square after beginning their unauthorized protest Monday afternoon. At one point, the protesters blocked the street leading to Westminster Bridge over the River Thames, police said. That led to road closures around Parliament. By Tuesday morning, a solid ring of police had hemmed the protesters in Parliament Square across the street from the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben. Roads were open again, but the protest and police presence caused traffic congestion in the area. Hariram Shan, 24, is a Sri Lankan Tamil who said he has lived in Britain for six years. He said the protesters hope the British government will intervene to stop Sri Lanka's crackdown on Tamil Tiger rebels, which he said harms civilians. ""They can force economic sanctions,"" Shan told CNN. Dushyanthy Sukumar, 47, said the Sri Lankan government is retaliating against innocent civilians. ""The Sri Lankan government has now cornered the rebels, the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam), and what they are doing is killing the people,"" she said. Sukumar, who said she has lived in Britain since leaving her homeland in 1987, said she is angry at the British government for supporting Sri Lanka. ""The Sri Lankan government is doing their dirty work through this government,"" she said. The Sri Lankan military said Sunday that it had captured the last rebel stronghold and killed five rebel leaders after three days of gunbattles. It said more rebels could still be hiding in a 20-square-kilometer ""safety zone,"" but that it would not enter the area because it is home to some 50,000 people. The Tamil Tigers have fought since 1983 for an independent homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority. The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead.","Several hundred Tamil protesters demonstrate outside UK parliament .

"Iceland's new prime minister wants her country to join the European Union and adopt the euro as its official currency to help lift the Nordic nation from financial ruin, a spokesman said Tuesday. Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir took office earlier this week. The announcement by Johanna Sigurdardottir, 66, came just two days after she was sworn in as prime minister and a week after the Cabinet resigned in the fallout from Iceland's financial collapse. She is Iceland's first female prime minister and the world's first openly gay leader. Iceland has been in political turmoil since October, when its currency, stock market and leading banks crashed amid the global financial crisis. The island nation's Nordic neighbors sent billions of dollars to prop up the economy, as did the International Monetary Fund in its first intervention to support a Western European democracy in decades. Sigurdardottir touted EU membership at a joint news conference Tuesday with Finance Minister Steingrimur Sigfusson, whose Left-Green Movement teamed up with the prime minister's Social Democratic Alliance to form the new two-party minority government. The Alliance party was until recently the only movement in Iceland's five-party parliament to push EU membership as a viable way to rescue Iceland's suffering economy. However, Sigfusson and his party aren't convinced that the country should join the EU's 27 other members. Instead, he said he is considering a monetary union with Norway, meaning Iceland would adopt the Norwegian krone as its currency. Iceland's newly instated minority government will only be in power for 80 days and elections are scheduled for April 25. Until then, no decisions about the country possibly joining the European Union will be made -- though the question could be important during the elections, Sigurdardottir's spokesman, Kristjan Kristjansson, said. CNN's Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","No decision on joining EU will be made before April elections .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano apologized Friday for a department assessment that suggested returning combat veterans could be recruited by right-wing extremist groups. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano says she offered her ""sincere apologies for any offense."" She met with American Legion National Commander David Rehbein at Homeland Security headquarters. ""The secretary started the meeting with an apology to me personally, to the American Legion and to the entire veterans community,"" Rehbein told reporters after the meeting. In a statement issued by the department, Napolitano said, ""We connected meaningfully about the important issues that have emerged over recent days, and I offered him my sincere apologies for any offense to our veterans caused by this report. ... I pledge that the department has fixed the internal process that allowed this document to be released before it was ready."" The report was an unclassified assessment sent to law enforcement agencies. It was titled ""Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment."" The mention of combat veterans surfaced on a conservative radio program earlier this month, and it drew the scorn of commentators and conservative members of Congress. Rep. John Carter, R -Texas, called on Napolitano to resign. Rehbein said Friday it is time to move forward. ""In the mind of the American Legion, I think her apology was sufficient,"" he said. ""The way the Vietnam veterans were treated once they came home, that's what drives the sensitivity to this, because those things start small and then grow from there, and we need to make sure anytime something like that happens we need to step on that and make sure it goes away very quickly.""","Homeland Security report says veterans could be recruited by right-wing extremists .

"(CNN) -- Nursing school seemed like a good idea to Tracy Kidd, but not just because she was interested in medicine. Tracy Kidd, 37, just started nursing school. Nurses are high in demand, despite the souring economy. Kidd, 37, and her husband recently took a massive pay cut -- the painting business they own in Mesa, Arizona, once brought in about $70,000 a month. Now they're lucky to get $800 a month. They have moved in with Tracy's father because their house was foreclosed on. ""I knew that nurses are always needed, and I didn't want what just happened to us to ever happen again,"" said Kidd, who started a licensed practical nurse (LPN) program two weeks ago that will allow her to work while finishing her registered nurse (RN) degree. Kidd's logic squares with the numbers: While industries such as manufacturing have had decreasing job openings, there continues to be a deep need for health care positions such as nurses, physician assistants, pharmacists and primary-care physicians.  See how health job openings compare with other industries » . With the unemployment rate at 8.1 percent and thousands of Americans getting laid off every day, the employment landscape looks bleak. But some experts say there are many job opportunities in the health care sector. Nursing . The number of nurses usually goes up when the economy goes down, said Beverly Malone, CEO of the National League for Nursing. Irrespective of this recession, the number of nurses has been growing anyway because of high demand. Nearly 182,000 new students in 2006-2007 entered prelicensure RN programs, which prepare students to sit for the RN licensing exam, according to the National League for Nursing. This represents a 9 percent increase over the previous year. There are about 2.9 million nurses eligible to practice, with 2.6 million in the workforce, she said. As of May 2007, a registered nurse in the United States earned on average $62,480 per year, according to the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. View a map of jobs and unemployment in the U.S. At the associates level, a student usually takes at least two years to earn a degree, while a Bachelor of Science in Nursing takes at least four years. Nurse educators are in huge demand, in part because they earn less than practicing nurses, Malone said. A master's degree is required for these positions, and sometimes a doctorate. Physician assistants . Jobs for physician assistants have also stayed steady, as these medical practitioners help offset the national physician shortage, said Cindy Lord, president of the American Academy of Physician Assistants. Like doctors, physician assistants see patients individually, diagnose conditions, and in some cases even write prescriptions. They must at least have telecommunication with a physician, because they are technically working in a team. Employment for physician assistants is projected to grow much faster than average because health care institutions increasingly use these practitioners to contain costs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Rural and inner-city clinics are especially good for job opportunities, the bureau said. The average salary for a new graduate from a physician assistant program -- which takes an average of 27 months to complete -- is $75,000 to $80,000 per year, she said. Those who have been practicing longer or specialize in specific fields earn around $90,000, she said. To get into a program, many schools require at least two years of college and some health care experience, and college-level biology, chemistry and math courses are sometimes necessary before matriculation. Visit CNNhealth.com, your connection to better living . Satisfaction with the profession is high -- one survey found that 88 percent of physician assistants would choose that career again, Lord said. ""I would do this over a hundred times,"" she said. ""The privilege and honor of practicing medicine is very rewarding."" The hospital scene . Hospitals say they are still hiring, although there are fewer openings now than normally. Massachusetts General Hospital has fewer vacancies now than at any point in the last 10 years, as well as the lowest turnover, said Jeff Davis, senior vice president of human resources. That's because people who have jobs don't want to leave them, he said. Still, there are about 400 openings available at the hospital, which has about 20,000 workers including physicians. Nursing jobs are available, and the more skill a job requires, the more it's in demand at Mass General, he said. People looking to change careers can take accreditation courses to become X-ray technologists or professionals involved in patient care, but the more skills you can get, the better, Davis said. With the population of Massachusetts aging, more people are likely to utilize the health care system. Davis said he would encourage people to become registered nurses or physical therapists in response to that demand. The UCLA Health System in Los Angeles, California, has fewer openings than last year or the year before, but is still hiring, said Robin Ludewig, director of recruitment. Some of these positions do not require much formalized training. Positions in demand include clinical lab scientists, which requires a four-year degree and an internship. Sterile processing technicians, who prepare surgical equipment, are also needed, and can get training in community colleges. ""It doesn't really matter how the economy is. People still get ill,"" she said. For anyone interested in changing careers to health care, experts recommend exploring courses at local community colleges and vocational schools. Some schools offer short courses in medical terminology to get things started. With talk of reforming the health care system, it is uncertain how those changes would affect the health care job market. Still, there will always be a need for skilled individuals to practice medicine, experts said. A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll showed that 9 percent of Americans think health care is the most important issue facing the country. The telephone poll of 1,019 adults had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. As for nursing student Kidd, she says she's optimistic about her future, and recognizes that life has its ebbs and flows. ""We just happen to have caught ourselves in a bad situation,"" she said. ""My husband and I, we're not stupid people. We just really were victims of the economy.""","Despite recession, there continues to be a deep need for health care workers .

"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- A new boatload of Rohingya refugees washed up on the shores of Thailand early Tuesday, raising questions about the type of treatment they would receive. Male refugees show scars they say were caused by beatings at the hands of the Myanmar navy. The boat was carrying about 78 people, Thai police said, and many had severe burns from a fire that broke out on board. Most were members of neighboring Myanmar's Rohingya minority, which has been fleeing persecution by the country's hard-line government for years. Other members of the Rohingya have allegedly been abandoned at sea after being rounded up by Thai authorities. A recent CNN investigation found evidence that the Thai military towed hundreds of refugees into open waters only to abandon them. CNN obtained several photos of this activity including one photo that shows the Thai army towing a boatload of some 190 refugees far out to sea. CNN also interviewed a refugee who said he was one of the few that survived after his group of six rickety boats were towed back to sea and abandoned by Thai authorities in January.  Watch Dan Rivers' BackStory on the investigation » . The Thai army has denied this allegation, while the Thai government has launched an inquiry. But one source in the Thai military, after extensive questioning, did confirm to CNN that the Thai army was operating a dump-at-sea policy. The source defended it, insisting that each boatload of refugees was given sufficient supplies of food and water. That source claimed local villagers had become afraid of the hundreds of Rohingya arriving each month, accusing the refugees of stealing their property and threatening them. That source claimed local villagers had become afraid of the hundreds of Rohingya arriving each month, and that they were accusing the refugees of stealing their property and threatening them. The Rohingya, a minority in Myanmar, have been fleeing their country in make-shift boats for years in search of a better life, and maintain that they are fleeing persecution by the regime in Myanmar, formerly Burma. The Thai government maintains that ""there are no reasonable grounds to believe"" that the Rohingya are fleeing Myanmar out of fear of persecution. ""Their profile and their seasonal travel further support the picture that they are illegal migrants, and not those requiring international protection,"" it said in a statement released Tuesday by the foreign ministry. In that statement, the Thai government maintained that its policies in dealing with all illegal migrants are in accordance with its laws and international guidelines. It said ""basic humanitarian needs"" are given to the migrants before they are returned home. ""We have upheld our humanitarian tradition and ensured that new arrivals are adequately provided with food, water and medicines, with necessary repairs to their boats,"" the ministry's statement said. The government noted that Thailand has already been inundated with as many as 20,000 illegal migrants -- most of them Rohingyas -- and ""accepting those arriving in an irregular manner would simply encourage new arrivals."" The government ""categorically denied"" media reports blaming Thai authorities for mistreating the illegal migrants, and intentionally damaging their boats. It said it would seriously investigate such cases if any ""concrete evidence"" is presented. -- CNN's Dan Rivers and Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","The latest boat was carrying about 78 people, Thai police say .

"CNN -- When Maria Rubeo closed her arm, she felt something ""very big -- like a lemon."" Although Hispanic women have a lower incidence rate for breast cancer, they often get the diagnosis at later stages. Her doctor said the lump in her breast was nothing, so Rubeo, who didn't have health insurance, didn't seek a second opinion. With two jobs and two kids, she was busy and didn't go to the doctor's office for another year. During her next visit, with a different doctor, Rubeo learned she had breast cancer -- and the tumor had been there for a while. Her story may not be particularly rare. Research suggests that breast cancer may be harder to treat in Hispanic women because they wait longer to receive care. Women in the fastest-growing minority group in the United States face issues such as language and cultural barriers, lifestyle choices and lack of insurance that could affect their health and medical care, according to research released Wednesday at the Science of Cancer Health Disparities Conference. Like Rubeo, about half of women in a study of 230 Mexican-American breast cancer patients in Arizona and Texas noticed changes in their breasts, but waited more than a month to seek medical attention, according to research presented at the conference hosted by the American Association for Cancer Research. ""We asked what the reasons were,"" said Rachel Zenuk, a graduate student at the University of Arizona Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health, who spoke about the study.  ""A third cited they didn't have insurance or were unable to afford medical care. Or they thought it was not important to report the medical finding to a professional."" Other factors included fear of the results and difficulty scheduling an appointment, she said. More than a decade after her mastectomy, Rubeo urges Hispanic women in the San Francisco, California, Bay area not to wait after seeing changes in their breasts. ""I explain: Take time for you to see the doctor,"" she said. ""[Some women] don't have insurance, don't speak English, it's very difficult."" Hispanics are the largest U.S. minority group, constituting 14 percent of the nation's total population. While Hispanic women have a lower incidence rate for breast cancer than whites, blacks and Asians, they have a less favorable prognosis because of delayed treatment. ""They're not getting more breast cancer than other women, but they're less likely to survive as long,"" said Dr. Amelie G. Ramirez, a member of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation's National Health Advisory Council and chairwoman of the Komen Foundation National Hispanic/Latino Advisory Council.  ""The reason is they're diagnosed at a later stage of the cancer."" ""We're seeing them at later stages, so the cancer is more advanced. Their five-year survival rates are lower than non-Hispanic whites,"" Ramirez said. Data also showed that about two-thirds of breast cancer cases in the 230 Mexican-American women were found through self-detection, which suggests that the women were not receiving routine mammogram or exams. Rubeo said that when she first noticed the lump, she ""had no time for me to take care of myself. Only work, work, running, no time to eat. Sometimes you forget yourself, so there's time for everybody and not enough for yourself."" At the Latina Breast Cancer Agency in San Francisco, she tells other women how she didn't take care of herself while working two jobs, 16 hours a day. ""I explain to the ladies my experience. Sometimes they cry and say it's true,"" Rubeo said. She now runs support groups for breast cancer patients, talking about health screenings, accompanying women to the hospital and helping them with paperwork. Aside from the pressures of being a busy, working mother, there are language and cultural barriers for Latina women. ""For women we work with, our focus is breast health,"" said Olivia Fé, founder and executive director of the Latina Breast Cancer Agency. ""Within Latino culture, within family, the husband doesn't want the wife to see a male doctor. ... That is a big deal."" The group partnered with public hospitals in San Francisco and San Mateo counties and made sure the medical staff who work with Hispanic breast cancer patients are female and speak Spanish. Hispanic women don't take advantage of the free breast health screenings, because there's a lack of awareness, Fé said.  Many women speak only Spanish, so prevention messages in English don't get through. Research showed that the women with more education and exposure to English-language media, such as television and radio, were more likely to have had a mammogram. Ramirez said there are now public service announcements in Spanish that target Hispanic women of all ages, so the younger ones will know the importance of family history and the older ones will become informed about the importance of mammograms. The Komen Foundation funds local efforts to increase enrollment of Hispanic women in clinical trials, provide medical interpretive and transportation services, and have Spanish peer support for 24-hour breast cancer hotlines. Lifestyle choices have an important role in breast cancer development, said Esther John, a research scientist and epidemiologist at the Northern California Cancer Center. One study that examined 2,533 Hispanic women found that the women born in foreign countries had 50 percent less risk of developing breast cancer than women born in the United States. This San Francisco Bay Area Breast Cancer Study compared the known breast cancer risks such as obesity, use of hormones, alcohol consumption, fat intake and lack of physical activity between the two groups and found women born in the United States had greater risk. ""The pattern suggests that when Hispanic women move to the U.S., there are important changes from the traditional lifestyle to the Americanized lifestyle,"" John said.  ""There are lifestyle factors that increase risks of breast cancer.""","Hispanic women learn of breast cancer at later stages, research shows .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Picture this: The European champions and current highest-ranked soccer team in the world, Spain, are beaten 3-0...by a team of robots. On the way: Robots are developing steadily towards the goal of beating humans at football. It may sound ridiculous, but robot developers in Asia, the U.S. and Europe are dreaming of that very goal. Working under the umbrella organizations FIRA (Federation of Robot-Soccer Association) and the RoboCup Federation, researchers and developers are aiming to advance robot technology to the point that a team of humanoids can beat the best humans in the sport by 2050. Since robot soccer competitions began in the mid-1990s, researchers have already made significant developments towards their goal. Phil Culverhouse of the Center for Robotics and Intelligent Systems at the University of Plymouth told CNN that the first robots in competition were controlled by humans and many were on wheels or four-legged, but that is changing. ""Since 2007 the team have progressed to bipedal robots that have cameras on board,"" he said. ""Our robots are autonomous -- they have no control from outside sources. The cameras try to work out where the goal is, where the ball is and where the other players are."" Further robotic developments appear to be close. Researchers at Carlos III University of Madrid released a study in the March 2009 online edition of 'Expert Systems with Applications,' showing they had refined a technique known as machine-learning. Basically, the scientists were able to teach a virtual player simple reactions to visual stimuli -- based upon how real humans react in the same situation. Do you think robots will one day be able to beat humans at football? Sound Off box below. This year robots will go head-to-head at both the RoboCup event in Austria in June/July and the FIRA RoboWorld Cup in Korea in August. The most advanced classes at present are the bipedal classes for 'humanoid' robots. Co-chair of RoboCup 2009, Gerald Steinbauer, told CNN this year's event was the 13th edition of the cup, and he was impressed by progress by advances since the competitions began. ""At the last RoboCup in China 2008 we had games of teams of three humanoid playing attractive soccer. They walk on two feet, fight for the ball and of course score... so we are approaching the goal,"" he said. Culverhouse said interest in both events had steadily grown, especially since the two-legged robots had been introduced. This year up to 3,000 competitors from 40 countries are expected at RoboCup. ""This has been extremely effective in gaining interest. These are much more exciting to watch. We have seen a steep level of change in interest from not just young people but everybody."" Despite the increasing profile, Culverhouse said there are still plenty of major challenges before the humanoids can seriously compete with humans. ""This is still a long way from competing against humans. The next big challenge to be met is to get robots walking like humans and then running like humans. ""One of the most challenging things is getting a robot to walk on uneven terrain without falling over,"" he said, explaining that some fall over after kicking at goal. (Although, it's not hard to think of professional footballers who have suffered the same problem.) The University of Plymouth team is currently researching how robot's feet can be improved, and hope to release a concept later this year that could usher in a new era of in foot design. For Steinbauer, the critical issues are that of perception and cognitive abilities. ""Perception is one of our major problems. It is important that a robot is able to understand a scene like a human does. If you enter a complete unknown room you are able to recognize the important things like furniture and also relations and functions of objects very fast,"" he said. ""Despite huge progress in this area we are far behind the capabilities of animals or humans. ""And of course there's cognitive capabilities. To reason about new, uncertain or even inconsistent facts is easy for a human but very hard for a robot,"" Steinbauer said. Size and cost are other limiting issues. ""In order to make this affordable we are developing robots 50 to 60 centimeters high. At that size each robot costs about 10,000 pounds to make. At full human size each would cost about 50,000 pounds,"" Culverhouse said. Soccer is an ideal testing ground for robotics as it encompasses many different elements including movement, vision and strategy, Steinbauer said. But the applications developed in these robots could serve a greater purpose. Steinbauer said robot technologies could be used for entertainment or performing simple tasks around the home and office. They also could be used in rescue scenarios -- where robots could be sent into dangerous situations in place of humans, he said.","FIRA and RoboCup organizations promoting development of robots .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Chelsea and England defender Ashley Cole has apologized to London police for a foul-mouthed tirade that led to him being arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct in the early hours of Thursday morning. Ashley Cole, pictured signing an autograph at a charity event in London Wednesday. In a statement released by the left-back, Cole said he swore out of his frustration with the paparazzi and insisted he would never disrespect the police. However, Cole admits he did not heed their warnings to calm down and regrets not taking their advice. He also made it clear that he had not consumed a vast amount of alcohol. Cole declared: ""I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to the police officers on duty last night for my language. ""I felt I was being harassed by paparazzi and while complaining to the police about this at the scene they did warn me to calm down, a warning that I regrettably did not heed. ""I fully appreciate that whatever frustrations I may have had with others that it was completely inappropriate to vent those in conversations with the police. ""However, I do want to make clear that I swore in frustration at the paparazzi's behavior. I would never disrespect police officers in anyway. ""I take very seriously my responsibilities as a professional footballer, this includes keeping my body in the best condition. Although I had consumed some alcohol earlier in the evening on a night out with friends it had not been excessive. ""But I accept that the language I used on this occasion was wrong. I regret my actions and how it reflects on myself and Chelsea Football Club."" The 28-year-old was arrested in Brompton Road in the upmarket west London area of South Kensington, close to Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground, at about 2.15am on Thursday morning after emerging from the Collection nightclub. Police sources said the officers were already on patrol in the street and were not called to any disorder. One source denied reports they were following up a complaint from a photographer over an alleged bust-up with Cole. Cole was taken to a central London police station and issued with an £80 fixed penalty notice for being drunk and disorderly before being released shortly after 5.30am. Cole is likely to be fined by Chelsea. Before his arrest, Cole had joined Chelsea's first-team squad and more than 300 charity workers, celebrities and supporters for the second annual Chelsea FC and Armani charity fundraiser. Cole, who previously played for Arsenal before joining Chelsea in 2006, is married to the Girls Aloud singer and reality TV judge Cheryl Cole, who is currently on a charity climb on Tanzania's Mount Kilimanjaro.","Chelsea defender Ashley Cole apologizes after his arrest on Thursday morning .

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- Watching the news out of Mexico is causing a case of déjà vu for Dr. Lo Wing-Luk. The sight of people wearing masks became common in Hong Kong after the SARS outbreak of 2003. ""Seeing the people in masks today reminds me of Hong Kong during SARS,"" said Lo, an epidemiology expert who was among those on the frontline during the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong in 2003, which within three months infected 8,000 and killed nearly 800 in Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and Toronto. Historically, Hong Kong has been center stage for recent infections that threatened to spiral across the world, such as SARS and Avian Influenza, which first struck and killed people here in 1997. Southern China -- with the close proximity of its rural agriculture to population centers and globally connected transportation -- has been an ideal conduit for past animal diseases that spread to humans and then to the rest of the world. But with the outbreak of swine flu in Mexico and the United States, Hong Kong suddenly finds the world looking to it for lessons on how to stop the spread of disease. ""Managing a (potential) pandemic can't be from the top down, it must be from the ground up,"" said Lo, a former Hong Kong legislator representing the medical community. In the early days of SARS, cooperation was lax between Hong Kong health officials and public officials across the border in mainland China, where the live animal wet markets in Guangdong province is suspected in the virus' jump to humans. ""One of the most important lesson of SARS was the importance of good communication,"" says Dr. KY Yuen, head of the microbiology department of Hong Kong University, which found the first human cases of Avian Influenza in 1997 and first identified SARS in 2003. ""There were outbreaks in the middle to late November in Guangdong Province, but the first cases were reported in Hong Kong three months later,"" he said. ""We could have reduced the impact (of SARS) if there had been better communication"" between Hong Kong and mainland China health authorities. The communication channels have improved between China and Hong Kong, health officials said, as well as better surveillance of the disease. Every visitor who comes through Hong Kong International Airport now is scanned by infrared monitors and immediately isolated if suffering from a fever or respiratory illness. ""Quarantine and isolation of people (suspected to be ill) is crucial now,"" Yuen said. As the disease spreads, there is a conflict between the need for a quick response and the time required for appropriate scientific study -- which can result in some bad decisions, Yuen said. For example, in the case of SARS health experts wore full-body protection suits because of initial hunches the disease was being spread by airborne causes. More people were exposed to the disease because of the harried medical staff's improper use of the cumbersome equipment. ""It turned out globes, masks and hand washing were far more effective"" than a breathing apparatus, Yuen said. ""Presumptions are dangerous,"" he added. If Hong Kong is any example, governments who fail to meet the challenges of an outbreak will face rising public heat. In July 2003, half a million Hong Kong residents took to the streets to protest the government, in part because of frustrations over the response to the SARS outbreak, says Cecilia Chan, director of the Center of Behavioral Health at Hong Kong University -- adding to the woes of the already beleaguered administration of former Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee Wah, who later stepped down in the middle of his second five-year appointment.","Hong Kong at center of recent infections that threatened to spiral across world .

"(CNN) -- Sri Lanka ordered an end to combat operations against Tamil Tiger rebels in the country's north, the president's office said Monday. But the rebels accused the military of continuing to bomb civilians. Sri Lankan soldiers stand guard next to a tank captured from the Tamil Tigers. ""Our security forces have been instructed to end the use of heavy-caliber guns, combat aircraft and aerial weapons which could cause civilian casualties,"" according a statement from the Presidential Secretariat. A rebel Web site, Tamilnet.com, immediately accused the government of violating its own order and ""deceiving the international community."" ""Two Sri Lanka air force fighter bombers continued to bomb civilian targets in Mu'l'li-vaaykkaal after the announcement by the Sri Lankan forces that it would not deploy heavy weapons or carry out air attacks,"" Tamilnet said, citing S. Puleedevan, director of the Tamil Peace Secretariat. ""Obviously we need to see what that means in practice,"" John Holmes, the head of U.N. humanitarian operations, said about the government announcement to end combat operations. ""But, on the face of it, I think it's good news."" The military will now concentrate on ""saving"" and ""rescuing civilians,"" who have been caught in the fighting between government forces and rebel fighters, the presidential statement said. The government's decision followed an unscheduled meeting of the National Security Council called by President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The session included the commanders of the army, navy and air force. The developments came a day after Sri Lankan officials rejected a proposed cease-fire from the Tamil rebels, warning instead that government troops would continue a new offensive until the group surrendered, a senior government official told CNN. ""The government is firm that (the rebels) lay down their arms and surrender. We do not recognize this so-called offer,"" said Lakshman Hulugalle, director of Sri Lanka's Media Center for National Security. The Tiger leadership had asked the international community to ""pressure the Sri Lankan government to reciprocate"" on the cease-fire offer. The United States, the United Nations, the European Union and India have called for a cease-fire. The foreign ministers of three nations are due in Sri Lanka on Wednesday -- David Miliband of the United Kingdom, Bernard Kouchner of France and Carl Bildt of Sweden. The rebels' proposed cease-fire came six days after the Sri Lankan army launched a new offensive against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE). Government troops made significant advances into rebel-held territory on Friday and Saturday, according to Sri Lankan army sources. A government-imposed deadline for the Tigers to surrender passed last Tuesday. Tens of thousands of displaced civilians currently remain wedged in a dwindling swath of territory controlled by the Tigers along the country's northeastern coast. Government troops say they have rescued 39,000 civilians trapped in the area, but a U.N. refugee agency said Friday that a wave of ""fresh displacement"" now exceeds 100,000 people.  Watch civilians describe what they are experiencing » . Fifty metric tons of relief supplies -- which landed in Colombo on Monday -- will be sent by UNICEF to the north to help displaced residents. UNICEF, which called the situation in the north a ""catastrophe for children,"" said the displaced lack food, water and basic medical supplies. The rebels estimate the number of civilians still located in the territory at more than 160,000. The Sri Lankan military said it ""freed 3,254 civilians from LTTE clutches"" in operations Sunday. The Tigers have been fighting for an independent state in Sri Lanka's northeast since 1983. As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began, and the group has been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries, including the United States and the European Union.","Tamil rebels say Sri Lankan forces ignoring orders to end military operations  Sri Lanka: Forces ordered to cease use of heavy-caliber guns, combat aircraft   Rebels say fighter bombers continued to bomb civilian targets after announcement .

"(CNN) -- Amber Easton has gone from $80,000 a year in salary to scrambling for work. At a time in her life when she should be scaling the corporate ladder, she has instead spiraled into a deep depression. She recently lost her car and now faces eviction from her apartment. Job fairs have been on the rise amid the nation's hard economic times. Just last week, the 35-year-old longtime working professional attended two job fairs with friends in the Detroit area. They stood in line for over three hours with hundreds of professionals of all types. ""It was a real eye-opener to see the caliber of people we were in line with -- very educated with vast skill sets,"" Easton said in an e-mail. ""Afterwards, we went to the restaurant located in the same hotel and it was filled with unemployed professionals sharing their story, from engineers to graphic designers to marketing professionals."" Easton's saga began in July 2007 when she traded in her job as a corporate compliance officer to attend law school, what she thought would help advance her career. But after a year of law school, she decided it wasn't for her. By then, her old job was gone and the job market had shrunk. ""It's hard not to be depressed during a time like this,"" she wrote iReport.com. ""I never imagined in a million years that I would be in such a situation at my age and at this point in my career. I am humiliated. I am praying for everyone else out there is who are facing the same problems."" She has applied to 70 different companies but gotten few leads. She recently went through a rigorous interview process for one job in another state, but to no avail. Share your economic survivor story . Every day, she searches for new job possibilities and every day results in more desperation. She estimates she's making $20,000 -- ""if that"" -- as a contract employee working from her home. ""I just haven't made enough to keep up."" Her Detroit neighborhood a couple years ago was booming, she said, but now ""it's like a ghost town around here."" ""It's bad everywhere, but it's so, so bad here,"" she said. Across the nation, people like Easton are feeling the pinch. Good jobs have evaporated. Former full-time employees are now working part-time contract positions just to get by. Nearly 2.6 million jobs were lost during 2008, the highest yearly total since the end of World War II in 1945. This week alone, major corporations have announced more than 80,000 job cuts, bringing this year's total to well over 200,000. Dr. Rosalind Dorlen is a clinical psychologist in Summit, New Jersey, an area she calls a ""Wall Street ghetto"" where formerly high-flying executives are out of work. ""Here, the people earn millions of dollars with bonuses that are astronomical,"" said Dorlen, who is also the public education coordinator in New Jersey for the American Psychological Association. ""There is a demoralizing aspect to having a huge salary and a huge bonus and then having to look for a job that is going to pay much, much less."" She added, ""What I'm hearing is a terrible sense of betrayal, anxiety and people experiencing lots of stress."" That, in turn, can lead to an increase in unhealthy coping behaviors, such as an uptick in alcohol consumption, unhealthy eating and worse sleeping habits. Dorlen has several tips for people out of work: . • Don't panic; . • Find a support group, even if it's just an informal group of friends; . • Seek employment counseling when available; . • Be professional in your job hunt; . • Network with other professionals; . • Take time to exercise during hard times; . • Spend valuable time with your family. On a practical note, she said people should contact their creditors to let them know the situation. She also advises people to do volunteer work and to cultivate a ""spirit of optimism."" ""Bad times pass, and it's sometimes hard to see that when you're in the throes of a terrible place,"" she said. ""I think we do need to hold onto a spirit of optimism and a sense of confidence."" See Top companies: They're hiring! ""I think we're getting mired in the gloom and doom, and we need to hold on to the fact that lots of people are working.""

In Delaware, Manoj Philip, 24, said he had a full-time job in 2007 with Agilent Technologies making about $55,000 a year, including all the perks and benefits that came with it. But in July 2007, he quit that job to pursue a career in real estate. ""I knew it wasn't going to be easy, but I didn't think it would be this tough,"" he said. By September 2008, Philip needed a second income because of the withering housing market. He picked up a full-time contracting job and continues to do real estate about 20-30 hours per week. It was a shock, he said, to return to full-time work while putting his real estate dreams on hold. ""It took a lot for me to change that mental outlook. Because before I would've thought of it as something holding me back,"" Philip said. ""But I don't look at it like that anymore."" He's since learned the value of living within his means, budgeting and making every dollar he spends count for something. ""These are really important lessons to learn. I'm glad I learned it at such a young age."" In Detroit, Easton said she knows America will bounce back at some point, but ""in the meantime, people are losing everything.""

"(CNN) -- World number one Rafael Nadal continues to prove unbeatable on his favorite clay-court surface, as he won his fifth Barcelona Open title in a row with a straight sets victory over fellow-Spaniard David Ferrer on Sunday. Rafael Nadal lifts the massive Barcelona Open trophy for the fifth year in a row after his win over David Ferrer. The 22-year-old Nadal, who last week secured his fifth Monte Carlo title in succession, repeated that feat on home soil by winning 6-2 7-5 in a repeat of the 2008 final. The victory gave Nadal his 35th career title (24 of them coming on clay) and meant the Barcelona tournament was won by a home player for a seventh straight year. ""I could have never have imagined that I would win here for a fifth time,"" a beaming Nadal said after the match. ""Congratulations to David also. Even if it was impossible for him to win today, he had a great tournament. For me, this is much more than a dream,"" he added. Nadal will have no time to celebrate as he heads directly for the Rome Masters which begins on Monday. Last year, an obviously exhausted Nadal lost in his opening match to compatriot Juan Carlos Ferrero.","Rafael Nadal defeats David Ferrer in straight sets to lift Barcelona Open title .

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Friday he appreciated U.S. President Barack Obama's friendly gestures at last weekend's Summit of the Americas, but said they don't change his view of the United States as an imperialist nation. Hugo Chavez had handshakes and smiles for President Obama at the Summit of the Americas last weekend. Chavez's fiery diatribes against the United States have included referring to former President George W. Bush as the devil. He was photographed with Obama at least twice at the summit -- once when Obama shook hands with him and other leaders, and again when he approached Obama to give him a book. ""The hand[shake], yes. And the smile, yes -- one time and a second time and a third time and a fourth time,"" Chavez said during a televised address. ""But nobody should be mistaken. The empire is there, alive and kicking."" The book Chavez presented to Obama as cameras rolled is titled ""Open Veins of Latin America: Five Centuries of the Pillage of a Continent."" The book chronicles Europe's and the United States' role in ""the effects and causes of capitalist underdevelopment in Latin America,"" according to one reviewer. As he has in the past, Chavez noted Obama's historic role as the first black U.S. president. ""I hope Obama, for the dignity of his race, may be the last president of an imperialist United States,"" he said.","Venezuelan president in TV interview: [U.S.] ""empire is there, alive and kicking""

"(CNN) -- Carl Edwards, one of NASCAR's elite, makes a living traveling at speeds upwards of 200 mph and is on the road more than 200 days a year. So when he wants to slow down, he heads to his hometown of Columbia, Missouri. NASCAR driver Carl Edwards grew up in Columbia, Missouri. He grew up in Columbia and couldn't wait to get out of town, but after living in North Carolina for three years, he was ready to come back. ""I realized after being away, there just aren't many places cooler than this,"" Edwards said. ""So I moved back, and now I live here and I'm really proud to live here."" He competes in both the Nationwide Series and the Sprint Cup Series for NASCAR. He won a Busch Series Cup in 2007, finished last year's Sprint Cup Series in second, and is fiercely fighting for Sprint Cup honors this year. Edwards has recovered from a frightening crash-ending to his last race in Talladega, Alabama, and is looking forward to racing in Richmond, Virginia, this week, hoping for his first trip of the season to victory lane. His fans are eagerly awaiting that trademark victory back flip. But through all of the excitement and acclaim, Edwards remains grounded and true to his Missouri roots. He took CNN home with him to Columbia -- which is between Kansas City and St. Louis -- to share some of his favorite spots. The day started at Rock Bridge State Park, 2,273 acres of natural beauty and serenity that is hard to believe is only 10 minutes from the bustling center of this college town. ""This park is one of Columbia's best secrets. It's a beautiful place to come mountain biking, hiking. There's a cave that runs under this ground that goes for over 50 miles."" The park boasts 15 miles of trails and endless possibilities for adventure, from hiking and biking to canoeing and even cave exploration. When Edwards gets the need for speed at home, he opts for two wheels instead of four. He grabs his bicycle and heads to the Katy Trail, just up the road from Rock Bridge Park. ""This used to be an old railroad, and now it's a state park. It's 10 feet wide, it's over 200 miles long, and all of this is open to the public."" Edwards also showed us one of his favorite trail features: a beautiful giant bur oak tree simply referred to by Missouri natives as ""the big bur oak."" Edwards says it's one of the oldest in the state and thinks that it is one of the coolest spots along the trail. All that exercise and fresh air can certainly rev up an appetite, and Edwards has two favorite places to cure that. For what he calls the best burger in the world, he heads to Booches Billiard Hall, one of his high school hangouts. ""We used to come here in high school when we probably should have been in school. We'd shoot pool, eat booch burgers and just have a good time,"" he said. We were greeted by one of the owners, Charlie Kurry, who poked a little fun at Edwards' trademark backflip celebration. ""The only thing flipping in here is the burgers,"" Kurry said. Booches has been in operation in Columbia since 1884. Next up is Shakespeare's Pizza, which has been serving slices in Columbia for more than 35 years. ""They can make you anything you want. They've got whole wheat crust if you're into the health stuff like I am. And it's so good, they even catered my wedding."" These are just some of the hidden gems of Carl Edwards' Columbia, but this town has much more to offer. There are museums, festivals and parades, and the University of Missouri has provided a lot of athletic excitement with its football and basketball teams over the past few years. It's a perfect weekend getaway from its larger surrounding cities. And if you live farther away than that, it's worth the trip!","NASCAR driver Carl Edwards shares his favorite spots in Columbia, Missouri .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) --   Over-the-counter painkillers and fever reducers will now carry new labels warning consumers of the potential risks of liver damage and internal bleeding associated with the drugs, according to a final ruling Tuesday by the Food and Drug Administration. The new warning labels will affect over-the-counter pain relievers including Tylenol, aspirin and ibuprofen. The new rule covers acetaminophen, the popular pain medicine also known as Tylenol, and a class of drugs known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs. The most commonly used NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen (the main ingredient in Motrin and Advil), naproxen and ketoprofen. The modified labeling also applies to all products that contain these ingredients, such as cough and cold medicines. Under the new rule, package labels and bottles must prominently state in highlighted text the drug's ingredients. For acetaminophen, the label must include bold lettering warning patients about severe liver damage. The new labeling also instructs patients using the blood thinner warfarin to consult their doctor before using acetaminophen. Bold lettering on NSAIDs labels must warn of severe stomach bleeding. ""Acetaminophen and NSAIDs are commonly used drugs for both children and adults because they are effective in reducing fevers and relieving minor aches and pain, such as headaches and muscle aches,"" said Dr. Charles Ganley, director of nonprescription drugs in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""However, the risks associated with their use need to be clearly identified on the label so that consumers taking these drugs are fully aware of the potential harm they can cause. It is important that they know how to take these medications safely to reduce their risk."" The new labeling for acetaminophen also warns against taking multiple drugs that contain acetaminophen at the same time and exceeding the recommended dosage of the drug. And, it warns that drinking alcohol -- three or more drinks a day -- while using the painkiller can increase the risk of liver damage. For NSAIDs, the new labels will also caution users that alcohol use and taking the drugs for longer than directed can increase the risk of stomach bleeding. The agency says the use of blood thinning drugs or steroids while taking NSAIDs can also increase the risk of internal bleeding. The American Pain Foundation is pleased with the new rule. ""This ruling will not only help protect consumers using OTC pain medication on a periodic basis,"" APF said, ""But will be especially meaningful for people suffering from chronic pain who may face co-morbid conditions and are taking OTC pain medication along with their prescribed pain medication."" According to the FDA, some manufacturers have already voluntarily started listing some of these risks on their product labels. The new rule gives manufacturers one year from today's date to re-label their products.","FDA requires OTC painkillers to carry new warnings on liver damage, bleeding risks .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- In radio broadcasts and sermons, Taliban militants have been promoting themselves as Islamic Robin Hoods, defending Pakistan's rural poor from a ruling elite that they describe as corrupt and oppressive. Mohammed Daoud, with his son Faisal, is among those who have embraced the Taliban's message. That message has been resonating throughout the Pakistani countryside, where the culture is deeply conservative and the people are desperately poor. In farmlands just 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the center of Islamabad, Mohammed Daoud and his 15-year-old son Faisal eke out a living by cutting grass for their four water buffalo. They feed their family of seven, earning the equivalent of around $50 a month by selling buffalo milk. Two months ago, Daoud said, the government bulldozed his family's house, probably because they were illegally squatting on property they did not own. ""Justice [in Pakistan] is only for people who have money,"" Daoud said, while slicing through handfuls of grass with a small scythe. ""We are illiterate,"" he added, ""but we are hoping that with Islamic sharia law, our lives will get better."" Across this overwhelmingly Muslim country, there is widespread hope that adopting a strict code of law based on the Koran will transform a society where corruption is rampant and where at least a quarter of the population lives under the poverty line. Watch why the Taliban's message would resonate . Enforcement of sharia law is the platform the Taliban have been using to justify recent land-grabs, such as last week's armed occupation of the district of Buner, some 60 miles from the Pakistani capital. In an interview with CNN, Muslim Khan, the Taliban spokesman in the militant stronghold of Swat Valley, denounced the Pakistani government, calling the prime minister and lawmakers ""un-Islamic."" ""They're making money like in a supermarket,"" Khan said, adding that under sharia law both the rich and the poor would be treated equally. Militants have slowly taken over territory in northwestern Pakistan by first targeting unpopular landlords and bureaucrats, according to Amnesty International, the human rights watchdog. ""Its systematic. The Taliban move into an area, they use local existing resentments. They often go in with the guise of being Robin Hoods,"" said Amnesty International representative Sam Zarifi. ""They scare away some local thieves, they impose very, very quick justice, very harsh justice, and initially in some places they are even welcomed."" The Taliban's promise of Islamic justice would be welcomed in farm fields on the outskirts of Islamabad. Rows of wheat -- along with the posh villas of Pakistan's ruling elite -- are within sight of Islamabad's iconic white Faisal Mosque. ""In the present judicial system, even the innocent people are punished,"" said Sajeet Hussein, as he and a group of farmers shared lunch under the shade of a tree. The group explained that they were losing a court battle to stop the government from seizing their land, because they claimed they couldn't afford to bribe policemen and judges. ""Every part of the country should have sharia law, like in Saudi Arabia,"" said Hussein's brother Babar, who sported a long bushy beard. ""Then poor and rich people will be equal."" ""We love the Taliban,"" announced one Pashtun farmer who asked not to be named. He called the militants heroes. Sports star-turned-politician Imran Khan summed up his response to the Taliban in Pakistan by saying, ""The poorer section of society is joining them...this is now developing into a battle between the 'haves' and the 'have-nots.' ""What the Taliban are giving them is cheap -- in fact, free -- accessible justice at the village level,"" he added. ""This is what Pakistan should be doing for its own people."" But if farmer Babar Hussein has his way, Taliban justice would mean taking away freedoms from Pakistani women, like the right to have a driver's license. ""Women should not even come out of their houses. That's against Islam"" he said, while complaining about the un-Islamic fashions he saw women wearing in Islamabad. When Taliban militants overran Buner last week, they told women to stay indoors, warned men to stop shaving their beards, and threatened shopkeepers who sold movies and music. In Pakistan's rural society, male strangers are not even supposed look at local women. And yet, some farmers enjoy blaring Bollywood music and even dancing on trailers full of hay, while driving their gaudily-decorated tractors. If the Taliban's rural revolt succeeds, it could bring silence to the Pakistani countryside.","Amnesty International: Taliban first targets unpopular landlords, bureaucrats .

"(CNN) -- A one-of-a-kind bicycle belonging to U.S. cycling legend Lance Armstrong was stolen from a team truck in California just hours after he rode it Saturday on the first day of a nine-day race. Lance Armstrong is racing in the California Amgen Tour as he attempts a comeback after retiring in 2005. Cancer survivor and seven-time Tour de France champion Armstrong is racing in the Amgen Tour of California this week as he continues his latest comeback after retiring from the sport in 2005. Armstrong's first comeback came in 1998, two years after he was diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain. Doctors gave him a less than 50 percent chance of survival. Armstrong announced the bike theft on his Twitter account Sunday morning and posted a photograph. ""There is only one like it in the world therefore hard to pawn it off. Reward being offered,"" the Texan wrote before going out and finishing fifth in Sunday's testing first stage won by Spain's Francisco Mancebo. Swiss Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara, who started the day in the yellow jersey after winning Saturday's time-trial prologue, pulled out midway through the stage feeling unwell. Armstrong improved from 10th to fifth overall, one minute five seconds adrift, with Astana teammate Levi Leipheimer, the two-time defending champion, in second place behind Mancebo. ""Holy hell. That was terrible,"" commented Armstrong who had a puncture. ""Maybe one of the toughest days I've had on a bike, purely based on the conditions. I'm still freezing."" The bicycle that was stolen is not the one that Armstrong rides every day during the race. The stolen bike is used only for time trials, a race in which cyclists ride individually at staggered intervals over a set distance and try to get the best time. The thieves took four bikes from a truck Armstrong's Astana team had parked behind a hotel in Sacramento. The other three bicycles belonged to team members Janez Brajkovic, Steve Morabito and Yaroslav Popovych, Astana said. Armstrong, 37, won the Tour de France, considered the premiere bicycle race in the world, a record seven times from 1999-2005. The 750-mile Amgen Tour of California ends Sunday. It is the second major race in which Armstrong has participated since announcing his comeback in September. He raced last month in the Tour Down Under in Australia, finishing 29th. Armstrong said he is aiming for another Tour de France victory this summer and was not expected to contend in the Australian race, which he used to gauge his fitness level after more than three years out of the saddle.","Lance Armstrong's one-of-a-kind bicycle stolen from team truck in California .

"(CNN) -- Meeting planner Gail Murphy heard about the travel warning to Mexico too late in the day on Monday to do anything about her plans to head to Cancun the following day. Alberto Morales wore a mask on his flight from Mexico City to Denver, Colorado, on Monday. ""I'm in good health,"" said Murphy, who is heading to the Eighth Annual Mexico Showcase and Travel Expo from her home in Shelburne, Vermont. ""I'm a risk taker, so I'll go anyway."" In light of the swine flu, the U.S. State Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning against any non-essential travel to Mexico. The move could potentially devastate an already struggling tourism industry in the country. The World Health Organization urged countries not to restrict international travel or close borders, as such measures would not in themselves stem the outbreak. Efforts to contain the outbreak by restricting travel would be unlikely to work without ""draconian measures,"" said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the agency's assistant director-general. But he said people who are ill should put off trips abroad, and people who fall ill after a trip should see a doctor. Mexico is the epicenter for the swine influenza virus outbreak. More than 100 deaths in Mexico are being investigated as possibly tied to the outbreak. The WHO confirmed 73 cases of swine flu Monday, but health officials in Scotland, California and Texas confirmed nine more, bringing the worldwide total to 82. Reports of the illness in Mexico couldn't have come at a worse time for the country's tourism industry, which is already grappling with negative publicity about drug-cartel fueled violence. ""They were having a terrible time anyway with all of the problems on the border and now to be hit with this, too,"" said Barbara Nassau, owner of New York-based In House Travel Solutions. She added that the outbreak has the potential to hamper travel similar to the way it was affected when bird flu hit China. iReporter Dyana Pari Nafissi works in international business development in Mexico City and said tourism in the country had already been dealt a blow by fears of violence. iReport.com: Watch Dyana discuss what's happening in Mexico . ""We've been on a steady decline since the first U.S. travel warning about the drug cartels,"" she said. ""When you look at the kids that braved [that travel warning], and now they are back [in the U.S.] and they are sick. It's devastating to the economy here."" Some of the confirmed cases in the United States were high school students who recently returned from a trip to Mexico. News of the outbreak didn't seem to overly concern travelers arriving Monday at Denver International Airport on a Mexicana flight from Mexico City. Two Mexicana crew members who didn't want to be named said about 60 percent of the passengers wore masks during the flight. Ernesto Vargas, a Mexican businessman, didn't wear a mask. ""I thought about carrying one with me, but the crew wasn't wearing a mask. So we asked them, and it seemed quite safe."" Alberto Morales, another businessman, said he wore a mask in the Mexico City airport and on the plane. ""Yes. I have a mask, and we are using the mask."" Is he concerned? ""Don't worry, I am OK,"" he said with a laugh. ""People are afraid about the flu, but we have many precautions and the government has a good sense for this trouble,"" Morales said. Ian Jeffries, a spokesman for Expedia.com, said the company had no data as of Monday on cancellations or changes caused by fear of swine flu, but added that it was prepared to aid any of its customers that had concerns. ""Expedia is currently offering to waive Expedia-imposed change and cancel fees for hotel and air reservations originally booked to Mexico,"" he said. ""We will continue to monitor the situation and modify our policy accordingly."" Several major U.S. airlines also are waiving fees for those who want to change their travel plans to Mexico. Jeffery Brown arrived at the airport in Atlanta, Georgia, on Monday after spending five days in Cancun with his wife. They saw people in surgical masks but didn't notice any widespread concern. ""My wife and I were a little concerned, but you know we haven't seen anybody sick in our resort, and we haven't seen anybody sick at the airport,"" he said. ""Nobody said a word about it [at the resort]."" Mexico isn't the only country that potentially has a tourism headache on its hands. Cases of swine flu have also popped up in Canada and Spain as well as the United States and Scotland.  Watch how businesses might be affected by swine flu » . Steve Weakland, border security coordinator for the United States Customs and Border Protection  Atlanta field office, said all of his personnel have received illness recognition training. If a traveler exhibits symptoms of the disease, CBP employees have been trained to inform the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to further investigate. ""Our guys are more the recognition aspect of it,"" Weakland said. ""We wouldn't make any diagnosis or anything along those lines."" Teresa Roberts planned to take her mom to Akumal, Mexico, for Mother's Day and said she was more worried about traveling to New York for business than she is about contracting swine flu south of the border. ""Just because of the number of different travelers that go through the airports in New York from all around the world,"" said Roberts who flies about two or three weeks a month  from her home in Atlanta, Georgia. ""I'm not nervous about going to Mexico at all."" Many in the tourism industry appeared to be taking a wait-and-see approach. Disney Cruise Lines, which does not sail into Mexico, said it is closely monitoring the situation, as did officials for theme parks including Universal and Sea World in Orlando, Florida. Meg Barton travels several times a year to Mexico from her home in Round Rock, Texas, and also isn't overly worried. Because of her father's recent heart surgery, she is already an avid hand washer and is always cautious about germs when abroad. ""I don't drink a lot of water in Mexico ever, and I am really more concerned about the drug issues in Mexico than I am the swine flue,"" Barton said. ""We take antibiotics and Pepto with us when we travel."" Eric Meyer of Lafayette, Colorado, flew in to Minneapolis-St. Paul with his wife and baby to visit family in Minnesota and lamented that ""It's out there, but what can you do?"" ""Wash your hands maybe and call it good,"" he added. ""Put a mask on? [I'm] not gonna go that far and be that guy yet."" Rochelle Yates said a client of her New York City-based Yates Travel is planning to take plenty of antiseptic products on an upcoming trip to Cancun. Most seasoned travelers know to guard against infectious disease ordinarily, Yates said. ""My clients are people who travel all over the world, and they know that you have to take precautions regardless,"" Yates said. ""You have to wash your hands no matter where you are, if you are on a cruise ship, in a hotel or even in your own house.""

"(CNN) -- On Monday night, CNN's Larry King had an exclusive interview with actor George Clooney, who returned from the strife-torn Darfur region of Sudan and just finished meeting with Vice President Joe Biden. George Clooney, left, talks with Vice President Joe Biden at the White House on Monday. King spoke with the activist actor live from the White House on the humanitarian crisis Clooney says we must confront, along with getting a couple of tidbits about what's next for Clooney's acting career. The following is a partial transcript, edited for brevity and clarity: . Larry King: We begin with George Clooney, the Oscar-winning actor and activist. He's traveled to Darfur at the refugee camps near the Sudan/Chad border last week and met with Vice President [Joe] Biden today. He's standing, as you see, in front of the White House, where it's 12 degrees. And we thank him for doing this, because he's freezing to death. George Clooney: I should have worn an overcoat tonight. King: You have no coat on? Clooney: No -- and no pants either ... King: Well, you've always been a little strange, George. Anyway, you met with the vice president today about Darfur. What did you tell him? Clooney:  Basically, we were just talking about coming back from Chad, right on the border of Darfur. And we were talking about there's a moment coming up relatively soon, probably by the middle of next week, where the International Criminal Court is going to indict the president of Sudan for war crimes, which has never happened before -- a sitting president. And we talked about this being an opportunity, perhaps, not just for the United States, but all of us together to work with the international community in a real diplomatic effort to try and bring some sort of peace to this region. King: What scale of interest did Biden show? Clooney: Vice President Biden has been incredibly vocal on the issue. We had a long talk about the idea of, first and foremost, appointing a high level, full-time envoy that reports directly to the White House so that it's not just temporary. We need somebody working on this, you know, every day -- getting up every morning with their sole job to find peace in the area. King: What did you see last week? Clooney: It was rough. You know, it's always rough over there. You feel terrible for them. They're hanging on by a thread. We saw an awful lot of fear. There was [also] a tremendous amount of hope. You know, there was a lot of hope that these indictments and this new administration are going to be able to help move the international community toward toward a real peace. King: How do you handle just meeting with these people and seeing this tragedy? Personally, how do you handle it? Clooney: I could tell you a million stories about how it actually affects you personally. But I don't think people should be going there and coming back and saying how it affected them. I think somehow we should all know that these people are hanging on by the skin of their teeth. King: Was your safety in jeopardy? Clooney: Oh, you're talking about the U.N. story. King: Yes. What, they pulled your security, right? Clooney: I was never in jeopardy. I was with journalists who wanted to go into some areas that weren't particularly safe. And we decided that we would go. And that wasn't necessarily part of what the U.N. was looking to do. And so we just went on our own. It was fine. I wanted to say something, also, Larry, which I forgot to say about what I just did today. I delivered 250,000 postcards signed by people all across the country who wanted to help give some political capital to and remind this administration of how important this issue is. It was from the Save Darfur people. But it's from all across the country. And we're probably going to have another 700,000 by the end of the week. King: What specifically, George, do you want Secretary of State Clinton and the administration to do? Clooney: It doesn't appear that the United States is going to send troops in or that the U.N. Is going to send in an army to do this. What it really means is that we're going to need diplomacy. And diplomacy has to start and it has to be aggressive and it has to start soon. We have an opportunity here. King: One other quick thing. Are you going to be in the final presentation of ""E.R. ?"" Clooney: Actually, I'm doing a remake of ""Friends,"" which -- I didn't want to break the news. King: Oh, my gosh. Clooney: I'm going be playing the Jennifer Aniston role. King: I'm thrilled for you, George. Clooney: Thank you. It's a career move. It's a choice. King: Are you going to be in ""E.R.?"" Clooney: I am. I'm in the last episode with Susan Sarandon and Julianna Margulies. So it should be fun. King: Thanks, George. Get out of the cold. Clooney: Thank you. It's good to talk to you.","CNN's Larry King talks with George Clooney about his trip to see Darfur refugees .

"(CNN) -- Maybe you had one as a kid, or knew someone who did. It's the iconic little red wagon with the Radio Flyer logo. Radio Flyer is developing a prototype of a wagon with digital controls and an MP3 player dock. If so, you might not recognize the newest product dreamed up by the brain trust at Radio Flyer's Chicago, Illinois, headquarters. This wagon, called the Cloud 9, is equipped with enough high-tech bells and whistles to make the family minivan jealous. ""We approached this product much like an automotive company might with a concept car,"" said Mark Johnson, Radio Flyer's product development manager. Outfitted with 5-point safety harnesses, padded seats, cup holders, foot brakes and fold-out storage containers, the sleek, curved Cloud 9 has every family covered for a ride through the park. But that's just for starters. There's a digital handle that tracks temperature, time, distance and speed -- just in case energetic parents want to track their split times around the playground. And there's a slot for an MP3 player, complete with speakers, for some cruising tunes. That's right: The little red wagon has gone 2.0. ""Music is such an important part of kids' and families' lives, we thought it would be great to have a speaker system built in the wagon,"" said Tom Schlegel, vice president of product development. The Cloud 9 is still a prototype, but it wasn't developed on a whim. The company did extensive market research beforehand, then tested it out on the real experts at home. ""We sit down [and] observe how moms and kids are using our products,"" said Schlegel. ""That's where our new ideas come from."" To develop those ideas, Radio Flyer's designers are using state-of-the art technology. They use Wacom Cintiq graphic tablets, allowing them to draw directly onto digital renderings of new products. And Radio Flyer also has its own in-house computer numerical control, or CNC, machines that create prototypes right on site. Radio Flyer's blend of cutting-edge design and old-fashioned products appears to be a successful recipe. In an economy where businesses and families alike are tightening their belts, the company is still going strong. ""Radio Flyer survived the Great Depression, and this year has been a difficult year for a lot of companies,"" Schlegel says, ""But Radio Flyer is actually growing this year. We're actually looking for engineers and designers in our product development group to keep up with the growth of the company."" That's quite a testament for a company nearly 90 years old. Theirs is an American success story that started when Italian immigrant Antonio Pasin started building wooden toy wagons in 1917. He had limited success but was encouraged enough to start the Liberty Coaster Company in 1923. The company changed names seven years later, becoming Radio Steel & Manufacturing. The world was introduced that same year to the first steel wagon, called the Radio Flyer. Since then, Radio Flyer has become perhaps the world's most famous maker of wagons, tricycles and other toys. The company's best-known product even inspired a 1992 movie, ""Radio Flyer,"" about a boy who imagines converting his red wagon into a flying machine to help his little brother flee an abusive stepdad. Whether you grew up on Rock-'em Sock-'em Robots or Xbox, the little red wagon has remained a mainstay of child's play. It's certainly evolved over the years, though -- the rusty metal has been replaced with plastic. But the spirit of Radio Flyer, which conjures memories of a simpler time, remains intact. ""One of the most important things about Radio Flyer products is that they really help [keep kids active outdoors],"" Schlegel said. ""So when we're designing our products, we're really looking at how can we get kids outside and playing, away from the video games and TV screens and computer screens."" CNN.com's Brandon Griggs contributed to this story.","Radio Flyer, maker of the classic red toy wagon, is creating a high-tech new product .

"(Parenting.com) -- Bed has always been a place I can't get enough of: the sex; the sleep; cozy afternoons reading; lazy Saturday mornings listening to hyper neighbors mow their lawns. ""I learned that Dad really can be interchangeable with Mom, if only I'll let him."" After my husband and I had kids, bed also became the object of my dearest fantasies -- the oasis I dreamed about in my late-afternoon stupor, when I knew that many hours still lay between me and the sheets. My covetous view of bed changed, however, midway through my third pregnancy, when some suspicious bleeding led my obstetrician to prescribe bed rest for several days, possibly longer. ""But I have two small kids!"" I protested. For those of you more gestationally fortunate, ""bed rest"" means lying there for hour upon idle hour -- or in the worst cases, week upon idle week -- afraid that even taking a quick shower or reaching for the TV remote might make you lose your baby. Parenting.com: 71 new-mom truths . What would my 4-year-old son and 2-year-old daughter do without Mama to attend to them every second of their exhausting days? Who could I get to fill my maternal shoes? Our relatives live far away. Hiring a nanny was financially out of the question. The answer, of course, was that the children's father would have to be their mother (he runs his own company from home), although I must confess I had my doubts. George is a wonderful, involved dad; he changes diapers, does ""this little piggy,"" and pitches baseballs equally well -- and equally willingly. But George has always slept straight through 3 a.m. feedings and bad dreams. I'm the chief of childhood minutiae around here; the one who pours the juice, monitors the wee-wees, and knows what ""do the coyote"" means (a dry-eye technique for shampooing hair). On top of being both Mama and Daddy, George would have to play nurse to me too. But -- the biggest, overriding but -- the unborn baby's health was paramount. ""Get in bed, stay in bed, and don't worry about a thing,"" George ordered. Parenting.com: How men change, from lover to husband to father . The first few hours went quickly enough. There was the novelty of gliding between fresh sheets in the middle of the day and the welcome release from snack doling and bottom wiping. ""Mommy's sick,"" my husband explained to the kids, closing my door. I read straight through one of those books that ordinarily serve as dust catchers. I napped. With the door closed and the fan whirring, you couldn't even tell there were two tots downstairs. It was so quiet. Quiet usually means trouble's afoot. Did George realize this? ""Mommy! Mommy!"" I heard them cry. Or did I? My maternal engines idling nervously, I pictured the kids stoned on Cheetos and Popsicles; my daughter's unchanged Pull-Ups sagging to her knees; six straight hours of the Cartoon Network turning their little eyeballs into black-and-white checkerboards. Darn it, why was it so quiet downstairs? ""Mommy! Mommy!"" It was the kids, bursting through my bedroom doorway with excited squeals. George had taken them out to dinner and bought each child a toy doctor's kit. They were palpably relieved at being able to take an active part in my scary convalescence. Solemnly, they listened to my heartbeat, ""tested"" my blood pressure, and administered innumerable shots. ""You must stay in bed!"" admonished the 2-year-old, wagging a pudgy finger. I had to admit that, had the circumstances been reversed, with me filling in for a bedridden George, I'd never have thought of something so clever. Then the object of my admiration appeared. ""Okay, you can get up now,"" he said, handing me my robe. Already? I wondered. Was he throwing in the towel after just a few hours? Then two young muscle-bound guys materialized in the bedroom and began to remove the saggy, full-size, 10-year-old mattress on which I had just been lying. A few minutes later, they marched back up the stairs brandishing a brand-new, ultra-firm king-size model. George put down new sheets and sent me back to bed. Wow! That wasn't all. My dinner that evening arrived on a tray -- stuffed salmon, baked potato, and broccoli on good china, with a chocolate bar on the side. The kids sat with me quietly, impressed and awaiting the chocolate. Now, I don't know what the kitchen looked like or exactly how often my daughter's Pull-Ups were changed, but for the next several days George knocked himself out keeping everyone happy. He rented six movies for me (half based on Jane Austen novels, half starring Harrison Ford). He monitored the kids' frequent visits to give me more ""shots"" and let them deliver my mail (from which he'd removed all the bills, leaving only the juicy catalogs). They went to the park and the zoo. Blessedly, my bout with bed rest lasted less than a week. The bleeding stopped as mysteriously as it had begun, and four and a half months later my baby daughter was born beautiful and perfect. But the lessons of the episode linger on today. I learned that Dad really can be interchangeable with Mom, if only I'll let him. And that it takes more than one person to keep a family running -- it's a minuet among all its members. When one of us falls back, the others fill in. Parenting.com: How to slow down, relax, and enjoy motherhood . Sometimes now, on particularly long days, when all three kids are crying at once and I begin to unspool, shrieking back at them like the Anti-June Cleaver, my husband will say to me, in an oh-stop-being-a-martyr tone of voice, ""Why don't you just go to bed?""

"ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- Regrowing a fingertip cut off in an accident sounds like something from a futuristic movie. But with innovative technology developed by the U.S. Army, such regrowth is possible today. This remotely controlled robot, called BEAR, could help remove injured soldiers from battlefields. This research project and a hundred others were on display this month at the 26th Army Science Convention. Some the greatest minds in science from around the world gathered at the four-day conference to exchange ideas and showcase collaborative projects between the Army's research laboratories, universities and partner industries. The main goal is to develop technology to make soldiers safer and more effective, said Thomas H. Killion, the Army's chief scientist. The Army's regenerative medicine study combined properties from the intestinal lining and the urinary bladder to create a regenerative substance called Extracellular Matrix. The cream-colored crystallized powder, called ""magic dust,"" boosts the body's natural tendency to repair itself, said U.S. Army Biological Scientist Sgt. Glen Rossman. When the matrix is applied to a missing digit or limb, ""the body thinks it's back in the womb,"" Rossman said. One civilian participated in the regenerative-medicine study after cutting off the tip of his finger in a model plane's propeller. Researchers continually applied the matrix to the wound, and after four weeks, the body grew skin and tissue to replenish the damaged area. The U.S. military branches have begun a consortium with private institutions to develop treatments for severely injured troops. With the help of grants, the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine is studying nerve and vein transplantation, treating burns without scarring and regeneration of tissue, skin and even bone. Through both animal studies and civilian clinical trials, the institute is developing therapies for the large number of soldiers injured by improvised explosive devices and other explosives in Afghanistan and Iraq. ""We are working on trying to regenerate limbs, to repair limbs and to keep them from being amputated,"" institute Project Director Col. Bob Vandre said. Army scientists also have developed an engineered skin substitute made in a laboratory from patients' own cells. A postage stamp-sized patch of skin could grow several times larger than the original sample. The engineered skin could then be placed over a wound or burn, protecting it from infection, and eventually cover large portions of the body that have been damaged. ""Our goal is to restore the function to our wounded warriors who have given so much in battle,"" Vandre said. Armed Forces Institute scientists also say they also have developed a process to rebuild missing or damaged bone. A web-like tube of calcium-phosphate ceramic, called hydroxyapatite, acts as a biodegradable scaffold that is set in place of the missing bone, giving the body a platform on which to rebuild. Scientists say the scaffold allows the body to regrow its own natural tissue, bone and veins so it can support itself. Because of the complexity of the process, researchers so far have regrown only 3 centimeters of bone in clinical trials on rats, but they hope to reach 5 centimeters in two years. With the regrown bone, scientists could avoid placing titanium or other medical devices in the body. Of course, to apply this technology, the Army needs a way to safely remove injured soldiers from combat zones. Enter the Battlefield Extraction Assist Robot, or BEAR, a human-shaped machine with eyes, ears and arms for lifting heavy objects. Built by Vecna Technologies in association with the Army, BEAR is still a prototype. But its potential is promising. BEAR is outfitted with lights, two cameras and infrared abilities, and it can travel up to 10 mph. The device also can lift 250 pounds while balancing on its toes. Vecna robotic engineer Andrew Allen says BEAR can be remotely operated, reducing the chance of injuries to soldiers' human rescuers. ""BEAR can easily be replaced; it costs money and not lives,"" Allen said. Robot technology has exploded in the past six years, said Army scientist John Parmentola. Robot prototypes of all kinds were on display at the conference, and about 10,000 military robots are expected to be deployed in the field in 2009. Robots can be outfitted to accomplish various tasks. One can detect 38 different chemical or biological explosives from a distance of 3 to 5 meters. The robot could be used to scan car doors or truck lids for explosives or chemical residue. Another, called Packbot, is deployed in Iraq for surveillance, reconnaissance and explosives removal. Packbot has been outfitted to react to voice commands, given remotely through an earpiece. Loud background noises do not distort the commands, because the system monitors the vibrations of the operator's jawbone. Finally, some robots come with a retractable apparatus called a Zipper Mast or Situational Awareness Mast, which can be equipped with a camera or antenna and raised to peer over walls or send radio communications. The smallest Zipper Mast is not much bigger than a coffee pot and can extend to a height of 8 feet. Designed by the U.S. Army's Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center, the larger mast is affixed to tanks and can reach heights over 30 feet.","Cutting-edge technology on display at U.S. Army Science Convention .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday federal regulators have the authority to clamp down on the broadcast TV networks that air isolated cases of profanity, known as ""fleeting expletives."" The Supreme Court ruled federal regulators can stop TV networks from airing profanity. The 5-4 vote was a victory for Bush-era officials who pushed fines and sanctions when racy images and language reached the airwaves. Controversial words have been aired in scripted and unscripted instances on all the major over-the-air networks in the past six years -- dating back to when the Federal Communications Commission began considering a stronger, no-tolerance policy. ""It suffices the new policy is permissible under the statute, there are good reasons for it, and the agency believes it to be better,"" said Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the conservative majority. The high court, however, refused to decide whether the commission's policy violates the First Amendment guarantee of free speech, only the agency's enforcement power. The justices ordered the free-speech aspect to be reviewed again by a federal appeals court. ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox were parties in the case. A federal appeals court in New York had ruled in their favor, calling the commission's policy ""arbitrary and capricious."" The commission then appealed to the Supreme Court, seeking restoration of its power to penalize the networks airing ""indecent"" speech, even if it is broadcast only one time, and even if it does not describe a specific sex act. The high court agreed to some extent. ""Even when used as an expletive, the F-word's power to insult and offend derives from its sexual meaning,"" wrote Scalia. Such language is heard with greater, albeit varying frequency on cable television, the Internet, and satellite radio, which do not use public airwaves. But the federal government is charged with responding to viewer complaints when ""indecent"" language reaches broadcast television and radio, which is subject to greater regulation. That is especially relevant during daytime and early evening hours, when larger numbers of families and younger viewers may be watching. The FCC's acting chairman, Michael Copps, called Tuesday's ruling a ""a big win for America's families."" The commission formally reversed its policy in March 2004 to declare even a single use of an expletive could be illegal. The changes became known as the ""Golden Globes Rule,"" for singer Bono's 2003 acceptance speech at the awards show on NBC, where he uttered the phrase ""really, really, f---ing brilliant."" The commission specifically cited celebrities Cher and Nicole Richie for potty-mouth language in the 2002 and 2003 Billboard Music Awards, which aired on Fox. Richie, in an apparent scripted moment said, ""Have you ever tried to get cow s--t out of a Prada purse? It's not so f---ing simple."" The complaint against ABC involved ""NYPD Blue,"" a now-canceled scripted police drama, and the CBS' complaint involved ""The Early Show,"" a news and interview program. Enforcement of the law had been put on hold while the case was being argued. In dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens said ""customs of speech"" and context made the Federal Communications Commission's position unworkable. ""As any golfer who has watched his partner shank a short approach knows, it would be absurd to accept the suggestion that the resultant four-letter word uttered on the golf course describes sex or excrement and is therefore indecent,"" he wrote. ""But that is the absurdity the FCC has embraced in its new approach to indecency."" And Stevens wondered why the agency was going after words that he said had a ""tenuous relationship"" to sex and bodily functions, while at the same time prime-time commercials ""frequently ask viewers whether they, too, are battling erectile dysfunction or are having trouble going to the bathroom."" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made clear how she viewed the broader free speech questions the high court may be forced to confront in coming years. ""There is no way to hide the long shadow the First Amendment casts over what the commission has done,"" she wrote. The Supreme Court first ventured into the broadcast speech debate in 1978, when it ruled as indecent a monologue by comedian George Carlin on society's taboo surrounding ""seven dirty words."" The bit had received some radio airplay. Stevens, 89, was the author of that opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas sided with his fellow conservatives on the narrow question presented to the court, but noted the changing landscape of television since Stevens' 31-year-old ruling. He said that and other high court precedents ""were unconvincing when they were issued, and the passage of time has only increased doubt regarding their continued validity."" He questioned the communication commission's underlying authority as a ""deep intrusion into the First Amendment rights of broadcasters."" And he noted the four networks no longer have a virtual monopoly on television content. ""For most consumers, traditional broadcast media programming is now bundled with cable or satellite services,"" he said, but the Federal Communications Commission's authority extends only to over-the-air television and radio content. Conservative and family groups called Tuesday's ruling an ""incredible victory."" ""We implore the broadcast networks to abide by today's court's ruling rather than to pursue a path of attempted obstruction with countless legal maneuverings,"" said Tim Winter, president of the Parents Television Council, which monitors content on the airwaves. ""And we encourage the FCC to use today's opinion to break the indecency complaint logjam, and rule on the merits of the tens of thousands of indecency complaints currently awaiting review at the commission."" There was no immediate reaction from the broadcast networks, but groups representing the artistic and creative community expressed displeasure. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on indecency on television . ""Today's decision is extremely disappointing,"" said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, head of the Media Access Project. ""We remain hopeful that the FCC's restrictive policies will ultimately be declared unconstitutional, but there will be several more years of uncertainty, and impaired artistic expression, while the lower courts address the First Amendment issues which the court chose not to confront today."" Time Warner -- the parent company of CNN -- filed a friend of the court brief supporting the networks fined by the communications commission. The company is part owner of the CW broadcast network, and operates several cable networks. The case is FCC v. Fox Television Stations (07-582).","NEW: FCC's acting chairman calls ruling ""a big win for America's families""

"(CNN) -- Jose Compean and Ignacio Ramos began their ""supervised release"" Friday after President Bush commuted their sentences in January for convictions related to the shooting of a Mexican drug smuggler. Ignacio Ramos has been out of prison since Febrary after serving time in the shooting of an illegal immigrant. Ramos and Compean were able to remove their electronic monitoring devices and leave their homes in El Paso, Texas, on Friday for the first time since they left prison in February. After spending two ""hard, long, lonely"" years in prison, the two said they were looking forward to spending time with their families and putting this chapter of their lives behind them. ""There are more important things than the people that have done this to us or what we have gone through and I am not going to sit here and dwell on that,"" Ramos said in an interview with CNN's ""Lou Dobbs Tonight."" ""We are looking ahead. We're optimistic for a very good future and that's what's more important,"" Ramos said. Their release in February marked a significant turning point in a case that served as a flash point in the debate over immigration and border security. The two were sentenced in 2006 to 11- and 12-year sentences stemming from the February 2005 shooting of Osvaldo Aldrete-Davila near the U.S.-Mexico border south of El Paso, Texas. Critics of U.S. immigration policy rushed to the agents' defense, saying they were merely doing their jobs. Civil liberties advocates argued that Compean and Ramos used excessive force. Ramos credited the outside support with helping him win clemency and keeping his spirits up during his imprisonment. ""Members from Congress were speaking about us, people writing us constantly, it felt so good to know that people didn't give up on us and that people constantly believed in us,"" he said. ""How can you give up when people aren't giving up on you?"" Compean echoed his sentiments, saying he was shocked to this day over the support he received. ""I didn't expect it. I expected people to really forget all about us once we turned ourselves in,"" he said. Like Ramos, Compean said the most difficult part of going to prison was leaving behind his wife and children. ""I think that's been the hardest. When I turned myself in, my son was 4 months old,"" he said. ""There's really nothing special I want to do. The only thing I'm really looking forward to is getting out of the house and going out to dinner with my wife and going to the park with my sons,"" Compean said. Their legal cases are far from over. The convictions still stand and the two remain felons while appeals are pending, which means they cannot contact one another or reapply for their jobs, something Ramos said he would like to do. Ramos shot Aldrete-Davila in the buttocks after he ditched a vehicle carrying more than 700 pounds of marijuana and fled on foot toward Mexico. The agents said during trial that Aldrete-Davila had brandished a gun while resisting arrest, but Aldrete-Davila said he was unarmed and trying to surrender when Compean attempted to beat him with a shotgun. ""In exchange for immunity, Aldrete-Davila agreed to cooperate with the investigation of the shooting, and he returned to the United States so that the bullet could be removed from his body,"" according to court documents. Ramos and Compean were convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon, lying about the incident and violating Aldrete-Davila's Fourth Amendment right against illegal search and seizure. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, a vocal critic of the decision to grant Aldrete-Davila immunity, said several key pieces of evidence were withheld from the jury that convicted Ramos and Compean. The jury, for instance, never learned that Aldrete-Davila was running drugs at the time of the shooting. Nor did jurors learn that Aldrete-Davila breached his immunity agreement by continuing to smuggle drugs into the United States, Cornyn has said. ""Several jurors have since come forward to state that if they had been told about the excluded evidence, they would have changed their verdict,"" Cornyn wrote in a January plea to Bush, requesting clemency for the agents. Despite Ramos' and Compean's appeals for clemency, a senior Bush administration official said the men were ""convicted felons who violated their oaths to uphold the law."" Leading Democrats and Republicans, however, supported Bush's commutation, the official said. ""The president has reviewed the circumstances of this case as a whole and the conditions of confinement and believes the sentences they received are too harsh and that they and their families have suffered enough for their crimes,"" the official said.","Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean begin their supervised release Friday .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- A gaggle of reporters pushed their microphones and cameras toward the North Korean official shortly after he arrived at a college campus here. North Korean diplomat Kim Myong-gil gathered with other officials to discuss North Korea's energy needs . But Kim Myong-gil's comments were off the record -- a sign of the sensitive nature of openly discussing concerns about North Korea's nuclear program. The U.S. State Department's director of Korean affairs, Kurt Tong, also agreed to participate in Thursday's conference as long as his statements were not published. Tong and Kim, a North Korea representative at the United Nations, gathered with others including former diplomats and academics at the Georgia Institute of Technology to discuss North Korea's energy needs and the status of the six-party talks on its nuclear program. Although the two top-level diplomats kept their remarks private, other participants in the conference at the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs aired their opinions openly. Much of the Korea conference focused on the scientific details of North Korea's infrastructure and how it could be improved to handle sources of energy other than nuclear, such as an oil pipeline or utilizing its significant mineral resources. But all those ideas will never be realized without a change in relations between North Korea, its neighbors and the United States, and that is why diplomacy was also part of the discussion. Thursday's conference coincided with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's announcement that her new envoy to North Korea, Stephen Bosworth, will travel to Russia, China, South Korea and Japan next week ""to consult on the next steps to move the six-party process forward."" Senior administration officials said Bosworth is considering heading to Pyongyang on that visit, but only if the leaders of the other parties involved in the talks are comfortable with that overture. Speaking at a joint news conference with Clinton, Bosworth said there is no doubt the United States plans ""to engage with North Korea."" ""The question as to whether we're going to engage with them on this particular trip remains to be decided,"" he said. ""That will depend upon our consultations in the region, and it will depend upon what we hear back from the North Koreans."" Thursday's conference also coincided with reports that North Korea is apparently preparing to test-fire its long-range missile, the Taepodong-2, under the guise of launching a satellite into space. Leon Sigal, a specialist on North Korea who used to work for the State Department, stressed that President Obama is at a ""starting point"" with North Korea. Mindful that the new U.S. leader is preoccupied with his country's economic recession, Sigal said Obama must act swiftly and decisively with regards to North Korea to avoid the mistakes of the previous administration. ""The only way to fix this problem is to negotiate,"" said Sigal, who is currently director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project at the Social Science Research Council in New York. Part of Sigal's proposal includes helping North Korea construct conventional power plants as it moves toward denuclearization. He outlined two ""troubling questions"" facing the Obama administration: how to avoid having to constantly react under pressure to North Korea's provocations, and how the scenario could change, possibly for the worse, if there is a change in leadership, ""now that Kim Jong-Il's health is at issue."" ""It seems to me the answer to both is for Washington to put a bigger deal on the negotiating table now,"" Sigal proposed. That drew a couple of comments and questions from the audience. One graduate student asked why the United States should ""put more oil in a leaky bucket,"" referring to the idea of sending more fuel oil shipments to North Korea when the previous shipments -- part of an agreement to get Pyongyang to shut down its nuclear facility -- have done little to deter the country from abandoning its nuclear program. North Korea maintains that it is due the oil shipments because it fulfilled its obligation to disable its Yongbyon nuclear complex. The United States has demanded Pyongyang verify that by allowing U.N. inspectors to inspect the facility, which it has refused. At Thursday's conference, former U.S. ambassador to South Korea James Laney cautioned against resorting to the same rhetoric about which side had violated previous agreements. ""I can understand how we want to score points ... but there are times when prudence or better wisdom or real strategy dictates that we have to (have) some sort of engagement,"" he said. Laney, who was instrumental in defusing the North Korean nuclear crisis in 1994, suggested that the United States propose a peace treaty to replace the 1953 armistice which effectively ended the Korean War. ""A peace treaty would mean there are two nations on the Korean peninsula,"" said Laney. ""There are two nations now, but a treaty would recognize (this)."" Victor Cha, who was the White House's director of Asian affairs under the Bush administration, cautioned against moving forward on securing a peace treaty before North Korea takes further steps toward denuclearization. ""Even if there are some (in North Korea) who would want to give up nuclear weapons in exchange for a peace treaty, there may be others that say, 'Once we have a peace treaty ... we can be recognized as a nuclear state,'"" according to Cha. Cha, who said he routinely has to apologize for being a member of the Bush administration, praised Obama's government, which he said has ""none of the hang-ups"" in dealing with North Korea's leadership that the previous administration had. Laney urged the new administration to ""move beyond sticks and carrots,"" which was the stated approach of the Bush administration. While there is no guarantee that a peace treaty or any other overture to North Korea would work, Laney and Sigal said the administration has to try a new approach. ""You see, I'm 81 and I want to see something (happen) before I die,"" said Laney, who worked in U.S. Army counterintelligence before serving in the Korean War. ""Fifty-five years is a long time."" Sigal concurred, saying that ""diplomatic give-and-take is the only policy"" for North Korea. ""But sustaining diplomacy ... will be difficult,"" he added.. ""Kim Jong-Il wants to force America to be his friend,"" he said, referring to the North Korean leader. ""He seems unwilling to unclench his fist and shake Obama's hand. We may have to settle for a fist bump.""","Officials, academics gather to discuss North Korea's energy needs .

"(CNN) -- Japan's defense minister has ordered two destroyers to help fight piracy in the waters off Somalia, officials with the defense ministry told CNN. Pirates are caught on camera off the Somalian coast. The Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyers will be dispatched Saturday, the defense ministry said. The order, which the Cabinet approved earlier Friday, marks the first policing action for the MSDF, whose major missions overseas have focused on background support such as transport and refueling, Japan's Kyodo news agency said. A bill approved on the same day allows the MSDF to be deployed in piracy-infested waters as needed. The move comes after Somali pirates released a Panamanian-flagged, Japanese-owned vessel that was hijacked in the Gulf of Aden in November, according to a non-governmental group that monitors piracy. The ship was released last month. The 18 Filipino and five South Korean crew members were reportedly unharmed. It was unclear whether the pirates were paid a ransom to release the ship. Japan Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada said the provision would be used on an interim basis, the news agency reported. Two destroyers with about 400 personnel and eight coast guard officers will be aboard the ships, whose escort mission will start in early April after about three weeks of sailing toward Somalia, according to the news agency.","The order marks the first policing action for the MSDF .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A day after publishing a cartoon that drew fire from critics who said it evoked historically racist images, the New York Post apologized in a statement on its Web site -- even as it defended its action and blasted some detractors. A New York Post cartoon has sparked a debate over race and cartooning this week. Many of those critical of the cartoon said it appeared to compare President Obama to a chimpanzee in a commentary on his recently approved economic stimulus package. ""Wednesday's Page Six cartoon -- caricaturing Monday's police shooting of a chimpanzee in Connecticut -- has created considerable controversy,"" the paper said about the drawing, which shows two police officers standing over the body of a chimpanzee they just shot. The drawing is a reference to the mauling of a woman by a pet chimpanzee, which was then killed by police. In the cartoon, one of the officers tells the other, ""They'll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill."" The Post said the cartoon was meant to mock what it called an ""ineptly written"" stimulus bill. ""But it has been taken as something else -- as a depiction of President Obama, as a thinly veiled expression of racism,"" reads the statement. ""This most certainly was not its intent; to those who were offended by the image, we apologize.""  Watch reaction to Post's apology » . But the statement immediately swerves to fire back at some of the image's critics. ""However, there are some in the media and in public life who have had differences with The Post in the past -- and they see the incident as an opportunity for payback,"" the statement says. ""To them, no apology is due. Sometimes a cartoon is just a cartoon -- even as the opportunists seek to make it something else."" Several African-American leaders, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, attacked the image, which was drawn by artist Sean Delonas. Sharpton said Thursday he and the leaders of ""various groups"" would respond at 5 p.m. Friday outside The Post's offices in midtown Manhattan. ""Though we think it is the right thing for them to apologize to those they offended,"" the statement appeared to blame those who raised the issue ""rather than take responsibility for what they did,"" Sharpton said. He accused the newspaper of having ""belatedly come with a conditional statement after people began mobilizing and preparing to challenge the waiver of News Corp in the city where they own several television stations and newspapers."" Delonas has made Sharpton the butt of previous cartoons in The Post. In a brief phone interview with CNN, Delonas called the controversy ""absolutely friggin' ridiculous."" ""Do you really think I'm saying Obama should be shot? I didn't see that in the cartoon,"" Delonas told CNN. ""It's about the economic stimulus bill,"" he added. Col Allan, the Post's editor-in-chief, said Wednesday that the cartoon ""is a clear parody of a current news event."" ""It broadly mocks Washington's efforts to revive the economy. Again, Al Sharpton reveals himself as nothing more than a publicity opportunist,"" Allan said in a written statement. But Sharpton was not alone in his criticism. Barbara Ciara, president of the National Association of Black Journalists, said The Post showed a ""serious lapse in judgment"" by running the cartoon. ""To think that the cartoonist and the responsible editors at the paper did not see the racist overtones of the finished product should insult their intelligence,"" Ciara said in a written statement. ""Instead, they celebrate their own lack of perspective and criticize those who call it what it is: tone deaf at best, overtly racist at worst."" iReport.com: Share your reaction to the N.Y. Post cartoon . ""Comparing President Obama and his effort to revive the economy in a manner that depicts violence and racist inferences is unacceptable,"" said National Urban League President Marc Morial in a statement issued Wednesday. The nearly $800 billion stimulus package was the top priority for Obama, the first black U.S. president, who signed it Tuesday. In an open letter to The Post, musician John Legend criticized the newspaper and called on New Yorkers not to buy it, or talk to its reporters or buy its advertising space.  Addressing the newspaper's editors, Legend wrote, ""Did it occur to you that our president has been receiving death threats since early in his candidacy? Did it occur to you that blacks have historically been compared to various apes as a way of racist insult and mockery? Did you intend to invoke these painful themes when you printed the cartoon? ""If that's not what you intended, then it was stupid and willfully ignorant of you not to connect these easily connectable dots. If it is what you intended, then you obviously wanted to be grossly provocative, racist and offensive.""

"London, England (CNN) -- European officials expressed frustration at Russia and Ukraine's inability to enforce an agreement to resume delivery of natural gas, amid heat and cooking gas shortages and sub-zero temperatures endured by millions of people. A woman passes in front of a manometer set on a gas pipe in the Ukrainian city of Boyarka, near Kiev. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was expected to meet Friday with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Yulia Timoshenko in an emergency meeting in Berlin. Merkel said she was likely to reinforce the EU's position as a natural gas customer. ""There is a risk that the confidence in Russia may be lost due to the ongoing disruption,"" said Merkel. On Thursday European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso urged Ukraine and Russia to quickly implement a compromise that would return natural gas deliveries from Russia's Gazprom's pipelines through the Ukraine as soon as possible. ""If the agreement is not honored, it means that Russia and Ukraine are no longer to be considered reliable partners for the EU in matters of energy supply,"" said Barroso. Ukraine is a major entry point for Russian gas into Europe. Russia and Ukraine's dispute over pricing and contractual terms began nearly a year ago, escalating into the present crisis that has prompted Russia to turn off its taps. Both nations help deliver about 25 percent of Europe's natural gas. In the long term, the EU eyed plans to build a pipeline to purchase natural gas from Central Asia and eventually Iraq and Iran. It was also building up infrastructure to import liquefied gas from North Africa and the Middle East and exploring nuclear energy. During Wednesday's open session, European Parliament members and commissioners lashed out, with EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs saying, ""We are living through one of the most serious energy crises yet-comparable with the 1970s oil crisis."" ""Despite promises and the protocol signed on Monday, gas is not yet flowing from Russia through Ukraine."" Piebalgs said Russia had resumed gas deliveries on Tuesday, at one-third of normal flow, but Ukraine had stopped it claiming that Russia had chosen a difficult entry point. Eastern Europe was experiencing a historic low in temperatures and Siberian weather conditions. When Russia's natural gas delivery was halted, it relied on its stockpile, which is quickly running out. Croatia's government has declared pre-alert measures and announced gas shutdowns for everyone except for households, hospitals, schools and kindergartens. In the capital city of Zagreb, businesses are losing money due to the shortage, an estimated 10,000 Euros a day. Five hundred companies have been cut-off so far. Danijel Zadijeloviae, owner of Lipik Glass, said the shortages have lost his business millions of Euros. ""If we had lost gas for only a second, it would caused us damages of up to 3 and a half million euros,"" he said. CNN's Jim Boulden and Matthew Chance contributed to this report.","NEW: Merkel says Russia risks the loss of confidence due to disruption .

"(CNN)  -- When Kellogg's dumped its endorsement of Michael Phelps after a photograph surfaced of the Olympic gold medalist using a bong, the company was stuck with thousands of boxes of cereal featuring the swimmer's image. Kellogg's ended its Michael Phelps endorsement, so it sent two tons of cereal with his face on it to a food bank. No problem. The company, based in Battle Creek, Michigan, made short order of the already-printed and filled boxes, donating two tons of cereal to the San Francisco Food Bank late last month. With food banks across the country reporting shortages of food, the donation was a welcome one, said the food bank's director of development, Christopher Wiley. It took only two weeks for about 3,000 boxes to move through warehouse. ""Thousands of families benefited from the donation"" Wiley said. ""It was a surprise to us. We were lacking a lot of cereal. It is a great product many low-income families really need."" ""The real story for us was not the box but what's inside the box. The food is so valuable for the community. It's making good from bad,"" Wiley said. The food bank has seen a 6 percent increase in its customer base since the beginning of the year, he said. Phelps, 23, won a record eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China. He admitted ""regrettable behavior"" after a British newspaper published the controversial photograph in early February. The tabloid News of the World showed Phelps using the bong during what it said was a November party at the University of South Carolina in Columbia. A bong is a device commonly used to smoke marijuana. The Phelps box attracted considerable attention to the food bank. Administrators received several calls from people wanting to get the box as a novelty item. But, said Wiley, all the cereal went to food bank customers. Kellogg's was the only one of Phelps sponsors to drop the athlete, although U.S.A. Swimming, the nation's governing body for competitive swimming, suspended him for three months, withdrew financial support and barred him from competition during the period of his ""reprimand.""

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Barely a year after the country celebrated its return to democracy, Pakistan is ensnared in a new political crisis. Riot police block a street on Thursday leading to a court building in Karachi, Pakistan. Thousands of lawyers planned a four-day march to the country's capital, Islamabad, on Thursday, demanding that the government immediately reinstate judges whom the previous president ousted. The protesters plan a sit-in at the parliament building on Monday, and say they will continue their demonstrations indefinitely until their demands are met. At the same time, the country's main opposition leader and his supporters have joined in the nationwide protests, but for reasons of their own. The government responded by banning political demonstrations in two of the country's biggest provinces -- Punjab and Sindh. It also detained several hundred activists Wednesday. The political chaos has forced the government's attention away from a deadly fundamentalist insurgency in its tribal areas and an economy that's on the verge of collapse. To understand the reasons behind Pakistan's latest political chaos, one needs to keep three central characters in mind: . What do the lawyers want? The lawyers want President Zardari to live up to a promise to reinstate judges sacked by former President Musharraf. Musharraf fired about 60 judges when he declared a state of emergency in November 2007. The fired judges include 14 of 18 judges who sat on the Supreme Court, including Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry. Critics say Musharraf sacked the judges because they were preparing to rule against the legitimacy of his third term in office. He had been re-elected president by a parliament stacked with his supporters, they said. After sweeping into power in parliamentary elections last year, the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party promised to reinstate the judges within 30 days of taking office. The deadline came and went. Why have the judges not been reinstated? One reason behind the delay, some experts have surmised, may be that the Supreme Court was expected to look into the controversial amnesty granted to former PPP leader Benazir Bhutto and her husband and current party head, Zardari, for corruption charges. When Bhutto was prime minister, Zardari was accused many times of corruption, stealing from government coffers and accepting kickbacks. Pakistanis derisively labeled him ""Mr. 10 percent."" Zardari said the cases were politically motivated. He spent several years in jail on the charges but was never convicted. Bhutto herself faced corruption charges in at least five cases, but was not convicted. In October 2007, with his popularity plummeting and under pressure from the West to hold elections, Musharraf allowed Bhutto to return from exile and participate by granting her and her husband amnesty. Bhutto was assassinated during a campaign rally. Her husband became head of the party and the new president of Pakistan. Why is the opposition protesting? The country's second-biggest party, the Pakistan Muslim League -- N (PML-N), is led by opposition leader and former Prime Minister Sharif. Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that Sharif cannot hold public office, citing a criminal record that dates to the late 1990s. The court also stripped Sharif's brother, Shahbaz, from his post as chief minister of Punjab -- the Sharif party's power center. The Sharifs condemned the court's decision as politically motivated. They accuse the court of acting at the behest of Zardari. Adding to their outrage, Zardari suspended Punjab's parliament and imposed executive rule there for two months. The Zardari administration said the executive rule was needed to maintain stability in the province. Supporters of PML-N have rallied in large numbers opposing the ruling. Why did the court bar Nawaz Sharif from elected office? The case against Sharif dates to the late 1990s, when he was prime minister. At the time, Musharraf was military chief. And Sharif feared Musharraf was plotting his ouster. When Musharraf was returning home from an overseas trip, Sharif refused the airliner to land. That order eventually led to Sharif's conviction for hijacking and treason when Musharraf took power in a bloodless coup. Separately, Sharif also was convicted of corruption. He went into exile instead of prison, but returned to Pakistan to challenge Musharraf's rule in late 2007. However, the election commission barred Sharif from the parliamentary race. His brother, Shahbaz, was shut out because of financial irregularities, the commission said. The Supreme Court upheld the commission's decisions. What does the turmoil mean for Pakistan? The renewed tensions threaten to take the focus away from the government's attempts to quash an escalating pro-Taliban insurgency in the country. At the same time, Pakistan's economy is in shambles. The worsening security situation is part of the reason. Rising food and oil prices have also contributed to the crisis. In November, the International Monetary Fund approved a $7.6 billion loan to Pakistan to help the South Asian country of 170 million people avoid an economic collapse. Many in Pakistan worry that the latest turmoil could once again force the army on to the streets if it worsens. In its 61-year history, Pakistan has been under army rule more than half the time. For now, Gen. Ashfaq Kayani has said he will not interfere in political matters.","Pakistan's main opposition will join protests demanding reinstatement of judges .

"(CNN) -- A German supermarket employee got a surprise this week when she opened two boxes of bananas to find them filled with more than 60 pounds of cocaine worth $2 million, police said. Government-released photos show bananas and packages of what is identified as cocaine. ""This is obviously a matter of a logistical mistake,"" a spokesman for the Bavarian State Bureau of Investigation, based in Munich, told CNN Friday. A 26-year-old employee with the discount chain Lidl in the sleepy town of Illertissen was randomly checking the boxes on Wednesday morning, police said. The fresh bananas had just been taken off a food truck, an hour after the store was open, they said. The employee was suspicious of the boxes because they felt lighter than normal, police said. As she unpacked the bananas to take them into the store's produce section, police said, she found 26 small yellow parcels hidden underneath the fruit. She immediately called police. The investigators established that the substance is cocaine and confiscated the goods, police said. The cocaine totaled 28 kilos, or 61.7 pounds, police said. The German shipper who delivered the bananas also made stops at other stores in southern Germany, but police said no other box with cocaine had been found at those stores yet. The freight had come from Antwerp, Belgium, but originated from Colombia, police said. ""The drug courier obviously screwed up. He simply was not quick enough,"" the Bavarian State Bureau of Investigation spokesman said. He dubbed the finding a ""discovery by accident."" Police said they did not know why the shipment of illegal drugs was delivered to the particular store in Illertissen, halfway between Munich and Stuttgart. The town is right next to a major highway, a North-South route between Scandinavia in the north and Italy in the south. The freight might have been delivered to the wrong address, the spokesman said. Police were not releasing any further details because of their ongoing inquiries. They said they did not know if a drug cartel or a drug courier was using Illertissen as a hub.","Supermarket employee uncovers 28 kilograms worth of cocaine, police say .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Six U.S. soldiers were killed Wednesday in Iraq when a bomb exploded in a booby-trapped house while they were on patrol north of Baghdad, the military announced. U.S. soldiers conduct a house-to-house assessment mission in Baghdad on Wednesday. Four soldiers were also wounded in the attack and evacuated to a coalition forces hospital, Multi-National Corps-Iraq said. The troops were taking part in Operation Iron Harvest -- a new drive against Islamic militants in northern Iraq after a spate of attacks on local anti-insurgent groups. The operation is part of a nationwide push against jihadists loyal to al Qaeda in the provinces of Diyala, Salaheddin, Nineveh, and Tameem. ""It will be a difficult fight, but we will continue to execute simultaneous operations in each one of our four provinces,"" said Maj. Gen. Michael Hertling, commander of U.S. troops in northern Iraq. But resistance in the ""breadbasket"" region in eastern Diyala so far is ""less than anticipated,"" he said. The offensive -- which has been centered near Muqdadiya -- has left 20 to 30 suspected insurgents dead in the area around that city, Hertling said. About 24,000 U.S. troops, 50,000 Iraqi soldiers and 80,000 local police are based in the region. In addition, about 15,000 Iraqis are taking part in anti-insurgent groups known as Concerned Local Citizens or Awakening Councils. The groups will perform defensive security tasks during the operation, the U.S. military said. The new push comes just short of a year since President Bush ordered almost 30,000 additional troops to Iraq to secure Baghdad and its surrounding provinces. Al Qaeda in Iraq has been deeply rooted in Muqdadiya, about 62 miles north of Baghdad, since about 2004. Wednesday's deaths occurred in an agricultural area on the north side of the Diyala River from the city. The U.S. military has conducted operations there in the past and has frequently come under fire. One recent operation ended with several insurgents killed and a large amount of weapons and explosives seized, a military source told CNN. The bombing Wednesday was the first incident involving multiple deaths of U.S. soldiers in Iraq since September 10, when seven Multi-National Division-Baghdad soldiers died and 11 were injured in a vehicle accident in western Baghdad. The last attack in which so many U.S. troops died from hostile action happened May 28, when six Task Force Lightning soldiers were killed by explosions near their vehicles during operations in Diyala province. Awakening Councils . Iraq's concerned-citizens groups began forming in the country's predominantly Sunni Arab regions in late 2006, and their cooperation with U.S. forces against the jihadists has been credited with much of the decline in violence in Iraq since summer. But that cooperation has made them an increasing target for al Qaeda in Iraq, which Hertling said has launched a campaign of intimidation against the locals. Monday, five severed heads were left on a road leading to Baquba ""with Arabic writing in blood on the forehead which said, 'Join the Concerned Citizens and you will end up like this,' "" Hertling said. And he played video from an aerial surveillance drone that showed three people in Diyala assassinating another person -- pulling the victim from a vehicle, shooting him and leaving him in a ditch. They were eventually captured, and information was found linking them to al Qaeda in Iraq, he said. Hertling said that even though there has been a reduction in attacks across the country, there has been an increase in ""high-profile, spectacular"" events in his region, citing a suicide vest attack and a bridge bombing that sparked media attention and made the region look as if it were ""reeling."" But he said attacks like those will prove to be the jihadists' ""Achilles' heel,"" turning the population against them and driving them toward the concerned citizens' groups. ""It's sort of a reverse counterintuitive logic,"" Hertling said. ""They are trying to intimidate people that join them by killing them, and it's causing more people to go against them."" And Hertling said Nineveh -- home of the country's third-largest city, Mosul -- is an important geographic region because it borders Syria. Sunni militants long have crossed the border from Syria into Iraq to stage attacks, and Mosul's diverse, cosmopolitan population has made it an easy place for jihadist operatives to hide, he said.

"TALLAHASSEE, Florida (CNN) -- Softball, drunken orgies and a prison system run like the mafia. That's what Florida's former prison secretary says he inherited when he took over one of the nation's largest prison systems two years ago. This house, on prison grounds in Florida, is described as a party house where prison officials held orgies. In fact, on his first day on the job, James McDonough says he walked into his office -- the same one his predecessor used -- and there was crime scene tape preventing anyone from entering. ""That was an indication we had a problem in the department,"" McDonough told CNN in an exclusive interview before he stepped down last Thursday. McDonough revealed a startling list of alleged abuses and crimes going on inside Florida's prisons: . • Top prison officials admitting to kickbacks; . • Guards importing and selling steroids in an effort to give them an edge on the softball field; . • Taxpayer funds to pay for booze and women; . • Guards who punished other guards who threatened to report them. ""Corruption had gone to an extreme,"" McDonough said, saying it all began at the top. ""They seemed to be drunk half the time and had orgies the other half, when they weren't taking money and beating each other up.""  Watch a corrupted prison system » . He added, ""Women were treated like chattel in this department."" McDonough described a bizarre prison culture among those that ran the system -- one that he says seemed obsessed with inter-department softball games and the orgies after games. ""I cannot explain how big an obsession softball had become,"" he said. ""People were promoted on the spot after a softball game at the drunken party to high positions in the department because they were able to hit a softball out of the park a couple times."" ""The connection between the softball and the parties and the corruption and the beatings was greatly intertwined."" The parties and orgies were often carried out at a waterfront ranch house built on prison grounds for a former warden with taxpayer dollars, McDonough said. The house was complete with a bar, pool table and hot tub.  See photos of the ""party house"" » . McDonough is a former Army colonel who commanded troops in Vietnam and Africa. He served as Florida's drug czar before taking on the job as the head of Florida's prison system, which oversees 90,000 inmates. He left his post last Thursday as secretary of Florida's Department of Corrections because, he says, he feels he has cleaned up the corruption. It's time, he said, ""to turn this over to law and order people that have made this their life's goal."" A Brooklyn, New York, native, McDonough says he witnessed the way the mafia worked in his youth and it provided him a keen insight into how his prison predecessor, James Crosby, operated. ""It reminded me of the petty mafia I saw on the streets of Brooklyn when I was growing up in the late 1950s, early 1960s -- petty, small-minded, thugish, violent, dangerous, outside the law, and completely intolerable for a society such as ours in the United States of America,"" he said. Crosby would later plead guilty to bribery charges in relation to kickbacks from a prison vendor. He's now locked up in a federal prison. He refused CNN's request for an interview for this report. ""He's serving time in a federal prison. I hope he reforms and gets out and prospers,"" McDonough said. He added, ""When you have a rotten guy at the top, or gal at the top, it can be very invasive, and it's a cancer that needs to be excised."" And getting rid of this ""cancer"" is exactly what McDonough says he did. McDonough fired 90 top prison officials -- wardens, supervisors, colonels and majors -- claiming they were corrupt or, at the very least, not to be trusted. He demoted 280 others. Criminal charges were filed against more than 40 others, and most were convicted. In addition to the orgies and other misconduct outside the cell blocks, there were other allegations of prisoners being harmed, McDonough said. ""In some of the pockets of corruption that we found, they [prisoners] were being abused,"" he said. Among those arrested were seven officers accused of beating inmates, including five accused of forcing a prisoner to drink toilet water. All have pleaded not guilty. Tina Hayes, the director of the prison's department initiatives who has worked in the prison system for 28 years, said the atmosphere before McDonough arrived was ""a little tense"" with workers ""always on edge."" She said employees who didn't attend softball games or play on the teams were ""isolated"" and ""pushed aside."" ""I used to tell staff day in and day out: Keep your head high; do what's right; you know what morally is right; you've got some ethics; don't bow down to it,"" Hayes told CNN. McDonough, she said, brought ""standards back into the department."" ""People can speak out now without being afraid to say what they need to say."" McDonough says the majority of the prison system's 28,000 employees were honest, hard-working people who weren't corrupt at all. But he says many of the top prison officials weren't and he believes he has weeded out ""an organized vein of corruption."" ""They were like frat boys out of control.""

"(CNN) -- A lawyer for Howard K. Stern says the longtime partner of late sex symbol Anna Nicole Smith will fight conspiracy charges announced Thursday. Krista Barth, an attorney for Howard K. Stern, says it's not appropriate to talk publicly about details of the case. Stern was Smith's ""chief enabler,"" obtaining a variety of prescription drugs to keep the former Playboy model sedated and compliant, California Attorney General Jerry Brown said in announcing the charges against Stern and two doctors. Lisa Bloom of In Session and guest host Joy Behar questioned Stern's attorney Krista Barth Friday night on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" BEHAR: Did Howard see this all coming? BARTH: No, we did not see this coming. We knew that there was obviously the raid earlier on Dr. [Sandeep] Kapoor's office. But this was something that we honestly never expected.  Watch part of the discussion » . BEHAR: Well, they are very serious charges. There are so many counts here, eight felonies. Will he plead not guilty? What's he going to do? BARTH: Well, he will plead not guilty because he is not guilty. BEHAR: Now, the attorney general, Jerry Brown, called Stern ""the principal enabler"" in what he says was a conspiracy among three individuals. Do you have a reaction to that? BARTH: I think it's reminiscent of what happened at Duke. I don't think that this was something that should have been stated in a public forum. I think it's contrary to the rules of professional conduct regarding trial publicity. And you have to wonder why such a statement was made. But to say that something like that would not bias my client is beyond me. I can't even be -- I can't even venture a guess. BLOOM: Krista, the difference, though, between the Duke case and this case is that we know that she had at least 11 different medications in her system, the very same medications that are in this criminal complaint. We know that she was taking these drugs for years. We saw her zoned out of her mind with the slurred speech on her reality show and every awards show. So it was pretty common knowledge that Anna Nicole was an addict. And I think your client has even admitted that. There's a substantial amount of evidence here. It doesn't mean your client is guilty. But I think it's enough to raise eyebrows so that ever since she's died, people have wondered: How did she get all of those medications? How was it possible that doctors were giving her all that stuff? BARTH: The most basic tenet of our judicial system is that Mr. Stern is presumed innocent. ... And the concern that I have is that the public nature of the statements by the attorney general in the state of California is a bit troubling. And when I make the analogy to the Duke case, I think you're missing the point, in that that was done during an election campaign. There are sometimes political motivations for things that are done. You have to ask why is this case important to so many when what Attorney General Brown is talking about is a pervasive, over-prescription of prescription drugs. BEHAR: How much responsibility do the tabloids have in this case? I mean, it really was all over the place. BLOOM: I think that's going to be part of the defense, that they got prescriptions under false names because the tabloids were after her and they wanted every detail and she wanted some privacy. And as a celebrity, she may be entitled to that. I think that may be a valid defense as to why they were under false names. But there's no defense that I can see why thousands of pills. BEHAR: Krista, where did she get thousands of pills? BARTH: Well, you know what? Discussing the details of this is not appropriate. I think that the most important thing to focus on here is the way that our judicial system is supposed to work. I mean how often does that happen, that we're talking about a situation, you are not supposed to say, and I'm quoting here, something that you know reasonably should,  or reasonably should know will have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding in this matter?","California attorney general's comments are prejudicial, lawyer says .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A sculpture of a giant white horse taller than the Statue of Liberty is set to tower over the countryside as part of an unusual scheme to help revive the fortunes of a depressed region of England. The 50-meter high horse will dominate the landscape around Ebbsfleet. The 50-meter equine artwork was Tuesday announced as the winner of a competition to design a landmark to dominate the skyline of the Ebbsfleet Valley, set to be a new stop on the Eurostar London-to-Paris rail link. Designed by artist Mark Wallinger -- whose previous work has included dressing in a bear suit and wandering around a gallery in Berlin -- the £2 million ($3 million) horse will be one of the largest artworks in the UK. Wallinger's horse -- which echoes ancient white horse symbols carved into hillsides around Britain -- beat a shortlist of designs that included a tower of stacked cubes and giant steel nest. Victoria Pomery, head of the panel that selected the design, described the 33-times normal size horse as ""outstanding."" ""Mark is a superb artist of world renown and his sculpture will become a real landmark for Ebbsfleet Valley and the whole region,"" she said. It drew a less favorable response from readers of local Web site Kentnews.com, who described it as a ""waste of money,"" an ""abomination"" and ""depressing."" One correspondent, Andy Smith, added: ""This horse looks extremely silly.""","Giant horse announced as winner of competition to design new landmark .

"Editor's note: CNN writer Alan Duke has had two small voice-only roles in Tyler Perry's TV series, ""House of Payne,"" which airs on CNN's sister network TBS. He has had no relationship with Perry beyond observing him on set. Tyler Perry stars in ""Madea Goes to Jail,"" which is due out Friday. Perry is trying to expand his reach to Europe. ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Tyler Perry wants to take his character Madea to Europe, but he's been told that audiences there won't relate to his stories about African-American lives.  The films have made nearly $300 million at U.S. box offices. The challenge to conquer Europe has ""sat in my spirit,"" Perry wrote in a newsletter to his fans. Perry, who just a few years ago was homeless and broke, has made a fortune proving naysayers and critics wrong with a successful string of low-budget movies based on his Christian-themed stage plays. ""I was once told [by] someone that my movies only appeal to black people and no one else,"" Perry wrote. ""Now, I know that's not true."" When his first movie -- ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"" -- debuted in 2005, people who had seen his stage plays in person or on DVD flocked to theaters, making it the week's top movie with almost $22 million in ticket sales. Critics, who consistently pan Perry's productions, were confounded. ""They think I don't know what I am doing,"" he said in a CNN interview. ""They think that this is all haphazard, that I am some sort of idiot or something.""  Watch Perry sound off on ""Madea"" and other topics » . Perry said he does not write to please the critics, but for a broad audience of all ages. With six films already out and a seventh -- ""Madea Goes To Jail"" -- coming soon, Perry has never made a box office flop. His movies average nearly $22 million on opening weekends and almost $47 million in total domestic sales. ""Tyler Perry has a definite and growing fan base in this country and it's simply a matter of, can he create and grow a fan base in other countries,"" said independent producer Alex Franklin. Franklin -- a former development executive at Lionsgate, the film company that distributes Perry's films in the United States -- was the first person at that studio to read his script for ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman."" He agrees that Perry's movies should sell in Europe, but he said there is a tendency by distributors there to avoid films about African-Americans and films without major American stars who are well-known in Europe. While Perry's casts have included Angela Bassett, Janet Jackson and Kathy Bates, many of his characters, including Madea, come from his stage plays, which are known only to a mostly black American audience. But David Mann -- who is ""Mr. Brown"" in Perry's productions -- said he has seen the audience broaden since the early years of the stage plays. ""I can recall when we first started, I would say 90 to 95 percent of the audience would be African-American,"" Mann said. ""But now, you look out there and it's like, 'Wow! It's just a rainbow.' "" Perry, in his message to fans, said he sees his stories as universal. ""I know that even though I write from an African-American experience and most of the time I have an all-African-American cast, that doesn't mean that other people from other walks of life can't relate,"" he said. ""I think that any human being who goes through what we all go through can relate to my films. ""I know and remember that when I'm writing,"" he continued. ""But when this person said that to me, they also said Europeans would never relate, and that sat in my spirit."" Perry said he flew to Europe in January -- ""to find out for myself"" -- with visits to Rome, Madrid and London. It was there that he wrote his letter to his American fans. ""So far, all of us seem to be pretty much the same,"" he said. ""We love to laugh, we all have problems, we all want love, and we all have a church in every country. And since these are the things I usually write about, I don't see how that statement can be true. Do you?"" Perry could get his answer soon. Lionsgate has not said if ""Madea Goes To Jail,"" which debuts Friday, will be marketed to European audiences. But the company signed a joint venture deal last year with Eros International, an Indian film company, to distribute its films in India -- the second largest English-speaking market in the world. If that arrangement does not take Madea around the world, then perhaps Perry will try it on his own, Franklin said. ""He has the money to back up his intentions,"" he said. ""He proved his naysayers wrong in America, with his will and perseverance. There's no reason he can't do the same overseas."" CNN's Kara Yates and KJ Matthews contributed to this report.","Tyler Perry hoping to find market for his films in Europe .
