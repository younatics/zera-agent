"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated Press Reporter . More police officers have died from Ground Zero illness contracted during the rescue and recovery operations at the World Trade Center than were killed in the September 11 terrorist attacks, officials have revealed. The shocking news shows that the death toll from the destruction of the Twin Towers continues to rise - more than 12 years after the fact. The names of 20 more officers were added to a granite memorial for first responders in Albany, New York, on Tuesday, bringing the total death toll to 71. Rising death toll: Sixty police officers were killed in the 9/11 attacks - 71 have no died from Ground Zero illnesses they contracted from working in the debris of the World Trade Center . Six died last year, four in 2012, and three before that. According to authorities, the 13 of the 20 new causalities died from . cancers attributed to rescue and recovery work at the collapsed World . Trade Center towers in Manhattan. By contrast, 60 police officers were killed on September 11, 2001 after they rushed into the World Trade Center before it collapsed. Ground Zero illness is a catch-all term used to describe the cancers, respiratory problems and other diseases that researchers say effect thousands of people who worked at Ground Zero in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. The dust and debris from the wreckage of the World Trade Center has been described as 'wildly toxic. Workers at Ground Zero breathed in a mixture of pulverized glass, cellulose, asbestos, lead and mercury - combined with dioxins and other contaminants from the smoke of the burning wreckage. The result, say suffers and several public health experts, is a higher rate of cancer and a slew of other diseases in the people who were exposed to Ground Zero in the months after the attacks. The government slowly began to recognize Ground Zero illness after the 2006 death of 34-year-old NYPD Detective James Zadroga. In 2011, President Barack Obama signed a law - the James Zadroga Act - that created a $4.2billion program to provide health care to Ground Zero illness sufferers. 'I live . near the World Trade Center. I inhaled the toxic smoke that permeated . every square inch of lower Manhattan,' New York State Assembly Speaker . Sheldon Silver said. 'I . know how nobly and heroically the NYPD carried out their duties on that . tragic September day and the terrible days that followed.' Silver addressed hundreds of police, relatives and officials who gathered for the annual remembrance ceremony Tuesday at the memorial located in the Empire State Plaza in downtown Albany to honor officers who died from duty-related causes. He acknowledged it was small condolence for surviving families that the experience of what their loved ones endured will prevent a similar fate for other first responders. After the ceremony, several declined to talk, saying both the ceremony and what they’d experienced were difficult. For those who died later as a consequence of the trade center attacks, it has also meant several years of disabling injuries and illness, Lieutenant Governor Robert Duffy said. More than half of the 1,360 names on the wall were members of the NYPD, he said. Also added this year were the names of four state troopers, a Buffalo officer who died last year from a gunshot wound she received responding to a 911 call from a convenience store in 2006, a Yates County deputy killed in 1957 and a state conservation game protector killed in 1914.","A total of 71 police officers have died from illnesses linked to inhaling toxic dust and smoke from Ground Zero .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . The University of Connecticut is banning a sorority after reports of hazing straight out of the film Dazed and Confused. Kappa Kappa Gamma was put on suspension in March after hosting a party with Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity in which sophomore Hillary Holt was hospitalized for alcohol poisoning. In addition to being forced to drink beer, wine and shots  until she blacked out, Holt says she and other members were ordered to lie on the floor and pretend to 'sizzle like bacon,' imitating a famous scene from the film. Scroll down for video . Time to leave: Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority has been banned from the University of Connecticut following reports of hazing . Dangerous game: Sophomore Hillary Holt was at a party in march in which she was forced to drink beer, wine and shots until she passed out and work up in the hospital with three times the legal limit of alcohol in her system . In the scene, a group of high school women haze the incoming freshman girls by making them lie on the ground a roll around while they yell: 'Fry like bacon you little piggies!' The university made an official decision to drop the sorority from campus on Wednesday, with a letter sent to the chapter president. 'UConn has zero tolerance for hazing and all similarly harmful behaviors, and repeatedly makes those expectations clear to all student leaders in Greek life and other organizations,' school spokeswoman Stephanie Reitz said in an email. Just like in the movies: Holt also says that she and other members were ordered to lie on the ground and 'sizzle like bacon' in a scene straight out of the film Dazed and Confused where a group of graduating high school seniors haze the incoming freshman girls . Embarrassing: In the scene, a senior orders the incoming freshman girls to lie on the ground while she screams: 'Fry like bacon you little piggies!' 'The university's decision to revoke Kappa Kappa Gamma's registration and recognition was not taken lightly, but it was appropriate and imperative in light of the severity of the circumstances. The sorority's national chapter issued a . statement in March saying it does not tolerate hazing and ""will continue . to be an advocate for anti-hazing education across the country."" The chapter may reapply as a student organization in four years. SAE will learn if they are allowed to stay on campus at a meeting next week. KKG has until 4pm on May 15 to vacate it's current on-campus house and until May 14 to file an appeal. In March, Holt gave an interview with WFSB, explaining the details of the raucous hazing party. Holt said she drank so much she blacked out and woke up in the hospital where she was told her blood-alcohol level was nearly three times the limit of 0.08. Up in the air: The Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity was also suspended and will learn if they are allowed to stay on campus at a meeting next week . 'You have seven to nine people yelling at you, girls and guys, and if you don't do what they tell you to, the consequences could get worse,' Holt said. At the time, SAE national spokesman Brandon Weghorst issued a statement saying the party was 'not consistent with out expectation. SAE just changed a crucial policy this year, eliminating the pledging process in an effort to 'address some of these issues'. Pledging is the process of becoming a new member of a Greek organization and the process can often involve doing dangerous or embarrassing tasks in fraternity recruitment. According to a recent report in Bloomberg, SAE is the deadliest U.S. fraternity. The school also is investigating hazing charges against three other Greek organizations. Delta Zeta, Delta Gamma and Sigma Chi were placed on interim suspension in April amid allegations that men were forced during off-campus parties to eat dog treats, paint their bodies, wear women's underwear and take alcohol shots off each other's bodies.","Kappa Kappa Gamma hosted a party in March in which members were forced to drink alcohol and perform demeaning tasks .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A commuter heading into Boston in a car-pooling lane has been cited after a trooper spotted a mustachioed mannequin in the passenger seat. State Trooper John Carnell was working a paid detail in Quincy, Massachusetts, this morning when he saw a vehicle enter the carpool lane on Interstate 93 north with a suspicious-looking passenger. Carnell pulled over the vehicle and found that indeed, the driver was attempting to pass off a dummy as a human in a bid to get through traffic faster. What a dummy: A commuter heading into Boston has been cited after a trooper spotted a mustachioed mannequin, pictured, in the passenger seat . The mannequin head was propped up a jacket in the passenger seat of the car. The fake head even had a little mustache drawn on. Vehicles using the lane must have at least two occupants. The driver, whose name was not made public, has been issued a citation for operating on an excluded way. The duo were spotted at approximately 6:35 a.m. by Carnell, who immediately knew the dummy was a 'counterfeit passenger.' Traffic: Heavy traffic on the 93, pictured, is forcing commuters to take drastic, mustachioed measures . When he pulled the car over, Carnell found the driver 'had propped up a work jacket with a mannequin head affixed to the top of the jacket in an attempt to create the illusion of a true passenger.' 'The purpose of the HOV (high occupancy vehicle) lane is to alleviate the number of cars on the roadway during the morning and evening commute times. This is accomplished by encouraging carpooling,' state police said. According to Boston Globe, Carnell is something of an expert when it comes to detecting fake humans in car-pooling lanes. In April 2013, he stopped a vehicle because 'a woman had placed a full size doll in a car seat' in an attempt to out smart the system.","State Trooper John Carnell saw a vehicle enter the carpool lane on Interstate 93 north near Quincy, Massachusetts, this morning .

"By . Associated Press . and Alex Greig . Police in central Georgia on Wednesday are investigating the beheading of an elderly man and are also searching for his wife, who they fear has been abducted from the couple’s lakefront home. Friends of Russell and Shirley Dermond found the body of 88-year-old Russell Dermond in the garage of the $1million home Tuesday and called the police, Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills said. They went looking after not hearing from the couple for days. County coroner Gary P. McElhenney said that the man had been decapitated. Police believe the attack happened sometime between Friday and Sunday, Sills said. Mystery: Police are unsure who killed Russell Dermond (left) or where his wife Shirley Dermond (right) is . Quiet area: Sheriff Howard Sills said there hasn't been a break-in in the gated, guarded community for 18 years, and the Dermond's home bore no signs of forced entry or struggle . Shirley Dermond, 87, was not at the home when authorities arrived at the home in the Great Waters and investigators believe she may have been abducted. 'I do not believe this to be a random attack and I base that on several things,' Sills told WSB-TV. 'No evidence of forced entry or struggle or things like that.' Shirley Dermond is described as five feet two inches tall and 148 pounds. She has gray hair and blue eyes. She is not considered a suspect in her husband’s death, Sills said. The bizarre attack has detectives baffled and police are deeply concerned for the safety of Shirley Dermond. Lakeside idyll: The Dermonds lived quietly in their waterfront home and were described by their pastor as a 'sweet' and 'unassuming' couple . Unexplained: Police believe the perpetrator may have accessed the Dermonds' home by the water and that the attack was isolated and premeditated . Nothing . appeared to have been stolen from the home, with the couple's cell . phones, cars and other valuable items found still in the home. 'I'm not optimistic given the fact of her husband's circumstances, holding out hope for the family,' Sills said. 'We . still approach this as if she's been abducted and we pray that she is . alive but we don't know anything about where Ms. Dermond is.' Sills . said it's very difficult to track where Shirley Dermond might have gone . since her cell phone, wallet and car were all left behind. No weapon was recovered from the attack. The couple's children have traveled to their home while police investigate. One of the the Dermonds' sons, Bradley Dermond, described his parents Wednesday as 'salt of the Earth.' Concern: Neighbors became worried after not seeing the couple for days and discovered the headless body of Russell Dermond in the garage and Shirley Dermond missing . 'This absolutely makes no sense at all,' he told USA Today. 'We're still hoping that our mother is OK.' Sills added that authorities are investigating whether the attacker may have approached the couple’s home from the lake. 'This is a huge lake,' he said. 'It spans four counties and entry could’ve been made by the lake.' The home is located in the gated Great Waters community on Lake Oconee, a guarded, gated community with no public access. According to 2013 tax records the couple's home, boat dock and land is worth $1,043,094. The Dermonds move to the home from Atlanta after he retired. He used to own fast food franchises. Neither of the couple had any history of mental illness nor known health problems. The couple has three children, two sons and a daughter, all of whom live out of state and are cooperating with investigators. The last contact any of the children had with their parents was April 29th. Sills told Channel 2 that there hasn't been a home invasion in the area for 18 years. The Dermonds' neighbors are shocked that such a violent crime had been committed against the couple. 'We were all in shock and we really just don't know how they'd have any enemies or anybody who'd want to do anything to them,' the Reverend David Key of Oconee Lake Community Church told USA Today. 'They're the last couple that you would think anybody would break in and do this kind of violence to.'","Russel Dermond, 87, was found decapitated in his lakefront home and his wife Shirley Dermond, 88, is missing .

"By . Francesca Chambers . The maker of Wonder Bread is the most likely company in America to give to Republican causes, the New York Times has discovered. Wonder Bread owner Flower Foods has donated singularly to Republican candidates for the past 20 years, according to Federal Election Commission data. Flower Foods does not give the most money to Republicans', however. The baked goods company gave only one-tenth of what Koch Industries' PAC gave to Republicans during the 2012 election cycle, and it has handed out only one donation since. Flower Foods - the maker of Wonder Bread - is more likely to donate to Republicans than any other company in America . Flower Foods is best known as the owner of Wonder Bread, the brand it acquired last year after previous owner Hostess Brands went out of business. The Georgia based company also produces bread brands Country Kitchen, Home Pride and Nature's Pride, among others, and snack foods brands Tastykake and Mrs. Freshley's. The publicly traded company is not overtly Republican. Unlike Koch Industries, its owners are not Republican activists. The former family owned company is no longer managed by any direct descendents of the Flowers. The late Langdon S Flowers retired from the company in 1985. The company's employees are clearly Republicans, however. The Times concluded that employees who list Flowers Foods at their employer had given less than $5,000 in personal contributions to Democrats since the late '80s. Republicans were the recipients of a whopping $509,000 or more of employee's cash. The baked goods company has given more than $1.8 million to Republican candidates since 1990, data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics shows. During the same period, it gave $11,500 to Democrats. The last time Flower Foods' PAC gave to Democrats was during the Republican Revolution of 1994. The following election cycle, the group gave $242,500 to Republicans - more than it has given in any single cycle since. Center for Responsive Politics' Open Secrets site only show data dating back to 1990, so it is unclear how the company gave to Republicans or Democrats prior to the '90s, but the Times reports that it has donated to Republicans more than 99 percent of the time since 1979. Flower Foods did not respond to a request for comment from the Times on its giving. The company has only given to one candidate since 2012 as of the latest FEC filing report, and that was Republican Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina. It gave Sanford $2,500 in the 2013 special election that put him back in the congressional office he'd held for three terms more than a decade before. KochPAC has already given $816,000 to Republican candidates ahead of November's elections and $12,000 to Democrats, Open Secrets shows. It spent nearly as much on Republican causes in 2012 as Flower Foods has spent in the last 24 years combined. Surprisingly, Koch Industries has given only 88.1 percent of its PAC money to Republicans. Other major donors to Republican causes are Illinois Tool Works, Westingonhouse brand owner Eaton and Bloomin Brands, which owns Outback Steakhouse and Carrabbas Italian Grill. All three have contributed to Republicans over Democrats at a more than 9 to 1 ratio. Citizen's Financial Group has favored Democrats most, giving 77.5 percent of it's $1 million to Democrats, the Times reports.","Flower Foods' PAC as not given to a Democratic candidate since 1994 .

"By . Ashley Collman . Arrested: Teen mom Violet Hinrichs, 19, was arrested last week after police caught her on hospital surveillance video abusing her 7-month-old son . A teen mom in Florida was arrested last week for chocking her 7-month-old baby to the point of seizures. Staff at St Joseph's Children's Hospital in Tampa alerted police after they noticed bruising on the neck of an infant named Danny, being monitored for seizures and sleep apnea. Police reviewed surveillance footage taken in the hospital and noticed several instances where Danny's 19-year-old mother Violet Hinrichs squeezed him so hard he passed out. The Port Richey woman was arrested April 29 and charged with four counts of child abuse and is currently being held on $80,000 bond. Authorities say the surveillance footage showed Hinrichs picking up Danny from his crib and squeezing him so hard he began to flail, turn blue and then become unresponsive. Hinrichs brought Danny into the hospital about three weeks before her arrest, saying the boy was experiencing seizures and sleep apnea. She appeared loving when she shared progress of the boy's treatment online with her Facebook friends. 'Wanted to update every one on Danny. He is being treated for seizures. In the past 24 hrs he had 6 with 2 lasting longer than 6 minutes...Please keep him in your prayers. If he does ok on these meds we will go home Sunday night,' she wrote on April 18. Sick? Hinrichs' son Danny had been in the hospital for about three weeks before her arrest, under observation for sleep apnea and seizures. The 7-month old hasn't had a single seizure since being separated from Hinrichs. Pictured above in photos posted on Hinrichs' Facebook . Sympathy card: Hinrichs' sister says she has the mental capacity of an eight year old and may be suffering from Munchausen syndrome . But after her arrest last week, she copped to police that she was responsible for the baby's injuries. Danny hasn't had a single seizure since being separated from his mother. Hinrichs' sister Tiffany Coffey expressed shock over the abuse accusations and says her sister has always been good with the baby. 'I don't know why she would do this. I don't understand how any human could do that to a child,' Coffey told My Fox Tampa on Wednesday. But she says her sister does have a learning disability, leaving her with the mental capacity of an eight year old. Those who suffer from Munchausen syndrome make up illnesses to gain sympathy from others. Danny will be placed in foster care once released from the hospital . She believes her sister may be suffering from Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Munchausen syndrome is a psychiatric disorder where those affected make up illnesses to gain sympathy from others. After Danny is released from the hospital, he will be put in the protection of foster care. Coffey says that Hinrichs had another child before Danny a few years ago, but the child was put up for adoption at birth because her sister was too young. Hinrichs reportedly lives with her mother, and Pasco County child protective investigators have been called to the property before.","Violet Hinrichs was caught on hospital surveillance video squeezing infant son Danny until he passed out .

"By . Associated Press . Oklahoma's attorney general agreed today to a six-month stay of execution for a death row inmate while an investigation is conducted into last week's botched lethal injection. Attorney General Scott Pruitt's office said it wouldn't object to a 180-day stay of execution being sought by attorneys for inmate Charles Warner while the investigation is underway. Warner was scheduled for execution on the same night last week as Clayton Lockett in what would have been the state's first double execution since 1937. Murderer and rapist Clayton Lockett (left) and convicted murderer and rapist Charles Warner (right).  Lockett died of a heart attack on April 29 more than 40 minutes after his execution was halted due to a botched lethal injection, leading Oklahoma to postpone the execution of Warner . But Lockett's vein collapsed during his lethal injection, prompting prison officials to halt the execution. He later died of a heart attack. Gov. Mary Fallin then issued a two-week stay of execution for Warner, but his attorneys asked for a six month delay. Pruitt's office agreed in a motion filed with the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, and if the court agrees, Warner's execution would be postponed until November 13. 'Should additional time be needed for the implementation of any changes or adjustments, the state will request it,' Assistant Attorney General Seth Branham wrote. Lockett writhed on the gurney, gritted his teeth, lifted his head several times and moaned before dying of an apparent heart attack 43 minutes after the start of his execution. A doctor inside the death chamber during the execution reported that Lockett's vein collapsed and some of the lethal drugs were absorbed into his tissue or leaked out. The curtains that allow witnesses to view the execution were closed about 16 minutes into the lethal injection, after Lockett had been showing signs of distress for several minutes. The director of the state's prison system, Robert Patton, then called off the execution, but Lockett died about 10 minutes later. Patton released a report saying Lockett had an intravenous tap placed at his groin because suitable veins couldn't be found elsewhere in his body. That vein collapsed, and Patton said Lockett didn't have another viable one - and that the state didn't have another dose of the drugs available. The former warden of Oklahoma State Penitentiary said on Wednesday that Lockett's painful death was not 'botched' but probably due to his on actions of cutting his arms, refusing food and not drinking water so that he was too dehydrated for officials to find a viable vein. Randall Workman, who retired in 2012, told The Edmond Sun: 'It was an untimely execution. It worked. He died. The bottom line is the drugs did what they were supposed to do. They killed him.'","Attorney General Scott Pruitt's office .

"By . Associated Press . Raonel Valdez-Valhuerdis (pictured), 34, was booked into the Miami-Dade County Jail on Wednesday . A man accused of stealing more than 100 pounds of gold worth nearly $3 million in South Florida is back in the U.S. after being captured in Belize. Raonel Valdez-Valhuerdis, 34, was booked into the Miami-Dade County Jail on Wednesday, the U.S. Marshalls Service reported. He was detained in February by Belize immigration officials at the Guatemala-Belize border. He was spotted crawling through bush scrub by the Guatemala border and was carrying a Cuban passport, CNN reported. Authorities say Valdez and two other men robbed a Bolivian export company employee outside a Coral Gables apartment building in Miami in October 2012. The gold, worth an estimated $2.8 million, was on its way to an Opa-Locka refinery when he allegedly held up a man carrying the gold in suitcases. Valdez was arrested shortly after the robbery. Valdez was free on $75,000 bail in March 2013 when authorities lost track of his GPS monitor, and he disappeared. He was wearing an ankle monitor from a previous arrest at the time of his capture. Valdez allegedly assaulted and tried to rob his ex-girlfriend five months prior to the gold heist. He was ordered to wear the ankle monitor after being convicted of battery.

"By . Louise Boyle . A Romanian couple who committed an alleged $68million tax evasion . left behind up to $2.7million in gold and silver coins in a vast . network of sealed bunkers on their rural Washington estate, new court . documents have revealed. Radu Nemes, 39, and his wife Diana, . 38, built a network of bunkers and passages and filled them with . stockpiles of money and food at their home, set on 53 acres in Yelm. Investigators found 88 gold coins and 10,500 silver coins however two neighbors admitted to helping the couple bury a large stash of loot on the property. The FBI have searched the land with radar but still $3million remains missing. The Nemes' bunker could be sealed from the inside on the rural Yelm property and was stockpiled with goods. The FBI believe that $3million in gold and silver coins is still buried on the land in Washington, according to new court documents . Radu Nemes, 39, and his wife Diana, 38, are being extradited to Romania to face charges that they dodged millions in fuel taxes . The fascinating details emerged in . recently-unsealed FBI documents on the alleged Romanian fraudsters. The . couple were arrested in March after being accused of working with . corrupt politicians in their home country on the massive tax dodge. Mrs . Nemes, who is reportedly pregnant with her third child, has been . extradited to Romania. Radu Nemes' also waived extradition but has not . been moved. The couple had accrued a number of . properties, including a $3million log cabin, and number of businesses in . Washington which are believed to have been paid for with laundered . money. Millions was also construction equipment and at least one yacht. Mr Nemes and his wife Diana, poured thousands of dollars into building the elaborate bunker. The couple have two other sons, aged eight and nine. The shelter could be sealed from the inside and had food, water filtration systems, a back-up generator, a working kitchen and practical supplies to live for months. A stash of four pistols and two rifles including an AR-15-style assault rifle were found at the home. Investigators searching the property with radar equipment discovered a 'fully equipped and furnished underground bunker'. 'That bunker could comfortably have housed the entire family for months if not years, given the supply of food found in storage in that structure,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Norman Barbosa said in court papers. The FBI also reported that the Nemes had been traveling the U.S. on first-class flights. They spent more than $200,000 at designer boutiques and blew hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash. The couple allegedly moved their 70-ft yacht – the Ramaya – from the Mediterranean in late 2012. It was sold months later for $2.3million. Newly-released FBI photos reveal an elaborate bunker that a pair of fugitive Romanian tax cheats secretly built. Inside was stockpiles of water and food . The bunker, which was stacked with chemicals and food supplies, was discovered by the FBI last month using radar equipment . The Nemes, who arrived in the U.S. in 2012 after reportedly fleeing their native Romania following charges of tax evasion, settled in the quiet town, far out west. It is then that they became members of the Ramtha School of Enlightenment (RSE). The . RSE was established by female leader J.Z. Knight, a business school . drop-out from Roswell, New Mexico, who claims to channel messages from a . 35,000-year-old warrior. Her spiritual method claims to bring . together ancient wisdom with the power of consciousness and the latest . scientific discoveries. Ms Knight, (the J.Z. stands for Judy Zebra), . a 68-year-old who has three marriages under her belt, holds retreats . for her followers on private land attached to her French chateau-style . mansion. In 2007, her business filed profits of $2.6million from retreats, books, CDs and DVD sales. The bunker could be sealed from the inside and could support the couple for months on the rural land . The FBI came across a fully-stocked bunker complete with functioning kitchen on land owned by two Romanian fugitives in Washington . The industrial bunker could have housed a family for months, if not years, the FBI said this week . A . former business partner of the Nemes, Doug McCrea, told MailOnline that despite being evidently very wealth, the couple were quiet . and unassuming. He . said occasionally the couple came for a glass of wine at his bar but . kept to themselves. He described Mrs Nemes as a 'petite blonde' who came . across as a very nice person. Court documents show that the Nemes also bought a home in Thurston . County, and were allegedly in the process of building a lavish property on the grounds with the . illegal funds, according to investigators. They also owned a a . restaurant and a large commercial property in Yelm. A promotional poster from J.Z. Knight who founded the Ramtha School of Enlightenment in 1988 in Yelm, Washington . Radu Nemes and his wife were arrested . by the FBI late last month and are facing extradition to Romania to face . charges that they colluded with a high-ranking . official to dodge millions in fuel taxes. According to filings, Radu Nemes . allegedly worked as part of a criminal gang to illegally import 1million . tons of diesel fuel and sell it in Romania through shell companies . between 2011 and 2012. The shell companies were set up in names of homeless people to distance the Nemes from the fraud. The massive tax dodge came by importing the fuel for manufacturing purposes then selling it directly to consumers. Diana Nemes allegedly helped her . husband by laundering money from the fuel scheme through Dubai accounts . and then bringing it into the U.S. A . spokesman for the Ramtha school issued a statement to MailOnline in . March saying the school 'has no information about allegations from the . Romanian government or the student referenced'. A Romanian couple accused in a plot to dodge $73 million in oil taxes in Romania were arrested this week while living in Yelm in rural Washington state . Ramtha's School of Enlightenment, which claims roots in the teachings of a 35,000-year-old warrior from a mystical land, was founded 26 years ago by a business school drop-out from Roswell, New Mexico. JZ Knight (born Judith Darlene Hampton in 1946) is the spiritual school's 'high priestess' after she claims that she was visited in 1977 by an entity named Ramtha, an ancient warrior who channels his teachings through her. Followers participating in an event at Ramtha's School of Enlightenment . Ramtha, the 'Enlightened One', marries ancient wisdom with neuroscience and quantum physics to allow followers to access their own 'direct channel' with God. Between 1979 and 1988, Knight traveled the U.S. having private 'dialogues' with students. In 1988, Ramtha's School of Enlightenment was founded on former ranch land in Yelm, a small city in rural Washington state. It is . an 'academy of the mind that offers retreats and workshops to people of . all ages and cultures', according to its official website . By 1995, Ramtha's school had an international reputation. J.Z. Knight was touring Australia, Italy, Japan and South Africa to spread her message of how students can use their brain power to 'Become a Remarkable Life'. The school has a 80-acre fenced compound, not open to the public, which is the site of retreats for students and staff. The 68-year-old religious guru's company, JZK Inc. posted profits of $2.6million in 2007 from these courses along with books, tapes and DVDs. In 2008, Ramtha's School of Enlightenment spread to 20 more countries including the Czech Republic, Romania and Chile.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Anna Wintour is well known for her frosty exterior, so it should come as no surprise that she has openly admitted she can't stand being hugged. The steely Vogue editor and chairman of the annual Met Gala joined Sarah Jessica Parker on Late Night with Seth Meyers to discuss the trials and tribulations of co-hosting fashion's biggest night of the year. 'The worst is the people who you've never met before if your life before, that want to hug you in a major embrace,' Ms Wintour, 64, remarked, demonstrating a bear hug of her own. 'You just have to step back and say ""How do you do?""' Scroll down for video . Anna Wintour, editor of Vogue and chairman of the annual Meta Gala, demonstrated an unwanted bear hug during her appearance with Sarah Jessica Parker on Late Night with Seth Meyers . In the lively ten minute interview, the power duo boasted that they had raised a record-breaking $12 million for the Metropolitan Museum of Art and cracked jokes with Seth Meyers in a rare - in Ms Wintour's case - show of playfulness. Ms Jessica Parker, former star of Sex and the City, commenced by revealing that her role at the Gala was far from easy. '[I was required to be] somewhat presentable... not embarrass the institution,' she said, gesturing overtly at Ms Wintour, before adding that she was 'reprimanded very early on' by the fierce editor. Game tactics: Ms Wintour revealed her tactics to fend off an awkward embrace, step back and say 'How do you do?' instead . Fashion chums: Viewers got the rare chance so see a more playful side of the revered editor, who joked merrily with Ms Jessica Parker throughout the interview . 'She talks . too much!' exclaimed Ms Wintour, quickly cutting in and explaining that . guests arriving at the event were quick to 'rush away' from her after a . brief handshake, but stuck around to chat with the 'polite' Ms Jessica . Parker. The actress, who looked ravishing in a yellow floral dress and turquoise cardigan, marveled at Ms Wintour's ability to keep greetings brief. 'She offers a hospitable hand, and without any words is able to communicate that that's all that will happen,' she relayed, adding that the dramatic white gloves she wore for the evening were filthy in the 'sober light' of morning, from all the handshakes she too had exchanged. Collapse! The power duo revealed that Ms Jessica Parker was so 'exhausted' at one point that she dropped to the floor, in what Ms Wintour described as 'the chicest collapse I'd ever seen' (pictured) Ms Wintour . went on to compare a few of her previous co-hosts, including Oprah . Winfrey, whom guests actually 'curtsied' for, and Hollywood hunk George . Clooney. 'The . women just would not leave his side,' she recalled, also revealing that . he had the 'best' introduction line for greeting people at the event. 'Hello, . I'm George Clooney, and I'm running for congress. Do I have your vote?' he allegedly said to arriving guests - which was met with a rapturous applause from the audience. Belle of the ball: Ms Jessica Parker looked sensational at this year's Gala in a dramatic Oscar de la Renta creation (pictured) Another highlight was Ms Wintour's revelation that Ms Jessica Parker was so 'exhausted' during the lavish event that she 'just collapsed on the floor.' 'It was the chicest collapse I'd ever seen!' she joked. The pair also discussed Ms Wintour's choice of dress code this year, which was 'white tie and diamonds' - a theme she picked to 'turn the tables' and make it harder for men who usually only have to have to come in a black tux. 'I had no idea how much panic it would create!' she admits, adding that designer Tom Ford received 'hundreds' of emails from men trying to clarify what they should wear. On trend: Ms Wintour opted for a textured, floral Chanel dress which she accessorized (aptly) with diamonds . They then proceeded to judge a few of the male guests' outfits. Tom Brady was attacked for not embracing the theme 'at all', although Ms Wintour interjected: 'Well he has Gisele, so that helps.' Hugh Jackson was mocked for his 'white tropical' dinner jacket, Mr Meyers was scolded for not having 'tails', Kanye West was declared 'almost perfect' and Bradley Cooper stole the show in the discerning eyes of Ms Wintour. 'My punk days are behind me' Mr Meyers pointed out that last year's theme, as chosen by the woman herself, was punk and that Ms Wintour had completely ignored it, opting for a floral dress instead. Her response was quick and elegantly delivered. 'Seth, my punk days are behind me.'","The pair revealed on Late Night with Seth Meyers that Ms Jessica Parker was so 'exhausted' on the night, she 'collapsed'

Erica and James Packer were pictured together for the first time since they separated last year as they attended the funeral of Australian billionaire Paul Ramsay and the couple seemed to be on very good terms. The 36-year-old model and her beleaguered ex-husband, 46, were seen boarding a private helicopter to fly down to Bowral to attend the funeral early on Friday morning.

Erica Packer's forgotten singing career: Billionaire James Packer's ex-wife dabbled in music... just like Miranda Kerr . Paul Ramsay was a businessman and philanthropist who died at the age of 78.

Mr Packer got in a public fist fight with his friend, Nine Network Chairman David Gyngell on Sunday . Paul Ramsay passed away on May 1 at the age of 78 after it was believed he suffered a heart attack while sailing in Spain . Shortly after the Packers took seats in the pews, former prime minister John Howard and wife Jeannette arrived and signed the register. Mr Ramsay was  a devoted supporter of the Liberal Party and in 2011-2012 he was its biggest donor, contributing more than $600,000 to the party. Governor-General Peter Cosgrove and his wife Lady Lynne arrived at the chapel just before 11 o'clock and gave a polite smile to the crowd gathered outside. During the funeral Prime Minister Abbott, gave a brief eulogy. 'Here's the thing, Paul built a business empire but he never lost his soul,' he said. 'He was the most un-Scrooge like billionaire Australia has ever seen.' Former prime minister John Howard said the late medical entrepreneur had a 'radiant decency' during a speech he made to the mourners off the cuff. 'He epitomised ethical capitalism,' said Mr Howard. 'His business acumen in not only private health but in media was well respected. He was an inspirational Australian and there is I think no finer epitaph.' Members of the public also turned up to catch a glimpse of the star-studded funeral. 'I hope I get a seat, there's a lot of celebrities in today,' said local Innika.

Paul Ramsay, 78, was the founder and chairman of Ramsay Health Care, a private hospital operator. Ramsay Healthcare has more than 150 hospitals in Australia, the UK, Indonesia, Malaysia and France. Mr Ramsay was valued at $3.7 billion by Forbes in March. He was an ardent support of the Liberal Party and of former prime minster John Howard. Mr Ramsay was the party's most significant donor in 2011-2012, giving $605,000 one year. It was announced on April 24 that he was admitted to hospital in a serious condition, it was believed that he suffered a heart attack in Spain while sailing. Mr Ramsay was flown back to Australia and died in Bowral on the evening of May 1. He was single and had no children, and is survived by his brother Peter Oscar, twin sister Anne and brother-in-law Brian, as well as nieces and nephews. The company announced Mr Ramsay's stake in Ramsay health, worth $3.3 billion, will be left to his charitable foundation. Neither James nor Erica took communion during the service, remaining inseparable as the prime minister helped himself to the bread and wine. James Packer filed out behind the coffin, with his arm around his ex-wife's waist and appeared to shed tears as he exited the church. Press had gathered outside the church to catch sight of the celebrities inside, and a visibly frustrated James Packer told them: 'Guys it's somebody else's funeral, it's not cool.' When asked by media if he thought his fight with Mr Gyngell last week had overshadowed Paul Ramsay's funeral, he replied tersely: 'Excuse me? I'm here for Paul Ramsay who was a great man.' Erica Packer flew into Australia on Thursday morning  with her youngest child Emmanuelle, 20 months so she could attend the funeral of the billionaire. Erica is currently based in Los Angeles where she lives with the couple's three children. According to The Daily Telegraph, Mr Ramsay remained a firm supporter of Erica - who is also known by her maiden name Baxter - following her split from Packer in September. Ahead of the funeral, the former Mrs Packer decided to take the opportunity to visit some friends yesterday - most notably the wife of David Gyngell, Leila McKinnon. The pair met on Thursday afternoon, just days after the brawl between Mr Packer, 46, and Mr Gyngell, 47. The fight followed a heated text message exchange because Packer believed a camera crew from the network run by Gyngell was trying to catch him with rumoured lover, model Miranda Kerr. Gyngell had gone to the $20million property in Sydney's Bondi Beach to reassure casino owner he was not under surveillance by Nine Network television cameras. On Friday, the pair were given criminal infringement notices for offensive behaviour, a penalty which carries a fine of $500 if it goes uncontested by the recipient. The case stalled earlier in the week due to the fact neither Packer nor Gyngell lodged an official complaint over the incident. At the funeral, Mr Packer's left eye was still visibly puffy and bruised from the fight and in a further reminder of the public fight Alan Jones greeted Erica with a playful mock punch to the chin. Police have announced that both Mr Packer and Mr Gyngell will be fined $500 over the incident. Neither Mr Packer nor Mr Gyngell have lodged an official complaint over the incident, yet Mr Gyngell took responsibility for the fight in a statement. '[Mr Gyngell] fully accepts that he was the instigator of the incident. He respects the job police do and will co-operate fully with their investigation,' it said. The incident stemmed from an angry text message exchange between the two men, after Mr Packer thought a camera crew from the network was trying to film him with rumoured flame Miranda Kerr. Ms Kerr was at Sydney airport on Thursday morning at the same time as Ms Packer - while the casino boss's ex arrived, his speculated new love interest was said to be flying to Shanghai. The scuffle does not seem to have affected the relationship between Erica and Mr Gyngell's wife, Leila Mckinnon, whom the model visited on Thursday afternoon. The TV reporter and Ms Packer are close family friends. Mr Gyngell was best man at the Packers' wedding in 2007, and Mr Packer was best man at Mr Gyngell's wedding to Ms McKinnon in 2004. Ms McKinnon's eighteen-month-old son Ted was born just one month after Ms Packer's youngest daughter Emmanuelle. Ms Packer, who has three children with the billionaire casino mogul, looked calm and collected on Thursday when she was spotted meeting up with friends in Sydney. The 36-year-old jetted in from Los Angeles where she is now based, on Thursday morning carrying Emmanuelle as they made their way through the terminal.

"By . Meghan Keneally . Katie Couric has shot down reports that she will return to The Today Show when Savannah Guthrie goes on maternity leave. Couric's afternoon talk show has been cancelled and is wrapping up its final tapings next month as she heads to Yahoo to start her new role as the site's first global news anchor. Because of the break in her schedule, some unidentified sources said that she had been asked to return to her old early morning stomping grounds and fill in for Guthrie but she said Tuesday that she will never be returning. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Next gig: Katie Couric said that she does not plan to return to morning television and she's headed to Yahoo after her afternoon talk show finishes taping in June . 'I don’t think so. No, no, no,' she said when asked by CNN's Bill Weir if she ever thought of returning to morning television. 'Sometimes I miss the gang. 'I had a wonderful 15 year run at the Today show, and I’m still in touch with them. So, you know, they’ll always have a special place in my heart.' There was even speculation that should her temporary fill-in go well, she would be asked to stay on permanently. That wouldn't be the first time that such a move was pulled, however, since that is how Couric got the Today Show gig in the first place. Old and new: Couric and Savannah Guthrie, seen together over the weekend at the White House Correspondents Dinner, have both been Matt Lauer's co-hosts for the Today Show . Couric sat in for then-co-host Deborah Norville when Norville was on maternity leave and Couric was given the position full time when she didn't return. Given Couric's most recent denial, it doesn't look like the past will be repeating itself quite yet. NBC News head Deborah Turness also shot down the speculation of a Couric-Lauer reunion on Wednesday. 'Savannah has been such a big part of the ‘Today’ show’s momentum over the last few months,' she told The New York Times. 'While she’s with her newborn we’ll keep that momentum going with our own homegrown talent with perhaps a few surprises mixed in.'","Was speculation that Couric would return to her post at The Today Show when Savannah Guthrie takes her maternity leave in the late summer .

"By . Sarah Michael . James Packer and David Gyngell have been given criminal infringement notices for offensive behaviour following their very public brawl outside Packer's Bondi mansion on Sunday. The penalty carries a fine of $500 if it goes uncontested by the recipient. NSW Police released a statement on Friday afternoon stating: 'Officers from the Eastern Suburbs Local Area Command have been investigating the incident which occurred about 2pm on Sunday 4 May on Sir Thomas Mitchell Road near the intersection of Campbell Parade at Bondi. Black eye: James Packer, pictured with a visible bruise on his left eye as he attended a funeral in Bowral on Friday, has been charged with offensive behaviour following his punch-up with David Gyngell on Sunday . 'Police today issued a 46-year-old man and a 48-year-old man with a Criminal Infringement Notice for offensive behaviour.' A Nine spokesperson told the MailOnline: 'Mr Gyngell is pleased the process is now resolved.' The $500 fine is unlikely to be a problem for casino mogul Packer or Nine Entertainment CEO Gyngell, with Forbes estimating Packer's net worth to be $US6.3 billion ($A6.7 billion). In November last year Nine Entertainment's prospectus revealed Gyngell is the highest-paid media executive in Australia with a remuneration package worth about $10 million a year, The Australian Financial Review reported. The case surrounding the punch-up stalled earlier in the week due to the fact neither Packer, 46, nor Gyngell, 48, lodged an official complaint over the incident. United front: The billionaire casino mogul and his ex-wife Erica attended the funeral of mutual friend Paul Ramsay together, the first time they have been seen in public since their shock split last year . Acting assistant police commissioner Mark Walton held a press conference where he said police had contacted the men's legal representatives but neither man had been questioned over the incident and heavily watermarked images had made investigation difficult. 'We first became aware of it as it was released in the media,' he said. 'We did review our holdings to see if there was anything we missed. 'In the earlier material it was so difficult to see what was going on because of the branding of it, I certainly wasn’t expecting police to rush out there. 'As the material has become available and the police have started to form a view of what occurred, that is the appropriate time to hold our inquiries.' On Tuesday Gyngell took responsibility for the stoush, releasing a statement which said had he not turned up at Packer’s premises in an angry mood, then the confrontation would never have occurred. Penalty: Nine boss Gyngell, 48, (pictured on Monday) and Packer, 46, face $500 fines . '[Mr Gyngell] fully accepts that he was the instigator of the incident. He respects the job police do and will co-operate fully with their investigation,' the statement said. Packer and Gyngell, who are childhood friends and were best man at one another's wedding, came to blows in the street outside Packer's luxury beach side apartment on Sunday afternoon. The fight followed a heated text message exchange because Packer believed a camera crew from the network run by Gyngell was trying to catch him with rumoured lover, model Miranda Kerr. Gyngell had gone to the $20 million property in Sydney's Bondi Beach to reassure casino owner he was not under surveillance by Nine Network television cameras. The pair immediately became embroiled in a profanity-laced argument which descended into blows. Explosive pictures showed Packer in tracksuit pants and a bearded, bare-foot Gyngell pummeling each other repeatedly and wrestling on the ground before being pulled apart by a bodyguard. Reports of the scuffle say Gyngell, the smaller of the two men, appeared to connect with Packer's eye in a left hook. Following the fight, Packer was seen walking off with his left eye puffy and his grey tracksuit pants marked with grass stains.","Casino mogul and Nine CEO given criminal infringement notices .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Tori Spelling's tiny and diminishing frame has long been a source of speculation, and now her mother, Candy, has opened up about her own struggles with an eating disorder, in her explosive new memoir Candy At Last, according to RadarOnline. Although her daughter has publicly denied being anorexic in the past - despite jokingly referring to her 'keep your f***ing mouth shut' diet - Candy certainly seems to imply that deep rooted food issues run in the family. 'Once Tori was born, I got even thinner than I had been before I was pregnant,' she writes, detailing how she 'deprived' herself of food. '[My husband] Aaron always thought I looked terrific, but I still couldn’t see how I really looked.' Scroll down for video . Tell-all: Candy Spelling has confessed to having 'body images' issues and 'depriving herself of food and binging' in her explosive new memoir Candy At Last . In the newly released book, Candy confesses that she has 'body dysmorphic syndrome' - a mental disorder which makes it difficult for sufferers to see themselves as they really are. 'I perceived an imaginary defect in my body,' she reveals. 'This started in my teen years, when, like most other girls, I was very preoccupied with my appearance.' The 68-year-old matriarch, who has been in and out of bitter feuds with Tori for decades, said she went through cycles of starving herself and binging whenever things got tough in her life. Worryingly thin: Tori's (pictured in LA last month) shrinking frame has been closely scrutinized over the years, despite the star having denied she is anorexic in the past . The problem worsened, Candy says, when her husband, director Aaron Spelling, died from cancer in 2006. Instead of 'reading a lot of books' or 'taking up a new hobby', she fell back into her negative eating habits before finally deciding to see a psychologist. 'I realized I had body image issues and that I was eating to comfort myself,' she writes. 'My relationship with food and my ability to discuss my feelings are a work in progress.' More Spelling drama: Candy's comments could be read as implying that she has unwittingly passed her eating disorder onto her daughter Tori, as the condition is known to be hereditary . Tori, who has been struggling both with marriage problems and a recent agonizing spine condition, has seemingly been supportive of her mother's recovery. '[Tori] wrote me a beautiful letter in which she shared that it was painful for her to hear how critical I am of myself,' she says. 'Children have different eyes for their parents.' But unsurprisingly, it looks as though their strained mother-daughter relationship may be hitting the rocks once again in light of certain revelations which have surfaced in Candy's explosive memoir. Making it work? Candy says their family relationship is now a 'work in progress', pictured here together in 2010 . In it, she risks reigniting her long-running feud with her daughter by pleading to 'stop blaming your parents' and alleging that if she didn't buy Tori 'extravagant gifts' she would get cut off. 'I also believe that there comes a time when . you have to stop blaming your parents. Take responsibility for your own . actions and attitudes,' writes Candy. Tori wrote me a beautiful letter in which she shared that it was painful for her to hear how critical I am of myself . But she does admit to not always being the perfect mother. 'I . see now that in my quest to be the perfect mother and create the . picture-perfect life for my children, I was too focused on the bigger . picture and not enough on the smaller brush strokes. I feel badly that . my children felt I wasn’t affectionate enough. I thought I was,' she . goes on. The mother and daughter famously fell out before Tori's media mogul father Aaron Spelling's death in 2006. 'I was devastated about Tori and [Aaron] was angry,' she claims in the book. 'He left her numerous messages on her cell phone. I tried reaching her as well. Not surprisingly, we didn’t hear back from her,' she added. Around this time, Tori started dating and eventually married Dean McDermott. But with no communication between them, it wasn't until Aaron's funeral that Candy ever laid eyes on her new son-in-law. 'It was very emotional because I didn’t know if she was going to show up. This was my first time seeing my new son-in-law Dean. A friend of mine couldn’t bear the awkwardness. ""This isn’t right,"" he said.' United front: Candy didn't meet Tori's husband Dean until Aaron Spelling's funeral, the three of them pictured here in 2011 . Adding to the tension was the fact that Aaron reportedly left his daughter $800,000, a fraction of his $500m fortune. Candy - who is now worth a reported $600m - even goes on to say that Tori would cut her off if she wouldn't lavish the former Beverly Hills, 90210 star with expensive gifts. 'When I denied Tori an extravagant purchase, it resulted in radio silence,' she revealed. Tori has been open about her financial struggles and how difficult it is to support four children now that her acting career has slowed down. Family time: The matriarch said when Tori had her first child, they made amends, pictured here with her daughter and granddaughter Stella in 2011 . Although Candy claims their falling out was 'excruciating,' everything changed as soon as Tori gave birth to her first child Liam in 2007. 'We have never discussed that painful period in our lives when we didn’t speak,' said the 68-year-old. 'We just tried carefully to move past . it. I like to think that it was her pregnancy that paved the way for us . to resolve our issues.' Double standards: While on the Today show, Candy revealed that watching . True Tori is 'painful' - and in a letter she allegedly received from her daughter, Tori also said it was 'painful' so see her mother struggle . While they have their ups and downs, she now calls their mother-daughter relationship a 'work in progress' adding, 'We have a pattern, and until we can break it hand in hand, this is going to be the little dance she and I do together.' But she says she does 'worry' about her daughter, who suffers from migraines and 'has her hands full,' even with several nannies. During an appearance on the Today show on Monday, the author revealed that she is watching the Lifetime docu-series True Tori but that it isn't easy. 'As a mom, you don't want to see your children hurt in any way, and I have to say that it's painful for me to watch it,' she revealed.","Candy also reveals in her memoir Candy At Last that Tori wrote her a 'beautiful' letter about how 'painful' it is to see her mother, 68, struggle ."

The dogs do get a helping hand, so to speak, but that doesn't detract from the magical music being made. Scroll down for video .

Thumbs up for a job well done: The bluegrass tune rolls along thanks to the masterful pooches . The video is a creation of Cameron Owens, a musician from Johnson City Tennesee. Originally from Boone, North Carolina, Owens lists on his Facebook profile that he plays mandolin and sings in two bands - Sons of Bluegrass and The Honey Chasers. Given Owens's affinity for the mandolin, he's a good bet to be behind dog number one. The video's owner Cameron Owens plays and sings in two bluegrass outfits . Although there doesn't appear to be any overt competition between the dogs, the title of the video is 'Dogs play Dueling Banjos'. 'Mrs Molly strikes again with her loving husband, Smoke.'

But Erica Packer and radio shock jock Alan Jones appeared to be intent on sharing a joke with each other as they stood outside the church. At one point Jones, a controversial personality, put his fist to her face in what may have been a reference to her ex-husband James's fight with David Gyngell earlier in the week. Scroll down for video . Radio shock jock Alan Jones appeared to jokingly punch Erica Packer in the face, a possible reference to her ex husband James Packer's fight with David Gyngell . Erica looked to be laughing as Jones extended his arm towards her. The very public fight between billionaire James Packer and David Gyngell took place outside Packer's Bondi home last Sunday afternoon. On Friday, the pair were given criminal infringement notices for offensive behaviour, a penalty which carries a fine of $500 if it goes uncontested by the recipient. More... James and Erica’s Ex Factor: Packers can’t keep their hands off each other at friend’s funeral . Well they certainly can both afford it! James Packer and David Gyngell face $500 fines after they were charged with offensive behaviour following their public punch-up . The case stalled earlier in the week due to the fact neither Packer nor Gyngell lodged an official complaint over the incident. The fight followed a heated text message exchange because Packer believed a camera crew from the network run by Gyngell was trying to catch him with rumoured lover, model Miranda Kerr. The shock jock held his fist up to Erica Packers face after the funeral of a mutual friend . Gyngell had gone to the $20million property in Sydney's Bondi Beach to reassure casino owner he was not under surveillance by Nine Network television cameras. Controversial figure Alan Jones hosts a conservative radio program on Sydney's 2GB, and is certainly no stranger to the spotlight. In September 2012, the shock jock, who is in his 70s, made headlines when at a Sydney University Liberal Club dinner he said that former Prime Minister Julia Gillard's recently deceased father 'died of shame.' 'The old man recently died a few weeks ago of shame. To think that he had a daughter who told lies every time she stood for parliament.' A jacket made of chaff bags and signed by Jones was also auctioned on the night, because Jones had previously said Ms Gillard should be put in a chaff bag and thrown out to sea. Jones is known for his controversial and staunchly conservative views, and all adverstising was suspended on his radio show after the supposedly private speech sparked vicious backlash from the public.

Nightclub baron Justin Hemmes was also spotted outside the church with his German Shepherd. Prime Minister Tony Abbott also attended the funeral at the Bowral church.

Millionaire hotelier, Justin Hemmes, who is CEO of the Merivale chain attended the funeral with his girlfriend Carla McKinnon and his German Shepherd . Paul Ramsay, 78, was the founder and chairman of Ramsay Health Care, a private hospital operator. Ramsay Healthcare, which Mr Ramsay founded in 1964, now has more than 150 hospitals in Australia, the UK, Indonesia, Malaysia and France. Hey was valued at $3.7 billion by Forbes in March. In 1983, Mr Ramsay bought a stake in Prime Media, the rural arm of Channel Seven. He was an ardent support of the Liberal Party and of former prime minster John Howard. Mr Ramsay was the party's most significant donor in 2011-2012, giving $605,000 one year. It was announced on April 24 that he was admitted to hospital in a serious condition, it was believed that he suffered a heart attack in Spain while sailing. Mr Ramsay was flown back to Australia and died in Bowral on the evening of May 1. He was single and had no children, and is survived by his brother Peter Oscar, twin sister Anne and brother-in-law Brian, as well as nieces and nephews. The company announced Mr Ramsay's stake in Ramsay health, worth $3.3 billion, will be left to his charitable foundation. Erica flew home from LA to Sydney on Thursday morning so she could attend the funeral of the billionaire with her youngest child Emmanuelle, 20 months. According to The Daily Telegraph, Mr Ramsay remained a firm supporter of Erica - who is also known by her maiden name Baxter - following her split from Packer in September. Ahead of the funeral, the former Mrs Packer decided to take the opportunity to visit some friends yesterday - most notably the wife of David Gyngell, Leila McKinnon. The pair met on Thursday afternoon, just days after the brawl between Mr Packer, 46, and Mr Gyngell, 47, which occurred outside Mr Packer's Bondi mansion. At the funeral, Mr Packer's left eye was still visibly puffy and bruised from the fight. Police have announced that they will be unlikely to investigate the incident any further. Neither Mr Packer nor Mr Gyngell have lodged an official complaint over the incident, yet Mr Gyngell took responsibility for the fight in a statement. '[Mr Gyngell] fully accepts that he was the instigator of the incident. He respects the job police do and will co-operate fully with their investigation,' it said. The incident stemmed from an angry text message exchange between the two men, after Mr Packer thought a camera crew from the network was trying to film him with rumoured flame Miranda Kerr. Ms Kerr was at Sydney airport this morning at the same time as Ms Packer - while the casino boss's ex arrived, his speculated new love interest was said to be flying to Shanghai. The scuffle does not seem to have affected the relationship between Erica and Mr Gyngell's wife, Leila Mckinnon, whom the model visited on Thursday afternoon. The TV reporter and Ms Packer are close family friends. Mr Gyngell was best man at the Packers' wedding in 2007, and Mr Packer was best man at Mr Gyngell's wedding to Ms McKinnon in 2004. Ms McKinnon's eighteen-month-old son Ted was born just one month after Ms Packer's youngest daughter Emmanuelle. Ms Packer, who has three children with the billionaire casino mogul, looked calm and collected on Thursday when she was spotted meeting up with friends in Sydney. The 36-year-old jetted in from Los Angeles where she is now based, on Thursday morning carrying Emmanuelle as they made their way through the terminal.

Riann Manser and his girlfriend, Vasti Geldenhuys, reached Miami Wednesday in their small, but high-tech rowboat, bringing an end to a trip that began in late December in Morocco. Manser told CBS News that he and Geldenhous collectively took about a million strokes to make the journey across the Atlantic Ocean. And the voyage wasn't always smooth, as in February, the boat capsized, trapping Geldenhuys underneath it for a short time.

The 105-day, 5,000-mile journey started on Dec. 30, 2013 in Morocco and ended Wednesday in Miami . 'You have to be willing to give everything, and that even includes your life,' Manser said. 'After the first day of rowing, I collapsed in that cabin, and I thought, I can't do this. This is too tough,' Geldenhuys said. As to why the couple made the arduous journey, they say it was a desire to visit New York City. And after a few days of rest in Miami, they will set off again for the Big Apple before returning to South Africa. The couple set sail on Dec. 30, 2013 from Agadir, Morocco aboard the 'Spirit of Madiba,' a 23-foot-long boat named after the late former South African President Nelson Mandela.

After that, it was two and half months of open water until they reached the Bahamas. 'You get this quiet time, and the sun is setting, and there's like pink and blue and white fluffy clouds, and it's just so quiet,' Geldenhuys said. Just before the couple reached Miami, they embraced with a hug and a kiss. 'If Vasti wasn't with me, I wouldn't have been able to have this moment,' Manser said. And the couple said they are looking forward to their first regular meal in more than 100 days. 'A big hamburger with bacon, cheese and anything else that can go on it and a beer and Coke Zero,' Geldenhuys said.","Riann Manser and Vasti Geldenhuys, both of South Africa, set sail from Morocco at the end of December and arrived in Miami on Wednesday .

"By . Chris Paine . One cheeky Los Angeles band has pulled the wool over Spotify's eyes with a cheeky if not brilliant stunt that netted them $20,000 for uploading nothing but dead air to the popular streaming service. The indie outfit Vulfpeck managed to raise some much-needed recording funds without so much as producing a single genuine second of music after figuring out a way to game Spotify. Vulfpeck uploaded an 'album' called Sleepify - 10 silent tracks that all run just over 30 seconds, the required threshold from Spotify to classify something as a song. And here's where the money comes in: for every song streamed by a user on Spotify, the artist earns 0.007 cents. Hoorah! Vulpeck managed to score $20,000 from Spotify in silent streams . The band explains the maths behind the stunt, which nets $0.007 in royalties for each stream . Spotify eventually shut down the band's prank but laughed it off saying: 'We prefer Vulfpeck's earlier albums' Apparently Vulfpeck have some loyal fans, because they 'listened' to Sleepify by the thousands and followed the ban's instructions to stream it - on repeat - while they slept. Fans were even promised free tickets to 'The Sleepify Tour'. Cheeky, indeed - but the so-called album brought in $20,000. Until Spotify clued in. Vulfpeck were forced to pull the album, obviously, and Spotify seemed to take the incident in fairly good spirits. 'It's a clever stunt but we prefer Vulfpeck's earlier albums,' Spotify spokesman Graham James told Billboard. According to Vice the band hasn't been paid yet but they're optimistic because Spotify's payments usually come through after two months. Vulfpeck bandmember Jack Stratton said: 'My guess is we will.' There's a tour? The band promised fans a free ticket to their tour if they participated in the stunt . Considering they're $20,000 better off for doing nothing, you'd think they'd look a little happier . In the meantime they may have stumbled upon another brilliant idea. Vulfpeck have issued an 'apology' album entitled Official Statements, CNN reports. The track lengths? Just over 30 seconds. 'The gist of it was that, while they enjoyed Sleepify and thought it was funny and clever, that it violated their terms of content,' Stratton says on the first track. 'So I don't know what's going to happen with it - it's very uncertain at the moment. 'And in light of that uncertainly I want to take 30 seconds silence to ponder the uncertainty.'","Vulfpeck released silent album 'Sleepify' and earned $0.007 per stream .

"By . Ted Thornhill . The man who has officially become the oldest in the world admits that he has no idea how it’s happened. Alexander Imich, from New York’s Upper West Side, has reached the grand old age of 111. The supercentenarian (someone older than 110) became the oldest man in the world when Arturo Licata of Italy died on April 24, just one week before his 112th birthday. Scroll down for video . Golden oldie: Alexander Imich, from New York¿s Upper West Side, has reached 111 years of age . He told NBC 4, however, that he’s not entirely sure how he’s managed to stay alive for quite so long. He said: ‘I have no idea how this happened.’ Mr Imich was born on February 4, 1903 – the year the first Teddy Bear went on sale in America and the Wright brothers took to the skies in the first aeroplane. He was born in Poland and eventually became a chemistry professor. He emigrated to the U.S in 1951 with his wife, Wela, settling at first in Waterbury, Connecticut. He moved to New York when she passed away in 1986. Mr Imich thinks his longevity can be partly explained by his sensible diet – he has never drunk alcohol and has always eaten chicken and fish regularly. He also maintained an active lifestyle when he was younger, being a keen gymnast and swimmer. He added that a lack of children may have helped, too. There are currently 66 women older than Mr Imich, according to the Gerontology Research Group in California.

"By . Ted Thornhill . Smog and air pollution are lingering environmental problems in China. But a city in the northwestern region is determined to fight against dirty air using nothing more complicated than plain old tap water. Recently, local residents in Lanzhou, capital of northwest Chinas Gansu province, found that two giant sprayers had been set up at the Dongfanghong Square where a subway station of the city's Metro Line 1 is under construction. Will they see clearly now? The water sprayers will throw pulverized water 2,000 feet into the air to dispel pollution . Grand cannon: The sprayers have been placed next to construction works for a new subway station . Size matters: The cannons are enormous and have been getting a lot of attention from passers-by . The two long-range sprayers are able to pulverize and spurt out tap water to wipe out dust and smog within a radius of 600 meters to reduce air pollution caused by the metro construction. Martyn Chipperfield, Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry at the University of Leeds, said the water will cling on to the pollutants and bring them back down to earth. He told MailOnline: 'Lanzhou has a big problem with smog, like lots of Chinese cities. This is a small-scale effort to damp down the dust. The water will go up as a fine mist, and stick to the dust and form larger particles - and fall back down to the surface under gravity. It's basically replicating rain on a local level.' This does of course mean that anyone in the vicinity is likely to get quite mucky. However, Professor Chipperfield said that 'it will stop dust spreading over a wider area'. It won't stop pollution elsewhere, though, he added. Earlier this year Chinese scientists said that pollution 900 miles away in Beijing was so dense that its effects were comparable to that of a nuclear winter. It has been predicted that if enough nuclear bombs were detonated, so many particles would be thrown into the air that the sun could be blocked out enough to alter the weather and damage the food supply. Issue: Pollution is a major problem in many Chinese cities . Calamity: Earlier this year the pollution in Beijing was said by one expert to be having a similar effect to that of a nuclear winter . This process was under way in China’s capital city and six northern provinces, according to He Dongxian from China Agricultural University’s College of Water Resources and Civil Engineering.She warned that the toxic smog was hindering photosynthesis of plants and that if it lingers much longer, it could affect food production, according to The Guardian. Pollution had been so severe that aircraft were grounded, roads closed and tourists numbers hit, while the direct danger posed to human health was underlined by the World Health Organisation, whose readings in Beijing in February had alarming results. It was reported that the level of PM 2.5 particles, a key measure of pollution because they are small enough to be assimilated into the blood stream, reached 505 micrograms per cubic metre, far higher than the maximum level it considers to be safe, which is 25. Authorities have introduced anti-pollution policies and often pledged to clean up the environment but the problem has not eased. It remains to be seen whether the water sprayers can form part of a long-term solution.","Two giant sprayers have been set up in Lanzhou, in China's Gansu province .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . George Osborne was turned away from a town centre cafe - because the owner was too busy with the lunchtime rush. Amanda Biggs was approached by the Chancellor’s aides the day before he made a whistle stop tour of Bolton yesterday. But she said it wouldn’t have been fair to her regulars at the Thyme Deli and Cafe in Horwich, Bolton. Amanda Biggs, the owner of Thyme Deli in Horwich, Bolton, turned away George Osborne because she was too busy with the lunchtime rush . Ms Biggs said: 'They initially just told me it was a senior figure but didn’t tell me it was George Osborne, even if they had it wouldn’t have made any difference. 'I had to tell them no because they wanted to reserve seating for 10 people at our busiest time. 'As a local business I didn’t want to tell my regular customers that they couldn’t come in because that wouldn’t be fair and wouldn’t be good for business.' She stressed her decision had 'absolutely nothing to do with politics'. Ms Biggs added: 'This was purely a . business decision, If Mr Osborne had wanted to come and speak to me . about my shop at a later time then that would have been fine - this . wasn’t politically motivated and it certainly wasn’t a PR stunt for the . shop. 'This is the same decision I would make every time.' Amanda Biggs said it would not have been fair to her regulars to give up one of her tables for the Chancellor . Mr . Osborne visited businesses in the town's Winter Hey Lane to find out . how the economy was coping and to campaign for Chris Green, the Tory . candidate for Bolton West at next year’s general election. An aide to the Chancellor insisted he was not offended. He said: 'We totally understand that because they are so busy at lunchtime they couldn't take a reservation for a meeting with local businesses. 'Next time George is in Bolton he will definitely try it out. He is on the side of all hardworking people who are running their own business.' Despite not being able to stop for a coffee the Tatton MP and his group called into Cafe Latte and Home Bakery. Diane Farrimond, aged 50, who works in the shop, said: 'We didn’t actually get to sit down with him because we were so busy running around serving people. 'I do think it is good that these politicians are visiting us. They should do it more but if I’m honest I don’t think his government are helping us.' Mr Osborne also called into J.Greeley Butchers. Owner Duncan Greeley said: 'I wasn’t star struck or anything, the Chancellor is just a title - it makes no difference to me. 'Things are very tough for businesses like mine at the moment.' Mr Osborne's cafe snub came after the Prime Minister visited a branch of Nandos in Bristol for a meal. David Cameron did not face the same difficulty being allowed into Nandos in Bristol as the Chancellor faced getting a cup of tea in Bolton . David Cameron visited the fast food chain - famous for its spicy peri-peri chicken and chips - with aides last night. A Downing Street spokeswoman said Mr Cameron ate chicken and coleslaw at Nando's. Asked whether he checked if the meal he was ordering was halal, following days of controversy over restaurants' use of meat slaughtered according to the traditional Muslim ritual, the spokeswoman said: 'The Prime Minister is comfortable with the meat he eats and buys.' She added: 'I don't think it's unusual for someone at the end of the working day to want to go and have a meal.'","Osborne wanted to stop for a cup of tea after visit to Lancashire town .

"By . Becky Barrow, Business Correspondent . The taxman is demanding powers to seize money  from couples’ joint bank accounts – even if one partner owes nothing. HM Revenue and Customs wants to be able to take money from any account – including Isas and joint accounts –  if it believes someone owes taxes. MPs will today launch a withering attack on the controversial proposal, which they say could cause ‘serious detriment’ to  ordinary taxpayers. Under new powers being requested by HM Revenue and Customs, the taxman would be able to seize cash from from joint accounts and Isas if they believed one of the account holders owed money . The Treasury select committee warns: ‘This policy is highly dependent on HMRC’s ability to accurately determine which taxpayers owe money and what amounts they owe – an ability not always demonstrated in the past. Incorrectly collecting money will result in serious detriment to taxpayers.’ Under the proposal, HMRC will be able  to take all the money a person owes out of their bank account, building society account or Isa ‘without the need to apply to a court’. HMRC insists it will not take the money unless the person has at least £5,000 left across all their bank accounts, including Isas, after the debt has been paid. It will not ‘create or increase overdrafts’. Anybody who owes more than £1,000  could be affected and HMRC expects to seize £375 million over the next four years. But experts warn that many couples are secretive about their finances, do not know what each other earns, and never discuss their finances or whether or not they have paid their tax bills. Robin Williamson, of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, said: ‘The problem is HMRC’s “shoot first, ask questions later” approach.’ Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, added: ‘Clearly, it needs a safeguard because otherwise it will hit people who have no idea that their husband or wife is a complete rogue.’ Anyone who owes more than £1,000 could be affected as HMRC expects to seize £375¿million in four years . Innocent victims of the policy could include pensioners who put money into a joint account, managed by younger relatives. If their younger relative owes taxes, the money could be seized, even though it belongs to the elderly person. When the plans to raid accounts were published in the Budget, there was no mention of joint accounts. The proposal was first mooted in an HMRC consultation  document released this week. Anthony Thomas, of the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, said the proposals – subject to a consultation which ends on July 29 – posed ‘far too great a risk’ to ordinary Britons. He said: ‘If strictly observed, the safeguards and conditions as set out should be broadly effective but if they are disregarded, vulnerable taxpayers will suffer – and that is far too great a risk.’ The consultation document said HMRC expects 17,000 people a year will be hit by the new rules, known as the ‘direct recovery of debts’. Typically, they will owe an average of £5,800 in tax. The document acknowledges the importance of ‘striking a balance between recovering money from debtors while protecting the rights of other account holders’. According to HMRC (pictured) Britain is being robbed of £35billion a year by cheats not paying what they owe . But it said its new powers must include joint accounts, or it would ‘provide an obvious opportunity for debtors to circumvent paying what they owe’. It suggests a ‘pro-rata’ system, whereby HMRC could deduct 50 per cent of the credit balance of a joint account to pay a tax debt. But Mr Williamson said it was wrong to withdraw 50 per cent of the money from a joint account because many couples did not contribute money to a joint account on an equal basis. He added: ‘For example, a woman might be putting in all the money while her husband is pursuing an unsuccessful business venture and has run up a tax debt.’ David Gauke, exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘It will help to level the playing field between those who pay  what they owe when they owe it, and those who do not.’ Britain is being robbed of £35 billion a year by cheats who don’t pay their taxes and others who find ways of avoiding  paying them, according to HMRC. A spokesman said: ‘We will be including joint accounts. If we didn’t, there would be an opportunity for debtors to get out of paying what they owe.’","Taxman is asking for new powers to seize money from any bank account .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Council officers in Scotland are turning up the heat on night-time dog walkers who let their pets poop in public spaces – by tracking culprits using thermal imaging equipment. The advanced technology – which is usually used to catch criminals and dangerous drivers - is being deployed by Fife Council because the problem of dog mess in Fife has become a major problem. The thermal cameras will be able to detect the body heat of dogs and their owners - and recently produced poo - from hundreds of yards away. Ruff justice: Fife Council wardens and officials with their infra-red equipped anti-dog poop van . The council officers who will be tasked with handing out fines will also be given stab vests to protect themselves from any violent or aggressive dog owners. A street cleaning survey in the region showed that 88 per cent of respondents rated fouling as a problem in their area, higher than any other street cleaning issue. The council’s environmental enforcement wardens can hand out fixed penalty fines for dog fouling, litter dropping, abandoned vehicles and fly tipping. Messy mutts: A street cleaning survey in the Fife region showed that 88 per cent of respondents rated fouling as a problem in their area . Thermal-imaging cameras see light on the infrared spectrum, which the human eye cannot pick up. The hotter an object, the more infrared radiation is emitted. Hot objects glow brightly when seen through an infrared filter. It is customary to mark out hot objects with a white colour and cold objects in black. Temperatures in between are coloured red and yellow. Infrared radiation was discovered by British astronomer Sir Frederick William Herschel in 1800. However, officers said that not all culprits take kindly to the serving of such notices. Jim Beveridge, an environment enforcer at Fife Council, said: ‘It could get dangerous when issuing a fine. ‘People don’t like to be charged, so we always wear stab-proof vests because you never know what people are carrying these days. ‘There is no excuse for people turning away, ignoring and failing to pick up their dog’s mess, even if they take one step away from the dog-fouling I would be tempted to fine them because they have no intention of picking it up.’ A Fife Council spokesman said: ‘Staff are expected to wear their vests when on patrol or issuing a fixed penalty notice.’ Meanwhile, community safety operations manager, Mark McCall said that the use of infra-red technology ultimately leads to improved quality of life for Fifers. He said: ‘The CCTV vehicle we are using for this is owned by Fife Community Safety Partnership. ‘It is used by partners for a range of projects that aim to make our communities safer and more pleasant places for residents to live. ‘The vehicle is used for other activities such as monitoring traffic calming measures, littering, at football matches or other big events and in town centres at night to monitor street disorders.’","Fife Council is using thermal tech to catch misbehaving dog owners .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Dreams of stardom: Simone Reed, who stripped to her underwear in the middle of a Jobcentre in a Neknomination dare, has now auditioned for X Factor . A young mother who stripped to her underwear in the middle of a Jobcentre in a Neknomination dare has set her sights on more than just internet notoriety by auditioning for X Factor. Simone Reed made headlines at the height of the Neknomination craze after she walked into a branch of Jobcentre Plus and shed her coat to reveal her bra, knickers and stockings. The mother-of-two said that despite having initial regrets about the dare in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, she is now embracing the exposure it gave her as she bids for X Factor fame. Ms Reed, 25, says she has already made . it through the first auditions for the ITV talent search and is now waiting . to hear if she has made it onto the live shows. It would be a far cry from her online strip show, which she said she had immediately regretted. 'The minute I did it I regretted it straight away. I didn’t even put it on the internet.' The film footage, posted on Facebook, . showed her disrobing while claiming she is protesting against sanctions to . her jobseeker's allowance. In the clip she is quickly thrown out of the job centre by a security officer, who . can be heard telling her to 'grow up' as she is thrown out, just before . her coat is thrown out as well. She was then seen outside the office, drinking from a can and nominating someone else to do the challenge. Ms Reed said the clip had been posted online by a friend. 'It was just a bit of a laugh,' she said. 'I am game to do a bit of everything. It went viral and global, in every newspaper across the world. It even reached China.' She now says that stripping off for the camera has provided her with something of an un-dress rehearsal for a life in the spotlight. 'I don’t regret it now. I am glad I done it.' Ms Reed says it has led to her doing 'topless glamour' for the Daily Sport newspaper and auditioning for X Factor. But she said she had been 'terrified' during her first audition for the hit television show's 11th series, which is set to welcome back judges Simon Cowell and Cheryl Cole. 'I sang a song called The Power of Love by Celine Dion,' she said. 'I was really nervous. I crumbled. I didn’t even hit the note properly.' Scroll down for video .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Ed Miliband faced fresh mockery today after a second Labour attack advert in a week backfired. The party released a poster accusing David Cameron and Nick Clegg of being 'two peas in a pod' and putting £450 on a family's food bill. It said George Osborne's 2010 VAT hike to 20 per cent had caused the price of the weekly shop to rocket. But the poster featured a host of everyday items that carry no VAT at all - because they are deemed essential by the Government. Labour's new attack on the Coalition accused Nick Clegg and David Cameron of acting together to hike the cost of the weekly shop. But most of a family's everyday food bill is VAT free . The botched attack ad came just days after the party was accused of resorting to a 'crass' class war after releasing a party political broadcast featuring Nick Clegg as the 'Un-credible shrinking man'. Today's poster shows the Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader surrounded by images of everyday goods, including fruit and vegetables, soft drinks, ketchup and biscuits. But most food and drink carries no VAT - although duty is charged on specific products such as alcohol, crisps and savoury snacks, and confectionery. However, even the chocolate chip cookies used in Labour's poster campaign appear to be VAT-free. According to Treasury rules, 'biscuits covered or partly covered in chocolate or some other products similar in taste and appearance to chocolate are standard-rated' at 20 per cent. But 'chocolate chip biscuits where the chips are either included in the dough or pressed into the surface before baking' are VAT free. Only when biscuits are 'wholly or partly coated' in chocolate do they carry VAT, according to HMRC's bizarre rules. However, they are at pains to point out that the classic 'bourbon' biscuit 'and other biscuits where the chocolate or similar product forms a sandwich layer between two biscuit halves'  are not taxed at all. 'Jaffa cakes and biscuits coated with caramel' are also VAT free. Tory MP Henry Smith accused Labour of not knowing what they were talking about. He said: 'It's the same old economic incompetence from Labour. They have no long-term plan to fix the economy so instead Ed Miliband resorts to political gimmicks that don't even add up.' A spoof of the Labour ad was almost immediately created online, replacing Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg with Labour's leading figures Mr Miliband and Ed Balls. The impromptu rebuttal says: 'Miliband and Balls, two Eds with no idea.' The Tories immediately flipped the Labour attack back on Ed Miliband - accusing him of being so 'out of touch' he did not know food was VAT-free . But a Labour Party spokesman said: 'David Cameron and Nick Clegg are desperately trying to deflect from the truth of their VAT bombshell. 'Their decision to increase VAT has added £450 to family bills over the year, on the Treasury's own figures. 'Families are paying more on their typical weekly shop as a result of the Tories and the Lib Dems and this poster rightly holds them to account. 'It is not an itemised list of everything they have increased VAT on - it is a representation of an average shopping basket.' Earlier this week Mr Miliband faced criticism from members of his own party over its 'un-credible shrinking man' political broadcast. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband has been accused of resorting to 'crass' class warfare in Labour's new advert for the European elections which features a shrinking Nick Clegg character (pictured) The US-style attack advert is based on the 1950s film The Incredible Shrinking Man and seeks to portray Tories (character on right) as out-of-touch toff who bully Nick Clegg (left) The film, titled shows an actor playing Mr Clegg shrinking in size as he . ditches policies such as opposition to university tuition fees. By the end of the film – a parody of the US 1957 movie The Incredible Shrinking Man – he is a tiny doll-like figure. The ad is thought to be the first product of Labour's new collaboration with American election guru David Axelrod . One Tory ‘minister’ suggests he should be hunted, before an actor playing the PM sets the Downing Street cat on him. The US-style attack ad is thought to be the first product of Labour’s relationship with American elections guru David Axelrod. A Labour source said: ‘It was aimed at younger people who don’t usually engage with politics and we think it has been effective.’ Party election campaign co-ordinator Douglas Alexander said the film was ‘a bit of fun’ but made a ‘serious point’. But critics in the party say its relentlessly negative message suggested a lack of ambition. Some MPs said it recalled the 2008 Crewe and Nantwich by-election when an attempt to paint Tory candidate Edward Timpson as a toff backfired and led to a humiliating defeat. One former minister described the film as ‘crass’. He added: ‘We tried waging class war in Crewe. It failed then and it will fail now. 'The trouble is the kids in the leader’s team are probably too young to remember that.’ Another Labour MP said the broadcast was ‘depressing’, adding: ‘Where was the positive vision to attract swing voters?’ Mark Ferguson, editor of the influential grassroots website LabourList, said the film lacked a ‘positive agenda’. Left-wing Guardian columnist Owen Jones said it was ‘a classic example of politics with the hope stripped away’. The advert takes place around the Cabinet table as 'posh' Tories lead by an actor playing David Cameron force Nick Clegg to backtrack on policies such as tuition fees . As Clegg abandons each of the policies he shrinks into his suit. However Labour critics say the ad doesn't mention Europe or their party . Mr Clegg tried to laugh off the film’s efforts to ridicule him. He said: ‘They spent money on this? Particularly from Ed Miliband who is the sort of missing man in British politics. ‘He hasn’t breathed a word about the issue we’re supposed to be debating, which is whether we’re in or out of Europe.’","New poster accuses Cameron and Clegg of being 'two peas in a pod'

"By . Harriet Arkell . The president of the Oxford Union who is accused of raping a fellow student will not be continuing with his duties, students were told last night. Ben Sullivan, 21, who was arrested and questioned by police over two alleged offences before being released on bail, has not formally resigned his position. But at last night's Oxford Union debate, undergraduate Mayank Banerjee, 21, told students that he would take on the day-to-day running of the union. Gone: Ben Sullivan, 21, who was arrested on suspicion of rape, is no longer acting as Oxford Union president . Arrested: The former public schoolboy is a third year history and politics student at Christ Church college . Oxford University: Sullivan, who is on bail, was said to be in his room at Christ Church, pictured, last night . Students who attended the debate on Scottish independence said Mr Banerjee told the 80-strong audience he was now Acting President, and added: 'Obviously he [Sullivan] is innocent until proven guilty.' There was no sign of Sullivan, a third year History and Politics student whose finals exams start next month, at the Union debate, but friends said he was in his room at Christ Church College. The privately-educated undergraduate, from Kensington, west London, was arrested by Thames Valley Police shortly after 7am on Wednesday. He was questioned for several hours on suspicion of rape and an attempted rape, both of which are alleged to have taken place in January and April last year. Both alleged victims are said to be female students at the university.  Sullivan was later bailed without charge until 18 June. Mr Banerjee, a second-year undergraduate studying politics, philosophy and economics (PPE) at St John’s College, was due to take over as president next term, but has stepped up early. Quizzed: The president of the Oxford Union, pictured with his arm around a friend, has been bailed until 18 June . The banker's son from Kensington was questioned over alleged attacks on two female students at Oxford . Sullivan, a former pupil at £22,000-a-year St Paul's School in west London, was elected unopposed to the illustrious post of president of the Oxford Union last year. The debating society has been a breeding ground for future prime ministers and politicians since it was founded in 1823, with William Gladstone, Herbert Asquith and Edward Heath among its alumni. More recently, it has been a stepping stone to success for Foreign Secretary, William Hague, Education Secretary, Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London.

"By . Richard Spillett . It looks more like something from a high-tech electronics factory than a hospital - but this £2million 'robot surgeon' is now saving the lives of cancer patients in Britain. The so-called Da Vinci robot is an extremely precise surgical tool which is being used to perform operations in a hospital in Newcastle. The four-armed machine is operated by a surgeon in a special booth in the Freeman hospital's operating theatre and allows them to work with greater precision. Scroll down for video . The £2million Da Vinci robot allows surgeons to carry out precise operations on patients with lung, throat, bladder and other cancers . The four-armed machine is operated by a specialist in a 'booth', who is given a 3D view of the patient's internal organs . It has so far been used to remove cancerous tissue from patients' lungs, throats, prostates and spleens and has assisted medical teams performing heart bypass operations. The robot's arms go inside the patient during operations, while a surgeon uses a 3D viewfinder, which magnifies the patient's internal organs. Naeem Soomro, consultant urologist and associate medical director at the Freeman Hospital, told Newcastle's Evening Chronicle: 'We can now get into areas which were previously inaccessible to the human hand.' He added: 'It gets into the mouth, the tongue, the rib cage, where previously a surgeon simply could not move to work.' Paul Renforth, Da Vinci co-ordinator at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital, says the machine is allowing surgeons to go 'to places we couldn't get to before' Unlike human surgeons, the robot doesn't get tired and so can perform up to 400 operations a year . The robot's tools are used for up to 10 operations before they are replaced and the robot can carry out up to 400 procedures every year. Experts say the machines reduce the risk of complications during and after surgery. Paul Renforth, Da Vinci co-ordinator at the Freeman, told the Guardian: 'You can rotate the instruments 360 degress, so they are more dextrous than the human hand.' The robots in Newcastle are among 42 around the UK and it is thought the machines' use could spread in the future.","Robot allows surgeons to perform precise operations on cancer patients .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A retired policeman had to tell nurses that his mother had died after finding her 'propped up' and 'cold' during a visit to the hospital, an inquest has heard. Joan James, 85, from Solihull, Birmingham, was found dead by Martyn James, 54, on January 22 last year, 30 minutes after she had last been checked by a nurse. Nurses at Heartlands in Birmingham had no idea Mrs James had died . until her son - who had unknowingly been downstairs getting a coffee - raised the alarm, the widow's inquest was told. Martyn James, 54, says he found his mother Joan, 85, dead in her hospital bed in Heartlands, Birmingham, 30 minutes after she had last been checked by a nurse . Widow Mrs James died on January 22 last year after staff told the family she was 'acutely ill'. She is pictured earlier in her stay at the hospital. At the inquest at the Solihull Council House, Mr James, who is also from Solihull, described how he had been downstairs with his family before returning to his mother's bedside, around 2pm. Mrs James - who had been last checked by nurses at 1.30pm - was sat up in her bed but was not moving, the inquest heard. He said: 'I approached her bed and noticed she was slightly propped up. I said 'Mum' four or five times but she didn't move. 'We approached the bed and she wasn't moving. I touched her forehead and it was slightly cold. 'I knew she had passed away. I was with my family and we all became extremely upset.' Mr James said he was 'extremely upset' after finding his mother . Mr James had been with his two sons, aged 21 and 19, his daughter, aged 16 and his brother Brian when he found his mother. Speaking after the inquest, Mr James said: 'What angers us most is that we were downstairs having a coffee while our mother was dying. 'We were not there when she needed us the most. We are still finding it all very hard to come to terms with. 'We were a close family but there are always things you wish you had said and now we will never get the chance.' The inquest heard that Mrs James, who died from bronchial pneumonia, had been admitted to hospital on New Year's Eve 2012 for a fractured hip and shoulder after a fall at home. Before her death, medical staff believed Mrs James was well enough to move to a care centre. But, when they tried to move her, she was immediately sent back to A&E with low oxygen levels, the inquest heard. Mr James told the coroner he was therefore shocked when doctors had not told him earlier this his mother was 'acutely ill'. He told the inquest: 'We were never told of my mother's other health problems. When the doctor started to talk to me about the possibility of resuscitation, I was in shock. Heartlands in Birmingham said it could not comment on the case for 'legal and confidentiality reasons' 'As a family, we believe my mother should never have been discharged.' A Heartlands spokesman said the hospital had investigated the care given to Mrs James but she could not discuss the findings. She said: 'We are very sorry for the loss experienced by the family of Mrs James and the issues raised with her care while at our hospital. 'We agree with the findings of the coroner's court and a full investigation has been carried out and shared in full with the family. 'For legal and confidentiality reasons, we are unable to comment further at this stage.' Coroner Zafar Siddique recorded a verdict of death by natural causes. Joan James (right), with her granddaughter, was found dead in her hospital bed by her son Martyn. Birmingham Heartlands Hospital said it had investigated her care but did not make the findings public.

"By . Harry Mount . Sir George Christie took a massive gamble when he decided knock down his father's opera house and build a state-of-the-art facility . You may think that going to the opera at Glyndebourne is a relic from the days of Downton Abbey — an activity restricted to crumbling dukes in dinner jackets getting stuck into the champagne in between arias. It’s true that it’s expensive — £110 for the cheaper tickets to one of Mozart’s greatest operas, Don Giovanni, being performed this summer. But you could pay the same to watch a Premier League game or see the Rolling Stones in concert. So you have to view the cost in context. For the price of a ticket, you get the best music in the world, in one of the world’s greatest opera houses, and all in a beautifully unspoilt fold of the South Downs. And the black tie is optional. The unique feel of Glyndebourne is largely thanks to Sir George Christie, the man who took his father’s charming little theatre and turned it into an international opera house — and a fixture of the English summer season. On paper Sir George, who died earlier this week at 79, looked pretty unremarkable. Educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, he inherited the manor house at Glyndebourne from his father, John Christie. John was a World War I veteran, a former master at Eton and a Companion of Honour like his son — an unprecedented double. The house, a charming mishmash of Tudor, 17th century, Victorian and early 20th century styles, has been in the family since the early 17th century. The Christies can trace their lineage right back to Lady Godiva, the scantily dressed Anglo-Saxon noblewoman. But in truth, Sir George was far from unremarkable. When you met him, the first thing that struck you was his size — only 5ft   2ins. His character, too — jolly, friendly, anarchic — was far removed from the stuffy clichés that cling to the opera world. He shared the family passion for pugs — he was even said to have been named after a favourite family pet — and the artists’ pub at Glyndebourne is called the Pug and Whistle. When I met him a decade ago, at a summer party by the sea in Sandwich, he was wearing a sailor’s hat at a jaunty angle, a bright-pink shirt and a smile as broad as the English Channel. But where he displayed the greatest radicalism was in the revolution he plotted for the family opera house. Like a lot of seemingly ancient British traditions, Glyndebourne opera isn’t really that old. John Christie came up with the idea in 1934 (one of many sadnesses of Sir George’s death is that he didn’t get to see the opening of the 80th anniversary season on May 17). John built his little theatre as an indulgence for his wife, a soprano called Audrey Mildmay. To begin with it sat 300 people. As it became more popular, it mushroomed: from 433 in 1936 to 600 in 1952. The festival, renowned for its 'posh picnics' offers cheap tickets to under 30s for just £30 . When Sir George inherited Glyndebourne in 1962, at only 27, the place was still expanding. In 1977 its capacity increased to 850 people. He had to face financial reality — his father had run the opera house at a loss out of his own fortune; the son couldn’t afford such indulgence. Something had to give. For all Glyndebourne’s charm, this gradual, haphazard growth meant the old theatre was, to be honest, a bit of a dog’s dinner — a village hall with a crazy amount of extensions. Things were done on the hoof, literally — stables became offices; garages became rehearsal rooms; outbuildings became scene docks. And so, in 1987, Sir George took the biggest gamble of his life. He decided to knock down his father’s amateurish pride of joy and replace it with a state-of-the-art opera house that would rank with the great opera houses of the world. Traditionalists were outraged —both at the demolition of John Christie’s old-fashioned theatre, and the construction of a daring design by husband-and-wife architects Michael and Patty Hopkins. In fact, the new opera house carefully bridged the gap between the old and new — as Sir George did. Like the manor house, it was built of brick, but was wrapped in copper, and the huge new metal fly tower soared over the mock-Elizabethan windows of the old house. Patrons at Glyndebourne can experience everything from old favourites to the obscure . Even the sceptics were bowled over, and it was soon listed as one of the most important Grade I buildings of the Nineties. Sir George drove a hard bargain, too. For £33 million, he got an opera house built in only seven years that some say should have cost £50 million. The capacity was 1,200. But still, the operas played to full houses. And when it came to money, Sir George conducted a careful balancing act. He realised that the new commercial world meant sponsorship and corporate entertainment were crucial sources of support. He also understood that good opera cost big money. He had the honesty to admit that the best opera ‘is always going to be elitist: there’s no point pretending anything else’. Admittedly, the corporate types are in evidence at Glyndebourne — sometimes more interested in being seen than in seeing the opera. But 30 per cent of the seats are retained for the public, and there are special deals if you sign up as an Associate Member. A fashionable woman on her way to Glyndebourne for a night at the opera .

It was so controversial in an area of outstanding . national beauty that the Government put planning permission on hold, . before allowing the scheme in 2008.

And no one’s said a word or raised a disapproving eyebrow as I get changed in the car park. Like most of the best British events, Glyndebourne is a glorious mix of the shabbily amateur and the slickly professional. Yes, you can spend a fortune at the bar on overpriced champagne and upmarket food. But most Glyndebourne regulars come with their own homemade picnics — from a ham roll and a packet of cheese-and-onion crisps, to heaving baskets crammed with lobster and foie gras. You can eat what you want to eat, drink what you want to drink — again free from any stuffy restrictions or anything as wicked as a corkage charge. You can dine off china on a fold-up table or, as I’ve done, lie in the long grass by the lake, dip one hand in the water and wrap the other around a plastic tumbler of warm white wine. Formal but relaxed, classic but modern, international but thoroughly English. You could say the same of Glyndebourne and its late, much lamented impresario.","Going to the opera at Glyndebourne is no more expensive than a Premier League football match or watching the Rolling Stones .

"By . Julian Robinson . Donna Wright, pictured leaving Newton Aycliffe Magistrates Court, has been described as a 'nasty individual' by Richard Lee . A father has branded an internet hoaxer a 'nasty individual' after she posed as his missing daughter then flouted a court by harassing the family. Donna Wright, 34, broke a restraining order to telephone Richard Lee, whose daughter Katrice has not been seen since she disappeared in a busy Naafi store near a British Army base in Germany in 1981. Wright, from Oak Terrace, West Cornforth, County Durham, was last year sentenced to a 12-week jail term, suspended for 18 months, for harassing Katrice’s mother Sharon in Gosport, Hampshire, and Katrice’s sister Natasha. Wright turned nasty after a DNA test proved she was not the missing girl, and sent spiteful messages over Facebook. After eight court hearings and sacking her solicitor previously, Wright has now admitted also harassing 64-year-old Mr Lee, from Hartlepool, after conclusive phone records were produced. On December 2 last year she rang him at 11.45pm and several times after that, despite a restraining order to prevent her from contacting Katrice’s family. She will be sentenced on June 4 to allow for pre-sentence and psychiatric reports to be produced. District Judge Martin Walker who dealt with her last March will sentence her for the fresh harassment charge. Viv Waugh, defending, told Newton Aycliffe Magistrates’ Court his client had been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder and may have a personality disorder and is undergoing psychiatric treatment. Outside court Mr Lee, who was a sergeant in the King’s Royal Hussars based in Germany when Katrice vanished, was “saddened” that Wright had been able to play the judicial system. He said: 'She is not a fool. 'She has manipulated the system, and as far as I am concerned she is a nasty individual. 'All I want is an end to the whole saga, but a justifiable end.' Pictured is Richard Lee, father of missing girl Katrice Lee, holding a picture of his daughter. He has described Donna Wright as a 'nasty individual' after she flouted a restraining order having claimed to be his daughter . Mr Lee said his family had already battled with the Royal Military Police over the flawed investigation in Katrice’s disappearance. 'We are a family already enduring any parent’s nightmare, and she has come along to take my family away from our true aim which is to find Katrice,' he said. Despite the seriousness of the case, he was able to smile when he recalled the Dad’s Army 'Don’t tell him Pike' moment, when Wright called him last year. He said: 'She rang me at 11.45pm, having already rung other Lees in Hartlepool. Missing toddler Katrice Lee, pictured, was last seen in Germany in 1981 . 'The three times she rang the line went dead. 'Then she rang and said ""I'm doing a line check, is that Richard Lee, father of Katrice Lee?"" 'I said ""Yes it is"", and the phone went dead. 'When she picked it up again it was a ""Don’t tell them Pike moment"". She rang again and I said ""hello Donna"". 'She’s said ""Donna? I’m not Donna Wright"".' Other women have come forward believing they may be Katrice, he said. 'They have had DNA tests as well,' he said. 'But once they have found out they have disappeared gracefully, which this individual has not. 'When it was proved she was not Katrice, she turned nasty. 'Having gone to court, been given an 18-month suspended sentence, she then still starts with me. 'I think she is a sad individual, trying to get her little bit of fame on the back of my family’s misfortune.' Mr Lee believed his daughter was abducted and given a new life. He said: 'Katrice deserves to know who her true parents are. 'I would hope she’s had all the love and care we would have given her. 'She is probably married with children, speaking a different language. 'I could be a grandfather now and not know.' Wright was granted conditional bail. Katrice Lee went missing as her mother was buying crisps at a shop near an Army base in Paderborn, Germany, where her father was stationed with the King's Royal Hussars. It was Katrice's birthday and the family went to a nearby NAAFI to purchase items for a party to mark the occasion. The youngster and her mother were at the check out when Mrs Lee briefly went to get some crisps.But when she returned, Katrice had vanished. At the time, police believed Katrice had fallen into the nearby River Lippe and drowned, but despite searches a body was never found. Officers reopened the case in 2000 after they created a computer-generated image of how she could now look. Her story later appeared on the BBC's Missing Live programme during which a digitial recreation was used to show what she could look like as a 29-year-old. Katrice's older sister Natasha later appeared on Crimewatch to highlight the appeal. Believing she was snatched, her parents – who divorced 20 years ago – later set up a Facebook page dedicated to finding her.","Donna Wright flouted a restraining order to telephone Richard Lee .

"By . Bianca London . It is called labour for a reason, and if you are a woman who has endured the agony of childbirth you may want to look away now. New research claims that the pain of having a football club relegated is the male equivalent to the pain of childbirth (according to a group of football fans). Nearly two-thirds (63 per cent) of season ticket holders polled felt that the pain of relegation was the nearest most men would come to experiencing the pain of giving birth. It's called labour for a reason: A new study reveals that the pain of having your football club relegated is the nearest male equivalent to the pain of childbirth... according to football fans . Even the less committed fans, who attended only one game per season, agreed that relegation was the male equivalent to childbirth. Spare a thought then for the fans of Fulham - including Daniel Radcliffe, Hugh Grant and Piers Brosnan - and Cardiff, whose clubs are now officially relegated from the Premiership this season. And for those of Norwich - including Delia Smith, Stephen Fry, and Hugh Jackman - who look likely to follow them. The survey was conducted by the polling . company TLF, on behalf of Warren United, a new animated sitcom on ITV4 . about a diehard fan of a rubbish football team. Poor them: Spare a thought for the fans of Fulham, such as Daniel Radcliffe, left, and Hugh Grant, right, whose club is now officially relegated from the Premiership . When Bristol Rovers were relegated last week after 94 years as a Football League team, the club’s fans were heartbroken. Fan . Kelly Ballard, tweeted: 'Devastated about Bristol Rovers result. Not . sure how my husband is going to cope though??? ""It's only a game"" won't . cut it.' Pete May, author of the book and blog, “Hammers in the Heart: A Lifetime of Supporting West Ham"", and survivor of multiple West Ham relegations says that only a true fan understands the pain of relegation. 'I remember once when we were relegated seeing this huge skinhead in tears. He was holding his head in his hands and sobbing,' he said. Feeling down: Manager Felix Magath sat dejected on the bench as Fulham were relegated at Stoke . May, of course, has never given birth himself but he has attended the birth of both his daughters, now in their teens. 'I’ve seen childbirth twice and relegation five times', he says. 'Childbirth does look look very painful' he admits, 'but it only lasts a few hours. The pain of relegation lasts all summer.

"By . James Rush . A new study has found lifestyle choices can account for as much as 33 per cent of how old a woman looks . Living an unhealthy lifestyle can age a woman’s skin by over ten years, an in-depth international study has revealed. The . true damage caused by sun beds, smoking and a lack of fruit and . moisturisation in accelerating the ageing process emerged following . research on 585 women in the UK, China and Spain. The . study, published yesterday, showed the factors influencing their skin . were the same even taking into account the backgrounds and skin type of . the women involved. It also emerged 'lifestyle choices' often account for as much as 33 per cent of how old a woman looks. Dr . Andrew Mayes, who led the study for Simple skincare, said: 'We already . knew genetics accounted for about 50 per cent of how old people look, . but we didn’t know how much would be accounted for by their lifestyles. 'Even we were surprised by just how much it was; both in terms of the number of years and the percentage.' The . study which was carried out over the last eight years involved women . aged 45 to 75 in the UK, 30 to 70 in Spain and 25 to 70 in China. Study sites with controlled laboratory conditions were established in Bedford in the UK, Madrid in Spain and Shanghai in China. Those . who took part were asked a string of questions about their lifestyles . including whether or not they liked to sun tan and if they were smokers . or non-smokers. Other . questions included how often the women moisturised, whether they eat fruit and . veg, whether they brush their teeth and if they have all their own . teeth. The research . team also took digital images of the women which were then assessed for . how old they looked to identify their perceived age and whether they . looked younger or older than their actual age. The study, which was carried out over the last eight years, asked women questions about their lifestyle, including whether or not they smoked . Those taking part in the research were also asked whether or not they liked to sun tan and how often they moisturised . The research team, led by Dr Mayes, then compared the perceived ages of those with good versus bad lifestyles. They concluded the difference was 10.4 years. 'We already . knew genetics accounted for about 50 per cent of how old people look, . but we didn’t know how much would be accounted for by their lifestyles' - Dr Andrew Mayes . Dr . Mayes added: 'The number of years' difference was most staggering - we . had just seen some data out of a group of plastic surgeons in the US and . Canada suggesting that a face and neck lift (together with eyelid and . forehead modifications) could take an average of about 8.5 years off . your facial age. 'Then we got our data through demonstrating a saving of over 10 years. It’s fair to say at first we couldn’t quite believe it. 'But . the evidence was there in front of us - women with a healthy lifestyle . looked much younger than those with an unhealthy lifestyle. 'Simply . put; good skin health is about more than fancy creams and lotions - . it’s about how we live our lives and how we treat our bodies and the . steps we need to take do not need to be extreme.","'Lifestyle choices' account for 33 per cent of how old a woman looks .

"By . Darren Boyle . Channel’s 4 broadcasting of the Muslim call to prayer during the holy month of Ramadan was the broadcaster’s most-complained about programme last year. It received 2,011 complaints about its 4Ramadan season with 1,658 specifically about the broadcast of the daily call to prayer. Writing in the broadcaster’s annual report, Channel 4’s head of factual Ralph Lee said: 'The level of Islamophobia we encountered with the 4Ramadan season was unexpected, though much of it came from communities that were either very polarised or very un-diverse.' Scroll down for video . One episode of the series featured a Muslim man praying at different locations around London . The man is seen praying in front of two Metropolitan police officers patrolling on foot . Channel 4 said the month-long series was watched by 5.3 million viewers . He continued: 'It was balanced by an incredibly positive reaction from British Muslims, who were grateful for the acknowledgement of an important moment for them.' Mr Lee said he personally received hundreds of emails complaining about the broadcast after he defended it in a column for Radio Times, where he said it would 'act as a nationwide Tannoy system' and a provocation to viewers 'in the very real sense of the word'. Channel 4 received a total of 16,835 complaints over 2013 with the second most-complained about show being Crazy About One Direction - a documentary about the boyband’s most devoted fans, which attracted 1,056 complaints. During the video the man is seen praying outside a range of London's premier tourist destinations . Channel 4 claimed many of the complainants 'came from communities that were either very polarised or very un-diverse' A Channel 4 spokeswoman said: 'We are clearly not saying that all the complaints we received were Islamophobic in nature, but simply that we were surprised by the level which were.' After Channel 4 announced the Ramadan season of programming, a group called Britain First, who described themselves as a 'patriotic political movement' took to Twitter to proclaim: ' ‘Get ready for a month’s worth of TV programmes pandering to Islam courtesy of Channel 4.’ Terry Sanderson, president of the National Secular Society described the month-long season as a ‘publicity-seeking stunt’. He said: ‘It seems reasonable that there should be some acknowledgment on TV of the needs of the growing Muslim population in Britain, although one can’t help wondering whether this is just another of Channel 4’s publicity-seeking stunts. ‘Given that the BBC devotes hundreds of hours a year to Christianity, with two or three church services every day on its radio stations, and hardly any mention of minority religions, a few minutes devoted to Islam doesn’t seem unreasonable.’ Channel 4 said as well as attracting the most complaints, the show generated the most positive comments of 2013 . Channel 4 said it received 321 appreciative comments concerning its Ramadan series which was also the largest positive reaction of any show during 2013. According to the annual report, the season was watched by 5.3 million people - compared to the British Muslim population of 2.8 million. A spokesperson said: 'The season’s ambition to improve understanding of a minority culture wassuccessful. Four out of five viewers surveyed told us they had learned something new. 'This was Channel 4 fulfilling the spirit of its remit, providing space for an alternative view, unafraid to give a voice to the underrepresented, and producing television thatwas both entertaining and enlightening.'","1,658 people complained about Channel 4's daily broadcast of the call to prayer .

"By . Hugo Duncan . George Osborne received a boost today after figures showed output towards the end of the month close to pre-crisis levels . The longest economic downturn for more than 100 years is finally over, experts said last night. Figures today reveal that output at the end of last month was ‘incredibly close’ to the pre-crisis level of 2008 after a storming start to the year. Jack Meaning, an economist at the influential National Institute of Economic and Social Research think-tank, was confident that nine days into May, output will have surpassed the pre-crash high. ‘By now we will have breached the pre-recession peak,’ he said  last night. The growth spurt at the start of 2014 means the recession is finally over, in a major boost to George Osborne just a year before the General Election. This week the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said the Chancellor has been ‘proven right’ in his decision to stick to his austerity plans in the face of opposition from Labour, the unions and other Left-wing critics. The vote of confidence from one of the world’s leading watchdogs came as research group Markit suggested British firms are hiring 100,000 new staff a month – equal to 1.2million a year. But the recovery has triggered speculation that the Bank of England will be forced to raise interest rates before the end of the year, having held them at an all-time low of 0.5 per cent since 2009. ‘Record low interest rates are no longer necessary,’ said Rob Wood, a former economist at the central bank who now works at Berenberg Bank. ‘The economy is growing  rapidly and, if anything, is picking  up pace.’ Gross Domestic Product – the total size of the economy – dropped by 7.2 per cent in what has been dubbed the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009 under the last Labour government. But figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest output was still 0.6 per below the pre-recession peak at the end of the first quarter in March this year. The National Institute, which is releasing the GDP figures today, is expected to say the economy grew strongly in April, leaving output within 0.1 per cent of the level reached before the crisis. ‘Growth seems to have become entrenched in the UK,’ said  Mr Meaning. The outlook is  pretty robust.’ The Bank of England pegged interest rates at 0.5 per cent again yesterday despite the economy improving . The think-tank predicts growth of 2.9 per cent this year and 2.4 per cent next year – up from February’s  predictions of 2.5 per cent and  2.1 per cent. Unemployment, which has fallen from 7.9 per cent a year ago to 6.9 per cent today, is expected to drop to 6.3 per cent this year and 6 per cent by 2016. However, the National Institute said GDP per capita – the size of the economy as a proportion of the population – will not surpass its pre-crisis peak before 2017. Mr Osborne has declared that ‘Britain is coming back’ but warned that the recovery cannot be taken  for granted. The Bank of England pegged rates at 0.5 per cent again yesterday. But speculation is mounting that the monetary policy committee will be forced to act on rates before too long to cool the housing market and stop the wider economy overheating. The National Institute is not expecting borrowing costs to rise until the second quarter of next year. However the pound has soared to close to $1.70 against the US dollar – up 14 per cent in less than a year – on expectations of an early rate rise. Alex Edwards, an expert at the online currency transfer provider UKForex, said: ‘Markets are increasingly pricing in  a rate hike as early as December  or January.’ George Osborne was under mounting pressure to rein in his controversial Help to Buy mortgage scheme last night. MPs on the Commons Treasury committee warned that it risks fuelling an overheating  housing market. Andrew Tyrie, the committee’s Tory chairman, said there was a ‘risk that the primary effect of the scheme, at least in the short-to-medium term, could be to raise house prices.’ Mr Osborne insists the scheme is helping those who cannot afford a deposit to achieve their dreams of home ownership. But, in a highly unusual move, three former chancellors – Lord Lawson, Lord Lamont and Alistair Darling – joined forces to warn the scheme could create a ‘bubble’. Lord Lamont said: ‘Demand can be increased quickly through measures like Help to Buy but  supply can only be increased slowly. My concern is it will become even harder for young people to buy a home.’","Figures show economic output last month nearly at pre-crisis levels .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Michael Gove has written to all schools and colleges in England warning them to watch out for signs of radicalisation and other forms of child abuse . Michael Gove has written to all schools and colleges in England urging them to watch out for signs of radicalisation in the wake of the so-called Trojan Horse plot. In a letter to headteachers, the Education Secretary said schools and colleges must be aware of any type of child abuse. He said this included radicalisation as well as cyberbullying, sexual exploitation and female genital mutilation. The Department of Education advice included links to existing guidance from a variety of organisations. One of those was Channel - part of a government strategy to protect people at risk of being radicalised. The information said those at risk might possess 'material or symbols associated with an . extremist cause (e.g. the swastika for far right groups)'. It added they 'spend . increasing time in the company of other suspected extremists' or attempt . to recruit others to their cause. The advice suggests a change in appearance or clothing as well as a loss of interest in friends may also be clues of radicalisation. The document said: 'Channel is about . protecting people from radicalisation into all forms of terrorism, but . the most significant threat to this country is from Al Qa’ida . affiliated, influenced and associated groups.' The advice comes as The National . Association of Headteachers claimed schools across Britain have been . targeted in the alleged Trojan Horse plot. The plot involves the alleged ousting of headteachers, mainly in and around the Birmingham area, by Islamic extremists attempting to take over several top schools in a bid to target vulnerable young people. The Park View School in Birmingham - which, according to whistleblowers, has been infiltrated by Islamic extremists who are attempting to change the school and target young people . Last . week, association members said they had ‘serious concerns’ about attempts to . ‘alter the character’ of at least six schools  - before warning efforts had . been made to infiltrate a number of classrooms across the country. At least 20 schools are currently being investigated in wake of the claims. The so-called Trojan Horse plot first came to light earlier this year. Department for Education inspectors were ordered into Park View School in Birmingham along with its sister schools, Golden Hillock and Nansen, after a letter dubbed 'Trojan Horse' was uncovered. It allegedly outlined a plot by Muslim hardliners to drive moderate headteachers out of schools. Whistleblowers at Park View have claimed the school is in the hands of a group of extremists who infiltrated the governing body. It is alleged girls at the school were forced to sit at the back of the classroom and non-Muslim pupils forced to teach themselves at the state school. The letter prompted separate ongoing investigations by both the Department for Education (DfE) and Ofsted in to the school and several others in the area. The DfE has also appointed its own . education commissioner, the former head of the Metropolitan Police’s . counter-terrorism unit Peter Clarke for the investigation. Following the allegations, the school was placed in to special measures. Another 21 are thought to be under investigation by schools watchdog Ofsted. Birmingham City Council is also investigating 25 schools. Last week The National Association of Head Teachers said it had ‘serious concerns’ about attempts to ‘alter the character’ of at least six schools - warning the 'plot' was spreading across the country. Two teachers in Bradford have since left their jobs - with a third claiming their are being forced out - in the latest twist to the story. The Department for Education's newly updated advice said everyone working in a school or college should be aware of the signs of abuse and neglect 'so that they are able to identify cases of children who may be in need of help or protection' and can take action. Today, Mr Gove wrote: 'The guidance reiterates that staff members working with . children should always think ‘it could happen here’ where safeguarding . is concerned. 'School and . college staff are particularly important as they are in a position to . identify concerns early and provide help for children, to prevent . concerns from escalating.' In a specific section on female genital mutilation (FGM) it said that all professionals needed to be 'alert to the possibility of a girl being at risk of FGM, or already having suffered FGM'. It added that girls at risk of the practice may not know they were in danger. The so-called 'Trojan Horse’ plot is the alleged takeover in secular schools by Muslim extremists. Some claim they are attempting to infiltrate state schools and run them according to Islamic principles. One of the most high-profile schools involved in the claims, Park View Academy in Birmingham, has been condemned for increasing ‘Islamisation’. It is claimed the school has hosted extremist preachers during assemblies and encouraged girls to cover their hair. The school was recently subject to an emergency investigation by schools watchdog Ofsted and was put in to special measures. At the end of last month, a list of 18 schools  under investigation in and around Birmingham was released. Last week, Ofsted announced inspections were investigating a further three schools, bringing the total to 21.","Education Secretary has written to all schools and colleges in England .

"By . Ben Spencer . If you can’t remember where you left your watering can and haven’t seen your secateurs for years, you are not alone. More than half of us are intermittent gardeners who rather than carefully water our borders are more likely to hope it rains. A study of horticultural habits has identified six categories of gardener – with 18 per cent falling into a ‘hands-off’ group who rely on the weather to take care of their plants. Occasional: Of those who do some gardening, most admit to hoping for rain to keep their plants healthy . They are likely to tidy up their gardens every spring, but rarely take any other action to look after their green space. The findings were part of a wide-ranging study into water usage in south-east England. The team of researchers from the Universities of Manchester, Edinburgh, Southampton and Lancaster investigated the daily habits of 1,800 households, with the aim of developing better water usage policy. Some 56 per cent of those surveyed fell into the two categories who never watered their gardens. A vast majority - 91 per cent of those they surveyed - had some kind of outdoor space at their home, 87 per cent including a back garden. But 38 per cent said they had ‘nothing to water’ - in many cases because they had paved over their lawn or simply had abandoned their plants. Another 18 per cent said they rely on rain to keep their gardens irrigated. Dr Alison Browne, of the University of Manchester, said there are six ‘broad variants’ of gardener - with no obvious link to their socioeconomic class or professional standing. She said: ‘The overriding impression is that they’re not as green fingered as Monty Don fans might imagine - that’s assuming they have any plants at all, or feel that those they do have need to be watered.’ Another 18 per cent of people were classified as ‘casual gardeners’, the kind of people who have a few token shrubs or potted flowers. They use a jug or watering can to tend to their plants, filling it up from the kitchen sink or an outdoor tap. Some 16 per cent are ‘high-tec gardeners’, keen horticulturists who use a hosepipe, sprinkler or automated irrigation system to keep the lawn green and flowers in good health. The researchers grouped 5 per cent into a ‘green fingered’ category. These gardeners are committed environmentalists, using recycled water such as rain in outdoor butts, or even carefully collected waste bath or kitchen water. Green fingered folk are likely to grow fruit, vegetables and native flowers, the academics said, and often feed and nurture the wildlife in their gardens. A final category is made up of ‘amateur enthusiasts’, those with small gardens, usually in city centres, but who are serious about horticulture. They are likely to grow their own fruit and vegetables, often in pots or tubs, and use a watering can to keep everything healthy. The research team said the findings has implications for the effectiveness of water policy. The paper, published in the Journal of Water Supply, said: ‘[The results] serve to illustrate that how individuals water the garden varies, often with little relationship to their sociodemographic characteristics. ‘Fully 56 per cent of respondents reported that their gardening practice involved no watering, with clear water use implications. ‘It is notable how many households do not water their gardens, and also how many only use jugs or watering cans.’ The authors also suggested that even those who do use lots of water might be improving the environment in other ways. The paper said: ‘Garden watering overlaps with other substantial environmental issues, such as the potential beneficial effects of planting native species or having wild areas for biodiversity, or growing food at home, potentially reducing food miles. ‘Trade-offs between agendas may then exist: encouraging reduced water use per se might not be the best goal.’ Dr Browne said the findings show that hosepipe bans in times of drought might only affect a small proportion of people. ‘Our findings provide food for thought for those implementing hosepipe bans and non-essential use bans,’ she said. ‘Although these bans do raise awareness of the importance of using less water, we think it would be good to think about different approaches to tackling behaviour leading up to drought. ‘We also urge the water industry to think differently how they might intervene to improve water efficiency.’ ‘The garden is one of the few areas of watering practices over which policy makers can provide external control through non-essential use bans. So these results may provide useful insight in terms of identifying trigger points for action and communication in periods of drought.’","Survey outlined different approaches to caring for gardens .

"By . Becky Barrow, Business Correspondent . The number of unemployed women aged 50 and older has increased by almost half since the Coalition came to power, according to official figures. Experts warn that women searching for work are particularly vulnerable at a time when the State pension age is rising. Before David Cameron entered Downing Street in 2010, there were 111,000 unemployed women aged 50  and older. Before David Cameron, pictured, entered Downing Street in 2010, there were 111,000 unemployed women aged 50  and older - today there are 162,000 . Today there are 162,000, according to the Office for National Statistics – a 45 per cent increase. While women have suffered in the jobs market, men have not. Over the same four-year period, the number of unemployed men has plunged from 263,000 to 229,000, according to the ONS. Women used to be able to start claiming their State pension at the age of 60, but this is being gradually increased under the Government’s timetable. It is currently 62 and  one month. Under the current plan, the State pension age for men and women will reach 65 by 2018, 66 by 2020, 67 by 2028, 68 by the ‘mid-2030s’ and 69 by the ‘late-2040s’. Labour warns older women are being failed by the Government’s flagship employment scheme, the Work Programme. Under the scheme, providers from the voluntary, private and public  sectors are paid according to results to get people into work, with extra incentives to support the hardest  to help. Shadow equalities minister Sharon Hodgson, says David Cameron has 'no answer to the cost of living crisis affecting tens of thousands of older women and their families.' Sharon Hodgson, the shadow equalities minister, said: ‘These  figures are yet more proof that David Cameron has no answer to the cost of living crisis affecting tens of  thousands of older women and  their families. ‘His Work Programme is failing them, and thousands more find themselves unemployed under  this Government. ‘If we’re going to build a sustainable recovery, we need to ensure that  we don’t waste the talents of some  of our most experienced and  valuable workers.’ However, a spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions dismissed Labour’s claim as  ‘absolute nonsense’. She said the rise in the number of unemployed older women can only be seen in the context of a much larger increase in the number of women in this age group who have decided to enter the workforce. Around 250,000 older women aged between 50 and 64 have moved from ‘inactivity’ – that is, not looking for work – to either working or looking for work over the last four years. The DWP spokesman said: ‘The proportion of women between 50 and 64 who are in work is at its highest level ever.’ She added that the Government will ‘shortly’ appoint a business champion for older workers.","Experts warn that women seeking work are vulnerable as State pension age rises .

'Jayden is just a normal little boy. He is quite tall and broad for his age, but he is in proportion. 'When we take him swimming you can see his ribcage. He is very active - he walks home from school, he goes out on his trampoline and rides his bike. 'We have a healthy lifestyle and set him a good example. When I go out running he will come with me on his bike for a couple of miles. 'He would happily eat a stick of carrot over a bit of chocolate, but there is nothing wrong with having a treat now and again. ""'It is very patronising to be told your child is overweight in this way.' Jayden's school used the Body Mass Index to determine that the five year old was was too heavy for a boy of his age . The youngster from Fernwood, Notts is 3ft 9 inches tall and weighs 3st 10lbs. But according to height and weight measurements taken as part of the National Child Measurement Programme, used to calculate a body mass index (BMI) score, he is overweight for his age and sex. Mrs Timmermans said she was concerned the programme could put pressure on young children to start dieting. Jayden brought the Notts County Council letter home from Chuter Ede Primary School in Balderton, Notts. It read: 'The results suggest your child is overweight for their age, sex and height. If your child is overweight now, they are more likely to grow up to be overweight as an adult. This can lead to health problems. 'You and Jayden can make simple changes to be more active and eat more healthily.' A Change 4 Life leaflet was enclosed with the letter, which also advised Mrs Timmermans to contact a patient advice and liaison service (PALS). It did not say by how much Jayden was supposedly overweight, or what his BMI score was. Mrs Timmermans added: 'There is so much pressure on adults to be thin, never mind children, and it is not fair to make children think they are overweight. 'Children are still growing and BMI does not take into account growth spurts. Some children have puppy fat before shooting up. 'Common sense tells me Jayden is not fat, but some parents may worry their children need to lose weight. 'That puts pressure on them and you don't want children exposed to dieting at that age.' According to Jayden's mother Samatha, the youngster would prefer eating a carrot slice to a chocolate bar and is very active . The Body Mass Index is used to measure their amount of body fat a person is carrying. Medics use a modified BMI scale with children that takes account of their age and sex. One in three children in Britain is classed as 'overweight' according to official government figures. Children are classed as either underweight, healthy weight, overweight or very overweight. According the National Childhood Measurement Programme: 'It can be difficult to tell if your child is overweight as they may look similar to other children of their age. That’s why we use the measurement of weight against height to get an accurate measure.'Research shows that if your child is overweight now, they are more likely to grow up to be overweight as an adult. This can lead to health problems in later life, so this measurement is an important way of checking how your child is growing.' Anne Pridgeon, a senior public health manager at Notts County Council, said the measurement programme was an important way of monitoring how many children in the county were overweight, and ensuring the right public health approach was taken. She added: 'If we can help ensure our children maintain a healthy weight, evidence shows they will have less weight-related health issues later in life. 'The measurement programme can act as an early warning to flag to parents there may a developing issue that can be addressed.' The programme was introduced to help tackle child obesity. Under the national scheme all four and five-year-olds and children aged 10 to 11 have their height and weight measured to create a national childhood obesity database. However, there has been some criticism of using BMI to determine whether someone was overweight or not. At 5ft 10 and weighing 14 stone 9, former British and Irish Lion captain Brian O'Driscoll has a BMI of 29.3 and is classed as overweight. Overweight? Brian O'Driscoll has a BMI of 29.3 and according to NHS guidelines the former British and Ireland Lions captain is officially overweight .","Jayden Timmermans weighs less than four stone and is very active .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Convicted: Sex offender James Burns worked as an airport security officer frisking passengers, despite facing fresh allegations of abusing a teenage boy . A convicted sex offender worked as an airport security officer frisking passengers, despite facing fresh allegations of abusing a teenage boy. James Burns, 56, was employed as an aviation security officer at Manchester Airport after passing a criminal record and counter terrorism check. However, the checks failed to highlight . his previous convictions for historic sexual assaults because the Police . National Computer at that time did not include all offences from the 70s . and 80s. Burns was given tasks including patting down passengers during security checks carried out before travellers are allowed to board an aircraft. But at the time he was offered the job in 2013 Burns was being investigated by police over new allegations of abusing a 16-year-old boy, who can not be named for legal reasons. He failed to tell his bosses about the allegations and it was not until he was convicted after a trial at Manchester Crown Court earlier this year that Burns came clean with bosses as his past came to light. Burns, Westhoughton, Bolton, was suspended on full pay after he was found guilty of four counts of sexual assault on a 16-year-old boy. However, he has still not been sacked despite the fact that this week he was given a nine month sentence suspended for two years and a 12-month supervision order. He was also placed on the sexual offenders register for ten years and subject to a sexual offences prevention order, which means he cannot be allowed unsupervised access to any children under 16, and must not seek to befriend any male under that age. The court was told that between August and December in 2007, Burns assaulted the victim, telling him that he was gay, despite the fact he was married with a wife and children. Burns also bombarded the teenager with sexually explicit and suggestive text messages, telling him that no one would believe him if he told anyone about the abuse. The victim received up to 40 lewd text messages a night, and said he was showered with gifts and cash by Burns. At the time of the offences Burns ran his own courier business, but his firm folded in 2010 and he later applied for and got the job at the airport. Workplace: Burns worked as an aviation security officer at Manchester Airport, and his role included physical contact with passengers, checking them as they went through the security gates . The victim came forward in 2012 after seeking medical help from his GP. During his trial it was revealed that Burns had previous convictions for indecent assault on a teenage boy in 1980 when he impersonated a police officer, and two convictions for public order offences in 1983 and 1984 for propositioning young men for sex in Bolton. Burns worked as an aviation security officer at the airport, and his role included physical contact with passengers, checking them as they went through the security gates. A Manchester Airport spokesman said: 'All security officers are given a criminal records check and a counter terrorism check, before they can be based at a UK airport, and the checks highlighted no disqualifying offences. Security: A spokesman for Manchester Airport said that all staff underwent criminal checks before starting work . Still employed: An airport spokesman said that Burns remained suspended on full pay from his job following his conviction . 'Had the check shown up the offences from the 1980s Burns would have been disqualified from working at the airport.' The spokesman added that Burns remained suspended on full pay from his job. The Police National Computer database is continually being updated with historic offences. It is understood that the offences carried out by Burns had not been added to the database at the time he was arrested in 2012.","James Burns worked as an aviation security officer at Manchester Airport .

"By . Paul Hirst, Press Association . Sir Bobby Charlton is certain Manchester United will finish above their bitter rivals City next year. City's 4-0 win over Aston Villa means they need just one point from their final game of the season to win the Barclays Premier League. United, meanwhile, are 20 points behind their neighbours in seventh place. They are likely to miss out on European qualification altogether thanks to a disastrous campaign under David Moyes, who was recently fired just 10 months after being appointed successor to Sir Alex Ferguson. On the rise: Sir Bobby Charlton believes United will finish above rivals City next season . But the club's all-time top goal scorer, who is now a director at Old Trafford, has told City the balance of power will swing back in United's favour next year. 'This year has been an tremendously interesting year,' said Charlton, who played 758 times for the club. 'We have done our best, we have changed manager, and it has not worked. Rising star: James Wilson showed a gimps into United's future . 'But next year I guarantee that we will be number one in Manchester.' Charlton confirmed that Moyes' successor, likely to be Louis van Gaal, will have money to spend. 'We will have to buy a couple of players, which will happen,' added Charlton, who was speaking at the Manchester United player of the year awards. 'I am looking forward a lot to next year because Manchester United is not renowned for being second. 'We like to be first and we will be first. We have the most fantastic organisation and that organisation when it works is unstoppable.' Van Gaal's appointment will not be . confirmed until after Ryan Giggs' final game of his interim spell as player-manager on Sunday at Southampton. Talking a good game: Sir Bobby Charlton believes United's future is bright . Giggs could play on for another year, join the new manager's backroom staff or manage at another club. The Welshman picked up the United lifetime achievement award at Thursday night's ceremony at Old Trafford - an honour usually reserved in sport for those coming towards the end of their careers. But Giggs insists he has not yet made his mind up yet. Decision to make: Ryan Giggs says he has yet to decide about his future . 'I have not decided,' the 40-year-old said. 'I am too busy trying to prepare a team for Southampton and that is my priority at the moment. 'When the season ends I will go away and think about what I want to do next. 'I said five or six years ago that if my career ended tomorrow I would be happy so every year is a bonus. 'I still enjoy training and playing but I have really enjoyed the last couple of weeks so it has been a good experience to take me on to the next chapter of my life.' Pride of Manchester: Edin Dzeko and City stand on the brink of winning the title . Just like Charlton, Giggs is sure United will perform much better next season. 'It's been a disappointing season but if you are a proper club, which we are, you always bounce back,' said Giggs, who made his debut for United in 1991. 'In football you have setbacks. In my first full season we lost out to Leeds in the league and I was sat in the dressing room as an 18 year-old watching grown men cry. 'We came back the next year and won the league for the first time in 26 years and there is not a doubt in my mind that we will be back next year, we will be challenging and that is what proper clubs do - they have setbacks and come back stronger.'","Charlton says Man United will be the No 1 side in Manchester .

A prison clerk was today facing jail after having a secret relationship with a gangster who is serving a life sentence for murder. Kathryn Finch, 37, shared dozens of illicit phone conversations with Carl Gordon as she worked at HMP Swaleside on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent. Gordon, now 27, was locked up in 2006 after stabbing to death Michael Campbell, 21, in Turnham Green, west London, following a row over a vandalised car. During his time at the category B prison, the former gym instructor also joined forces with arms dealer, Paul Alexander, to run an underworld gun ring from behind bars. Alexander, 58, supplied weapons to the gang behind the murder of 11-year-old Rhys Jones, who was gunned down by Sean Mercer, 16, aided by six others, on his way home from football practice in Croxteth, Liverpool, in 2007. During their relationship, Gordon and Finch exchanged 25 phone calls and more than 60 text messages between April 13 and May 31, 2011, Southwark Crown Court heard. Adam King, prosecuting, told the court: ‘There were 11 calls and 31 text messages from Mrs Finch to Carl Gordon. ‘There were 14 calls and 32 text messages from Gordon to Mrs Finch. Gordon has been convicted of a firearms conspiracy going on during that time using that mobile phone.’ Finch today admitted a single charge of unauthorised transmission of an image of sound by electronic communication from within a prison.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The number of step families has slumped by 14 per cent in a decade, as women delay having children, new figures show. The changing face of Britain’s families was revealed by data showing there were 544,000 families with children living with a stepparent in 2011, down from 631,000 ten years earlier. Couples who move in together with children from previous relationships are also being priced out parts of the country, because need larger homes with more bedrooms. The proportion of stepfamilies is lowest in London and the South East, where house prices are higher, suggesting larger families are being priced out of some areas . Between 2001 and 2011 the number of families where children lived with both parents rose by 4 per cent. But at the same time the number of stepfamilies fell by 14 per cent, the Office for National Statistics said. The dramatic change could be linked to several factors, including the decline in the number of children born to younger parents who are more likely to split up. The ONS said there were ‘no clear reasons’ for the fall in the number of stepfamilies but possible factors include a rise in the average age at which women have their first baby. ‘This means that children are less likely to be born to younger couples who are more likely to break up. This may lessen the chance of children becoming stepchildren later on,’ the ONS said. Single parents may also be increasingly likely to have a partner who lives elsewhere and essentially acts as a stepparent to their children without living with them permanently. Some 85 per cent of stepfamilies include children from the woman’s previous relationship, 11m-er cent included children from the man’s previous relationship and 4 per cent from both partners’ previous relationships, according to the General Lifestyle Survey in 2011 for Great Britain. Almost one in 10 children lives in a stepfamily, the Office for National Statistics said . Suprrisngly, the proportion of stepfamilies varied across the country with numbers lowest in London and the South East where property prices are highest. The ONS said: ‘The lowest proportions of couple families with dependent children which were stepfamilies in 2011 were in and to the west of London, extending along the M4 corridor. ‘Meanwhile, the highest proportions were in coastal areas, south Wales, Norfolk and the East Midlands. ‘Several reasons may contribute to this pattern including the presence of affordable housing because stepfamilies tend to be larger. ‘For example, the cost of homes with enough bedrooms to accommodate children may prevent some people who both have children from moving in together in London and the South East.’ Among stepfamilies where the parents have married, 28 per cent have three or more dependent children compared with 17 per cent of married couple non-stepfamilies. Stepfamilies tend to be larger, in part because they can include children from both previous relationships . ‘This may be expected as some couples may have one or more children from a previous relationship and go on to have another child within their current relationship,’ the ONS said. ‘Alternatively, children may come from both partners’ previous relationships.’ The number of stepfamilies in an area could also be linked to the number of lone parents. ‘People from certain ethnic groups may have a lower likelihood of divorcing or having children outside marriage, and so of forming stepfamilies. These groups are not evenly spread around the country,’ the ONS added. In England and Wales 1.1 million of children lived in a stepfamily in 2011, equivalent to 9 per cent. A total of 7.7 million, or 64 per cent, of children lived with both of their parents and 3.1 million or 26 per cent lived with a single parent. The majority of children living in stepfamilies lived with parents who have married - 689,000 compared to 418,000 where the parents in the stepfamily have not tied the knot.","Number of stepfamilies falls from 631,000 in 2001 to 544,000 in 2011 .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Apology: Jenny Kleeman, pictured reporting from Nigeria in 2011, was told to stop breast-feeding her son, but stood her ground . A mother has won an apology from a London shopping centre after a security guard tried to stop her breastfeeding in public. Jenny Kleeman, a journalist and film-maker, was feeding her son in a café at the O2 shopping centre in Hampstead, North London, when she was asked to leave by security. She was told to move upstairs out of view next to a collection of nappy bins to feed the child, six-month-old Benjamin, after a guard intervened. However, Ms Kleeman stood her ground and forced the centre - as well as the Apostrophe café she was sitting in - to make an unreserved apology to her. She said: 'I was feeding my son, incredibly discreetly, with a friend of mine when a security guard approached me. 'I . said I was fine at the table, and he said it was not allowed. When I . challenged him saying it was against the law to try to prohibit me, he . said it was private property and he did not make the rules. Representatives of Apostrophe later claimed that the guard was acting in response to a complaint from another customer. But Ms Kleeman - who has reported from war zones as well as going undercover for months to pull off stories - refused to back down and continued feeding her son. She told the Evening Standard: 'I . think the security guard did not really know who he was picking on. I . know women who may not feel confident enough to stand up to something . like that. I was not going to use a poo-filled box feeding ghetto. A spokesman for the O2 centre - who were responsible for the guard, rather than Apostrophe, said: 'Iit is not our policy to prevent breast feeding anywhere within the O2 Centre, or indeed any of our shopping centres, and the security guard who spoke to you did not act in line with our policy.' A representative of Apostrophe said: 'We would never prevent a mother from feeding her child. Our apologies once again for the disruption and upset this has caused.'

"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . The highly divisive nature of FA chairman Greg Dyke’s England Commission was demonstrated by the answer an FA councillor received when asking about the conspicuous lack of schools football in the report. Peter Beverley, a former McKinsey consulting executive who has led Dyke’s research team, told John Reid, the English Schools FA representative, after a Wembley presentation: ‘I did not know they still played football in schools.’ This infuriated Reid, especially as schools football is seen by many as an area that should have been investigated by Dyke’s commission. Finger pointing: There were surprising omissions from Greg Dyke's England proposals, including schools football . Another strange omission in the report was any mention of the proposed north-south regionalisation of lower-league football that had been championed by Glenn Hoddle during Commission meetings. It is understood that was pulled from the final, hastily-put-together report at the last moment, despite forming part of the original draft. The most bizarre aspect of the Wembley briefing was that Greg Dyke chose to have ex-England full back Danny Mills, the surprise choice on the Commission panel, to his right. Dyke had difficulty getting a word in edgeways, so often did Mills and his fellow panellist, former Leeds manager Howard Wilkinson, hijack questions aimed only at Dyke. Chatty pair: Howard Wilinson (left) and Danny Mills (centre) interrupted Dyke often in the press conference . Leeds' former managing director David Haigh was interviewed by Yorkshire Police on Thursday over the installation of spy cameras within Elland Road following complaints made by new owner Massimo Cellino alleging misuse of club funds for the purchase of the equipment. Haigh said in a statement that surveillance devices were quite properly paid for by the club and were put in place following reports to him alleging the use of Class A drugs within the club. However, the police are only looking into the alleged misuse of funds rather than any perceived drugs culture at the troubled club. THE FA’s search for a £9million-a-year Cup sponsor to replace Budweiser next season may end with the Turkish-owned household appliance giants Beko stepping up from their lower-tier supply deal. Beko have the financial power for a big football partnership, although their sports sponsorships focus on basketball. Clubs’ £50m VAT bill . The Premier League are understood to have negotiated for around 15 of their clubs to pay a total of £50million in tax to settle a VAT dispute. It concerns agents who exploited a grey area in the regulations by claiming they represented clubs rather than players, who never want any avoidable extra tax landing on their bill. The vast payments emerged during a court case involving agent Tony McGill, who is suing Bolton Wanderers and others for being cut out of the £1m Gavin McCann transfer from Aston Villa to Bolton in 2007. Bolton chairman Phil Gartside told the court his club had paid £1.8m to settle their dual representation issue, which was a ‘relatively small amount compared to others’. It is believed Tottenham, Manchester United, Manchester City and Newcastle sorted out their tax affairs without PL assistance. Bombshell: David Haigh, Leeds' former managing director was interviewed by Yorkshire Police following complaints from Massimo Cellino (below) over the installation of spy cameras within Elland Road . The Joey Barton autobiography due out in August must be causing publishers Penguin plenty of angst judging by the extraordinary reaction of commissioning editor Dan Bunyard to a harmless enquiry about the date of publication. Bunyard, who is in charge of the Barton project, put the phone down while shouting ‘Scum’. When asked later about this offensive attitude to newspapers, he said: ‘I apologise but I was angry about having to answer so many questions about the book.’ It will only add to hostilities between the Premier League and the FA that Greg Dyke chose to rush out his recommendations on a day when PL chief executive Richard Scudamore was due to hold media interviews about Sunday’s climax to the season. The PL claim their Under 21 league, panned by Dyke in his report, offers a better technical challenge for young players than the FA proposals. And top-flight insiders compared him picking off individual clubs for support rather than the PL collective to his predecessor Lord Triesman’s tactics when he took on the PL over debt. Off the record: Joey Barton's autobiography must be causing publishers' Penguin plenty of problems .","Schools football was strange omission from Greg Dyke's England propsal .

Meyler will be waiting anxiously to see if the FA take any action after he appeared to deliberately stand on Januzaj's outstretched leg towards the end of the game.

"It’s very rare to look at a professional photograph these days and not assume it’s been digitally altered. But one artist is bucking the digital trend – refusing to use Photoshop and taking his photographs with analogue cameras. Ukrainian photographer Oleg Oprisco’s photographs are born out of his imagination and bringing them to life takes more hard work than the average photo shoot. Roll it up: One model rolls up what appears to be pre-grown grass and slings it under her arm, while another lays down a piece of fabric, while holding a vintage sewing machine . Flower children: A model is photographed with a bouquet of flowers on her head, while butterflies fly out of the other model's book . Oleg commenced his career at 16-years-old, where he would play around in his spare time while working at a photo lab. Speaking with photography blog I Still Shoot Film, he admitted that the challenge of shooting on film is what excites him. ‘I see film photography as a game in a casino. You can win big or lose it all. I press the shutter release button and then I have to wait to find out the results when the film is processed,’ he said. ‘It’s a very cool feeling, addictive like a drug.’ Windows into the soul: One model is perched atop a crumbling shack, with the other standing next to a tree covered in intricate bird feeders . The sea, the sea: Both models are photographed near the ocean, birds circle above one and the other holds just one red balloon . Fielding out a landscape: Both models stand in a field - one appears to be painting the grass green, while the other appears to be burning the crop to the ground . Captured using Kiev 6C and Kiev 88 medium format cameras, Oleg uses a variety of lenses to get the effect he desires. With twelve shots captured to each roll of film, he’s also unable to review the captured photographs until the film is developed. While the photographs are not created using Photoshop, he does admit to using them to digitally modify the images. Not to create the sets or resize the props, merely to correct the colouring in the final images and remove specks of dust from the frame. Deciding what he will shoot isn’t even the struggle, as it is for so many artists. Preparing the shoot doesn’t involve a keyboard and mouse, but a notepad and pen. Painting the town red: Red features prominently in both photographs - where one has flaming red hair hanging to the side of her cape, the other appears to be painting the leaves red . Shine a light on me: One model is walking out of a tunnel with a fire ball in her hand, while a male model struggles to kiss what appears to be his lover - her body shrouded in sheer material . Taking a trip: The model on the left rides through the sky, while the one on the right sits perched on top of a stack of oversized vintage luggage . The props themselves would often take days to create – with the photos featured containing fake butterflies of varying sizes, oversized matchsticks, a stack of fake books, up to 21 light wooden bird feeders and pile of oversized vintage-style luggage. On top of that, there’s hair, costumes and makeup to take into consideration. Oleg Oprisco is based in Ukraine. Anybody interested in purchasing his art can visit his website or Facebook page.

"By . Bianca London . Cultural icons like David Beckham and the Royal family help the UK's luxury brands outperform its global rivals in emerging markets, new research has found. A survey of Chinese consumers in Shanghai, Beijing and those that travel thousands of miles to the UK to shop at places like Harrods, Harvey Nichols and House of Fraser found that ‘Britishness’ was an important reason they chose to buy brands like Johnnie Walker, Aston Martin, Rolls Royce, Burberry and Gieves & Hawkes. The study by Professor Qing Wang of Warwick Business School found that Britain’s cultural capital represents a number of unique qualities that is difficult for competitors in France, Italy or the US to imitate. The Becks and George effect: New research has found that cultural icons like David Beckham, left, and Prince George help the UK's luxury brands outperform its global rivals in emerging markets . When asked what the Chinese consumers associate with Britishness, not surprisingly, the Royal family came top of the list, followed by David Beckham, the Football Premier League and the 2012 London Olympics. TV programmes and movies like Downton Abbey, the Harry Potter films, Sherlock Holmes, James Bond and BBC News also had a huge influence on the Chinese perception of Britishness, and so does the British elite education system represented by Oxbridge and the public schools. Professor Wang, who will be presenting the preliminary findings of her research at The Geography of Luxury: East, West and Global Directions conference at University of Warwick this week, said: 'Luxury goods are defined as those satisfying hedonic rather than functional needs and our research has found this is an area that Britain enjoys a distinct advantage in. 'A very important factor that makes Britain standout is that it incorporates tradition and innovation seamlessly. Fashion pack: Burberry's annual revenues hit £2 billion for the first time in 2013 thanks mainly to sales in China jumping 20 per cent year on year. Here, Cara Delevingne leads the fash pack at the AW14 show . British flair: TV programmes and movies like Downton Abbey (cast pictured), the Harry Potter films, Sherlock Holmes, James Bond and BBC News also had a huge influence on the Chinese perception of Britishness . 'Put differently, Britain’s advantage lies in the so-called soft power, which is defined as the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than through coercion and cultural heritage is a key part of that. The extent of its impact is hard to measure and even harder to replicate. As China promotes its own soft power, it has increasingly turned to Britain for inspiration.' The love of British luxury goods in China and other emerging markets is all too clearly demonstrated by the sales figures. Diageo derives about a third of its profits from Scotch whisky brands, driven by demand in China, India and Russia, making Diageo the world's biggest Scotch whisky producer. Jaguar Land Rover, the UK’s leading manufacturer of premium luxury vehicles, saw sales in China up 39 per cent in January 2014. Similarly, annual revenues at Burberry hit £2 billion for the first time in 2013 thanks mainly to sales in China jumping 20 per cent year on year, with the fashion retailer set to open eight more stores in the country this financial year. Big spenders: The survey of Chinese consumers in Shanghai, Beijing and those that travel thousands of miles to the UK to shop at places like Harrods, pictured, found that 'Britishness' was an important reason why . Navdeep Athwal, a doctoral researcher in Warwick Business School’s marketing group, found in a separate study, that the lure of luxury spreads into other consumer segments. 'There is a trickle-down effect from the tailor-made luxury product segment with high price tags and exclusivity benefits to other consumer segments where more affordable and mainstream luxury goods are offered,' she said. 'Members of luxury goods consumer-led virtual communities seek to emulate the behaviour of their elite counterparts and to gain the same levels of status and recognition.' Professor Wang added: 'Yet this trickle-down effect of conspicuous consumption to middle-class consumers is threatening the very essence of luxury being exclusive. 'Emerging markets like China and India offer huge potential for luxury marketers where advertising efforts should focus on ""selling the dream"" and creating stronger ties with the super-rich. For luxury firms unique and customised product offerings combined with exquisite craftsmanship and the British association will continue to drive sales in emerging markets.'","Study shows Chinese shoppers cite 'Britishness' as reason to buy .

Camilla, 66, beamed as she was greeted outside the base by cheering children waving Union flags but looked more fragile than usual as she toured the North Yorkshire airfield. During her visit, which was arranged to mark the opening of a new medical centre, the Duchess met wounded personnel, among them Corporal Paul Bentley-Crane, who showed the royal how some of the state-of-the-art equipment is used. Scroll down for video . Brave face: Camilla looked tired but made time to stop and chat with children waiting outside the airfield . Another 'injured' serviceman to greet the Duchess was Leading Aircraftsman Nathan Hart, who shook hands with the 66-year-old from the comfort of one of the brand new beds. Camilla, who was wearing a pale green coat and a pair of neat tan court shoes, later shook hands with a group of excited children who had waited outside to meet her. Mr Shand, the Duchess of Cornwall's younger brother, died in a freak accident in New York last month. The 62-year-old conservationist and travel writer had been hosting a charity auction on behalf of  Elephant Family at Sotheby's but slipped and struck his head on the pavement as he tried to re-enter the Rose Bar at the Gramercy Park Hotel through a revolving door after going for a drink with a relative.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . An enormous region of East Antarctica is far more vulnerable to thaw that previously thought, according to a new study. Researchers claim that global warming could trigger an unstoppable slide of ice into the ocean and raise world sea levels for thousands of years. The Wilkes Basin in East Antarctica, stretching more than 600 miles (1,000 km) inland, has enough ice to raise world sea levels by 10 to 13 feet (three to four metres). A study has said 'unstable ice plugs' are all that is holding back a giant sheet of ice known as the Wilkes Basin in East Antarctica. If they were to melt, the ice sheet could raise sea levels by up to four metres (13 feet) over the next few thousand years. Pictured is a large pack of floating ice known as an ice floe near East Antarctica . The Wilkes is vulnerable because it is . held in place by a small rim of ice, resting on bedrock below sea level . by the coast of the frozen continent. That 'ice plug' might melt away in . coming centuries if ocean waters warm up. 'East Antarctica's Wilkes Basin is like a bottle on a slant. Once uncorked, it empties out,' Matthias Mengel of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, lead author of the study in the journal Nature Climate Change, said in a statement. Co-author Anders Levermann, also at Potsdam in Germany, said the main finding was that the ice flow would be irreversible, if set in motion. But he said there was still time to limit warming to levels to keep the ice plug in place. Almost 200 governments have promised to work out a UN deal by the end of 2015 to curb increasing emissions of man-made greenhouse gases to prevent more droughts, heatwaves, downpours and rising sea levels. Worries about rising seas that could swamp low-lying areas from Shanghai to Florida focus most on ice in Greenland and West Antarctica, as well as far smaller amounts of ice in mountain ranges from the Himalayas to the Andes. Europe: . The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) expects 'multiple stresses and systemic failures due to . climate change' in the Mediterranean. This will increase energy costs . and damage tourism from 2050. North America: . Flooding will be a major threat in this area with rain and storms . moving north of New York. Southern areas are expected to experience a . shortage of water. Asia: . The majority of the people directly affected by sea level rise will be . in southern and eastern Asia. However, water  is also expected to affect . most of Asia. Australasia: . There remains uncertainty about impact in Australasia, but extreme . weather is predicted. The Great Barrier Reef will continue to degrade, . with warmer  water bleaching more coral. Africa: . Food security will be a major issue for Africa. Crops and livestock . will be affected by both flooding and drought. There will also be more . soil erosion from storms. Central and South America: . Scientists expect Northern Brazil may lose 22 per cent of its annual . rainfall by 2100, while the area around Chile could get a 25 per cent . increase. This image, taken by Nasa's Galileo space probe as it flew by Earth on its way to Jupiter in 1996, shows the Wilkes Basin (bottom right) as part of the Ross Ice Shelf. The basin stretches back more than 600 miles (1,000 km) inland and could dramatically raise sea levels if 'ice plugs' holding it back were to melt, says a study . This study is among the first to gauge risks in East Antarctica, the biggest wedge of the continent and usually considered stable. 'I would not be surprised if this (basin) is more vulnerable than West Antarctica,' Levermann said. Antarctica, the size of the United States and Mexico combined, holds enough ice to raise sea levels by some 188 feet (57 metres) if it ever all melted. The study indicated that it could take 200 years or more to melt the ice plugs if ocean temperatures rise. Once removed, it could take between 5,000 and 10,000 years for ice in the Wilkes Basin to empty as gravity pulled the ice seawards. 'It sounds plausible,' Tony Payne, a professor of glaciology at Bristol University who was not involved in the study, said of the findings. The region is not an immediate threat, he said, but 'could contribute metres to sea level rise over thousands of years.' The United Nations panel on climate change says it is at least 95 percent probable that human activities such as burning fossil fuels, rather than natural swings in the climate, are the dominant cause of warming since the 1950s. Sea levels are likely to rise by between 0.85 to 2.7 feet (26 and 82 centimetres) by the late 21st century, after a rise of (0.62 feet) 19 cm since 1900, it says. Antarctica, however, remains the biggest uncertainty in the calculations as to how much sea levels will rise. The Wilkes Basin in East Antarctica, stretching more than 600 miles (1,000 km) inland, has enough ice to raise world sea levels by 10 to 13 feet (three to four metres) if its ice plugs are allowed to melt . If the ice plugs are not sustained, the increase in sea-level rise could become catastrophic .","East Antarctica is more at risk than thought to long-term thaw, says study .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The culinary creations of Neanderthals might be a little basic for our modern tastes, but a new study suggests that they could cook up a warm stew – even if they didn’t have any pots or pans. It has long been known that Neanderthals, who lived around 30,000 years ago, were skilled with fire – and now palaeontologists think they may have invented boil-in-the-bag cuisine. Experts had thought that Homo sapiens were able to thrive, while Neanderthals died, thanks to their ability to heat up food, but new evidence suggests that Neanderthals boiled their food too. Boil-in-the-bag: Palaeontologist John Speth thinks that Neanderthals boiled their food in a bag made of skin or a birch bark tray to soften meat. They are known to have been adept at using fires (illustrated) In January a team of Israeli archaeologists uncovered the site of a large hearth dating to around 300,000 years ago. The discovery of repeated fire building over a continuous period was made in Qesem Cave, an archaeological site near present-day Rosh Ha'ayin in Israel. Historians have long questioned when humans began to control fire in order to use heat to suit their daily needs and the find hints that prehistoric humans had a highly advanced social structures and intellectual capacity. A thick deposit of wood ash in the centre of the cave was discovered and infrared spectroscopy used to find that in the ash were specks of bone and soil that had been heated to very high temperatures – ‘conclusive proof’ of a hearth. The site also contained large numbers of burnt animal bones, which the experts think is further evidence that cave men used fires to cook meat. The findings build upon other evidence that suggests the organisation of various ‘household’ activities into different parts of the cave, points to an organisation of space and a kind of social order that is typical of modern humans. Cooking makes certain nutrients and higher levels of fat available to a digestive system compared to some raw foods. John Speth, an archaeologist at the University of Michigan, told a meeting at the Society for American Archaeology in Austen Texas: ‘I think it’s pretty likely the Neanderthals boiled’. His belief is based upon ancient bones and spears National Geographic reported. Professor Speth thinks that Neanderthals boiled their food in a bag made of skin - likely an animal's paunch - or a bark tray, which would have worked because water will boil at a temperature slightly lower than the one needed to set the material holding it on fire. ‘You can boil in just about anything as long as you take it off the flame pretty quickly,’ he explained. Animal bones found at sites known to have been used by Neanderthals are 90 per cent free of gnawing marks, which suggests that fat had been heated and cooked off. A 2011 study also hints that Neanderthals might have heated grains. However, other academics are not so sure. Mary Stiner of the University of Arizona in Tucson, said she . is 'not convinced' that they went as far as boiling food in bags or on bark. On fire: While evidence of a hearth (marked with arrow) at least 300,000 years old has been found in Israel and is proof that Neanderthals were adept at using fire, most historians agree that the advent of boiling by heating stones and dropping them into water arrived too late for Neanderthals . Neanderthals probably used an animal paunch to make the bags as they only needed to tie off one of the holes and push food inside from one end of the oesophagus, Professor Speth told MailOnline. To make bark cooking containers, they would have simply folded bark into a shape capable of holding a meaty mixture that wouldn't leak. Neanderthals were pretty sophisticated when it came to using tools, which could have been made from wood or other perishable materials, Professor Speth explained. 'Unfortunately what preserves to archaeologists is primarily stone tools which are largely the tools (knives, scrapers, and the like) used to make other tools and equipment, the latter made of perishable materials that we seldom see.' While evidence of a hearth at least 300,000 has been found in Israel and is proof that Neanderthals were adept at using fire, most historians agree that the advent of boiling by heating stones and dropping them into water arrived too late for Neanderthals. The earliest evidence of stones used in this way dates back 26,000 years when Neanderthals were extinct. However, there is evidence that Neanderthals made adhesive for their spears from birch tar around 200,000 years ago, so they had good knowledge of the material. Michael Bisson of Canada’s McGill University told the meeting that making birch tar is complex and requires an oxygen-free vessel, demonstrating that Neanderthals were used to manipulating birch and could have lit cigar-like rolls of bark buried in holes to cook the tar in the correct conditions to prevent it exploding.","University of Michigan Archaeologist thinks Neanderthals boiled food in bags made of skin or a bark trays - but other experts disagree .

"By . Mark Prigg . It could give your fish a new lease of life - and allow them to explore the world outside their aquarium. A team of Dutch researchers has developed a remote control aquarium on wheels that fish can steer themselves, and is set to start selling it. Called fish on wheels, the $200 gadget uses a camera to monitor the direction the fish swims in. Scroll down for Video . The robo-aquarium: The new gadget allows fish to roam free around their home . The prototype version of 'Fish on Wheels' was constructed using a standard webcam, and an Arduino, a tiny comuter, controlled robot vehicle. Using the contrast of the fish with the bottom of the fish tank, its position is determined and used to send commands to the Arduino computer control board to move the car into that direction. 'We came up with the idea of developing the 'Fish on Wheels' device . because we wanted to have something to showcase the possibilities of . computer vision technology,' Thomas de Wolf of Dutch firm Studio Diip told MailOnline. When not driving around, the fish-car can be used as a normal aquarium. 'We then came to the idea that with computer vision even animals would be able to control devices. 'The best way to show this was to enable fish to drive their own aquarium wherever they want to go.' A prototype version of  'Fish on Wheels' was constructed using a standard webcam, a battery powered Beagleboard and an Arduino controlled robot vehicle. Using the contrast of the fish with the bottom of the fish tank, its position is determined and used to send commands to the Arduino computer control board to move the car into that direction. 'Our pet fish have always been limited to their water holding area known as 'the fish tank', the firm said. A camera mounted above the tank allows it to 'watch' the fish to see what direction to drive in . The location of the fish is determined using computer software, which can then 'drive' the car in the direction the fish is swimming in . 'In an attempt to liberate fish all over the world, the first self driving car for fish has been developed. 'Up until now driving vehicles has been limited to mankind only (excluding a handful of autonomous vehicles driven by computers), but now your pet fish can also put the pedal to the metal.' de Wolf said the project was still only at the prototype stage, and is set to be improved before being launched as a Kickstarter project. 'Hopefully this invention will encourage more development in enhanced pet mobility, so pet animals can travel the world more freely.' The team admit they are not sure how much the fish knows about its newfound ability. 'We are still not sure if the fish really has any idea of what it is doing for now,' said de Wolf.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . From the country's enormous riches to its complex religious rituals, there is an enduring fascination with Ancient Egypt. But now a 5,600-year-old tomb has been discovered that could shed light on a time before the First Dynasty of pharoahs. Archaeologists in southern Egypt unearthed a mummy that predates the unification of Egypt, the Egyptian Antiquities Ministry has announced. Treasure trove: Archaeologists in southern Egypt found a mummy that predates the First Dynasty and the unification of Egypt together with an array of precious objects (pictured), the Egyptian Antiquities Ministry announced . The First Dynasty of ancient Egypt covers the first series of pharaohs to rule over a unified Egypt and dates from between 3,100BC and 2890BC. It follows the unification of upper and lower Egypt, which was thought to have come about because of King Narmer. It is one of two early dynasties of the 'archaic period' which was based at Thinis. Little is known about the First Dynasty and most information about the period is based upon a few monuments and objects bearing royal names. The most important artefact of the time if the Narmer Pallette which dates from the 31st century BC and contains some of the earliest hieroglyphic inscriptions ever found. No detailed records of the first two dynasties have survived, except for the terse lists on the Palermo stone. Hieroglyphs were fully developed and their shapes would be used with little change for more than three thousand years. The tomb was built before the rule of King Narmer, the founder of the First Dynasty who unified Upper and Lower Egypt in the 31st century BC, the ministry said in a statement. It was discovered in the Kom al-Ahmar region, between Luxor and Aswan, on the site of Hierakonpolis. This city of the falcon was the dominant pre-dynastic urban centre and the capital of the Kingdom of Upper Egypt. The archaeologists found an ivory statue of a bearded man and the mummy of the tomb's owner, who appeared to have died in his late teenage years, the ministry said. It is thought that the teenager may have been a member of the nobility or even royal because such care was taken with the burial. A number of . other objects were found as well, including knives and combs, one of . which appears to have a hippo standing upon it. The . tomb's preserved state will provide new information on pre-dynastic . rituals, said Renee Friedman, the head of the multinational . archaeological team.

A new scanner can analyse the liquid contents of bottles without opening them and could enable people to carry more liquids again – and get going on their holiday more quickly. Scroll down for video . Robotic mixologist: New scanners (pictured) on trial at 65 airports can analyse the liquid contents of bottles without opening them using laser technology and could enable people to carry more liquids again - and get going on holiday more quickly . The Insight100 uses a laser to determine the chemical composition of liquids in non-metallic containers up to three litres in size without opening them. It uses a technique called Raman Spectroscopy to determine the chemical make-up of a liquid by analysing scattered light and recognising patterns made by different materials. The scanner works by firing a laser into the liquid at different angles. A small proportion of light penetrates the surface of the liquid and bounces back to give the scanner data. It then subtracts data about the container from the overall reading to leave it with a faint signal from the liquid. It cross-checks the remaining information with a library of dangerous liquids. And all this takes just five seconds, which can cut airport queues. A total of 65 airports including Heathrow and Gatwick have bought the scanners by Cobalt Light Systems, which are not much larger than a microwave. The machines use a laser to determine the chemical composition of liquids in non-metallic containers up to three litres in size without opening them, separating harmless ingredients from those like hydrogen peroxide that can be used to make bombs. Since 2006 when there was a plot to blow up trans-Atlantic flights, holiday makers have had to decant liquid essentials into clear bottles holding less than 100ml, leading to extra hassle in airport security queues and a huge amount of waste. Stansted airport fills 20 large bins with confiscated containers every year and Heathrow racks up 2,000 tonnes a year. Bag it up: Since 2006 when there was a plot to blow up trans-Atlantic flights, holiday makers have had to decant liquid essentials into clear bottles holding less than 100mls and stow thin in plastic bags (pictured), leading to extra hassle in airport security queues and a huge amount of waste . Paul loeffen, CEO of Cobalt Light Systems told The Times: 'The aim of airport authorities has always been to get back to the state of normality as it was in 2006. But that meant meeting certain detection standards. ‘The bombs were made from concentrated hydrogen peroxide [which is hard to differentiate from water] and chapatti flour. It’s very scary stuff.' However, the new scanner would have been able to easily tell the difference between water and hydrogen peroxide and it is hoped that it will enable airports to remove the existing hand-luggage liquid ban over the next few years. The Insight100 uses a technique called Raman Spectroscopy to determine the chemical make-up of a liquid by analysing scattered light and recognising patterns made by different materials. The method has been used to identify solid materials for years, but the Oxfordshire-based firm has enabled it to be used to spot differing liquids.

The technology’s reliability and low false alarm rate also significantly reduces the cost associated with delays, missed flights, confiscations and extra personnel required to manage current security processes, according to the Royal Academy of Engineering. The scanner is nominated for the Academy's MacRobert Award, which is the most prestigious and long-running engineering prize in the UK. Experts think the science behind the device could also be used for non-invasive cancer screening, detecting counterfeit goods and food analysis in the future.

They revealed the hapless pair from Dumb and Dumber could have claimed almost £17,500 ($29,484) for the tongue iced to the lamppost incident, while burglars Harry and Marv from Home Alone could have racked up a staggering £190,500 ($320,954) in compensation as the result of their injuries at the hands of Kevin, played by Macaulay Culkin in the 1990 family film.

"By . Gavin Allen . Updated: . 08:57 EST, 16 December 2011 . Labour today comfortably held Feltham and Heston in the by-election with an increased majority over the Conservatives. Labour candidate Seema Malhotra was returned with a majority of 6,203 - a net swing of 8.6 per cent from the Conservatives. On a night which saw a turnout of under 29 per cent - the lowest in a by-election for 11 years - the Liberal Democrats managed to see off a challenge from the UK Independence Party to hold on to third place. Triumph: Labour candidate Seema Malhotra (centre) celebrates with her husband Sushil Saluja (front left) after winning the Feltham and Heston by-election in the early hours of this morning . The result came as a relief to Labour leader Ed Miliband who needed a victory if he was not to face a fresh bout of questioning over his leadership. He hailed the by-election success as a 'verdict on the Government's failed economic plan'. Addressing supporters in Feltham town centre, Mr Miliband called on the Tories to 'listen' to voters. He said: 'I think it is pretty offensive that the Conservatives are saying this morning ""Well, what do you expect? It's a traditional Labour area"". 'They shouldn't be denying the people's choice, they should be listening to the people's verdict. 'I think that is one of the things people really don't like about this government - that they don't listen. They really need to start listening. The triumphant candidate said her victory is a 'wake-up call' for Prime Minister David Cameron. Important message: Ms Malhotra delivers her winning speech as the unsuccessful candidates, Lib Dem Roger Crouch (centre) and Tory Mark Bowen (head bowed), listen on at the Civic Centre in Hounslow, west London . Ms Malhotra said: 'Even on a lower turnout we've increased substantially our majority and the Tories have got to be asking the question of why. 'This is a really important message that's been sent to Mr Cameron.' The Conservatives however said Labour . should have extended their majority even further if they were looking . to be on course for victory at the next general election, set for 2015. The defeated Tory candidate Mark Bowen insisted that he was 'proud' of the result, despite seeing his party's share of the vote fall. 'We have done a lot better than the pollsters and bookmakers suggested we would do,' he said. For the Lib Dems there was relief that they avoided the humiliation of being beaten into fourth place, despite a sharp fall in their share of the vote. Delight: Supporters celebrate Ms Malhotra's victory, which increased Labour's share of the vote from 43per cent at the general election to 54per cent . Lib Dem candidate Roger Crouch said: 'We have shown that we are still resilient and still relevant.' However Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the Lib Dems were 'almost a busted flush'. 'People are turning to Ukip as they realise we are serious when it comes to putting Britain first,' he said. Ukip had been hoping to overhaul the Lib Dems but admitted their chances had been damaged by David Cameron's decision to wield the veto at the Brussels summit, which gave the Tories a fillip in the final week of the campaign. Labour increased their share of the vote from 43per cent at the general election to 54per cent with a net swing of 8.6per cent from the Tories. The Conservative vote share was down from 34per cent to 28per cent, while the Lib Dems dropped from nearly 14per cent to under 6per cent. In contrast, Ukip saw its vote share more than double from 2per cent to over 5per cent. The parliamentary by-election was sparked by the death last month of veteran Labour MP Alan Keen after he lost his battle with cancer.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . The original cast from TLC's hit show Breaking Amish, have returned - all except Katie - to their roots in Pennsylvania and the first episode of the brand new season premieres on Sunday. Fans of the drama-filled first series won't be disappointed if TLC's Return to Amish sneak peak trailer is anything to go by, particularly on the new baby front, as both Rebecca, 20, and Sabrina, 25, are pregnant. Rebecca and Abe's first child, a daughter who, according to many reports, they notoriously conceived before the Breaking Amish cameras started rolling back in 2012 - long before they apparently 'met' for the first time in season one - also seems to make an appearance, having been previously absent from the show. Revealed! In a sneak peek trailer for TLC's spin-off show, Return to Amish, Abe is seen carrying his alleged first child, who wasn't mentioned in the original Breaking Amish show, wife Rebecca . Elsewhere in the trailer, Sabrina is seen experiencing some bizarre food cravings and both she and Rebecca are rushed to hospital on separate occasions. In one clip, the outspoken Sabrina, who was adopted into her Amish family as an infant, says to Mary, the show's matriarch figure: 'You've had a lot of kids. I heard that your ****** gets really floppy.' There also appears to be an emotional fallout from the alleged hook up between Rebecca, who is now adjusting to married life with husband Abe following their return from New York, and his very own brother Andrew. Tensions: Abe (left) and a pregnant Rebecca (right) are settling into married life, with some difficulty, after a period of absence from home while they were exploring New York in the first season of the show, Breaking Amish . Katie, 23, who, in a shock move, has not returned to base camp and is instead in New York perusing a raunchy career as a model, makes only a brief appearance in the trailer, but her presence is certainly felt back home. 'Tell me in a year from now she's not going to be a porn star,' says Jeramiah, pointing to a newspaper advert of his former chum, clad in lacy underwear. 'All we ever do is sit around and bitch about Katie all day and I'm getting tired of it,' argues Sabrina in a separate clip. Expecting: Also pregnant is Sabrina (pictured), who is filmed experiencing some bizarre food cravings and, at one point, seemingly being rushed to hospital . Tensions also appear to be running high when one new cast member busts Andrew for having a cell phone, throwing (and breaking) it in a rage. Self-confessed 'rebel' Jeremiah's love life is also highlighted throughout the series, as is Mary's ongoing struggles with being shunned by the community. And as Andrew is newly released from jail for a 2013 marijuana conviction, he appears to be trying to mend his relationship with his family - a work in progress at best. Racy: Katie (pictured) barely makes an on screen appearance in the trailer, but old chum Jeremiah is seen pointing to this newspaper ad and loudly predicting that she will turn into a 'porn star' as part of her new life in New York . Return to Amish is a spin-off of the original first series of Breaking Amish, which saw the five young Anabaptist adults - four Amish and one Mennonite - leave their sheltered community and experience the bright lights of New York city. At the end of their stay, all the cast members were documented struggling with the decision of whether or not to return to the communities in which they grew up, or brave the modern world alone. The show's second season, Breaking Amish: Brave new world followed an entirely different cast on their trip to Florida, and those characters will not be featured in Return to Amish. Round two: Original series, Breaking Amish, followed (from left), Sabrina, Abe, Rebecca, Jeremiah and Katie, on their travels to New York, all of whom have now returned to Pennsylvania except for Katie . Breaking Amish, which averaged about three million . viewers in its first season, has repeatedly come under fire following revelations which have thrown its 'reality' status into question. While each cast member originally claimed to have grown up in the strict communities, plenty of evidence has surfaced suggesting they all have decidedly dark pasts - involving divorce, children and time away from the faith. And with the exception of Rebecca and Sabrina - who have both been married and divorced before the show begun - every member of the Breaking Amish cast has a police record. The two-hour premiere of Return to Amish begins on Sunday at 9/8c with a holiday reunion.","Cast first appeared on TLC's Breaking Amish, which followed the group of Amish youngsters as they ventured to New York for the first time .

"By . Emma Innes . A British inventor hopes to revolutionise the health industry after producing 3D printed prosthetic limbs. The NHS currently has to pay around £70,000 for a prosthetic hand, but robotics expert Joel Gibbard, 23, has come up with an alternative which could cost just £600. The engineering graduate has created The Dextrus hand, a fully-working prototype built with a 3D printer. Joel Gibbard has invented a fully functional 3D printed prosthetic hand which could be sold for as little as £600 - currently a prosthetic hand costs tens of thousands of pounds . Dextrus works like a human hand, using electric motors instead of muscles and steel cables instead of tendons. The 3D printed plastic parts work like bones and a rubber coating acts as the skin. The hand, which is made from the same material as Lego, can be used without a custom fitting. It can articulate each finger individually enabling it to hold objects of different sizes and shapes. It takes about eight hours to print one off. The Dextrus hand works like a human hand, using electric motors instead of muscles and steel cables instead of tendons . Mr Gibbard, from Bristol, said: ‘The motivation for this was seeing really advanced prosthetics. ‘They’re very expensive so I thought I would create one using my robotics experience and a 3D printer. ‘I want to make it in a way that is cost effective but still profitable. At the moment they would sell for around £1,000 but the idea is to get this down to £600. ‘Money is not my goal with this, I want to make it more accessible for amputees.’ The hand, which is made from the same material as Lego, can be used without a custom fitting and it can articulate each finger individually enabling it to hold objects of different sizes and shapes . It takes about eight hours to print one of the hands. The device is pictured in front of a 3D printer . The hand doesn’t have sensors but detects the amount of resistance on each of the fingers, enabling it to hold an egg without crushing it. Mr Gibbard says it has a ‘firm grip, but not as strong as a human hand’. The hand can crush a paper cup, but not a metal can. Mr Gibbard hopes the hand will be particularly beneficial for children as they are currently often unable to have an expensive prosthetic as they grow out of them every couple of years meaning it is not cost effective. This device is sufficiently cheap that it might allow children to have a new hand every time they grow out of their old one. The scientist graduated with a first class degree in robotics from Plymouth University in 2011. Mr Gibbard said: 'The motivation for this was seeing really advanced prosthetics. They're very expensive so I thought I would create one using my robotics experience and a 3D printer' He then spent two years honing his engineering skills working with National Instruments as an Applications Engineer. But he gave up the job to focus on his robotics hand, moving back in with his parents and ploughing his savings into the ambitious project. Mr Gibbard has got to this stage in just five months and has now raised £39,000 through crowd funding so he can take the invention to the next stage, testing its robustness while working on the electronics and robotics. It is hoped the ‘The Open Hand Project’ will be completed by the end of 2014. The hand doesn't have sensors but detects the amount of resistance on each of the fingers, enabling it to hold an egg without crushing it. Image shows the 3D printer Mr Gibbard used to make the hand . And despite all his hard work, Joel is giving away all of his secrets by making the whole project ‘open source’. This means there are no patents and everything is published online so anyone has the right to use his coding to create and sell prosthetic hands themselves. He said: ‘My passion is robotics and this is a positive outlet. I find it frustrating seeing new technology which is too expensive or not in the public domain. Mr Gibbard has got to this stage in just five months and has now raised £39,000 through crowd funding so he can take the invention to the next stage - testing its robustness while working on the electronics and robotics . ‘I’m giving away the code for this so anyone can use this to build hands and even make money off it themselves. ‘I am not a businessman, I am an inventor and I hope it will be something the NHS might implement themselves. ‘I hope to finish the development in one year and have it on sale in 15 months.’","Joel Gibbard has made a fully-working prototype of The Dextrus hand .

"By . Talal Musa . Published: . 10:46 EST, 25 June 2013 . | . Updated: . 14:58 EST, 25 June 2013 . Rating: . Price: £30 / $46 (RRP) Nobody does the art of war like Company of Heroes. And while this long-awaited sequel isn't quite the masterpiece it could have been, there's still plenty here for strategy fans to enjoy. For a start, Company of Heroes 2 shifts action away from Western Europe and focuses on the desperate battles on the Eastern Front. Conflicts where Soviet troops juggled a war on two fronts - against both Hitler's army and the unrelenting, merciless forces of nature. Frantic: When played on a powerful PC, you'll be treated to visuals that rank amongst the best for the genre . You'll watch your brave troops freeze to death in bitter-cold wind, fall through icy lakes, or be reduced to dust in milliseconds by heavily artillery fire. Company and Heroes 2 sets out to force-feed you a heavy helping of realism, and it largely delivers. It's a shame, then, that the slow-paced 14-mission campaign doesn't make the most of the ColdTech dynamic weather system. When working in tandem with the TrueSight feature - accurately representing your units' visible range, it makes for particularly tense moments. Many campaign levels feel slightly linear, with optional objectives randomly scattered around. It's only until the latter parts of the skirmish that you're given more freedom to build an unstoppable military force. Immersion is not helped by some of the worst cutscenes to grace the PC in recent years. Boasting googly-eyed soldiers and comically bad textures, they're in stark contrast to the game's undeniable beauty when running at maximal settings. Company of Heroes 2 rightly explores dark narratives such as friendly fire and punishment for cowardice, however, given how poorly executed the cutscenes are, the horrific message falls completely flat. Thankfully, away from the narrative is where this game's strengths lie. Along with its dependable multiplayer, the star attraction is the Theatre of War mode. Here you can take part in a number of different scenarios, from fighting battles in harsh environmental conditions to holding off wave after wave of advancing enemy troops. The lack of plot constraints means you can approach each battle how and when you like, without having to wait to try out some of the Soviets' devastating hardware. Relentless: Thanks to the game's Essence Engine 3.0, environments are destructive while character models remain impressive even when zoomed in on the action. Water, in particular, looks superb . Larger scale battles sometimes bring with them their more comical moments. Soldiers move around like a colony of ants - frantically running in circles and randomly going prone. However, most of the skirmishes are as grisly as they are memorable. Company of Heroes 2 was played using an Nvidia GeForce 680 GTX Sli set-up and EVGA Precision X software.

"By . John Hall . This grand Oxfordshire manor was once home to a 10th Century Archbishop of Canterbury, but now contains little more than empty rooms and forgotten memories. Covered in dust and mould, it's hard to imagine Great Tew Manor in its former glory as a home to everyone from Norman aristocrats to key members of the Royalist army during the English Civil War. Built in 990, the forgotten manor house sits in Oxfordshire's picturesque Cotswold Hills, and was photographed by an urban explorer known only as Urbex-SW, who decided to visit Great Tew to explore the grandeur of the house first hand.

Historic: Built in 990, the forgotten manor house sits in Oxfordshire's picturesque Cotswold Hills, and was photographed by an urban explorer known only as Urbex-SW . Religious: The four floor grand manor was originally built for Elfric of Abingdon, who became Archbishop of Canterbury's in 995. Elfric died in 1005, leaving Great Tew to Saint Alban's Abbey who leased it out between 1049 and 1052 . Forgotten: An old copy of The Times newspaper found inside Great Tew Manor shows the date Friday November 7, 1969 . Conquest: Shortly after the Norman invasion of 1066, William the Conqueror granted the manor to his step-brother Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, and it was recorded amongst Odo's estates in the Domesday Book in 1086 . Wreck: Photographer Urbex-SW said he felt quite nervous visiting the manor. The upper floors are falling through, which made walking on them a scary experience . Urbex-SW said: 'I have visited a lot of great places before this, but Great Tew Manor looked very grand. It's not very often locations like this are found.' 'Within the building you can find stunning woodwork dating back hundreds of years... There are newspapers from 1969 and letters dated 1905, along with bundles of old papers, bottles and a stunning spiral staircase,' he added. 'I felt quite nervous visiting the manor. The upper floors within the property were falling through, which made walking on them a very scary experience,' the photographer went on to say.

In 1611 Sir Lawrence Tanfield, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, bought Great Tew estate from local landowner Edward Rainsford. Tanfield . deprived the villagers of timber, causing some of the cottages to fall . into disrepair, and eventually enclosed part of the land in 1622. The . majority of the site was not fully closed to public access until 1767, . however, when parliament passed the Enclosure Act for Great Tew. Urbex-SW said he has visited a lot of great places before this, but Great Tew Manor was particularly grand. He added: 'It's not very often locations like this are found' Intriguing: A letter sent from Lincoln's Inn in London and dated 1905 was found in one of the many rooms at the abandoned Great Tew Manor . Changing hands: In 1611 Sir Lawrence Tanfield, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, bought Great Tew estate from local landowner Edward Rainsford . Shortly after Tanfield died in 1626, Great Tew passed to his son-in-law Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland. In the 1630s Cary gathered the famous 'Great Tew Circle' of writers and scholars, including Abraham Cowley, Ben Jonson and Edmund Waller . The group, who met regularly at the building, would include some of the most important clerics and literary figures of the 17th Century .

Great Tew remained in the Cary family until the death of Anthony Cary, 5th Viscount of Falkland in 1694. In 1780, Great Tew estate was bought by George Stratton who made his fortune through the East India Company. He died in March 1800 and was succeeded by his son George Frederick Stratton, who was the first to let the building fall into disrepair. In 1815–16 Matthew Robinson Boulton bought Great Tew Estate and it remained in the Boulton family until an M.E. Boulton died without heirs in 1914. The Great Tew estate has been owned by the Johnston family since the 1960's. Urbex-SW says: 'For me, the most interesting thing were the old letters, the wood work within the main hall and the different textures throughout the building.. It's not something you see in every derelict building so was certainly interesting.' 'Generally, people are shocked that such a historic manor is sat decaying away in the middle of such a wealthy area such as Oxfordshire,' he added.","Great Tew Manor in Oxfordshire's picturesque Cotswold Hills was built in 990 and abandoned 1,000 years later .

"By . John Hall . This is the dramatic moment an 88-year-old man was rescued after driving his car into a lake while suffering a suspected medical emergency. The man, whose identity has not yet been revealed, remains in intensive care after driving his white Cadillac into the Sinclair Inlet near Bremerton in the U.S. state of Washington. The accident took place shortly after 10am yesterday morning, and saw the man trapped inside his vehicle beneath 10 feet of water, 30 feet from the shore. Saved: The elderly man was rescued by a firefighter, a police officer and two employees of a local boat manufacturer who had been testing new products nearby and witnessed the accident . Bremerton Police Department started receiving reports of a car driving into the water from the south end of Trenton Avenue in the Manette neighborhood at 10.03am yesterday. A police officer and firefighter were the first to arrive at the scene and spotted the vehicle about 30 feet from the shore - suggesting it had been travelling at speed when it entered the water. The men dived into the water and were joined by two employees of SAFE Boats - a local boat manufacturer who were already in the water testing new products when they witnessed the accident. Using an axe he had carried into the water with him, the firefighter was able to break the car's windows and, with the help of the SAFE Boats employees, pull the man to the surface. The group then dragged the elderly man to the shore where a police detective performed CPR and managed to get him breathing. Rescue: The men dived into the water and swam out 30 feet to reach the vehicle. The distance it travelled into the lake is testament to how fast the man must have been driving when he ploughed into the water . Crash: The man, whose identity has not yet been revealed, remains in intensive care after driving his white Cadillac into the Sinclair Inlet near Bremerton in the state of Washington. The vehicle was later recovered . While this was taking place the firefighter and a second police officer swam back to the car to be sure nobody else was trapped. They did not find anyone either in the vehicle or in the surrounding water. Jim and Francoise Deighan were eyewitnesses to the incident and described the scene to the Bremerton Patriot newspaper. 'The car was traveling so fast. I said to my husband, 'He's going too fast. He's not going to be able to stop,' Mrs Deighan said. She added that the vehicle, whose driver appeared not to apply his brakes, then hit a bump in the road and took flight - sailing between a tree and a house before hitting the water. 'I got my phone and called 911... Jim, he ran down to the water to try to help the man,' she said. Treatment: After being rescued the man was taken to Harrison Hospital (pictured) in central Bremerton. He remains in intensive care. The firefighter was also taken to the facility to be treated for cuts . 'It must have been something medical because he didn't try to stop. It was like he wasn't alert, Mrs Deighan added. After being rescued the man was taken to Harrison Medical Center in central Bremerton. He remains at the hospital in intensive care. The firefighter was also taken to the facility to be treated for cuts sustained during the rescue but was discharged later the same day.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Created: . 16:21 EST, 20 April 2014 . Julia Mulligan, the North Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner . Police officers were forced to hire a police car to go on duty – because the crime commissioner had borrowed theirs for a meeting. Julia Mulligan, North Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner, borrowed the car as hers had a flat tyre. But when she didn’t return it the next day, officers had no choice but to hire a replacement just so they could go on their rounds. The commissioner had been given a police ‘pool’ car which officers can book if needed, eventually returning it two days after she had borrowed it. An investigation was launched following a complaint, but Miss Mulligan was cleared of any wrongdoing. The complaints committee which . investigated the matter was told by the commissioner’s office that her . busy schedule meant she could not find time to arrange a repair. Ms Mulligan's office said it was an 'oversight' not to realise the car would not be able to be returned before other officers had booked to use it at 7am the next day. The police and crime panel said the £60.34 cost to hire a car for the officers was less than what Miss Mulligan would have claimed in mileage expenses if she had been using her own car. However, a report explaining the circumstances to the complaints committee conceded that “minor changes” would be made to the way vehicles are used following the incident. The anonymous complaint that sparked the investigation was initially addressed to York Council leader James Alexander who passed it on to the panel. He said: 'The correct place to investigate this anonymous complaint was at the police and crime panel and I was not surprised no further action was deemed necessary. 'Some will be surprised the commissioner was authorised to use the vehicle in question and I understand procedures will be updated in light of this investigation.'","Julia Mulligan, North Yorkshire PCC, borrowed the police car after her own got a flat tire .

"By . Michael Zennie . Yahoo Mail users are furious after the company debuted a major resign of the popular email service that eliminated many features and, some claim, left it looking like a knock off of competitor Gmail. Observers say the 'beautiful' new look of Yahoo Mail is a product of new Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer - and it has backfired. The mail service's 275million users were 'surprised' on October 8 with the redesign and tens of thousands have complained about glitches and reduced functionality. Many simply don't like the look and feel of the new product. 'There is a reason those in this forum use Yahoo and not Gmail. It is based on a difference in thinking how best to design webmail for both the casual and power user,' writes one commenter, who has received more than 27,000 votes on the Yahoo forum for the redesign. Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer has been personally blamed by many for the failings in the new Yahoo Mail redesign . New and improved? Tens of thousands of Yahoo Mail users logged complaints over the redesign of the email interface . The Yahoo Mail users adds: 'This is a major issue that determines the usability of the product.' One writer on the tech site ZD Net has called the redesign a 'disaster' that has left many users questions whether they will keep using Yahoo or flee to other online email services. The biggest complaint has been the elimination of a feature that allows users to open search pages and emails in individual tabs - something that distinguished Yahoo Mail from its biggest competitor, Gmail. One user wrote: 'The only reason I use yahoo is for the tabs. If tabs are gone, then I will be gone.' Another complaint: In their haste to create a streamlined interface for their email service, Yahoo designers somehow forgot to add a 'print' button for users who need paper copies of their emails. 'Now there is no way to print just the email frame! Please fix !!!' demanded one user. Thousands of users say they want the old interface brought back - along with the features that were scrubbed by the update . Look familiar? Many users say the new Yahoo Mail interface is simply a Gmail ripoff . Another Yahoo Mail user responded, saying: 'Someone said 10 lashes to the Yahoo team. I think that is not a sufficient number of lashes.' Users also complained that they can no longer sort their email by sender. One person says: 'That's IMPORTANT functionality. I can't believe that such a feature was overlooked!' Thousands of other users reported major glitches or bugs in the new system - including drafts not saving, emails not being sent properly, text not being formatted properly and errors logging into to the site. The Yahoo forums have logged nearly 5,200 complaints about bugs in the last six days. Many users place the blame squarely on the shoulders of Mayer, who was a top Google executive before she was hired to lead Yahoo in July 2012. 'She is delusional... she has no clue...we ALL HAVE GMAIL ACCOUNTS....that is not why we use yahoo mail....we use yahoo mail because it has TABS,' one user said, referring to Mayer. 'And the fact that she did no research into this like not a single poll or test of this monster before she rolled it out.'","New interface stripped away tabs function that allowed users to open multiple emails in the same window .

But a goal from Team GB's Jonty Clarke began the fightback, and efforts from captain Barry Middleton and James Tindall completed the unlikely recovery. Britain had only won five of their previous 47 meetings with Australia and had not beaten them since the Olympic semi-final in Seoul in 1988 - the last time that a British hockey team took gold.","Ainslie wins to claim gold at his fourth Olympics in a row .

Question of timing: Former Second Lady Lynne Cheney believes that Monica Lewinsky's essay was released now in order to make it 'old news' by the time Hillary Clinton is formally running for president . Her remarks came hours after the magazine released a preview of an upcoming tell-all essay and adjoining collection of photos that the former President's mistress released, breaking her more than decade-long silence on their White House affair. Hillary Clinton has not formally launched . her campaign but she is widely assumed to be the Democratic frontrunner . for the presidency and has been taking part in a speaking tour while . finishing her latest book- both of which serve as signs towards an . expected run. According to Mrs Cheney, who is also promoting her own book, this latest possible hiccup into the scandal seems perfectly timed before it could really inflict too much harm. 'Getting it out of the way so we can say one more time it's old news seems to be like a strategy or a tactic, perhaps,' Mrs Cheney said. Mrs Cheney posed her theory during an . appearance on The O'Reilly Factor, which was being hosted by substitute . Laura Ingraham on Tuesday night. Part of the plan: Cheney argues that what may seem like a problem for Clinton now- the essay- is a way of addressing the cheating scandal in the easiest way possible . Ms . Ingraham loved the theory- saying that she was 'really mad I didn't . think of it first'- but other Republicans are wary of wading too deep . into the Monica-gate issue like they first did during the impeachment . hearings in 1998. The initial scandal coincided with the . midterm elections, and while the GOP focused on their liberal . opponent's moral misgivings, they didn't end up winning back the House. 'This is the same trick the Clintons pulled on us back in ‘98,' conservative strategist Grover Norquist told Buzzfeed. 'We . didn’t campaign against the massive overspending, or anything else. We . were distracted by this bright, shiny object they handed out which was . Monica Lewinsky. 'It will be . the same thing this time: ""Pay no attention to the reset of foreign . policy with Russia, or Libya. Oh look, it’s Hillary the victim!""' 'It’s a constant challenge, but it’s like in baseball: if they throw out a bad pitch and you swing at it, then you’re an idiot.' One Republican who initiated the 'Monicagate' talk even before the Vanity Fair article . was announced was Senator Rand Paul, who called the former President a . 'sexual predator' earlier this year and brought up the affair in the . context of the Democrats' claims that Republican's launched a 'war on . women'. Focus on the past: Republican strategists have cautioned politicians from making too much of the 1998 scandal between then-President Clinton and his former intern because it will not help them at the polls . The full version of Monica Lewinsky's tell-all essay has been released and she accurately predicted how conservative political pundits would read into the timing of her re-emergence. 'Despite what some headlines will . falsely report about this piece, this is not about Me versus the . Clintons. Their lives have moved on; they occupy important and powerful . places on the global stage. I wish them no ill will,' she writes in the . latest issue of Vanity Fair. 'When . I hear of Hillary's prospective candidacy, I cannot help but fear the . next wave of paparazzi, the next wave of 'Where is she now?' stories, . the next reference to me in Fox News's coverage of the primaries. I've . begun to find it debilitating to plot out the cycle of my life, to some . degree, on the political calendar.' As . a counter point to the point she expected conservatives- like Mrs . Cheney- would make, Lewinsky described her decision to write the essay . as a matter of her no longer wanting to put her life on hold. 'Being a conscientious Democrat- and . aware that I could be used as a tool for the left or the right- I have . remained silent for 10 years,' she writes in the Vanity Fair article. She . also notes that the scandal and her ensuing notoriety has had clear . repercussions in her personal life, as her friends have gone off to get . married and have children, while she regularly gets rejected from job . opportunities and decided to flee to England to get her master's in . social psychology at the London School of Economics. Lewinsky . explained that she took great care to cause as few problems for Mrs . Clinton as possible when she first ran for president in 2008, but has . had a change of heart when it comes to this next, expected run. 'I remained virtually reclusive, despite being inundated with press requests,' she said of the 2008 campaign. Coming back out: Monica Lewinsky accurately predicted that her decision to speak out would be interpreted as having a role in the 2016 presidential primaries (pictured in London in 2013) 'I put off announcing several media projects in 2012 until after the election. (They were subsequently canceled—and, no, I wasn’t offered $12million for a salacious tell-all book, contrary to press reports.) 'And recently I’ve found myself gun-shy yet again, fearful of ‘becoming an issue’ should she decide to ramp up her campaign. But should I put my life on hold for another 8 to 10 years?' She revealed that the decade-long silence has come at a cost, as she turned down offers that would've amounted to $10million because she 'didn't feel like the right thing to do'. 'It’s time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress,' she said, poking fun at the infamous '90s attire that she is so closely associated with. 'Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship. Any ‘abuse’ came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position,' she wrote in the essay. 'The Clinton administration, the special prosecutor’s minions, the political operatives on both sides of the aisle, and the media were able to brand me. And that brand stuck, in part because it was imbued with power.' Linda Tripp secretly recorded her colleague, Monica Lewinsky, when she revealed her affair with the President . Linda Tripp: Tripp . worked at the Pentagon and became close with Lewinsky after the then . 23-year-old intern was transferred from the White House in 1996. Lewinsky revealed the sexual affair with Clinton and, on the advice of . Goldberg, Tripp began recording their conversations. She turned those . more than 20 hours of tapes over to Kenneth Starr in exchange for . immunity. She was also the one to convince Lewinsky not to have a blue . dress dry cleaned because it had the President's semen stain on it, . arguing that it was the young intern's 'ultimate protection' if . prosecutors would come after her. Tripp was later charged with illegally . recording Lewinsky but those charges were dripped. She was fired from . her Pentagon job on the last day of the Clinton administration in 2001 . and received a $595,000 payout from the government because she . successfully argued that she was not granted a promotion due to her . involvement in the scandal and other related charges. Her most recent . update came in 2003 during an appearance on Larry King's talk show where . she revealed she had breast cancer. She is last believed to have moved . to Virginia with her German architect husband. Lucianne Goldberg: . Lucianne Golbderg convinced Tripp to record the Lewinsky conversations . The book publisher played a . pivotal role in the Lewinsky scandal by becoming close with Linda Tripp . and advising her to tape her conversations with Lewinsky. Goldberg was . the one who told Tripp that Maryland- where she was based- had one-party . consent laws which would make it legal for Tripp to record Lewinsky . without her knowledge. (That was not actually the case.) she also urged . Tripp to both hand over the tapes to Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr . and to Newsweek reporter Michael Isikoff. Aftr the scandal died down, . she began writing for right-leaning websites and hosting her own radio . show though that is no longer nationally syndicated. Kenneth Starr: . Kenneth Starr was the independent counsel who led the investigation . Appointed as the Independent . Counsel at the start of the Clinton administration in 1994, Starr had a . leading role in the investigations of a number of scandals but the . Lewinsky affair was by far the most infamous. Paula Jones, a former . employee from Arkansas, was suing the President over an alleged sexual . assault when he asked Clinton about his relationship with Lewinsky for . the first time. In that deposition, Clinton denied having 'sexual . relations' with the intern, and Starr then used the semen-stained dress . and hours of surreptitiously obtained Starr recordings to charge the . President with perjury. Starr gained worldwide recognition for his role . in the scandal and shared the Time ‘Man of the Year’ title with Clinton . in 1998. He resigned as independent counsel the next year and went into . academics, first teaching law at NYU and George Mason before being named . the dean of the law school at Pepperdine University in 2004. He went on . to continue work as a lawyer and notably represented Clinton fundraiser . Jeffrey Epstein in his 2007 statutory rape case. He was named the . president of Baylor University in 2010 and continues to hold that . position.","Former Vice President Dick Cheney's wife Lynne said that she thinks the Bill Clinton's mistress' decision to write a tell-all article in Vanity Fair .

"By . Francesca Chambers . Sarah Palin thinks Chelsea Clinton's pregnancy could cause Hillary Clinton to change her mind about abortion. Palin told Extra host Mario Lopez that, 'Just knowing that her daughter Chelsea is pregnant with a baby — it’s a . real baby — it’s not some disposable something,' will perhaps make Hillary reconsider her stance on the issue. The former vice presidential nominee noted that her comment 'will be . controversial, but those who, perhaps, they’re in this position now as a parent or a . grandparent, they realize sanctity of life, how innocent, how precious . it is.' Sarah Palin thinks that Hillary Clinton will 'kind of broaden her world view' when she becomes a grandparent, and potentially 'open her eyes' on the issue of abortion . Palin made the remarks during an interview with Extra's Mario Lopez, after Lopez asked her if Chelsea Clinton's pregnancy would make Hillary Clinton 'more electable' Lopez was in Palin's hometown, Wasilla, Alaska, to interview her about her new Sportsman Channel show Amazing America with Sarah Palin for a segment airing on the channel today. In a teaser of the interview released on Tuesday, Lopez asks Palin if she thinks that Chelsea's pregnancy will make Hillary 'more electable,' as some pundits have suggested. Palin said she that when Hillary becomes a grandparent it will 'broader her world view' on issues such as the national debt and abortion. 'So maybe even on a social issue like . that, she'll open her eyes,' Palin said. Sarah Palin, left, and her mother, right, cooked a moose casserole for Lopez during his trip to Alaska .

"By . John Hall . Accused: Jeffrey Daday, 35, is charged with second-degree grand larceny, a felony offence . A parking attendant has been accused of stealing $89,000 in small change from metres over a five-year period. Jeffrey Daday, a 35-year-old from Brewster in New York state, is charged with second-degree grand larceny, a felony offence, according to prosecutors in Westchester County. District Attorney Janet DiFiore accused Daday of routinely emptying meters around his home town and depositing hundreds of thousands of loose coins at a local bank since early 2009. According to the DA, Daday's spree began on January 5 of that year and continued until his arrest last Tuesday. With tens thousands of pounds going missing of the five-year period, police had been called in to investigate who was behind the scam. They watched Daday's movements over a period of a few days, and were shocked to apparently see the parking attendant emptying meters before visiting a bank to deposit the coins. Last Tuesday the investigators confronted Daday as he left the bank, arresting him on suspicion of depositing the coins into his own personal bank account. He was subsequently released on bail and is expected to appear in court later today. If convicted of grand larceny in the second degree, Daday could face up to 15 years in prison. There is no minimum sentence for the crime for first time offenders in New York state. Parking metres in the Westchester County area take quarters (25 cent coins), dimes (10 cent coins) and nickels (5 cent coins). To amass a total of $89,000, Daday would have had to have taken 356,000 quarters or 890,000 dimes or 1.78 million nickels.

"By . Steve Robson . It's left the Government's top code breakers stumped - but maybe can you decipher the secret message sent by British soldiers during World War Two? The unopened scroll was found attached to the remains of a carrier pigeon at house in Surrey in August. It is believed the bird swooped down on the chimney for a rest during its long journey from Nazi-occupied France.Scroll down for video . Shock: David Martin with the remains of a carrier pigeon which he discovered behind his fireplace . But sadly, the brave 'spy' pigeon then fell off its perch and died with the vital message . still wrapped to its leg. Expert hictorians at GCHQ, who have been trying to decipher the code for weeks unsuccessfully, say it may never be cracked. They are now turning the mystery over to the public in the hope that someone may know the secret to unlock the mystery. The message, hidden in a red cylinder, lay undiscovered in the . chimney for around 70 years until the home’s current owner David Martin decided to restore the fireplace. ‘The chimney was full of twigs and . rubbish,’ he said. ‘We were stunned by how much came out. Then . I started finding bits of a dead pigeon. We thought it might be a . racing pigeon until we spotted the red capsule.’ The former probation officer and his . wife Anne, both 74, unscrewed the capsule and found a hand-written . message inside on a ‘cigarette paper thin’ piece of paper. It was sent to code breakers at . Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire, the intelligence centre where work to . crack the Nazi Enigma code shortened the war by years, and to their . modern-day counterparts at GCHQ in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, who also . tried to decipher it. History: Historians believe the message, (left) which was written by a Sergeant W. Stott, will provide unique insight into the war. It was discovered rolled up in the red capsule attached to the pigeon (right) Complex: The message contains 27 codes, each made up of combinations of five numbers and letters . The bird could have been on its way to wartime decoding HQ Bletchley Park, in Buckinghamshire (pictured). Code-crackers have been frantically trying to decipher the message, which never reached its intended recipient . Carrier pigeons have been used for centuries and were used in both world wars to convey military messages. They can reach speeds of 80mph and distances of 700 miles. The RAF trained 250,000 birds in World War II, forming the National Pigeon Service. The were so relied upon that the government even introduced a special RAF squadron to cull falcons and hawks who attacked them. The birds would be dropped into Nazi occupied Europe using mini parachutes. They were then picked up and secret messages were inserted into capsules on their legs. The birds would then fly hundreds of miles back home. When they landed, wires in the coop would sound a bell or buzzer and a soldier of the Signal Corps would know a message had arrived. He would go to the coop, remove the message from the canister, and send it to its destination by telegraph, field phone, or personal messenger. Thirty two pigeons were even decorated with the Dicken Medal during the war years - the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross. Among them was Commando - a pigeon who carried out more than ninety missions during the war. Another was Kenley Lass who was the first bird to deliver intelligence from an agent in enemy-occupied France in October 1940. Dutch Coast delivered an SOS message from a ditched aircrew 288 miles in 7.5 hours in 1942. Mr Martin said: 'I always understood there was no code that couldn't be cracked. I am beginning to think this message contains highly-sensitive orders.' Experts from UK intelligence agency GCHQ said the message, which has 27 five-letter code groups, is impossible to crack without its codebook. They were also left stumped by missing details, such as the date of the message and the identities of the sender, 'Sjt W Stot', and the recipient, 'X02'. A spokesman said: 'Although it is disappointing that we cannot yet read the message brought back by a brave carrier pigeon, it is a tribute to the skills of the wartime code-makers that, despite working under severe pressure, they devised a code that was indecipherable both then and now.' A GCHQ historian told the BBC help from the public is the best hope for any breakthrough.'There are still quite a lot of people alive who worked in communications centres during the war and who might have some knowledge about this and it would be very interesting if anyone did have information if they could put it in the pot and we could see if we could get any further with it,' he said. Some 250,000 pigeons were deployed in . the Second World War. Able to fly at a mile a minute, they carried . messages from behind enemy lines and, like a forerunner of the ‘black . box’, accompanied RAF bomber crews in case they crashed. Experts say the red capsule Mr Martin . found is the type used by the Special Operations Executive. Their human . agents undertook sabotage missions such as blowing up trains, bridges . and factories in German-occupied territory. The message was written by a Sergeant W . Stott and contains  columns of groups of five letters.  It is thought . that its intended recipient, ‘X02’, is code for Bomber Command. One theory is that the message may . have been requesting a bombing raid somewhere. Another is that the . pigeon was bound for Field Marshal Montgomery’s HQ in Reigate, Surrey, . from where he planned the D-Day landings. Homing pigeons were taken on the D-Day . invasion and released  by Allied Forces to keep generals back on . English shores updated on the operation. Some pigeons were based at Bletchley . Park, which is now a museum. But Colin Hill, curator of its permanent . ‘Pigeons at War’ exhibition, said all of the pigeon  messages in its . archives are in long-hand, not code. ‘The message Mr Martin found must be . highly top secret,’ Mr Hill said. ‘The aluminium ring found on the . bird’s leg tells us it was born  in 1940, and we know it’s an Allied . Forces pigeon because of the red capsule it was carrying, but that’s all . we know.’ En route: Experts believe the pigeon and coded . message may have been flying back from Nazi Germany to General .

The Nine News reporter and younger brother of Karl Stefanovic said the situation was tense after he and his camera crew were stopped by armed men at the edge of Slovyansk, Ukraine. Stefanovic, 30, said they were approaching a checkpoint at the rebel-held town when six to 12 armed separatists ordered them off the road. Scroll down for video . Threatening standoff: Australian reporter Peter Stefanovic was detained by an armed pro-Russian group in Slovyansk, Ukraine overnight . 'A man had a machine gun pointed right at us,' he said during an interview with his brother Karl on the Today Show this morning. 'They told us to get out of the van. They wanted to know who we were, where we came from, what we were doing.' The European correspondent said the high levels of tension in Ukraine made conditions 'very difficult' to report in. 'They went through our bags. They wanted to take our armour, they didn't in the end but they did take some of our protective equipment,' he said. 'They wanted us to delete our pictures as well.' Stefanovic said he and his crew were held for about 40 minutes, before being told to 'get out of town'. 'They were talking to us all the while in Russian and talking to us in a very threatening way – our translator had to relay what was going on,' he said. More than 30 pro-Russian rebels were killed in a military assault in Slovyansk on Monday, amid fresh concerns of civil war. Ukraine Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said on his Facebook page that four government troops also died and another 20 were injured during the clash. Checkpoint: Stefanovic and his camera crew were ordered off the road by armed rebels . High tension: Armed rebels searched their van took some of the crew's protective equipment . Stefanovic said well-equipped and well-armed separatists were expecting a full-on assault by the Ukrainian military. Ukraine is facing its worst crisis in decades as the polarised nation of 46 million tries to decide whether to look toward Europe, as its western regions want to, or improve ties with Russia, which is favoured by the many Russian-speakers in the east. Stefanovic has been filing stories from Ukraine for several weeks. He and his team were the only crew to film as pro-Russian separatists seized a television station Donetsk last week.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A student who found $100,000 in the toilets he was cleaning at the offices of an Australian television headquarters has been allowed to keep most of the cash after a judge rewarded his honesty. Chamindu Amarsinghe was working as a janitor in 2011 at the Nine Network's headquarters in Melbourne's Docklands when he discovered the cash while cleaning the ground floor toilets, the Herald Sun reported. Mr Amarsinghe was unsure at first when he spotted a stash of the distinctive green and yellow Australian $100 and $50 notes in a bin in the bathroom. Windfall: Chamindu Armasinghe found $100,00 in $50 and $100 notes stashed inside a toilet in an office where he was working as a cleaner. His honesty in reporting the cash find to his supervisor has paid off after a court awarded him the bulk of the money . Best policy: After a student working as a cleaner in the Nine Network's Melbourne Dockland headquarters (above) found a large stash of banknotes in the toilet and no-one claimed the money, a judge awarded him $80,000 which investigating police said was a just  reward for Chamindu Armarsinghe's honesty . 'There was too much to count - I thought someone was playing a prank on me,' he said.'But when I touched the notes - all yellow and green - I realised it was real money.' When Mr Amarsinghe reported his find to his supervisor, a plumber was called in and retrieved further notes worth $1200 from the pipes, making a total haul from the toilet worth $100,000. Police were called in, and a man was charged with dealing with the proceeds of crime over the cash, but the charges were dropped. On Thursday, a Melbourne magistrate ruled Mr Amarsinghe could keep $81,597 of the cash he found, with the balance going to the state, magistrate Michael Smith ruled, saying, 'There’s no reason why such honesty should go unrewarded.'Now an IT student studying in New Zealand, Mr Amarsinghe received a phone call this week telling him the cash was his. He told the Herald Sun he was 'speechless' about the windfall. Police approved of the reward. Investigating Detective Senior Constable Daniel Thorne said, 'All the guys in the office felt the same. He’s a struggling student who straight-up didn’t even think of pocketing it.' Mr Amarsinghe, who is about to start a new life back in Australia, said he would give some of the money to help disabled people.'I’m really, really lucky. I’m not going to waste it,' he said.","A student found $100,000 while cleaning toilets in Melbourne .

"By . Dan Bloom . Two young designers have invented a folding boat which flattens into a shoulder bag - and takes its lone captain just two minutes to assemble. Its inventors claim the vessel, which unfurls from a 5ft by 3ft sheet of plastic and is strong enough to hold two adults, could revolutionise the way people enjoy rivers, lakes and canals. It comes with two oars, made from the . remains of the polyethylene plastic sheet which was used to make the . body of the boat together with solid ash wood. Splashing about: This boat is strong enough to hold two people - but unfolds into a flat piece of plastic . Ship on his shoulder: Max Frommeld (pictured) and Arno Mathies believe the boat could become a must-have . Once assembled it transforms into a rigid-hulled boat more than 7ft long and 3ft wide. Designers Max Frommeld and Arno Mathies came up with the idea while studying at London's Royal College of Art and first showed off a prototype three years ago. Mr Mathies, from London, said: 'The idea originated from a curve folding paper workshop we did when studying at the RCA. 'Since that workshop we have developed the idea of curve folding and trying to apply it to a bigger scale and then we decided to make a folding boat. 'The boat is made from a single standard sheet of plastic and it only takes two minutes for one person to assemble it. Simple: The designers tested their creation on the calm waters of London's Regent's Canal . Flat pack: The constituent parts of the boat, most of which were made from a single plastic sheet . Sturdy: The contraption once it is folded into a complete boat. It comes with cushions to make it more comfy . 'It can easily fit two people, but it is definitely more comfortable for one person. 'It is still difficult to provide a precise selling price for our product at this stage, but we hope to make it available as soon as possible.' Mr Mathies said it is easy to explore city centres with the quirky boat because it is so portable. He added: 'The best thing about our boat is the possibility to explore cities in a different manner. 'It is an alternative leisure activity and method for discovering the rich waterways of the city such as Regent’s Canal in London. 'Its portability provides numerous boating activities because it is light and it can easily fit into a car.' The creation is far from the world's first flat-pack boat. Last year keen canoeist and inventor Stuart Woodward from Bath, Somerset, invented the Stakanoo - a canoe which can be assembled from three separate parts in just 60 seconds. And the 2013 Sydney International Boat Show saw the unveiling of the foldable 'Quickboat', whose creators boasted it could also be clicked together in 60 seconds and travel at 20 knots.","Boat weighing just 22kg designed by two graduates of Royal College of Art .

"By . Darren Boyle . Britain is getting happier according to a major international survey commissioned by the Organisation for Economic Development (OECD). More than 60,000 people worldwide have completed a major interactive survey asking about the important things in life and whether they feel happy. According to the results of the Better Life Index, the United Kingdom is the 19th happiest place to live in the world. British people are happier in 2014 than they were in 2013 - but are still only 19th on the OECD's happiness list . In 2013, the United Kingdom rated 6.8 on the OECD and has increased to 6.9 over the past twelve months . According to the OECD report: 'Happiness or subjective well-being can be measured in terms of life satisfaction, the presence of positive experiences and feelings, and the absence of negative experiences and feelings. 'Such measures, while subjective, are a useful complement to objective data to compare the quality of life across countries.'Life satisfaction measures how people evaluate their life as a whole rather than their current feelings. It captures a reflective assessment of which life circumstances and conditions are important for subjective well-being. 'When asked to rate their general satisfaction with life on a scale from 0 to 10, British people gave it a 6.9 grade, slightly higher than the OECD average of 6.6.' According to the OECD survey, British men and women are equally happy, although in Australia, woman are happier than men while it is the opposite in Italy . According to the OECD, British people who have completed university are happier than those who have only received a primary school education. The researchers found that there was no difference between the happiness levels of men and women. The report found that almost three out of four British people experienced more positive experiences in an average day compared with negative experiences. However, the positive experience figure of 74 percent is slightly below the OECD average of 76 percent. German respondents to the survey gave general satisfaction with life a seven on the ten-point scale, ahead of the OECD average of 6.6. In Australia, women at 7.5 are happier than the men who report a 7.2 on the scale which is still above the international average. In Italy, men are happier than women with a score of 6.2 compared to 5.9. According to the OECD report: 'Money, while it cannot buy happiness, is an important means to achieving higher living standards.' The OECD said the average disposable income per person in the UK is £15,253 compared to the international average of £14,137.

"By . Adam Duggan . Two men have been arrested by the Australian Federal Police over an alleged multi-million dollar insider trading scheme. A 26-year-old National Australia Bank officer and a 24-year-old Australian Bureau of Stastics employee allegedly profited themselves $7 million over a nine month period. The men have been charged with offences relating to insider trading, money laundering, corruption and abuse of public office. Cashing-in: An NAB employee worked with an ABS employee to profit $7 million in an insider trading scheme . The arrests came as a result of a joint AFP and Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) operation. The operation commenced after suspicious foreign exchange derivative trading was identified, with the taskforce continuing to monitor up until today. The men were able to profit the $7 million between August 2013 and May 2014. Early on Friday, the AFP and ASIC executed eight search warrants at both of the men's properties and arrested the pair in the process. Included in the items seized was $9,000 in cash. Caught up in corruption: An ABS employee has been charged with has been charged with abuse of public office, releasing sensitive information, receiving a corrupt benefit and insider trading . The 26-year-old Melbourne man, based in Clifton Hill, has been charged with offences relating to corrupting a public official and using inside information to unlawfully profit from positive foreign exchange derivatives. Meanwhile, the 24-year-old Canberra man, based in Belconnen, has been charged with abuse of public office, releasing sensitive information, receiving a corrupt benefit and insider trading. ‘The AFP and ASIC have worked together closely on this serious and complex investigation, utilising the resources and expertise of both agencies to bring about today's arrests,’ AFP Acting National Manager Crime Operations Ian McCartney said. ‘Investigations like this send a clear message to anyone who is thinking of engaging in this type of criminal activity - we have the ability to monitor you and take action, as we've done today.’ Where did the money come from? NAB users will no doubt be concerned, following the arrest of one of the bank's employees in an insider trading sting . 'The outcome of today's operation is a testament to the close working relationship and cooperation between the AFP and ASIC, and the dedication and expertise of the teams involved,' ASIC head of markets enforcement Chris Savundra said. The National Australia Bank and Australian Bureau of Statistics fully cooperated with the investigation. When phoned for comment, a spokesperson for the Australian Federal Police said no further charges would be brought against the pair. The men, who were university friends, are fronting court in Melbourne and Canberra on Friday.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . and Simon Cable Showbusiness Correspondent . Earlier in the day, they had greeted huge crowds outside Buckingham Palace as the country rejoiced at victory in the Second World War. And this is how – according to filmmakers, at least – the young Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret subsequently mingled with the masses as the raucous VE Day celebrations continued into the night. Girls’ Night Out is a fictionalised version of the evening of May 8, 1945, when the future queen and her sister slipped out of the  Palace and joined in with the party spirit. Elizabeth detailed the occasion in her teenage  diaries, recalling the event was ‘great fun’ as she mixed with revellers in the streets. Elizabeth's friend and cousin, the Honourable Margaret Rhodes, claimed many years later in her memoir the group slipped out of the palace to join the nation's carousing. The new film will put what it will claim is flesh on the bones of that extraordinary assertion. However, that flesh is likely to prove highly controversial as it will suggest Princess Margaret danced exuberantly in a Trafalgar Square fountain and the sisters then went on to a club in Liverpool. Trafalgar Square has been transformed for the filming of VE Day production Girl's Night Out (pictured). Hundreds of actors took to the London landmark today to film scenes for the movie - which is a re-imagining of events on May 8 1945 . Revelers smile at the camera as they celebrate the end of the Second World War in Europe. It is thought more than one million people in the UK celebrated on that night - many of whom flocked to Trafalgar Square . A fictional Princess Elizabeth, played by Canadian actress Sarah Gadon grins in glee as she watches over the events taking place at the London landmark . In one fictional scene, Princess Margaret - dressed in fur and her best baby-pink gown - wades through knee-deep water in the Trafalgar Square fountains (pictured) Princess Margaret, played by Bel Powley, lifts up her skirt to make her way round the fountain in the re-imagined VE Day celebrations. The script has not been verified by the Palace - although the book on which is it based is thought to have been approved by the Queen . The fictional Princess Margaret dances in rather raucous celebration - a scene that is certainly not documented in Mrs Rhodes' extraordinary memoir . The . Final Curtsey by Margaret Rhodes was written with the . full knowledge of the Queen - who is said to have read and approved . sections of the text. However, there has been no official corroboration of its account of the VE Day celebrations. The book recounts how, on the night of May 8, the Queen . enjoyed ‘a unique burst of personal freedom; a Cinderella moment in . reverse’. Mrs Rhodes . writes: ‘I can’t remember exactly what we got up to, and so the Queen . has provided me with an aide-memoire taken from her diary entries for . that time.’ The memoir . states young Princess Margaret's diary entry for the following day . reads: 'PM announced unconditional surrender. Sixteen of us went out in . crowd, cheered parents on balcony. Up St J’s St [St James’s Street], . Piccadilly, great fun. 'Out . in crowd again – Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly, Pall Mall, walked simply . miles. Saw parents on balcony at 12.30am – ate, partied, bed 3am!’ It . also says the future Queen wrote in her diary: 'Out in crowd, . Whitehall, Mall, St J St, Piccadilly, Park Lane, Constitution Hill, ran . through Ritz. Walked miles, drank in Dorchester, saw parents twice, . miles away, so many people. Later she wrote: 'Out in crowd . again. Embankment, . Piccadilly. Rained, so fewer people. Congered into house [a reference to . the conga and Buckingham Palace] . . . Sang till 2am. Bed at 3am!’ Actress Sarah Gadon, who plays the young Princess Elizabeth in the film, can be seen enjoying the crowds in a fabulous pink embellished dress .

The filming took place exactly 69 years after the original public holiday . The party continues among the crew of the film, which has an all-star cast and has been filmed in numerous locations across the country . Later in the memoir, Mrs Rhodes, writes: 'A . gang of us, including the two Princesses, were given permission by the . King and Queen to slip away anonymously and join the rejoicing crowds on . the streets. 'There must . have been about 16 of us and we had as escort the King’s Equerry, a . very correct Royal Navy captain in a pinstriped suit, bowler hat and . umbrella. 'Princess . Elizabeth was in uniform, as a subaltern in the Auxiliary Transport . Service – the ATS. She pulled her peaked cap well down over her face to . disguise her much-photographed image. Miraculously she got away with it.' Cast and crew surround the landmark's fountain in a scene which appears to be between takes . Uniformed cast members vigorously wave a selection of British and American flags in one scene . Revelers wade in to the water at the central London landmark  - hitching up their skirts and shorts. The film has already caused controversy as it depicts a young Elizabeth kissing an RAF gunner . The celebrations continue for the cast members - many of whom are wearing hats and waving small Union Jacks. The film is a re-imaging of events, based on a memoir . A fun-loving cast member wrapped in a Union Jack flag with a party hat on her head smiles as she walks through the streets . The new film, Girls Night Out, however, varies from this account somewhat. In . some scenes, the young royals are seen chatting with handsome young men - . before Princess Margaret jumps into the Trafalgar Square fountain. Young . Elizabeth can be seen getting very close to a man in uniform - and is . later shown kissing a dashing young RAF Lancaster gunner. The film stars Rupert Everett . as King George VI, Emily Watson as Queen Elizabeth as well as Sarah Gadon as . Princess Elizabeth and Bel Powley as Margaret. According . to the film an adventurous Margaret, then just 15, slips away from her guards and hops on a bus. Princess . Elizabeth then races around the city in a bid to find her younger sister - finding the gunner, who has no idea who she is, along the way . As she attempts . to find Margaret, she and her companion visit a couple of sleazy Soho nightclubs - and eventually the princess's identity is revealed. Two female characters seem to be having a whale of a time drinking beer and waving their flags while wandering through the crowds on set . Men from the armed forces wave flags and drink from bottles of beer while chatting to young women.

"By . Richard Spillett . British expats in Portugal fear they could lose their holiday villas under a draconian new law which could force them to prove their property was built on private land. A 'water resources law' in the country spread concerns the government could take back any land which was originally owned by the state. Hundreds of retired couples and families with second homes in the country now face an anxious wait to see if their property will be affected. Hundreds of Brits have holiday homes and villas in Medeira (pictured) and other areas of Portugal . The Times reported the new legislation will affect houses close to the sea - meaning thousands of holiday homes built around the country's beaches could be affected. Jersey-born Paul Abiati, 50, who owns a £123,000 seafront house in Madeira, has hit out at the new law, which the Portuguese parliament is now considering amending following a huge outcry. He told the newspaper: 'This is a breach of international and European laws. A citizen, when they buy a private property, has a right to a certainty over it, and peace and enjoyment under fundamental human rights principles.' Another expat, Roger Hardy, said he will struggle to sell his property in the Algarve until the issue is made clearer. Expats in Portugal are facing months of uncertainty over new environmental laws which could affect their holiday homes . Portugal's parliament has recently put forward an amendment, relaxing the laws and potentially saving British homeowners from having to prove the history of their property. But no date has been set for finalising the changes, meaning those living in the country face potentially months of uncertainty. A spokesman for the Portuguese government told the Times the policy was important for the country's environment and not a 'land grab' as has been claimed. He said: 'The law was designed to preserve coastal, river and reservoir areas from over-development. It is within EU law.' Portugal introduced a special, lower tax rate for foreigners two years ago to encourage them in to boost the economy. But many expats are now fleeing southern European countries and selling off their homes as property prices tumble and the region struggles with recession. Recent figures show nearly 90,000 abandoned their Mediterranean dream last year and moved back to Britain.","Law means state can take any home it thinks was built on public land .

"By . Dan Bloom . For a home which costs a shed-load, it won't give you much space. A humble brick and pebbledash garage measuring just 19ft by 10ft has gone on sale in a tiny village in rural Wales - for an eye-watering £38,500. The cost, more than for a one-bed flat 20 miles away, is thought to be one of the highest ever seen in the area. Expensive parking spot: This garage in the Lledr Valley in north Wales costs £38,500 - more than a nearby flat . Humble: The 19ft by 10ft garage has no water, no electricity, no heating and no windows - but a good location . An estate agent said the simple structure in the picturesque Lledr Valley would be ideal for anglers, walkers and campers. Its downsides include that it has no heating, carpets, electricity, running water or even windows. And it comes on a plot measuring 60ft by 30ft, which appears to be uncultivated hardstanding used for little more than parking a car. The description on the estate agent's . website adds: 'No mains services provided but we understand mains . electricity is nearby. Mains water is positioned on a council byway.' Yet the property in Pont-y-Pant, north Wales, is minutes away from spectacular views of the Snowdonia National Park and several popular fishing spots. How it measures up: The specifications of the garage compared to those of a flat 20 miles away in Colwyn Bay . Rural: The garage is near the station for the small valley village of Pont-y-pant (pictured) Set in picturesque woodland, it is also close to a railway station and two miles from the small valley village of Dolwyddelan. At a push, the garage would even fit a small motor home. The prime outhouse costs more than an entire one-bedroom flat in the seaside town of Colwyn Bay, just 20 miles away. There, buyers can get hold of a second-floor flat with central heating, electricity, running water and double-glazing for £37,500. Listed last month at a similar price to several other flats nearby, it also has a separate kitchen, living room, bathroom, bedroom and even a mezzanine office. Comparison: The recent listing for a one-bed flat for just £37,500, £1,000 less than the garage 20 miles away . Peaceful: The garage is located in picturesque woodland and has just about enough space for a caravan . Secluded: The hut is off this country lane in the Snowdonia National Park, popular with ramblers and anglers . But there is one major disadvantage - it has no off-street parking. Average property prices in the Lledr Valley, meanwhile, are also low compared to the high price for a simple brick hut. At £118,602, well below the British average, an ordinary terraced house in nearby Dolwyddelan village is worth only around three times the cost of the shed. An average terraced house in Colwyn Bay costs £108,000. Estate agent Iwan Williams, who is selling the garage, said: 'The price might seem expensive but the Lledr Valley is a very popular fishing area. 'We have had a lot of anglers showing interest in the garage for shelter and parking.'","Simple brick hut measuring 19ft by 10ft is on sale in picturesque Lledr Valley .

"By . Candace Sutton . The police investigation into the street brawl between billionaire James Packer and TV boss David Gyngell is unlikely to go ahead. The case has stalled due to the fact neither Packer nor Gyngell has lodged an official complaint over the incident. NSW Police have said publicly there was no compulsion for either person to be interviewed. James Packer remains in Melbourne after flying out of Sydney after less than a day in which he turned up for work (above) visible bruised and then made an across town dash to meet with rival TV executives to David Gyngell's Nine Network . Unsightly: James Packer was left with a bruised and puffy left eye after his punch-up with TV boss David Gyngell . Acting assistant police commissioner Mark Walton held a press conference reiterating an appeal for anyone with information to come forward, but stressed no decision had been made on whether an offence had been committed. He said whilst police had contacted their legal representatives neither man had been questioned over the incident and heavily watermarked images had made investigation difficult. 'We first became aware of it as it was released in the media,' he said. 'We did review our holdings to see if there was anything we missed. 'In the earlier material it was so difficult to see what was going on because of the branding of it, I certainly wasn’t expecting police to rush out there. 'As the material has become available and the police have started to form a view of what occurred, that is the appropriate time to hold our inquiries.' On a jet plane: Mr Packer was seen boarding his private jet for a flight to Melbourne on Tuesday afternoon . Today as James Packer nursed his black eye in Melbourne, Gyngell was at work at the Nine Network, where he was receiving many messages of support. Yesterday, Gyngell took responsibility for the stoush, releasing  a statement which said had he not turned up at Packer’s premises in an angry mood, then the confrontation would never have occurred,' the statement said. '[Mr Gyngell] fully accepts that he was the instigator of the incident. He respects the job police do and will co-operate fully with their investigation,' the statement said. Packer, 46, and Gyngell, 47, who are childhood friends and were best man at one another's wedding, came to blows in the street outside Packer's luxury beach side apartment on Sunday afternoon. The fight followed a heated text message exchange because Packer believed a camera crew from the network run by Gyngell was trying to catch him with rumoured lover, model Miranda Kerr. Gyngell had gone to the $20million property in Sydney's Bondi Beach to reassure casino owner he was not under surveillance by Nine Network television cameras. The pair immediately became embroiled in a profanity-laced argument which descended into blows. Explosive pictures showed Packer in tracksuit pants and a bearded, bare-foot Gyngell pummeling each other repeatedly and wrestling on the ground before being pulled apart by a bodyguard. Reports of the scuffle say Gyngell, the smaller of the two men, appeared to connect with Packer's eye in a left hook. Following the fight, Packer was seen walking off with his left eye puffy and his grey tracksuit pants marked with grass stains. After emerging the following day with his black eye, Packer reported briefly for work, kept a meeting appointment with Seven Network boss, Kerry Stokes, and then flew to Melbourne on his private jet to escape scrutiny of an intense media scrum which had been tailing him since Monday.","Police investigation into the James Packer street brawl will go no further .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Humans yawn to cool down their brains as it boosts their mental ability, say scientists. How often we yawn is down to the temperature – and 20C (68F) was the optimum amount of heat to provoke the most yawns. A common belief was that yawning helps to increase the oxygen supply but previous research failed to show an association between yawning and blood oxygen levels. A common belief was that yawning helps to increase the oxygen supply but previous research failed to show an association between yawning and blood oxygen levels . The new study revealed sleep cycles, cortical arousal and stress are all associated with fluctuations in brain temperature and yawning subsequently functions to keep the brain temperature balanced and in optimal homeostasis. Researchers looked at how often pedestrians yawned in Austria in the summer and winter – and compared it to yawners in dryer Arizona. They found those in Vienna yawned more in summer than winter – but the opposite was true in Arizona. The researchers said that people tended to yawn more when the temperature hovered around 20C because yawning did nothing to cool the brain when temperatures were warmer than that. U.S. President Barack Obama yawns - obviously needing to boost his mental ability . It's not just American politicians who boost their mental ability: London mayor Boris Johnson adds to his IQ . The research published online in Physiology and Behaviour found yawning had no function when ambient temperatures are as hot as the body – and may not be necessary or may even have harmful consequences when it is freezing outside. The study revealed yawning diminished when temperatures were relatively high at around 37C (98.6F) in the summer of Arizona or low and around freezing in the winter of Vienna. Jorg Massen, a PhD student at Vienna University, said yawning functions to regulate the brain's temperature and in turn improves mental efficiency. The researchers suggest the spreading of this behaviour via contagious yawning could therefore function to enhance overall group vigilance. The young ones: Nothing like boosting some mental ability . Even Roy Jenkins,  Baron Jenkins of Hillhead, Cabinet minister, biographer, co-founder of the SDP needed the occasional mental boost .","Researchers looked at Austrian yawners and compared yawners in Arizona .

Happy 50th birthday in a White House dance party last night. The First Lady turned 50 on Friday, but the big celebration was put on hold until Saturday. The White House revealed nothing about the guest list, but a few guests were caught on camera arriving at the event.

"By . Lucy Crossley . Training a toddler to use the toilet can drive anyone potty – just ask Layton Kennington’s mother. She only left her son alone for a moment, but that was all the 18-month-old needed to jam his training potty so tightly over his head it took four firefighters to free him. Layton’s mother Leanne Urmston, of Bolton, said: ‘I was in the kitchen and he walked in from the lounge with the potty wrapped round his head. Completely potty: Layton Kennington, 18 months, had to be freed by a team of four firefighters after he got his head stuck in his training potty . A woman firefighter cut away the blue seat with a pair of garden shears, while Ms Urmston, 26, distracted her son with some of his favourite toys. The toddler was said to be none the worse for his ordeal. 'I was in the kitchen taking a break for potty training and he walked in from the lounge with the potty itself wrapped round his head,' said mother-of-three Ms Urmston. Rescue mission: Layton's mother Leanne (left) distracted her son with toys while a firefighter cut off the plastic potty using garden shears . 'I just couldn’t get it off, it was so tight below his ears. He started panicking and then I started panicking. 'The potty seat was cutting into his ears.' Ms Urmston said her son was stuck in the potty for around half an hour. 'My friend was over and she told me to call the fire service,' she said. Struggle: Ms Urmston tried to pull the potty away from her son's head, but without success and with Layton starting to panic she called for the emergency services . 'She was in stitches crying with laughter. Layton was getting upset and didn’t understand what was going on. 'He was proper stuck he was screaming, I didn’t know what do. 'A fire engine came quickly with four firefighters. I just wanted the potty seat off Layton’s head - by the end I was more upset than Layton. 'The firefighters were really nice to him. Afterwards we were all laughing but I was in shock for ages. Freed: Ms Urmston with the broken potty after it was cut away from Layton's head . 'Layton likes Fireman Sam but he was that shaken up - he didn’t see the fire engine.' Layton's father Ian Kennington took to Facebook to make fun of the rescue mission, writing: 'Lol, can’t believe you got fire brigade out for that x x.' And a friend of the couple, Nadia Urmston added: 'Lol! that’s one way to potty train.' One of a kind: Firefighters who rescued the toddler said they had never been deployed to free a child from a potty before . Firefighter Neil Mercer, watch manager at Bolton Central Fire Station, said although he had been involved in all manner of bizarre rescue missions, he had never before been tasked to free a child from a potty. 'Layton got the potty stuck on his head and couldn’t get it off. Once we got there he was released from the potty within two to three minutes. 'I have never had anything like this in more than 20 years. 'It is the first potty over the head I have dealt with. Normally kids get their arms or legs stuck behind radiators - but not potties.' Three fire engines were mobilised to rescue a teenage girl who was stuck in a swing in north London . Last month fire crews were called to free Sunny, a nine-year-old golden retriever, who had got her head stuck in a hole in a garden wall as she tried to greet a neighbour’s new puppy on the other side. Her owner Shelley Jones, 22, found her in the garden of her home in Gelding, Nottinghamshire, and after she was unable to free the pet called the fire brigade to the rescue. In December, emergency crews were called to free an owl, who they nicknamed Santa, from a chimney in Wellow, near Bath, Somerset, while crews in Durham rescued four students from Dean of Durham's roof in what was believed to have been a drunken prank gone wrong last November. Three fire engines and at least twelve firefighters were mobilised to rescue a teenage girl who was stuck in a child's swing in Finsbury Park, north London, in September last year. The large contingent of firefighters, who arrived in three separate fire engines, were eventually able to free her after removing the swing from its frame. And toddler Isabelle Preece had to be freed after she got her head stuck in a 50p tractor ride at a garden centre in Donnington, Shropshire. Crews used a bar bending tool - usually reserved for rescuing people trapped in cars - to get her out of the ride. Last summer, London Fire Brigade revealed last year that thanks to the popularity of the erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey, they are increasingly being called out to free people handcuffed to beds. Crews have turned out to 79 such incidents, and urged people 'always keep the keys handy'.

"By . Alex Greig . A man is being called a hero after saving the life of a teenaged girl who fell on the tracks from a crowded New York subway platform during rush hour Wednesday. Joshua Garcia, who works in food service at New York University, was waiting for a train around 6:45pm when he saw Stephanie Xue, 16, begin to sway near the platform edge at Union Square station. Father-of-three Garcia sprang into action when the girl fainted and fell onto the tracks and the people surrounding her made no move to help. Hero dad: Father of three Joshua Garcia saved the life of a young girl who fainted onto New York subway tracks . 'She was . leaning over the platform like she was woozy from medication, and then I . saw her fall and I was like, ""Oh s**t!,""' Garcia told DNA Info. Although . he was about 50 feet from Xue, Garcia pushed through the apathetic . crowd and without hesitating, jumped onto the tracks to rescue the girl, . whose body was lying diagonally across the tracks. Garcia hoisted the petite five-foot four-inch teen above his head. Xue had a deep, six-inch wound across the side of her head. 'You could see her skull,' Garcia told DNA Info. 'It was terrifying to look at.' Even more upsetting, Garcia says, were the reactions of his fellow commuters. Hero dad: Father of three Joshua Garcia saved the life of a young girl who fainted onto New York subway tracks . As he attempted to deposit Xue safely on the platform, he looked up to see that most people on the platform were either taking videos or pictures of the incident with their cell phones. 'It was amazing seeing all these people doing nothing,' he said. 'It was an eye-opener.' Thankfully, one member of the crowd was moved to help. Justine Omilig, 23, a nursing student at Philips Beth Israel, ran over and helped stem the bleed from Xue's head would with a wad of tissues. Together, Garcia and Omilig kept the terrified teenager conscious and talking until an ambulance arrived. Doctors at Bellevue Hospital needed 50 stitches to close the gash on Xue's head. Crowded platform: Out of hundreds waiting at Union Square for the uptown subway, Garcia and Omilig were the only people to help Xue . She can't remember much about the ordeal. 'I remember I started to feel dizzy and I just blacked out, and then I woke up and Joshua was helping support my neck and this woman was applying pressure to my wound,' Xue told DNA Info. She says she is deeply grateful to Garcia for his actions that day when she was in need. 'There is a lot I want to say, but it is hard to find the words,' Xue said. 'I am just so thankful he was there to help me.' For his part, Garcia refused to acknowledge there was anything heroic about his rescue. 'I give all the glory to Lord Jesus,' Garcia told DNA Info. 'I was glad to help and to show her that there are good people out there.'","Stephanie Xue, 16, fainted onto New York subway tracks at Union Square during rush hour Wednesday .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . A 28-year-old man shot and killed three members of a Southern California family before turning the gun on himself, authorities said Friday. The four bodies were found late Thursday inside a home in a residential area of Pomona, police Lt. Michael Keltner said at a morning news conference. The suspect lived at the home, and the murder-suicide appears to have stemmed from a domestic situation, Keltner said. MaryAnn Padilla, 25, her mother Manuela Padilla, 52, and brother Juan, 17, were each killed in their respective bedrooms. MaryAnn Padilla, 25, and brother Juan, 17, were each found shot to death in their respective rooms . Mother Manuela Padilla, 52, was also found killed in what the authorities believe was a murder-suicide . 'This could have happened within 30 seconds easily, from one room to the next to the next,' Keltner told CBS Los Angeles. Also discovered was the body of a suspect known as Raul, 28, who was dating MaryAnn. 'The suspect was found deceased from an apparent self inflicted . gunshot wound and was found in the same room as his girlfriend. A . handgun was recovered near the body of the suspect and is believed to be . the murder weapon,' police said. 'Tough times, she was going to leave him, so maybe that triggered that,' neighbor Leonardo Pina told reporters.

"By . Francesca Chambers . Rumor has it Bill Clinton will finally publicly apologize to former mistress and shamed White House intern Monica Lewinsky for the way the Clinton political operation treated her after their affair a decade and a half ago. For years Lewinsky has contended that that they engaged in a 'consensual relationship' despite being painted by Clinton and his allies as a 'stalker' during the scandal. She maintains in an essay published in Vanity Fair this week that it took two to tango. Clinton may now make nice with Lewinsky more than 15 years later, the Chicago Sun-Times reports, to insulate former First Lady Hillary Clinton from the scandal should she seek the presidency in 2016. Scroll down for video . Rumor has it Bill Clinton will finally apologize to former mistress and shamed White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The two are pictured here during their time together at the White House . Should Bill Clinton apologize for the Monica Lewinsky scandal? In the Vanity Fair essay Lewinsky alleges she 'was made a . scapegoat in order to protect [Bill Clinton's] powerful position.' Lewinsky says she wishes the Clinton's 'no ill will' but wants to get her side of the story out should Hillary run and the affair become a topic of discussion again. Throughout Hillary Clinton's 2008 candidacy, Lewinsky did not comment on the affair - though she says she was approached numerous times - because she did not want to hurt the Democratic Party. This time around, she's speaking out. ‘I turned 40 last year, and it is time to stop tiptoeing around my past — and other people’s futures,’ Lewinsky writes. A man reads Monica Lewinsky's article in Vanity Fair at a news stand in New York. Lewinsky had been silent about her affair with the former president year's before suddenly resurfacing this week . 'I did not have sexual relations with that woman,' then-President Bill Clinton claimed. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton decided to stick with her husband even after truth came out . When the . sex scandal was first reported in the press, Clinton infamously claimed, . 'I did not have sexual relations with that woman.' The world leader's lie lead to an impeachment trial that almost cost him his job. He later admitted he 'misled people, including even my wife. I deeply regret that,' yet he never apologized for his actions. The fallout of the scandal cost Lewinsky her reputation, something she says she was never truly able to rebuild. Faced with the threat that Lewinsky has suddenly surfaced because she is out for revenge, the Sun Times suggests that Bill Clinton might seek to mitigate the havoc Lewinsky could wreak on his wife's political aspirations by apologizing for the pain and suffering his denial of the affair has caused the women throughout the years. The Lewinsky affair has already become 2016 fodder. Kelley Paul, wife to Kentucky Senator and presumed Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul, deplored Bill Clinton's 'predatory, offensive' behavior in an interview with Vogue in January. She indicated that the affair could make Hillary damaged goods. Senator Paul followed his wife's lead and derided Clinton for taking 'advantage of a girl that was 20 years old and an intern in his office.' 'There is no excuse for that and that is predatory behavior and ...  we shouldn’t want to associate with people who would take advantage of a young girl in his office,' Paul said, previewing the first of many sex-scandal related attacks Hillary could hear from Republicans next year. A report suggests Bill Clinton, seen here at Oxford's Christ Church Meadows strolling with Hillary Clinton, may apologize for his past bad acts publicly to reduce the liability his sexual affair with Lewinsky poses to his wife's presumed presidential campaign .","Monica Lewinsky resurfaced this week with an essay in Vanity Fair about affair with Bill Clinton .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Authorities hunting for the driver of a pickup truck that hit and dragged an autistic California man more than 100 feet have released video they hope will help lead to an arrest. Jeff Bell, 24, of Stanton, is shown in the grisly April 23 video being hit, dragged and left for dead in the middle of a busy street as he walked to a nearby bus stop – he is still hospitalized from those injuries.

The mother-of-one said that she will never be able to find closure after her brother was stabbed to death two decades ago. OJ Simpson was acquitted of his murder in 1995. She told Today: 'My brother's gone, and every day I'm reminded of his loss, and I've worked really hard to find a good, healthy balance in my life... For as long as my brother's gone, the loss will be here, and there's no way to find closure in that.' Scroll down for video . Kim Goldman said today that she will never have closure over her brother Ron's death after OJ Simpson was found not guilty of his murder 20 years ago .

Ms Goldman also revealed how she . repeatedly sent letters to Simpson in jail - where he is being held on . separate kidnapping and armed robbery charges - in the hope of setting . up a meeting with a man she only refers to as 'The Killer'. She said: 'I needed to see him small. For so long, he had taken up so much space in my life and in my head. I needed to diminish him in size and see him in shackles and see him in an orange jumpsuit and have me be the one to finally walk away and let him watch me walk out the door.' The 43-year-old appeared on the Today show on Friday to promote her new book, Can’t Forgive: My Twenty-Year Battle with O.J. Simpson. She described the book as a way to reclaim her voice after so many years known as the sister of murder victim Ron Goldman. She also made the shocking revelation that she almost killed OJ Simpson in revenge after seeing him by chance in a strip mall parking lot a year after he was found not guilty. In an article published in the National Enquirer this week, she said: 'In 1996, (Simpson) walked in front of me while I was driving my car. 'I thought ''I can kill him, right here, right now.'' I never thought ''avenger'' and ''assassin'' were words to describe me, but in that moment they were.'

Nicole Brown, 35, was stabbed to death outside her Los Angeles home 20 . years ago along with friend Ronald Goldman who was visiting her . Kim Goldman has released a book about her brother Ron's murder 20 years on . The 43-year-old mother-of-one, who . lives in Valencia, Caifornia, is the director of the nonprofit SCV Youth . Project, which provides counseling and support for young people. Her e-book on the murder of her brother, Ronald was published on Tuesday and chronicles her decades-long legal pursuit of Simpson. In the book, Ms Goldman admits that she dreams about torturing Simpson. Simpon's ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, a waiter, were stabbed to death outside her Brentwood home on June 12, 1994. In . the days following the murders, the net began to close on Simpson, . considered the prime suspect, after it emerged that his wife has . suffered mental and physical abuse at his hands for years. On June 17, the day that Simpson was supposed to turn himself over to police on murder charges, the . former football player led officers on an infamous low-speed pursuit . in a white Ford Bronco SUV in California. Simpson finally surrendered to police and was jailed awaiting trial. The internationally publicized trial of . O.J. Simpson lasted one year and was dubbed the 'trial of the century'. Ms Goldman writes in her memoir how she attended every day of Simpson's murder trial and the stress almost drove her to suicide. She said that only the thought of her father Fred, struggling with the weight of his own grief, pulled her back from the brink. In 1995, Simpson was acquitted of the 1994 murders of his ex-wife and Mr . Goldman. The 43-year-old said that watching Simpson go free left her feeling furious and betrayed. Ms Goldman, who at the time was dating First Lady Hillary Clinton's make-up artist, said that her boyfriend conveyed messages of support from the White House. She wrote in her book that Mrs Clinton passed messages of sympathy to her family and that when the Goldmans went to meet President Clinton, he said that was proud of how they had conducted themselves throughout the trial. Following the criminal trial, the Goldman and Brown families pursued Simpson in civil court for $33.5million in damages and won. The families have only see around 1 per cent of the money - but Ms Goldman says she will never stop trying to get the award from Simpson, not because they want to be rich but because she wants to leave him destitute.

"By . Meghan Keneally . One of Monica Lewinsky's former fellow interns has defended her right to speak out again about her affair with President Clinton. 'I do feel bad for her because she was young. I don’t blame her for coming forward now and saying, ""I was tormented. I was bullied,""' Nicole Maffeo Russo said. Ms Russo was one year older than Lewinsky, who she called 'the portly pepperpot' in an interview with The Boston Herald, and spoke with her frequently when they were both part of the intern program. Scroll down for video . Former coworkers: Nicole Maffeo Russo (right) worked with Monica Lewinsky (pictured left in 2011) through the White House internship program and she said she heard rumors about the affair when it was happening . The 1998 sex scandal has come back into the spotlight as Lewinsky, now 40, has broken her decades-long silence and told her side of the story to Vanity Fair. 'Some of my former colleagues are like, ""Do we really have to go through this again?"" But at this point it’s like 20 years later, haven’t we all been curious about what she’s been up to?' Ms Russo said. This isn't the first time that Ms Russo has spoke about the affair, as she was one of the first people to speculate about it when it was actually happening. 'I told everyone I knew about the rumors. I told my mother. I told my college roommates. I told people in bars... That’s probably how I wound up in front of the grand jury,' she told The Herald. Back in the spotlight: Lewinsky penned a tell-all article about her life after the scandal for this month's Vanity Fair . At the time, she 'was pissed' that she got flown to Washington for the hearing because she felt shew as being asked to 'spread my gossip to the grand jury'. Since then, Ms Russo has moved to Boston and works as a restaurant and hospitality public relations specialist. The anger about the scandal and ensuing investigation has died down but curiosity about her former friend remains. One of the regrets she holds on to, however, is that the prestige of a White House internship has been forever dampened. Office gossip: Unlike Linda Tripp who met Monica Lewinsky after she was transferred to the Pentagon, Ms Russo worked with her in the White House . Moving on: Ms Russo now lives in Boston and works as a public relations specialist for restaurants and hospitality . Ms Russo's musings come after Lewinsky wrote the tell-all article as a way to re-enter public life after staying 'virtually reclusive' during Hillary Clinton's first presidential run in 2008. 'I put off announcing several media projects in 2012 until after the election. (They were subsequently canceled—and, no, I wasn’t offered $12million for a salacious tell-all book, contrary to press reports,) ' Lewinsky wrote in the Vanity Fair article. 'And recently I’ve found myself gun-shy yet again, fearful of ‘becoming an issue’ should she decide to ramp up her campaign. But should I put my life on hold for another 8 to 10 years? 'It’s time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress.'","Nicole Maffeo Russo worked with Monica Lewinsky at the White House and heard rumblings about the affair before it was officially discovered .

"By . John Hall . Garden-visiting squirrels have been transformed into heroes of the animal kingdom after being unwittingly coaxed into human-like poses. From popping a champagne cork to appearing to take part in magic tricks, the wild squirrels captured in these images are gently coaxed into their eccentric positions using a variety of toys and food treats. Photographer Max Ellis, 51, says it takes hours - and occasionally days - to set up each shot, as he has to wait for his subjects to take up the exact stance in his garden in Teddington, south west London before he is able to capture his image. Heavy lifting: This squirrel appears to be pumping iron, but is actually gathering sunflower seeds that have been strategically placed on a dumbbell suspended in the air using a fishing line. Photographer Max Ellis says it takes hours - and occasionally days - to set up each shot, as he has to wait for his subjects to take the right stance . Ouch!

Mr Ellis, said the fact squirrels are really intelligent is both the biggest plus and minus to working with them . In one scene an inquisitive squirrel is sent flying through the air in fear by a game of Buckaroo, while in another it appears to be lifting weights. Mr Ellis, who uses sunflower seeds, cookies and toys to lure the curious creatures into position, said: 'The fact they’re really intelligent is both the biggest plus and minus to working with them. 'They usually very quickly work out ways to get to the treats I leave for them but sometimes it takes a while as they’re wild animals so I need a lot of patience,' he added. 'I’m experimenting with more elaborate props and new ideas come to me daily. They constantly surprise me with their intelligence and dexterity so its great fun coming up with new ideas.

Although he doesn't know it yet, the squirrel is in for quite a surprise . Fear: As the Buckaroo toy started to kick, the terrified squirrel jumped from the table to get away as quickly as it could. Mr Ellis said he uses very little retouching in the shots and the squirrels have never been harmed. 'They are probably better fed than any other wild squirrels on the planet,' he claimed .

'I used some see-through wire so it looked extra natural and then it was just a matter of time waiting for one to get into the perfect position,' he added. Mr Ellis said he uses very little retouching in the shots and the squirrels have never been harmed. 'They are probably better fed than any other wild squirrels on the planet,' he claimed.","Photographer Max Ellis, 51, spends hours working to ensure the wild squirrels take up their hilarious stances .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Construction work is being blamed for the collapse of this Chinese petrol station which sank into a giant hole. It is thought that building site workers weakened the ground around the filling station in Hangzhou city in Zhejiang province causing a big crack to appear down the front of the building. Pump attendant Tao Ku was on duty when the earth began to shift and the 50,000 ton steel and concrete station began to be consumed by the earth. The petrol station in Hangzhou city in Zhejiang province, which sank into a giant hole in the ground . Nearby construction work is being blamed for the collapse of the filling station . The 25-year-old said: ‘I was filling up the tank of a Lexus when I suddenly felt this ominous shaking and juddering, just as if there was an earthquake. ‘Suddenly the pump motor cut out and I looked up to see a gigantic crack appear down the front of the building. ‘Then the lights began to flicker and there was a perceptible tilt to the forecourt.  “Get away, get away, we are sinking” shouted my boss. ‘I told the Lexus driver to beat it and I ran for my life.’ China’s push for urbanisation has caused several man-made disasters, with construction sites often unsafe for both workers and people living near them. Sinking buildings are a common occurrence across China as the country pushes for urbanisation . The pump attendant added: ‘There has been so much construction in this area the place underground is riddled like a honeycomb. ‘One set of workers in one building has no clue what their counterparts just yards away are doing. ‘They dig ancillary road and sewage tunnels, tunnels for electric cabling and pipes, caverns for underground car parks and then they wonder why buildings above don't stay put!’ Building workers come to see what has happened to the petrol station which sank into the ground . A town planning spokesman said they would be an investigation into what caused the station to collapse . All fuel had to be pumped out of the station and into tankers before being moved to giant tanks 10 miles away. A wrecking ball then arrived to demolish what remained of the submerged building. A town planning spokesman said: ‘We are launching an investigation into what made the petrol station disappear into the bowels of the earth.’","Earth began to shift at filling station in Hangzhou city in Zhejiang province .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A California fire chief, wanted for the murder of his 26-year-old girlfriend, may have used an escort service to help him escape. Orville 'Moe' Fleming has been on the run since Sarah June Douglas was found stabbed and strangled in their Sacramento home on May 1. The 55-year-old may have used from the same escort service he met Miss Douglas through to get help to escape, investigators say. Scroll down for video . Victim: Sarah June Douglas was found stabbed and strangled in the home she shared with Orville Fleming, who she met on an escort site . Police believe that Fleming, who had been dating Miss Douglas for two years, had continued to use the escort website after her death. It is though that he picked up someone he had met on the site just moments after Miss Douglas was stabbed, before fleeing. 'We have information . that [Fleming] has most likely reached out to someone in the community . of [Redbook],' Sergeant Lisa Bowman told CBS. 'If he can commit such a heinous and violent murder in the way that he did, we're concerned for the public.' A state-wide manhunt is underway to find Fleming, who is suspected of murder after the victim's sister identified his voice during an argument she heard during a call to Miss Douglas on the night she died. Miss Douglas had confided in her mom and sister that her relationship with Fleming was troubled on the night she was murdered. Manhunt: Police are looking for Orville Fleming, who is suspected of killing Sarah Douglas . Attacked: Sarah Douglas had confided in her sister that she planned to end her relationship with Fleming just hours before she was killed . The former escort called her sister, Stephainie, just after midnight on May 1 to say: 'That [SOB] left the gas on. I think he's trying to kill my birds.' She was then heard saying: 'Whoa, you scared me' before a man the sister later identified as Fleming was heard arguing with her. Stephanie Douglas said she then heard her sister scream, before the line went dead. Police believe Miss Douglas had met Fleming through an escort agency she worked at two years ago. Her profile on the site she used to work for listed her rates as $300 an hour and said she would meet clients around the Sacramento and Bakersfield areas, the Sacramento Bee reported. Fleming's estranged wife, Meagan, has claimed that Miss Douglas had demanded that she pay off her husband's debts for her escort services. Wanted: Fleming is the primary suspect in the stabbing death of Sarah Douglas . Veteran: The lone suspect is a 24-year veteran firefighter that has risen to the rank of battalion chief . Ms Fleming told KXTV the young woman had demanded $1,500 and claimed to have a sex tape of her husband. 'She . said to me and my daughter, if your husband doesn't pay, your husband . will go to jail, and I have a sex tape with him,' Ms Fleming said. In November, Ms Fleming had a restraining order made against Miss Douglas. The former escort had been living with Fleming in the Sacramento home where her body was discovered on May 1. Grieving: Loved ones gathered in front of the suburban Sacramento home . Sad days: A memorial in front of the home Douglas once shared with Fleming . Her . sister had dropped round that morning after becoming concerned when she . couldn't reach Miss Douglas after hearing the argument over the phone . the night before. When police entered the home at about 9am that day, they found blood in the laundry room and a bloody towel in the bathroom. When . they entered the master bedroom, they found Miss Douglas face down on . the floor, with a sheet wrapped around her neck. Blood was spattered . across the walls and floor.

Help: Fleming allegedly reached out to an escort service shortly after the murder of his girlfriend . 'This has nothing to do with the . allegations or the potential criminal charges. It is simply because he . has not shown up for work for five consecutive work days,' Cal Fire spokesman Daniel Berlant, said. 'Like any . employee who does not show up, they are separated from the state.' A state-wide manhunt is in force to try to find Fleming, who authorities have warned could be armed with two pistols.

"By . Matt Barlow . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . and Tom Bellwood . Follow @@TomBellwood . John Stones will be given a shock call-up to England’s World Cup squad if injury shatters Phil Jones’s dream of going to Brazil. The Everton defender made his Barclays Premier League debut only last September and has not figured in any of the squads Roy Hodgson has named this season. But he has starred for the Under 21s and Sportsmail understands that Hodgson will turn to the 19-year-old if Jones is ruled out. Only 18 months ago, Stones was playing for his hometown club Barnsley before moving to Everton for £2million. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Stones score against Juventus and Hodgson on England . Fast track: John Stones (C) will get a World Cup call-up if Phil Jones fails to recover from injury . Teenage kicks: The 19-year-old has been impressive at Everton since his £3million move from Barnsley . Jones was forced off early during Manchester United’s 3-1 win over Hull on Tuesday with a serious shoulder problem. His club have yet to release an official bulletin on the damage but it was initially suspected to be a dislocation. United caretaker manager Ryan Giggs said after the game ‘it didn’t look good’. Hodgson, who will unveil his  23-man party on Monday, watched Stones in action at Goodison Park last weekend when Everton were beaten 3-2 by Manchester City. Former England striker Gary Lineker has urged Hodgson to take the gamble on Stones. ‘I really like him,’ said Lineker. ‘He has got a lot about him. Sometimes central defenders need a bit more experience because of the extra discipline and nature of that role. But is he worth a gamble? Well, if Jones doesn’t make it — what else have we got?’ Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has admitted the next few days will determine if Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will be fit for the World Cup. That's torn it! Phil Jones (C) is waiting on results after appearing to dislocate his shoulder against Hull . Oxlade-Chamberlain returned to Arsenal . training yesterday and came through unscathed, but he is still troubled . by a groin problem. Wenger is not counting on him for the FA Cup final on Saturday week and admits he will have to rule the 20-year-old midfielder out of Brazil if the problem flares up. ‘His time is getting short now but I am still convinced he can do it if he gets over the next hurdle,’ said Wenger. ‘It is inflamed. I don’t believe he will need surgery. We will stop him before that. If he gets over the next three or four days and he has no pain, he will be available for Brazil. If he doesn’t, it becomes more doubtful. Sweating: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain faces a nervous wait  to find out if he'll be fit for Brazil . Will they, won't they? North London rivals Jack Wilshere (L) and Kyle Walker (R) are England's other doubts . ‘He is desperate to go but we are in a job where your body responds or it doesn’t. He can only go to the World Cup if he is completely fit. It wouldn’t be helpful for England for him to go there and not be 100 per cent.’ It would be a huge blow for Hodgson, who has already lost wingers Theo Walcott, Andros Townsend and Jay Rodriguez to injuries. Hodgson has other concerns. Jack Wilshere, out with an ankle injury since March, is expected to return to the Arsenal squad for Sunday’s game at Norwich, but is not certain to start. And Spurs right back Kyle Walker, who has been out for two months with a groin injury, is not likely to feature in their final game of the season. Unleash the cubs! Glenn Hoddle (C) has urged England to go with youth after taking Michael Owen (L) and David Beckham (R) to the 1998 World Cup . Meanwhile, former England manager Glenn Hoddle has backed Sportsmail’s campaign calling for Hodgson to unleash the young Lions. Hoddle, who was speaking at a World Cup event for Continental Tyres, said: ‘We have seen some electrifying prospects over the years. I was very fortunate to have a young Michael Owen, Rio Ferdinand, Paul Scholes and David Beckham. They were four fantastic players. ‘Did they know everything then? No. Were they as good then as they eventually became? No. They grew and gained experience. ‘Sterling, Lallana and Shaw will be so much better for the experience of going to the World Cup.’","Everton defender John Stones will get a World Cup call up if Phil Jones fails to recover from injury .

When the teens began bullying his family members, Mr Price asked them to stop. Minutes later, he approached by two men. They violently attacked the young father before knocking him to the ground -  kicking and punching him. Josh Price, pictured with daughter Lacey and partner Kirsty, was approached by two men in a park in Ossett, West Yorkshire, after he asked two teenage girls to 'play nice' with his young niece and nephew . Mr Price suffered a blood clot on his brain and was put in to a medically induced coma at Leeds General Infirmary. He also had a stroke and is currently paralysed down his right side. The father has been moved from intensive care . into a high dependency unit - but doctors have warned that there is . scarring on his brain and another blood clot could form at any time. Medics have told his partner Kirsty Berry, 22, and the rest of his family they do not know how severe Mr Price's long-term injuries will be.

Mr Price's father Stuart, 43, said the attack took place after his son asked two girls to 'play nice' with his young family members. The lorry driver said: 'As a parent you never want to see your child like that. We are all numb and in total shock. We’re barely functioning as a family. The father of two, pictured with his daughter and partner, tried to run away from the men - who punched and kicked him. His attackers even assaulted two bystanders who attempted to defend the man . 'It was the worst phone call I could have imagined to receive. I got the first flight back from Spain and when I got to Leeds General Infirmary (LGI) on Sunday, Josh had been put into a coma. 'I was told that he had been at the park and two older girls were bullying his niece, so Josh went over and said ""play nice"". 'About ten or 15 minutes later this van pulls up and two guys get out and come  towards Josh. 'They gave him a vicious beating, but at some point he managed to get up and ran towards the nearby rugby clubhouse, where they followed him. 'They even assaulted some of the other people there who tried to stop them getting at Josh. 'People at the clubhouse were saying that Josh looked dazed, so we think he might have been concussed at that point. 'But when Josh left the rugby club, they went for him again, blindsided him, punched him to the ground and kicked his head while he was on the ground. Then they ran off.' Mr Price's father said an ambulance was called and he was taken to hospital where he underwent three-hour surgery to remove a blood clot on his brain. Trinity park in Ossett where the violent attack took place. The father, a builder and rugby player, is now recovering in hospital after suffering a stroke and a blood clot to the brain . When he came out, he was in a medically-induced coma which he was gradually brought out of on Monday, and he was moved from intensive care to a high-dependency unit. He added: 'He’s in and out of consciousness at the moment. His eyes are open sometimes but he can’t speak properly, he’s mumbling. 'He’s suffered a stroke at some point, which has caused him to be paralysed down his right-hand side and doctors said they can’t tell us if this will be permanent, because it all depends on how Josh’s recovery goes. 'He’s got severe memory loss, when we mention his daughter Lacey, he doesn’t know who we’re talking about, but when you show him a picture, he remembers her.

Murphy has a habit of eating everything he can find from socks to skirting boards. So when mother-of-two Donnah Dear left cash for a four-day holiday to Torremolinos on the kitchen counter, he couldn't resist. Shock: Donnah Dear, 37, and her sons Oliver, three, and Toby, six, with Murphy who ate £400 of their cash . It wasn't until she and partner Ben Lawson, 36, came home to pack that they discovered what had happened. Ms Dear, 37, said: 'It just disappeared. There wasn't a trace of it, not a corner of a note or anything. 'We spent ages looking before we realised Murphy must have eaten it.' Determined to go on the holiday with their sons Toby, six, and Oliver, three, they left the puppy at home in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, with Mr Lawson's mother Jill. Incredibly, by the time they returned £375 of the cash had emerged intact - and Barclays agreed to put the chewed-up cash back in their account. Despite emergency surgery since, to recover an eaten sock, the remaining £25 has not been found. The family had been planning to spend the money they saved during a four-day trip to Torremolinos . Ms Dear added: 'We thought 'oh no we are going on holiday with no money, that's really bad' - but it was okay, it didn't ruin our trip. 'We managed to get enough money together so it was alright. 'As we queued to get on the plane we heard that Jill had got about £300 back, by the time we returned it was £375. 'The last £25 has disappeared. 'We took the money to Barclays and although the notes had been chewed up and stuck back together they put the money in our account, which was really good of them.' Despite recovering the money, Ms Dear, who runs an estate agents with Mr Lawson, said: 'Murphy will be our first and last dog.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Jeremy Clarkson was saved from losing his job over allegedly saying the N-word by the BBC Director General, reports claim. Tony Hall overruled director of television Danny Cohen, who allegedly wanted to sack the Top Gear presenter. Despite mass outrage, Hall handed Clarkson, 54, a 'final warning' after a lengthy meeting to settle the scandal. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Saved: Jeremy Clarkson avoided being sacked thanks to Tony Hall (right) who 'overruled top BBC executives' Mr Clarkson, shown filming for Top Gear, when it is alleged he used the n-word - a claim he denies . Cohen, renowned for promoting diversity within the corporation, had also pushed for suspension but Hall vetoed, according to The Guardian. The controversial decision will save the BBC millions by keeping hit show Top Gear, which earns in excess of £150million a year in revenue. Clarkson became embroiled in controversy after . unaired footage of him using the nursery rhyme to compare two sports . cars was leaked to the media. Historically . the rhyme was 'Eeny meeny miny mo, catch a n***** by his toe', and . Clarkson said he 'mumbled' in two takes to avoid using the racist term - . which made it sound like he was saying it. In the third, which was broadcast, he said the word 'teacher' instead. Danny Cohen, the BBC's director of television, allegedly called for Clarkson to be sacked or suspended . It came just weeks after he referred to an Asian man as a 'slope' during an episode of Top Gear. The star 'begged for forgiveness' after admitting he was 'mortified' at the footage which emerged. An online petition calling for the BBC presenter to be sacked has reached more than 1,000 signatures. Labour figures including deputy leader Harriet Harman also demanded he should be sacked. 'Anybody who uses the N-word in public or private in whatever context has no place in the British Broadcasting Corporation,' she wrote on Twitter. And Labour MP Chris Bryant wrote: 'Clarkson announces he has one last chance. He's been in that saloon so long now he must be hammered.' But Education Secretary Michael Gove urged the BBC not to axe Clarkson because he had been 'clear in his apology'. And the Prime Minister appeared to agree. Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: 'He does share the Education Secretary's view: it is absolutely right that there has been an apology.' Pressed on whether he also shared the view he should keep his job, he replied: 'His view is that in terms of actions and the like, that's for the BBC.' However, Clarkson has since declared the corporation had forced him to apologise when he did not want to. He said he will be . sacked if he ever makes an offensive remark again, admitting 'not even the angel Gabriel' could survive after the threat - especially not a presenter renowned for controversy. But the presenter compared his apology to saying sorry for starting the Syrian civil war because they were both things he had not done. A solemn-looking Jeremy Clarkson said the item was recorded a 'couple of years ago' and said he 'did everything in my power to make sure that that version did not appear in the programme that was transmitted' The decision will save the BBC millions as Top Gear earns in excess of £150million in revenue a year . 'I've been told by the BBC that if I make one more offensive remark, anywhere, at any time, I will be sacked,' he wrote. 'And even the angel Gabriel would struggle to survive with that hanging over his head. 'It's inevitable that one day, someone, somewhere will say that I've offended them, and that will be that.' He also wrote: 'Happily, the BBC had a plan. Unfortunately, it wasn't a very good one. 'An apology is a good idea if you've just spilled some beer down someone's shirt...But saying sorry for using the most racist word of them all, and hoping the story would die down as a result?' The pressure to apologise even went against the advice of his own lawyer, he claimed.","Clarkson had 'disciplinary meeting' with Hall and TV director Danny Cohen .

"By . Ian Drury . Ruling: A pregnant schoolgirl was yesterday given the right to choose whether to have an abortion by a High Court judge (picture posed by model) A pregnant schoolgirl was yesterday given the right to choose whether to have an abortion by a High Court judge. Even though the mother-to-be is just 13, Mr Justice Mostyn ruled that she was capable of making up her own mind as to whether or not to keep the child. The teenager, who lives with her parents, only realised she was pregnant when her grandmother spotted her growing bump and took her for medical tests. The schoolgirl – who can be identified only as ‘A’ – is believed to have thought she had been gaining a little weight for other reasons. A scan at a local hospital confirmed she was pregnant but the devastated girl said she was not ready to start a family at such a young age and wanted to have a termination. The girl was 21 weeks pregnant when the case went before the High Court as an emergency hearing in mid-March. The local authority, which is in the North of England, was forced to seek a declaration that the child had the capacity to make the abortion decision herself. This was required to ensure that doctors and hospital trusts could not be sued if they carried out the medical procedure. If the girl was not capable of fully understanding the situation, the local authority would be allowed to terminate the pregnancy if doctors believed it was in her best interests. Making public his ruling yesterday, the judge said the law allowed a child aged under 16 to be given contraception if they had ‘sufficient understanding and intelligence’. Case: Mr Justice Mostyn ruled the teenager was capable of making up her own mind as to whether or not to keep the child. The girl was 21 weeks pregnant when the case went before the High Court (pictured) in March . He said this was the case even if it might lead her to take steps ‘wholly contrary to her best interests’. He said girl A was interviewed by a consultant psychiatrist who concluded very clearly that she had ‘a very clear understanding of her position and of the options that were available to her. 'Those options namely continuance of the pregnancy, or its termination, were discussed.’ Judge: Mr Justice Mostyn said the law allowed a child aged under 16 to be given contraception if they had 'sufficient understanding and intelligence' The psychiatrist said that although A was ‘softly spoken’ she was able to explain to him that her wish was to terminate the pregnancy as ‘she felt that she could not cope with its continuance and it would stress her to a considerable degree.’ He said the decision to have an abortion was not the result of pressure from her parents and grandmother. The psychiatrist said the choice was ‘hers alone and not the product of influence by adults in her family’. The judge said he was ‘completely satisfied’ that A had the mental capacity to decide whether or not to have an abortion. He said her present intention was to have a termination and that her family would be by her side ‘to assist her and support her after what is inevitably going to be an unpleasant and traumatic experience’. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that 5,432 under-16s fell pregnant in 2012, down 9 per cent on the year before. But the toll is still far higher than the average for developed countries including France, Germany and Japan. The health advisory body, NICE, has called for free condoms to be readily handed out at schools, sixth form colleges and youth clubs to cut teen pregnancy rates. Girls as young as 13 have been given contraceptive implants at school without their parents’ knowledge. Nurses insert devices into their arms which temporarily prevent pregnancy by releasing hormones into the blood.

Some 22 years after it was destroyed, Sarajevo is preparing to welcome in a new era for the hall during an official opening ceremony .

"By . Dan Bloom . Trial: Alleged blackmailer Desmond Fraser, 31, arriving at Winchester Crown Court this week . A celebrity who has received several death threats and demands for money was 'genuinely fearful' when an alleged blackmailer threatened to reveal 'extremely embarrassing' information, a court heard today. The star, identified only as T, said he reported concerns to police so often that they would have built up a 'massive file'. But he said the alleged threat by 31-year-old security worker Desmond Fraser, from Wallasey, Merseyside, gave him a 'mini heart attack'. The star, whose identity is protected by a court order, told Winchester Crown Court: 'I have had death threats, I have had all sorts of threats. 'I have had similar things happen with people saying they are going to do things like this in the past... The police will have a massive file'. 'I panicked and went to ground... It gave me a mini heart attack and I felt like I was drowning. 'I did not know what to do. I sought advice and was told to wait until the person played their hand. 'I wanted to know more and see what his hand was. I genuinely believed this information would destroy me. 'This person was absolutely threatening me - beyond a shadow of a doubt... It was like waving a gun around. These are genuine fears and concerns. 'I’m genuinely fearful of the ramifications of what could happen here.' T previously said he was 'petrified' the 'deeply personal' details would be made public and said he was filled with 'fear' and 'panic' when he learned of Fraser’s alleged intentions. The celebrity added: 'At first I thought it could be a wind-up but it caused me some alarm. 'I . get people threatening me and saying silly things all the time but . there was detail there (on this occasion) and I thought there could be . something in it.' A court order bans the press from identifying the victim or the details of the alleged demands. Prosecutor Mary Aspinall-Miles told the court: 'It is material a blackmailer could only dream of.' Orders such as the one made in this case also include comments made on social media, such as Twitter and Facebook. Those breaching the conditions can be prosecuted for contempt of court. Desmond Fraser, 31 (left) allegedly threatened to reveal 'extremely embarrassing' information about the celebrity, who is granted anonymity by Winchester Crown Court. Right: A silhouette of a man (posed by model) Winchester Crown Court heard the information was 'material a blackmailer could only dream of' The order, issued by Judge Susan Evans . QC, said: 'Nothing is to be published identifying the victim of the . charge or the details of the demand of money with menaces. 'No person or persons are to publish those details by any means whatsoever, including publishing between individuals.' A separate order grants anonymity to a number of the alleged victim’s associates. It is common for judges to grant anonymity to alleged blackmail victims, in order to encourage them to come forward to police. Fraser denies one charge of blackmail. The trial continues.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . On the run: Maxwell Parsons, 48, who invented a program that hacked into banking systems, was being hunted by police last night . The mastermind behind a £7.5million credit card scam was being hunted last night. Self-taught computer fraudster Maxwell Parsons, 48, was sentenced to ten years in jail after going on the run in the middle of his fraud trial. He invented a program that hacked into banking systems so payments at ATMs and in chip-and-pin machines could be reversed. This meant his gang could use cards repeatedly without exceeding their credit limits. Most of the frauds were carried out at bureaux de change in Belfast, Manchester and Nottingham. The foreign currencies bought were then converted back into sterling. Parsons ran the scam for nearly two years – raking in up to £50,000 a day – before it was smashed by police in 2010. Yesterday, two of his accomplices were given suspended prison sentences at Manchester Crown Court for their part in the conspiracy. Police believe Parsons, who disappeared in December, could be living under a false name. The IT expert, of Gorton, Manchester, carried out his latest scam after developing his computer and hacking skills through a friend who was attending Cambridge University. He had previously served a 32-month jail term, imposed in 2006, for attaching MP3 players to freestanding cash machines to record customers' data so he could clone their cards. As customers' bank details and pin numbers were punched in, the data from their cards as they were transmitted down a telephone line was illicitly recorded on to the MP3 players. Parsons then used software from the Ukraine to 'translate' the tones from the transactions - before using the stolen data to clone new credit cards. The cards were then used by accomplices to buy £200,000 worth of goods in high street shops, the court heard. Following his release from prison, Parsons created a hacking computer programme called: 'The Merchant dialler', which exploited a flaw in the 'chip and pin' system where money could not be taken from a purchaser's account for up to three days after a transaction. Case: The self-taught computer fraudster was sentenced to ten years in jail at Manchester Crown Court . Usually a bank would 'earmark' the money . spent so cardholders would not exceed their limit, but Parsons would . wire up a laptop via a telephone to the targeted bank's computer and . hack in. This meant he could remove the earmark and enable the card to be used . again. To rake in as much money as possible, Parsons led an army of 100 'shoppers' who would buy genuine goods knowing he could 'reverse' the transactions, the court heard. Most transactions were carried out at bureau de changes, so purchased cash could be converted back into sterling. The scam was fully active between December 2008 and June 2009. Parsons gave himself 50 per cent of all . profits - with the rest being split between other gang members. He even . encrypted his own software so his accomplices would not know how to use . it and steal his secrets. Mastermind: Parsons, pictured outside court, ran the scam for nearly two years - raking in up to £50,000 a day - before it was smashed by police in 2010. Detectives believe the IT expert could be living under a false name . Mark Giuliani, prosecuting, told the court: 'There . were serious concerns that the banking systems were under attack and . that the problem may escalate. 'It was something that had never happened before, in the UK or worldwide, and the banks were not aware that this could actually happen to them. 'This was not a complete reversal of the transaction, but the removal of the electronic earmark on the account. So the actual debit for the goods purchased would eventually accrue to the account. 'The shopper then had the goods bought and also a card which could be used again and again for a period of up to three days. 'As the actual debit would accrue up to three days later there was a limited life to the bank card that was being used and therefore a limit to how much any one card could obtain. 'The more cards that could be used, the more money could be obtained.' Parsons was caught when bosses at Barclay's Bank, who were investigating the sudden losses of money, traced the landlines which were being used to infiltrate their computers. Police were then able to raid three addresses in Manchester and seized a number of computers which showed evidence of the computer programme. They also discovered recently purchased goods relating to the scam including a Playstation 3, an Xbox and a plasma television. Sentencing Parsons, Judge David Stockdale QC, said: 'This is a case which, very understandably, sent shockwaves through the banking industry. Scam: Parsons carried out his latest scam after serving a 32-month jail term, imposed in 2006, for attaching MP3 players to freestanding cash machines to record customers' data so he could clone their cards . 'It was a unique fraud and no other like . it has been detected before or since. Maxwell Parsons created the . device and developed the computer programme and he masterminded its . execution and controlled everyone involved in it and I am sure had the . technological know-how to carry out the fraud. 'He is an articulate, intelligent, vociferous and very demanding individual, adept at the manipulation of those around him and he even manipulated members of his legal team. 'Maxwell Parsons was the organiser and driving force behind this conspiracy.. Without him I have no doubt it would not and could not have taken place. 'He masterminded the entire enterprise from start to finish. He is a technically skilled, sophisticated computer fraudster.' Takhliq Khaliq, 47, of Heaton Mersey, was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 200 hours unpaid work after he admitted conspiracy and false accounting. His brother Zaki Khaliq, 44, of Bramhall, Cheshire, also admitted conspiracy and will be sentenced later. Meanwhile, Muhammed Khan, 43, of Alexandra Road South, Whalley Range, Manchester, admitted conspiracy and was sentenced to 16 months imprisonment, suspended for two years. Yesterday, Detective Constable Carol Britton, of Greater Mancherster Police said: 'This was a systematic, sophisticated and large-scale fraud where a number of people were able to effectively steal money quickly. 'Parsons is a prolific criminal who has deliberately been evasive with the authorities at every opportunity. Throughout this investigation and the trial he has done all he can to delay this day. 'He is a well-practiced, convincing and persuasive liar and can talk himself out of almost any situation. If you recognise this man then please do the right thing straight away and call the police. 'Since this conspiracy, the banks themselves have worked very hard to ensure that a similar scam could not happen again.'","Maxwell Parsons, 48, masterminded multi-million pound credit card scam .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Neighbours from hell: Eugene Bird (above) and his sons Sean and Michael subjected those that lived near them to a six-year campaign of terror . Three neighbours from hell who subjected those living close by to a six-year-long campaign of terror have finally been evicted – but even now many who knew them are too scared to speak out. Eugene Bird, 54, and his two sons Sean, 21, and Michael, 19, vandalised homes, threatened neighbours, wielded swords and knives and stoned firefighters as they tackled a nearby inferno. The lengthy list of the family’s crimes includes stealing lead from the roofs of adjoining properties. Now the . three men - who moved to Ithon Grove in Kings Norton, Birmingham in 2008 . - have had their council house repossessed and received two-year . anti-social behaviour injunctions. Under . the orders, the family can only enter the estate to visit relatives . and, if they breach it, can be arrested and hauled before the courts. Despite . these injunctions - which mean the trio cannot enter the estate other . than to visit relatives - most neighbours are too terrified to talk . about the family for fear of repercussions. One . resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ‘They’re always riding . motorbikes around the grove where the kids are playing. ‘I’ve shouted at them and their dad to get them to stop, but they just laugh, and they only stop when they get bored. ‘They . live on an alley which backs on to my garden, and they keep us up every . night when they’ve got people round and they’re making a right racket. ‘In the last few months their behaviour had improved - but that’s only because they had been threatened with eviction.’ Anti-social: One resident said that the sons, Sean (left) and Michael (right), would often ride motorcycles near where children would play . Sinister: Sean Bird posted pictures of himself on Facebook wielding fearsome weaponry and wearing a mask . The . problem family had been given support to help them clean up their act . but continued to ignore warnings from Birmingham City Council’s Housing . Team and West Midlands Police. Another scared neighbour explained: ‘The council calling it a campaign of terror is a massive understatement.’ Officers . from the council’s housing team worked in conjunction with the police to . gather a damning portfolio of evidence and successfully secure the . injunctions after local people spoke out. Menacing: Sean Bird, pictured above posing for his Facebook page, was the elder of the two sons that terrorised a Birmingham housing estate . Armed: Sean Bird is seen wearing a silver mask as he brandishes a sword in this photograph . Intimidation: Sean (left) and Michael (right), along with their father, were given the chance to clean up their act, but ignored warnings from the council and the police . Facebook photograph: Sean Bird uploaded a picture of what appears to be drug paraphernalia to the internet . Dangerous weapon: Sean posted a picture of this huge knife on his Facebook page . Rude gesture: A picture of Sean Bird uploaded to a social media site . The family were offered support to help them change their ways but chose to ignore the warnings. After . the injunctions were handed out, Rob James, from the council, said: . ‘These injunctions demonstrate strong support from the courts in . protecting our communities from this sort of behaviour.‘Despite . previous warnings and attempts to engage with this family the . anti-social behaviour and criminal activity continued so we had no . alternative but to take legal action.’ Inspector . Vanessa Eyles, responsible for policing in the area, said: ‘This is an . excellent example of the importance of partnership work. Neighbours said that the Birds' behaviour had improved recently - but perhaps because the threat of eviction was hanging over them . Desperate measure: The family have had this house in Kings Norton, Birmingham, repossessed . Ban: The trio cannot enter the estate other than to visit relatives . The Bird family made life a misery for the residents of Ithon Grove . ‘It highlights to the community that everyone should have the right to enjoy their neighbourhood without fear of harassment and if there is a particular family causing intimidation and disruption we will take action to ensure this is resolved. ‘This can take time and does rely on public support and people speaking out but these Injunctions send a clear message to offenders that the local community, police and the council will not stand for anti-social behaviour.’ The injunctions and eviction come during a blitz on anti-social behaviour across the area codenamed operation PACT.","Eugene Bird and sons Sean and Michael have had their home repossessed .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Brooke Butler who was strapped in to her £40 car seat in the back of the car escaped without a scratch when her father's car turned over . A tiny baby who survived a horrific car crash which destroyed the vehicle she was travelling in was found laughing while still strapped in her seat. Brooke Butler, 10-months-old, and her parents, Tom, 25, and fiancée Kirsty Hobley, 20, were driving home on an A-road when Mr Butler swerved to avoid a pheasant near the village of Pillerton Priors in Warwickshire. The family’s V-reg Rover 400 toppled onto its side as it careered across the road before hitting a grass verge and falling back onto all four wheels. Brooke, who was strapped in her £40 car seat in the back of the vehicle escaped without a scratch.

The young . family were taken from the scene on the A422 to Warwick Hospital but were discharged that night . and housewife Ms Hobley is now recovering from her cuts and bruises. ‘Of . course I was always told to hit the things but instinct took over and . when I saw those eyes I turned the wheel.

Write-off: Paramedics and firemen rushed to the scene and cut Tom free from the vehicle following the crash on May 2 . ‘It went up on the driver’s side which is the side my daughter was on in the back. ‘The car righted itself but I couldn’t open my door so climbed out of the window and managed to yank the back door open. ‘I got my daughter out and as soon as I picked her up she started giggling. It shocked me completely. ‘Even with her laughing I still wanted Brooke checked over and everything, in case of anything internal. ‘But she was completely unharmed and even fell asleep on the way to the hospital in the ambulance. ‘We spent £40 on a car seat and it is the best £40 I have ever spent in my life. ‘It definitely saved our daughter’s life.’ Lucky: Tom Butler and fiancée Kirsty Hobley, 20, were driving home from Banbury, Oxon, when Mr Butler swerved on the A422 near the village of Pillerton Priors to avoid a pheasant .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Ukip today confirmed its controversial MEP Roger Helmer will fight the upcoming Newark by-election for the party - despite recent controversy over a series of remarks about homosexuality. Mr Helmer sparked outrage in 2012 after likening gay marriage to incest. The 70-year-old has also claimed people should be able to prefer being straight to being gay - like some people prefer Earl Grey to ordinary tea. Roger Helmer has rarely avoided controversy during his career as an MEP, but has been returned to Brussels three times . And in 2000 he said being gay is ‘not worthy of valid equal respect’. Mr Helmer's selection comes after Ukip leader Nigel Farage ducked the chance to fight the Nottinghamshire seat. The byelection was called after the disgraced former Tory MP Patrick Mercer resigned in the wake of a cash-for-questions scandal. Mr Helmer was elected to the European Parliament in 1999 as the Tory MEP for the East Midlands - and re-elected in 2004 and 2009 - before defecting to Ukip in March 2012. His outspoken views have caused controversy throughout his career and last year even Mr Farage said he had gone 'too far' with his attack on gay marriage. In 2012 Mr Helmer said: 'If two men have a right to marry, how can we deny the same right to two siblings? Are we to authorise incest?' His made the bombshell remarks in a pamphlet entitled 'Straight Talking on Europe'. Nigel Farage decided not to fight the Newark by-election - leaving himself open to accusations that he 'bottled' his big chance . The year before he asked: 'Why is it OK for a surgeon to perform a sex-change operation, but not OK for a psychiatrist to try to ""turn"" a consenting homosexual?' Mr Helmer has also dismissed homophobia as a 'weasel word'. He said: 'The homosexual lobby is not content with decriminalisation. It wants to be accepted as a ""valid alternative lifestyle"". 'But it is not a valid lifestyle worthy of equal respect. 'At the risk of offending the politically correct, I will argue that homosexual behaviour is abnormal and undesirable.' He previously questioned the existence of 'homophobia', saying some people found gay relationships 'distasteful if not viscerally repugnant'. He defended the remarks, saying: 'Different people have different tastes. You may tell me you don't like Earl Grey tea. That may be a minority view but you are entitled not to like it if you don't like it. The Ukip candidate added: 'I simply made the point that people were entitled to their personal preferences. 'It is morally acceptable to prefer heterosexuality over homosexuality, or vice versa. Most of us prefer one or the other.' He later added: 'I said that people may prefer heterosexuality or homosexuality. I did not say that people could dislike – much less hate – other people on the grounds of their sexual orientation. 'The mainstream media are engaged in a feeding frenzy against Ukip, and are prepared to twist the facts to suit their agenda.' Mr Helmer also insists that he has condemned homophobia during his career. He said 'prejudice, hostility and violence against homosexuals are wrong and totally unacceptable'. But Mr Helmer's controversial views are not restricted to homosexuality. He has claimed that women who are date raped must ‘share part of the responsibility’. Mr Helmer said in 'stranger rape' the blame was 'squarely on the perpetrator' but in date rape cases 'the victim surely shares a part of the responsibility, if only for establishing reasonable expectations in her boyfriend’s mind'. The outspoken MEP has also claimed the Catholic Church was ‘systematically paedophilic’. He said: ‘So far as I know it has no rules or systems designed to support or promote paedophilia. 'But I think it would be perfectly fair to describe it as systemically paedophile.’ Despite Mr Helmer's controversial past, he was 'overwhelmingly' endorsed by the Newark constituency association at a hustings meeting on Monday before being backed by Ukip's National Executive Committee, a party spokesman said. Mr Helmer said: 'I am both proud and humbled to have been selected by the constituency association in Newark to represent the UKIP cause in this historic town in what could well prove to be an historic by-election.' 'It would be a huge honour to be elected to serve as Newark’s MP and I will be giving my all over the next few weeks to achieve that outcome.' Mr Farage said: 'He is a massively experienced and respected figure on the national political stage and on the local political stage as well. 'I know that the Ukip membership will rally to the cause of making Roger our first directly elected MP.' The Newark by-election is scheduled to take place on June 5, with the Conservatives selecting Robert Jenrick to run and Labour represented by Michael Payne. The Lib Dems are expected to choose a candidate in the coming days.","Roger Helmer sparked fury over a series of remarks about homosexuality .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Tucked away under a grassy hill, at first glance this incredible subterranean house could have stepped off the pages of The Hobbit, but look a little closer and rather than Bilbo Baggins's quaint cosy cottage it in fact bears more resemblance to a James Bond villain's underground lair. Dubbed Walnut Burrow - a name which somewhat betrays its state of the art design - the £2.5million home in Loudwater, Hertfordshire, took 18 months to build with developers having to excavate 5,000 tons of soil before work could get underway. The one-of-a-kind dwelling has four . bedrooms, all of which are en-suite, a huge living room, dining room and . kitchen, a cinema and a central courtyard. And . all of this is hidden hidden below ground level - with the developers . behind the brand-new home given the strict task of building a property . out of sight of the neighbours. Underground: Tucked away under a grassy hill, at first glance this . incredible subterranean house in Loudwater, Hertfordshire, could have . stepped off the pages of The Hobbit . Modern: Look a little closer and rather than Bilbo Baggins's quaint cosy cottage it in fact bears more resemblance to a James Bond villain's state-of-the art underground lair . All mod cons: The one-of-a-kind dwelling has four bedrooms, all of which are en-suite, a huge living room, dining room and kitchen, a cinema and a central courtyard . Secret: Most of the home is hidden hidden below ground level - with the developers behind the brand-new home given the strict task of building a property out of sight of the neighbours . Lighten up: To keep natural daylight, the house has a 45-foot long south facing expanse of glass which serves the kitchen, dining and living areas, opening onto a sunken courtyard . Unique: The home, which was recently finished, has been put up for sale . for £2.5 million with estate agents Savills describing it as 'stylish . and unique underground home' Amazing: 'It is the most amazing and unique house which I have had the pleasure of selling,' said Sue Trybus, from Savills . View from below: 'Even though it is underground, the amount of light it unbelievable,' said Ms Trybus. 'There is a lovely courtyard which acts as a suntrap' Out to impress: Ms trybus said the house would be ideal for a professional footballer, or a celebrity who is looking for something architecturally impressive . Night in: Homeowners would not need to pop to the nearest multiplex to catch a movie as the house has its own cinema, complete with a nine-foot screen . Cooking up a storm: The home has programmable lighting, solar panels and a state-of-the-art heat recovery and ventilation system, while amateur chefs would love the bespoke German kitchen . Entrance: An oak front door opens into the hall with contemporary cloakroom. The main reception room and kitchen have sliding doors to a lit courtyard . Floor plan: The rooms of the luxury home are positioned around the central courtyard and there is a large open plan kitchen and living area .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Ed Miliband has boasted he is smarter than David Cameron, and does not need anyone else to tell him what to think. In a bid to shake off his reputation for being ‘weird’, the Labour leader posed at home in casualwear for a newspaper interview to prove he ready to be Prime Minister. But Mr Miliband’s claim to have ‘much more intellectual self-confidence’ risked backfiring because he actually got a worse degree than Mr Cameron. Labour leader Ed Miliband boasted that he has the 'intellectual confidence' to take on David Cameron, despite gaining an inferior degree . A recent poll found 40 per cent of people think Mr Miliband is ‘weird’ and a third suspected he was bullied at school. Labour strategists privately admit that many voters are put-off by their leader’s focus on abstract concepts such as ‘pre-distribution’, ‘predators’ and ‘responsible capitalism’. Today he moved to win over swing voters in the South East with a pledge to crackdown on rich landlords buying up property in London but leaving it empty. The announcement will be used to prove he is in touch with ordinary voters' concerns. Meanwhile, portraying Mr Miliband as ‘weird’ and . ill-suited to being Prime Minister is expected to be a key plank of the . Tory election attack. David Cameron, pictured in Downing Street today, gained a first class degree in PPE . In an interview with the Evening Standard today, Mr Miliband brushed off the abuse, claiming he is clever than Mr Cameron. He said: ‘What’s interesting is that of the two leaders in this who could be Prime Minister, between myself and David Cameron, I feel I am the one with much more intellectual self-confidence, actually. ‘I’m not the guy who says, “Oh I just want to be Prime Minister because it is a place to reach”. I actually have strong beliefs about how to change the country. This is an incredibly powerful weapon. ‘If you think about what sustains me — and it is not the easiest job in the world being leader of the opposition — what sustained me over three-and-a-half years is that sense of deep conviction. ‘I look at David Cameron across the dispatch box and I think to myself, I’m the one with the intellectual self-confidence because I actually know what I believe and I don’t need Lynton Crosby to tell me.’ He added that Mr Cameron was trying to avoid election TV debates because ‘he obviously doesn’t have the confidence’. However, making an issue of intelligence could come back to haunt Mr Miliband, who famously only secured a 2:1 in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Mr Cameron, by contrast, gained a first after studying PPE at Brasenose College, Oxford. A poll in March by YouGov for BuzzFeed found some 41 per cent of voters think Ed Miliband is 'weird', compared to only 27 per cent who thought the same of David Cameron . More than half of under-24s think Mr Miliband is weird, the opinion poll found . Mr Miliband also rejected the idea that the Tories will portray him as ‘weird’ as the general election nears. ‘Have they decided that? I think the Tories are very unclear how they are to attack me. Half the time they say it is “back to the Seventies”.  Half the time they say, “He doesn’t seem to stand for anything”.’ Mr Miliband meanwhile today promised a new crackdown on 'ghost homes' being hoarded by wealthy investors across London. The Labour leader claimed rich owners leave 60,000 properties standing empty driving in the capital up house prices for everyone else. He told the Evening Standard: 'We’ve got to stop this phenomenon of empty properties being bought by overseas investors and nothing done about it. 'We live in one of the richest, most diverse and exciting cities that has ever existed on the planet, but the connection between the great wealth London creates and everyday family finances has been broken.' Labour would double council tax for owners who let their flats lie empty and unused. And after the property has been empty for a year, councils would have powers to impose a 100 per cent increase in bills.","Labour leader boasts of how he is smarter across the dispatch box .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . MPs are on course to earn more than £60,000 from the BBC this year, figures have revealed. In the first four months of the year the corporation paid Members of Parliament £20,000 to appear on its TV shows. The figures are buried in the latest register of members interests, which lists MPs' earnings on top of their £67,060 salary. MPs sparked a furious public outcry when their expense claims were exposed. But they are still free to top up their £67,000 a year salary - as long as they declare it openly . The revelation, revealed by Press Gazette, is likely to infuriate voters and licence fee payers who earn a fraction of an MP's salary without option of extra work. Some £8,000 of the BBC's £20,000 bill went to Tory MP Rory Stewart for his documentary 'Border', about the area between England and Scotland. Labour's Alan Johnson was paid £5,317, between December 16 last year and March 27. Fellow Labour MP Dianne Abbott, a regular on Andrew Neil's This Week alongside former Tory minister Michael Portillo, has raked in £2,800. Labour's Sadiq Khan and Tory Tim Loughton have both been paid £1,500 for appearances on Have I Got News For You. Mr Khan donated his money to charity. But no MP can match moonlighting London Mayor Boris Johnson when it comes to outside earnings from the media. Mr Johnson pockets £250,000 a year for his weekly column in The Daily Telegraph. BBC Director General Tony Hall promised to crack down on excesses at the Corporation. Many voters will question whether it is fair that they pay for an MP's salary - and for them to appear on TV . The Mayor has previously defended his mega pay packet - even claiming it was 'chicken feed'. He said: 'I don't see why, on a Sunday morning I shouldn't knock off an article. 'If . someone wants to pay me for that article, then that's their lookout – . and of course I make a substantial donation to charity. 'Maybe . that money shouldn't go to charity; maybe you'd rather I didn't make . those contributions to charity. It seems to me to be a wholly reasonable . thing to do.' According to the register of MPs’ interests newspapers have so far this year paid MPs some £17,905.40 . The Telegraph has so far this year paid MPs £6,990, according to the register. This includes a monthly payment of £400 to Tory backbencher Douglas Careswell to write three blog posts a week. Former Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain meanwhile, was paid £1,650 for just one Sunday Telegraph article. The Mail newspapers have so far paid MPs £6,100 for their work this year. Former Tory leadership candidate David Davis has been paid £3,800 for three articles, while I'm A Celebrity contestant Nadine Dorries has been paid £1,900. The Times and Sunday Times meanwhile paid £2,000 to MPs on the register. The Financial Times meanwhile has paid Tory John Barron £2,000 so far this year. And The Independent has paid £1,250 to Labour's Chris Bryant as well as £165.40 to former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw. Elsewhere, the controversial Respect MP George Galloway has been paid £6,400 for work on Russia Today - the broadcaster recently praised by Vladimir Putin for its 'objective' reporting on Crimea.","Long running Friday night satire pays MPs £1,500 to appear on the show .

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Joel Christie . and Lydia Warren . Amid a firestorm of sexual abuse allegations, X-Men director Bryan Singer ducked in for a meal at West Hollywood’s upscale Nobu restaurant earlier this week. The filmmaker was photographed Tuesday night emerging from the sushi restaurant with a group of male friends. The 48-year-old award-winning director and producer was pictured on the occasion wearing a plaid shirt with a white jacket slung over his arm as he went to a silver Audi waiting outside. Night out: X-Men director Bryan Singer, pictured in a plaid shirt with a white jacket slung over his arm, went out for dinner with friends at West Hollywood's upscale Nobu restaurant . Entourage: Singer's unidentified male friends first checked for paparazzi before walking out to a silver Audi waiting for them outside . The beleaguered filmmaker's unidentified companions first checked if the coast was clear of stalking paparazzi before heading out the door. Singer's casual night out at the Hollywood hotspot frequented by celebrities came a day after a 25-year-old British man came forward accusing the openly gay X-Men creator of sexually abusing him when he was 17 years old. The latest accuser filed a lawsuit Monday alleging that the Hollywood heavyweight performed lewd acts on him in a London hotel room in 2006 along with Broadway producer Gary Goddard. Holding the pictures up to the media at a Los Angeles press conference, the unidentified man's attorney, Jeff Herman, said that his client was spurred to bring a lawsuit against the filmmaker after Singer was sued by another man on similar grounds. Out and about: Singer's night out came a day after a 25-year-old British man accused the openly gay filmmaker of sexually abusing him when he was 17 years old . The lawsuit in federal court in Los . Angeles said that Singer and . Goddard, 59, coerced the British man into sex acts as a minor with the . promise of helping him in an acting career. This is . the second lawsuit naming Singer ahead of the May 23 release of his film . X-Men: Days of Future Past, which is expected to be one of the year's . top grossing movies. Singer's . lawyer has called the allegations in both lawsuits false and . fabrications, and a bid to win money from the director behind other . films in the X-Men superhero franchise. A lawyer for Goddard also denied . the allegations, calling them spurious. Today: Attorney Jeff Herman produces a picture of his client (left, with face muzzed out) alongside director Bryan Singer (center left), producer Gary Goddard (center right) and actor Frank Langella (right - who is not connected with the allegations in any way) from the London premiere of Superman Returns in 2006 . Bombshell claims: Michael Egan (left) sued Singer (right) and three others last month, accusing them of being part of an underage sex ring . Jeff Herman also represents Michael Egan, who last . month sued Singer, Goddard and two other entertainment bigwigs over explosive . allegations that they abused him as part of an underage sex ring in . Hollywood. 'He did this to . support Mike, he realized he wasn't the only one this happened to,' Herman said at a news conference as he held aloft pictures of his client . with Singer and Goddard from the 2006 premiere of Superman Returns in . London. According to The Daily Beast, Singer and Goddard allegedly engaged in inappropriate acts with a British teenager in the bedroom of a London suite around the time of the release of Superman Returns - which Singer directed - in 2006.

Also pictured is actor Frank Langella - who is not connected with the allegations in any way . Evening: Bryan Singer (right with a friend) is seen sitting next to his British accuser (center with face blurred) and actor Frank Langella (left) The suit has been filed by Egan's attorney on behalf on the plaintiff identified only as 'John Doe No. 117'. It claims Goddard contacted the teen when he was 14 via social media, commenting John Doe was attractive and that he knew people who could help jump-start his acting career. One of those people, Goddard said, was Singer. Thereafter, Goddard told the boy he was in love with him, and 'convinced' the boy to send him nude photographs and a video masturbating. They then allegedly engaged in a webcam session which involved Goddard masturbating. When John Doe was 16, Goddard invited him to London and plied with the boy with alcohol, before he  'engaged him in anal intercourse'. When the teenager was 17, the suit alleges, Goddard told the teenager he and Singer were coming to London for a Superman movie premiere. At the after-party, the suit alleges that Singer offered the teenager a Quaalude, which the teenager rejected. The lawsuit described how Singer then proceeded to fondle the young man, forced him to masturbate while sitting on his naked lap, and how the famous director of The Usual Suspects allegedly attempted to have anal sex with the teenager. Besieged: Longtime friends Gary Goddard and Bryan Singer - seen here in New York in 2009 - have been accused of sexually assaulting two men when they minors . The suit contends that Singer violated the law by sexually assaulting the teenager, traveling to a foreign country for 'illicit conduct with a minor,' that he had arranged to 'meet with a minor to engage in lewd and lascivious behavior', and that by allegedly coercing the teenager in the way he did, Singer committed an act of 'gender violence' against him. Marty Singer, the lawyer for Bryan Singer, told The Daily Beast the allegations contained in the latest lawsuit were 'totally untrue'. Singer is already fighting the claims brought forward by Egan, who said he was given drugs and promises of a . Hollywood career while being threatened and sexually abused in Los . Angeles and Hawaii. One . of Egan's alleged attackers, internet businessman Marc Collins-Rector, was . convicted of sex abuse charges in the years after the attacks, but it was the first time Singer was named. Garth Ancier - who produced and/or developed shows like 21 Jump Street, Married ... with Children and The Simpsons - has adamantly denied laying a finger on the Michael Egan . His . lawyer said the director was never interviewed by any authorities about . the claims made by Egan, who has said that he reported the Los Angeles acts . and doesn't know why charges were not pursued. Days . after filing the suit against Singer, Egan filed additional . suits against former BBC Worldwide America president Garth Ancier, . former Disney TV president David Neuman and theme park design firm head . Gary Goddard. Attorneys for Goddard called the charges 'without merit,' while David Neuman addressed the charges in a series of tweets, calling them 'completely false' and 'shocking'. Egan . appeared at a news conference last month alongside his mother and sex . abuse attorney Jeff Herman at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills. 'Hollywood . adults are armed with something other adults aren’t armed with,' said . Herman. 'It’s a tremendous amount of power...the power and influence to . really make kids careers.' Scandalous: Now that director Bryan Singer is embroiled in two teen sexual assault lawsuits, someone still has to go out and promote X-Men: Days of Future Past . MailOnline does not typically name . victims of sex abuse but is naming Egan because he is speaking publicly . about his allegations.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It took a jury only a day of deliberation to find Jae Williams guilty of the first-degree murder Wednesday in what prosecutors called the thrill-killing of 15-year-old high school classmate Michael Russell  in 2009. Williams, now 20, wept as the jury read their verdict. His family was in tears before the verdict was even read. Williams, tried as an adult, will be sentenced on July 11. Jae Williams appears in court Wednesday for a guilty verdict that could put him in prison for the rest of his life. Williams was found guilty of first-degree murder Wednesday in the thrill-killing of a 15-year-old Santa Teresa High School . According to prosecutors, Williams was only 15 when he and alleged accomplice Randy Thompson went to Russell's home carrying knives. The pair lured him outside with the promise of marijuana, then tacked the boy, stabbing him repeatedly and even chocking him until he was dead in the backyard of his South San Jose home. Thompson, 16 at the time of the homicide, will stand trial now that Williams' case is finished. Both boys face life sentences. More than 70 people filled the courtroom for the verdict, including San Jose police detectives who got William's confession and District Attorney Jeff Rosen. As Thompson's trial is pending, they declined comment on the verdict. In a videotaped confession recorded just 48 hours after Michael was killed, Williams said he and Thompson were involved in Satanism and had already beaten a cat to death. 'I guess I just finally wanted to kill somebody,' he said. 'I had my chance and took it.' San Jose Mercury News quoted him. Alleged accomplice accomplice Randy Thompson will be tried next month. The pair allegedly lured their victim out of his house by promising him marijuana . In his confession, Williams described his role in several different ways, ranging from only watching Thompson attack Michael to pinning the boy down himself and slitting his throat. Regardless of whether he actually attacked the boy or simply aided Thompson, prosecutor Valerie McGuire told jurors in her closing arguments that he was guilty of premeditated murder. Other evidence included a chef's knife stolen from Thompson's kitchen and covered in Michael's blood, and a sweatshirt with William's DNA and Michael's blood. Williams claimed he disposed of the weapon, sweatshirt, and one other blood-stained jacket in a dumpster. Police later recovered the items in nearby bushes. Defense attorney Lewis Romero argued that it was the Thompson family that carried our the murder and that they had engaged in a coverup to frame Williams. Romero presented witnesses arguing that Williams gave a false confession, partially because he was sleep deprived in a holding cell. Prosecutors said Williams and an accomplice named Thompson lured classmate Michael Russell outside his home, then choked and stabbed him to death . However McGuire argued that Michael was in fact 'butchered' by the two defendants, having been stabbed at least a dozen times. Causes of death after the six-minute attack was listed as stabbing and asphyixiation. Michael's uncle would later discover his body and attempt to revive him. In close, Romero asked for an acquittal arguing that he is opposed to 'locking children up in adult cages for the rest of their lives.' As jurors are barred from weighing potential sentences in their decisions, they were ordered to discount the remark.","Prosecutors said Jae Williams and alleged accomplice Randy Thompson lured then-15-year-old Michael Russell out of his San Jose home to murder him in 2009 .

"By . Associated Press . Perhaps the reason notoriously aggressive Boston drivers don't use their turn signals is that no one's ever put it in terms they understand. The Massachusetts Department of Transportation on Friday changed that by posting messages on electronic highway signs around the city that read: 'Changing Lanes? Use Yah Blinkah.' 'Blinkah' is how Bostonians pronounce 'blinker,' otherwise known as a turn signal. An electronic highway sign is seen on Interstate 93 in Boston, Friday, May 9, 2014. The Massachusetts Department of Transportation posted the message ""Changing Lanes? Use Yah Blinkah"" on the signs around the city. ""Blinkah"" is how Bostonians pronounce ""blinker"". (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer) The signs are scheduled to stay up through the Mother's Day on Sunday, which state officials say is one of the busiest traffic days of the year. The law, which clearly requires the use of a signal when changing lanes, is widely ignored.

So they had just seven weeks to write all the music and lyrics, rehearse 15 musicians and 30 soloists and record cameos from the likes of Stephen Fry, Jon Snow, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and Will Young. Plus, they had the mindboggling pressure of having to declare their declarations without a single mistake, for legal reasons, while the cameras were running – and sing their vows to each other as-live in front of their friends, relatives and several celebrities. Despite both being brilliant performers and composers, with Mr Till having penned musicals for national TV before, and Mr Taylor being a seasoned West End performer – tempers inevitably frayed on the run-up to the big day. Here come the grooms: Nathan Taylor and Benjamin Till (left) after becoming Mr and Mr, with celebrity guest Gok Wan pictured right . On song: Our Gay Wedding: The Musical features friends and family of the grooms - and many of them are established professional singers . Speedy: The musical was written by Mr Till and Mr Taylor in just seven weeks . Mr Till, 39, told Femail: ‘It was mayhem. I slammed a door a day. I threw my headphones across the room on countless occasions. Seven weeks all in to write, record, recruit, perform, film and organise a wedding. We're mad. But also the luckiest men alive!’ In the end, the big day went incredibly smoothly – and Femail had a ringside seat, because the author of this article has known Mr Till for over two decades and was a guest at the ceremony in a Victorian theatre inside London’s Alexandra Palace. He also has a very small part to play in the video involving a sausage and an egg... The experience was an emotional rollercoaster – and will make for a highly entertaining slice of TV. Guest Gok Wan described it as 'fantastic'. But we've a feeling that thousands of others will think the same after it's aired. Mums are the word: Noelle Till and Mr Taylor's mother, Celia Lawley, sing a very moving duet in the Musical . Highlights include the grooms being walked up to the aisle while The Feeling sing a beautiful arrangement of The Beach Boys’ God Only Knows, a rendition of Respect by Erasure’s Andy Bell – who was in fine voice – and a touching duet featuring the grooms’ mothers, about how they felt when their sons came out. When that was played back to the 200 guests at the ceremony, there wasn’t a dry eye in the house.Tears bubbled up with equal force when the vows were sung, too. This is the part where the happy couple reach into their hearts and express their undying love for each other in their own words. Cameo: Channel 4 news anchor Jon Snow gets in on the act . Hair we go: Singer and actor Dan Cooper is one of the performers . Mover and shaker: Choreographer Drew McOnie gives the guests some instructions . Respect is due: Andy Bell from 1980s band Erasure, pictured here with his partner Stephen Ross, performed an arrangement of one of his hits . Happy days: Mr Till with smiling guests (from left to right) Jo Emery, Nicola Harrison, Emily McKensie and Natalie Walter at the reception . Groom Mr Till on the figures involved: . 120 hours in the recording studio . Three weeks of solid writing starting at 8am and finishing at 2am in the morning . One day off in seven weeks (for the stag do) 200 guests all of whom need to learn two numbers . 150 members of the London Gay Men's Chorus . 30 soloists . 15 musicians . It was an emotional high point that left the grooms struggling to keep their voices steady. Mr Taylor said afterwards: ‘When we sung our vows to each other, I’m not quite sure how either of us held it together. We just held on to each other’s hands for dear life and looked into each other’s eyes. It was the most intense thing. It was like the world wasn’t there at that point, that we were the only two people there. It was magical.’ Mr Till said: ‘Listening to Nathan’s vows for the first time, I was in such shock at how beautiful it sounded. Also because it was orchestrated by Fiona [Brice], a very close friend, so I could hear her voice in the background as well.’ Possibly the most intense moment for the grooms, however, was actually the part when they had to speak. By law, the declarations of intent, when the couple say their full names and solemnly swear to stand by their other half, have to be spoken. If either Mr Till or Mr Taylor had gone wrong – even if they were unclear - the registrar would have had to correct them and that would have formed part of the show. Not ideal television. You’ll have to tune in on Monday to see how that scene went. Some, however, won’t be tuning in to Our Gay Wedding: The Musical – because they appear to have written it off before it’s even aired. What pressure? Groom Nathan Taylor looks composed and relaxed during his performance . Flamboyant: The Musical is a colourful celebration of gay rights . The Feeling's Dan Gillespie Sells sings the grooms up the aisle for an event he believes is very significant. He said: 'It’s very significant for many reasons. Being a gay man, it means that I’m now on a level footing with other people in society who want to represent and show their love for another human being and for it to be recognised in the same way, by all kinds of different groups, by the tradition of marriage. ‘I think it’s important for marriage, as well, because I think, to flip it on its head, I believe that marriage needs us gays as much as much as we need marriage. Without this constant evolution of traditions, they kind of lose their footings and become pointless. So it’s a great thing for marriage as well as being a great thing for gay rights' One Pink News reader said ‘I can't believe Stephen Fry is hosting what is likely to be car crash TV’ and another commented: ‘I was hoping for some gravitas on this one off, ground-breaking, historic moment [gay marriage being legalised].’ The show does in fact have its serious moments, with Andy Bell singing to a backdrop of facts and figures about how laws that repressed homosexuals have gradually been rolled back over the years. Guest Nicola Harrison described that moment afterwards as ‘almost overwhelming’. Mr Till just hopes that people give it a chance. He said: ‘This is a dignified, political piece. Anyone who would attempt to judge it before seeing it, simply doesn't understand the importance of music and that's not a debate I can even enter into. 'This is a musical about March 29, which just happens to feature our wedding. That's really important. It's a political piece as much as it's a piece about celebration. It's also a piece about hope. If, in the UK, we can go, in 50 years, from being second class citizens who were blackmailed and often sent to jail, to being people who are able to get married on TV, then there's hope for teenagers in Russia, Nigeria, Sudan...’ It’s also a musical that features incredibly catchy songs. Afterwards, John Hay, the show’s Commissioning Editor, told Femail that he’s been waking up with the tunes in his head and walking down the street humming them. And director Ellen Hobson added: ‘Benjamin Till? That boy can write a song.’ Our Gay Wedding: The Musical airs on Monday March 31 at 10pm on Channel 4.

"By . Laurie Whitwell . Follow @@lauriewhitwell . Ryan Bertrand has an interesting take on the match that made him famous overnight. Thrust into the starting XI against Bayern Munich on May 19, 2012, he did the job requested of him by Roberto Di Matteo to help Chelsea claim Champions League glory. ‘It’s something I don’t want people to forget, I’ve had success at the highest level,’ says Bertrand. ‘But, personally, I don't want to rest on my laurels, I've got the taste and it’s something I want to actively pursue. I want that again.’ VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Bertrand talk about his Chelsea future . Onwards and upwards: Ryan Bertrand wants progress, which he won't find warming the bench at Chelsea . Limelight: Bertrand filled in to help Chelsea win the 2012 Champions League against Bayern Munich . It is that mentality that influences his next choice; to stick or twist. Bertrand does not want to be remembered solely as the shock selection that paid off; he craves fresh accomplishments. He made 38 appearances last campaign, as well as earning two England caps, and when Chelsea turned down an approach from Liverpool in the summer Bertrand believed game-time under Jose Mourinho would follow. Yet after only 244 minutes of action in the first-half of this season he went on loan to Aston Villa in January in search of football and has enjoyed a personally successful spell despite the team’s struggles. This summer will be the most definitive of his career; talks with Mourinho will determine his future. ‘At the start of this season the aim was to play first-team football and that’s the impression I was under,’ says Bertrand. ‘That’s the reason I was at Chelsea; I’ve never been one to just sit there and be comfortable in my surroundings. ‘If you look at my record since I’ve been back at Chelsea from my loan spells (in January 2011), the games have been increasing by season – as long as I could see that I was always happy to stay . ‘The start of this season has been the only time when there has been quite a delay in my development. As soon as those alarm bells were ringing it was important I got out to play. Farmed out: The 24-year-old has had a decent run of games after being loaned out to struggling Aston Villa . ‘It’s something we’ll sit down and talk about in the summer. At this stage in my career I need to be playing. To go back next year to Chelsea and sit on the bench is not what I want. ‘I feel I deserve the chance to play consistently, having had the experiences that I have done under numerous managers.’ At 24 years old that feeling is understandable. If Bertrand were to depart it would leave promises about increasing the number of home-grown graduates in the Chelsea team sounding hollow. Here is a player, signed by tribunal from Gillingham in 2005, who has developed through the system only to find a blockage at the end. Villa represented a good opportunity and while a relegation fight was not on the agenda it has added a string to Bertrand’s bow. Brendan Rodgers, who Bertrand knows from his Chelsea days, was again interested in the winter window but by this time Liverpool were title challengers and Chelsea could not countenance assisting a direct rival. Tug of war: Jose Mourinho has refused Brendan Rodgers' (R) attempts to take Bertrand to Liverpool . Loan ranger: Bertrand is prepared to travel anywhere to play - having already spent time with six clubs . Villa’s financial situation means a permanent switch to Birmingham for Bertrand, who has a house with his Brazilian girlfriend and two-year-old daughter in Surrey, is unlikely. ‘If I was to leave Chelsea I want to stay within the best teams in the Premier League. To keep my own ambitions to progress and play for England I need to be right up there, playing consistently at a decent level.’ Bertrand has two years left on his Chelsea contract but money elsewhere will not be a deciding factor. Nor will location, having been all over the country in six loan moves. ‘I was saying to my mate the other day: “I think I could drive round the whole country, no problem.” I've been to Bournemouth on the South Coast; Oldham, that’s Manchester; Norwich, the far east of the country; Reading, towards the west country; Nottingham, the East Midlands; and Birmingham, West Midlands. ‘I’m looking forward to getting settled for the first time. It'll be purely about playing football.’ Lion's roar! Bertrand (C) wants to build on his England career, which has seen him earn two caps so far . It was all about playing on the biggest stage two years ago. But his mum Debbie nearly did not travel to Munich. ‘I had given away my tickets and told her there was no point in her coming out, my chances of playing were at best slim,’ says Bertrand. ‘She ended up booking the flight anyway without me knowing. It must have been mothers’ intuition. Imagine if I'd played the final and she's been stuck at home – I'd never have lived it down. ‘That January there was talk of a move to Newcastle, then Di Matteo took over. That’s football. It can change at a drop of a hat. That’s why I always say, “Make sure you're training, make sure you're ready.”'","Ryan Bertrand rose to fame after helping Chelsea win the 2012 Champions League .

"By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . Aljaz Bedene, the Slovenian tennis player who wants to switch to Great Britain, faces both a bureaucratic wrangle and potential hostility from new compatriots if he wants to achieve his aim. After more than a year weighing things up, the Hertfordshire-based world number 108 has decided he would like to go for full British status and one day represent GB in the Davis Cup. But first he must secure a passport, not to mention convince other British players that he is not just carpetbagging, having played for Slovenia as recently as February 2012. New arrival: Aljaz Bedene is yet to receive a British passport but his decision to apply has caused a stir . Dan Evans, the UK number two, quickly took to Twitter to express his disapproval of the idea, saying (before he deleted it) 'So a guy becoming British who has already played for his country, doesn’t sound right to me.' The Lawn Tennis Association issued a non-commital statement: 'He is currently progressing with his citizenship application which will take some time, and in the meantime he will continue to base himself in Hertfordshire.' Bedene could, theoretically, be available for GB’s opening World Group Davis Cup match next March, although sources suggest that is highly optimistic, and that it is possible he may not get a passport at all. The 24 year-old has been ranked as high as 72 and, while unlikely to have a stellar career like another famous import Greg Rusedski, is a solid performer who looks to have a decent career in front of him. Ticket to success: The Slovenian wants to join Britain's Davis Cup team in the years to come . Challengers: The likes of Evans (left) and Edmund (right) could still be ahead of Bedene in the reckoning . He can play well on clay but has also had some decent results on grass while this year he reached the third round of the Sony Open in Miami on hard court. Currently injured with recurring wrist problems, he is expected to miss the French Open and concentrate on the grass court events that follow. Ironically, in his most recent outing at a Challenger in Italy he lost to Britain’s leading prospect Kyle Edmund, but in theory he would slot in as British number two with his current ranking. Bedene has based himself near Stevenage since 2011 and lives with his girlfriend Kimalie, a singer who is part of Slovenia’s answer to the Spice Girls, ‘Foxy Teens’. Realistically it is hard to see him gaining consideration for Davis Cup play for at least a couple of years, and then he would have to fit in to what has become a tight-knit unit under captain Leon Smith. Unit: Leon Smith (left) has built a close-knit team around Murray (centre) and Evans (right) Progress: The GB team that took on Italy in the Davis Cup quarter-final was the most successful for decades . Imports: Konta (far left) is the current women's number three while Rusedski (right) enjoyed a stella career . While tennis is hardly unique among British sports in accepting incomers it has had its share over the past 20 years. Olympic silver medallist Neil Broad from South Africa and current women’s number three Jo Konta have been high profile examples, with 1997 U.S Open finalist Greg Rusedski the most prominent of all. The most recent was Australian Brydan Klein, who qualifies through an English mother, although his career remains stuck in neutral. Novak Djokovic once contemplated trying to qualify on residency, tempted by such things as assistance from the LTA and potentially lucrative sponsorships, although he eventually thought better of it. The process is rarely smooth although Rusedski is someone who has stayed around and, more than fifteen years on, become very much part of the British scene.","Bedene played for the country of his birth as recently as 2012 .

"By . Martin Hardy . and Simon Jones . There are few clubs in the Premier League who want to see the back of this season more than Newcastle United. They have struggled for form since the turn of the year, their fans staged a protest walkout against owner Mike Ashley and manager Alan Pardew last week and the local paper is campaigning for the  manager to be sacked. Dysfunctional would be an understatement for this club. Liverpool, needing a win to keep any faint title hopes alive, could not ask for better opponents at Anfield on Sunday. Feeling the heat: Newcastle boss Alan Pardew is under pressure from the fans after his team's poor season . Making their point: Newcastle fans display a banner in protest against Pardew and owner Mike Ashley during last week's 3-0 win over Cardiff . Not impressed: Newcastle fans let Ashley and Pardew exactly how they felt during last week's win over Cardiff at St James' Park . The verbal abuse was so strong during last week’s 3-0 victory over Cardiff, which ended a run of six straight defeats, that Pardew did not leave the home dug-out. Two thousand fans, aggrieved by the lack of signings and bad results, walked out after 69 minutes, chosen because the last time the club won a trophy, the Fairs Cup, was in 1969. The contrast could not have been more stark this week as Ashley marched in his Sports Direct staff for the company’s annual conference of free beer and games. Newcastle will finish the season in the top 10, with at least eight points more than last season, triggering a staff bonus and most likely keeping Pardew in a job. Pardew will meet the owner for talks next week but the club distanced themselves from reports on Friday that they have made an approach for St Etienne manager Christophe Galtier, with sources claiming the 47-year-old Frenchman had been offered to them. Asked if he expects to be Newcastle boss next season, Pardew said: ‘I hope so. There was a lot of frustration and I understand that. Hopefully I can prove, as I’ve done at previous clubs, that I can come back stronger.’ Linked: Newcastle were reported to have made an approach for . St Etienne boss Christophe Galtier . Feeling the love: Pardew did find some fans who were keen to have an autograph before the Cardiff match but the majority are not keen on him . The fans want him out. Pardew is said to be devastated at the abuse he faced last week and will no doubt have noted the front page of the powerful Evening Chronicle on Tuesday: ‘Earth to Pardew, Go Now! Pardew’s case hasn’t been helped by the lack of investment in his squad. Ashley has not bought a player since January 2013 and the club’s best performer, Yohan Cabaye, was sold to Paris Saint-Germain in January. There have been problems among the players, too. After a 4-0 defeat by Manchester United last month, Hatem Ben Arfa was thrown out of the dressing room by a team-mate, and Sylvain Marveaux and Gabriel Obertan have not started a game this year. Going back home: Frenchman Yohan Cabaye joined Paris Saint-Germain in January from Newcastle . Troubled campaign: Newcastle winger Hatem Ben Arfa has endured a poor season . Out of favour: Gabriel Obertan, left, and Sylvain Marveax have not started a game for Newcastle this year . The three, who cost in excess of £10million, are unlikely to play again for the club. Those who have played have been poor. Only four teams have conceded more than Newcastle’s 57 goals and no team have won fewer points after going behind than their three. ‘In the second half of the season we have not been good enough,’ said Pardew, who still seems to bear mental scars from his infamous butt. ‘I’ve not been good enough. I let myself down on the touchline. I think I’ve made some calls this year where I could have been more positive tactically. It’s time for reflection.’ Fans are furious at Ashley’s refusal to spend money and chase Champions League football and cup success. They argue he is in a position to do so. Since the Sports Direct owner took control of  Newcastle in 2007 for £134m, the share price of his sports stores has rocketed from £1.60 to £7.70. In contrast, the club’s turnover in that period has fallen from £129m to £106m. Frugal owner: Ashley has come under fire from fans for his lack of investment in the team . Pardew let his frustrations show during an interview in October on Sky’s Goals on Sunday, hinting Ashley might sometimes hinder the club’s progress. ‘He loves football but he sometimes can’t understand how it works,’ said Pardew. ‘It confuses and upsets him, and when he is upset, he does things that aren’t brilliant for the club.’ Ashley was furious and Pardew’s position was in jeopardy, far more so than after events at Hull. He was warned about his conduct but survived. Ashley seems unmoved. This week he held the Sports Direct annual conference at St James’ Park. Employees played darts, whizzed remote-control cars around a track, played table football and watched cricketer Steve Harmison and Olympic curler David Murdoch in a version of a Question of Sport. There was a free bar and Ashley Roberts, once part of the Pussycat Dolls, sang to the delighted staff. Tyneside legend: Alan Shearer was voted as fifth most important Geordie of all time by Newcastle's local paper . Teams from all over the country played on the pitch as advertising hoardings rolled through a series of messages urging staff to make even more money. ‘The sign is red, the sign is blue, the £300m is there for you. Target for 2014-15 £300m, the three oh oh, here we go.’ ‘Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct Army. Another year another target smashed, bring on the next.’Ashley revelling in such success will surely rile Newcastle fans further. They feel Ashley is using the club, not helping it. Across town, a talk was being given on Colin Veitch, a former Newcastle captain listed as the fourth most important Geordie of all time in the local newspaper (Alan Shearer was fifth). Veitch helped Newcastle to three First Division titles, one FA Cup and another four FA Cup finals at the start of the 1900s. What this club would do for a sniff of a trophy now.","Newcastle have struggled for form since the turn of year .

The former Northern Ireland manager’s York side were just six points above the League Two relegation zone at the beginning of February but tonight embark on a play-off semi-final against big-spending Fleetwood Town. It’s been such a turnaround over the last three months that the Minstermen are 17 games unbeaten - with 13 clean sheets to boot - and go in as the form side. Turnaround: Worthington's York City have reached the playoffs in remarkable style . Not bad for a man whose remit when taking over at Bootham Crescent was to purely keep them afloat. Just three games now stand between them and the third tier. ‘Two weeks ago Brendan was on top of a mountain and everything was rosy, but it’s all changed,’ Worthington said. ‘They have almost gone from winning the league to losing it. I’m desperately disappointed for him.’ Worthington’s mum and Rodgers’ grandmother were sisters; the Liverpool manager has said that the cousin - 11 years his senior - was a major influence on his career. ‘We never seem to have the luxury of having a good night together,’ Worthington added. ‘The only time I see Brendan is on coaching courses because he’s a hell of a lot busier than I am because of Liverpool’s size. Family fortunes: Rodgers (left) looked glum after Liverpool's setbacks while Worthington (right) is happy at York . ‘You lose touch. You’re so focused on your own job. The amount of time football can take up in your life is amazing. I spend a lot of time at this club in League Two. God only knows what Brendan spends up there at the top of the Premier League.’ York’s rise cannot be understated, cannot be overlooked. It’s ten years this week since they played their final game in Division Three - against Swansea no less - before dropping down to the Conference. Seasons in the doldrums, serious financial woe and play-off disappointment followed until eventual promotion in 2012. Worthington took over last March, kept them up and hasn’t looked back. ‘We want to see how far we can push ourselves,’ the 52-year-old said. ‘Whatever is earned by the club gets put back in. It’s in black and white. I appreciate that. ‘The chairman [Jason McGill] is very committed to making sure the club is a part of the community. That’s very important to the city of York. That’s close to his heart, and rightly so.’ Worthington earned 66 caps for his country and played in a World Cup, revealing that he turned down two opportunities at clubs higher up the pyramid before plumping for York. He is self-aware and knows exactly what the drop from international management to England’s basement looks like. Perceptions don’t bother him. Step down: Worthington knows the move from international management to League Two surprised some . In the battle: York City's playoff dreams mean their season is still alive . ‘If you’re a football person and enjoy the game you shouldn’t feel embarrassed by it,’ he said. ‘You sometimes have to bide your time. Everybody wants to be as high as they can but it’s got to be right for you. I loved my time as Northern Ireland manager and had some really good results in that time. People wanted change and you get on with it. ‘We were close to qualifying for tournaments. It’d be huge if they ever did it because, no disrespect, they don’t have enough players at the top level. ‘I’m back out on the grass and working for good people at York City. When you add those things up, I’m a very happy man.’ Worthington will be even more gratified if he can deliver what would be an unthinkable promotion - not least to add some smiles to family faces.","York were in danger of relegation in February - now they are in the play-offs .

There are no such plaques commemorating the 19th century poisoning spree of Cotton, who claimed 21 victims and was hanged in 1873. On Saturday, West Auckland Town’s current crop of footballers – none of whom are coalminers, unlike the men who were two-time world champions – have the chance to write a new chapter in the village’s history when they venture to Wembley for the FA Vase final against Sholing of Hampshire. The history books could certainly do with a modern-day instalment. For it is the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy triumphs of over one century ago which remain the subject of bar-room banter at the West Auckland Working Men’s Club. Indeed, an exact replica of the cup is housed there, the original having been stolen in 1994 and never recovered. ‘The village is football, that’s what it’s all about and what it lives for,’ current West Auckland boss Peter Dixon told Sportsmail. There are five famous former residents; four were footballers and the other, infamously of course, was Cotton. Prize: West Auckland will be hoping to pick up their first piece of major silverware since the 1911 triumph . Up for the cup: Manager Peter Dixon (second left) is determined to bring glory back to West Auckland . One of those footballers, Tom Alderson, was born in the village in 1909, the same year West Auckland returned from Italy with their first ‘World’ crown (it was referred to as such because this was the first time clubs from different countries had competed against each other in a tournament). Alderson, incidentally, went on to play for his local side before making his name at Leeds United, Luton Town, Darlington and Chester City. By the time he was two years old, West Auckland were heading back to Turin to defend their title. There they beat FC Zurich of Switzerland 2-0 in the semi-final before humbling Italian giants Juventus 6-1 in the final. It wasn’t until they returned that the village folk were regaled with tales of their triumph. One hundred years on, the club were invited back to Turin where they faced a Juventus under-20 side, who served their belated revenge courtesy of a 7-1 victory. Opposition: Captain Byron Mason (left), manager Dave Diaper (centre) and Marc Diaper (right) or Sholing . Mystery, though, still surrounds the nature of their original invite to the competition in 1909, as Dixon explains: ‘They still talk about it now. One theory is that Woolwich Arsenal were invited but an admin error meant West Auckland, with the same initials, went instead. ‘Either way, the association with those World Cup victories certainly adds a little bit of prestige to the club. ‘Everyone in the village still talks about it and I’m reminded of it every day when I drive in and out. ‘And that’s brilliant, it should be celebrated, but we want to write our own bit of history now.’ West Auckland were beaten FA Vase finalists two years ago when Northern League rivals Dunston UTS returned to the region victorious. And Dixon – in charge since 2009 - reflected: ‘Wembley is an unbelievable stadium and a fantastic occasion and an incredible achievement just to get there. ‘But when you lose – as we did two years ago – everything is amplified. It’s never nice to lose any football match, but do it at Wembley means the heartache is ten times as bad.’ The 45-year-old went on: ‘I think the last time we went there we treated it a bit like a theme park. ‘I’m trying now to get the lads focused on the game, it’s a 90-minute match and that is their priority – not the stadium or anything else which goes with the day, that will come later. ‘To be honest, I’m terrified of losing but all I want the lads to do is turn up – we didn’t two years ago – and give it our best shot. I’ll take that.’ It is 51 years since West Auckland last lifted the Northern League Cup and the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy win remains their last success outside of regional competition. Dixon knows what victory this weekend would mean. Determined: The West Auckland leadership (right) are determined to succeed at Wembley this time . ‘There were over 100 people waving us off on Friday morning, and everyone else will be coming to the game,’ he added. ‘As I said, West Auckland is a football village, that’s what it is. The lads tell me there was a serial killer as well, but that’s it. ‘So there has been no history made in over 100 years and we’ve got the chance to change that. ‘We’ve had success since myself and my assistant Paul Foster took over, but we haven’t won anything. ‘We’re desperate now to bring back some silverware for the village, I’m sure the welcome party would be something special.’ They’ve waited more than 100 years to throw such a celebration. It is time to forget those World Cup heroes, if only for one night. Tickets for the 2014 FA Vase Final are available on the day at Wembley Stadium, priced £15 for adults and £5 for under 16s.","West Auckland Town beat Juventus in the first international club competition in 1909 .

Ross Barkley is the latest talent to come off the Everton production line and the club's Under 21s manager Alan Stubbs has seen the midfielder's remarkable rise first hand. Both boyhood Blues, 'Stubbsy' believes it was just a matter of time before Barkley made it and hopes the youngster is selected in Roy Hodgson's 23-man England squad for this summer's World Cup in Brazil. Sportsmail spoke to the Toffees coach about Barkley's breakthrough, Everton's up-and-coming academy stars and the club's famous 'School of Science'. One to watch: Ross Barkley is the latest talented youngster to come though the Everton production line . True Blue: Everton Under 21s manager Alan Stubbs spoke to Sportsmail about the club's impressive academy . Evertonians knew all about Ross Barkley before he burst onto the scene in the Premier League this season. Did you expect him to have such an impact? Yeah, I did (laughs). Ross has had a big impact. I coached him for two or three years and he always stood out and has fantastic ability. It has to be said the season he’s having comes two years on from breaking his leg. Ross may have made the breakthrough even earlier but for the injury. Whether it was this season or last, it was only a matter of time before he made it. Flying high: Stubbs hasn't been surprised by the huge impact Barkley has made at Goodison Park this season . Proud: Barkley, pictured with Graeme Sharpe (left), scooped Everton's Young Player of the Season award . Do you think Barkley will make into Roy Hodgson’s 23-man England squad this summer and help lead the nation to World Cup glory? For Ross to go to Brazil with England would be fantastic. How many 20-year-old lads can say they’ve been to the World Cup? For me, not only as an Evertonian but also as an England fan it would be good to see him selected – I’ve been waiting for England to win the World Cup since 1971! It’s Hodgson’s decision whether or not he’ll play and we have to respect that. International: Barkley has been tipped to make Roy Hodgson's England squad for this summer's World Cup . Everton have seen a number of talented youngsters make a name for themselves after coming through the ranks. Notably Wayne Rooney and now Barkley. What’s the club’s secret? I think the biggest thing is the infrastructure at the club – the scouting, coaching and development of players. I think you also need that ‘luck’ element, too, to have players like Rooney and Barkley. Everton’s record over the years and the number of players brought through speaks volumes. Tyias Browning was named Everton’s Under-21s Player of the Season at the club’s End of Season awards on Wednesday night. How close is he to breaking into the first-team? Tyias has progressed at a real rate of knots and I think he’s close. He just needs to keep doing what he’s been doing and has a great opportunity of breaking into that first-team. Once a Blue, Always a Blue: Wayne Rooney began his career with Everton before moving to Manchester United . Progress: Stubbs believes young defender Tyias Browning is close to breaking into the Everton first-team . Young midfielder Ryan Ledson also picked up an award and was named Academy Player of the year... Ryan’s the baby, he’s only 16 but has been a real credit to himself. He’s made a few appearances for the Under 21s this season and for us that’s a bonus. Sometimes you can be a bit cautious about the impact playing in those games can have but, physically, he’s coped. It bodes well. Ryan’s one of a number of bright young players at Everton. Real credit: Everton's Ryan Ledson is one of a number of bright young players coming through the ranks . Meanwhile, Seamus Coleman scooped the main awards being named Player of the Season as well as the Player's Player award. Aged 20 when he joined the club in 2009, the Republic of Ireland international has had an excellent campaign... In all honesty, nobody in their wildest dreams could have envisaged what Seamus has gone on to achieve when we first signed him for £60,000 from Sligo Rovers. All credit to Everton for scouting him. The club took a chance and he’s been a revelation. He’s a modern day full back; can score goals, attack and is a real handful. All smiles: Seamus Coleman is congratulated by Steven Pienaar after winning Player's Player of the Season . Class act: Coleman is a modern day full back, scoring goals and being able to attack, according to Stubbs . Everton have had to deal with a number of injuries towards the end of this season meaning Browning, Ledson and Luke Garbutt have all made appearances on the bench. What advice do you give the younger players when they’re given the nod? I tell them to go and enjoy it but to not forget the reasons which got them there. The fact you’re on the bench doesn’t mean you’ve made it. It’s the first step in a long process. You don’t stop learning in football until the day you retire. With Duncan Ferguson, Kevin Sheedy, David Unsworth and yourself all coaching at the club's Finch Farm training ground, there is a real core of Blues legends currently back working at Everton. Do you think this benefits the club's young players? I think it can only be beneficial to see the likes of Sheedy (Under 18s manager), Ferguson (first-team coach), Unsworth (Under 21s assistant) and myself working at the club. We’ve been there, done it, lived the dream and it goes a long way. We’re not just there on a name alone, though. We have to be good coaches and are there because we’re doing something right. Club legend: Duncan Ferguson is a hero at Goodison Park and became an Everton first-team coach this season . Making a point: Former Everton defender David Unsworth (left) is assistant to Stubbs with the Under 21s . Helping hand: Stubbs believes having legends like Kevin Sheedy as coaches benefits the club's young players . You spoke to Everton chairman Bill Kenwright in the summer about the vacant manager’s job before Roberto Martinez was appointed as the club’s new boss... Yeah, I spoke to the chairman and we had an informal chat. It’s an ambition of mine and something I want to do in the future and I will be a manager one day. Everton have enjoyed a brilliant season under Martinez despite some fans being worried when the Spaniard first arrived at Goodison Park. Did you expect the club to perform so well this season? I think you can be a bit wary when a new manager comes in and have to expect a bit of a transitional period. We could have perhaps looked and thought: ‘We’ll take eighth place, aim for a top ten finish,’ but we’re fifth and the manager has done very well. Impressive: Roberto Martinez has enjoyed an excellent campaign during his first season as Everton manager . Ambition: Stubbs insists he will go into club management one day having been interviewed for the Everton job . Talks: Stubbs had an informal chat with chairman Bill Kenwright before Martinez was appointed as boss . Evertonians have often been heard singing ‘The School of Science, is on its way back’ this season, harking back to the positive brand of football played by past Everton sides. Do you try to get the youngsters playing 'the Everton way', too? We always want the lads to play football. We’ve never been direct and instead try to play. That philosophy has always been part of the club but I think Martinez has reinforced it. The players are playing in a positive environment and we try to educate them. At Everton, the ‘School of Science’ was always at the forefront during the 60s, 70s and 80s and now it’s back. Hopefully we can maintain it in the 21st century. With Martinez at the helm and the talented youngsters coming through, how far can Everton go? It’s difficult to put a finger on it but we have to aim to get as high as we can. We’ve made good strides this season and have some fantastic players at the club. Moving in the right direction: Stubbs believes Everton have made great strides and have some fantastic players . School of Science: Everton fans have unfurled this flag at recent matches, reveling in the club's exciting play . Alan Stubbs was speaking at a Barclays Thank You Day event, where two amateur football teams were given the opportunity to play at Everton's Goodison Park by Barclays. This season Barclays is thanking fans, community heroes, players and managers for making the Barclays Premier League what it is.

"By . Matt Barlow . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . Kenny Sansom pulls a story from the archives; one from the days when he was the undisputed best left back in England. ‘It was many moons ago,’ said Sansom with a smile. ‘I was at the PFA Awards dinner when this guy from Wealdstone came up and asked me if I’d mind saying hello to their left back, Stuart Pearce. He said it would give him a big boost, so I said, ‘‘No worries’’. ‘I said, ‘‘Hello Stuart, how you doing’’ and all that. Then, as I’m walking  away, this fella’s whispered to me, ‘‘That lad’s going to take your place one day, Ken’’. ‘I’d had a couple of beers and I said, ‘‘Yeah, right’’. And he did. Plenty to offer: Kenny Sansom believes Ashley Cole can do well for England at the World Cup . ‘He took my place at a time when I wasn’t in the first team. George Graham had dropped me at Arsenal and Bobby Robson phoned me at home and said he couldn’t pick me while I wasn’t in the first team. ‘I said, “Fair enough, thanks for  calling”. It happened quite sharpish really.’ Sansom played 86 times for his country and went to four major tournaments as the first-choice left back for Ron Greenwood and Sir Bobby. He has suffered addiction problems since retiring but is back in work and getting his life in order. Stepping up: Leighton Baines is expected to go to the World Cup and could be first choice left back . The only full back to play more games for England is Ashley Cole, who has 107 caps, but the 33-year-old has lost his place in the Chelsea team this season and must wait to find if that has cost him a place in Roy Hodgson’s squad. Hodgson will select his 23 players plus those on standby on Monday, and he must choose left backs from Cole, Leighton Baines and Luke Shaw. ‘Ashley hasn’t played that much this season and I feel maybe he’s started to doubt himself for  the first time since he was very young,’ said Sansom. ‘The flip side is that he might be fresher and well rested. Young star: Southampton's Luke Shaw is a possible contender for the England squad . ‘Leighton Baines is a better crosser, no doubt in my mind, and he can be  dangerous from a free-kick. Set pieces and crosses can be so important in big matches, when it’s tense. He’s also  comfortable taking a penalty. I’m not sure if Ashley is after missing the last one.’ Sansom added: ‘These days, the full back position is more about helping your centre half and going forward. They don’t stop as many crosses as they did, but I don’t think there are as many wingers trying to come at you. ‘The modern full back has to create on the ball. They don’t knock it long from full back, like they did. They get forward and cross the ball as much as wingers. That was more my sort of game; I loved to attack. Ever present: Kenny Sansom won 86 caps for England before he lost his place at Arsenal and was dropped . ‘Luke Shaw is exciting. He has ability and aggression. More than the other two, who tend to go wide on to their left foot, he can go either way. He can come inside and use both his feet. He’s a little bit  different. He’s younger and he’s going to be keener. ‘I’ve a sneaking feeling that Roy wants to take Shaw and I cannot honestly see him taking all three, that’s wasting a place. Personally, I’d take Cole and Baines. Ashley’s a good strong defender and Leighton’s got that lovely delivery. I’d play Cole when you have to defend and Baines if you think they’re not so strong down the right. ‘Luke Shaw is an excellent player but he’s for the future. He is one for the Euros.’ Psycho: Stuart Pearce replaced Sansom as England's left back in the late 1980s . Southampton defender Shaw, 18, has played once for England, making his debut as a half-time substitute replacing Cole in the friendly against Denmark in March. Was it the symbolic passing of the left back’s torch? ‘Luke will know, if he’s picked, that he probably won’t start at the World Cup,’ said Sansom. ‘If that happens, he’s got to look up to Baines or Cole and say to himself, “I want to be better than you”. ‘From the age of 18, every season you should add something to your game. It might be that you read the game a little bit better. It might be learning to time your jump. It could be the smallest thing, but it’s important. ‘I used to watch Ashley when he came into the Arsenal side and he’d get caught on the inside trying to tackle with his left foot, going across his body. He gave a few penalties away like that, but he worked on it until he could tackle with his right foot. ‘Whenever he had a slight problem, Ashley worked hard at it. That’s the attitude that’s got him 100 caps. Without it, there’s no way he’d have got 100 caps. He’s worked hard. ‘I think Glen Johnson went through a period when he thought he’d arrived and he didn’t play so well, then he went to Portsmouth and realised he had to pull his finger out because he hadn’t quite made it yet. He’s improved from there to become a very good full back.’","Sansom believes Cole will be fresh for the World Cup after not playing much this season .

Rafael Nadal swept into the last four of the Madrid Open after beating Tomas Berdych 6-4, 6-2 on Friday to set up a semi-final against the tournament's surprise package, unseeded Spanish compatriot Roberto Bautista Agut. World number one Nadal has not been his dominant best on his favoured clay this year, losing in the quarter-finals in Monte Carlo and Barcelona, but had a relatively easy ride against the outclassed Czech sixth seed, whom he has now beaten 18 times in 21 meetings on all surfaces and 17 times in a row. The defending champion in the Spanish capital, Nadal broke the Berdych serve three times without losing his own and, with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic withdrawing and Andy Murray knocked out on Thursday, remains firmly on course for a fourth Madrid Masters crown. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Nadal take on the world's best female poker player . King of clay: Rafael Nadal eased past Tomas Berdych to reach the Madrid Masters semi-finals . Shock to the system: Nadal will face unseeded surprise package Roberto Bautista Agut in the last four . Nadal said his performance was probably his best of the clay swing, good news for the Mallorcan as he gears up for a tilt at a record-extending ninth French Open crown later this month. 'My play is good when I'm hitting my forehand well, especially on clay,' said Nadal, who is vying for his third title in the Spanish capital. 'In Monte Carlo I used my backhand more and not my forehand, and when I have to hit five or six backhands in a row it doesn't help my game.' 'It was a match with a lot of intensity and perhaps it was my toughest match until now in the tournament,' Nadal told a news conference. 'To make it to the semi-finals for the first time in the clay season here in Madrid is great news for me,' added the 27-year-old, who is chasing a 63rd career title and a 44th on clay. 'I just managed to go over a barrier in the quarter-finals with a complex opponent. No 1 fan! Real Madrid winger Gareth Bale braved the hot weather to watch Nadal win . Columbian connection: Monaco striker Radamel Falcao was also at the game while he recovers from injury . 'I've been two weeks without doing that and I'm happy for that. Now I just need to make an extra effort. 'I have to keep on going along the line that I've been going, which is each day a little bit better.' 'I brought great energy and intensity to it and that's the best news, that it's my best (on clay) yet,' Nadal said. 'The things that, historically, I've done well on this surface I managed to do them again today.' Bautista Agut, ranked 45, had never reached the last eight of a Masters event before this week and continued his dream run with an efficient performance against Murray's conqueror, 46th-ranked Colombian qualifier Santiago Giraldo. A promising soccer player in his early teens, the unheralded 26-year-old Bautista Agut has two top 10 wins this year, defeating number five Juan Martin Del Potro at the Australian Open and Berdych in Indian Wells.","Rafael Nadal eased past Tomas Berdych 6-4, 6-2 to reach the Madrid Open semi-finals .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Computer-generated models of individual patients helping doctors map the progression of diseases and test the outcome of potential treatments could revolutionise  the NHS, scientists have claimed. A team of academics at the University of Sheffield are working on cutting-edge technology to allow medics tailor the use of treatment and drugs to each case. The work, due to be showcased at the university tomorrow, is being touted as a potential saviour to the struggling NHS. The pioneering technology could replace clinical trials currently taking place in vitro - in a test tube, and those in vivo - in a living organism. New technology, which is being pioneered at the University of Sheffield and creates computer-generated models of individual patients could revolutionise the NHS, helping doctors map the progression of diseases and test the potential outcome of treatments . The Virtual Physiological Human Project study aims to offer a better healthcare system with more personalised treatment plans, where results of various procedures can be potentially predicted in advance . The new method, in silico, allows scientists to build a sophisticated computer simulation model from a patient's own personal data. Known as the Virtual Physiological Human Project, the study aims to offer a better healthcare system with more personalised treatment plan, where results can potentially be predicted in advance. Pioneered at the university's Insigneo Institute for in silico Medicine, the technology models and simulates human physiology and . disease processes, to improve outcomes in cancer, heart disease, brain . surgery and many other conditions. The ultimate aim of the project is to build a complete computerised model of the human body with a view to predicting patients' future health status. Insigneo Director Professor Marco . Viceconti of the University’s Department of Mechanical Engineering said: 'Can you imagine weather forecasting without computers nowadays? More than 0 academics and clinicians are already developing computer simulations of disease processes that can be used directly in clinical practice to improve diagnosis and treatment . 'In the . same way that computers revolutionised weather forecasting, in silico . medicine is bringing computers at the heart of healthcare; they will . make possible to individualise the treatment, improve the care, and . reduce the costs.' At the Institute, more than 80 academics and . clinicians are already developing computer simulations of disease . processes that can be used directly in clinical practice to improve . diagnosis and treatment. Dr Keith McCormack who works on the project, highlighted the importance of the research. He said: 'Candidly, without in silico medicines (computer simulated), organiasations like the NHS will be unable to cope with demand' Dr Keith McCormack who leads business development at the Institute said: ‘What we are working on here will be vital to the future of healthcare. ‘Pressures are mounting on health and treatment resources worldwide. 'Candidly, without in silico medicines (computer simulated), organiasations like the NHS will be unable to cope with demand. 'We're delighted that the Sheffied team is leading the way with this research. This is a real breakthrough for patients' - Dr Julian Gunn, Consultant Cardiologist at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals . 'The Virtual Physiological Human will act as a software-based laboratory for experimentation and treatment that will save huge amounts of time and money and lead to vastly superior treatment outcomes.’ Dr Julian Gunn, a Consultant Cardiologist . at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and a Senior . Lecturer at the University of Sheffield’s Department of Cardiovascular . Science, said: 'Heart disease remains one of the world’s biggest . killers, so we’re delighted that the Sheffield team is leading the way . with this research. 'Any patient with coronary heart disease who . has an angiogram can, in the future, have a computerised assessment of . the significance of their disease. 'This will enable the cardiologist or . surgeon to know where to place a bypass graft or stent, without any . further tests, so this is a real breakthrough for patients. Dr Julian Gunn, a Consultant Cardiologist at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We're delighted that the Sheffield team is leading the way with this research...This is a real breakthrough for patients' 'The . technology will further improve the diagnosis, reducing the need for . some patients to have more invasive tests afterwards. 'It will also help . doctors decide which arteries need treatment - even which bits of which . arteries - and will guide therapy.' A prototype computer system capable . of detecting which heart patients need treatment is already in use in . the Sheffield region. It works by creating a 3-D model of the coronary . arteries during an angiogram - where multiple X-rays of the arteries are . taken - and reduces the need for further invasive tests and procedures. Dr McCormack, (pictured), added: 'The Virtual Physiological Human will act as a software-based laboratory for experimentation and treatment that will save huge amounts of time and money and lead to vastly superior treatment outcomes' When complete the virtual human will be the most sophisticated application of computing technology in healthcare. A showcase of the work to date due to take place tomorrow in Sheffield will demonstrate the role the technology could play in treating diseases like Parkinson’s Disease, pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease. The technology could also be used in managing the care of osteoporosis sufferers by using models of the patient’s body to chart disease progress and predict fracture risk. The Insigneo Institute leading the work is a collaborative between the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and the University of Sheffield. The programme is backed by European Commission funding.","Scientists at University of Sheffield are developing cutting-edge software .

But two professionals from Hawaii have braved the destructive power of nature by capturing the moment when lava flows into the sea – from the water. CJ Kale and Nick Selway claim to be the first to bring this unique view of lava flow from the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii to the world. The power of nature: The photographers swam in 110 degree water just 20 feet away from the eruption (pictured) so they could get closer for short bursts - but would have to swim back right away to get into cooler water and recover . They had to enter the water within feet of where the lava was running into the surf, braving the scalding water and dodging ‘lava bombs’ floating towards them. ‘We swam in 110°C water just 20 feet away we could get closer for short bursts but would have to swim back right away to get into cooler water,' Mr Kale told Fotoflock. ‘The sand is not really sand it is more like glass and the water is filled with volcanic glass and lava bombs,’ which he explained are chunks of lava that are hot and float around on the water’s surface until they cool and sink. ‘We both came out of the water pretty cut up but it was worth it to capture a view that has not been done before,’ he said. Brave: The intrepid duo had to enter the water within feet . of where the lava was running into the surf, braving the scalding water . and dodging ‘lava bombs’ floating towards them. On the left, liquid lava streams into the steaming sea and on the right the light from the glowing rock is reflected on the surface of a wave . Close shave: The photographers have suffered burns for getting so close to their fiery subjects (pictured). CJ Kale said: 'Each volcano photo I capture is truly a unique moment in time never to be captured the same again' The pair are able to capture dangerous sites and situations together which they say are too risky to enter into alone. They had to wait five years for the right conditions to photograph the eruption. Of course their endeavour to snap the perfect picture is incredibly risky and in 2011 Mr Kale shattered his ankle by falling into a ‘lava tube’. Mr Selway had to rescue his friend using a camera bag and tripod as they had no rope and construct a make-shift splint from a tripod leg and belt to help him walk the mile-and-a-half back to the car. Mr Kale write on his Facebook page: ‘I have been asked many times why I take such extreme risks for my photography. Here is the reason why. I don't want to make fake photos on the computer but I have to compete with people who do.’ Hot property: CJ Kale and Nick Selway claim to be the first photographers to bring a unique view of lava flow from the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii to the world - from the surf near the erruption (pictured) Risky but worth it: Mr Kale said: ‘I have been asked many times why I take such . extreme risks for my photography. Here is the reason why. I don't want . to make fake photos on the computer but I have to compete with people . who do.’ The violence of an eruption and a snaking flow of lava is pictured on the left, while a rainbow frames a trickle of lava running down rock into the sea on the right . ‘So to make my images stand out in a world of photoshopped falsehoods I need to take extreme risks to capture things that haven't been done before. ‘I do it so I can support my family off of my art. I love being a father and I want the best for my kids. I am willing to go to the ends of the earth to give it to them. But what father isn't.’ Mr Kale and Mr Selway use SPL surf housings to keep the water out of their specialist Canon 5D Mark2 cameras. Mr Kale was brought up on the Waianae Coast in Hawaii and told Gizmodo: ‘There is no other place in the world that you can photography within feet of where you stood the day before and capture such dramatically different images. ‘Each volcano photo I capture is truly a unique moment in time never to be captured the same again.’ The photographers both live in Kailua Kona and run the Lava Light Gallery together. Dodging bombs: While the water might look clear in this picture, the photographers said the sand felt like glass and there were red hot 'lava bombs' floating in the sea that could have hurt them . Timing is everything: The duo are able to capture dangerous sites together which they say are too dangerous to do so alone.

"By . David Clough, Press Association . England had to negotiate 'borderline' conditions on their way to victory over Scotland in rain-drenched Aberdeen - but afterwards, captain Alastair Cook was in no doubt they were right to persevere. A half-century from Ian Bell, and then a one-day international career-best four for 41 for off-spinner James Tredwell, helped to deliver a 39-run success. Cook knows he, opposite number Kyle Coetzer and the umpires might easily have called time on a fixture which got under way five-and-a-half hours late and was then beset by even more rain which reduced it to a Twenty20 format. New era: Cook (right) called conditions 'borderline' as Peter Moores (left) started with a win . But after England had begun their new era under Cook and returning coach Peter Moores with a win, the visiting captain insisted everyone involved deserved congratulations for ensuring a sell-out crowd got the spectacle they too deserved. 'Those were borderline conditions to play in,' he said. 'But just in a one-off game, with not so much riding on it, I think it was the right decision. 'I think it would have been wrong if we hadn't - and credit to both sides for just getting on with it.' Cook might easily have left the field earlier than he did during a particularly heavy downpour, but stayed put after he and Bell (50) had shared an opening stand of 83. He therefore helped to buy enough time to make sure a result was possible. 'Those conditions are as wet as I have ever fielded in,' he added. Eye on the ball: Cook made a partnership of 83 with Ian Bell before being dismissed for 44 . Just not cricket: The England captain said the conditions were 'as wet as I've ever fielded in' 'It probably wasn't fit to play, if you are being totally honest. 'I was in standing water at mid off, and there were other patches like that. But both sides just got on with it. 'I thought the way Scotland fielded, especially in those conditions, was exceptional.' England came through unscathed and with an opening victory to start a summer in which they need to put their miserable Ashes winter behind them as quickly as possible. 'I don't think it was dangerous, no - but it was pretty close to it,' said Cook. 'It was very wet for the bowlers running in, but we just about had enough grip to do it. 'People still threw themselves around in the field.' On top: Ian Bell, who made 50, was the only Englishman to really strike the ball cleanly . A short discussion with the umpires while Cook was batting brought the initial outcome that the players remained in the middle. 'We were asking 'How wet does it have to get?' I was actually going to ask for a towel to dry my grip, because I couldn't grip my bat. 'It looked like it was going to stop (raining), but we knew how dangerous it would be and that we might not get back on (in time). 'When the umps came and said 'Look, it's going to take a lot longer to mop up properly - but do you want to just get on with it?' Kyle and his team said 'yes'.' England fell foul later of local boy Michael Leask, whose 16-ball innings of 42 kept Scotland hopes alive in pursuit of a Duckworth-Lewis target of 173. 'He was dangerous, wasn't he?' said Cook. 'The only people who timed the ball were he and Belly, and they did it beautifully. Cameo: Leask's quickfire innings kept Scotland in with a chance before England secured the win . Celebrations: England's win was the perfect start for their new coach . 'He [Leask] has got a lovely swing of the bat - and when he hit it, it stayed hit. 'It was quite hard to keep getting after 'Tricky Treds' - he keeps pulling it back a little bit, even when the ball was extremely wet and he wasn't getting much grip on it at all. 'But he [Leask] was dangerous, and that's what Twenty20 cricket is about. One guy can win a game. 'It would have needed him to get 80 or 90 to do it ... but while he was still in, it was definitely a possibility.' Leask himself added: 'I'm quite a confident person when I go into bat. 'I know I can hit the ball quite cleanly...and if I am straight I usually connect quite well.' He did, but not for long enough to seriously discomfort England.","England win shortened game to give Moores a winning start .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A baby boy born with a rare condition causing parts of his skull to fuse required a four-hour lifesaving operation to reshape and replace parts of the bone, to allow his brain to grow. Alex Shoebridge was devastated when at a 32-week scan she was told her unborn child had the rare condition craniosynostosis. The condition caused sections of her son Saul's developing skull to fuse together. At nine months old he was taken into the operating theatre to undergo a four-hour procedure to put his skull back together. Saul Shoebridge was born with the rare condition craniosynostosis, which causes parts of the skull to fuse. Where the bone fuses it prevents growth, causing other parts of the skull to 'overgrow' to compensate and allow the brain to grow . At nine months old surgeons told Saul's mother Alex Shoebridge her son would require risky surgery to correct the condition, reshaping and replacing parts of the affected bone . The condition, which affects around one in every 3,000 children, had caused Saul's head to grow irregularly. Ms Shoebridge discovered her unborn son was suffering the condition at a 32-week scan scheduled because she was suffering preeclampsia - a potentially life-threatening condition . Ms Shoebridge, of Banchory, Aberdeenshire said: 'The fusing meant Saul's skull couldn't grow out sideways, only forwards. As a result he was developing quite an abnormally-shaped head. 'It meant his development was severely restricted in the first months. 'There was no choice but to let surgeons correct the problem. The operation wasn't free of risk - I was so nervous during the procedure that I couldn't think straight.' The trained midwife was told of her unborn son's condition after a 32-week scan, booked because the 42-year-old was suffering preeclampsia - a potentially life-threatening condition affecting pregnant women, caused by raised blood pressure that can lead to severe fits if untreated. She said: 'I was told one of Saul's cranial sutures - the breaks between the sections of his skull bone - had fused prematurely. 'He was the first baby from my area to have been born with it in seven years. 'Normally sutures are able to mould fairly easily as the baby is delivered from the birth canal and to help development, but for some reason, one of Saul's sutures had healed over. 'The fusing meant Saul's skull couldn't grow out sideways, only forwards. As a result he was developing quite an abnormally-shaped head' - Mother Alex Shoebridge . 'It was a serious concern because the brain needs room to grow.' Saul, whose older brother Jordan is 17, was born weighing 5lb 9oz on November 3, 2011. Ms . Shoebridge said: 'My first words when Saul came out were, ""my, you've . got a big head, haven't you?"" His body was quite small but his head was . large. 'I made sure he was . wearing a hat when Jordan came in to see him. I didn't want the first . thing Jordan noticed about his brother was how different he was. Ms Shoebridge, a trained midwife, said: 'The fusing meant Saul's skull couldn't grow out sideways, only forwards. As a result he was developing quite an abnormally-shaped head' Now two, Saul made a quick recovery from his operation, trying to sit up on his own for the first time just three days after the treatment . Crainosynotosis is a rare condition which causes a baby to be born with an abnormally shaped skull. A child's irregularly shaped head can cause headaches, learning difficulties and eye problems. Most symptoms develop later in childhood and usually result from increased pressure within the skull. The . condition is usually diagnosed after a doctor conducts a visual . examination of the skull, although further tests may be necessary.Why does it happen?Craniosynostosis is the result of premature fusion of different secions of the skull. It means the skull is unable to grown in affected areas. As . one area of the skull is restricted, other parts of a baby's head . 'overgrow' to compensate and limit the pressure developing around the . brain. The lack of growth in some areas and compensatory growth in others, often leads to a altered head shape.How common is the condition? Craniosynostosis is rare, affecting around one in every 1,800 to 3,000 children, according to NHS Choices. Three of every four cases affects boys.Treating craniosynostosis The primary treatment for the condition is surgery. The procedure can be carried out during the first year of your baby's life, or delayed until later in childhood. Most children recover well from the operation and the appearance of their skill improves significantly. However, . around one if 15 children may have on-going problems with their skull's . development as they get older. In these cases, often the child will . need further surgery to correct changes as they age. Source: NHS Choices . 'Saul was extremely slow to develop in the first few months while we awaited the date of the operation. He couldn't even sit up, because his neck muscles were too weak to support his head. 'I'd joined a Facebook group of mothers who were all expecting in the same month and it was upsetting to realise all their children were reaching milestones which Saul was nowhere near.' Surgeons at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Yorkhill, Glasgow, told Ms Shoebridge her tiny son required an operation to remove sections of his skull allowing them to reshape and replace the affected pieces of bone. They warned the mother-of-two her youngest child could suffer brain damage as a result of the treatment. She said: 'I was extremely nervous because the surgery was not without risk. 'I learned that in other hospitals some children had not survived, although it's extremely rare for that to happen. 'If bleeding starts, it difficult to stop. The consequences can be severe. 'We didn't have much of an option. If we left it any longer, then his brain would become severely restricted. 'Nevertheless, I made two return trips to hospital to talk to the surgeons before making my mind up. It turned out the surgeons were absolutely fantastic.' During the four-hour operation Saul did experience some bleeding and required an urgent blood transfusion. Ms Shoebridge said: 'I tried to keep my mind occupied while Saul was in theatre. 'After a while I went back up to the . ward to see if there were any developments. 'When I got there I noticed . that his cot had been taken away. I thought, ""my God, what's happened?"" 'It . turned out that the surgeons had simply requested for Saul's cot to be . taken to the operating theatre so he could be placed in it.' Saul made a quick recovery, attempting to sit up by himself for the first time three days after surgery. Ms Shoebrdige praised the 'fantastic' surgeons at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Yorkhill, Glasgow for saving Saul, pictured shortly after he was born in November 2011 . The . now two-year-old has since been diagnosed with a chromosomal deletion . disorder and developmental challenges which affects his ability to learn . to walk and crawl, and his sensory perception. Ms Shoebridge said: 'He's two-and-a-half now and he's only just started to walk, so he's got some way to catch up. His development only truly began after he had the surgery. 'He's a great little boy. He's extremely cheeky and laughs a lot, but he can be a monster too - a normal two year old, in other words. 'He's got a lot of challenges but he's doing well. I feel very supported. 'The consultants were amazing at the time of the surgery and I've got lots of specialists - speech therapists, physiotherapists and health visitors within reach.' Ms Shoebridge has found a network of support among other parents at the Facebook group of Headlines, a charity supporting families with craniofacial conditions in the UK and overseas. She said: 'When you're a parent facing these conditions it's easy to feel alone, but the truth is there are thousands of families out there who know what you're going through.'

"By . Ted Thornhill . The RSPCA is trying to find a dog owner who let the hair of a poodle-type pooch become so matted around her eyes that she went blind - and then left it in a box outside a vets with the message 'dog inside' scrawled on the front. Horrified vets that found the poor animal described the dog's ordeal as the ‘worst case’ of neglect they have ever seen. The elderly animal - which was extremely skinny - was abandoned outside a vets in Sheffield, south Yorkshire. Scroll down for video . Appalling neglect: Peggy's matted hair gave her agonising eye ulcers and she eventually went blind . Heartbreaking: Vets couldn't save Peggy's eyesight and decided that removing them and sewing her eyelids shut was their only option . When staff opened up the box they found a dog who was unable to blink. The matted hair had led to agonising eye ulcers, which had caused her to go blind in both eyes. She also had a mouth full of rotten teeth, damp feet from standing in her own excrement and was severely malnourished. Anne Bernabe, 35, who works at Highfield Veterinary Centre, said: ‘We were all horrified by what we saw when we opened the box - it was extremely upsetting to see. ‘It’s definitely the worst case of neglect any of us have ever witnessed in our entire careers, it’s just unimaginable how anybody could do this to a defenceless, elderly animal.’ The pooch, thought to be between eight and 13-years-old, was found by staff at around 8am on the morning of April 28 - and it is thought she had been dumped some time after 12pm on the Sunday. Saved: Molly Graham with Princess Peggy the poodle, who is now recovering well . She was immediately rushed inside, washed, trimmed, and fed-up on regular dog food. Sadly, her eyes were so badly damaged that vets decided they would have to be removed entirely. Three days after her arrival - and once she had been ‘fed up’ with lots of dog food and treats - she had both eyes removed and her eyelids sewn shut, as well as having her 32 rotten teeth removed. Vet Molly Graham was so upset by what had happened to the dog - now named Princess Peggy - that she has been fostering her. Molly said: ‘She is such a sweetie and all the staff were so upset by what has happened to her - but she is doing amazingly well despite her ordeal. New beginning: Vet Ms Graham said Princess Peggy is 'doing amazingly well despite her ordeal' ‘It is clear the dog had been in this condition for a while and the hair over her eyes was so matted that both eyes had ulcerated causing blindness.’ The incident has been reported to the RSPCA and inspector Jennie Ronksley is now looking into it. She said: ‘It is horrific to think this poor elderly girl has been left in such a terrible condition and she must have been in so much pain. ‘There is simply no excuse for allowing an animal to get in this way and I am now appealing to anyone who has any information regarding who the owner may be. ‘I really want to find the person responsible for this and I would appeal to anyone who has any information to call me on the RSPCA inspector appeal line on 0300 123 8018.’","Vets at a Sheffield practice found a dog in a box outside the building .

Melissa Beer, 23, from Derby, suffered years of torment from bullies about her size 22 frame but it was passion for a career at sea that finally helped her slim down. She put a stop to years of binge eating after discovering that she needed to weigh less than 11st to pursue her dream to enroll in the Royal Navy. Scroll down for video . Melissa, pictured before the weight loss, suffered years of torment from bullies about her size 22 frame . Melissa has dropped from 15st 9lb and size 23 (left) to 10st 12lb and a size 10 - 12 (right) Determined, she signed up for a gruelling boot camp to get herself into shape - and dropped from 15st 9lb to a slinky 10st 12lb - slipping into a size 10 - 12 dress. Melissa, who is currently a clinical and optical assistant at an opticians, said: 'I've been big all my life and it made me so miserable. 'All I've ever wanted to do was join the Navy but I knew I was always too big to even consider it - I would never make it past the fitness test. 'By the age of ten I weighed ten stone, when I was 11 I weighed 11st and the weight just kept creeping on. Having now passed her fitness test Melissa will be starting her Navy training this month . Write caption he . 'I was emotionally bullied so much at school that my mum would have to force me to go and I would come home crying every day. 'It's really sad that people don't allow themselves to get to know you, they just see what's on the outside and laugh and ridicule you for the way you look. Melissa struggled with her weight throughout her childhood and as a result was subjected to emotionally and even physical bullying by her peers . 'On one occasion I was leaving school when a boy ran up behind me and kicked me so hard in the back for no reason. I just kept walking and didn't allow myself to cry until I had reached the car.' Melissa was subjected to bullying and horrible taunts for years which resulted in her having low self confidence . It wasn't until Melissa's sister, Amy, encouraged her to go to the Derbyshire based Booticamp Babes, which was set up in 2012, that she finally began to lose weight. 'A few years ago my feet were hurting so I sat down on the pavement to rest them when a group of lads walked past laughing saying 'It's funny because she's fat.' Melissa always dreamed of joining the Navy, but knew her unhealthy eating habits and size would prevent her passing the fitness tests . 'I was so hurt I cried all the way home. 'I know I was big, I didn't like to wear jeans as when I walked my legs would rub together and they used to be red and covered in sores, but it was so horrible to be judged in such a horrible way. 'One day my sister told me she had joined a new weight loss group called Booticamp Babes and encouraged me to go with her, I was sceptical at first but it was the best thing I ever did. 'I signed up for just a week which was free to begin with, but I loved every minute and couldn't wait to go back.' In order for Melissa to join the Navy she knew she would have to be fit and complete numerous touch physical challenges. Melissa used to go out drinking three or four nights a week (left)  but during her weight loss cut out  alcohol completely, beating her original weight loss targets (right) Melissa's original aim was to weigh less than 13st but after smashing that target she decided to lose even more. 'I was put on an eating plan and swapped all my junk food for healthy fresh food and went to at least three fitness classes a week. 'I used to go out three or four times a week and have a drink but I completely cut alcohol out as it would only delay my progress. And the hard work paid off as Melissa is now enrolled in the Navy's basic training course after passing the fitness test she thought she'd never be able to complete. 'I knew the fitness test would be hard but I wanted more than anything to complete it, I had to run 1.5 miles in less than 13 minutes and 15 seconds, complete swimming tests and a series of sit-ups . 'I was ecstatic when I achieved what I'd set out to do.' Melissa, pictured here with one of the camps trainers  decided to sign up to a new weight loss group called Booticamp Babes . Melissa will be going to Plymouth on May 25 and will be leaving her Booitcamp Babes behind but will be back to visit. The Royal Navy's basic training lasts 10 weeks, after which Melissa will start a 19-week training course. She said 'I can't wait, I've waited so long for this so bring it on. I will keep going no matter what obstacles are thrown at me.' Sarah Whitehead, the founder of Booticamp Babes, said: 'We couldn't want any more for Melissa - she's such an inspiration and we are all so proud of her for achieving her dream.

"By . Steph Cockroft . Government officials made an embarrassing blunder by referring to the Falklands Islands as 'Malvinas' - the name given to them by the Argentinians. The Home Office was pulled into line by the Foreign Office after it was caught using the controversial name when sending a purchase order to the islands' capital Stanley. The mistake - which has been made by the Government before - meant the address said: 'Falkland Island Government, The Treasury, Stanley, . Falkland Islands (Malvinas).' Home Office officials sent a purchase order to the Falkland Islands, pictured, calling them by their Argentinian name 'Malvinas' - something which goes against the Government's own policy . The use of the term 'Malvinas' is an embarrassment because it goes against the Government's policy of always calling them the Falkland Islands. The use of the Spanish name is also a snub to . islanders - and Britain itself - because it could imply that the islands belong to . Argentina. something which has been in dispute for decades. But it is not the first time that Government officials have made the gaffe. The islands' government was forced to complain after it received an order addressed . to the 'Malvinas' in June 2013. This week, Labour MP Tommy Docherty - who has previously brought up the issue in Parliament -, tabled a question to foreign secretary . William Hague to ask why the blunder kept happening. According to official Parliament records, Mr Docherty asked whether the secretary of state would 'discuss the correct . use of the name Falkland Islands with the Secretary of State for the . Home Office'. Foreign Office minister Hugo . Swire told Mr Docherty that Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) officials had been in contact with the Home Office to 'remind them of . the appropriate terminology for the Falkland Islands'. He said: 'All Government . departments and agencies should refer to ‘the Falkland Islands’ in all . instances. Foreign secretary William Hague was asked why the blunders had been made. The Foreign Office said there was 'no ambiguity' on what the Falkland Islands should be called . 'There is no evidence that incorrect terminology has been used . other than in the isolated cases.' Mr Docherty had also asked Mr Hague in March what discussions he had led 'on the correct use of the name of the Falkland . Islands by Government departments', records show. Mr Swire again reported at that time that officials had been 'in contact' with the offending department to remind them of the . appropriate terminology. He said: 'No specific . cross-governmental guidance has been issued on this matter, but it is . clear that all Government departments and agencies should use the . correct name, which is of course the Falkland Islands.' On a previous occasion, he had said:  'There is no . ambiguity on this point. All Government Departments and Agencies should . refer to the Islands by their correct name, which is the Falkland . Islands.' The dispute over the islands blew up into a full-scale war after Argentina . invaded the Falklands on April 2 1982. The ensuing war lasted for 74 days, claiming the lives of 255 British military . personnel, 649 Argentinians and three Falkland Islanders. In . referendum in March 2013, which produced a 92 per cent turn out, 1,513 . islanders vote to retain their status as British overseas territory, . with just three voting against.","Home Office used the controversial name when sending purchase order .

"By . Sara Malm . Higher education reminds many of gruelling hours in the library, re-heating Pot Noodles and grubby student pubs. Additional culinary adventures are determined by what can be found in the supermarket’s reduced section rather than by what you fancy for dinner. However, the students at High Point University are having a rather different experience. Studying hard: A student relaxes in a hammock on the Disney World-style campus of High Point University in North Carolina which boasts a cinema, a first-class restaurant and an arcade . Tough times: When exam pressure gets too tough on High Point students, they can relax by the swimming pool. Or the hot tub. Or in the cinema . University utopia: The college experience at High Point is worlds away compared to what most university students enjoy during their years in higher education . The campus, located in High Point, North Carolina, has more resemblance to a theme park than a traditional university, and boasts amenities you are more likely to find at a high-end hotel than at a school. Aside from the jaw-dropping buildings, a result of more than $700million worth of refurbishing, the campus also has swimming pools, top-end sports facilities and a first-class restaurant where students can enjoy one free five-course meal per week. The cinema, which shows features straight out of the high-street movie theatres, does not only screen for free, but also offer students complimentary popcorn, sweets and soft drinks. Should students be so inclined, there is an arcade, a putting green, a sports bar and even an ice cream truck - all of this for no monies. High Point's 'Greek Village' - a $19million fraternity and sorority complex, ensures that hard-working students can relax in outdoor hot tubs. However, when that is not enough to combat exam stress, High Point brings in masseuses and puppy therapy. Shine on: The campus has been improved with the help of $700million in refurbishments . Not exactly noodles: At the on-campus restaurant 1924 PRIME, High Point students enjoy a five-course meal once a week . Good game: The campus also has an arcade - but not even the machines in the gaming hall costs the students anything . Fore: Students hoping to improve their short game need to look no further than the college's putting green . It is all thanks to the university’s president, Dr Nido R Qubein, a millionaire entrepreneur who took over the campus eight years ago. After managing to raise millions to clean up the campus and build new facilities, he now dedicates his life to leading the university. In a Biography Channel documentary about his journey, Jordan-born Dr Qubein says: ‘I'm in the business of planting seeds of greatness in the minds and also in the hearts and souls of our students.’ 'All the lessons I have learned in my life, I now bring them to a university campus.’ His work has not been for nothing, although tuition and living costs has gone up by 60 per cent, enrolment is up by 50 per cent and the average SAT score of students at High Point is ten per cent higher than eight years ago. Last year Dr Qubein told Business Week he plans improvements costing $2.1billion by 2020, including a new sports arena. Fresh paint: Although the exteriors of many of the buildings are historic, when Dr Qubein took over as president, they received complete interior refurbishments .

"By . Colin Maximin . and Michael Powell . A British man on a dream sailing trip to the Caribbean to celebrate his wife’s 60th birthday was shot dead by robbers who boarded the yacht and attacked the couple. Roger Pratt, 62, is believed to have been shot dead as he defended his wife Margaret from the gang of thieves in  St Lucia. The couple were half way through a year-long sailing trip to celebrate her milestone birthday when the yachting adventure ended in tragedy. Victims: Roger Pratt, right, was shot dead on his yacht in St Lucia, as he defended his wife Margaret, left, against a gang of robbers . It emerged last night that they had been forced to stay the night in the port of Vieux Fort after being denied clearance to leave by customs officials. Local police spokesman Anel Innocent said Mr Pratt was beaten up and shot after three armed men boarded the boat on Friday night. Officers were said to have then killed one of the suspects in a dramatic shoot-out which followed the murder, and arrested the suspects. Mr Pratt was rushed to hospital but died from his injuries. His wife was also taken to hospital with cuts and bruises and was later discharged. Detectives were understood to have taken a statement from her yesterday afternoon. Mr Innocent said yesterday: ‘We do not know the full facts about this case yet. We are trying to ascertain what happened and then to get to the bottom of it.' Remote spot: The couple's own photograph of the island's Marigot Bat, which they visited . ‘We can however confirm that the man died and that we will be conducting a full post-mortem examination which will reveal the cause of death.’ Just days earlier, the couple had celebrated Mrs Pratt’s 60th birthday with a meal out at a restaurant. They had posted pictures of their expedition around the Caribbean in an online blog to keep family and friends updated on their trip. The couple were keen sailors and had spent years planning their 12-month trip across the Atlantic and around the Caribbean. Before leaving the UK in July last year, Mrs Pratt wrote on her LinkedIn page: ‘Off travelling! The plan is to be in the Carribean for my 60th birthday in January 2014 .  .  . all a bit of a leap into the unknown.’ They had been in St Lucia since mid-December and were planning to leave the island on Thursday but could not get clearance from the customs authorities. Instead, they were forced to spend the night in Vieux Fort. In her latest blog entry, written just hours before her husband’s death, Mrs Pratt bemoaned local bureaucracy. She wrote: ‘So here we are in Vieux Fort, the most southerly port of clearance in St Lucia. ‘It’s very different.  There’s a port; an airport and no tourists – and so it’s a regular town. It’s determinedly normal. It has a lot of churches: I counted seven and is different from the Catholic north. It seemed more wealthy, and of course isn’t reliant on tourist bucks.’ Mr and Mrs Pratt ran their own financial consultancy business, Okra Associates, based in Cannock, Staffordshire. The couple were half way through a year-long sailing trip to celebrate her milestone birthday when the yachting adventure ended in tragedy . Mrs Pratt also held a series of high-profile jobs in the NHS, including chief executive and director of finance roles. They lived together in a large £700,000 detached home in the historic village of Moreton Morrell in rural Warwickshire. A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ‘We are aware of the death of a British National in St Lucia. ‘We are providing consular assistance to the family.’ In the affluent hamlet of Moreton Paddox near Stratford-on-Avon where the couple had lived neighbours spoke of their horror at what had happened. Lavinia O'Shaughnessy, who has known the couple 15 years, said: 'I just feel really upset because for something like that to happen to people who are so very nice is terrible - I wanted them to come back.' She added: 'They were going on a journey on their boat, sailing around the world. 'Roger wasn't about much because he was retired so he would be down on the Isle of Wight where it was moored at the time, getting it ready for their trip. 'They rented their house out a few months ago, then went off sailing.' Mrs O'Shaughnessy said: 'Margaret was very friendly - she'd pick me up at the end of the road to give me a lift into town if she saw me, she was that sort of person. 'She was very into her work. 'I miss her really, and I'm very sorry to hear about Roger.'","Roger Pratt, 62, was murdered on the Caribbean island St Lucia .

"By . Julian Robinson . You could be forgiven for thinking it was just a normal back garden with its well-kept lawn and trimmed hedgerows. But one buyer has clearly seen some added potential in this tiny courtyard plot in central London after they paid out a staggering £84,000 - even though it has no planning permission. The land, in Chelsea, is just 0.05 acres in size but after its sale is now worth the equivalent of £1.68 million per acre. This courtyard garden with no planning permission has been sold in Chelsea for a staggering £84,000 having been put on the market for just £28,000 . It was only expected to sell for around £28,000 - but ended up selling for three times this figure to a foreign buyer. The new owner will now have to sit on their £84,000 investment as it can’t be built on. For the same price they could have bought themselves a Grade II-listed one-bedroom flat in Wellington, Somerset. The sale has netted the land’s owner a quick profit of £31,000, after they bought it eight months ago for £53,000. Chris Coleman-Smith, head of auctions at Savills, said: 'Little bits of London, such as this, are in scarce supply and people want to get their hands on their own little piece of Chelsea. 'City environments can easily change and so this could be a very long term investment bought with grandchildren and inheritance in mind. Despite being just 0.05 acres, the tiny courtyard garden is in a prime location in Chelsea, close to Sloane Square, Knightsbridge and Kings Road . 'Who knows what it might be possible to do with it in 20 years time.' The patch of land is in a residential area close to upmarket shopping areas such as knightsbridge and Kings Road as well as Hyde Park and Sloane Square. Access into and out of the quaint courtyard garden is through two gates and is surrounded by buildings. Property valuation site Zoopla estimates the average property price in the area surrounding the garden, is £2,180,840 . The sale follows the £700,000 paid for a row of disused garages in Fulham. The six garages, in Parsons Green, London were sold in April for ten times their value, after sparking a bidding war when they went under the hammer. The garages, which each had a rental potential of £65 a month, were also sold without planning permission for development. But that did not deter interest, with a flurry of bids in what auctioneers have branded 'a first'. The anonymous buyer, who is understood to be a developer, secured the garages for £700,000 - four times the average English house price, and one-and-a-half times the value of a typical London property.","Small garden area in Chelsea, London, was only expected to sell for £28,000 .

Jared Hill, pictured with girlfriend Emily Jarrell, was diagnosed with testicular cancer last September and has been undergoing chemotherapy since to help combat the illness . Chemotherapy is vitally important to helping Jared combat cancer, but the treatment has also compromised his immune system and made him more susceptible to sickness.

Front panels of the rumoured iPhone 6 leaked online earlier this month, so it was only a matter of time before the back panel made an appearance. Photos of the supposed dummy moulds appear to show Apple's next device with a larger and thinner case than the current flagship iPhone 5S. They don’t hint at anything that hasn’t been seen in previous leaks, but they do add to a catalogue of evidence suggesting Apple is heading into Samsung’s territory with its new design. It is unclear where the moulds have come from - and they may not even relate to an upcoming Apple handset - but the position of the volume buttons and camera seem to mirror current models. None of the photos feature dimension information. Nowhereelse.fr said: ‘With its curved edges to frame these two buttons for adjusting the volume size, and the elongated protruding optical picture accompanied by a circular LED flash, this model shows that overall aesthetic lines and features recently revealed by multiple technical plans seems to turn confirm the design of the iPhone 6.’ Pictures claiming to be the front panel of Apple's upcoming device were leaked on Chinese site Weibo earlier this month. It similarly revealed what appeared to be the much-rumoured 4.7-inch screen, but reports also claim Apple is working on a 5.5-inch version and the rear casing may be either.

Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version. Up until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 6.18mm. This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 5.75mm. By comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 7.6mm, while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 7.5mm. Samsung's Galaxy S4 is 7.9mm thick, while the HTC One is 9.3mm. However, more recent models from Samsung and HTC were thicker than their predecessors. The Galaxy S5 is 8.1mm and the HTC One M8 is 9.4mm. According to iphone.fr, which first spotted the images, the dimensions of the screen lend credibility to the image. 'It features what may be (or not) an ""iPhone 6"" front face. 'By comparison with the iPhone 5, we estimate the height for the screen at 4.1 inches (10.7 cm) and a width around 2.35 inches (6 cm). 'This gives a ratio of width and height at 0.55, which is exactly the one found on the current iPhone 5 and a 4.7 diagonal length.' The rumours come amid claims Apple suppliers around the world are gearing up to produce the larger screens. Japan Display, Sharp, and South Korea's . LG Display have all been tapped to make the panels, and its thought they . will begin mass production ‘within weeks.’ If the rumours are true, both iPhone 6 screens will be larger than the current 4-inch panels on Apple's iPhone 5S and 5C models. Other leaked images, pictured left and right, were posted on Chinese social network Weibo in March and are thought to have been posted by an anonymous insider working at Apple supplier Foxconn. Although the images are blurry, they appear to show a rounded design and protruding camera, similar to that seen on the iPod touch . Larger iPhones, the subject of months of speculation, would mark yet another incremental tweak to the popular smartphone line and an attempt to catch up to rivals like Samsung and HTC. CEO Tim Cook, while promising only 'new product categories' for 2014, has played his cards close to his chest. Both iPhone 6 screens are expected to use in-cell touch panel technology - built into the screen and allowing for thinner construction than with standard touch panel films - that was introduced with the iPhone 5, sources said. A patent published last week suggested the iPhone 6 may have a holographic display. The files detail a display that appears to float 3D images, or holograms, above it, and these holograms can then be moved using finger gestures. This process involves a system that creates the 3D image, an optical system that puts this image into the air, and a touch sensor. According to the application, the hologram is created using infrared lasers - or similar devices - that project the image onto a surface above the display. This projection would then appear via the optical system, which could be situated between two parabolic or concave mirrors that have reflective surfaces facing each other. Money saving website Vouchercodespro.co.uk asked their patent and trademark insider to help them devise what the holographic iPhone may look like. The images, pictured above and below, show how the Apple menu and alarm could work using this holographic system.","The images were published by French site Nowhereelse.fr .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Images of a striking dancer from the racy Fantasy revue and her dismembered corpse were shown for the first time Thursday to a Las Vegas jury hearing opening statements in the murder trial of an ex-boyfriend accused of killing her in 2010. Jason Omar 'Blu' Griffith sat impassively with his attorneys as prosecutor Marc DiGiacomo told the jury that evidence during the next several days will prove that Griffith choked Deborah Flores Narvaez and asphyxiated her with a plastic bag over her head — and twice tried to dispose of her body in tubs of cement. Griffith defense attorney Jeff Banks told the jury the case isn't that simple. Gruesome murder: Jason Omar 'Blu' Griffith (left) is on trial in Las Vegas for allegedly murdering his girlfriend Deborah Flores Narvaez (right) and dismembering her body in 2010 . Blank stare: Griffith appeared impassive in court Thursday  as the prosecutor laid out the evidence for the jury . Griffith, now 35, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder. Banks said evidence will show he was defending himself when his ex-girlfriend died. 'They will show you pictures, and they will be gruesome and they will be shocking,' Banks said. 'But that does not change the fact ... that he was scared and he was afraid that she was violent, and Jason Griffith was defending himself on Dec. 12, 2010.' Jurors were questioned for three days this week about what they remembered about news reports of Debbie Flores' disappearance in December 2010 and Griffith's arrest in January 2011. The story began as a missing person case, with posters and fliers distributed to the media. It made headlines for weeks through the Christmas and New Year's holidays while Flores' sister, Celeste Flores Narvaez, pleaded publicly for information. On Thursday, the jury heard from Flores Narvaez’s roommate and fellow Fantasy dancer Sonya Sonnenberg, who testified that on the day of the murder, the woman had gone to Griffith’s house to watch Dexter - a TV show about a serial killer - and never returned. Her dismembered, badly decomposing body was discovered weeks later in tubs of cement. Banks said the jury will hear about violence, property crimes, stalking, threats, harassment — all 'by Debbie Flores against Mr. Griffith' — as well as acts of battery and weapons. Tragic end: The up-and-coming burlesque dancer was discovered weeks after her disappearance in December 2013 hacked into pieces placed in tubs of cement . Adult entertainer: Flores Narvaez was a backup dancer in the risque Fantasy revue at Luxor hotel . A key piece of evidence is a video recording that Griffith made while confronting Flores about his car tires being slashed. In it, Flores admits to hitting Griffith, entering his house, looking on his computer, pouring egg whites on his car and slashing three tires. DiGiacomo predicted that every witness in the case would describe a volatile relationship between Flores and Griffith, who was arrested after an October domestic argument with Flores. The prosecutor spent more than an hour weaving a tale of tangled and overlapping romances — and Griffith becoming depressed and suicidal between the October fight with Flores and his 31st birthday on December 10. Griffith, a dancer in the Cirque du Soleil show Love at The Mirage, was having trouble juggling relationships at the time with Flores and with another woman, a dancer in another Cirque show at another Las Vegas Strip resort, DiGiacomo said. Police finally cracked the disappearance-turned-homicide case when they gave Griffith's housemate, Louis Colombo, immunity from prosecution. Opening statement: Prosecutor Marc DiGiacomo told the jury that evidence will prove that Griffith choked Flores Narvaez and asphyxiated her with a plastic bag over her head . Defense strategy: Griffith's lawyer Jeff Banks said his client was afraid that the dancer was violent, and he defended himself . Colombo told police he left the house after seeing Griffith put his hands around Flores' neck as they argued. When he returned, he could see Flores was dead. A friend, Kalae Casorso, told police that Griffith admitted to her that Debbie Flores was in the huge tub of cement he and Colombo tried to store at her house. DiGiacomo's description was graphic. The tub, with Flores' body and 600lbs of cement, weighed more than 700lbs as Griffith and Colombo tried to wheel it on dollies to a vacant home, the prosecutor said. He said Colombo would describe standing watch outside as Griffith chiseled the big block apart and sawed the legs off Flores' corpse to fit her remains in two smaller concrete-filled tubs that weighed less. 'The problem for Mr. Griffith is, it's painfully apparent that he never does anything alone,' DiGiacomo told the jury as he stood before a video screen showing autopsy photos of the torso and severed legs. Griffith allegedly admitted to a friend that Debbie Flores was in a huge 600lbs tub of cement . Bitter irony: Flores Narvaez’s roommate and fellow Fantasy dancer Sonya Sonnenberg testified that on the day of the murder, the woman had gone to Griffith’s house to watch Dexter - a TV show about a serial killer . Celeste Flores Narvaez, sister of Deborah Flores . Narvaez, was outraged by the defense attorney's theory that the slain dancer was the aggressor , .","Jason Omar 'Blu' Griffith, 35, is on trial in the December 2010 murder of Fantasy revue show dancer Deborah Flores Narvaez .

"By . Jill Reilly . Three GCSE pupils from a top school have been taken to hospital after collapsing during break-time after smoking a 'legal high' narcotic. The two boys and one girl aged 15 and 16 were among six pupils who took a quantity of herbal mixture Pandora's Box after it was sneaked into the school by another girl who boasted on Facebook: 'Let's all get high.' The teenagers collapsed after taking the mixture which often marketed as 'herbal ecstasy'. They were taken to hospital by ambulance after they began vomiting and have all been kept in for observation. Three GCSE pupils from a top Roman Catholic school have been taken to hospital after smoking a 'legal high' narcotic during a secret drug taking session at break-time . Headmaster Stephen Tierney wrote a  stern letter to parents . A number of other pupils and the girl who supplied it were treated by paramedics at St Mary's Catholic College in Blackpool, Lancashire, but did not need to go to hospital. Today an investigation is underway at the 1,334 pupil voluntary aided school - one pupil has already been disciplined with others facing possible further action. Lancashire Police are also investigating Wednesday morning's incident. In a stern letter to parents headmaster Stephen Tierney said: 'Please would you take a moment to speak to your child about the importance of keeping themselves safe, including not taking medicines, pills or legal substances which have not been prescribed for them. 'Whilst the substance taken by the students was legal, the college considers the matter unacceptable and will now look at whether disciplinary action should arise out of this issue.' The drug . was brought into class after a girl bought the drug over the internet . and sent a message to her friends on Facebook inviting classmates to . join in saying they were all going to get high. But in between morning classes on Wednesday the pupils began collapsing and had to be helped by teachers.

Box which is also sold under the name Clockwork Orange or Salvia and . features a picture of an evil 'Devil skull' is a cannabis type drug . usually sold in herbal smoking mixtures. Inhaling the herbal drug produces a ‘legal high’ which experts say mimics the effects of psychedelic drugs such as LSD and lasts up to ten minutes. Side effects include agitation, paranoia, increased heart rate, aggression, various levels of consciousness and vomiting. Drug experts warn it can trigger psychotic episodes, particularly in young people and those with mental health problems. It was linked to the death of Ryan Santanna, a 21-year-old film student who fell from a balcony in New York after smoking it in 2011. Harry Shapiro of the charity DrugScope said that, at high doses, salvia has similar effects to LSD, triggering hallucinations and distorting time. 'There is the danger with hallucinogenic drugs that people can injure themselves because they are seeing something that isn’t there,’ he added. ‘There is the very odd case of people who believe they can fly. And, of course, people can just get scared by whatever it is that they see.’ In his letter Mr Tierney added: 'Three . Key Stage 4 students took a legal substance which caused them to become . very ill and as a precaution we sent them immediately to hospital. 'The . substance was brought onto the College site by one student. The . preliminary investigation has shown that it was sourced from a Facebook . page and mobile number. 'The purchase of it was organised from home, the night before, via social media. The use of social media in this incident left a clear information trail which we now have.' One student at the school said: 'We heard that one of the girls sent a message on Facebook saying she had got the drugs and that they should all get high the following day. 'They thought it was great but they soon became ill and they were found by teachers. We heard six pupils were taking the drug. It's unbelievable. St Mary's is a very good school and to hear about pupils taking drug here is unheard of.' Former pupils include the Nolan sisters, .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Hundreds . of suspected militants have been charged with carrying out a wave of . terrorist attacks in Egypt that killed 40 police officers and 15 . civilians. The . country’s chief prosecutor’s office confirmed 200 people had been . charged in connection with the attacks and with conspiring with al-Qaeda . and the Palestinian militant group Hamas. In . a statement released today, the office said the defendants - 98 of whom . remain on the run - are all suspected members of the al-Qaeda-inspired Ansar Beit . al-Maqdis group, also known as the Champions of Jerusalem. Egypt's chief prosecutor's office has charged 200 suspected militants with carrying out terrorist attacks that killed 40 policeman and 15 civilians, including an attack on a security headquarters in December, pictured . The . militant group has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks which . were carried out following the military overthrow of Islamist President . Mohammed Morsi last summer. The prosecutor's statement refers to the . group as 'the most dangerous terrorist group', and accuses the . defendants of receiving military training in the Palestinian Gaza Strip . under the patronage of Hamas, and of travelling to Syria where they took . part in fighting against government forces there before returning to . Egypt. Officials accuse Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood of orchestrating the violence - a charge the group denies. The . prosecutors, bringing one of the country's largest terrorism-related . cases, accuse the defendants of carrying out 51 attacks in recent months and . receiving training with Hamas in Gaza and in Syria. The attacks are said to include a bombing . of the capital's security headquarters in January which killed six . people, a failed assassination attempt against the interior minister in . September, and a December attack against the security headquarters in . the Nile Delta city of Mansoura which killed 16, almost all policemen. The attacks are said to include a bombing of the capital's security headquarters in January which killed six people and a failed assassination attempt against the interior minister in September, pictured . The 200 defendants have also been charged with conspiring with al-Qaeda and the Palestinian militant group Hamas in what is one of the country's largest terrorism-related cases . The attacks also include the assassination of a senior police officer, who was the main investigator and a key witness in one of the trials in which Morsi is the main defendant. The group, which had originally operated mostly in the restive north Sinai governorate, had claimed responsibility for the attacks. Since Morsi's ouster, authorities have cracked down heavily on Islamists, arresting thousands and putting hundreds on trial, including Morsi, on charges that include instigating violence and holding illegal protests. Morsi is also accused of conspiring with foreign groups to destabilise Egypt. The Brotherhood denies the charges and says authorities are seeking to associate them with violence to further undermine the group. The statement also said the prosecutor's investigation revealed that Morsi, while in office, had negotiated with the group to ensure it abstained from violence during his rule in exchange for a presidential pardon to their colleagues in prison. The prosecutors accuse the defendants of carrying out 51 attacks in recent months.

"By . Paul Donnelley . A British tourist accused of stealing a moped in Thailand was beaten to death in jail by a fellow inmate while in prison, an inquest has heard. Sean Flanagan died after a man allegedly jumped onto his body with both knees before pressing down on him so hard he suffered broken ribs and 'blunt-object trauma'. Yet it took Thai authorities eight months to begin an investigation into the death, following pressure from the victim's family. Initially, the authorities had claimed that Flanagan had fallen off a wall but another prisoner at Pattaya Remand Prison has now been charged with his manslaughter. Sean Flanagan was arrested after he went into a pawn shop and took a moped, according to a report in The Pattaya Daily News at the time . Flanagan, 46, divided his time between his home at Dalton, Cumbria, and Thailand, where his girlfriend lived. Ian Smith, the coroner for South and East Cumbria, concluded Flanagan’s death was due to ‘injuries following an assault or assaults’. A post mortem was carried out on April 24 after his body was repatriated, the inquest at Barrow Town Hall heard yesterday. The cause of death was recorded as blunt chest trauma, but bruising to the face, abdomen and limbs was also noted. Pattaya Remand Prison where Sean Flanagan was sent and died. Another prisoner has been charged with his manslaughter . DCI Bob Qazi, who has been liaising with the Flanagan family, said: ‘The doctor concluded she is in no doubt he was the victim of a serious assault with rib fractures and bruising to his body.’ Flanagan was arrested last March and accused of stealing the moped and taken to Pattaya Remand Prison two days later where he was said to have been behaving unusually. DCI Qazi said: ‘It was said by several people he was losing his self-control, refusing to sleep and exhibiting violent behaviour. The gist of it was he was disturbing other prisoners and irritating them.’ On March 29, he was visited by embassy officials who discovered that he was in a wheelchair, heavily bruised and speaking incoherently. Prison officials said that the injuries had been caused by Flanagan falling off a wall and into a drinking trough. It was later revealed that he had been attacked. A second, and fatal, assault occurred sometime after the embassy official’s visit. It was not until November 2013 that the Thais began an investigation. Ian Smith, the coroner for South and East Cumbria, concluded Flanagan's death was due to 'injuries following an assault or assaults' DCI Qazi said: ‘Mr Flanagan was assaulted by a man who admitted to jumping on his body with both knees, pressing his knees into Mr Flanagan’s chest for a period of time.’ The man, who has not been named, has since been charged with the Thai equivalent of manslaughter. Summing up, Coroner Smith praised Flanagan’s family, DCI Qazi and the office of Barrow and Furness MP John Woodcock for helping push for an investigation. In a statement, Flanagan’s family urged the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to do more to support families in similar situations. ‘It is vital that the Foreign Office improves its communications system and realises that it is dealing with people and not case numbers. ‘Sean, we will miss you terribly.’ Flanagan was arrested after he went into a pawn shop and took a moped, according to a report in The Pattaya Daily News at the time. He was charged after driving the moped to a nearby hotel, but denied the theft, the newspaper reported. Flanagan's friend Steven Strefford, 53, from Walney, Barrow, said: ‘One of my mates rang me straightaway when he got the news. He got done for nicking a moped and then banged up. ‘It’s a hell of a shame. I have known Sean a lot of years and he was one of those guys who, if you wanted a hand with anything, he would be there for you. We had some good laughs, we used to go out fishing together and he was an absolutely blinding lad. I couldn’t believe it when I heard. He was just a cracking guy.’ Although he returned to Barrow frequently to see friends and pick up work, Flanagan had travelled all over Asia, Africa and Europe, he said. Mr Strefford added: ‘I tried to keep in touch with him, but he was always jaunting all over the place. He would always be back here for two or three months and get a bit of work somewhere and then be off out there somewhere. ‘He would always come back to see his mates, he will be sadly missed.‘He did anything and everything; he could always turn his hand to anything. If there was job to do, he would do it.’","Sean Flanagan from Cumbria was sent to Pattaya Remand Prison .

Out of the blue the former FHM model began shouting at her friend off-camera and broke off from the live television interview. 'Stop it! I’m sorry. This isn’t live,' she shouted. As she continued to look at her friend she rambled incoherently. 'What? I already said that. Stop it. Go away.' Scroll down for video...

Every time she gets in front of a camera, Grant seems to make headlines . Whlie she was on camera, Ms. Grant spoke about how her current fifteen minutes of fame could help her career going forward. 'I’m hoping that this entire experience makes me verified by Twitter because I’ve been a sports fanatic for a long time,' she told FOX. 'I support a lot of teams. I have lots of professional players following me. They love my tweets.' Ms Grant currently has more than 84,000 Twitter followers and counting. She reminded her fans that they can expect to see her at the next Clippers game on Friday. 'I have almost the exact same seats,' she said. 'In fact; I think I should be an employee.

"By . Ryan Gorman . Jailed: Andrew Tahmooressi is currently cooling his heels in a Mexican jail . A Marine jailed in Mexico for bringing illegal firearms into the country insists his arrest is a mistake and that he should be allowed to go back to San Diego. Sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi, 25, and originally from Weston, Florida, insisted to Mexican officials he landed south of the border March 31 after a wrong turn and that his guns were legally purchased and licensed in the U.S. – they jailed him anyway. Mother Jill Tahmooressi told WBFS that her son insisted the whole thing is a misunderstanding, that he should be set free and allowed to leave the country, and she agrees. ‘I can understand why the Mexican officials needed to investigate,’ she told the station. ‘But 72 hours later they surely had the evidence that those guns were traced, legally purchased, traced to his name, no criminal record, a Marine whose been honorably discharged.’ Her criticism came hours after finding out he was being transferred to a new jail for his own safety and days after he gave a scathing interview to the San Diego Union-Tribune. ‘I said, ‘I have three guns’ and I showed them where the guns were and they checked out the guns and I said, ‘I didn’t even mean to be in Mexico. It was a mistake for me to be here. Can I just go back to the border?’ He told the paper. Combat veteran: Tahmoressi served two tours in Afghanistan before his honorable discharge . ‘Five minutes later I was surrounded by like 20 military officials and police officers with guns watching me.’ The honorably discharged Marine who served two tours in Afghanistan was soon arrested for weapons smuggling, and said he then had his life threatened. ‘The people in there they started messing with me,’ he recalled. ‘They were trying to make me more scared than I already was.’ His worried mother says the combat veteran moved west to get treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and that being shot at while trying to escape probably wasn’t ideal, bu that he’s remained calm under pressure. Nearly two dozen U.S. lawmakers sent a letter this week to the Mexican government urging a quick release of the former Marine, according to The Blaze. Their plea has gone unanswered. Dozens of people also protested Thursday in front of the Mexican consulate in Miami. Protests: Protesters gathered in front of the Mexican Consulate in Miami this week calling for his release . ‘I can tell that he’s just being as gracious and polite as a fine Marine would be,’ she told the station. He appears to be keeping in good spirits despite his next court hearing not being until May 28. ‘I had no intentions of smuggling my weapons,’ he said. ‘I had no intention of selling them or anything of that sort. I’m a pretty decent guy. I’m a pretty good man with good morals. I believe in God. I put my faith in God that he’ll take care of me.’ Jill Tahmooressi is for now holding out hope her son is released either before the hearing or shortly after it.","Andrew Tahmooressi has been in a Mexican jail since March 31 .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A 14-year-old New Hampshire girl was filmed telling her school board off after they had her father arrested for breaching a two minute rule for speaking. Marina Baer told the Gilford School Board ‘I don’t trust you’ only minutes after watching father William Baer being handcuffed and hauled off by a police officer at the board’s request. The arrest came after William Baer became upset while being told to be quiet during a discussion about the book ‘Nineteen Minutes,’ which includes graphic sexual content he felt was inappropriate for a classroom. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'I don't trust you': Marina Baer told the school board how she really feels after they had her father arrested . ‘I honestly don’t feel safe around you people,’ said the high school freshman in a video of her bold stand. ‘I just watched my father get arrested because he broke the two minute rule, at a board of education meeting. ‘This just shows that you resort to force at the first turn of conflict and I am appalled,’ the teen continued. ‘So I don’t trust you.’ Her comments came after a police officer hauled her father out of the room, slapped handcuffs on him in the hallway and led him out of the school, as shown in video from WMUR. The man was arrested for objecting to a book that includes a graphic sexual content describing rough sex between two teenagers, according to WCVB. The sexually-charged read culminates with: ‘semen, sticky and hot, pooled on the carpet beneath her,’ according to the website BizPac Review. 'This is ridiculous': William Baer (gesturing and wearing a suit while sitting down at left) objected to not receiving notification of the book's graphic content sooner . 'You're arresting me?'; The outraged father was only further aggravated by the police officer arriving to cart him away . ‘This is ridiculous,’ William Baer said in response to another parent arguing in favour of allowing high schoolers to read the novel. ‘Why don’t you have me arrested, why don’t we do that as a civics lesson?’ He continued. ‘Nice First Amendment lesson right? ‘Nobody’s talking about censoring the book, nobody’s talking about banning the book or burning the book,’ William Baer continued as he was asked by a moderator off camera to be respectful of other people in attendance. ‘Like you’re respectful of my daughter right?’ He fired back as an officer confronted him. Taken away: William Baer is led out of the school by a cop . Cuffed: He is then arrested and led outside before his daughter's outburst . ‘You’re going to arrest me because I violated the two minute rule?’ He asks the cop. ‘This is ridiculous,’ William Baer says when the cop says he will be arrested. ‘This is the civics lesson.’ The father is then led out of the board meeting with his young daughter running behind him into the hallway and watching him being handcuffed shortly before returning to chide the board members. His wife Barbara Baer stood by her man when interviewed by WCVB. ‘I fully understand how he feels. It really is a huge violation,’ she told the station. ‘Why should those ideas be put in their mind. They can discuss this some other way. They don’t need that kind of imagery.’ The school sent notifications home to parents, but only after students had already received the book. It is not exactly clear what crime William Baer was charged with, and MailOnline was not able to immediately reach local authorities.","Marina Baer told the school board that arresting her father left her 'appalled' and unable to trust the board members .

"By . Taylor Auerbach . Welcome to the 'ocean of gambling'. Right now, thousands of people around the world are gawking at video clips of other people winning big on poker machines - and potentially adding even more money to their coffers in the process. Hundreds of thousands of videos of pokies hitting jackpots, features and massive payouts have been uploaded to YouTube, with view counts in the millions. 'I think it's culturally devastating and utterly deceitful, most people lose,' World Vision Australia CEO and chair of the Australian Churches Gambling Taskforce reverend Tim Costello told MailOnline. Scroll down for video . Dangerous pastime: Psychologists have warned the YouTube videos could trigger gambling binges in addicts . 'It's a free world, people can upload what they want, but someone needs to tell them they are entrapping and ruining somebody who sees it and says ""that could be me""...your joy at winning can only be at the cost and sorrow of somebody who loses.' Many of the clips - which can be viewed by children of any age in most instances - feature extremely extravagant  high-rollers who boast about betting hundreds of dollars per spin. 'This is really what's got the public upset, parents are saying who asked them about their kids being handed over to gambling. It's everywhere. Kids have got smartphones at school where they can watch these videos,' reverend Costello said. One Australian YouTube user, who goes under the alias of 'Pokey Ranger', uploaded a video of him winning more than $10,000 on a $180 spin in an Australian casino. The video has been viewed 100,000 times and Pokey Ranger and his friend can be heard swearing at the machine and willing it to 'give them a hand'. Under the video Pokey Ranger brags about belonging to the 'ocean of gambling', ridicules other small-time gamblers for being 'tadpoles' and describes walking into the high-roller areas in Australian casinos as becoming 'enlightened'. In another video Pokey Ranger complains openly on his way to winning $6300 on a $62.50 spin. 'So far it's s***,' he says after winning $3000. High rollers: The pokie porn videos feature massive bets and massive wins . In the comments section he later wrote: 'I was not over the moon with it and I am in Australia and you can win much more then $10,000 on a poker machine in in the high roller areas where the max bet is actually $450 a hit.' One of the most popular machines to feature in the YouTube gambling community is 'Big Red' - an Australiana-themed pokie in which a kangaroo falling in the right place trigers five free spins. Manufacturers Aristocrat describe the machine as 'hugely successful'. More than 4,000 videos of the game have been uploaded to YouTube, the most popular of which has been viewed 180,000 times. 'Ocean of gambling': The YouTube clips are keenly discussed in online gambling forums . Uploaded by Aussie 'D Reid' the clip was filmed at Sydney's Royal George Hotel and shows Mr Reid collecting a tidy $6,000 on a $10 spin. Sydney clinical psychologist Bill Campos told MailOnline the videos have the potential to cause serious addiction problems, with access to online casinos only a click away. 'The problem is you're just seeing the sizzle, the five minute clip of somebody being elated,' he said. 'It perpetuates that feeling of ""where is the next roll of the dice? where is the next pull of the pokie?"" 'With YouTube there's no real way of stopping kids watching anything...a kid of 12 or 13 could see this and say ""someone's winning, great""...it could have implications down the track.' Mr Campos said online casinos were especially dangerous because they didn't provide the 'social queues' for gamblers to stop betting. Fed up: World Vision Australia CEO and chair of the Australian Churches Gambling Taskforce has described the trend as 'devastating' 'There is nobody there to say enough is enough, you're just in a room by yourself. 'In a casino or pub there are people packing up, drinks are finishing...there is none of that at home.' YouTube users with popular channels are able to 'monetise' their videos - meaning the website pays them a small percentage of the revenue earned from placing ads at the start of, and during, clips. It is unclear according to YouTube's online policies if the clips are eligible for monetisation and the website did not immediately respond to requests for clarification. The guidelines tell users: 'Videos showing software user interface may be monetized only if you have a contract with the publisher or you have paid a licensing fee.' MailOnline noted a number of the popular poker machine videos carried advertisements on them. Aussie YouTube user Colin, whose channel Col447 has been viewed more than 1 million times, would not comment on whether he receives an income from the hundreds of poker machine videos on his YouTube account. ‘Watching pokie wins on YouTube is cheap entertainment,’ he said. ‘Plus only the big wins are uploaded for the viewers. It's good to see someone win big for a change.’ A Facebook page called Pokie Wins – which has been liked nearly 18,000 times – is home to a number of the more popular YouTube clips. Online hit: The video of this huge win has been viewed more than 57,000 times .","Videos show people betting hundreds of dollars per spin .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Silvio Berlusconi completed his first day of community service at an old people’s home yesterday as part of his sentence for tax fraud. As the disgraced former Italian prime minister arrived at the Catholic-run facility in Cesano Boscone, near Milan, one protester wearing a clown hat shouted: ‘You should be in prison!’ Berlusconi, 77, has been ordered to work four-hour shifts once a week for a year after being found guilty in 2013 of tax fraud in the acquisition of TV rights to films. His tasks at the care home included entertaining Alzheimer’s patients and helping them with meals. Scroll down for video . Former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has been ordered to carry out community service at an old people's home following his tax fraud conviction . Berlusconi was spared prison as in Italy criminals over 70 rarely go to jail. The billionaire media mogul, who has dominated Italian politics for two decades, is leading his Forza Italia party’s campaign for the European elections despite being barred from standing as an MEP. Former Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi carried out his first four-hour community service stint Friday, observing work on an Alzheimer's ward as part of a tax fraud sentence. The three-time former premier made no comment as he came and went from the sprawling Sacra Famiglia center for the elderly and infirm, under the gaze of dozens of journalists kept behind barricades. But he later told regional Lombard TV that many of the patients he saw were 'in a very, very difficult situation, difficult to endure'. One woman, he said, kissed him, while a group of men who were able to walk about turned off the TV and came over to chat. 'Of course, these were the less serious cases,' Berlusconi said.While he was heckled on arrival by a lone union protester who said he should instead be at a nearby prison, a supporter waved down his car as he left the premises and he had the car stopped to thank her. Despite serving a community service sentence for tax fraud the former Italian PM is running for the European Parliament . Berlusconi, 77, was ordered to perform four hours of community service a week after his four-year sentence was reduced to one by a general amnesty. He also lost his Senate seat because of the conviction, but remains an important political force as head of his Forza Italia party. The court's order permits him flexibility to campaign for the upcoming European elections, but only in the northern Lombard region and around Rome, where he can travel from Tuesday to Thursday. Courts have warned that he could be put under house arrest if he insults the judicial system during his sentence, and the Sacra Famiglia administrators have barred any campaigning on the grounds. Berlusconi has promised surprises during his service — and told private radio on Thursday that he has been studying the latest treatments for Alzheimer's disease 'to give nurses a way to be able to do more'. Still, Sacra Famiglia's director has said his integration into the routine will be gradual. He spent the first day observing work in the two-story structure that houses the Alzheimer's patients, accompanied by the director of the residential unit. During his community service, Berlusconi is scheduled to arrive after breakfast during a period of recreation, where caregivers assist in activities that can include playing music for the patients. Lunch follows, but it is unlikely Berlusconi will help feed patients, at least at first. Then there is a period of rest, during which many patients return to their rooms. 'Silvio Berlusconi won't have an office. He won't perform activities that are fun and relaxing,' Sacra Familia director Paolo Pigni told reporters last week. He added that patients in such 'fragile' conditions can be 'a social treasure' for those who come in contact with them.","Sylvio Berlusconi appeared at an old people's home to start his community service sentence .

"By . Daniel Martin . Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to bring in tough new curbs on strikes in 'essential' services if the tories win the next election . The Tories will bring in tough new curbs on strikes in ‘essential’ services if they win the next election, David Cameron pledged yesterday. The Prime Minister said he intends to introduce a minimum threshold on the number of employees who must take part in a ballot on  industrial action before it can trigger a strike. He said he had been held back from introducing a threshold of this type since he took office in 2010 because of opposition from Liberal Democrats in the Coalition Government. Mr Cameron told BBC Radio London: ‘Of course there is a right to strike in our country. But in essential services, isn’t it worth saying that there ought to be a threshold, a certain percentage of people who have to take part before a strike is called that does so much damage?’ ‘This is not something I can deliver in Coalition. Our Liberal . Democrat coalition partners don’t seem keen on this, for whatever . reason. But I am keen on it, and a new Conservative Government would . deal with that.’ He did not outline which types of industrial action could come under the remit of the new rules. A Number 10 source said no decisions had yet been taken, and it was not known at what level the turnout threshold would be set. But campaigners have called for a minimum threshold to be introduced for the railways, the fire service, the NHS and schools. However Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB union, responded: ‘If 50 per cent of those eligible to vote becomes the new test of . democratic legitimacy, not a single MP including Mr Cameron passes the . test. ‘Few would argue that the outcome of a general election is a . lot more important than the result of any strike ballot. We cannot have . abstentions added to no votes to count as a no vote in a strike ballot . and totally ignored in the more important ballot vote to elect our . Parliament. ‘Workers’ rights are already severely constrained and . curtailing the right to strike even more is simply neither acceptable . nor democratic.’ David Cameron, pictured giving a talk in Gloucestershire, said he intends to introduce a minimum threshold on the number of employees who must take part in a ballot on  industrial action before it can trigger a strike . Speaking at a question and answer session in Stroud, Gloucestershire, on . Thursday, Mr Cameron said: ‘When strikes take place that are hugely . disruptive to other people’s lives, they should at least have the . support of a good share of the members of that trade union. ‘I’m looking at if we can change that for the future, because I think a strike should be the last weapon that people use. ‘People . should be talking, people should be negotiating. In some of these cases . people have opted for a strike far too quickly and we need to change . that.’ London mayor Boris . Johnson has demanded a threshold to be set so that a strike cannot be . held unless at least 50 per cent of all eligible union members vote in . favour. London mayor Boris Johnson has demanded a threshold to be set so that a strike cannot be held unless at least 50 per cent of all eligible union members vote in favour . Tory MP Dominic Raab, who has campaigned for strike thresholds, said: ‘We need this reform to make sure militant hardliners lacking majority support from rank and file members can’t hold the hard-working public to ransom with outlandish demands. ‘The public back this proposal by three to one, but yet again the Lib Dems have blocked a common-sense measure most would welcome.’ The comments come after a disruptive strike on the London Underground at the end of last month.","PM intends to introduce minimum threshold before strike can be triggered .

"By . Meghan Keneally . and Ashley Collman . Just hours after his ex-girlfriend declared her innocence in the murder of her roommate Meredith Kercher, Amanda Knox's former flame Raffaele Sollecito said that the Italian court's decision to reconvict them 'is completely unbelievable'. Sollecito told the Today Show this morning that latest court decision that names the American and her Italian boyfriend as the killers of her British study abroad roommate 'is full of errors, there are mistakes all over the pages' and he is planning on appealing. 'They invented new evidence... they pictured it happening (and) it never happened. They invented more fiction,' he said in a remote interview from Treviso, Italy. Scroll down for videos . Defending his name: Raffaele Sollecito has denied the charges placed against him in the latest round of the court case surrounding his ex-girlfriend's roommates' 2007 murder . 'I didn't know Meredith Kercher. I had no reason to hide an argument with Amanda or mere or anyone in this case. He said that 'no clue or little piece of suspect- nothing at all' places him at the scene or could tie him to the victim's murder. 'My position is completely different than Amanda's case,' he said, though it came just hours after Knox made a similar statement, saying there is no hard evidence to show her as the killer. 'If I were (at the scene), I would have had traces of Meredith's broken body on me and I would have left traces of myself around Meredith's corpse and I'm not there and that proves my innocence,' she told CNN in an interview that aired Thursday night. Close: The 26-year-old from Seattle, Washington got emotional as she spoke about Kercher, saying she wouldn't have killer her friend . 'It's only speculation that convicts us its evidence that acquits us.' Victim: Knox was first convicted of killing British roommate Meredith Kercher in 2007. She was allowed to return to the United States four years later when that decision was overturned. But the case was brought up again this year . Unlike Amanda, however, Raffaele was in Italy and in court for the latest incarnation of the trial while Amanda stayed in Washington state for fear that she would be re-imprisoned if the court found them guilty- which they did. 'I came back to Italy because here I have my dreams my life my friends and I have nothing to hide,' he said Friday morning. 'There's nothing against me and nothing has ever been against me. I have really a clear conscious and there is no reason for me to accept or understand why I am free or to look at my back or my shadows for the rest of my life. 'It is completely unbelievable and it's out of reality. It is a fiction.' Sollecito has vowed to appeal the latest decision, which finds them guilty of killing Kercher in 2007. This round- the third of its kind after they were first found guilty, then innocent, and now guilty again- raised new questions and suggested a new possible motive in the case. The formal ruling was handed down on Tuesday in a 337-page report, which finds that Knox stabbed Kercher to death in a fight over money. According to the report, known as a 'motivation' of the sentence, Knox inflicted the fatal knife wound to Kercher, a student at Leeds University. The document states: 'It is a matter of fact that at a certain point in the evening events accelerated; the English girl was attacked by Amanda Marie Knox, by Raffaele Sollecito, who was backing up his girlfriend, and by Rudy Hermann Guede, and constrained within her own room.' Finding the faults: Speaking from Treviso, Italy, Sollecito said his lawyers are working through the 337-page decision which was handed down on Tuesday . Couple: Knox and Socellito served four years in prison before being acquitted and released. However, they were reconvicted by the Florence appeals court on January 30, and sentenced to 28 and 25 years respectively . It adds that it's difficult to establish a reason for the brutal slaying of Ms Kercher, but goes on to cite allegations of tension between Knox and the student. It also refers to a statement that Guede made to police that Ms Kercher believed Knox stole 300 euros (£246) - and two credits cards - from her, which is described as a ‘valid motive’ for the murder. Knox is dumbfounded by the court's conclusions, saying she saved up money to go to Italy and wasn't financially strained. That's compared to Rudy Guede, who was separately convicted of Kercher's murder and testified in this latest case. Knox says he was 'a known thief, a known burglar who did this on a regular basis to survive'.","Raffaele Sollecito has spoken from Treviso, Italy about the latest ruling that charges both him and his ex Amanda Knox with murder .

"By . Glen Owen And Brendan Carlin . David Cameron could be forced to postpone this year’s Queen’s Speech because the Government is short of ‘sexy’ policies that can be agreed with the Lib Dems, a Minister claimed last night. The speech, which sets out the Government’s legislative programme as part of the State Opening, has taken place in early May since the Coalition introduced fixed-term Parliaments in 2010. But when Commons officials returned from their Christmas break, they were told the expected date of Wednesday May 7 might have to be ‘moved back’ to June, or even later, for ‘political reasons’. The Queen's speech sets out the Government's legislative programme as part of the State Opening of parliament . One senior Tory Minister said the potential delay had arisen because the Prime Minister had ‘ripped up’ the proposed programme of legislation for not being ‘sexy’ enough. The Minister told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Frankly, Downing Street wasn’t happy with what was on offer.’ Another Tory source said: ‘It is not so much that we have run out of policies, but we have pretty much run out of policies that haven’t been ruined by Clegg’s lot. We might need more time.’ State Openings used to be held in November or December, or, in a General Election year, when the new Parliament first assembled. But since 2012 it had been expected that the ceremony would take place on the first Wednesday or Thursday after the May Day recess. The 2012 ceremony took place on May 9, while the 2013 date was May 8. The speech may be delayed because the coalition partners cannot agree on 'sexy' policies to announce . An additional complication this year is that the local and European elections being held on May 22 could see the Tories pushed into third place behind UKIP – giving the Prime Minister an incentive to use the Queen’s Speech as a ‘relaunch’. The Minister added that the Tories’ continuing internal feud over Europe was another reason why the State Opening might have to be delayed. Last night a Downing Street spokesman said no decision had been made to delay the Speech. He added: ‘The date is not set in stone. The timing is entirely in our gift.’ A Tory source said: ‘If we hold it before the elections we are accused of breaching purdah, if we hold if afterwards we are accused of delaying it. ‘But it is true that Coalition government is making it harder to produce the legislative programme we want.’","Speech traditionally sets out Government's legislative programme .

"By . Sam Dunn . Millions of bank customers mis-sold useless credit card theft insurance are set for payouts from a £1billion compensation fund. Customers of HSBC, Barclays, Santander, NatWest and Nationwide will be paid compensations over the next few months. It follows an investigation last year by the Financial Conduct Authority into CPP, a company which sold so-called card and identity theft cover via banks between 2005 and 2011. Customers of HSBC, Barclays, Santander, NatWest and Nationwide will be paid compensations over the next few months . The City watchdog found many debit and credit card customers were duped into buying these policies which offered unnecessary cover if you lost your credit card or were victim to identity fraud. These policies, which together cost £120 a year, promised cover of up to £100,000 if crooks went on a wild spending spree with a stolen card. But banks already cover customers for this for free. And customers who thought they would be covered for up to £60,000 in losses suffered through identity theft later found out this was for legal or administration expenses – not the fraudulent debts run up. But the cost of meeting such debts is usually met by the bank itself, triggering doubts about why customers even had to pay for such a policy. After months of talks, the banks, CPP and City regulator are now close to a final compensation deal. The banks will shortly begin sending out letters to affected customers with details of how to claim. The compensation will leave the banks with an estimated £1billion bill but there are fears that it could be higher. Justin Modray said that it is thoroughly depressing to see another case of dreadful bank behaviour ripping off innocent customers . This will add more financial strain to banks on top of the £10billion recompense already racked up for mis-selling payment protection insurance. Justin Modray, founder of consumer finance website CandidMoney.com, said: ‘Although the payouts will be a welcome and long overdue boost to those households duped out of the money, it’s thoroughly depressing to see another case of dreadful bank behaviour ripping off innocent customers. ‘By asking loyal customers to pay more than £100 a year for policies that were essentially worthless,  it’s no wonder levels of trust in the high street banks is at absolute rock bottom.’ Some 4.4million card protection and identity fraud protection policies were sold between January 2005 and March 2011. Not all banks sold these policies. While many high-street operators did, Lloyds and Halifax chose not to. Roughly nine in ten were sold via banks and the rest bought directly from CPP. Many policies were also sold as part of a paid-for packaged bank account. The CPP card protection policy cost £35 a year, and identity protection £84 a year – a total  of £119. However, the report by the Financial Conduct Authority found CPP sold or renewed as many as 23million policies over a six-year period. It follows an investigation last year by the Financial Conduct Authority into CPP, a company which sold so-called card and identity theft cover via banks between 2005 and 2011 . The insurance was routinely sold whenever a customer sent a new bank credit or debit card had to call a CPP telephone number to activate the account. Staff then used high-pressure sales techniques to convince customers to take the policies out. On card protection, staff told customers the policy would cover them for between £50,000 and £100,000 of unauthorised transactions after you tell them your card has been taken. But this was unnecessary, as banks automatically cover you for this. And with identity theft protection, CPP staff would regularly overstate its importance or the threat of being defrauded. The City regulator report found some staff would wrongly tell customers that they would be liable for some of the debts if defrauded. Last year, CPP was fined £10.5million by the FCA and ordered to stop selling policies to new customers. A CPP spokesman said: ‘Our priority is to achieve the best outcome for those customers affected, and we’re helping many in difficult situations every day.’","Millions of customers will be paid compensation from a £1billion fund .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . The first American diagnosed with a mysterious virus from the Middle East was released Friday from a northwestern Indiana hospital after health officials determined the patient 'poses no threat to the community.' The patient is considered fully recovered and has been cleared by health officials to travel, if necessary, after testing negative for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, the Indiana State Department of Health said in a statement. Community Hospital chief medical information officer Dr. Alan Kumar said hospital officials completed their discharge plans for the patient with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Indiana health officials.

The patient has tested negative for MERS, is no longer symptomatic and poses no threat to the community,' Kumar said in the statement. MERS belongs to the coronavirus family that also includes the common cold and SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The virus appears to be unusually lethal — by some estimates, it has killed nearly a third of the people it sickened. That's a far higher percentage than seasonal flu or other routine infections. But it is not as contagious as flu, measles or other diseases. There is no vaccine or cure, and there's no specific treatment except to relieve symptoms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention flew from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to the United States on April 24, with a stop in London . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the patient is an American man. He flew from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to the United States on April 24, with a stop in London. He landed at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and took a bus to Indiana, health officials said. He went to the Munster hospital's emergency room April 28 with a fever, cough and shortness of breath. Health officials said in Friday's statement that multiple tests done at different times by the Indiana State Laboratory and the CDC 'were negative for the presence of ongoing MERS infection in the patient.' That statement said no additional cases of MERS have been identified. CDC: CDC spokesman Dr. Alan Kumar says there have been no additional cases of MERS in the U.S. Though the virus is not highly contagious, the hospital has isolated at home 50 employees identified as having come in contact with the man before he was diagnosed. Friday's statement said those staffers remain off duty and in temporary home isolation 'and are being closely monitored for symptoms.' Those workers will not be allowed to return to work at the hospital until after the MERS 'incubation period and confirmed negative laboratory results,' the statement said.","MERS stands for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . Mickey Rooney's widow has officially contested the legendary actor's will, which was signed just weeks before his death last month at 93 and completely cut her from his modest estate. The Hollywood showbiz veteran died on April 6 with $18,000 to his name, leaving it all to his stepson and nothing to his wife of 37 years, Jan Chamberlain - from whom he was estranged - or his other eight children. In a challenge that will be argued in Los Angeles County Probate Court on Monday, Chamberlain will claim the will contains a 'blatant misstatement' about agreements between her, the actor and his conservator, according to CNN. A court filing says Jan Chamberlain signed an agreement waiving all claims to her husband's estate after the couple separated in June 2012. Scroll down for video . Fight time: A lawyer for Jan Chamberlain says she's filing objections over Mickey Rooney's will, with a hearing to start the process of probating the will set for Monday in los Angeles. The will left Rooney's estate to a stepson and nothing to his wife or other eight children . Mickey Rooney updated his will weeks before his death and left his entire estate - which amounts to $18,000 - to his stepson Mark Rooney (front left) and Mark's wife Charlene (front right), who Rooney lived with in L.A. Rooney's estranged wife Jan Chamberlain (back right) is now contesting . Family ties: Jan Chamberlain, the mother of Chris and Mark Aber, was Mickey Rooney's eighth and final wife. The pair wed in 1978 - but spent the past two years apart. She is now contesting his will after being completely cut . Allegations: Mickey Rooney's stepson Chris Aber claims the star, who died age 93 on Sunday, ended his days held as a 'hostage' from his wife Jan - and choked to death on his food. He lays the blame at his younger brother Mark . But her lawyer's say this is a 'blatant misstatement'. 'There is NO provision in either of the two settlement agreements ... that terminates or in any way effects (her) rights as surviving spouse,' Chamberlain's attorney, Eugemne Belous, said. But Rooney's court-appointed conservator, Michael Augustine, who is also the executor in the will and part of his legal team, said Chamerlain's challenge is 'totally without merit'. 'She cannot resist her additional five minutes of fame,' Augustine said. Rooney's ammended will - which was signed March 11, just over three weeks before he died - named his stepson, Mark Rooney, who lived with in the two years leading up to his death, as the sole benneficiary. Rooney 'intentionally omitted' and disinherited his eight surviving biological children and two other stepchildren from his last marriage, the will said. Rooney had no negative feelings toward his surviving children, but they were all financially better off than he was, Augustine said, adding that Rooney believed that what little he had to leave should go to Mark Rooney and his wife, because they had been taking good care of him in his final years. However another of Rooney's stepsons, Christopher Aber, said the entertainer was a 'hostage' and was forcibly kept apart . from his eighth and current wife Jan Chamberlain - and alleges the star was so badly . treated that he died after choking on his food. Sole beneficiary: Mark Rooney has been looking after his stepfather for the last two years and has inherited the $18,000 estate of Mickey Rooney . Aber squared the blame at his younger brother, Mark Rooney, at whose Studio City home Mickey passed away. According to Augustine, the actor had been in good spirits and . was looking forward to continuing to appear in movies after filming a . scene for the upcoming installment of the Night at the Museum franchise. Augustine said Rooney, 93, passed a . physical exam required before he could start filming and his death was due to . natural causes, including complications related to diabetes. Police and coroner's officials were informed of Rooney's death but said no investigation was necessary. Despite a show business career spanning 90 years, Rooney said he had lost most of his fortune because of 'elder abuse' and financial mismanagement by another one of his stepsons. Augustine said despite an agreement for millions to be repaid to the actor, it was unlikely the estate could ever collect on the judgment. Christopher Aber was accused of taking $2.8 million from his stepfather, however he vehemently denied the allegations when speaking to The Mail Online.

Rooney Trust, it states the trust cannot be altered without one of the . trustees - Mickey Rooney and his estranged wife Jan Chamberlain Rooney - . signing off . 'The sad part is . that my mother has not been with my father for the last year, they’re . not divorced, they’re legally married, living separately,' Aber said. ‘Mickey . has been living apart with my brother.

No-one was there to pat him on the back? I found out when I spoke to the doctors.’ Rooney's will disinherited the actor's eight surviving children, as well as his estranged wife.

"By . Associated Press . Two officers at the U.S. Embassy in Yemen shot and killed a pair of armed Yemeni civilians during an attempted abduction of the Americans at a Sanaa business last month, the State Department said Friday. The officers have left Yemen, Marie Harf, a spokeswoman for the State Department, said in a statement. No other details were provided. Citing unidentified U.S. officials, The New York Times reported that the Americans were a CIA officer and a lieutenant colonel with the elite Joint Special Operations Command who were visiting a barber shop in an upscale district in Yemen's capital.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . The peace of an idyllic Utah canyon will be broken today as hundreds of ATV riders gather to use a trail they have been barred from since 2007. In a row that echoes that of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, the riders are challenging a Bureau of Land Management warning for them to stay away. The protesters have been told they could face prosecution if they take to the trail, which is home to 2,000-year-old Native American burial sites and cliff dwellings. Ban: A Bureau of Land Management agent puts a No Vehicles sign up at Utah's Recapture Canyon. ATV riders have been banned since 2007 . Fight back: The canyon protest is the latest clash with Western state residents and the BLM after the stand off with rancher Cliven Bundy, above . Utah governor Gary Herbert said he understood the frustration of ATV riders who are banned from a trail that is open to hikers and those on horseback, but he urged protesters not to break the law or disrupt public safety. The protest is the latest illustration of tension between Western residents and the federal government over management of public lands. But the off-road protest isn't expected to end in a confrontation like other recent ones. The BLM doesn't plan to block access or confront the riders, San Juan County Sheriff Rick Eldredge, who has been briefed on the agency's plans, said. The agency will, however, document those who ride ATVs on the prohibited trail, he said. Fight back: San Juan county commissioner Phil Lyman says the BLM is acting like a 'supreme authority' Protest: County commissioner Phil Lyman has urged ATV riders to rally, as Utah governor Gary Herbert called on protesters to be peaceful and not break any laws . San Juan . County Commissioner Phil Lyman said he expected hundreds at a city park . for a morning rally but only a handful to ride on the restricted trail. He has drummed up interest on social media but isn't recruiting militant types. Lyman, . whose family has been in the region for four generations, said the ride . is a demonstration of his disgust with the federal government's . overreaching control of public lands. 'They are not the supreme authority,' Lyman said. Recapture . Canyon is home to dwellings, artifacts and burials left behind by . Ancestral Puebloans. A gurgling stream in the canyon likely drew them as . it does outdoor enthusiasts today. Environmentalists . and Native Americans say the ban is needed to preserve fragile . artifacts. Navajos claim the people who lived there and are buried there . as ancestors. 'Those . ancient sites are the equivalent to churches,' Mark Maryboy, a former . Navajo Nation Council delegate, said. It's very disappointing that they . have no respect for Native American culture.' Idyllic: The Recapture Canyon was closed off to vehicles in 2007 to preserve its natural beauty . Landmark: The canyon is home to ancient ruins and burial grounds which are culturally important to Native Americans . The . canyon outside the city of Blanding is about 40 miles northwest of the . junction of Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado, known as the Four . Corners. The protest comes amid high tension over BLM practices. Last . month, the BLM had a standoff with militants in Nevada over a dispute . about the roundup of rancher Bundy's cattle. The BLM ultimately stepped . down. Utah ranchers and county leaders recently threatened to break federal law and round up wild horses this summer if the BLM doesn't do it first. Earlier this week, a BLM employee in Utah was threatened while driving on the highway by two armed men who were holding a sign that read: 'You need to die.' The federal government owns two-thirds of Utah's land. The Republican-dominated Legislature passed a law in 2012 that demands the state be given control of those lands before 2015, excluding national parks. Outlawed: The Bureau of Land Management doesn't want ATVs on the culturally important land . Motorized access to Recapture Canyon and other wilderness areas has long been a source of tension. ATV riders rode another off-limits trail in 2009 in a protest. No charges were filed. Lyman believes it is possible to reopen the canyon to ATVs while preserving the artifacts. But Jessica Goad of the Center for Western Priorities disagrees, pointing out that ATV riders blew their chance when authorities discovered two men used picks and shovels to create an off-road recreational vehicle trail in the canyon before the 2007 ban was in place. The BLM says that more than 2,800 miles of trails are open to ATVs on public lands within a short drive of Blanding. Pat Shea, a former national BLM director and attorney in Salt Lake City, said acts of civil disobedience put federal agencies in a difficult position. To prevent injuries and bloodshed, they must avoid clashes and work to de-escalate situations, but coming off weak brings its own consequence. 'It's a real policy dilemma because people begin to believe they can be the law into themselves,' Shea said. 'Then why should people stop at red lights?'","Hundreds gather to protest ban at Utah's Recapture Canyon .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Hillary Clinton was lauded for her record-breaking travels while Secretary of State and her husband make international trips regularly on behalf of his charitable foundation, but the couple is keeping quiet about their latest jaunt. The former President and First Lady were spotted near Oxford University on Friday and they are believed to be in town to celebrate their daughter Chelsea finishing her doctorate degree. The storied school would only say that they are visiting in a 'private capacity' according to ABC News early Friday afternoon but it was later confirmed that they are there to celebrate their daughter's academic accomplishment. Chelsea, 34, is scheduled to receive her doctorate three years after beginning the international relations program. Casual Friday: Hillary and Bill Clinton were spotted at Oxford University this afternoon . Fun weekend: The couple are in town because their daughter Chelsea will be graduating from her doctorate program on Saturday after three years of work . Old stomping grounds: Mr Clinton spent a year studying at the school as part of a Rhodes Scholarship program after he received his undergraduate degree at Georgetown . Like her father, she first went to Oxford to get her master's degree immediately after her undergraduate studies at Stanford. She returned to the U.S. after finishing her master's in 2003, but then started a second degree at the school in 2011. She . has been working on the dissertation focusing on international global . governance structures with a focus on global health since then but doing . the majority of the work in New York City. The . expectant mother, who announced that she is pregnant with her first . child last month, has not yet been spotted in England but the graduation . ceremony is set to take place on Saturday. Bill Clinton got his undergraduate degree at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. but won a Rhodes Scholarship when he graduated and headed back to school. He studied philosophy, politics and economics at University College at Oxford. He never ended up earning a degree from the school because he left early and returned to the United States to study law at Yale, where he would meet his soon-to-be wife. Though the couple apparently hoped to stay under the radar on today's trip, they have been pictured taking a leisurely stroll in the picturesque town. Taking in the country: The former President stopped to snap a picture of a bull with his camera phone . Nothing unusual: The powerful political couple seemed like normal tourists with the hoards of security guards being the only tip off of their position . At one point, the former President stopped to take a picture of a bull who was behind a fence on the side of the road using the camera on his phone. It doesn't look like that was intended to be shared, however. Both Clintons are active Twitter users but have kept their posts to a minimum and gave no hints about the intention of the trip on their social media accounts. Bill Clinton must be feeling slightly nostalgic of late because he gave a speech at Georgetown nearly two weeks ago and turned to Twitter to thank the students for coming out to listen to his speech in spite of bad weather.","Former President and Secretary of State are in town to celebrate their daughter's latest academic accomplishment .

"By . Ryan Parry In Toronto . Troubled Toronto mayor Rob Ford is being treated in a residential treatment program for substance abuse at a clinic in the US, his brother revealed Friday. Councillor Doug Ford spoke at the end week of a chaotic week for the Ford camp and amid wild speculation about Mayor Ford’s whereabouts. He told Canada’s CBC News that Ford checked in to the clinic on Thursday last week, a fact verified by a supervising doctor at the facility. Treatment: Doug Ford told reporters that his brother, Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, checked into rehab on Thursday . The health care provider, speaking on consent from the mayor, told CBC News that Ford enrolled in an in-patient program and remains under their care. Ford left the clinic last Saturday after a medical exam and was taken to hospital where he was admitted for four days before returning on May 7, to the same treatment facility. The doctor revealed that while in hospital Ford received ‘concurrent care’ with the treatment facility. ‘I have every assurance and confidence he was nowhere else,’ the doctor said. The confirmation that Mayor Ford is under going rehab comes amid a week of frenzied rumour and speculation, including several so called sightings of the mayor in the Toronto area. ‘Mayor Rob Ford has been under medical care 24-7 from the time he arrived in Canada, from Chicago, and he has been getting treatment,’ Councillor Doug Ford told CBC News Friday evening. Addict: Ford has spent the last several months fighting to keep his job after a collection of embarrassing, drug and alcohol-related incidents . The location of the treatment facility is being kept secret out of consideration for the privacy and confidentiality of Ford and other patients and staff. Doug says he hopes the move will quell speculation and stop some media organizations trying to spot Ford at the facility. ‘That would be a tragedy for 20 to 25 families that are there, trying to get help, trying to get treatment,"" said Ford.‘They don't want to disclose their locations or their identities. I think it would be a tragedy if the media swarmed in on a treatment centre and started taking pictures and started disclosing locations of other patients.’ Doug had promised to provide 'proof' that his brother was indeed going through treatment for alcoholism. He kept media organisations, many camped out outside his City Hall office, waiting all day. The information did not emerge until around 9pm Friday. Out of control: In his latest embarrassment, Ford was videotaped stumbling around a bar and ranting about beating someone up . Doug made the statement as a new video emerged of his troubled brother where the mayor is seen stumbling around drunk in a bar and ranting: 'No one better f*** with me....I'm going to kick you in the f****** head.' Meanwhile, his colleagues on city council have said they're doubtful he's in rehab. Coun. Joe Mihevc has been one of the most vocal in calling for proof the mayor is getting treatment. ‘For that political redemption story to be born, he has to provide proof that it’s warranted,’ Mihevc said.‘I don’t know what that proof is. The onus is on him to provide that proof for Torontonians to believe him.’ Mayor Ford has not been seen for a week since taking a leave of absence to deal with his alcohol and crack-smoking addictions. In name only: Most of Ford's mayoral powers were stripped from him by the city council after he was caught on video smoking crack . The new video, which was posted on the Toronto Sun's website, was reportedly shot in a Toronto bar on April 27 - in the same three-day period where videos also emerged of Ford making lewd, drunken remarks about a female politician in a bar and another of him smoking a purported crack pipe in his sister's basement. Citizens of Canada's largest city have been dubious their mayor is where he says he is, with sightings of Ford around town reaching fevered levels as members of the public upload pictures to Twitter of lookalikes. Doug had earlier said that allegations the mayor has been out of the supervision of healthcare professionals or has been seen in cars or coffee shops were completely false, maintaining he has not once been in public since he went into rehab last week. 'Since the day he went in, he has never been out in public,' he said. I only smoke when I drink: Ford has said his problem is with alcohol, as it sometimes prompts him to make bad decisions - like smoking crack . Ever since he went in to seek help last week, Doug said the mayor has been taking it seriously. 'He has at all times been under the supervision of medical professionals and never once been alone one day in treatment,' he said. Doug also denied claims that the mayor was away from rehab for three days this week — possibly in Muskoka, a small town north of Toronto. In an interview earlier this week, Ford said: ‘there are two doctors here, a captain of industry and a professional athlete.’","Doug Ford says his brother is in a alcohol treatment facility in the U.S.

"By . Chris Pleasance . With its legions of ice zombies, fearsome dragons and powerful warlocks, it can sometimes seem as if Game of Thrones is a little farfetched. However, dig below the surface and you will find it is largely based on historical events, as author George RR Martin has admitted himself. For example, the Wall which separates the kingdom of the North from the wild lands beyond is based on Hadrian's Wall; the Andles, who first separated Westeros into seven kingdoms, are a reference to the Anglo Saxons, who separated England into seven kingdoms. The war between the Starks and the Lannisters also bears stark similarities to the Wars of the Roses between the English houses of Lancaster and York between 1455 and 1487. Like the Starks, the House of York were northerners, like the Lannisters the House of Lancaster were southerners and extremely wealthy. But the parallels don't end there, some of the Lords and Ladies of Westeros bear a striking resemblance to historical figures as well. WARING: SPOILERS . Robert's own descent into debauchery may have been inspired by that of Edward IV (right) In his younger days, Robert Baratheon was a fearsome warrior, tough enough to lead a rebellion, overthrow thousands of years of Targeryen rule and establish a new rule with himself as King. Not unlike a young Edward IV who brought the Yorkist line to the throne in 1461, but later descended into drunkenness and lewd behaviour, much like Robert, his fictional counterpart. Edward, like Robert, also changed his will on his deathbed, naming a regent as his successor and causing a succession crisis. Edward died after an accident while fishing, while Robert died after being skewered by a boar. The lusty Robert, a fan of both wine and hunting, also bear more than a few similarities with Henry VIII, who was also a fierce warrior who later developed a penchant for a feast or two. Petyr Baelish is a low-born man who worked his way into the court of Robert Baratheon keeping one hand firmly on the purse strings, as did Thomas Cromwell with the court of King Henry VIII . If Robert bears similarities with Henry VIII, then it fits that Petyr Baelish, his master of coin in Game of Thrones, should make an historical parallel with Thomas Cromwell, who played a central role in Henry's court. Like Cromwell, Baelish is not a high-born man. He worked his way into the King's service using guile, skill, and by keeping a firm grip on the kingdom's purse strings. Cromwell started life as the son of a brewer, and was a soldier for a time, but later trained as a lawyer and gained skills in accountancy before working himself into the King's court. However he was a scheming man who betrayed one of his staunchest allies in Anne Boleyn which ultimately saw her executed. Baelish himself is also a ruthless schemer, had a hand in betraying King Joffrey to his death, and may have helped the Starks on the way to an early grave as well. Write caption here . In a world of traitors and deviants, Eddard Stark stands for all that is good, just and fair. He was a fearsome warrior, a masterful ruler, and an honorable man, though it eventually betrayed him to his death. Much like Richard, Duke of York. He fought in the Hundred Year's War in France, and for his success was rewarded with various offices of state, proving an efficient and capable ruler through all of them. Like Eddard after Robert's death, Richard also became protector of the Kingdom during Henry VI's madness. However, he had bitter disagreements with Henry's wife, Mary of Anjou, as Ned did with Cersi Lannister. Richard eventually tried to seize the throne but was unsuccessful, mirroring the moment Ned attempts to seize the throne from Joffrey. Ultimately both Richard and Ned were killed by beheading, and ended up with their heads mounted on spikes. Both Cersi and Mary of Anjou were known as schemers who put their own desires before the common good . Henry VI's wife, Margaret of Anjou, was known for being a controlling an scheming woman who often put her own desires above the greater good. She also had disagreements with Richard, Duke of York, and ultimately saw his head put on a spike. Much like Cersei, who spent most of her time before Robert died disagreeing with Ned Stark - before his head was put on a spike - and most of her time after his death plotting and scheming to get her illegitimate son Joffrey on the Iron Throne and secure her place there. At the Purple Wedding, she shows she is not averse to putting her own desires ahead of the common good, ordering the spare food from the feat to be thrown to the dogs, rather than being given to the city's poor, as rival Margery Tyrell ordered. Daenerys and Henry Tudor both raised armies overseas. Later Henry used his to seize the English throne. we can only hop that at some point Daenerys gets around to doing the same . Henry Tudor, later Henry VII, took the throne from Richard III after crossing the channel with a foreign army in tow, marching through his birthplace and recruiting more troops along the way. For many years before that, however, he lived a life of exile in France while chaos slowly spread in England, waiting for the perfect moment to seize his opportunity. Not a little unlike Daenerys, who has been slowly amassing a huge army across the Narrow Sea (read: the English Channel) while plotting to invade her birthplace, rallying the loyal to her cause as she goes. Loyal to his King, but unfaithful to his nephew heirs, Richard III mirrors Stannis Baratheon. But while Richard eventually seized the throne, Stannis has so far fallen short . Stannis, brother of Robert Baratheon, was unfaltering in his loyalty to the King while he was alive, but after Robert's death, declared his own nephews illegitimate and tried to seize the throne for himself using some fairly controversial tactics. Richard III, brother of King Edward IV, was also loyal up until the point of the King's death, upon which he declared his own nephews illegitimate, and succeeded to the throne after their 'disappearance'. Both Robb Stark and Edward IV betrayed a promise of marriage, leading formerly close allies to rebel . While Edward's descent into drinking a lasciviousness may have inspired Robert Baratheon's drinking and infidelity, Edward's marriage was undoubtedly what inspired Robb's own tumultuous love-life. Edward rushed into an impulsive marriage which alienated one of his key allies, the Earl of Warwick, who had arranged for the king to marry the sister-in-law of the French monarch, Louis XI. The Earl, Richard Neville, later rebelled against Edward as Walder Frey rebelled against Robb, leading to his gruesome death at the Red Wedding. Frey, as we know, betrayed Robb because the Young Wolf went back on his vow to marry one of Frey's daughters. Both Theon and George were separated from their parents at a young age following an unsuccessful rebellion. George also betrayed his brother to appease his father-in-law, while Theon betrayed Robb - who he thought of as a brother - to appease his father Baylon . Theon Greyjoy’s story mirrors that of George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence, who betrayed his brother, King Edward IV, to align with his father-in-law, Richard Neville. In the TV series, Theon betrays Robb, who he was raised to think off as a brother, to gain the admiration of his natural father Baylon. Both were also separated from their natural parents at a young age, although George's father was killed at the Battle of Wakefield, while Theon was simply sent to live with the Starks. Joffrey was a ruthless ruler who was cruel to his betrothed, Sansa. Edward Plantagenet was also known for his cruelty, especially to his wife, but was never ruled as he was killed on the battlefield aged 17 . Known for an almost unmatched cruelty, Joffrey was one of the last people on Earth you would want to have any semblance of power, let alone rule a kingdom. As was the case with Edward Lancaster, who is generally portrayed as a sadistic, bloodthirsty boy who was cruel to his wife, Anne Neville, aka Sansa Stark. As the son of Mary of Anjou, the historical counterpart of Cersi, who is Joffrey's mother in the series, he was also heir apparent to the English throne. Luckily for the English, he died aged 17 on the field of battle. Unfortunately for the Kingdom of Westeros, Joffrey didn't.","Game of Thrones is loosely based on historical Wars of the Roses .

"By . Associated Press . Mike Ramirez is a high school football player who spent most of his time on the bench last season and works part-time at a local McDonalds. Caitlyn is a Texans cheerleader whose life is devoted to intense workouts, coaching tumbling classes and studying communications at the University of Houston. Yet 10,000 retweets later, the two are a prom couple. For 'Big Mike,' as he's been known to his friends since his sophomore year at Crosby High School in suburban Houston, it all started as a joke during 3rd period, when Caitlyn followed him on a 'Twitter following spree.' High school student Michael Ramirez, right, and Houston Texans cheerleader Caitlyn pose for pictures outside a restaurant before attending the prom on May 10 . Hi there! Ramirez is seen meeting and hugging Caitlyn. On her Twitter, Caitlyn wrote, 'Meeting @big_mike_71 for the first time!' Big date: Caitlyn seemed to enjoy herself, and captioned this photo 'Dinner was great!!! Now time for PROM' 'I was all like, ""What if I took a Texans cheerleader to prom?""' Ramirez recalled asking his classmate. ""He was like, that would be pretty cool."" So Ramirez sent Caitlyn a message. 'If I get 10,000 retweets will you go to prom with me (insert smiley face.) you will get asked in a cute way!' 'Of course I will,' responded Caitlyn, who according to Texans' policy isn't allowed to give her last name. 'Alrighttt!' Ramirez exclaimed. The whole squad is here! Caitlyn shared a snap of herself at dinner with Ramirez...along with her fellow Texans cheerleaders . Family: 'With my HTC Sisters!!' Caitlyn tweeted regarding this image . Having fun? Caitlyn snapped a selfie of herself and other promgoers - including young men wearing superhero logos - with the caption 'SUPERHERO SELFIES #HTCTakesProm' Night to remember: Ramirez and Caitlyn are seen posing at the Texas teen's prom . Twenty-seven hours later, the high school senior who had recently broken up with his girlfriend had a date — as well as a lot a series of semi-envious, semi-genuine 'attaboy' tweets from friends and dozens of new Twitter followers. 'It was just as a joke,' Ramirez said. 'I didn't think I was going to actually get it.' And he really didn't think it would attract attention beyond Crosby, a town of 2,300 people on the outskirts of Houston. That one Twitter message, though, made Ramirez's prom a bit more than he originally had in mind. Not only are there TV cameras and microphones eager to talk to him about the whole thing, his date was a bit of mystery. The Texans decided the prom would be a blind date. All Ramirez knew about Caitlyn before they met was that her favorite color is pink and she likes sushi. Fun time! Caitlyn and Mike posed in a photo booth with other prom attendees . This image provided by Mike Ramirez shows the tweet Ramirez sent to Houston Texans cheerleader Caitlyn . The two met Saturday night at Churrascos, an upscale Latin American restaurant, for dinner before prom. Ramirez arrived first, with his mom, Monica Cortez, and eight friends of his friends. Then Caitlyn arrived in a limousine, and six other Texans cheerleaders in uniform were at the restaurant to support her. Ramirez opened the limo door for her, and she stepped out and gave him a hug. They exchanged a corsage and boutonniere. Journalists were surrounding the limo when it arrived. When asked if there would be a second date, Michael indicated that he was hopeful for one — or even a wedding, he said jokingly. As for Caitlyn, she said, 'I plead the fifth.' They were headed to prom at the Houston Museum of Natural Science after dinner. From March until Saturday, the two had tried to go about their lives as normally as possible. Ramirez worked his shifts at McDonald's, juggling interview requests in between. He hung out at the park with his friends. He tried on tuxedos with his mother, and played with his younger sisters. Caitlyn continued her university class schedule, while intensifying workouts and hip-hop dance classes ahead of cheerleader tryouts in April. Officially on the team for a second year, she adjusted her schedule to continue teaching tumbling classes while going to practice — and doing media interviews. Ramirez's mother, meanwhile, tried to get a handle on it all. Cortez opened a Twitter account for the first time to help her son with retweets. Quickly, though, she became more adept. She congratulated the couple, and thanked Caitlyn in 140 characters. Then she started taking screenshots of Ramirez's Twitter page as the interview requests piled up, telling him who to call and when. 'It's a little overwhelming,' she said, wearing a red Project Graduation T-shirt while volunteering at a school fundraiser. Yet she's excited. Tears well up in her eyes. Her baby, she points out, is graduating. 'In the very beginning to me it was just one of his pranks because that's just who Mike is. He likes to play around and joke around a lot, but I figured if he set his mind to it, it would work out,' Cortez said. In this Nov. 17, 2013, file photo, Houston Texans cheerleader Caitlyn watches from the sideline during the second half of an NFL football game against the Oakland Raiders in Houston .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Eight race horses were killed when a fire tore through the Kentucky barn they were housed in. Trainer Gerry Carwood says the horses died in the early Friday morning inferno that started around 1.00 a.m. He saved two other thoroughbreds before firefighters arrived, but they were too late to rescue the others. The suburban Lexington barn was rented to Carwood by the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission’s executive director, according to Reuters. Inferno: The barn went up in flames shortly before 1.00 a.m. Friday morning . ‘I ran down to the barn and I could hear everybody kicking and screaming, but it was too hot,’ Carwood told WKYT. ‘I couldn't go in. I tried to go in but I couldn't.’ The heartbroken Carwood trained all the horses that died in the blaze. ‘The outside barn was on fire and I managed to get those two horses out,’ he continued. ‘I pulled one out of the barn that was on fire. I brought him around to the other horse, opened up his stall and he ran out behind him.’ Workers at an airport control tower miles away called 911 after spotting the flames at about the time Carwood was scrambling to save his animals. Raging: Firefighters battled the blaze for hours but were unable to save the eight horses that perished . Burned to the ground: Charred embers were all that remained of the barn as the sun came up Friday morning . ‘For them to see it, it was way too involved for us to be able to save it,’ a Lexington Fire Department spokesperson told Reuters. ‘From the time it was actually noticed until we got here...you do the math, five, six, seven, eight, 10 minutes. It's going to quickly consume a building that's an old tobacco barn, I'm being told,’ Battalion Chief Mark Harvey told WLEX. Both Harvey and the property’s owner described Carwood as shaken by morning’s events. A neighbour told WKYT that she saw a ‘big wall of fire… sparks flying really high and smoke billowing.’ She also called the blaze ‘very tragic’ and said she ‘wouldn’t wish that upon anyone.’ A single firefighter was injured battling the blaze when he hurt his shoulder. The cause is still under investigation.","Two horses were saved from the raging inferno by their trainer .

'A lady doesn't like to talk about age, but we live in a time that age and everything else about a person is available online,' she told the station. 'If I book an anti-aging campaign or fitness campaign, it would at least be a little more worth everyone continuing to talk about my age.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A pair of Italian designers have come up with a rather ingenious way to keep your cookbooks free of sauce, flour and any other baking supply or byproduct  that could potentially end up covering a good meatloaf recipe: Tattoos. Designers Marina Cinciripini and Sarah Richiuso have designed a collection of temporary tattoos that can be applied to a cook's forearm and act as guides for several classic Italian meals. The duos slogan: 'Roll up your sleeves.' Tats: Italian designers have created temporary tattoos that are recipes you can apply to your arm . Designers: Italian designers Marina Cincirpini and Sarah Richiuso created the tattoos for a design contest in 2013 . Cinciripini and Richiuso initially designed the tattoos for a design competition in 2013. The pair came in second in that contest in the 'ritual' category. 'The project plays down traditional behavior, that of food preparation . through cookbooks,' the pair says of their idea. 'Food conveying a message through the original use of . the body, which becomes support of image guidance for the creation of a . recipe.' Some of the current recipes are for classic Italian meals like grandmother artichokes and spaghetti with dried tomatoes and anchovies. Temporary: The tattoos come in packs of four that cost about $14 per pack . Traditional: Most of the recipes are traditional Italian cuisine like pastas with peppers and artichokes . The tattoos are currently available in four packs that cost about $14 a piece. The only downside is each tattoo is only for a single use - assuming the cook showers regularly, of course.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Flowers in bloom are one of the great joys of spring, but when viewed under a colour scanning electron microscope (SEM), they reveal an even greater surreal, alien-like beauty. From rose petals to arnica stigmas, and hibiscus stamens to pollen grains, a German photographer has captured the images with the help of a biologist from the German microscopy team at Eye of Science. The process of preparing the flowers to be photographed takes days of meticulous drying and coating in order to capture the beauty without the samples disintegrating. The images, including this shot of a rose petal, were taken by photographer Oliver Meckes and biologist Nicole Ottawa. The pair took the shots using a colour scanning electron microscope.  Roses are ancient symbols of love. It is national flower of England, as well as the provincial flower of Alberta, Canada. In the 15th century, Henry VII introduced the Tudor rose - a red rose for the House of Lancaster and a white rose for the House of York - after civil wars that became known as the War of the Roses . ‘Flowers are beautiful in ""normal'"" view, but when you look closer, some parts get very bizarre and unexpected structures appear - flowers within flowers, worlds within worlds,’ Meckes said. For a decade the pair, based in Reutlingen in the south of Germany, worked with an SEM they saved from the scrapheap, but for the last five years they have used a £250,000 FEI Quanta Series Field Emission SEM. The breathtaking shots show that these floral displays did not evolve to please our human senses, but instead serve the single purpose of attracting insects that will help pollinate the plant and allow it to reproduce. To prepare the specimens, Meckes and Ottawa took small pieces of each flower petal or leaf and put them through a dehydration process, before immersing them in 100 per cent alcohol. Meckes and Ottawa took small pieces of the flower petal or leaves and put them through a dehydration process, before immersing them in 100 per cent alcohol. This image shows the surface of a rapeseed flower petal that resembles the scaly skin of a lizard or snake. Rapeseed is a member of the same family as the mustard and cabbage family, Brassicaceae. Its oil was produced in the 19th century as lubricant for steam engines and, more recently, is used as diesel biofuel . The stigma of an arnica flower is pictured left, which reveals the top part of the female reproductive structure, known as the carpel. It resembles a spiky tongue. The anther of a flower of the small-leaved lime is pictured right. The anther is the part of the flower that collects the pollen from the stamen that produces it . Four lilac flower pollen grains pictured on a petal of the purple plant. The grains resemble a human brain and vary significantly to the bright red grains photgraphed on the coltsfoot, and the spiky grey grains of the arnica plant also captured by the Eye of Science microscopy team . Later, the alcohol was replaced with carbon dioxide in a pressure chamber to carry out what the team called the ‘critical-point’ step of the drying process. This meticulous method has been designed to maintain the appearance of the the sensitive and delicately thin surface of each plant - without which, the cells would collapse and the flowers would disintegrate. After being mounted on an aluminium platelet, each specimen was then coated in gold before being photographed. In one image, a close up shot of a rose petal resembles rows of raspberries, while the surface of a rapeseed flower looks like the scaly skin of a lizard or snake. This image shows pollen grains, shown in grey, on the yellow stigma of the arnica flower. Arnica is also known by the names Mountain Tobacco. The flowers  contain a toxin called helenalin, which can be poisonous if ingested in large amounts and has been known to cause gastroenteritis. Touching the plant can also cause skin irritation. Its name is believed to come from the Greek arna, which means lamb because of the plants soft, hairy leaves . This shot taken of a rapeseed leaf, with the light hitting the specimen from behind, makes it appear like a section of coral deep under the sea. After being submerged in alcohol, the liquid was replaced with carbon dioxide in a pressure chamber to carry out the final step of the drying process. This meticulous process has been designed to maintain the appearance of the sensitive and delicately thin surface of each plant - without which, the cells would collapse . After being mounted on an aluminium platelet, each specimen was then coated in gold before being photographed. The left-hand image shows the bright red pollen of the coltsfoot flower, and resembles cod roe. The hibiscus flower is renowned for its bright red and pink petal, but its stamens, pictured right, look almost dull in comparison. Tiny, spiky pollen grains are attached to the curved tips. The surface resembles the skin of an elephant . Another shot taken of a rapeseed leaf, with the light hitting the specimen from behind, makes it appear like a section of coral deep under the sea. In two of the images, Meckes and Ottawa capture pollen grains sat on the petals of arnica and lilac flowers. The arnica image resembles bacteria and its grey pollen grains look menacing with their sharp edges. By contrast, the pollen of the lilac is yellow and round and resembles the human brain. The stigma of the same arnica specimen in a separate image looks like a spiky tongue. Small yellow grains of pollen are scattered on the petal hairs of a marigold. The golden colour of the marigold gives the rubber gloves of the same colour its name. Potted marigold florets are edible and used to add colour to salads, or as a garnish. The flowers were used in ancient Greek, Roman, Middle Eastern and Indian cultures as a medicinal herb as well as a dye for fabrics, foods and cosmetics . The image on the left shows the floret of a chamomile flower, while the right-hand image is of a valerian flower which resembles the face of a bug. The Valerian root is often used to treat anxiety and sleeping disorders. It was used in ancient Greece and Rome,  and Hippocrates is thought to have been the first to link it to relieving insomnia. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia . By stark contrast, the pollen of the coltsfoot flower is shown as bright red, and resembles cod roe. The pair have previously used their SEM to take artistic images of bacteria, parasites, and butterflies to herbs, water bears, plant poisons and silverfish. ‘Working in the microscopic dimensions has completely changed our view of the world,’ Meckes said.","Images were taken by Eye of Science microscopy photographer Oliver Meckes and biologist Nicole Ottawa .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Any male, graduating seniors at Lowell High School in San Francisco must first report to the school's 'head penis inspector' Richard L. Dong for their mandatory penis inspection before their officially allowed to graduate. That's according to a rather official looking flier that was distributed throughout the school last week, on which an illustration of a patriotic penis and the slogan 'no penis left behind' also appears. Believe it or not, penis inspector Richard L. Dong is not real, and Lowell High School doesn't actually require its seniors to pass a penis inspection before they're allowed to graduate - rather, school officials believe the amusing fliers are just a senior prank orchestrated by members of the school's graduating class. Pranksters: School officials believe the amusing fliers were part of a prank pulled by graduating seniors . 'Late Monday afternoon, fliers announcing a phony inspection notice for . students were posted in the halls of Lowell High,' the school district says in a statement obtained by SFGate.com. 'The fliers, which mentioned a male body part, were . removed and the dean of students at Lowell is investigating. Lowell . administration is regarding this incident as a senior prank, and the . infractions will be addressed according to school and district . policies.' The pranksters - who explain on the fliers that circumcised and non-circumcised students must report to different locations to complete their inspection, and also that anyone with an erection will be given a failing grade - are not the first to pull the 'mandatory penis inspection' stunt. In fact, the penis inspection prank has become somewhat common amongst graduating seniors at Bay area high schools . Tradition: Lowell High School (pictured) is just the latest of several San Francisco Bay-area schools to fall victim to the penis inspection prank . In 2012, Castro Valley High School - just across San Francisco Bay from Lowell High School - was the victim of a similar prank when a flier that was nearly identical to the one passed around Lowell High School was distributed throughout the school. In 2011, the same thing happened at Carlmont High School just south of San Francisco. Just in case any students have any questions about their mandatory penis inspections, they're instructed to contact Mike Hawk - the 'director of Genital Commissions.'","A flier was passed around Lowell High School in San Francisco claiming that students who didn't pass a mandatory penis inspection would not graduate .
