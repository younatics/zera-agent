"A body has been found in woodland close to the Washington home of a six-year-old girl who went missing at the weekend. The remains, which were discovered by a K9 team at about 11.30am on Thursday, have not been formally identified, but police believe they belong to Jenise Wright. After her parents reported her missing on Sunday, more than 100 people, including a FBI team, had joined the search for Jenise. Missing: Jenise Wright disappeared at the weekend. Police believe a body found in woodland may be her . No arrests have been made, and the cause of death has not been revealed but formal identification and results from the autopsy are expected to take place Friday. In a statement, the sheriff's department . said a coroner will make official confirmation but 'it . appears that the body is that of Jenise.' At a press conference on Thursday afternoon, Kitsap County Sheriff's Deputy Scott Wilson said: 'This is going to be a criminal investigation. There's no doubt about that.' Wilson confirmed that police were waiting on . the autopsy results to determine the manner of death, but added: 'We . suspect that she just did not go off by herself and fall into some . bushes and die.' Dozens . of officers from more than 15 law enforcement agencies had been involved in a door-to-door search at the mobile home park where Jenise lived near . Bremerton, on the west side of Puget Sound, across from Seattle. She was last seen when she went to bed Saturday night. Her parents waited a day before calling for help because they say the girl had wandered around the Steele Creek Mobile Home Park on her own in the past. Loss: Jenise was last seen on Saturday night, in her trailer park home in Washington . Search: Police had gone door-to-door looking for Jenise. A body was found in woodland on Thursday morning . Wilson had said the family felt it was relatively safe for Jenise, who was described as being outgoing and unafraid to talk to anyone, because the mobile home park is fenced . Police have taken surveillance video from nearby businesses and checked in with sex offenders in the county. After the search began for Jenise, state child welfare workers removed two other children, an eight-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl, from the home. Court records show Jenise Wright's father, James Wright, was charged more than a decade ago with molesting two girls, ages 8 and 15. He eventually pleaded guilty in Whatcom County Superior Court in December 2001 to a misdemeanor assault charge related to the older girl. It was not immediately clear why the molestation charges were dropped. Prosecutors there did not return calls from the Associated Press. Confident: Jenise was described by her family as an outgoing child who would talk to anyone . A judge in Whatcom County Superior Court sentenced Wright to a year in jail but suspended the entire jail term on the condition that he follow certain conditions, including paying fees. Wilson said at a news briefing on Wednesday that authorities were aware of the past charge against the father, but that officers are focused on finding the girl. 'That has nothing to do with this investigation right now,' he said. Authorities searched all 103 homes and every outbuilding and vehicle in the Steele Creek Mobile Home Park.","K9 team led police to remains close to where Jenise Wright disappeared .

"A Puerto Rican kite surfer who saved a turtle from fishing nets was rewarded for his actions with a hug from the endangered sea creature. The underwater rescue and touching encounter with the turtle afterwards was filmed on a GoPro camera at the start of the year by two friends who were spear fishing off Baja on the Mexican coast. When kite surfer Cameron Dietrich and Colin Sutton spotted the distressed sea turtle they quickly dived in the ocean to try to rescue it. Scroll down for video . Touching: A sea turtle swims nose-to-nose with Cameron Dietrich after he freed it from tangled fishing nets . Rescue: Dietrich uses a dive knife to cut away the tangled mess of nets that had wrapped around the turtle . 'When I saw the turtle tangled up I jumped in the water and began to cut it free,' Dietrich told MailOnline. 'It was totally worn out from fighting for its life for last probably 12 to 20 hours.' Using a dive knife, Dietrich carefully cut away the tangle of rope and netting that had wrapped itself around a front fin, while Sutton helped the turtle to float. Once it had been freed, Dietrich described how he stayed beneath the turtle to make sure it had the strength to swim after its traumatic experience. Reassured that the turtle was going to be fine, Dietrich swam away from it, stopping a short distance away to watch the creature. But in an unexpected move, the turtle slowly circled back and returned to the surfer, stopping inches from his face and letting him gently hold it, as if to say thanks. Dietrich and his friends spotted the turtle in distress while they were spear fishing off the Mexico coast . Colin Sutton films on a GoPro camera as Dietrich dives in to help the turtle . 'It returned back to me on top of my chest and came right up to my face and . let me touch its under shell,' he said. 'It got right up to my mask then swam off.' 'For me, it was an unusual and wonderful moment,' he added. 'After it came up to my face it swam off into the blue straight.' Since the video of the touching rescue was uploaded on YouTube earlier this month it has been viewed more than 1.9 million times. The friends work quickly to free the sea turtle, which calmly allowed Dietrich to get close . The freed sea turtle started to swim away before suddenly turning back towards Dietrich . The turtle swims over to Dietrich and lets him embrace it .

"His energy and enthusiasm would put presenters half his age to shame. But after nearly a decade of hosting Strictly Come Dancing, it seems Sir Bruce Forsyth is finally beginning to feel the weight of his 84 years. For the first time, the entertainer will take a holiday mid-series to recuperate from the strain of hosting the Saturday night shows. He seemed to struggle once or twice with the timing of his jokes on this weekend’s programme, but still happily warmed up the 500-strong audience beforehand with a combination of gags and song routines. Break: Sir Bruce Forsyth, pictured with Strictly co-host Tess Daly, will take a holiday mid-series . Off-stage, a crew  member was on hand to guide him past the judges’ podium to make sure he did not trip over a set of steps. Co-presenter Tess Daly (right) will stand in as host for Sir Bruce (left), with her usual role taken by Claudia Winkleman . More than 9.9million tuned in to watch on Saturday, with Jerry Hall putting in a poor performance that saw her booted out of the competition in last night’s result show. Strictly easily beat its ITV rival the Factor, which was watched by only 8.2million. Sir Bruce negotiated the week-long break with producers before filming on the tenth series began in September. He will miss one show, on November 10, so he can rest before the following week’s live episode at Wembley Arena. His co-presenter Tess Daly will stand in as host, with her usual role taken by Claudia Winkleman. It will be the first time Sir Bruce, last month named as the longest-serving male TV entertainer by Guinness World Records, has voluntarily missed a show. Three years ago, doctors ordered him to pull out of one episode when he contracted flu. Yesterday, a Strictly spokesman said: ‘Even national treasures are allowed to take a week off. Sir . Bruce is taking a short break so he can be on top form and fighting fit . for the Children in Need show at Wembley the following week. Since this article was published, it has been brought to our attention that the mid-series break which Sir Bruce is taking was planned well in advance and was not arranged to allow him to take a rest from the show. Busy schedule: Despite reportedly  feeling the strain, Bruce was on the mic as he attended the Arora Ball at the Sofitel Hotel at London's Heathrow Airport over the weekend, alongside Lord Jeffrey Archer .

"A New York waiter had an unexpected bonus on Wednesday night when a diner left him a $1,000 tip on a $114 check. Michael Shafts never suspected that the couple celebrating a birthday at The Ginger Man in Albany were planning a surprise. As they were preparing to leave, the wife said quietly to Shafts: 'My husband has done something special for you.' Treat: A customer celebrating his birthday on Wednesday left server Michael Shafts a $1,000 tip . Thrilled: Credit union worker Michael Shafts, who works part time at the Albany restaurant, was shocked by the generous tip . When Shafts, who works part time at the restaurant alongside his job at a credit union, collected the check, he saw the man had left a personal message and a 878 percent tip. 'It was surreal. I was shaking. I couldn’t feel my legs,' he told the Times Union. The customers, who have not been identified, have visited the restaurant before but are not regulars at The Ginger Man. Shafts said the couple had been celebrating the husband's 47th birthday, and had brought a bottle of 47-year-old wine with them to enjoy with their meal. The man had written on the receipt, 'My birthday present to me. Pay it forward!' Shafts says he was shocked by the generous tip. 'I shook his hand, I hugged him twice, and I said it was too much, twice. Unexpected: The owners of The Ginger Man say the $1,000 tip is the largest any staff member has received . 'He insisted, twice, that he wanted to do it, that it was legitimate,' Shafts said. Restaurant owner Julie Bryon said it was the largest tip any of her staff had received. 'I was stunned. I shook my head and said, ""I'm sorry can you please open up your book again"",' she told All Over Albany. 'He's a very hardworking young man. It couldn't have happened to a nicer person!' Despite his unexpected windfall, Shafts finished his shift at the restaurant. He also shared more than half the tip with the other servers and kitchen staff.","Diner left message on receipt saying 'My birthday present to me'

"Food critics have pounced on Bill de Blasio again after the New York Mayor was spotted eating pizza in Italy with a knife and fork. De Blasio may have been returning to his family homeland with a trip to Naples, but he appeared to have forgotten his city roots when he reached for the cutlery. It is not the first time the mayor has made a pizza faux pas. Fewer than ten days into his term this year, he caused outrage among his constituents for the way he ate the city's famous dish. Food critic: Mayor of New York Bill de Blasio uses a knife and fork to eat a slice in Naples, where he is vacationing with his family . City living: De Blasio proves he does know how to eat like a New Yorker as he tucks into a pizza made by Gino Sorbillo, right, in Naples . At the time he had claimed that using cutlery was a cultural hangover from his family's Italian roots. 'In my ancestral homeland it is more typical to eat with a fork and knife. And I have been in Italy a lot and I’ve picked up the habit for certain types of pizza,' he said in January. But his method is one that New Yorkers have variously described as 'blasphemous,' a 'cardinal sin,' and 'unacceptable' on Twitter. As any New Yorker knows, the preferred method for eating a slice of pizza is to fold it in half and eat it with your hands. Bad form: De Blasio's approval among New Yorkers dropped when he ate a slice with a knife and fork at Goodfellas in Staten Island in January . Roots: Bill de Blasio is presented with a personalized pizza as he visits the Italian town his ancestors came from . Still, there could be some hope for de Blasio, who is currently vacationing in Italy with his wife Chirlane, and children Dante and Chiara. After being spotted using his knife and fork at lunchtime, the mayor was later seen apparently having a lesson in New York eating styles, as he devoured a slice that had been folded in half. As well as learning how to eat pizza like a true New Yorker, the mayor and his family are due to visit the town where his grandmother lived before immigrating to the U.S. in the early 1900s.","Bill de Blasio was spotted using knife and fork while eating pizza .

"The mother of a 12-year-old girl from Wisconsin, who collapsed and died hours after having the HPV vaccination, is questioning whether the jab may have been to blame. Rebecca Prohaska is so desperate for answers as to why her fit and healthy daughter, Meredith, died that she agreed for medical examiners to take the girl's brain away for testing. Meredith, who loved to play basketball, was given the routine vaccine offered to all children of her age just hours before she died. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Meredith Prohaska died suddenly on July 30, just a few hours after having the HPV vaccine . Distraught: Rebecca Prohaska is desperate for answers as to why her daughter died, but results from toxicology tests could take months . When she returned home from the doctor's appointment, the 12-year-old complained of feeling sleepy, and napped for much of the day. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. Although in many cases the virus goes away by itself, and may cause no symptoms, it can cause genital warts or cervical cancer. Two vaccines have been introduced in the U.S. to be given to schoolchildren aged 11 to 12. The vaccine is given at a young age because it offers the best protection before a person has become sexually active. The vaccine in not compulsory in every state, though Wisconsin, where Meredith was from, is one of several that has legislation that requires having the vaccine, or educating families about its benefits. But when Mrs Prohaska returned home from picking up dinner at about 4pm, she found her daughter face down on the living room floor. She had vomited, her lips were purple, and she wasn't breathing. Meredith was rushed to hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Doctors have so far been unable to give a reason for why the seemingly healthy schoolgirl died. 'It was the hardest thing when they called and said they don’t know. There was no reason. She was the healthiest 12-year-old,' Mrs Prohaska told the Journal-Sentinel. Both she and her husband, Mark, suspect the HPV vaccine may have played a role because it was the only thing different on the day Meredith died. “It has to be that vaccine,” Mark Prohaska told Fox6. 'I’m a tough guy. I can take a beating - but this has ripped a hole in my heart.' Heartbroken: Meredith's parents and siblings are struggling to come to terms with the sudden loss of the healthy 12-year-old . The couple are waiting for the results of several tests for possible toxins or disease-causing microorganisms, but it could take months before they have the answers they so desperately need. Although they suspect the vaccine may have played a part in their daughter's death, Dr Geoffrey Swain told Fox6 that severe side effects were rare and that the HPV jab had few risks. 'Vaccines in general and the HPV vaccine in particular, very, very safe. It’s a very safe vaccine and very effective,' he said.","Meredith Prohaska's family are waiting for test results to find out what caused her sudden death .

"Wonga, the payday loan company, has been required to write off £220million of debts for 330,000 customers. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has taken action because Wonga had been granting loans to customers without checking that they could afford the repayments. Back in June, the same company admitted to sending fake letters from fictitious law firms to customers in arrears, attempting to frighten them into repaying debts. For this cruel deception they paid £2.6m in compensation. Now these are not the actions of a commercially acceptable enterprise. Rather, they are the squalid manipulations of legalised loan sharks, whose profits are plundered from the distressed and the desperate. And this is the company whose name continues to disfigure the shirt of Newcastle United Football Club. Newcastle's shirt, as worn by midfielder Remy Cabella, features the logo of payday loan company Wonga . The point has been made repeatedly, not least in these pages, that the presence in football of these chancers, with their annual interest rates of up to 5,853 per cent, demeans not only the club, but the game itself. Yet when the matter is raised with contacts at the club, the responses are recited like a familiar script: ‘They’re not doing anything illegal … their money’s as good as any- one’s ... £32m over four years is too much to turn down.’ The Newcastle owner, Mike Ashley, feels no need to explain this or any of his decisions; indeed, one imagines him staring at the bottom line and smiling at the fuss. Then there is his manager, Alan Pardew. When the Wonga deal was signed, precisely two years ago, Pardew greeted it with the Pollyanna enthusiasm of a born company man. ‘Now there’s no reason why we can’t be one of the top-four clubs,’ he boasted. ‘I listened to the owner (of Wonga) and their customer satisfaction levels are higher than any other bank or lending facility… When Wonga have been involved in football clubs they’ve been very successful. If our fans do have any concerns, maybe they should contact Blackpool supporters and see how they’ve done. The feeling I get is that Blackpool fans have been happy with Wonga and what they’ve done for the club.’ It was almost too easy to snigger at his crass misjudgment. Pardew cited Blackpool as evidence of the benefits that legalised loan sharks can bring to football. In this case, it appeared to involve a cheque of undisclosed proportions and a half–time competition which featured a giant Wonga logo hanging from the goal in front of the North Stand. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley (right) talks with managing director Lee Charnley at the Liberty Stadium . A lucky fan was invited to walk out on to ‘the hallowed Bloomfield Road turf’ and strike a football through the ‘O’ of Wonga. Success brought him a £150 prize. Unfortunately, most people missed this pantomime, since they preferred to go off for a cup of tea and complain about the first half. The last time I looked, one bookmaker was offering odds of 1-20 on for poor old Blackpool to be relegated to League One. I was up there for a pre–season game, and I must tell the starry-eyed Pardew that the fans were deeply unhappy with just about every aspect of their car-crash of a football club. If anybody uttered a word in praise of Wonga, then I missed it. For they understood exactly what attracts such a company to a sadly down-at-heel seaside town. And Newcastle fans, in the heart of the recession-plagued North East, are similarly aware of the cynical strategy. Where there is poverty and stark insecurity, there is Wonga. Now it is clearly asking too much for men such as Ashley or Karl Oyston, the singularly charmless chairman of Blackpool, to recant, remove that objectionable shirt logo, renounce their ill-considered contracts, return the fees and face the consequences. Had they harboured the smallest scrap of sensitivity, then they would never have entered into such shameless agreements. But we are surely entitled to ask those who are charged with running the game to take a more civilised view. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew raises a smile as he arrives ahead of the match against Swansea . It is not an unreasonable request. The FA chairman Greg Dyke, the Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore and the Football League chairman Greg Clarke should jointly announce that payday loan firms should no longer be allowed to advertise their services through the sponsorship of shirts. They should point out that they are taking such action because of the damage to football’s image and the danger to football’s customers. And if they need moral and legal bases for their action, then they may find them in the closely-argued pages of the FCA report, which demonstrates their repugnant methods and their insatiable greed. The case has been made. It is time that football took its stand against the sharks. Racism is never a joke, Jose . By his own eccentric standards, Jose Mourinho’s season has been admirably restrained. Declining to court controversy or seek a cheap headline, he has obeyed the ancient cliché and let Chelsea’s football do the talking. But we sensed it was too good to last and, sure enough, he has broken cover with his assertion that ‘There is no racism in football’. Mourinho had been asked about the wisdom of the English game adopting a version of American Football’s ‘Rooney Rule’, which decrees that at least one black or ethnic minority candidate must be interviewed for every managerial post. He insisted that: ‘Football is not so stupid to close doors to people. If you are good, you get the job. If you are top, you are top.’ Now it is perfectly possible for people of open minds and good intentions to differ about the desirability of the Rooney Rule. But the notion that football is immune from the virus of racism is flagrantly absurd. Racism exists in the police, the media and in both Houses of Parliament. It exists in the Institute of Directors, the Trade Union Congress and in every branch of the Armed Services. Mercifully, it is far less widespread and its manifestations far less odious than once they were. But excavate the dark corners of our society and the evidence will be exposed. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho speaks during a press conference on Friday ahead of the Arsenal match . In any case, we cannot dismiss that deeply depressing statistic which tells us that while our 92 Premier and Football League clubs contain 25 per cent black players, only two have black managers. We can do much more to achieve decent, equitable, appropriate representation. An intelligent man like Mourinho is surely aware of this. We must therefore conclude that he is merely being mischievous. He has chosen the wrong subject and the wrong moment for his little jape. Time to revert to restraint. All hail Kimetto’s glorious triumph . In a weekend of a reckless Wayne Rooney and a breathless Ryder Cup, the deeds of Dennis Kimetto scarcely raised a flutter. Which was a great pity. Because the 30-year-old Kenyan completed the Berlin Marathon in 2hrs, 2min and 57sec, thus becoming the first man to go beneath 2hrs 3min for the distance. Imagine that: 26.2 miles at an average pace of around 4min 41.5sec per mile! It is beyond astonishing. Kenya's Dennis Kimetto gives the thumbs up after breaking the world record for the marathon in Berlin . Kimetto took a full 26 seconds off the previous record. Thirty years ago this month, the Welshman Steve Jones set a fine world record of 2.08.05. Kimetto would have left him almost a mile-and-a-half adrift. It is, of course, impossible to quantify. But as a measure of athletic excellence, I would suggest that it stands alongside Roger Bannister’s first sub-4-minute mile or the various world records set by Usain Bolt. Kimetto was humility personified. Kimetto raises his arm as he crosses the finish line during the 41st Berlin Marathon last Sunday . ‘I went to Berlin just to compete, but I thank God that I have come back as a world record holder,’ he said. ‘It was a surprise.’ It was much more than that. It was a glorious triumph of human endeavour. We shall count ourselves fortunate to see anything comparable in this sporting year. PS… . Joey Barton — the eminent linguist, professional provocateur and midfield scuffler — has been out of the public eye. And Joey hates to be ignored. So he decided to offer some unsolicited advice. Barton knows why Arsenal haven’t won the title for ten years. It’s Arsene Wenger. The Arsenal manager doesn’t like ‘warriors’, it seems. He can’t stand ‘shouters and bawlers’. And the result: ‘At the latter stages of a season they come unstuck because of that lack of — I hate to say it — a real lack of character or spine within the team.’ It was vintage Barton, more in sorrow than in anger. You just know that Wenger will be truly thankful.

"The decision to choose Sir Winston Churchill to feature on the new £5 note has sparked a furious backlash from feminist campaigners. The wartime Prime Minister will replace the image of prison reformer Elizabeth Fry on the new-look note will which start circulation in 2016. But the move has led to an online petition and a group of 46 MPs and peers yesterday asking for the decision to be reviewed. Icons: Author Charlotte Bronte or suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst could be candidates for the £5 note . One group of campaigners is currently . trying to raise funds for a legal challenge under the Equality Act. They would prefer to see author Mary Wollstonecraft or Crimean War nurse . Mary Seacole, who was born in Jamaica, on the note. Only . two women have appeared on modern banknotes since their inception in . 1970 - Elizabeth Fry, who first appeared on notes in 2002, and nurse Florence Nightingale, who was on the £10 . note from 1975 to 1994. As anger about the choice escalated, the Bank of England admitted it did . choose a woman as a 'contingency' option. But the Bank refused to reveal who . the woman was, saying it might 'prejudice' the selection process for . people to appear on the next round of banknotes. Although the Bank maintains its silence over the identity of the woman it chose as a 'contingency', it is expected she hails from a list of 83 influential women chosen by the public,The Times reported. The list includes Charlotte Bronte, Jane Austen and Emmeline Pankhurst. Anyone appearing on a banknote must meet strict criteria, including being 'uncontroversial', easily recognisable and having made an enduring contribution to society. There must also be photographs or paintings of them of a high enough quality to be featured on the notes. Honour: Great Briton Sir Winston Churchill is to appear on the new £5 note from 2016, the Bank of England has announced . Sir Mervyn expressed surprise at the uproar surrounding the decision to replace Fry with Churchill, who he described as a 'truly great British leader, orator and writer' and as 'entirely appropriate' for the note. He said: '(The decision was made) on the basis of choosing the right person and not on the basis of an artificial distinction by gender.' He pointed out that a woman - the Queen - is on every note. Campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez told the newspaper the remark was a 'spectacularly asinine point to make'. Hero: Sir Winston is regarded by many as the man who saved Britain from the clutches of Hitler's Nazi Germany . She added: 'Whatever we think about the Queen's hard work, she's there on the basis of birthright, not on the basis of her achievements.' When Sir Mervyn announced the news that Churchill would become the first politician of the modern era to feature on a banknote, he said he hoped the note would become known as 'a Winston'. His sentiments were echoed by the politician's grandson, Mid-Sussex Tory MP Nicholas Soames, who was at the ceremony along with other members of Churchill's family. Asked whether he thought the nickname would catch on, Mr Soames said: 'Of course it will. 'We are all going to go to Tesco and be . buying our groceries with Winstons, and that of course would have given . him more pleasure than anything.' The design will feature a renowned . portrait of the prime minister in defiant pose, taken by photographer . Yousuf Karsh in December 1941. Behind him is a view of the Houses of Parliament, with the hands on Big Ben showing three o'clock. Governor Sir Mervyn King made the . announcement during an event at Chartwell, Churchill's former home in . Kent, attended by members of his family. It reflects the approximate time of a statement to the House of Commons on May 13 1940 when he famously told MPs: 'I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.' The quote itself is also shown on the design. A background image shows the Nobel Prize for literature, with citation, awarded in 1953 to Churchill - who apart from being a politician was a prolific historical writer. Sir Mervyn said: 'Our banknotes acknowledge the life and work of great Britons. Sir Winston Churchill was a truly great British leader, orator and writer. Above that, he remains a hero of the entire free world. 'His energy, courage, eloquence, wit and public service are an inspiration to us all. I am proud to announce that he will appear on our next banknote.' Churchill's image replaces that of Elizabeth Fry, the philanthropist and penal reformer, who appears on current notes first issued in 2002. These will be phased out over two or three years, leaving no notes featuring the face of a famous woman - other than the Queen. Honour: In front of a portrait of the great man at his Chartwell home in Kent, Mervyn King, the Governor of the Bank of England hands the design  to Lady Soames, the only surviving child of Sir Winston . The choice of Churchill reflects the . fact that, though a political figure, he is widely revered across the . spectrum as the man who saved Britain in its darkest hour from the . fearful advance of Nazism across Europe. Another . war hero, the Duke of Wellington, is the only other prime minister to . have featured on a banknote image - the old £5 phased out in the 1990s. Churchill . had a long parliamentary career during which he served as home . secretary and chancellor before a spell in the political wilderness in . the 1930s when he warned of the increasing threat of German rearmament. In May 1940, he replaced Neville Chamberlain as prime minister in the newly-formed National Government. His leadership and brilliant oratory were credited with helping to steer Britain to victory. After war broke out Sir Winston Churchill became Prime Minister, replacing . Neville Chamberlain and leading the newly-formed National Government. As the country faced 'an ordeal of the most grievous kind', the 'British Bulldog', as the . Russians called him, stood up in the Commons on May 13 1940 and gave one of his most . famous speeches, declaring: 'I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, . tears and sweat'. These were the same words he had used when he met his cabinet for the first time earlier that day. He concluded with: 'Come then, let us go forward together with our . united strength.' Both are examples of the brilliance of his oratory. Winston Churchill became a patriotic icon, exemplar of leadership and a . national inspiration during the Second World War. Defeated in the . post-victory 1945 general election, he argued strongly for Western unity . against the threat of Communism. He was returned to office in 1951 and . finally retired in 1955, aged 80. Aged 90, he died on the morning of Sunday January 24, 1965. Defeated by Labour in the 1945 general election, he served again as prime minister from 1951 to 1955, when he retired aged 80. Churchill died in 1965 and was given a full state funeral, the first commoner to receive such an honour since Gladstone in 1898. He was also the first to feature on a British coin - the 1965 crown or five-shilling piece. Speaking in the grounds of Chartwell, Sir Winston's grandson, Mr Soames, said featuring on a bank note would have given the former wartime prime minister great pleasure. He said: 'He was an extraordinary man and his ability to capture the mood and the people's mood was one of his great gifts as a statesman. 'The design of the bank note, the quotation and the whole idea behind it is so appropriate and fitting, and my grandfather would have been truly very proud.' Asked why it had taken so long for Sir Winston to feature on a bank note, Mr King said he is the most recent figure to appear on any note. He said: 'Normally we allow a much longer period of time to elapse before we are willing to make a judgment. 'I think Churchill is a very obvious figure and I was very proud, as one of my last acts as governor, to put him on a bank note. 'We don't put many figures on. 'The first historical figure to appear on a bank note was only in 1970. 'We have only had 15 since so there are not many opportunities to make this decision and Churchill is only the second figure from the 20th Century.'","Bank of England admits it has chosen a woman as a 'contingency'

"Wales will consider switching prolific Lions wing, George North, into midfield for their autumn Test opener against Australia, if Jonathan Davies’ shoulder injury rules him out. North has been in sensational form for Northampton in the early stages of this season – touching down four times during Saturday’s 34-6 Champions Cup demolition of the Ospreys. That took his try tally to eight in as many matches, but the 22-year-old may be asked to move from his preferred position out wide, as emergency cover. Although Wales are hopeful that Scott Williams and Cory Allen could be fit to face the Wallabies, they will weigh up the option of unleashing North through the middle, as they did against the same opposition last year. ‘George went there (centre) last year against Australia,’ said assistant coach Rob Howley. George North scored four tries against Ospreys in the Champions Cup match at Franklin's Gardens . Jonathan Davies injured his shoulder playing for Clermont  on the Sunday and could miss the autumn Tests . ‘We think George isn’t a bad outside centre. He did okay on the wing as well on the weekend, which was fantastic to see. He was back to his Lions form. It is an option for us if we need to go there.’ That scenario will be pondered once the extent of Davies’ injury is known by head coach Warren Gatland and his assistants. Initial reports in France – where the Lions centre plays for Clermont Auvergne – suggested he may have dislocated his shoulder during the first half of Sunday’s win over Sale. Wales should have a clearer picture by Tuesday. ‘Jonathan had a bump on his shoulder and we are uncertain as to the extent of the injury,’ said Howley. ‘A scan has been organised. He obviously felt some pain and came off immediately. It is disappointing, but centre is a pretty attritional position now. It’s no different to other campaigns – we just have to get on and work with what we’ve got.’ Williams and Allen arrived in camp with hamstring and leg injuries respectively, but the Wales management believe they could be ready for the start of the autumn campaign. ‘Scott and Cory could potentially be fit for next week,’ said Howley. Head coach Warren Gatland has seen a number of his 34-man squad for the autumn Tests complain of injuries . Wales are hopeful that Scarlets centre Scott Williams could be fit to face Australia . Meanwhile, the Wallabies are prepared to summon controversial back Kurtley Beale to join their tour providing he proves his fitness – despite his latest disciplinary episode. The Waratahs player was suspended and then fined after being found guilty of sending an offensive text about a former member of the team’s back-room staff. Yet, it appears Beale once again has been forgiven by Australia and will be reintegrated soon. ‘Kurtley is back at home training,’ said defence coach, Nathan Grey. ‘He hasn’t played for a long time. We know he’s working hard, trying to get back up to speed with his physical condition and once he’s done that he will definitely be considered for selection. He could possibly join us on this tour once he gets back in shape.’ New Zealand fly-half Dan Carter expects to make a Test comeback against the USA on Saturday – putting him on course to face England at Twickenham a week later, after a year decimated by injuries. ‘I’m preparing to play that game,’ he said, of the sell-out fixture in Chicago. ‘I’m confident and the medical team are confident that I’ll be able to be selected. That’s what we’re targeting.’ Australia fly half and full back Kurtley Beale could be called into Australia's squad if he proves his fitness . Beale slips as he fails to kick a penalty against the British and Irish Lions in the first Test in June 2013 .","First choice centre Jonathan Davies injured himself playing for Clermont Auvergne against Sale Sharks on Sunday .

"A Washington mother whose two-year-old son died after taking meth pleaded not guilty to manslaughter in court Wednesday. Alyia Iverson is accused of leaving drugs where her son Nathan could find them, and then doing nothing to help after he overdosed in December 2012. Police claim that the 26-year-old failed to take action when she saw her son drink bong water. He took enough meth to cause an overdose in an adult, medical reports showed. Charges: Alyia Iverson, pictured in court Wednesday, pleaded not guilty to manslaughter over the death of her two-year-old son . Overdose: Nathan died in December 2012 after drinking bong water and eating enough meth to kill an adult, medical reports say . The toddler would have shown signs of distress, including having convulsions and a fever, police say. Prosecutor Mark Lindquist told KTVU it would have been 'painfully obvious' that the child was seriously unwell. 'Once the toddler ate that methamphetamine, there must have been a high fever, convulsions, maybe even seizures,' he said. Nathan and his sister had previously been put into care in 2011, but Iverson later regained custody of her children when allegations of neglect were ruled unfounded. It took more than 18 months for Iverson to appear at her arraignment because of investigations by police and child protection services. A Child Protective Service investigation into Nathan's death found that caseworkers should have tried harder to follow the child's progress 'due to significant risks associated with the case'. A report from the medical examiner found that Nathan died from acute methamphetamine poisoning and had also ingested THC, a component of marijuana. Claims: Prosecutors allege Iverson failed to raise the alarm and that her son, Nathan, would have been in obvious distress and pain after consuming drugs . When paramedics arrived at the house Iverson was staying in, Nathan didn't have a pulse, and they struggled to fit a breathing tube because his jaw had locked. According to KSDK, doctors treating Nathan at hospital noted that the child had several bruises and that his feet, finger nails and toenails were dirty. Iverson has been barred from having contact from children and is being held on $250,000 bail.","Alyia Iverson is accused of failing to call for help after her son overdosed .

"Against all odds: Grant Virgin was hospitalized for months after the hit and run that almost took his life . A California teenager left dead after a horrifying hit and run made a miraculous recovery – and his family says fish oil saved his . life. Grant Virgin’s long road to recovery began in September 2012 . after he was run over by a car. He was clinically dead until paramedics revived . him – but he suffered severe brain damage. The now-17-year-old also suffered a torn aorta, skull . fractures and bleeding on the brain, and bone and spine fractures, the Virgin . family told CNN. Doctors said he would likely not survive through the night. ‘It's like, how dare you not fight for my son's life?’ Mother JJ Virgin recalled. ‘It really took us ... getting very aggressive and . assertive to save our son's life, because they weren't going to do it. ‘They told us not to. They told us to let him go,’ she . continued. But the family, from Palm Desert, refused to accept that . Grant would not live to see another day. Police soon closed their investigation into the case having never found the person who hit the teen, according to the Desert Times, but his family fought on to save his life. She ever gae up: Doctors told mother JJ Virgin to let her son die, but she refused . Awake, but not himself: Grant Virgin eventually woke from his coma, but brain damage was so severe he barely resembled his former self . A long road back: The Virgin family began administering high doses of fish oil to Grant soon after he woke up . JJ Virgin, a renowned fitness expert, decided to try any and . everything she thought would help her son. The teen underwent several surgeries to stabilize his . condition, but his brain function did not dramatically improve – until a friend . suggested they try fish oil and progesterone. Progesterone has been shown in studies to reduce swelling on . the brain – though not when rubbed topically as the Virgin’s did. The suggestions came after a mine disaster survivor was left . brain dead but came back to almost complete normalcy after large doses of fish . oil. Remarkable results: Within two days, Grant (pictured with father John) was making phone calls home . Even more amazing: Grant was soon on his way home and walking again . He's out!: Grant Virgin being wheeled from the hospital by his siblings . Grant Virgin soon woke up and began speaking – but only with . a limited vocabulary, his family recalled. ‘Let’s go,’ he would say, ‘I love you,’ he often repeated. Improvement was slow at first, but it was noticeable. ‘When your kid is in a coma, and then coming out of a coma, . you watch every nuance,’ JJ Virgin told CNN. ‘If his eyelash fluttered, 'Oh, . his eyelash fluttered! ‘You're holding on to anything that you can see and . monitoring everything, every single day. And so it was very clear when the . acceleration happened. Really clear.’ Slowly returning to himself: Grant Virgin was soon starting to resemble himself again, even playing drums . Proud papa: Father John Virgin is relieved the fish oil therapy worked and that he has his son again . Still a work in progress: Grant Virgin still works daily with a speech therapist . The Virgin family started administering high doses of the . natural remedy to Grant to see if it would speed his recovery since the brain’s . cell wall is made of omega-3 fatty acids. ‘If you have a brick wall and it gets damaged, wouldn't you . want to use bricks to repair it?’ Dr. Michael Lewistold CNN. ‘By supplementing . using (omega-3 fatty acids) in substantial doses, you provide the foundation . for the brain to repair itself.’ Fish oil did not work, though, in every instance it was . tried, CNN notes, but the Virgin’s went ahead with the unorthodox therapy at a . dosage of 20-grams-per-day. The largest known dosage ever given to anyone. ‘If someone said to me, you know what, you can give him fish . oil, you can give him better nutrition, you'll get maybe 5% (improvement), I'll . take that,’ the mother said. JJ Virgin got a late night phone call only two days after . Grant started taking the fish oil. He's getting there: The teen's life is slowly returning to normal, he even plans to return to high school for his senior year . Giving back: Pirctured with mother JJ Virgin, Grant brought presents to ailing children being treated at the hospital where he almost died last year . 'A miracle': Workers at the hospital Grant healed in called him a miracle during his recent visit . ‘I get this call like midnight, and I'm asleep, and I wake . up the next morning and go, 'Did Grant call me and did we have this whole . conversation?’ she recalled. ‘I just remember waking up the next morning going, 'I must . have dreamed that, that couldn't have possibly happened.’ She drove to the hospital that morning in shock, two months . after doctors told her to ‘let him go,’ Grant Virgin was talking. ‘We had been told he'd never be able to recognize anybody, . he will never be able to focus his eyes, all the grim stuff,’ father John . Virgin told CNN. ‘[They said] the diffuse damage to his brain is so much that . he's never going to be Grant again,’ he continued. The teen hasn’t made a full recovery, he may never, but he . has recovered to a point far greater than anyone thought possible. Physically healed: The 17-year-old is fully healed physically, he has resumed weight lifting and other activities . Realization: Despite all the progress he's made, Grant Virgin knows he still has a lot of work to come fully back . A recent visit to the hospital he spent more than two months . in showed him greeted by a nurse calling him a ‘miracle.’ He returned with presents for 20 children and gave them out . while smiling, laughing and joking with the younger patients. ‘From when he first arrived compared to now is just night . and day,’ occupational therapist Elly Schoap, who works at the hospital, told . the Desert Times. ‘When he left us he was able to walk and talk, but he was . still very impaired. ‘This is why we work in this area,’ she continued. ‘To have . him come back and see this kind of success story is just amazing.’","Grant Virgin was clinically dead after being run over by a car until paramedics revived him .

"The bodies of a father and son from Minnesota, who went missing while hiking in the Rockies in April, were found Thursday. Damian McManus and his son Evan disappeared on April 2 while on a spring break hike in Colorado, in a week when the state experienced deep snowfall and sub-zero temperatures. The search for the men had been resumed by volunteer firefighters, and their bodies were found in Mount Evans at about 10am Thursday. Found: The bodies of Damian McManus and his son, Evan, were discovered on Thursday after the pair went missing in April . Trail: The father and son from Minnesota had been hiking in Mount Evans, Colorado . The Alpine and Rocky Mountain Rescue retrieved the bodies from the mountain, and a coroner is expected to officially identify them and investigate what caused their death. 'It appears the agonizing search is over,' Suzy Goldstein Lewis, a spokeswoman for the family, told the Star Tribune. McManus, 51, and his son, 18, had embarked on the impromptu trip while his wife Katherine, and Evan's twin sister Lauren were enjoying a vacation in Mexico. At first the women blamed poor cell phone reception on the lack of contact from their family, but once they arrived home in Minnesota they realized both men's phones were dead and that they were missing. Early search efforts were hampered by wintry conditions, with rescue teams having to use snowshoes and snowmobiles to try to find the pair. Closure: Damian, right, pictured with his wife Katherine and twins Evan and Lauren . Vacation: Damian had gone to the Rockies with Evan while his wife and daughter were visiting Mexico . It snowed every day for a week after the father and son were last heard from, covering their tracks and leading search teams to conclude that there was no way they could have survived the freezing temperatures. Their car was found early on by a lake popular with tourists, but snowfall had already covered their tracks. After the initial rescue attempt firefighters with mountaineering experience continued the search in their own time. Their expenses were covered by a private donation fund, Twin Cities reported.

"A father-of-five who used the Obamacare health exchange in Nevada to try to find cheaper insurance has been left with $1 million in medical bills because of a series of errors. Kynell Smith used the Nevada Health Link last year to sign up for a new health plan, but has experienced problems at every stage. Payments have been lost, his wife's details on her insurance card were inaccurate, and the couple have still not been able to enroll their baby girl, who was born prematurely in February, Smith claims. Stressful: Kynell and Amber Smith with their five children. The couple enrolled in the Affordable Healthcare Act but errors led to them being billed for more than $1 million in medical costs . Legal action: Smith plans to join a lawsuit being brought by others who have experienced similar problems when they tried to get health insurance . Smith has now turned to attorneys for help, after being unable to resolve the litany of errors that have led to him being billed for more than $1 million in medical bills. 'I think it's a disaster. I don't know who to blame, and I really don't care who's to blame,' Smith told News 3. 'I have spent countless hours on the phone trying to get this resolved. I have contacted and pleaded with elected officials to help and was told I may have to sue to get this resolved. What kind of answer is that?' The first problem for Smith was that the health plan he was quoted came in at nearly $1,600 a month - far higher than the existing Cobra plan he had been using. In December, he claims, a payment he made was lost, and in January his insurance group, Anthem, could not find any record for Smith's children after they had doctor appointments which meant the couple had to cover the cost themselves. Unexpected: The problems coverage coincided with Amber giving birth to the couple's fifth child. The baby had to spend time on a neonatal ward, and Amber spent more than a month in hospital after her appendix burst . Then in February, when the family's insurance cards arrived, they noticed the date of birth for Smith's wife, Amber, was wrong. The timing couldn't have been worse because she was pregnant with their fifth child, who was born prematurely at the end of the month. Because of complications and a burst appendix, Mrs Smith spent more than a month in hospital, and their daughter Kinsley was kept in a neonatal unit. Although the family's medical bills are not currently being paid for by their insurance, their monthly payments to the plan are still being taken. 'All I know is, I am sending checks and they are cashing them,' Smith told the Las Vegas Review Journal. 'They [providers] keep threatening to send me to collections.' Worries: Smith is still paying for the insurance, but he said the companies that provided medical treatment have threatened to send in collectors for the unpaid services . The family have contacted legal firm Callister, Immerman & Associates about joining a class-action lawsuit being brought by other people in Nevada who have suffered similar problems. Xerox, which runs the health exchange website, has released a statement saying the Smiths' case 'is a priority matter'. 'As you might imagine, this is a very complicated case involving many more companies than just xerox,' the statement said. A spokesman said the company was trying to ensure that all of their charges would be covered. Anthem, which is the family's health provider, also said it was working to resolve the problems, and said their case 'illustrates the frustrations we and the health exchange have had in dealing with Xerox.'","Kynell Smith is taking legal action after series of errors with Affordable Healthcare Act plan .

"A stranded fishing boat that became a symbol of the devastation of Japan's 2011 tsunami has long divided a northeastern coastal city - between those who wanted to keep it as a monument of survival and those who wanted a painful reminder gone. Last week, the city announced it will be torn down after a heated debate and citywide vote. The soul-searching over the ship highlights how the aftermath of the tsunami disaster continues to torment Japan two years later. The 330 metric ton Kyotokumaru was swept by the towering tsunami from the city's dock for about 750 meters into a residential district. Scroll down for video . Floral tributes laid by the 60-metre Kyotokumaru, pictured here last Sunday. The stranded fishing boat is standing in the residential district of Kesennuma, Miyagi prefecture, northern Japan . After much debate and a vote for or against, City officials finally announced last week that Kyotokumaru, which has become a symbol of the devastation of Japan's March 2011 tsunami, will be torn down . It has become a landmark for Kesennuma, a port city of 70,000 people, and a testament to the destructive power of the tsunami set off by the magnitude-9.0 earthquake on March 11, 2011, which killed nearly 19,000 people. The nearby smashed buildings and debris were cleared, but the 60-meter tuna-fishing boat has stood, majestic but oddly jarring, on dry ground for more than two years. Opinion on the ship had been so divided it had been put to a vote by the city residents last month. Of the 14,083 responses, 68 percent, or 9,622 people, voted to have the ship destroyed. Only 16 percent voted to keep it. Yoshimi Abe, a 72 year-old housewife and Kesennuma resident, was among those who wanted to get rid of the ship. Aerial view of Tsunami devastated Kamiishi city, Iwate prefecture, Japan, 13 March 2011. More than 650 people lost their lives and 390,000 people sought refuge in shelters . 'It's just a constant reminder of the terrible disaster,' she said. 'When I walk by it every morning, my heart aches.' The house that Abe grew up in was destroyed by the tsunami, and she now lives in temporary housing. In contrast, Shigeru Saito, 80, voted to keep the boat, which he saw as a plus for drawing business. 'My son owns a store in the temporary market near Kyotokumaru. Many of his customers are out-of-town visitors who drop by to see the ship,' he said. A man walks next to port area destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami in Kessenuma town, in Miyagi prefecture March 28, 2011 . Extraordinary sight: people looking at a catamaran thrown on top of houses by the tsunami . For now, Kyotokumaru still towers over the flattened neighborhood, its blue and red paint rusting, propped up with iron beams and fenced off with yellow tape. It's surrounded by bouquets of flowers left by people. They pray and take photos. Some just stand and stare. Much of the tsunami-hit region's rebuilding remains untouched. Fears grow about people, especially young people, leaving. Some areas will be ghost-towns for decades because of the radiation from the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant that went into multiple meltdowns. The Fukushima fishing company, which owns the Kyotokumaru, has signed a contract with a nonprofit organization that recycles ships. The dismantling is likely to start in the next few weeks. Kesennuma Mayor Shigeru Sugawara was disappointed the landmark would soon be gone. 'I wanted to leave a visible symbol of what happened here for generations to come,' said Sugawara. 'The decision has been made, and there's nothing much more we can do.'","330 ton Kyotokumaru tuna fishing boat was .

"Abandoned and overweight cat King Leo must have thought his days were numbered when he was cruelly dumped by a Nashville road last month. The 30lb cat, whose once long silky fur had become matted and filthy, had a change of fortune after a passing motorist heard his meows for help. Now Leo is slimming down and has a new home to rule over after one of the rescue workers caring for him fell in love with the cute cat and decided to adopt him. New look: King Leo had to be shaved because thick mats in his fur were preventing the overweight cat from moving . Huge task: When Leo was rescued, his long fur was so tangled he could barely move . Leo's rescue and transformation was all thanks to Animalia animal hospital and treatment center, in Franklin, and Nashville rescue center, Cat Shoppe and Dog Store. The 10-year-old cat was found by a driver who had pulled over with a flat tire. He heard Leo crying and discovered him locked inside an animal carrier by the roadside last month. A note inside the carrier revealed that Leo had been abandoned at least once before, when his first owners handed him over to a new family. Despite all the changes in his life, and the scary experience of being dumped by a road, Leo was soon making new friends. The portly pet has been put on a diet and gentle exercise regime and, because his fur was so matted, he was given a fancy new trim. Fresh start: King Leo is being cared for in Nashville after he was found dumped in a pet carrier by the roadside . Forever home: The abandoned cat has been adopted by a vet technician who has been caring for him at Animalia animal center . His thick and tangled fur was severely restricting the cat's ability to move, with mats on the belly preventing Leo from being able to extend his back legs. Not only did shedding his matted locks help Leo lose an extra 10.5oz, it has also made it easier for staff to keep an eye on his weight loss. King Leo has been taking the changes in his stride, and has been enjoying trips to the Cat Shoppe, where he holds court with customers. The store has been raising funds to help pay for his treatment - and that of other rescue cats - and had planned to help find him a new home, but one of the people caring for Leo has already stepped in to adopt him. One of the vet technicians - Tish - who helped cut away the thick mats in his fur, fell for Leo's charms and has come forward to offer a permanent home. Updates on the Cat Shoppe Facebook page show the remarkable progression from the disheveled, abandoned Leo, to a slightly slimmer and shaved cat, who loves to roll his back and have his belly rubbed. In just a few weeks, the results of his diet are already visible, and Leo is said to have lost 5lb already.","Overweight pet has new lease of life after being rescued by driver .

"Disappearance: Madeleine was nearly four years old when she vanished from Praia da Luz. Police are now investigating whether burglars were involved . British police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have been handed a confidential dossier on burglars in the Algarve by Portuguese officers. They kept the secret file because of a rash of burglaries in and near Praia da Luz, the resort where Madeleine went missing in May 2007 when she was three. Some children were abused during the burglaries. A businesswoman who works in nearby Lagos said the file mainly contains information on Portuguese and Romanian gypsies who break in in the middle of the night. 'It's been going on for years, well before Madeleine disappeared, she told the Sunday Express. 'Police here are aware of the problem but the public aren't aware.' Another mother claims kidnappers tried to abduct her baby girl after spiking her drink and trying to snatch the child while she was staying at Montechoro, 30 miles away from Luz. She said: 'It was terrifying, like something out of a film.' Britain's most senior police officer has suggested his officers are closing in on the people who abducted Madeleine McCann. Scotland Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe admitted his officers have the names of suspects and that ‘some progress’ is being made in the inquiry. But he declined to be drawn on when the suspects would be quizzed over her disappearance in Portugal seven years ago. Scene: Madeleine went missing from the Ocean Club (pictured) as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant . Missing: Madeleine McCann who vanished from her holiday resort in Praia da Luz in 2007 while her parents were having dinner . He told BBC’s Radio 5 Live: ‘We have sent three letters of request for international assistance to the Portuguese judiciary, because that is the way their system works. ‘We have got lines of inquiry which are different to the Portuguese Police’s and we are working with them to try to resolve that. 'We are making some progress.’ Asked by presenter Nicky Campbell whether his officers had the names of suspects, he replied: ‘That is correct’. He declined to comment further.

"Are we on the verge of a sex abuse scandal that will dwarf any of the previous outrages involving celebrities such as Jimmy Savile, Max Clifford and Rolf Harris? It certainly seems we may be. Almost every day brings new charges that suggest the Establishment may have protected ministers, MPs and high officials from investigation into allegations of abuse involving children going back 30 years and more. This is no sensationalist claim. Yesterday, a former senior Tory Cabinet Minister, Lord Tebbit, raised the incendiary idea that there ‘may well have been’ a political cover-up of sex abuse in the Eighties. Former senior Tory Cabinet Minister, Lord Tebbit, raised the incendiary idea that there 'may well have been' a political cover-up of sex abuse in the Eighties. It comes after the disappearance of a dossier alleging high-level paedophile activity, handed in 1983 by the late Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens to the then Home Secretary, Leon Brittan . Imagine the effect on public opinion if it were shown that some law-makers had been guilty of paedophilia, and that ministers and civil servants closed ranks to save these wrongdoers from prosecution. It would shatter people’s faith in our political institutions, and very possibly make the MPs’ expenses scandal look like a trivial rumpus. Of course, we don’t yet know how much sex abuse took place, or the extent of any cover-up. A thorough examination of the evidence might conclude that there was little or no systemic misbehaviour. But we won’t know without a proper public inquiry. The Government is refusing to call one. David Cameron and senior ministers appear to be in a kind of denial about the seriousness of the allegations. The Education Secretary, Michael Gove, yesterday repeated the party line on the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme that there shouldn’t be a public inquiry. So far the Government has agreed to ask the Home Office’s most senior official to look into the alarming, and unexplained, disappearance of 114 secret Home Office files on paedophile cases. It has also conceded a limited and brief investigation by an as yet unnamed senior lawyer into the disappearance of a dossier alleging high-level paedophile activity. This was handed in 1983 by the late Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens to the then Home Secretary, Leon Brittan. The loss of this dossier, which reportedly included the names of Savile, the Rochdale MP Sir Cyril Smith, and Margaret Thatcher’s former parliamentary private secretary Sir Peter Morrison — all of them now deceased — is too momentous an event to be dealt with by the kind of investigation envisaged by Mr Cameron. Moreover, only the executive summary of this report may be made public. Compare his reaction, and that of the Government, to the response to the actually incorrect allegation in July 2011 that the News of the World had deleted the voicemails of the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler nine years earlier, thereby giving her parents ‘false hope’ that she was still alive. Although there was already a police investigation underway into phone hacking, Mr Cameron lost no time in setting up a full judicial inquiry under Lord Justice Leveson into the ethics of the Press. Most people would probably say that alleged paedophile activity among senior politicians and officials, and the suggestion of a cover-up, are significantly more serious matters than phone hacking. Yet on this occasion Mr Cameron takes refuge in the argument that ‘we mustn’t do anything that could prejudice or prevent proper action by the police’. Quite so. But almost identical considerations didn’t stop him setting up the Leveson Inquiry. I’m almost certain that only inertia and poor advice are inhibiting the Prime Minister from doing the right thing. The danger, though, is that his critics will say he knows things about a cover-up which he would prefer were not made public. The refusal of the authorities to grip the issue is also illustrated by the very limited resources which the Metropolitan Police have devoted to Operation Fairbank, set up in November 2012 to investigate the historic allegations of child abuse relating to MPs. Only seven detectives have been engaged on this task, and, as the Mail reported on Saturday, sources close to Operation Fairbank say it has been under resourced. By contrast, some 30 officers have been attached to Operation Yewtree, which has successfully investigated sex abuse scandals involving deviant celebrities such as Jimmy Savile, Rolf Harris and Stuart Hall. In other words, more than four times as many officers have been engaged looking into the historic misdemeanours of celebrities, often going back 30 or even 40 years, as have been involved in investigating equally historic allegations against politicians. It comes after a Labour peer has been accused of 12 attacks. One source said the allegations were 'horrific'. Pictured is the Lords Chamber at the House of Lords where the peer sits . Meanwhile, 200 detectives have been deployed in investigating phone hacking and bribery allegations against journalists. Some will say that when it comes to looking into accusations in their own backyard, senior politicians are showing a good deal less enthusiasm than they did when presented with evidence of misconduct among a limited number of journalists. What could be more serious than the suspicion that ministers, MPs and officials were involved in paedophile activities, and that concerted attempts were made — possibly including the deliberate destruction of evidence — to hush up what had happened? And that makes it even more important, in the interests of Parliament and good governance, that there should be a full inquiry. For the rumours and stories circulating on the internet and Twitter could well exaggerate what really went on. Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who has done more than anyone to shed light on paedophile perversion at Westminster, most notably in the case of Cyril Smith, has claimed a senior Tory MP warned him that he was telephoned last weekend by Lady Brittan, wife of Leon Brittan, who was ‘worried’ Danczuk was going to ‘target’ her husband at a Home Affairs Select Committee meeting last Tuesday. In the event he didn’t, but the mention of Lady Brittan’s call, coupled with reports that Lord Brittan was recently questioned by police over claims that he raped a 19-year-old student in 1967, will only fuel further wild speculation and theorising. Yet it is perfectly possible that Lord Brittan is innocent of all and any wrong-doing, and that he fulfilled his duties admirably when handed that dossier by Geoffrey Dickens. We shouldn’t forget the case of Lord McAlpine. In late 2012, he was wrongly fingered as a paedophile by BBC2’s Newsnight, and convicted by Twitterdom, though he was absolutely innocent. Some of his friends believe the stress of these false allegations hastened his death earlier this year. Whether there was sex abuse and a cover-up among lawmakers on a huge scale, or whether such transgressions were far more limited, can be resolved only by the kind of public inquiry that David Cameron is stubbornly — and damagingly — resisting.","Lord Tebbit said there may have been political cover-up of sex abuse in 80s .

"North Korean scientists are now able to build crucial equipment for uranium-based nuclear bombs on their own, according to evidence gathered by two American experts. This cuts the need for imports, which had been one of the few ways outsiders could monitor the country's secretive atomic work. The experts say material published in North Korean scientific publications and news media shows that Pyongyang is mastering domestic production of essential components for the gas centrifuges needed to make such bombs. Pyongyang is mastering domestic production of essential components for the gas centrifuges needed to make such bombs: three file satellite images from 2012 show development of a building construction at Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center in North Korea . The development further complicates long-stalled efforts to stop a nuclear bomb programme that Pyongyang has vowed to expand, despite international condemnation. If Pyongyang can make crucial centrifuge parts at home, outsiders can't track sensitive imports. That could spell the end of policies based on export controls, sanctions and interdiction that have been the centerpiece of international efforts to stop North Korea's nuclear program over the last decade, Joshua Pollack, a Washington-based expert on nuclear proliferation, said. The remarks by Mr Pollack were prepared for delivery Wednesday at a Seoul symposium. Satellite image shows the area around the Yongbyon nuclear facility in Yongbyon, North Korea in 2012. The GeoEye image shows progress in construction of the containment building for the light-water reactor at the Yongbyon facility, according to the institute. North Korean scientists can produce components for the gas centrifuges needed to build uranium-based nuclear bombs . 'If they're not importing these goods in the first place, then we can't catch them in the act,' he said. Pollack gathered the evidence with Scott Kemp, an expert on centrifuge technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 'We won't necessarily see anything more than what the North Koreans want us to see,' he added. The state of North Korea's nuclear program is of vital concern to Washington, because Pyongyang wants to build an arsenal of nuclear-armed missiles that can reach American shores. The North has conducted three nuclear tests of apparently increasing power since 2006, most recently in February, and it is believed to have a handful of crude plutonium-based bombs. Pyongyang is the capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the largest city in the country . Many experts estimate, however, that Pyongyang has not yet mastered the miniaturisation technology needed to mount a warhead on a long-range missile. Fuel for North Korea's plutonium bombs has been made in a reactor that is large and easily monitored. But uranium-based weapons are more difficult for outsiders to investigate because the centrifuges needed to enrich uranium for bombs can be easily hidden away from satellites and prying inspectors. North Korean soldiers march during a military parade marking the 65th anniversary of the country's founding in Pyongyang, North Korea . The United States and others long suspected North Korea was clandestinely building a uranium program, despite denials from Pyongyang. U.S. officials confronted North Korea in 2002 with claims its scientists were pursuing uranium enrichment, sparking a nuclear crisis. In a reversal, visiting Americans were shown in November 2010 what they called a sophisticated, modern uranium enrichment facility with 2,000 centrifuges at the North's main nuclear facility. International sanctions barring nuclear weapons related shipments to North Korea did not stop its progress even when it relied on imported equipment. But the U.S. had some success tracking the parts allegedly used in the program. In 2007, then-U.S. nuclear envoy Christopher Hill said Washington had evidence that Pyongyang had bought equipment used only for uranium enrichment. The Yongbyon nuclear complex in Yongbyon back in 2010 - heavy construction and excavation equipment at the site and the construction of two small buildings . News media reports and unclassified government documents showed North Korea imported large amounts of centrifuge parts in the early 2000s, Pollack said. But an apparent dearth of observed imports since the early 2000s suggests that Pyongyang is making the necessary components at home. He said the know-how for domestic production of key parts appears to have been in place no later than 2009. Pollack said he and Kemp found 'strong and clear' evidence in state media photographs taken inside North Korean factories of specialised lathes that produce very strong metal cylinders needed for centrifuges. Supreme Leader of North Korea: Kim Jong-un speaking during a plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea in Pyongyang . He also spoke of accounts in North Korean propaganda and technical journals of iron and steel-making consistent with the production of an extremely hard steel alloy that can resist high rotational speeds in centrifuges, although the final step of the process wasn't described. Pollack said their research also found scientific reports and patent awards describing work on technologies for crucial centrifuge parts. Those include vacuum pumps that remove air from centrifuges and pipes before uranium-bearing gas is added and electronic devices that control the speed of the electric motor in the base of each centrifuge. North Korea's nuclear program is cloaked in secrecy and treated domestically as a national treasure. The small, impoverished country says it must defend itself from U.S. machinations to overthrow its political system. It's not clear whether North Korea has made bomb-grade uranium, and Pyongyang says the program is for peaceful, energy-generating purposes. But analysts strongly suspect that, even beyond the facility Americans toured in 2010, Pyongyang has other uranium enrichment facilities that could be producing large amounts of weapons-grade material. Earlier this year, during a barrage of threats aimed at Washington and Seoul, Pyongyang vowed to resume all its nuclear fuel production. Recent satellite imagery appears to show that North Korea was restarting its plutonium reactor.","Pyongyang is mastering domestic production of essential components for the gas centrifuges needed to make such bombs .

"The head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned that Ebola could become a global health catastrophe to rival AIDS. Dr Tom Frieden said: 'In the 30 years I've been working public health, the only thing like this has been AIDS, and we have to work now so that this is not the world's next AIDS.' Since the Ebola outbreak last December, some 3,865 people had died from the disease in West Africa, according to WHO figures until October 5. Scroll down for video .

Volunteers in protective suits carry for burial the body of a person who died from Ebola in Waterloo, Liberia on Tuesday.  The presidents of Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia pleaded today for international aid in battling the disease . Fr Frieden added: 'Speed is the most important variable here. This is controllable and this was preventable. It's preventable by investing in core public health services, both in the epicenter of the most affected countries, in the surrounding countries, and in other countries that might be affected.' His grave remarks came at the World Bank meeting in D.C. as the president of Sierra Leone today called on the world to send millions of dollars, hundreds of doctors and thousands of nurses to his nation to help fight what he calls 'a tragedy unforeseen in modern times . 'Our people are dying,' President Ernst Bai Koroma said today as he spoke via video conference at a World Bank meeting on the Ebola epidemic in Washington D.C. He described devastating effects of 'this evil virus' - saying children are being orphaned, doctors and nurses are dying, and Sierra Leone's health care system is overwhelmed. Koroma said the world's response has been slower than the spread of the disease, and its spread will threaten people everywhere. The presidents of Guinea and Liberia also made pleas for more aid to fight the virus that has killed more than 3,800 people in West Africa. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon called for a 20-fold surge in international aid to fight Ebola. 'For those who have yet to pledge, I say please do so soon,' he said. 'This is an unforgiving disease.' At the meeting here, President Alpha Conde of Guinea made an urgent plea for money, supplies, medicine, equipment and training of health care workers. Women faint as another reacts while volunteers (unseen) take away from a nearby house the body of a woman who died of Ebola, in Waterloo, Liberia. The CDC president said today that the world was facing a tragedy on the scale of the AIDS virus . 'Our countries are in a very fragile situation,' Conde said through a translator. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia also appeared by videoconference to seek a rapid increase in aid. World Bank President Jim Yong Kim endorsed pledges on Thursday from the United States and United Nations to guarantee medical evacuations for health care workers responding to the crisis, an effort to ensure that enough doctors and nurses are willing to risk their lives to help stop the disease. No details were given at the meeting. Kim also said that more hospitals and local health centers must be built quickly to ensure that West Africans have faith that they can get the care they need in their own community, and no longer fear that Ebola centers are places that people go to in order to die. Kim, a doctor who formerly led the World Health Organization's global AIDS treatment program, said studies of past disease outbreaks, such as the SARS virus, show that 80 percent to 90 percent of the economic impact comes from 'the fear factor that surrounds the outbreak.' The most urgent humanitarian need -getting medical care to treat people in their own communities - is also the best way to stop the spread of Ebola into other nations and counter the fear that magnifies its economic damage, Kim said. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Thomas Frieden joins finance ministers and representatives from around the world for a meeting on the Ebola crisis during the International Monetary Fund-World Bank Group annual meetings on Thursday . 'Trying to block your borders or isolate those countries in some way is not going to work,' he cautioned other nations. A World Bank report this week estimated that the economic toll of the largest Ebola outbreak in history could reach $32.6 billion if the disease continues to spread in West Africa through next year. 'Every dollar spent now may well be worth more than $20 or $30 spent in two months' time,' said David Nabarro, the United Nations special envoy on Ebola. 'This is a moment when there must be no postponement of financing decisions, no postponement of action.'","Speaking at the World Bank conference, CDC director Dr Tom Frieden said: 'We have to work now so that this is not the world's next AIDS'

"Five students at Seattle high school  between the ages of 14 and 15 are accused of sodomizing an 18-year-old special education student with a broomstick in October. The students, all football players at Juanita High School, were charged on Friday with second-degree rape. They will be arraigned in juvenile court on February 20. The Seattle Times reports that the special education student was allegedly lured into the shower of the locker room on October 22.. Alleged rape: Five students at Juanita High School in Seattle all between the ages of 14 and 15 are accused of sodomizing an 18-year-old special education student with a broomstick in October . It was there that three of the boys are accused of holding him down and pulling down his pants and underwear while one student attempted to sodomize the boy with a broomstick. One of the players recorded the incident on his cell phone. Kirkland police were called to the high school on December 22  when the victim's aunt claimed her nephew was sexually assaulted with a broomstick, according to court documents. Police say one of suspects soon said, 'this isn't funny anymore' and the teens halted their attack, reports Komo. The victim claims he was contacted that night by head football coach Shaun Tarantola, who said he was 'sorry that happened.' The victim was a volunteer football team manager, and the boys were football players, reports Fox. Students who witnessed the attack reported the incident to the Kirkland Police Department. 'Although the incident does not appear to have been sexually motivated, the charges reflect that the attack involved an attempted or threatened penetration with a broom handle while one student was restrained by several others,' the King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office said in a news release. Football players: All of the alleged attackers were football players at the school who allegedly targeted the victim in the locker room . All five of the students were expelled from school and because they were tried in a juvenile court, their names will not be revealed. Detectives interviewed the five suspects and all but one of them tried to place the blame on another student. Only one player admitted to the alleged rape and said 'I was going to stick a broom up (the victim's) a**,' according to court documents. In addition to the students' expulsion two of the Juanita football coaches were put on administrative leave in November while the assault was being investigated. They were able to return to their jobs in January. Principal Gary Moed wrote an email to students' parents following the incident saying that locker rooms would be supervised and locked if an adult is not able to be present. 'Five students have been charged with a very serious crime,' Moed wrote. 'The possibility that an incident of this nature could occur at Juanita High School has been devastating to this school and our community. This incident is not reflective of what we all know that Juanita High School represents. Our school has worked hard to make every student feel welcome and safe.'","The students, all football players at Juanita High School, were charged on Friday with second-degree rape .

"Families have been warned to not to approach an escaped giant owl - that’s so big it can eat cats and dogs. Zeus, the Eurasian Eagle-Owl, flew away from an aviary on Monday and has so far eluded capture. The 15-month-old bird is fully grown, boasting a 5ft wingspan and powerful enough to scoop up foxes and even small deer. Lee Hayman, of Exeter, Devon, with Zeus the Eurasian Eagle-Owl before the owl took off - there have been several sightings, but each time he's escaped . Falconer Lee Hayman, of Exeter, Devon, and his wife Claire have had Zeus for a year and say he’s a gentle giant with people he knows. But they warned families to keep clear of the massive bird in case it gets spooked and attacks them. Claire, 24, said: 'Zeus is about 15 months old and as such is fully grown. He is extremely powerful so obviously people must not approach him. 'He may be spooked and will fly to another destination, or he may attack. It is very important that they do not try to feed the bird, just ignore it and act as if it’s not there. Falconer Lee pictured with the giant owl. He says: 'I can cuddle him and kiss him on the head, but I wouldn't recommend anyone else trying that' 'It is ringed and has anklets on and we do not think it will have flown too far away, perhaps within a couple of miles’ radius of us. It is likely to be in someone’s garden.' Eagle owls grow to three times the size of barn owls. They are capable of killing foxes, marmots and small deer but they mainly hunt rats, rodents and hedgehogs - skinning them before eating them. Lee, 29, has already investigated several sightings but each time Zeus had flown off before he could get there. Impressive: Zeus the Eurasian Eagle-Owl has grown to three times the size of barn owls and has a 5ft wing-span . Lee said: 'He’s without doubt one of the most powerful birds in the world. But he’s not a killing machine, he’s a gentle giant. 'I can cuddle him and kiss him on the head but I wouldn’t recommend anyone else trying that.

Hunter-Reay became the first American since 2006 to win the Indianapolis 500, passing Castroneves at the Yard of Bricks as the two bright yellow cars raced wheel-to-wheel under the white flag in a thrilling final lap. As Hunter-Reay surged ahead down the backstretch, Castroneves took one final look coming out of Turn 4 but couldn't pull off the pass. Hunter-Reay was congratulated on the win by his two biggest fans - wife Beccy Gordon and their young son Ryden.

Her . mother, Marlene Gordon, pre-ran the Baja 500 when she was seven months . pregnant with Gordon, and her sister Robyn Gordon is the only female to . have ever won the Baja 1000 overall. Hunter-Reay won by 0.060 seconds - the . second closest finish in race history since Al Unser Jr. beat Scott . Goodyear by 0.043 seconds in 1992. 'I'm a proud American boy, that's for sure,' Hunter-Reay said in Victory Lane. 'I've watched this race since I was sitting in diapers on the floor in front of the TV.

Like father like son: Ryan Hunter-Reay holds his young son Ryden, who is wearing an identical firesuit to his dad, aloft after his win . Castroneves, trying to become the fourth driver to win a record fourth Indianapolis 500, settled for second. He was devastated by the defeat and needed several moments to compose himself, slumped in his car, head down and helmet on, before he was ready to speak.  The Brazilian said a caution with 10 laps to go that caused a red flag so track workers could clean up debris and make repairs to the track wall broke his rhythm. 'It was a great fight,' he smiled. 'I tell you what, I was having a great time. Unfortunately second. It's good, but second sucks, you know what I mean?' Marco Andretti finished third and Carlos Munoz was fourth as Andretti Autosport had three cars in the top four, as well as the winner.

"Miracle:  Dave Watson, from Walton-le-Dale, Lancashire, is a triple amputee but managed to pass his driving test first time . A war hero who lost both legs and his right arm in a bomb blast is celebrating after passing his driving test at the first attempt. Triple amputee Dave Watson, 26, was moments from death when he stepped on an improvised explosive device on foot patrol. But this week the former Guardsman tore up his 'L' plates after passing his test at the first time of asking - with just three 'minors'. Mr Watson, of Walton-le-Dale, Lancashire, had 38 lessons in a three month period in his specially modified Range Rover Sport and has now got a full driving licence. He said: 'I can go wherever I want. It means I will be more independent.' The specially modified car has a special box on the driver's door where Mr Watson puts his right arm. He pushes forward to brake and pulls backwards to accelerate. And there is small handle on the steering wheel for him to hold on to for steering, which also has buttons indicators, wipers and lights. Currently waiting for another operation on his prosthetic, Mr Watson has to have someone with him while he is driving but will be able to go out on his own after the surgery. Mr Watson said he picked up the skill quite quickly. 'I am one of those people, I'm no good at sitting there and reading but I can do the practical stuff,' he said. 'I went out when I got back from the test after sorting the insurance out and drove to my grandma's, took my brother to his mate's then I went to my mate's house to see him before he leaves for Australia.' The next step for Dave is to have some more motorway lessons.

"Roy Hodgson warned on Thursday he will ditch England players who say they are too tired to train as the fall-out continued from last month’s Raheem Sterling rumpus. Sterling was axed from the Euro 2016 qualifying win in Estonia after complaining of fatigue. And in a clear message ahead of the Slovenia clash at home on November 15 and the friendly against Scotland three days later, Hodgson said he would not tolerate any similar episodes. England’s head coach, who called West Brom striker Saido Berahino into the senior squad for the first time on Thursday, also criticised the FA for allowing an American football match to be played at Wembley on Sunday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Hodgson discuss Raheem Sterling . Roy Hodgson has warned he will ditch players who are too tired to train . Liverpool star Raheem Sterling was rested by Hodgson after he complained of tiredness . Hodgson, who is no longer on speaking terms with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers over the Sterling situation, said: ‘If a player came up to me one day before the game, when I was intending to play him, just before the session started, and said to me: “I don’t think I can train today because I’m feeling too tired”, then I would definitely leave him out.’ Rodgers disputed Hodgson’s version of events after Sterling was left out of the starting XI for the 1-0 win over Estonia and replaced by Adam Lallana. Hodgson added: ‘Unfortunately I have 30 witnesses and Brendan was not there. If that’s all it is, he got the wrong end of the stick and I would be happy to put him right and I would be happy to talk to him about it. He was not there. Brendan Rodgers is no longer on speaking terms with Hodgson after the Sterling saga . Saido Berahino's impressive start to the season has earned him a call-up to the England suad . ‘He (Sterling) came just before we started training. I never said Raheem said he was too tired to play. He did play and got us the free-kick which won the game. I said he said he was too tired before training and as a result I left him out of the team.’ Hodgson was in a cranky mood at times on Thursday and the state of the Wembley pitch was among his bugbears. The FA have hired out the stadium for another American football match, this time between Dallas Cowboys and Jacksonville Jaguars, just six days before England play Slovenia. The 67-year-old said: ‘I am a football coach, a football manager, not American football. I don’t really think you could expect me to say, “Excellent, delighted, well done”. But I’m realistic, I’m pragmatic and this match has been organised for a period of time now. ‘The pitch, unfortunately, is not in the best of nick anyway, which we’re all a bit unhappy with. I am not exactly jumping for joy. But at this particular moment I would honestly have to say if asked if it was a good thing or not, I would have to say not. ‘I can do nothing about it and we won’t use it as an excuse. We will get on with it. Hopefully in the future the pitch will recover to its normal level and when it has done that we will be better able to support this type of activity.’ Although Hodgson put pressure on Club England managing director Adrian Bevington to find a solution, the FA have already agreed to stage a series of American football games next year. Miami Dolphins and New York Jets face each other on October 4, five days before the return Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia. Hodgson was more upbeat about Berahino, who has been fast-tracked into the senior side after impressing in Gareth Southgate’s England Under 21 team. The striker’s rise has been extraordinary. He arrived in England from Burundi aged 10 to join his mum and sisters after his father was killed in the civil war.When he scored against Finland for England’s Under 21 team, he lifted his shirt to reveal the words: ‘RIP, love u dad’. Berahino has been promoted from Gareth Southgate's Under 21 side . Berahino paid tribute to his father after scoring against Finland last year . Hodgson said: ‘I know him quite well because I brought him into the first-team squad at West Brom. Dan Ashworth (head of elite development at the FA) has been a very important person in his life. ‘What he has is pace, a desire to run beyond defenders and composure when he finds himself one on one with the goalkeeper.’ Hodgson also revealed that right back Glen Johnson has slipped behind Nathaniel Clyne and Calum Chambers in the pecking order. ‘I haven’t spoken to Glen and I don’t always speak to players that I don’t select in the squad,’ Hodgson added. ‘I know he has not been at his best and he would be the first to admit that.’","Three Lions boss will leave out players who are too tired to train .

"The organs of a British man who died in Bermuda were removed without the consent or knowledge of his family - and have never been found, an inquest heard today. Construction worker Norman Palmer, 57, died in a hospital on the island, where he moved 30 years ago with his wife Kathleen, after suffering respiratory problems. When his body was flown back to the UK and his home town of Yeovil in Somerset a week later, it emerged many of his organs - including his brain, kidney and throat - were missing. Norman Palmer pictured with his wife Kathleen: When his body was returned from Bermuda to the UK in 2008 Kathleen was told many of his organs were missing . An inquest held in Wells in Somerset heard Mr Palmer was not an organ donor and his family were not informed before or after the 'mutilation'. The organs have never been traced and no explanation given, though a pathologist in Bermuda later offered to return Mr Palmer’s throat to British authorities, the hearing was told. Mr Palmer died at Bermuda’s King Edward VII Memorial Hospital on April 12 2008 following a long-standing respiratory problem, caused by a combination of asthma and an old shotgun wound. His wife Kathleen Palmer told East Somerset Coroner’s Court her husband had been denied his final wish of a cremation thanks to the removal of his organs, which meant there was a potential need for further post-mortem examinations. The King Edward VII hospital, Bermuda, where Mr Palmer died - an ambulance was 'delayed' picking him up because the driver decided to reverse into his driveway, an inquest was told . Mrs Palmer told the hearing: 'I still cannot come to terms with the fact that Norman is lying in a grave in the UK. 'I cannot bring myself to think of what the pathologist did to Norman and how she brutally mutilated his body. It is beyond my comprehension. 'We didn’t bury a human being, we only buried a shell of the person who was my companion and soul mate. 'Someone needs to be held responsible for this despicable act. He need never have died. 'I cry myself to sleep every night. I can never come to terms with the fact that Norman need not have died and what happened to his body after his death.' Paradise: Norman Palmer, 57, moved to Bermuda for a new life 30 years ago with his wife Kathleen . The inquest heard that when Mr Palmer was 16 he suffered a shotgun wound when the weapon he was carrying accidentally discharged. He received lifesaving treatment but later developed fibrosis on the soft tissue, which led to the narrowing to his airway over the years. The long-term smoker, who suffered from asthma, began complaining of flu-like symptoms in 2007 and was treated by his GP of 20 years, Dr Marion Hoefert. 'They mutilated my brother. It is like a horror story. 'Where are his body parts? What did they do with them? What were they used for? Why didn’t they put them back? - Heather Carberry, sister of Mr Palmer . On April 6 2008, he was admitted to hospital and was diagnosed as having an obstruction of his airway by Dr Ashfaq Syed. Dr Ashfaq Syed advised Mr Palmer to see on-call specialist Dr Wesley Millar, but Mr Palmer refused, as he wanted to see his own consultant, the inquest heard. Mrs Palmer said: 'We were never advised as to the seriousness of Norman’s condition, nor the consequences his decision would have.' Three days later, on April 9, Mr Palmer visited his GP, who insisted his breathing difficulties were 'asthma-related' and prescribed more inhalers for treatment. Mr Palmer followed Dr Hoefert’s advice and planned to attend a scan she booked on April 14. But on April 12, Mr Palmer began experiencing extreme breathing difficulties while at home with his wife. He decided to take a shower, hoping it would help, but he rapidly deteriorated 'in a matter of minutes' and Mrs Palmer dialled 911 at 4.45pm. The court was told the ambulance was delayed in reaching the Palmers' home - just a two minute drive from the hospital - as the driver decided to reverse into the lane. 'There was no sense of urgency,' Mrs Palmer said. 'I was watching my husband slowly suffocating.' Dr Ed Cooper, a pathologist at Yeovil District Hospital, pictured, noted Mr Palmer's kidney, spleen, brain, throat, thyroid, prostate, bladder, small and large intestine had been removed . Mr Palmer arrived at the hospital at 5.07pm and 'in severe respiratory distress'. He went into cardiac arrest and died at 5.25pm. Mrs Palmer later returned to the hospital to visit her husband in the morgue but her request was refused. The family claimed medical staff were disrespectful, laughing in front of the family minutes after Norman’s death. Mr Norman, a long-term smoker, suffered from asthma. He began complaining of flu-like symptoms in 2007 . 'I told her (a member of mortuary staff) I didn’t like the idea of him being alone down there,' Mrs Palmer said. 'I was told ""I can assure you Mrs Palmer, he won’t be alone.""' A post-mortem examination in Bermuda found the cause of death was respiratory failure and Mr Palmer’s body was flown back to Britain on April 20 2008. But a second post-mortem examination carried out by a British pathologist found Mr Palmer had been repatriated with most of his organs missing. Dr Ed Cooper, a pathologist at Yeovil District Hospital, noted Mr Palmer’s kidney, spleen, brain, throat, thyroid, prostate, bladder, small and large intestine had been removed. He recorded the cause of death as respiratory failure caused by asthma related mucus plugging on the bronchi and laryngeal fibrosis. At an inquest in Bermuda, coroner Khamisi Tokunbo recorded that Mr Palmer died of natural causes, as a result of self-neglect. Mr Palmer’s family contested the finding and appealed to the country’s Supreme Court, who upheld it. But East Somerset Coroner Tony Williams questioned the original finding as he recorded a narrative conclusion. 'Self-neglect should only be recorded when there is a gross failure to obtain basic medical attention,' he said. 'Mr Palmer was taking medical advice and following the advice of his doctor.' East Somerset Coroner's Court, pictured. A coroner recorded a narrative conclusion, confirming he died of respiratory failure caused by asthma related mucus plugging his lungs combined with a build of scar tissue from an old gun shot injury . Mr Williams said he was unable to include the details of Mr Palmer’s missing organs in his formal conclusion. But he added: 'I am satisfied that these body parts would have been removed in Bermuda because of the lack of the Human Tissue Act. 'That meant the family were not advised of the removal and it only came to light as a result of further examination in this country. 'I have to say it is not uncommon for bodies to be returned to this country with body parts missing.' Speaking after the inquest, Mr Palmer’s family said the inquest in Britain was a positive step but 'doesn’t finish the story'. Heather Carberry, sister of Mr Palmer, said: 'None of us have any idea what happened to my brother’s organs. We still don’t know what happened. 'All of his organs apart from one kidney are missing. They mutilated my brother. It is like a horror story. 'Where are his body parts? What did they do with them? What were they used for? Why didn’t they put them back? 'I believe that if this had happened in the UK it wouldn’t have come to my brother even needing to call an ambulance. He would still be alive.' The East Somerset coroner recorded a narrative conclusion, confirming he died of respiratory failure caused by asthma related mucus plugging his lungs combined with a build of scar tissue from his old gun shot injury.","His kidney, spleen, brain, throat, thyroid, prostate, bladder, small and large intestine had been removed .

"Once described as the 'grandest house in Scotland', Britain's most expensive repo home is being sold for a knockdown price of £1.6 million. Melville House with its 11 main bedrooms, seven reception rooms and stunning architectural features has become one of the greatest bargains on the housing market. The pile, set in 16 acres at Monimail, near Cupar, Fife, Scotland, is the former home of the politician who helped Prince William of Orange take the throne. It was on the market for £4.5 million, but now just £1.6 million is being asked for it. Melville House: It was once valued at £4.5m, but failed to find a buyer and became Britain's most expensive repossession in 2005 . One of seven reception rooms at Melville House, Fife, Scotland which is on the market at a knockdown price of £1.6 million . It was built in 1697 using the wealth accrued by Protestant sympathiser George Meville, who became Secretary of State for Scotland through his loyalty to the king in the 17th century Glorious Revolution. He was later given an earldom. It was built by the Surveyor of Royal Works James Smith, who also helped build the Palace of Holyroodhouse and Drumlanrigg Castle. But the pile, endured a chequered history over the centuries. It was once valued at £4.5m but failed to find a buyer and became Britain's most expensive repossession in 2005. The current owners bought the property in 2009 after it was repossessed by a South African bank from its previous residents.

The cricket lawn and tennis court are also being upgraded and, adds a Knight Frank spokesman: 'The most enchanting treehouse has been built to keep lookout over the front drive.' The chequered history of the building started with the first owner: George Melville only lived in the house before he died and the estate was passed on to his family who owned it until 1949 when it was sold. It was turned into a private school for children with special needs for almost 50 years, although the Army used it as a hospital and temporary barracks during World War II.

"Nobody spoke English like Sir Donald Sinden. The actor, who has died aged 90, was the last and greatest of a generation that sounded every consonant of every word. This theatrical knight confessed that three things made his blood boil: vandalism, litter and the misuse of the English language. It gets me so cross,’ he would say, ‘the way the ends of words are never pronounced, like “yeah” instead of “yes”.’ Donald Sinden, who played Chief Officer Shawe-Wilson in The Captain's Table, died on Thursday aged 90 . He won fame as a leading man in the golden age of British cinema, as a light comedian, as a Shakespearian orator, in TV sitcom and as a West End star . His resonant tones made him a booming success in every branch of acting. He won fame as a leading man in the golden age of British cinema, as a light comedian, as a Shakespearian orator, in TV sitcom and as a West End star. That fruity — many would say hammy — voice was unmistakable. As Malvolio in Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night, he delivered the classic line ‘Some have greatness thrust upon ’em,’ exaggerating every syllable — ‘Sommme! Have Grrreat-Nesss! Therrrustt! Upp On ’Emmm!’ But he lacked the obsessive drive of contemporaries such as Laurence Olivier or Dickie Attenborough — rather than making epics or winning Oscars, Sinden preferred to potter around English churches, taking notes on their architecture, or to explore Italy by car with his beloved wife, Diana. Born in 1923, the son of a chemist in Ditchling, in Sussex, he suffered from asthma throughout his childhood, and left school at 15 to be apprenticed to a shopfitter. With his wheezy voice, acting had never occurred to him, but at the outbreak of war his cousin, an amateur actor, was called up and Donald became his stand-in for an am-dram production in Brighton. To his surprise, he was a natural. He was talent-spotted by the director of a wartime entertainment unit, and spent the rest of the war learning joinery in the workshop each day and touring Army training camps and anti-aircraft batteries each evening. ‘I was either brilliant, or they couldn’t find anyone else,’ he joked. When his own call-up papers came, he was ruled medically unfit for duty owing to his asthma. So he entertained the troops — in 1945, he toured Europe and India with ENSA, the Entertainments National Service Association (also known as Every Night Something Awful). Then he trained at the Webber Douglas drama school in London, where voice coaches helped him develop his thundering bass delivery, with syllables that sounded like lumps of falling masonry. He met Diana Mahony after earning a place at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon as an understudy. Diana was playing Helen of Troy in Dr Faustus, and Ceres in The Tempest. ‘She had a line in goddesses that season,’ Sinden said. ‘She was a classical-looking lady, statuesque and beautiful.’ Sir Donald Sinden, pictured outside Buckingham Palace after receiving his knighthood, had prostate cancer . Sinden (right) played Simon Peel, a snooty antiques dealer, in sitution comedy Never the Twain . The first time he proposed, by moonlight on a bridge over the Avon, she declined. But he persevered, and they married in 1948. Diana gave up her career to raise their family: they had two children, Jeremy and Marc, both actors. The devoted couple were together for more than 55 years until Diana’s death from cancer, aged 77, in 2004. While she had been caring for their babies, Donald tirelessly made his name as an actor. In a 19-month run during the late Forties at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in The Heiress, he never missed a show. The management gave him an engraved silver ashtray to mark his achievement of giving more consecutive performances than any other actor in the theatre’s history. The ashtray was appropriate — despite his asthma, Sinden would for much of his life puff through two or more packs a day. His cinema breakthrough came in 1953 with an adaptation of The Cruel Sea, Nicholas Monsarrat’s novel about the battle between the Navy and German U-boats hunting Atlantic convoys during World War II. Jack Hawkins, then the country’s biggest star, was the commander of a sub-hunter, and newcomer Sinden was his brave but inexperienced junior, in a father-son relationship that many film buffs believe would have earned them Oscars for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, had the movie been made in Hollywood. The honours went to On The Waterfront with Marlon Brando, the mumbling, slurring antithesis of everything Sinden stood for. His loathing of ‘Method’ acting won Sinden an unexpected admirer, Marilyn Monroe. Their dressing rooms at Pinewood studios were four doors apart while she was filming The Prince And the Showgirl, and he another movie, and Sinden mocked her attempts at Brando-style naturalism. He hung a sign on his door advertising his own drama classes, guaranteed to out-do the Method: ‘You too can be inaudible! “Ums” and “Ers” rendered obsolete!’ Monroe saw the joke and started dropping in, not for acting lessons but to offload her troubles. ‘She popped in for a natter and a giggle,’ Sinden said. ‘Of course as a sex symbol she was stunning, but sadly, she must be one of the silliest women I have ever met.’ Accolades were heaped on him for Twelfth Night and Much Ado About Nothing, in which he acted with Judi Dench, and for his King Lear . The Cruel Sea was followed by another war classic, Above Us The Waves, as well as lighter films, like The Captain’s Table, You Know What Sailors Are and the romantic farce Doctor In The House. Sinden played Tony Benskin, the eternal medical student who spends his time boozing and chasing nurses. When he saw a girl he liked, Benskin, instead of wolf-whistling, would emit a gutteral growl. This sexy-but-safe persona won him stardom, and he was voted the face British housewives would most like to see across their breakfast tables. But it also prevented him from being taken seriously. When a sex scandal forced Britain’s highest-paid TV star Leslie Phillips out of his hit ITV sitcom, Our Man At St Mark’s in 1963, the lovable but harmless Sinden was the obvious choice to take over. He became so disillusioned at the way film producers refused to cast him in serious roles that he quit his contact with Rank studios and returned to Stratford. Under director Peter Hall he played the Duke of York in The Wars Of The Roses, an adaptation of Shakespeare’s Henry VI trilogy, and took the play to the West End. It was a triumph. He followed that with a Restoration comedy, The Relapse, as the ludicrously camp Lord Foppington, with rosebud lips and an orange head-dress based on wigs worn by female impersonator Danny La Rue. Sir Donald Sinden died at his home in Romney Marsh, Kent, 10 years after his wife passed away . Accolades were heaped on him for Twelfth Night and Much Ado About Nothing, in which he acted with Judi Dench, and for his King Lear. In 1979 he became the last white actor to play Othello at Stratford with his face blackened. It’s a performance I was lucky enough to see: he was heartfelt and tragic as the African general who kills his wife in a jealous rage. But the black-and-white minstrel’s make-up, contrasted with the plummy vowels, seemed too dated to be taken seriously. Though not yet 60, Sinden sensed that his era in the theatre was passing. He fell back on television, as Elaine Stritch’s butler in Two’s Company and as an antiques dealer in Never The Twain, which ran for ten years. It became a family affair: sons Jeremy and Marc played police officers in one episode, while Diana was in the final show. His passion for religious architecture led him to present a BBC documentary series in 1988, The English Country Church, in which his delivery was so orotund and opulent that he earned his own puppet on Spitting Image. His character was usually seen pleading for a knighthood (the real one arrived in 1997). And at a restaurant, the Sinden puppet summoned a waiter and boomed: ‘Do you serve a ham salad?’ Yes, came the reply — they served salad to anyone. He and Diana were devastated by the death of Jeremy, aged 45, from cancer in 1996. Donald continued to work in television, but his great pleasure in later life was to regale friends at the Garrick Club with theatrical anecdotes — and the printable ones were collected into an Everyman book. His voice came to be known as the defining sound of the Garrick. It was the sound of a vanished age of English theatre, too. No actor will ever again declaim his lines with such majesty as Donald Sinden.","Sir Donald Sinden died  on Thursday after a battle with prostate cancer .

"England's preparations for next month's autumn series continue to be disrupted by injury with Billy Vunipola joining Luther Burrell in the treatment room. Vunipola was concussed in Saracens' Champions Cup defeat by Munster on Friday and will follow return to play protocols in training over the next week. Twenty-fours hours later Burrell was withdrawn shortly after half-time of Northampton's victory over the Ospreys with an injury to his right hand. Luther Burrell trudges off the field during Northampton's victory over Ospreys after injuring his right hand . Billy Vunipola was concussed during Saracens European Rugby Champions Cup match with Munster . Burrell is to remain at Saints rather than join up with England's squad at Pennyhill Park with the extent of the damage expected to be known by midweek. James Haskell continues to be monitored for the virus that resulted in his hospitalisation 10 days ago, forcing him to miss Wasps' last two games. England head coach Stuart Lancaster has called up Exeter trio Dave Ewers, Henry Slade and Thomas Waldrom as cover. Ewers is picked ahead of Will Fraser of Saracens, who also has concussion.

Stuart Lancaster has called up Exeter trio Dave Ewers, Henry Slade and Thomas Waldrom as cover . 'Luther will be assessed by a specialist over the next 48 hours and our medics are in close contact with Saints so we'll know more in a few days, but it's great to be able to bring in Henry,' Lancaster said. 'Billy will undergo the return to play protocol with us and will resume training once he has completed that. 'Injuries are inevitable but we are excited about the group we have in camp.' Burrell is a long shot to start the QBE Series opener against New Zealand on November 8 - Kyle Eastmond and Brad Barritt are the likely centre pairing - but Vunipola has been inked in at number eight.

"The national security adviser, Susan Rice, said on Sunday she was not '100 percent correct' in her remarks after the deadly 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Libya, but called it patently false to say she intentionally misled Americans about the incident. On NBC's Meet the Press, Rice said that when she made statements about the attacks that killed four Americans, including that they were 'spontaneous,' she was simply sharing 'the best information she had' at the time. Rice was the ambassador to the United Nations at the time and the comments met with  backlash, with Republican lawmakers accusing the White House of downplaying the attacks ahead of the presidential election. No regrets: Susan Rice said on Meet the Press that she never meant to downplay the Benghazi attacks . Republican critics were not satisfied with her explanation, with Senator John McCain proclaiming himself 'almost speechless.' On September 11, 2012, an attack by militants at the U.S. mission in Benghazi killed American Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Just days later, Rice appeared on news shows and stated that the attack was the spontaneous work of a crowd angry about an insulting video that denigrated Islan, instead of a pre-planned attack by Islamic militants. When Rice's 2012 account proved incorrect, Republican lawmakers accused her of trying to protect Obama during his re-election campaign, which the White House disputed. 'I commented that this was based on what we knew on that morning [and] was provided to me and my colleagues - and indeed to Congress - by the intelligence community. And that's been well validated in many different ways since,' she said. Terror attacks: A vehicle and the surrounding area are engulfed in flames after it was set on fire inside the U.S. consulate compound in Benghazi late on September 11, 2012 . Former job: Susan Rice was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations at the time of the attacks . 'And that information turned out, in some respects, not to be 100 per cent correct. But the notion that somehow I or anybody else in the administration misled the American people is patently false.' Rice said she did not have any regrets about the 2012 comments. She also said the United States remains committed to catching the perpetrators of the attack. 'And we will stay on it until this gets done,' she added. Amid the fallout from her 2012 remarks, Rice withdrew her name from consideration later that year to be nominated as Obama's second-term secretary of state, and former Senator John Kerry got the job. Instead, Rice was appointed national security adviser, which does not require Senate confirmation. Appearing on the CBS program 'Face the Nation,' McCain said Rice in 2012 was reading from talking points that were 'absolutely false.' 'And of course, the information was totally misleading, totally false - and for Susan Rice to say such a thing, I think, it's a little embarrassing, to tell you the truth,' he added.","Former U.S. ambassador to the UN Susan Rice said today that information she shared after the 2012 Benghazi attacks wasn't '100 per cent correct'

"French-born Fabrice Anthamatten, 39, was convicted in both France and Switzerland on rape charges dating back as far as 2001 . A man-hunt is underway in Switzerland after the body of a Swiss therapist was found dead in the woods in Switzerland just hours after she had escorted a convict on a reintegration to society session. Adeline Morel, a 34-year-old mother and therapist, went missing with Fabrice Anthamatten, 39, yesterday. Her body was hidden in a bag in the woods in Versoix near the Swiss city. Anthamatten had been charged with rapes going back more than 10 years. French-born Anthamatten was serving out his sentence at Geneva’s Champ-Dollon prison - he was convicted in both France and Switzerland on rape charges dating back as far as 2001. Back then he was given a five-year sentence for rape and in 2003 he was given another 15 years. The pair failed to show up for an equestrian therapy session scheduled for yesterday morning. They were seen travelling in a white Citröen Berlingo with licence plates GE 719 149, according to local police. Police forces in Switzerland, France and Germany are combing the area around Geneva and Basel, using helicopters and policedogs, following a tip-off that Anthamatten may be hiding there. Anthamatten was permitted to leave the Geneva prison under Morel’s escort for the purposes of 'reintegrating' him into society, thelocal.com writes. A criminal investigation has been launched into the affair, while Anthamatten remains on the run. The case has raised questions about leniency towards convicts and how a convicted rapist could have been trusted to leave the prison with only a woman as an escort. Geneva, Switzerland: Adeline Morel's body was hidden in a bag in the woods in Versoix near the Swiss city . It also resembles another case in May this year, when convicted murderer Claude Dubois, 36, strangled a 19-year-old woman in Payerne in the Canton of Vaud, the French-speaking western part of Switzerland.

"Schoolboy Riley Pearson, six, has been suspended for four days for breaking school rules by having Mini Cheddars in his packed lunch . A six-year-old boy who went to school with a bag of Mini Cheddars in his packed lunch has been suspended for four days after teachers said it contravened its healthy eating policy. Riley Pearson, from Colnbrook, near Slough, was excluded from Colnbrook C of E Primary School after teachers discovered the snack and called in his parents. After a meeting with headmaster Jeremy Meek, they were sent a letter telling them Riley would be excluded from Wednesday until Monday because he had been 'continuously breaking school rules'. The school, which was placed in special measures after Ofsted inspectors deemed it 'inadequate' in 2012, introduced a healthy eating policy at the start of term. A letter was sent to parents saying that from 14 January, packed lunches should be 'healthy and balanced'. Parents were told: 'Chocolate, sweets, crisps and fizzy drinks are not allowed. 'If your child's lunchbox is unhealthy and unbalanced they will be provided with a school lunch for which you will be charged.' Today Riley's mother, airport shuttle worker Natalie Mardle, 24, said: 'We just do not see how they have the right to tell us what we can feed our son. 'If anything, Riley is underweight and could do with putting on a few pounds.' Miss Mardle, who is expecting her fourth child, added: 'Having a balanced diet also includes eating some carbohydrates, sugars and fats. 'It is not about excluding some foods, it is about getting the mix right.' Riley’s lunchbox usually contains a sandwich, yoghurt tube, Dairylea Dunkers cheese spread snack, and a packet of Mini Cheddars, with water to drink. His mother, who lives with his father, airport worker Tom Pearson, said the 3ft 9ins tall schoolboy who weighs 3st 2lbs, eats home-cooked meals and plenty of fruit and vegetables at home. Miss Mardle said: 'I would understand the exclusion if he was constantly throwing tables around or bullying other children, but it is just ridiculous for a packet of Mini Cheddars. 'Not balanced': Riley's lunchbox fell foul of the new health eating policy at Colnbrook C of E primary school . Letter to parents: Riley's parents were sent a letter outlining the reasons for his exclusion by the head, Mr Meek . 'Surely the headteacher has better things to do with his time than search lunchboxes?' Riley's parents, who both work at nearby Heathrow Airport, will be attending a meeting with the head on Tuesday to learn whether their son can return to the 290-pupil school. Headteacher Mr Meek said the school had one family who 'do not agree with the policy.' He said: 'We have had a wonderful response and the parents and children are on board and pleased with the way the policy has been impacted on our pupils. The boy was suspended from Colnbrook C of E Primary School, pictured, for bringing in the snack . 'We cannot talk about individual circumstances, but there is one family who are not prepared to support the policy. 'We are in discussions with them about how we move it forward. We have excluded [the pupil] for four days due to lack of support for the policy. 'It is to avoid putting the children in a difficult situation. If the policy is not being abided by, then that potentially harms that pupil.'","Riley Pearson was banned for four days after breaking school lunch policy .

Debris: A tarpaulin has been pulled over the house roof and charred furniture has been dragged outside as the owners survey the damage . No one was injured in the blaze, although the spider is believed to have perished. Attempts by fire crews to put out the blaze were delayed over fears that rounds of ammunition may be stored inside. Seattle fire department's spokesman Kyle Moore said the tenant had used 'a self-made blowtorch to kill a spider in the laundry room.' 'I don't want to encourage people to do . this, but that's what he did,' Moore said. 'The spider tried . to get into the wall. He sprayed flames on the wall, lit the wall on . fire, and that extended up to the ceiling.' Washington state is home to two venomous spiders - the black widow and the hobo spider. While deaths from both are rare, hobo spiders can cause skin ulcerations, headaches and disorientation. Fire damage: A large hole can be seen in the property's roof after a blaze broke out in the laundry room . Homeless: The Red Cross has found temporary accommodation for the tenants of the Seattle home . A black widow bite has been known to kill in a small percentage of cases. Mostly, its venom causes severe muscle spasms. It is not clear if the spider was a venomous one, but Moore said that fire was not the most effective way to get rid of creepy crawlies. Neighbors described seeing flames and black smoke pouring from the property as the fire took hold. 'There were giant clouds of smoke pouring out of the windows,' Kaitlin Sharp told Kiro TV. The Red Cross is providing temporary accommodation for the displaced family after the house was declared uninhabitable.

"A Turkish family that walks on all fours do not walk like primates and are not an example of 'reverse evolution', scientists today claimed. The five brothers and sisters, aged between 18 and 34 and from a village in Hatay Province, south Turkey, have fascinated scientists across the world since they were first discovered in 2005. They get around by 'bear crawling' on their feet and palms - and can only stand upright for a short time, with both knees and head flexed. Walking on all fours: This man and his four siblings, aged between 18 and 34 and from a small village in Hatay Province, south Turkey, have fascinated scientists across the world since they were first discovered in 2005 . Earlier theories claimed the Ulas family's quadrupedal gait was similar to the movement of primates, suggesting 'a backwards stage in human evolution'. But now, American scientists have concluded that the siblings' walk is an adaptation to an unforeseen and rare disorder. In a report published in PLOS One, the researchers said the family moves laterally - unlike primates, who walk in a diagonal sequence, repeatedly putting a hand on one side and a foot on the other. They claimed the siblings' walk is, in fact, a byproduct of a hereditary condition that causes cerebellar hypoplasia, complicating their sense of balance. Unusual walk: They brothers and sisters get around by 'bear crawling' on their feet and palms - and can only stand upright for a short time, with both knees and head flexed. Above, a female member of the family at home . Getting around: Earlier theories claimed the Ulas family's quadrupedal gait was similar to the movement of primates, suggesting 'a backwards stage in human evolution'. Above, members of the family walk on all fours . To adapt to this condition, the family have developed quadrupedalism, they said. 'I was determined to set the record straight, because these erroneous claims about . the nature and cause of the quadrupedalism  have . been published over and over again, without any actual analysis of the . biomechanics of their gait, and by researchers who are not experts in . primate locomotion,' lead researcher Liza Shapiro, of the University . of Texas, told The Washington Post. 'We have shown that the quadrupedalism . resembles that of healthy human adults asked to walk quadrupedally in an . experimental setting. [They do not] prefer the diagonal . sequence/diagonal couplets gait characteristic of nonhuman primates.' Movement: But now, U.S. scientists have claimed the family moves laterally - unlike primates, who walk diagonally. Above, a comparison of footfall sequence in primate (baboon, top) and nonprimate (cat, bottom) Byproduct: They said the walk is a byproduct of a hereditary condition that causes cerebellar hypoplasia . In 2005, British researchers agreed in a . separate study that the siblings' walk differs from that of some . primates, noting that they put all of their weight on their palms and . wrists not their knuckles. However, Turkish evolutionary biologist Uner Tan previously claimed that the siblings, who also appear to have brain damage, suffered from a condition called Uner Tan Syndrome. He declared that people affected by this syndrome walk with a quadrupedal locomotion and are afflicted with 'primitive' speech and severe mental retardation, suggesting 'reverse evolution'. 'The idea of reverse evolution was just a flash, an ""aha"" experience,' Mr Tan told NeuroQuantology. Differences: In 2005, British researchers agreed in a separate study that the siblings' walk differs from that of some primates, noting that they put all of their weight on their palms and wrists (pictured) not their knuckles . 'I . suddenly realized they were exhibiting the walking style of our ape-like . ancestors... I was the scientist who first suggested the existence of . reverse evolution in human beings.' The . siblings, whose parents walk normally, were first filmed in the 2006 . BBC2 documentary, The Family That Walks On All Fours, which explored the . science and story behind their plight. While two of the daughters and a son have only ever walked on two palms and two feet, another son and daughter sometimes manage to walk upright. Family: The siblings, whose parents walk normally, also appear to have brain damage . Professor Nicholas Humphrey, who visited the family twice during the documentary, said: 'It's amazing as an example of a . strange, strange aberration of human development. But their interest is . how they can live in the modern world.' He said he thought the family had reverted to an instinctive form of behaviour encoded deep in the brain but abandoned during evolution. 'I do not think they were destined to be quadrupeds by their genes, but their unique genetic make-up allowed them to be,' he said. 'It has produced an extraordinary window on our past. It is physically possible, which no one would have guessed from the modern human skeleton.' He added: 'However they arrived at this point, we have adult human beings walking like ancestors several million years ago.' The five siblings, who have 14 other brothers and sisters who are not affected by the condition, spend most of their time sitting outside the family's basic rural home. However, one brother travels to the local village where he engages in basic interactions with people. The latest research was carried out by Ms Shapiro, Whitney Cole, Scott Robinson and Karen Adolph, all of New York University, Jessica Young, of Northeast Ohio Medical University and David Raichlen, of the University of Arizona.","Five brothers and sisters, aged between 18 and 34, live in Hatay, Turkey .

Peru: The first advertising billboard in the world to make drinking water out of thin air . The university came up with the idea to transform the country's high levels of humidity into water in conjunction with ad agency Mayo DraftFCB, the website bigthink.com reported. Lima, the capital of Peru, is the second largest capital in the world that’s located in a desert and access to drinking water is a problem to its 7 million people. Over a million have no access to running water at all and rely on private companies to deliver to their homes. The city is part of a coastal desert of Atacama, the driest in the world. It depends on drainage from the Andes as well as runoff from glacier melt — both sources on the decline because of climate change.

"The pregnant teen daughter of a flight attendant found stabbed to death and taped at the limbs in the body of her trunk has been charged with murder. Alyssa Barrett, 17, faces counts of murder and burglary in her mother's death. She was charged only days after her 18-year-old boyfriend Damarius Wren was also charged with murder, according to WMAQ. He was arrested after Indiana police found a GPS system pinpointing where DeCarol Deloney-Cain's body was dumped. Scroll down for video . The accused: Alyssa Barrett, 17, and Damarius Wren, 18, are both charged in the murder of Barrett's mother . The 54-year-old flight attendant's body had to be identified through the serial number in her breast implants. When police searched the victim's home they found traces of blood, stains, and red duct tape similar to that used to bound the hands and feet of Deloney-Cain. Police were allegedly contacted by the victim's teenage daughter, who said she had found a bloody wrench in the basement bedroom of her home. A GPS system was also found in the home, which police reports said showed directions to where the woman's body had been left in Gary. When police questioned Wren he allegedly gave two differing accounts of how he found the body of his girlfriend's mother. The . victim's daughter, who has not been identified, later claimed that Wren . had attacked her mother when she returned home on July 3. Victim: The body of flight attendant Decarol Deloney-Cain was found bound, wrapped in bags and stuffed in the trunk of her car . She alleged that Wren put a pillowcase over Deloney-Cain's head and hit her head against the stairs, before stabbing her with a kitchen knife, according to court records seen by My Fox Memphis. A coroner said Deloney-Cain, who had three children, suffered multiple stab wounds and blunt force trauma to the head. The records state that the girl hid upstairs and later saw two of Wren's friends arrive and help carry the body to a car in plastic bags. She . claimed that she got in a car driven by one of the men and followed . behind the vehicle her mother's body was in, and watched as it was left . on a dirt road. The . court report states that she then withdrew cash from her mother's bank . account, while being threatened with a gun, out of fear of what Wren and . his friends may do to her. The daughter is not facing any charges. Dumped: Deloney-Cain's body was found in the trunk of her car on this desolate dirt road . Deloney-Cain, . who worked as a flight attendant for United Airlines, was not reported . missing until Monday when she failed to turn up for work. She often . worked on international flights and would be away for a couple of days . at a time. Deloney-Cain's brother, Todd, praised the police team behind the investigation. 'I do commend the Gary Police Department for coming up with charges as quick as they did,' he told NBC Chicago.

"Five Saudi men have been sentenced to 32 years in prison and 4,500 lashes by a criminal court in Saudi Arabia - for holding a Valentine's Day party. The law breaking men were caught at a rented rest house in the Al-Farouq area of Buraidah Qassim province and accused of holding a party with women who were unrelated to them, drinking and dancing. Police from the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice (CPVPV) rounded up the men with the help of security patrols for their offences along with six women on February 14. Banned: Saudi men were banned from using camera phones for a time over fears that men would use them to secretly photograph women and publish them on the Internet without the consent of the subjects . The men have all admitted to the charges, which include illicit seclusion with unrelated women, dancing and drinking. A judge will decide the fate of the six women. The Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice is the Saudi Arabian government's agency's religious police or mutaween (meaning pious) to enforce Sharia Law within the Islamic nation. Altogether, it has 3,500 to 4,000 police officers who enforce a strict religious code among citizens. Members patrol the streets checking dress code, strict separation of men and women, salat prayer by Muslims during prayer times, and other behavior it believes to be commanded by Islam. The mutaween (CPVPV) are known for having full beards and wearing their headscarves (ghutrah or shemagh) loose without an agal and often come from Saudi Arabia's lower classes. The body has widespread powers to detain and berate offenders and shut down businesses and are employed directly by the King. The organization's 2013 budget was the equivalent of US$390million. In a separate case, Raif Badawi, a Saudi blogger recently fell foul of the authorities and faces ten years in jail, a thousand lashes and a million riyal fine for 'insulting Islam'. Mr Badawi' was arrested in June 2012 and . charged with cyber crime and disobeying his father - a crime in Saudi . Arabia - in relation to his Saudi Liberal Network website.. The . site included articles that were critical of senior religious figures . such as Saudi Arabia's Grand Mufti, according to Human Rights Watch. He had originally faced seven years in jail and 600 lashes, but an appeal court overturned that sentence and ordered a retrial. Amnesty International called the new sentence 'outrageous' and said Badawi is a 'prisoner of conscience'. His website has been closed since his first trial. King Abdullah: The King employs a religious police to enforce behaviour that goes against strict Islamic rule and this has even hit bloggers like Raif Badawi, right, who faces ten years in jail for insulting Islam . Citizens of Saudi Arabia are constantly encouraged to inform on others who break the law. Punishment for many offenses is . severe, often involving beatings and humiliation and foreigners are not . excluded from arrest.

Human Rights Watch says Saudi Arabia, a staunch ally of the West in the Middle East, has a long history of suppressing free expression . Philip . Luther, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at . Amnesty International, urged Saudi authorities to quash blogger Badawi's . conviction.

"Shocking new video has emerged of the minutes after an asthmatic, obese man was put in a chokehold that may have killed him - and the cop responsible has had his gun and badge stripped. Eric Garner, 43, died shortly after he was thrown to the ground and choked-out by NYPD officers outside the Staten Island store in which he worked. This new footage shows him unresponsive on the ground for several minutes before help arrives. The video picks up where another disturbing video left off, with the man seemingly unconscious after the violent arrest. Scroll down for video . Unresponsive: Eric Garner appears unconscious and is barely breathing to the point an officer checks his pulse . Officers Daniel Pantaleo and Justin Damico have since been placed on desk duty, with eight-year veteran Pantaleo forced to hand in his gun and badge, according to the New York Daily News, which originally made the original video public. The second video shows Garner on his side on the ground as a crowd builds around him. Police first try to make the person capturing the footage leave, but they do not. Cops try to talk with Garner, but he does not respond - his eyes are closed and his head droops onto the sidewalk. They openly wonder if he still has a pulse, and one officer presses his fingers to Garner's neck and says he does. People keep asking why they aren't doing CPR, and paramedics do not arrive for over three minutes. The paramedic tries communicating with Garner: 'We're here to help.' But he does not answer. 'Here to help': garner is motionless, but a paramedic is able to confirm he still has a pulse . Remarkable: The officer who put Garner in the lethal chokehold waves just after his colleagues lift the obese, unconscious man onto a stretcher . The paramedic checks his pulse and says he's still alive, then decides he needs to go on a stretcher. Still not alert, Garner is rolled over and at least six cops, plus the paramedic, hoist him on to a stretcher. Another person asks again why no CPR was performed. 'Because he's still breathing,' and officer snaps at the person. Despite Garner's dire medical condition being apparent to the still-building crowd, many cops stand around casually talking with each other, some can even be heard laughing. The officer who put Garner in the chokehold amazingly waves to the camera as Garner is wheeled away. The damning footage came to light the same day his widow spoke publicly for the first time of her horror at seeing a video of her dead husband's arrest. Esaw Garner said she was deeply upset by the footage. The mother-of-six collapsed in tears at a Saturday press conference. Heartbroken: Esaw Garner, whose husband Eric died during an arrest Thursday, is held by the Rev Al Sharpton, right, and Rev Herbert Daughtry, on Saturday . Grief: Esaw, pictured with Eric, says she struggled to watch the footage of her husband's final moments . The officer believed to have used the chokehold, who has not yet been identified, may lose his job, a law enforcement source said. 'It violates protocol. It violates a direct rule which is never to put somebody in a choke hold,' the unidentified source told the New York Post. Earlier footage released Friday shows one officer put Garner in a chokehold - a maneuver barred under NYPD practice code - while police tried to arrest him over claims he was selling bootleg cigarettes. Garner's wife watched footage of the arrest, and her 43-year-old husband's final moments on a sidewalk, on Friday. 'They killed him. They choked him and took him down and I could hear him screaming that he couldn’t breathe,' she told the Daily News, which has an exclusive copy of the film. 'It was so hard to watch. He was a non-violent gentle giant, and they killed him.' Grief: Esaw comforts Emerald, one of her and Eric's six children, during a press conference with the Rev Al Sharpton on Saturday . Despair: Daughtry and Sharpton support Esaw as she collapses in tears after hearing details of her husband's death . Memorial: Prayer candles, flowers and messages are left at the spot where Garner was arrested before his death . Members of the community join in prayer during a demonstration on Saturday over Garner's death . The 46-year-old was comforted by the Reverend Al Sharpton at the Saturday press conference held by Sharpton's National Action Network. She sobbed uncontrollably as Sharpton described the circumstances of her husband's death. 'The issue is not if one was selling [untaxed] cigarettes, the issue is that an unarmed man was subjected to a chokehold and the result is he is no longer with us,' Sharpton said. Sharpton then joined the family on a peaceful demonstration through Staten Island, to protest the circumstances of Garner's death. In the video Garner, who was not armed, is heard denying that he has been involved in illegal activity when a plainclothes police officer accosted him. 'Every time you see me you want to mess with me. I’m tired of it. It stops today!' Garner griped. Family tragedy: Father-of-six Eric Garner, 43, died on Thursday after being put in a . chokehold by police and pinned to the ground on Staten Island . A rally is held to protest over Garner's death after police put him in a chokehold . The Rev Al Sharpton marches with members of the Garner family on Saturday in memory of Eric, who died Thursday . When he is put on the ground by five cops while . being handcuffed, Garner was yelling out that he couldn't breathe, . according to several witnesses who watched the arrest. 'They jumped him and they were choking . him. He was foaming at the mouth. And that's it. He was done,' Ramsey Orta, who took the . video, told The Daily News. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has postponed a family trip to Italy to ensure the investigation gets underway. In a statement released Friday, he extended his sympathy to the victim's family, and promised a 'full and thorough investigation'. 'We have a responsibility to keep every New Yorker safe, and that includes when individuals are in custody of the NYPD,' de Blasio said. Missed: Eric Garner was described as a gentle giant by those who knew him . Confrontation: Eric Garner was stopped by police on this sidewalk . After the incident, posters saying 'no justice, no peace' 'and Another innocent black man has been killed by police brutality. The NYPD must be stopped!' appeared in the area. The Rev Lloyd Land, from the First United Christian Church, told Staten Island Live: 'He was a gentle giant. Insofar as violence, I don't believe if you smack him in the face he would hit you back ... The police have no reason to attack him.'","Esaw Garner collapses in tears as Rev Al Sharpton holds meeting about her husband's death .

"Calf triplets have been born on a dairy farm in the North West of England at an extraordinary 700,000-1 odds. The three male calves came into the world at Greenhouse Farm, Wirral, this week after their mother, number 901, made the 'surprise' delivery. Farmer Jon Appleby has never heard of a trio of cows being born at the same time from the same mother, despite working on the farm all of his life. 700,000-1 odds: Proud farmer Jon Appleby has never heard of a trio of cows being born at the same time from the same mother, despite working on the farm in Wirral all of his life . Jon, 44, said: 'I've been here for over four decades and my dad has been farming for 75 years. We've never heard of cows having triplets. It's very very rare. 'I couldn't quite believe it when I saw three calves. She'd had two and we thought that was it - it's not uncommon for twins to be born. 'But we looked again and a third had been born. She was in a field on her own so they're definitely all hers!' Jon, who runs Greenhouse Farm in . Greasby, Wirral, with his wife Joy, has 74 cows in total and since they . began calving at the beginning of August, they have had around 180 new . arrivals. Family portrait: the triplets are 'the most special of the farm's new generation' However the triplets are without a doubt, the most special of the farm's new generation. Father-of-two Jon said: 'They are all boys and because they arrived so soon after the Royal baby, we decided to call them George, Louis and Alexander. 'It's a little moment in history us having such a rare arrival so it was only right to mark the occasion. Come along: Apart from 73 other cows, the farm has more than 3,000 hens and houses a free range egg business . 'Number 901 was big during her pregnancy so we expected twins but it never even crossed our minds we might have triplets. It's incredible.' The family also house more than 3,000 hens and run a free range egg business from the farm. Only last week, they cracked one to find it was a triple yolker. 'It had to be a sign,' said Jon. 'People get excited over double yolkers, but we had a triple and then a few days later had triplet calves. Someone was trying to tell us something!' The three young calves are not idential triplets, which means they have come from three separate embryos . The calves are not identical, meaning they have come from three separate embryos. For the last two years, number 901 has given birth to single calves, and there is no indication that after having triplets, she may do this in the future. Jon said: 'We will just have to wait and see. It would be unbelievable if it happened to us again with such unlikely odds, but we will wait and see! 'For now we will enjoy the triplets. They are incredibly cute and certainly have the 'aww' factor!' And Jon's children, Ben, 14, and Theo, 10, are thrilled by their new additions. Jon added: 'They think they are great. It's lovely that we have got them. The kids are chuffed to bits. 'They like to help feed them - they'll be weaned off their mother soon so Ben and Theo will be getting their hands dirty!'","The three male calves came into the world at Greenhouse Farm, Wirral .

"Two Michigan State Rep. were blocked from speaking on the House floor yesterday after using the words ‘vagina’ and 'vasectomy' while opposing a proposed anti-abortion bill the day before. Lisa Brown, D-West Bloomfield, was told that she was not allowed participate in Thursday's debate because of her earlier ‘offensive comments’ and ‘unprofessional conduct’, according to CBS. While Rep. Barb Byrum, D-Onondaga, claims she was also prohibited from speaking on Thursday for using the word 'vasectomy' during Wednesday’s debate. Scroll down for video . Banned: Lisa Brown, D-West Bloomfield, was told that she was not allowed participate in Thursday's debate because of her comments on Wednesday . During the heated debate, Brown, who is Jewish, spoke against a proposed bill which would further regulate abortions. ‘Wherever there’s a question of the . life of the mother, or that of the unborn child, Jewish law rules in . favour of preserving the life of the mother,' she said. 'The status of the fetus as human life does not equal that of the mother. I have not asked you to adapt and adhere to my religious beliefs. Why are you asking me to adapt to yours?’ But what caused the most controversy were the closing words to Brown’s speech. ‘And finally, Mr Speaker,’ she said. ‘I'm flattered that you're all so interested in my vagina, but no means no.’ Some Representatives applauded her impassioned statement but others did not take too kindly to her bold words. 'What she said was offensive,' state Rep. Mike Callton, R-Nashville, told The Detroit News. 'It was so offensive, I don't even want to say it in front of women. I would not say that in mixed company,' he said. Silenced: Rep. Lisa Brown (left) and Rep. Barb Byrum (right) were both prohibited from speaking yesterday because of their earlier conduct . State Rep. Lisa Lyons, R-Alto, agreed. 'As a woman and mother, I was personally offended by Rep. Lisa Brown's . disgraceful actions during Wednesday's floor debate, she said. Majority Floor Leader Jim Stamas, . R-Midland, said the decision to bar Brown from speaking was not her . reference to the female anatomy, but her conduct. 'My concern was the decorum of the House, not of anything she said,' Stamas told the newspaper. 'I ask all members to maintain a decorum of the House, and I felt it went too far yesterday.' But Brown yesterday defended her decision to use the 'v-word'. 'If I can't say the word vagina, why are we legislating vaginas?' Brown said during a Capitol press conference. 'What language should I use? We're all adults here.' During the same debate, Byrum tried to introduce an amendment that would regulate vasectomies but was not allowed to speak. She protested and was declared 'out of order'. 'There were actions by Representative Byrum on the floor involving shouting in the chamber that also failed to maintain decorum,' House Speaker spokesman Ari Adler told CBS. But Byrum disagreed. 'It's my impression that I'm being banned from speaking as a result of my use of the term vasectomy - a medical procedure,' she told The Huffington Post. 'Neither of us has been contacted by Republican leadership as to why or how long we've been banned. Talk about disrespectful, that they don’t have the common decency to tell us themselves.'

"Calm first, but then crying: James, eight, was hailed a hero by his family after he saved his father's life by switching off the machine and run for help . A quick-thinking eight year old has been hailed a hero after saving his father's life in a farm accident. James Aspden came to the rescue of his dad Thomas, 52, when his arm became trapped in a hay-baling machine, which then began to pull him into the mechanism. Mr Aspden's arm was dragged into the machine up to his shoulder as he tried to free a blockage, crushing the whole of his left limb. But cool-headed James was able to . calmly follow his stricken father's instructions to turn off the . machine, using three different switches, and raise the alarm. Mr Aspden said that without his son's actions he would almost certainly have been killed. James, who has his own little tractor . and regularly helps out on the farm, said: 'I pressed the button off . and ran to mum and mum came over to the bailer then called the . ambulance.' The youngster, . who hopes to follow in his dad's footsteps and take over the family farm . one day, also described the experience as 'scary' and 'frightening'. It took fire crews two hours to free the pig farmer when they arrived at the accident near Chorley, Lancashire. Mr Aspden suffered five separate breaks to the limb and is now recovering in hospital after two operations . He was trapped so badly that there were initial fears that the arm would have to be amputated at the scene. But he was taken to hospital where doctors were able to save his arm after two operations. He suffered five separate breaks to the limb and is now recovering in hospital. His arm became trapped in a hay-baling machine, pictured, which began to pull him into the mechanism . Mr Aspden was flown to Royal Preston Hospital where he underwent surgery on the arm - pictured here with eight-year-old James and wife Thelma . Relieved . mum Thelma, 37, said: 'James was just a star. Thomas just thinks our . son is marvellous, his quick thinking has saved his arm and his life. He's just so grateful. 'I think James was so brave in such a . horrific situation to think to turn it off - most kids would have just . stood there in shock but he remained calm and his actions have saved his . dad. 'If the machine had been left on his arm would have been ripped off, or worse, he could have died.' She . said James, who is a pupil at Eccleston St Mary's Primary School, ran . screaming towards her for help after disabling the hay baling machine. 'I think James was so brave in such a horrific situation to think to turn it off,' said mum Thelma, pictured. 'Most kids would have just stood there in shock but he remained calm and his actions have saved his dad' 'I was on the other side of the field on one tractor and Thomas and James were in the other tractor baling. 'The first thing I knew was when James had run across the field to get me. I looked up and could see Thomas was on top of the baler with his arm trapped inside. 'As I got closer I could see that bones were sticking out and blood was everywhere - after a while I don't think Thomas could feel anything. I had to feel around in his pocket for his mobile phone - mine was out of battery. He was slipping in and out of consciousness, it was very worrying,' she added. She said Mr Aspden had got into difficulties after netting had become tangled in the hay baling machinery. When he tried to free it, his arm was pulled in. The air ambulance, fire engines and paramedics arrived at the scene and it was at first feared that the only way to free him would be to cut off his arm. Mrs Aspden said: 'At one point he got really upset when he heard the firefighter suggest cutting his arm off to free him, but thankfully they managed to avoid that option. Thomas knows the machine inside and out so was able to help them cut through and release him. As soon as he was set free Thomas passed out and started shaking.' Mr Aspden was flown to Royal Preston Hospital where he underwent surgery on the arm, which was found to be broken in five places. Thelma, James and his sister Abigail, 18, have been by his bedside since the incident last Thursday. 'He hopes to be out within a week. His arm is in a big cast and he is just hoping he can get the feeling back in his fingers.' Mr Aspden in hospital: His son James, wife Thelma and James' sister Abigail, 18, have been by Mr Aspden's bedside since the accident last Thursday . Abigail added: 'James stopped the machine from working and went to get help. He's amazing. I think he should get an award for this. 'He was calm at first but afterwards he was crying. I got him to a neighbour as quickly as possible to get him away from the situation. 'He couldn't have done any better, it was quick reaction.'","Mr Aspden got into difficulty after netting had .

'While the possibilities are incredibly exciting, the sums involved are very small by comparison to the investments we make in our core businesses. In terms of details, we don't comment on speculation.' The lab is reportedly located in Google's Mountain View, California headquarters - known as 'the Googleplex'. Engineers are free to work on projects such as connected fridges that order groceries when they run low - or even tableware that can connect to social networks. Other Google engineers have reportedly researched ideas as far-out as elevators to space. Google co-founder Sergey Brin is reportedly deeply involved in the lab. His business card is said to be simply a piece of silvery metal decorated with the letter X. Brin, a robot enthusiast, once attended a conference via a robot with a screen showing his face. It's not unusual for tech companies to have 'ideas labs' hidden away from their ordinary workers - at Apple, for instance, Jonathan Ive's design lab where devices such as iPads are perfected, is guarded as if it was a weapons facility.","Glasses have built-in camera, GPS and offer email and web searches on surface of glasses .

"The Indianapolis Colts football player who was suspended after taking fertility drugs has welcomed a baby girl into the world. Robert Mathis proudly posted pictures on Thursday of him cradling his newborn baby in his arms after she was born on Saturday. In a caption the Indianapolis Colts linebacker also appeared to allude to his four-game suspension over banned substances. Game changer: NFL star Robert Mathis, who was suspended after taking fertility drugs, kisses his baby girl . The NLF star fell foul of American football rules in May when he tested positive for Clomid, which is on the banned substance list because of its affect on testosterone levels. Mathis had argued that the drug was part of fertility treatment he was undergoing as he and wife Brandi tried for a third child. The couple, who have twin boys, decided to expand their family to honor a request from the football player's mother, who is fighting cancer. When he acknowledged taking the banned substance in May, Mathis admitted he had made a mistake by not checking if the drug would be a problem during testing. But the woes surrounding his suspension from the first four games of the suspension were far from the 32-year-old's thoughts this week. Suspended: Indianapolis Colts player Robert Mathis, pictured in December, has been barred from the first four games of the season . Prepared: Mathis puts on a hospital overall as he gets ready to meet his daughter . His Instagram page showed pictures of his newborn daughter next to a post where he had written: 'Last time i address it then after that may god bless it: I have no opinion on anyone else's situation bc #myunit don't benefit from it. 'This is my current situation in my arms and that's that! #gocolts #fff(in that order).' Previously, he had posted pictures of him wearing hospital scrubs as his wife prepared to give birth. '#SuperPoppz checking in for duty!!! sound the alarm #ThePrincessIsComing,' he had written on the day the baby was born. Supporters of the football player posted messages of congratulations, and said they were looking forward to seeing him back in action after the suspension ends. Back in the game: Mathis will rejoin his team on September 29 . The Colts had also supported Mathis, who had appealed against the NFL ruling because of his reasons for needing to take the substance. 'Everybody in this organization has his back and we'll get through this and at the end of the day, we'll all be better for it,' coach Chuck Pagano told NFL.com. The proud father and linebacker is due to make his first appearance of the season on September 29.","Robert Mathis and his wife were having treatment to expand their family .

"James McCarthy is almost certainly out of the Merseyside derby after suffering another setback that will extend his injury misery. The Everton midfielder, who has not played since December 28, aggravated his hamstring during a training session and could be facing another two weeks on the sidelines, which would mean him missing the game with Liverpool and the trip to Chelsea next Wednesday. It is a huge blow for manager Roberto Martinez, who had been hoping to relaunch McCarthy's season at Crystal Palace last weekend, and the 24-year-old, who has now suffered four hamstring problems since the end of November.

"A Los Angeles man who has been jailed for a crime he didn't commit since April 27 has finally been released from prison. Authorities released Gerber Guzman from LA County Jail where he's been held since his arrest on drug dealing charges. Guzman's wife, Yanira Hernadez, says this is the second time her husband has been wrongly imprisoned since his identity was stolen six years ago. Innocent: Gerber Guzman has been imprisoned for a total of one month for crimes he never committed . The first jail stint Guzman endured lasted 16 days before his name was cleared with the help of U.S. Marshals, reports CBS Los Angeles. Injustice: Gerber Guzman was finally released to be with his heavily pregnant wife and their two children after his ordeal . Hernandez says that the first time her . husband was released, U.S. marshals realized that the fingerprints they . had on file for Gerber Guzman did not match those of her husband. This time, the DEA told her it was the U.S. Marshals who were holding her husband. 'They . cannot let him go, because the U.S. Marshals are the ones that have the . hold,' Hernandez said. 'It’s really hard when you have kids, and you . have one on the way, and your kids ask you twenty-four/seven, ""Where’s . daddy?""' Last month, Guzman was pulled over for an expired car registration and taken into custody when the police officer realized there was a warrant outstanding for his arrest. He was in prison for 12 days before he was released. Now, Guzman and Hernandez want to know how the same error could have occurred twice. 'The . thing is that they know it’s not him, but they still have him in there, . and that’s what’s heartbreaking,' Hernandez, who is eight months . pregnant, told CBS. 'They told us it wasn’t going to happen again, and fast-forward six years later, it happened again.' Hernandez says she tried to get her husband released to no avail, and in desperation contacted CBS with her story. Stolen identity: Gerber Guzman's identity was stolen six years ago, and since then he's twice been arrested on drugs charges that he is innocent of, says his wife Yanira Hernandez . Relief: Yanira Hernandez reacts as she learns that her husband will be released from prison imminently . The DEA confirmed Wednesday to the station that they were aware of Hernandez's claims. 'DEA is aware of claims that the man in custody is not the same person for whom the arrest warrant was issued. DEA takes all allegations of this nature seriously and is currently using ever resource at our disposal to address the matter,' read a statement released by the DEA.

"Scroll down for video . Warm weather is causing more patients to be diagnosed with kidney stones, scientists have revealed. Higher temperatures contribute to dehydration, which increases the risk of kidney stones in those people predisposed to the condition, a new study has found. Researchers at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia examined 60,000 patients in several cities across the U.S., with varying climates, discovering a link between hot days and kidney stones. The study raises the theory that as the planet warms up climate change is taking its toll on human health. A new study carried out at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia has found that as average temperatures rise above 10°C a person's risk of developing painful kidney stones increases . Lead researcher and urologist, Gregory Tasian, said: 'We found that as daily temperatures rise, there is a rapid increase in the probability of patients presenting over the next 20 days with kidney stones. The team analysed medical records of more than 60,000 adults and children with kidney stones between 2005 and 2011 in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and Philadelphia as well as weather records for each city. They recorded the risk of stone presentation for the full range of temperatures in each city. As average daily temperatures rose above 10°C, the risk of a person getting kidney stones increased in all cities, except LA. The delay between a person being out in the hot weather and developing stones was short, peaking within three days of exposure to high temperatures. 'These findings point to potential public health effects associated with global climate change,' said Mr Tasian. 'However, although 11 per cent of the U.S. population has had kidney stones, most people have not. 'It is likely that higher temperatures increase the risk of kidney stones in those people predisposed to stone formation.' Higher temperatures increase the risk a person will become dehydrated, which leads to a higher concentration of calcium and other minerals in the urine, which cause stones to grow in the kidneys. It is a painful condition, which causes around 500,000 patients to visit emergency departments across the U.S. each year. And the number of cases has increased markedly across the world in the last 10 years. While stones remain more common in adults, the numbers of children developing kidney stones has soared in the last 25 years. Scientists examined the medical records of 60,000 patients, in five U.S. cities. They compared the prevalence of kidney stones, pictured left on an X-ray and right after extraction from a patient, and weather patterns. The researchers warned global warming could be a factor behind the rising number of cases . Lead researcher and urologist, Gregory Tasian, said: 'With some experts predicting that extreme temperatures will become the norm in 30 years, children will bear the brunt of climate change' The factors causing the increase in kidney stones are currently unknown, but are thought to be influenced by changes in diet and fluid intake. When stones do not pass on their own, surgery is often necessary. The new study also found extremely low temperatures increased the risk of kidney stones in three cities - Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia. Kidney stones are stone-like lumps that can develop in one or both kidneys. When stones cause severe pain, it is known as renal colic. Small stones may be passed out painlessly in the urine and may even go undetected. But it is common for a stone to block part of the urinary system, including the: . The waste products in the blood can cause crystals to form, collecting inside the kidney. Over time the crystals build up to form a hard, stone-like lump. It is more likely to happen if a person does not drink enough fluid. Some medications also increase the chances of stones developing. Kidney stones are common, affecting people aged 30 to 60 years old. They affect more men than women. While most small stones pass in the urine, larger stones may need to be broken up with X-rays or ultrasound in hospital. In some cases surgery is needed. Source: NHS Choices . The researchers said low temperatures causes more people to stay inside in the warm, causing changes in diet and decreased exercise levels, which could increase risk of stone formation. They argued that the number of hot days in a year, may better predict the risk of a person suffering kidney stones, compared to the average annual temperature. Atlanta and LA share the same annual temperature, of 17°C, but Atlanta has more hot days than LA - as well as twice the prevalence of kidney stones. Tasian added that while the five cities chosen for their study are representative of those found across the world, more research is needed to explore the current findings. Future studies should examine how risk patterns vary in different populations, including among children, which only represented a small percentage of those analysed in the current study. The team's findings have a broader context, in the patterns of global warming. The authors note that other scientists have reported overall global temperatures between 2000 and 2009 were higher than 82 per cent of temperatures over the last 11,300 years. Furthermore, increases in greenhouse gas emissions are expected to raise Earth's average temperatures by 1 to 4.5°C by 2100. Tasian added: 'Kidney stone prevalence has already been on the rise over the last 30 years, and we can expect this trend to continue, both in greater numbers and over a broader geographic area, as daily temperatures increase. 'With some experts predicting that extreme temperatures will become the norm in 30 years, children will bear the brunt of climate change.

"Senior Ukip figures are claiming two more Tory MPs are ‘in the bag’ and will be unveiled as defectors within days. To the alarm of Conservative HQ, Ukip party secretary Matthew Richardson has boasted privately that two turncoats have agreed to switch parties, according to two separate sources. Mr Richardson has told colleagues an announcement could be made as early as Ukip’s conference, which opens today in Doncaster. Chris Kelly, pictured left, and Brian Binley, pictured right, both from the Tory party, are two right-wingers who have announced they are standing down as MPs. They are likely to be Ukip targets for defection . One potential defector is said to be a Tory MP who is to stand down at next year’s general election and would sit for Ukip for the next seven months. The other is said to be a Tory currently planning to run again in 2015. Likely Ukip targets include Chris Kelly and Brian Binley, two right-wingers who have announced that they are standing down as MPs. Others thought to be have been identified by Ukip as potential targets are Gordon Henderson, Mark Reckless and Martin Vickers. The Conservative whips’ office headed by Michael Gove and in charge of party discipline is understood to be seeking assurances from MPs thought to be likely Ukip targets. The Conservatives are already braced for Clacton MP Douglas Carswell, who defected to Ukip over the summer, to hold the seat in a by-election on October 9. If he wins, he will become Ukip’s first elected MP, though a former Tory defector, Bob Spink, sat in the Commons for the party from 2008 to 2010. While the Tories believe a victory for Mr Carswell is ‘priced in’, further defections would be a shattering blow to David Cameron with a general election just months away. Ukip has previously claimed it has been in contact with eight Tory MPs. Asked about his reported remarks, Mr Richardson said: ‘I may have predicted that there will be two more people [ready to defect]. 'But I don’t know for certain. I can’t talk to you about this for reasons that will no doubt be clear. When Douglas Carswell announced his defection it took us all by surprise.’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage, left, pictured with Clacton MP Douglas Carswell, who defected from Tory to Ukip earlier this summer . Mr Richardson suggested that a recall of Parliament over military action in Iraq or Syria tomorrow could delay any potential announcement. All of the MPs denied any intention of joining Ukip. Chris Kelly referred the Mail to the statement on his website saying he stood down because he ‘found it increasingly difficult to find the right balance between my work and my personal and family life’. He said friends had asked him to join Ukip but he had said no and had not been in any negotiations with them. A poll by Lord Ashcroft, a Conservative peer and former donor, found Ukip has a 32 point lead on the Tories in Mr Carswell’s Clacton constituency. His survey, published on the ConservativeHome website, found Ukip had 56 per cent support, while the Tories were on 24 per cent and Labour on 16 per cent. The Liberal Democrats and others were on 2 per cent each. Almost six in ten of those who voted Conservative at the last general election said they would switch to Ukip, as did 45 per cent of 2010 Labour voters. More than two-thirds of those planning to vote Ukip in the by-election, which is taking place on Mr Cameron’s 48th birthday, said a large part of their decision was that Mr Carswell was ‘the best candidate locally’.","Announcement could be made at Ukip's conference, which opens today .

"When a cargo ship carrying 66 women convicts to Australia was seized in the 18th century, it became one of the most infamous mutinies of all time. Now a diary written by the carpenter has shed new light on the incident which happened on the Lady Shore off the coast of South America. Today the work, produced by Thomas Millard, from Deptford, south London, sold for £12,500 at auction. Convict ship: The Lady Shore, like this ship, was heading for Australia when the mutiny happened in 1797 off the coast of South America . The ship was heading from Gravesend, Kent, to Bontany Bay in 1797 when it was seized by the French soldiers employed to guard the convicts. The women on board had been sentenced to an average of seven years' transportation for committing minor offences such as theft. Captain James Willcocks was murdered and 28 people were cut adrift off the coast of Brazil in an echo of the Mutiny of Bounty. All of the survivors ended up in Spanish South America and they were imprisoned and held in appalling conditions. The 30-month journal reveals details of the mutiny, the suffering on board and their relationships with the men. Millard writes how he was woken up by the sound of the captain being shot dead as the mutiny happened on August 1, 1797. 'We ware Alarm'd by the firing of Musketts on the deck and to my Great Surpris the Capt falling down the steeridge ladder which woke me out of my Sleep,' he writes. Another officer was shouting: 'Give them the ship, Give them the ship.' Millard records: 'I was afraid ever minute that some or the others would Blow my brains out with Pistol or run the Bayonets into me.' He tells how the ship's purser, John Black, tried to kill himself because he did not want to be murdered by the French mutineers. '[He] jumped out of the Cuddey [cabin] window that he should say these words that the Frenchmen should not have the pleasure of taking his life and was drowned.' But, he added, 'to our great surprise' Black later 'entered the Cabbin with with Blue Cross bar silk Handkerchief tied about his head he looked if he had been crying very much.' Millard, as the carpenter, was kept on the ship against his will. Under the hammer: Carpenter Thomas Millard's journal, which was 320 pages long, chronicling the mutiny and the 18 months that followed . His skills were used to prepare the longboat in which the 28 men, women and children used to make it through violent storms to Brazil. The mutineers had wanted to reach South America as Spain was an ally of France at the time. But when the Lady Shore arrived on the River Plate on August 28, everyone was imprisoned. He recalls how at Christmas the prisoners made punch and drank the health of the king despite the gloom. The Spanish authorities had been uncertain how to treat the new arrivals. Many of the 66 women convicts were taken on as unpaid servants in Buenos Aires. Millard was allowed out to work for a shipwright during the day but returned to prison at night. He was more fortunate than most; in the summer of 1799 he was allowed to sail in the Liberty to America, where he settled in New Jersey, took a wife and raised two children. The 320-page journal was auctioned after being put up for sale by Millard's American descendants. Sotheby's specialist Dr Gabriel Heaton said: 'It is a fascinating story of early colonial history, presenting a totally new view of events by a man kept on board against his will and forced to work for the mutineers. 'He gives a fresh account of the fight for the ship, the death of Captain Willcocks and the abandonment of the crew in the longboat but also provides an exceptionally important record of events after landing in South America. 'He makes frequent references to the desperately unlucky convict women, the conditions of their confinement, the relationships that developed between the men and the women of the Lady Shore, the births and deaths of children and other details that provide glimpses into the extraordinary lives of an unfortunate group of women who found themselves prisoners of war thousands of miles from home.'","Lady Shore was carrying 66 women convicts when the mutiny happened off the coast of South America .

Ms Heintz says the service also means Australians won't have to wait any longer than Americans for products that haven't yet hit local stores. ShopMate isn't the first service of its kind offered in Australia, but it's the first that won't rely on international couriers that can sometimes be more costly. Subscribers can have their parcels sent to their 'US address' before they're forwarded to Australia . Australia Post charges a base rate of $24.95 a parcel, with a weight rate of $5.95 per 500 grams. Mr Godfrey said Choice welcomed Australia Post's decision, but said the lengths consumers have to go to avoid being ripped off were 'staggering'. 'The fact that Australia Post can set up a service like this to help people avoid geo-blocking is testament to how broken online shopping is in Australia,' Mr Godfrey said.

"Persian cat: Space program official Mohammad Ebrahimi said Iran's next space capsule could carry the Persian cat, breed named after Iran's former name of Persia . As Iran steps up its space programme with plans to send a human into space by 2018, the country has been using animals as test astronauts and may now turn to the distinctive, and locally named, Persian cat. The move comes seven months after Iran claimed it launched a monkey out of earth's atmosphere and successfully returned it home, although the claims were questioned after photos appeared to show different monkeys before the launch and after it allegedly returned. The plan is seen by Western countries as another possible step by Iran's ambitious aerospace programme, which has also raised concerns about spillover military applications. But a senior space program official, Mohammad Ebrahimi, tried to quash doubts over its success in sending a money into space by saying state media had mistakenly sent out a photo of an alternate monkey that was not used in the February launch. He insisted just one monkey, Pishgam or Pioneer, was sent on the 20-minute flight to a height of 72 miles and returned safely. In 2010, Iranian officials said it sent a mouse, a turtle and some worms on a space flight - also part of the country's goals of sending a human into space by 2018 and becoming a leading tech center for the Islamic world. Ebrahimi said Iran's next space capsule could carry the Persian cat, a long-haired, flat-faced breed named after Iran's former name of Persia. He said the launch will happen by the end of Iran's current year, which ends March 21. A mouse and rabbit are also under consideration. Ebrahimi said the next launch would be with a larger, liquid-fueled rocket and and launched 72 miles up. Past launches were done with solid-fueled boosters, whose technology can be used in long-range missiles. He did not explain the reason for the rocket change, but may be an attempt to ease international concerns at a time when Iran's new moderate-leaning president, Hasan Rouhani, is seeking to revive nuclear talks with world powers. Iranian officials insist a monkey, called Pishgam (or Pioneer) pictured, was sent on a 20-minute flight to a height of 72 miles and returned safely . Iran says it wants to put its own satellites into orbit to monitor natural disasters in the earthquake-prone nation, improve telecommunications and expand military surveillance in the region. Earlier this year, the then President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said he wanted to be Iran's first astronaut.","The move comes seven months after Iran claimed it launched a monkey out of earth's atmosphere .

"The death this week of press secretary James Brady, who was paralyzed during an attempted assassination against President Reagan in 1981, has been ruled a murder. Brady, 73, had used a wheelchair since the shooting outside the Washington Hilton Hotel, and his speech was slurred. A medical examiner ruled Friday that his death on Monday was a result of the grievous injuries he received in the attack. Scroll down for video . Charges: The death on Monday of former press secretary James Brady, who was shot during an attempted assassination against President Reagan, has been ruled a homicide . Attack: This photograph from March, 1980, shows a U.S. secret service agent with an automatic weapon watching over James Brady (center and Washington DC police officer, Thomas Delahanty, left) the president's secretary, after being wounded in an attempt on the life of President Ronald Reagan in Washington . The gunman, John Hinckley Jr, is in a mental hospital after he was found not guilty of attempted assassination by reason of insanity. However, the ruling over Brady's death opens up the possibility that a murder charge could be brought against him, NBC4 reported. District of Columbia police spokeswoman Gwendolyn Crump said that the department was notified of the homicide ruling earlier today. NBC justice correspondent Pete Williams said: 'We are a long way from . knowing what the federal authorities are going to do with this.' Any charges made against Hinckley could have an impact on efforts by his family to get permanent leave from a secure hospital granted for him.

Three others, including Brady who was hit in the head by a bullet, were seriously wounded.

"Rene Lima-Marin's wife told her two young sons their father had to go to work the night in January when a team of police officers led her husband away in handcuffs. It had been nearly six years since he left prison, and his family believed he had paid his debt to society. But Lima-Marin should have stayed behind bars for the rest of his life. A court clerk's error led to his release in 2008 — 90 years too soon. Scroll down for video . Torn apart: Rene Lima-Marin jokes around with children Justus, 7, and Josiah, 4, in Aurora, Colo. He will now spend the rest of his life in prison after court officials realized they had mistakenly released him after only eight years . Heartbroken: Jasmine Lima-Marin said her husband was not aware his release was a mistake and that he was not hiding from authorities . Rene Lima Marin stands with his wife Jasmine and children Justus, 7, and Josiah, 4, at their home in Aurora, Colo. Colorado authorities did not discover the mistake until January and immediately sent him back to prison to serve the rest of his 98-year sentence for armed robbery. Lima-Marin's case comes as other clerical errors have let criminals evade prison time. In Missouri, a judge this week freed a convicted robber who didn't report to prison — despite trying to do so — for 13 years because of a clerical mistake. A Los Angeles murder suspect who was accidentally freed last year due to a clerk's error was captured on Thursday. And in Colorado, an inmate mistakenly released four years early due to such a mistake killed the state's corrections chief at his front door last year. That prompted Gov. John Hickenlooper to order an audit of thousands of inmates' records to ensure they are serving the correct sentences. Lima-Marin wasn't part of the audit because it focused on other kinds of felonies, corrections department spokeswoman Adrienne Jacobson said. After being released from prison in 2008, Rene Lima-Marin reconnected with his old girlfriend, Jasmine, and helped raised her son, Justus, 7, before having a son together, Josiah, 4 . Lima-Marin and another man were convicted in 2000 after robbing two Aurora video stores when Lima-Marin was 20. In one robbery, they ordered employees into a back room at gunpoint, and a worker was ordered to the floor as they demanded money from a safe. A judge sentenced Lima-Marin to serve back-to-back sentences on eight convictions, for a total of 98 years. But a court clerk mistakenly wrote in his file that the sentences were to run at the same time. Corrections officials depend on that file to determine how much time an inmate should serve. Lima-Marin was released on parole in 2008 after serving just eight years. He set about building his life — while, prosecutors say, being fully aware of the clerical error and never notifying authorities. Lima-Marin, now 35, started selling coupon books door-to-door, and more recently became skilled at cutting and installing windows. He reconnected with his former girlfriend, Jasmine Lima-Marin, and they married in July in a ceremony that also celebrated his completion of five years of parole. He was active in church and helped coach soccer. Lima-Marin helped Jasmine raise her 7-year-old son, Justus. Jasmine Lima-Marin said her family has been torn apart by her husband renewed prison sentence . Soon, they had another boy, Josiah, who is now 4. Lima-Marin in prison for his birthday party. 'That was his life, raising his kids and being a husband,' Jasmine said. 'He definitely was not the same person that he was when he went in to prison.' Lima-Marin's co-defendant, Michael Clifton, also would have been mistakenly released early, but the error in his file was uncovered after he filed an appeal in his case. Clifton is serving 98 years in prison. Lima-Marin filed his own appeal in 2000 but, in a rare move, asked that it be dismissed less than a year later. Prosecutors say that showed he was aware of the clerical error before his release and feared any further court action would call attention to it. Rich Orman, an Arapahoe County senior deputy district attorney, said he was alerted to the error in January by a former prosecutor who handled Lima-Marin's case and was checking on its status. Orman quickly filed a motion to send Lima-Marin back to prison. A judge agreed. 'He should go back because the law requires the sentence he received. This was a number of very serious criminal offenses, and anything less would be inappropriate,' Orman said. 'He should not be able to escape the minimum sentence due to a clerical error.' Lima-Marin became skilled at cutting and installing windows after leaving prison. He helped coach soccer and was an active church member . Jacobson, with the state corrections department, said it was the court that made the mistake and prison officials would not have known Lima-Marin was released incorrectly. Colorado State Public Defender Doug Wilson did not return calls seeking comment. In April, a judge declined to release Lima-Marin at his public defender's request, noting that Lima-Marin knew he should have served 98 years but remained silent about the mistake. The Associated Press reached out to Lima-Marin for comment but he has not responded. 'We don't have secrets. If he knew there was a mistake, he would have told me,' Jasmine said. She said her husband did not try to mask his identity. The prospect of Lima-Marin remaining imprisoned for nine more decades has devastated his family. They argue his clean life after prison shows he has been punished enough. Jasmine said they are considering another appeal and have reached out to the attorney involved in the recent Missouri case. 'He was given an opportunity to live again and it was taken away from him,' Jasmine said.","Rene Lima-Marin was sentenced in 2000 for robbery, kidnapping and burglary after robbing two Aurora video stores when he was 18 .

"Comic book fans have been rocked by an unexpected move by Marvel, which has revealed that Thor is now a woman.

Daring: Marvel have revealed that Thor will be a woman in the next series of comics . Many questioned how the plot line will allow for this mysterious blonde woman to take over the hammer of Thor, speculating on whether she is a long-lost relative. But Marvel has said simply that the new character using the power of Mjölnir - the hammer - is Thor. 'This new Thor isn't a temporary female substitute - she's now the one and only Thor, and she is worthy!' Marvel editor Wil Moss said. 'The inscription on Thor's hammer reads ""Whosoever holds this hammer, if HE be worthy, shall possess the power . of Thor."" Well it's time to update that inscription.' Fans are seeming more resistant to the change, which will mark the new series by Jason Aaron and illustrated by Russell Dauterman.

Changes: The hammer-wielding god of thunder has appeared in his masculine form since the 1960s . Makeover: Marvel hopes to attract a new audience with Thor as a strong female character .

"Noma restaurant in Copenhagen, Denmark, has real straw, live ants and fish scales on its menu . It has been voted the world’s best restaurant for four out of the past five years – but Michelin starred Noma’s co-founder will today reveal that his own father is not a fan. In an interview on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, the Danish chef Rene Redzepi reveals that his Macedonian father, who grew up in poverty, remains unimpressed by both his success and the menu at his Copenhagen restaurant, which includes real straw, live ants and fish scales. Redzepi, 36, says: ‘My mother is so proud but my father, it’s not for him. ‘He grew up after the Second World War in the former Yugoslavia eating the same pot of beans every day. When presenter Kirsty Young asks the chef if the food is too rarefied for his father he replies: ‘It’s just not for him’. 'When we got our second Michelin star he said, “That’s good son, now you can support your family.” To him the measure of success is that you can support your family. That’s what worried him most of his life.’ Luckily, not everyone shares his father’s taste.

The restaurant has its own team of foragers who collect ingredients from all over Scandinavia and Redzepi will today admit that his team can spend months working on ‘a carrot dish’. But the chef also said that building up the business had a terrible impact on his health and almost caused him to have a breakdown. He revealed that the pressures became so great that he found himself becoming a tyrant in his own kitchen. He said: ‘I was terrible. I had always told myself I wasn’t going to be like that. In some kitchens I had been in I had even seen people getting beat up. 'I wasn’t going to be like that. But suddenly you are there and the pressure it grows and it grows and grows. And there is no money. I started becoming very angry and very miserable.’ Redzepi whose song choices include Under Pressure by David Bowie and Queen recalled the moment he realised he couldn’t go on. He said: ‘It’s not that many years ago.  It was Spring and we were busy as usual and under staffed as usual. I was walking to work and out of the blue  I had this overwhelming feeling of not being able to walk any more. I remember telling myself I feel like laying down and crying. 'I stood there and I felt so weak. Like I have never felt before. I probably stood there for five or six minutes. And I already sort of surrendered to the thought that this was going to happen. And I was thinking who is going to take care of me? 'Who can carry me back to my apartment?  I was really, really, really having one of those crazy moments. I haven’t had it since luckily.’ The chef said it was the thought of an apprentice struggling to cope in his absence which brought him back to his senses.","Rene Redzepi's Noma has been voted the world’s best restaurant for four out of the past five years .

"Support: Liberal Democrat minister Norman Lamb said he would vote in favour of Lord Falconer's Bill . MPs have expressed support for new legislation on assisted suicide which will be put before Parliament in months - bringing the act a step closer to becoming legal. The Government is giving MPs a free vote on Lord Falconer's Bill, which would allow doctors to help terminally ill people to die to relieve their suffering. Under current law, it is illegal to assist someone to take their own life - with a punishment of up to 14 years in jail. Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrat minister responsible for care of the elderly and disabled, told the Sunday Telegraph he would vote in favour of the move. He said the Government 'should not stand in the way' of people who wish to end their life - providing that regulations are put in place. And Labour MPs Dame Joan Ruddock and Paul Blomfield have also spoken out in support of the legalisation of assisted suicide. Observers in Parliament predict just over 30 per cent of MPs would back a change in the law, with up to 40 per cent undecided -  while opinion polls have suggested that up to three quarters of the public support assisted suicide. The new Bill, drawn up by Lord Falconer to legalise 'assisted dying', would enable doctors to prescribe a fatal dose of drugs to people who have less than six months to live. Case: The Government is giving MPs a free vote on the Bill, which would allow doctors to help terminally ill people to die to relieve their suffering. Above, Tony Nicklinson, who was left suffering from 'locked-in' syndrome following a stroke. He was told by a judge in 2012 he could not choose to end his life with a doctor's help . Distraught: Following the trial, Mr Nicklinson said he had been condemned to 'a life of increasing indignity' Although the patients would take the drugs themselves, doctors would be able to help them if they struggled to swallow the substance. However, the lethal dose would have to be signed off by two doctors. The Bill is expected to be put before the House of Lords in the next four months - before being passed to the Commons, if supported. Advocate: In recent years, author Sir Terry Pratchett, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2007, has become a vocal advocate of assisted dying being legalised and regulated in the UK . Under the 1961 Suicide Act, those who deliberate assist or encourage others to commit suicide can be sentenced to up to 14 years in prison. However, in 2010, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, issued guidelines making clear that anyone who assists a loved one who has reached a 'settled and informed' decision while 'acting out of compassion' is unlikely to be charged. The guidelines were the result of a case brought by Debbie Purdy, a terminally ill woman, who in 2008 won a ruling requiring Mr Starmer to set out whether her husband would be convicted for accompanying her to the Swiss Dignitas clinic to die. While euthanasia . is prohibited in Switzerland, the penal code states that assisted . suicide is legal if no selfish interests are involved. The issue of assisted suicide is highly controversial - and has been highlighted in recent years by a number of celebrities and high-profile cases. In August 2012, Tony Nicklinson, a sufferer of 'locked-in' syndrome, was told by a judge he could not choose to end his life with a doctor's help. Following the trial, Mr Nicklinson, who died just six days later after refusing food, said he had been condemned by the law to ‘a life of increasing indignity and misery. But Lord Falconer's Bill would not have applied to his situation - with doctors only allowed to help patients with less than six months to live. It would also not apply to Paul Lamb, a former builder and a father-of-two, who has been almost totally . paralysed since a car crash in 1990 and wants a doctor to . help him to die. Death: Assisted suicide has been further highlighted by ITV's drama Coronation Street, which in January, featured terminally ill character Hayley Cropper ending her own life - although this was not classified as assisted dying. Above, Hayley Cropper and her husband Roy . The Bill, however, would have enabled Diane Pretty, a motor-neurone disease sufferer who took her right-to-die battle to the European Court of Human Rights, to end her own life. In recent years, author Sir Terry Pratchett, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2007, has become a vocal advocate of assisted dying being legalised and regulated in the UK - saying: 'I live in hope I can jump before I am pushed.' The issue has been further highlighted . by ITV's drama Coronation Street, which in January, featured terminally . ill character Hayley Cropper ending her own life - although this was . not classified as an assisted suicide. Condemnation: However, David Cameron (left) and Nicky Clegg (right) have spoken out against assisted suicide . Supporters of assisted dying claim a change in the law would allow terminally ill patients to die peacefully and in dignity. However, doctors, church officials and judges have warned that a legislative change could leave vulnerable people at risk. In December, one of the country’s most . distinguished judges claimed allowing the terminally ill to be killed . would cross ‘a line in the sand’ towards euthanasia. 'Crossing a line': In December, Baroness Butler-Sloss claimed allowing the terminally ill to be killed would cross 'a line in the sand' towards euthanasia. Above, the judge leaves the High Court in London . Baroness Butler-Sloss said: ‘The law rests on the principle that we do not involve ourselves in deliberately bringing about the deaths of others. ‘Once we start making exceptions based on arbitrary criteria like terminal illness, that frontier becomes just a line in the sand, easily crossed and hard to defend.' Prime Minister David Cameron and Liberal Democrat deputy Nicky Clegg have also spoken out against assisted suicide. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: 'The Government believes that any change to the law in this emotive and contentious area is an issue of individual conscience and a matter for Parliament to decide rather than Government policy.'

He added: 'Our first concern was the welfare of visitors but we also didn't want the birds to come to any harm. 'It was a worry that one of the chicks might fall out as we drove around. 'Ultimately they'll nest wherever they want to nest and there's nothing we can do about it. 'Swallows do have predators on the reserve so I suppose they just thought it was a safe environment. 'The birds seemed very happy and, as we returned from tours, you could almost set your watch by the parents returning with a mouthful of food to feed their chicks.' Warden Darren Williams, 45, said he felt like a dad again as he carefully monitored the new borns' progress while going about his daily job . A special swallow hammock, crafted from netting, was rigged up to catch the chicks in case they fell out as the Land Rover bounced around the reserve's rough terrain. The chicks recently fledged and now follow the vehicle around the reserve. 'You can never entirely predict migration behaviour,' Mr Williams said.

"The dress size of the average British woman has grown from 12 to 16 in just over a decade . Fashion stores are being urged to show their clothes on larger sized shop mannequins to reflect the true shapes of modern women. Leading . a Government drive to promote body confidence among women, equalities . minister Jo Swinson has called on high street stores to feature a wider . range of dummies on their shop floor. The dress size of the average British woman has grown from 12 to 16 in just over a decade, but stores are still displaying the latest trends on size 10 dummies. The reason for this, according to healty eating campaigners, is the skinny 'waif' culture, which has . dominated the fashion industry for over two decades and been linked to . eating disorders among women. However, Debenhams in Oxford Street, London, is . preparing to display a range of size 16 mannequins in its flagship . store - its summer catalogue featured an amputee while three models were aged . 40-plus and one was almost 70. Jo Swinson told the Sunday Times: 'I . would really like to see more retailers doing the same. Many customers . want to see more realistic images in magazines, TV and on the high . street, and having mannequins that reflect and celebrate our diverse society is a really positive way of helping to achieve this. 'The images we see in the world of fashion are all pretty much the same - it's as if there's only one way of being beautiful'. The move has also been welcomed by healthy eating campaigners, who say the small sized mannequins can cause low self-esteem in women with fuller figures because they feel guilty that the clothes do not look as good on them as on the models. Normal people: Debenhams in Oxford Street, London (pictured above) is preparing to display a range of size 16 mannequins in its flagship store . Susan Ringwood, chief executive of . the Beat charity which advises ministers on how to tackle eating . disorders said: 'Showing real body shapes would only enhance people's . body confidence.' But not all fashion stores and chains are eager to promote the plus size. The Arcadia Group, which includes Topshop, criticised for using a painfully thin size-zero model in its website, said its mannequins reflected the profiles of its customers. It was for Topshop that supermodel and original 'waif' Kate Moss designed her own clothes range from 2007 which became bestsellers here and in the US. Miss Selfridge mannequins are also mainly size 10 while the Dorothy Perkins and Wallis fashion brands show mainly size 10-12 and Evans size 16. Original 'waif' Kate Moss pictured wearing skinny jeans and top from the fashion collection she designed for Topshop . Body image and confidence have been debated vigorously among those working in the fashion industry since the 'waif' look emerged. In 1997 US President Bill Clinton fired a broadside at the fashion industry for glamorising heroin use by using skinny girls with pale skin and limp arms to promote a 'heroin chic' look. But British industry insiders claim retailers are already working hard to promote body confidence by ensuring items are available in a wide range of sizes and offering advice on figure-flattering clothes both in-store and online.","Average dress size has grown from 12 to 16 in just over a decade .

"A university graduate today relived the terrifying moment he was stabbed repeatedly in the back by a 'joker' obsessed bodybuilder. Fuelled by voices of Batman’s joker, paranoid schizophrenic Dale Pipe attacked Joshua Henley with a filleting knife. He stabbed him repeatedly in the back and neck, after he was picked 'at random' in the gym changing area as he used a urinal. 'Dangerous': Dale Pipe (left), who was obsessed with Batman's arch nemesis the Joker, stabbed Joshua Henley (right) repeatedly in the back in a ferocious gym attack . Scarred: Joshua's ear was partially cut off. 'The knife broke my left shoulder in various places. It went straight through me,' he said today . Joshua, 22, today told of the moment, covered in blood, he managed to turn to face his attacker. 'We were just about nose to nose and I will never forget the look in his eyes,' he said. 'You wouldn’t see a look like that in anybody’s eyes in a film, or hopefully in real life, anywhere ever. 'I knew it was bad when I turned around and the blood was pouring out my neck. Pipe was obsessed with the Joker (pictured) and after stabbing Mr Henley posted: 'Why so serious?' on Facebook - a line from The Dark Knight . 'It was like an animal look in his eyes. He just wouldn’t take his eyes off mine.' The . 21-year-old attacker, who was armed with an axe and a selection of ten . other knives, struck at the Bellevue Leisure Centre in Consett, County . Durham. After he was . barricaded into a toilet cubicle he sent out a Facebook post saying 'Why . so serious?' - the catch phrase of the fictional hero’s nemesis and . identified himself as 'The Joker'. Yesterday . Pipe was sentenced to an indefinite hospital order at Newcastle Crown . Court after pleading guilty to attempted murder and having offensive . weapons. Joshua managed to fight off his attacker by head-butting him and then staggered into the gym reception area where he collapsed. 'If there was any point when I thought I was going to die that was it,' he said. I was basically fighting with an ear chopped off, 16 stab wounds and two broken shoulders.' Joshua had never met his attacker before and there were no words spoken prior to the sudden and unprovoked stabbing . The . graduate said: 'To make himself appear like the Joker, as far as I’m . concerned, is something that he failed in doing because he hasn’t . frightened me. 'I wanted to . see him in court to show him he’s not scared me at all. He might have . hurt me temporarily but I am on the road to being back where I was . before. 'My ear got partially cut off. The knife broke my left shoulder in various places. It went straight through me. 'It . went in my neck and out the back of my neck. I was stabbed in the arm. The wound was about eight inches long. I was stabbed in the left leg, . stabbed in the stomach, stabbed in the head and straight across where . your spine is and low down in the abdomen.

The Belle Vue Leisure centre, pictured, where Joshua Henley from Consett, County Durham was stabbed by bodybuilder Dale Pipe who has since been sentenced for his attempted murder. Joshua fled to the gym reception area . Pipe waited for an hour before choosing Joshua Henley to attack at Belle Vue Leisure Centre (pictured) 'I got stabbed in the face, which I didn’t realise till I got to hospital.' Joshua said he believes Pipe would have gone on to kill others that day had gym workers not stepped in to help. He . added: 'The only reason he backed off was because he had no . alternative. He couldn’t get out of my grip and other people would have . got involved at some point. He took the easy way out in my  opinion. 'I was losing blood left, right and centre, quite literally, it was pretty surreal.' High security: Judge James Goss detained Pipe indefinitely at Newcastle Crown Court yesterday . Only . Joshua’s developed muscle mass protected his vital organs from the . knife. When police later went to Pipe’s home more knives and a haul of . violent films were found. At . Newcastle Crown Court on Wednesday Judge James Goss QC sentenced Pipe, . of Thornfield Road, Consett, to an indefinite hospital order, calling . him a 'very dangerous young man'. The . court heard that Pipe, a former chef, has had auditory hallucinations . since the age of 14, the most influential of which was the joker. Whilst . in prison, Pipe, who has since been diagnosed with paranoid . schizophrenia, mutilated himself in the face, after the 'voice' persuaded him to carve a joker face into his own. Mr Henley spent six hours in surgery and 12 days in hospital after the attack.","Joshua Henley today told how he was stabbed repeatedly in the back .

"Father-of-two John Stoner, 42, dug up the extremely rare New England coin in a field outside the village of King's Clipstone in Nottinghamshire. When it was minted 350 years ago, there wouldn’t have been much change from a slap-up meal and a few of pints of ale. Today the silver threepenny coin that amateur treasure-hunter John Stoner dug up in a farmer’s field would probably buy the entire farm. The extremely rare New England coin, bearing the date 1652, is expected to sell for up to £1million when it is auctioned. It has been hailed as one of the finest examples of a currency produced in the days of the Pilgrim Fathers in a land that would become the United States. How the 17th century threepenny bit ended up in the village of King’s Clipstone, Nottinghamshire, is not known but last night coin collectors from around the world clamoured to buy it. Mr Stoner, who temporarily mislaid the coin at one point, found it while on an outing with the Coil To The Soil metal detector club on Sunday. The 42-year-old father of two had only just started to sweep an area of the ploughed field when he picked up two signals from the detector. The first was from a random piece of metal; the second was from an uneven, hand-hammered coin, about the size of a modern 1p but thinner, buried five inches deep in a clod of earth. ‘I dug up the soil and out it popped,’ he said of the historic find. ‘At first I didn’t think it was anything special. I knew it wasn’t English, but just how important a find it was, I didn’t have a clue.’ The club immediately posted a picture of the coin on its Facebook page and invited followers to identify it. Within five minutes, they were inundated with replies. One enthusiast wrote: ‘Your mate has just won the lottery!’ That evening Mr Stoner took it to his Worksop home, put it in a jar and showed it to friends. In the morning, he couldn’t find it. ‘I must have knocked the jar over,’ he said. ‘It rolled on the floor somewhere but I just left it there when I went out. I had to look around for it when I came back.’ On Monday, coin expert Peter Spencer confirmed it was a genuine threepenny piece from the first authorised colonial coinage, commissioned and struck in Boston, Massachusetts. ‘I handed it over to him and I think it’s fair to say he went white as a ghost,’ Mr Stoner said. ‘He said its condition was like the day it was struck.’ It was made by placing a blank silver disc on an engraved die, sandwiching it with another die for the reverse side, then hitting it with a hammer. The III in Roman numerals shows its denomination to differentiate it from tuppence, sixpence and shilling coins. Although it bears the date 1652, the oak tree on one side shows could have been minted in any year between 1653, when the original simpler design was changed to beat counterfeiters, and 1682, when a new series of coins was introduced. Scroll down for video . Historic find: The silver coin, bearing the date 1652, was unearthed by the metal detector enthusiast on Sunday . Although it bears the date 1652, the oak tree on one side shows could have been minted in any year between 1653 and 1682, when a new series of coins was introduced . Because it is a single coin, it is not subject to treasure trove laws which mean finds have to be reported to a coroner and handed to the Crown. Last night it was on its way to the US for expert cleaning before being offered for sale by St James’s Auctions in London on December 2. Five years ago a less spectacular colonial Massachussetts coin was sold for $430,000 (about £265,000). One US auction house estimated Mr Stoner’s could fetch $1.7million – just over £1million. Mr Spencer said the coin was ‘a phenomenal find’, not only because of its rarity but because it had survived undamaged. Some coins of that era were ‘short changed’ by filing or clipping silver from the edges to sell. He said it might have come to England as part of 17th century transatlantic trading. A good tradesman would earn about five shillings (25p) a week in those days – so threepence would have seen him fed in fine style. Not quite as fine as that which might await Mr Stoner, if the coin reaches its highest valuation. The self-employed IT consultant plans to split the proceeds with the farmer. ‘I think there’ll be enough to buy me some new clothes and pay a few bills,’ he said. In the era the threepenny bit was minted in Boston, England was undergoing one of the most turbulent periods in its history. More than 30 years earlier, the Pilgrim Fathers had fled religious persecution at home to found the first permanent colony in what became known as New England. The 102 pilgrims boarded the Mayflower in 1620 and crossed the Atlantic, settling in Plymouth, in modern-day Massachusetts, which would remain a separate colony until 1691. Groups of Puritans, and others seeking the freedom to worship as they chose denied them in England, formed neighbouring colonies, including Boston. The years after the Pilgrims’ departure were notoriously bloody in England, culminating with the Civil War, which broke out in 1642. In 1649 Charles I was tried and executed for treason and the monarchy was abolished. Oliver Cromwell declared a republic – the Commonwealth of England – and invaded Ireland and Scotland, slaughtering thousands to expand his power. Following his death in 1658, Charles II was restored as monarch. Back in the New World, while at first the colonists relied on help from the native American indians and each other, they gradually began to develop trade links with other lands – including England.","John Stoner, 42, dug up the the rare coin in a field in Nottinghamshire .

"Scotland Yard detectives investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have held an important meeting with Portuguese counterparts that they hope will lead to a major breakthrough in the case. Four Met Police officers met with senior members of Portugal’s detective squad, the Policia Judiciaria (PJ), in Faro, to urge them to carrying out inquiries identified by the British investigation known as Operation Grange. The detectives had arrived in the Algarve on Monday afternoon and held a three-hour meeting, starting at 10am yesterday. Investigation: British police officers arrive in downtown Faro, Portugal, carrying documents believed to be related to three men who may be connected with the disappearance of toddler Madeline McCann in 2007 . Abducted: Madeleine McCann was three when she vanished from her parents' apartment in Praia da Luz . Breakthrough: British officers met for three hours with Portuguese counterparts about new leads . Investigation: The officers met police in the city of Faro, whose jurisdiction includes the town of Praia de Luz . Wearing sunglasses and carrying suitcases full of documents, the officers arrived in Portugal on Monday . The Met officers held talks with the head of the PJ in Faro, Mota Carmo, and Ana Paula-Rita, the coordinator for the PJ office in Portimao, whose jurisdiction covers Praia da Luz, in the hope of gathering new evidence. British police want to interview three burglars who have been identified as prime suspects in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in May 2007. Analysis of mobile phone data suggests the men were ‘very close’ to the holiday apartment in Praia da Luz when the three-year-old vanished. It also indicates they made an unusually high number of calls to each other in the hours that followed her abduction in 2007. A source close to the PJ told the Daily Mail: ‘The British police came to Faro for a meeting at 10am. Chat: The four officers, pictured, are pushing closer to being able to arrest three 'prime suspects' Detectives: The officers had a morning meeting in Portugal before heading for lunch .

The Portuguese authorities reopened their own investigation into the youngster’s disappearance in October last year. Anguish: Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry with an image of how she may have looked in 2012 . Mystery: It is almost seven years since Madeleine McCann vanished in the holiday resort of Praia da Luz . Madeleine, who was then nearly four, disappeared from her family’s holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve on May 3, 2007, as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant with friends. It is now known that between January and May 2007 there had been a four-fold increase in the number of burglaries in the area. Police said in October last year that in the 17 days before she disappeared there was one burglary and one attempted burglary in the block where the McCann family were staying.","EXCLUSIVE: Scotland Yard officers hold three-hour meeting in city of Faro .

"It could have been a scene straight out of the ultra-violent video game. Minutes after the Grand Theft Auto V game went on sale yesterday, yobs mugged a fan who’d been one of the first to buy it — battering him over the head with a brick and knifing him in the back. The 23-year-old victim had queued for hours at a supermarket to buy the game and was on his way home when he was set upon by the teenage mob who demanded he hand it over. Scroll down for video . Crime scene: A police officer stands guard at the scene where a man was attacked and robbed after buying a copy of the latest Grand Theft Auto computer game . Investigation: The attack happened in Princes Avenue, Colindale, at around 1.20am yesterday following the release of the game at midnight . When he refused, the gang of five or six youngsters gave chase, stabbing him in the back twice with a kitchen knife, before throwing a brick at his head, which sent him crashing to the ground. The thugs ripped the computer game from his grasp and stole his mobile phone so he could not call for help. Yesterday, the unnamed man was recovering in hospital where he was said to be in a stable condition. Detectives believe the muggers . specifically targeted him after seeing crowds of fans queuing in the car . park of Asda superstore in Colindale,  North-West London. Attack: The 23-year-old was hit with a brick, stabbed and robbed after visiting the Asda store in Colindale, north London, to buy the latest Grand Theft Auto game . In stock: The game is pictured on display at the store hours after its release yesterday . Several stores across the country started selling the game at midnight as part of a worldwide release of the fifth in the blockbuster series to fans eager to get their hands on one of the most highly-anticipated games of all time. The attack happened just after 1am when the thugs followed their victim to a deserted street. It came as the makers of Grand Theft Auto faced fresh controversy over the new game’s gruesome torture scenes. Alison Sherratt, president of the . Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said she was worried about the . impact on children. She said: ‘Until now, we’ve been warning of the . dangers of children seeing these games, but saying it’s the parents . responsibility to keep children away from them. ‘But this scene takes things a step too far and the games makers need to consider what they are producing. Launch: The 23-year-old man (not pictured) had just bought a copy of the newly released Grand Theft Auto game at the Asda store in Colindale, north London . ‘Children in our playgrounds display more violence. My concern is that little brother or sister walks into the room and starts watching something like this because an older brother is playing it. ‘They don’t understand the difference between reality and fiction because it’s so graphic and real, and they do copy it. ‘They imitate what they see and this scene is taking it way too far.’ The Association of Teachers and Lecturers has carried out research suggesting video games are  increasing violence among primary school-aged children. Ms Sherratt added: ‘We’ve had children crashing into others in toy cars in the playground. When asked about it they say they’ve been watching Grand Theft Auto. They are quite open about it — children of nine and ten.’ Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the . Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘I am astonished at the level of . violence depicted in this game. ‘It . is worrying that this type of content could be accessed by young . people, particularly considering the previous links to real-life . violence. In demand: The 23-year-old victim was among hundreds of fans of the computer game to queue outside stores ahead of the midnight release. Customers are pictured outside Game in Westfield, Stratford . It's here: The long awaited game is expected to break sales records . Dedicated: Fans of the game queue outside a HMV store in Wimbledon in the early hours of Tuesday morning after the launch of the game . Big sales: Customers snap up the new game at the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford . Much anticipated: Queues are finally allowed to enter the Game store at Westfield in Stratford after a long wait for the game . Still queuing: Dedicated gamers queue out the door at a branch of Game in Glasgow for the highly anticipated game . Open all hours: Fans around the country queued as shops opened late to mark the game's launch . ‘It is important that the video game industry takes steps to inform the public about the level of extreme content. ‘Responsibility also lies with parents to ensure their children do not access these games until it is appropriate.’ A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'A 23-year-old man was shopping, then on his way back home he was hit with a brick and stabbed. 'He was robbed of items he had bought from a nearby Asda supermarket including a copy of Grand Theft Auto. 'We think he was attacked on Princes Avenue by multiple suspects although it is unclear how many at this stage.' The scene of the attack remained cordoned off today while police appealed for witnesses. Big business: The Grand Theft Auto series has accumulated sales of 135million copies since its 1997 debut . Money maker: The game, pictured advertised here in Los Angeles, is expected to generate sales of around £1billion in its first year on sale . The gunman who killed 12 people in a rampage through a Washington naval base was an obsessive player of violent video games, it emerged yesterday. Aaron Alexis, 34, indulged in all-night sessions playing ‘shoot ’em up’ games such as Call Of Duty and Resident Evil. The mentally disturbed killer’s gaming sessions would last up to 16 hours, according to former housemate Nutpisit Suthamtewakul. ‘He could be in the game all day and all night. I think games might be what pushed him that way,’ he said. There have been growing calls for research into links between violent games and real-life violence. The AR-15 assault rifle that Alexis used is also one of the weapons in Call Of Duty. The game was also played by the Norway mass killer Anders Breivik and by Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old who shot dead 26 children and staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Mr Suthamtewakul said Alexis fired a bullet through the wall of his room last year — but claimed it was an accident.","The 23-year-old man was attacked after leaving Asda in Colindale, London .

"Anger: Sarah Pike, 36, administered insulin to reduce her blood sugar level before tucking into her Big Mac - but was thrown out . A diabetic mum-of-two was ordered to leave a McDonald’s restaurant for injecting herself with insulin - after staff accused her of being on drugs. Sarah Pike, 36, ordered a Big Mac from the fast-food chain last Friday and administered insulin to reduce her blood sugar level before tucking into her meal. But when staff spotted her injecting herself they told her to leave the premises because they believed she was using hard drugs. Mrs Pike, of Banbury, Oxfordshire, said: 'This was probably the most humiliating experience of my life and something like this has never happened to me before. 'I was shocked. I am Type 1 so I need to use insulin before eating meals each day, and I kept saying the pen could not be tampered with but they wouldn’t believe me. 'There were children in the restaurant at the time and they do not understand diabetes and what it means to me.' Mrs Pike has now received an apology from McDonalds after she was booted out of the Bridge Street restaurant in Banbury. As a Type 1 diabetic, she has to inject herself with insulin four times a day and monitor what food she eats. She added: 'I have been diabetic for 13 years and I think there is a general misunderstanding of what the condition means. 'Some . friends were saying that I should have gone to the toilets or somewhere . private to do my injections but that isn’t the point.

"Former Deputy CIA Director Michael Morell bobbed and weaved his way through a contentious House Intelligence Committee hearing on Wednesday, parrying Republicans' suggestions that politics colored his decision to downplay the role of terrorism in the Benghazi, Libya attack that killed four Americans in 2012. 'None of our actions were the result of political influence. None,' Morell said, describing a chain of events that began with an armed assault on U.S. diplomatic stations and ended with then-UN Ambassador Susan Rice misleading five national television audiences about the nature of the attack. The CIA altered a series of talking points requested by senior Intelligence Committee members – meant to educate their newer colleagues – removing references to terrorism and casting the death and destruction as the product of a spontaneous protest. On Wednesday Morell complained openly about allegations that he acted 'for the political benefit of President Obama and then-Secretary of State [Hillary] Clinton. These allegations are false.' Morell has kept largely silent in the intervening 18 months, but left the CIA last year to join a Washington, D.C. consultancy with strong links to Mrs. Clinton, who ran the State Department when Libyan Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other personnel perished in the attack. Scroll down for video . Former Deputy CIA Director Michael Morell testified Wednesday about his role in altering talking points describing the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi, Libya . Republicans are angry about wholesale changes made to the CIA's official version of what happened in Benghazi -- changes that ignored the observations of the Libyan station chief who reported in with a terror-attack story . The episode, and Clinton's publicly dismissive responses to it, is seen as a potential albatross around her neck as she prepares for a presidential run that most observers see as inevitable. Beacon Global Strategies, Morell's employer, is a ten-person firm whose co-founders include Philippe Reines, a senior counselor to Mrs. Clinton when she ran the State Department. Reines is still her spokesman, serving in that capacity in what New York magazine calls 'a second full-time job.' 'And if she runs again – he claims he doesn’t know if she will – Reines will be onboard,' the magazine concluded in February. Meaning that Morell, as a senior official at Beacon, will also likely be part of the Clinton spin machine. A senior staffer to a Republican . House Intelligence Committee member told MailOnline after the morning . hearing concluded that 'a bunch of us are bothered by Morell's changing . stories, and by his use of Washington's revolving doors.' 'He would be a lot more believable if his paychecks weren't signed by Hillary Clinton's right-hand man,' the aide confided . Morell testified Wednesday that after a first draft of his agency's talking points about the Benghazi fiasco made the rounds inside the State Department, Clinton's agency was 'very upset about ... warning language' that was included. 'As a result,' he recalled, 'the talking points are in limbo. They're stuck.' Getting them unstuck, history shows, required the softening of language and the removal of all references to terrorist groups. 'We do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa'ida participated in the attack,' the first draft had read. Later versions described only an 'on-going' investigation to learn 'who is responsible for the violence.' Terror attack or 'demonstration'? The CIA edited its official version of events to scrub the former and emphasize the latter . US Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens was killed in the attack on US diplomatic facilities, along with three security personnel . The result, Morell said, was shared with the White House for 'final coordination.' He has testified previously, however, that there was no coordination at all. Morell defended the talking-point changes on Wednesday, saying that his chief of station's report – which leaned heavily on terrorism as a cause – 'was not compelling' enough to override the judgment of his own analysts. They had already determined, incorrectly, that armed protesters attacked American consular buildings after a demonstration spiraled out of control. Those decisions were based, in part, on press reports that appeared between the attack on Sept. 11 and the talking points discussions on Sept. 15. 'Let me make clear that we know that the analysts had an evidentiary basis to make the judgment that there was a protest ongoing at the time of the attack,' Morell testified. 'All together, there were roughly a dozen or so reports indicating that this was the case.' 'These included press accounts – including public statements by the Libyan Government and by extremists. And they included intelligence reports from CIA, the National Security Agency, and the Department of Defense.' When his station chief reported in to say something completely different, Morell saw his account as the outlier in an otherwise consistent picture, which later turned out to be wrong. In emails later uncovered by Congress, CIA Director David Petraeus called the resulting talking-point language 'useless.' That may not be true politically. The fixer: Long-time senior Hillary Clinton adviser Philippe Reines hired Michael Morell away from the CIA in a what some Republicans think was a move to keep him on a short leash . 'What difference does it make?': Former first lady and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton figures to be the Democratic Party's presidential candidate in 2016, if her stewardship of the Benghazi episode doesn't sink her . Good soldier: Morell is now employed by a firm whose co-founders include Hillary Clinton's chief gatekeeper and public spokesman . The issue has become a political gold mine for Republicans of all stripes, especially given Mrs. Clinton's fiery testimony in a now-infamous 2013 Senate hearing. Asked to explain the discrepancies between the Obama White House's post-Benghazi proclamations and the CIA's contemporaneous observations, she entered the annals of regrettable sound bites. 'Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they’d go kill some Americans?' Clinton asked with her arms outstretched. 'What difference – at this point, what difference does it make?' Michigan republican Rep. Mike Rogers, who chairs the committee, claimed the White House ultimately used the doctored talking points 'to perpetuate its own misguided political agenda.' 'The White House wants to ignore reality and perpetuate the fallacy that al-Qaeda and other Islamic extremists are on the verge of defeat,' he said. Meanwhile, Democratic stalwart Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois claimed there was a 'partisan smear campaign.' targeting the White House and Mrs. Clinton.","CIA station chief in Benghazi, Libya told CIA that the al-Qaeda-linked attack was not the product of a spontaneous protest .

"In the swing: John Simpson, 63, has become the first patient in the UK to wear the C-Brace - allowing him to walk naturally for the first time in 40 years . Not so long ago bionic limbs were the stuff of TV science fiction dramas. But these days attaching robotic parts to human arms and legs is so advanced that they can even be used to improve a game of golf. The first exoskeletal brace marketed for leisure activities yesterday went on sale in Britain. The £60,000 robotic support has been developed to help people with minor disabilities improve the way they walk or play sports. Called the C-Brace, the device was yesterday demonstrated at a golf club in London by a 63-year-old man who had suffered polio as a child. Designed to wrap around the lower leg, the machine can be used for walking, cycling or even roller blading. The different activities are selected on a remote control and transmitted to the leg via wireless Bluetooth technology, which then carries out the actions that are needed for that particular sport. The brace contains computers and sensors on the upper leg, sensing the movement of the muscles in the thigh and transferring them to the robotic knee support. It reduces strain in the joint and generates the power needed for movement, enabling people with minor movement disabilities - such as those experienced after a stroke - to employ a full range of actions. Bionic exoskeletons were developed over the last decade to rehabilitate people who had been paralysed. First used by the US army, the first bionic suits were used to manipulate the bodies of disabled soldiers in order to stimulate their muscles. They were remarkably successful, the computer-controlled suits replicating natural body motions and triggering the motor control people had lost in accidents or strokes. The technology has now become so widely available that it is now available on general sale for the first time. Perviously only available in hospitals as a rehabilitative tool, it is now cheap enough to offer to people to wear full time. Orthotic firm Ottobock’s C-Brace was launched in the US last year, and yesterday was placed on sale in Britain. The different activities are selected on a remote control and transmitted to the leg via wireless Bluetooth technology, which then carries out the actions that are needed for that particular sport . Former sports manager John Simpson, 63, from south-west London, who strapped on the device at Wimbledon Golf Club yesterday, said: ‘It’s going to change my life.’ Polio left Mr Simpson’s nerves so damaged as a child he was unable to walk and despite multiple operations, physiotherapy and treatments, he has relied on a locked-leg brace to help him move around since he was 14. He said: ‘For as long as I can remember, I’ve had to walk with a locked-knee, which is awkward, cumbersome and puts great strain on my lower back. ‘Over the years I tried new braces, supports and therapies, but nothing helped me walk and so I stuck with my original steel callipers. John Simpson, who suffered polio as a child, who strapped on the device at Wimbledon Golf Club yesterday, said 'it’s going to change my life' ‘The C-Brace is a revolution. I can walk naturally again, without fear that my leg will give way, leading to a fall. I can walk downstairs with a bent knee and without fear as the brace provides support intuitively.’ David Buchanan of Ottobock said: ‘This is the most exciting development in the orthotic industry in the last decade. ‘This is a device designed for people who don’t have the full control of their legs or can’t bear weight without collapsing. ‘It’s the first ‘swing-phase’ control orthosis, which means that the computer and sensors inside the device control the leg in space - just like the advanced prosthetic legs. ‘This means that it can help people walk, cycle... even play a round of golf, naturally and comfortably.’","The C-Brace wraps around  lower leg and can be used for various activities .

"A new app taking music listeners directly to the most dramatic part of the song has been released by Spotify. The Where is the Drama? app analyses songs' data to find the loudest crescendo, turning it into a 30-second sound clip. It was developed at a 'hack day' in Berlin by Paul Lamere, director of developer community for The Echo Nest, Spotify's music intelligence division. Where is the Drama? has found that the peak moment in Nirvana's hit Smells Like Teen Spirit comes after two minutes and 33 seconds . Nirvana's Kurt Cobain said they used a 'tension and release', quiet and loud formula for Smells Like Teen Spirit . Mr Lamere wanted to find out if a song's ability to strike a chord with a listener lies with its most dramatic section. Indie band The Pixies were renowned for their 'soft-loud' dynamic because of songs like Gigantic, which has a long, quieter period before a sudden crescendo. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain said The Pixies inspired the 'tension and release' formula for Smells Like Teen Spirit, and the same idea is used today by rock bands like the Foo Fighters and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. When downloaders use the app, it takes them directly to the most intense section of the song. As some Led Zeppelin fans will know, listeners face five minutes and 20 seconds at a slower before Stairway to Heaven roars into life. The app's analysis has confirmed this, while it has also found that the peak drama in Smells Like Teen Spirit comes after two minutes and 33 seconds. The 'loudness curve' shown on Where is the Drama demonstrates where the 'drop' in the music is - where the sound decreases before an explosion of sound. As some Led Zeppelin fans will know, listeners face five minutes and 20 seconds at a slower before Stairway to Heaven roars into life . Indie band The Pixies were renowned for their 'soft-loud' dynamic because of songs like Gigantic, which has a long, quieter period before a sudden crescendo . This technique is commonly used in drum and bass music, but the app shows it was common in rock songs of old. Creator of the Where is the Drama? app Paul Lamere explained how the app worked on his blog. The app grabs the detailed audio analysis for the song and finds the 30-second period where volume increases the most, he said. Extra weight is given to louder crescendos, so if two parts of a track increase in volume by 20 decibels, the louder of the two will be used for the sound clip. During the process of making the app, Mr Lamere realised that he would not be able to stop the track after the 30-second clip. Instead, the app automatically switches to silent song 4’33 by John Cage after any clip is played. Mr Lamere said: 'The idea of the app is to find the epic moment, the dramatic moment, in the music. 'The app breaks down the song, looking at the volume throughout and finds the most dramatic increases. 'It's been a very popular download. Some people have been using it to find the most dramatic parts of movie soundtracks. It's also popular for dubstep, but there's a whole range. 'This is definitely a novelty app. It's a tongue-in-cheek app that takes you straight to your favourite part of the song. He added that the app could be used in future to help musicians work out at what point listeners get bored with a song and move on. 'People often just mix songs as loud as they can to grab the listener's attention,' Mr Lamere told the Independent. 'The algorithm shows that music which has a diverse range of sounds and a wider use of dynamics sounds better.' 'Skipping straight to the dramatic bits is like a reader going to the final page of a mystery novel to find out who did it. 'The app is a bit of a novelty but people can see whether the computer agrees with you about where the best, most dramatic section of a song is.'","Spotify's Where is the Drama? app locates the loudest part of a song .

"Tom Daley is beginning 2015 with a new dive in his repertoire and full of optimism about his prospects of challenging for his sport's greatest prizes. The past 12 months or so have seen plenty of change for Daley, much of which has revolved around a switch in base and coach. He relocated from his native Plymouth to London, and his work there with Zimbabwe-born former University of Houston diving coach Jane Figueiredo has led to various adjustments in his training. Tom Daley poses on the podium with his 10m gold medal at the Glasgow Commonwealth games . Daley posted this picture on Instagram during his recent training block in Rio . Within that, the decision has been made to scrap what Daley had referred to as his 'demon dive' - the backwards two-and-a-half somersault with two-and-a-half twists routine in the piked position - and replace it with a new 'twister'. Described as a 'forward three-and-a-half somersaults with one twist pike', this effort has the same degree of difficulty as the old one, which had been causing Daley trouble for some time. And the 20-year-old, who claimed 10-metre platform bronze at the 2012 London Olympics, told Press Association Sport: 'I'm actually the first person in the world to perform that (new) dive - it will be a world first when I compete it at the British Championships (in Plymouth in February), which is really exciting. The 20-year-old posted this picture on his Instagram account during a training block in Rio . 'It has been done on springboard before, but never on 10-metre. 'It is a work in progress, but it is already working a lot better than my twister before. 'We had to do something that was going to make it so that my dives were the best they could possibly be, and in shape to try to challenge the Chinese, and we were never going to be able to do that with that old dive. 'This new dive has been able to change my mindset on things, and it will also be a lot better in that the judges are going to get fresh look at a brand new dive they haven't seen before. 'It is a risk, obviously, but you have to take risks if you want to win that medal.' Tom Daley, seen here practising a dive at the London 2012 Olympics, returns to competitive action next month . After the high of the Olympic medal he secured in London, 2009 10m platform world champion Daley initially struggled for motivation and with injuries, and could only manage sixth place at the 2013 World Championships in Rome. However, following his link-up with Figueiredo, he retained gold in the event at last summer's Glasgow Commonwealth Games before claiming silver at the 2014 European Championships in Berlin. He also publicly revealed around a year ago that he was in a relationship with a man - Hollywood screenwriter Dustin Lance Black. And with Daley declaring he has 'never been happier with diving and life', things appear to be coming together well as he continues to work towards the major showpieces ahead - this summer's World Championships in Kazan and the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. Daley has just completed a two-week training camp with his British Diving colleagues in Rio . Regarding the latter, Daley has just completed a two-week training camp with his British Diving colleagues in the Brazilian city. And he is grateful to have had the chance to spend some time at the Olympic venue. 'It is the first time I have been to South America, so the first time in Rio, and I have absolutely loved it,' Daley said. 'It was amazing walking into the pool for the first time - it really did feel like an Olympic pool and it got the heart going, for sure. 'It is really nice to come away from this camp being able to actually visualise me diving into the pool, and knowing what it looks like, what the water temperature is like, what the platform surface is like - that kind of stuff all helps.'","Olympic bronze medallist and 2009 world champion has moved to London .

"Five copper coins found in northern Australia could rewrite the country's history. The coins are thought to date back as early as the 900s and are believed to have originated in Africa. Written history of Australia only dates back to 1606, when Dutch explorers landed in the region, and researchers from Indiana University want to find out how the thousand-year-old copper coins ended up on the other side of the Indian Ocean six centuries earlier. Copper coins, thought to have originated in Africa and dating back as early as the 900s, were discovered on the Wessel Islands off the north coast of Australia in 1944. Researchers from Indiana University now want to find out how the coins got to Australia and their findings could suggest the country was found six centuries before British explorer Captain Cook arrived in 1770 . Aboriginal Australians are thought to have first arrived on the Australian mainland by boat from the Malay Archipelago between 40,000 and 60,000 years ago. However, the first known landing in Australia by Europeans was by Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon in 1606. Other Dutch navigators explored the western and southern coasts in the 17th century, and dubbed the continent 'New Holland.' In 1770, British explorer Captain James Cook explored the east coast of Australia. The British penal colony was then first established at Botany Bay in January 1788. During the following century, the British established other colonies on the continent. This reduced the number of indigenous Australians because of conflict with the colonists and new diseases bought over from Europe. Australia fought with the British during both world wars. Lead researcher, Australian scientist Ian McIntosh said the coins were first discovered by soldier Maurie Isenberg in 1944. Isenberg was stationed on the Wessel Islands - an uninhabited group of islands of the north coast of Australia - during World War II and he found the coins buried beneath the sand. In 1979, Isenberg sent the coins to an Australian museum and now McIntosh wants to investigate how they arrived on the island. Isenberg also marked the location the coins were found on a map using an 'X'. At the same time, Isenberg found four coins that came from the Dutch East India . Company, dating back to 1690. This discovery supports claims that . Dutch explorers discovered the island before Captain James Cook in 1770. Australian scientist and professor at Indiana University, Ian McIntosh, points to the location where the copper coins were found . McIntosh and his team are arranging an expedition to the region in July. The coins are thought to be of African descent and originated from the former Kilwa sultanate. Kilwa used to a trade port and had links to India in the 13th to 16th century. The region is now a World Heritage ruin on an island off Tanzania. The . copper coins were the first coins to ever be produced in sub-Saharan . Africa and they have only been found outside of Africa twice. Once in Oman at the start of the century, and again by Isenberg in 1944. The coins were found on a beach on the Wessel Islands. The islands, pictured here at marker A, are off the coast of the Northern Territory of Australia. They were a key strategic position during the Second World War . The copper coins found off the north coast of Australia are said to have originated from Kilwa, a former sultanate island near modern-day Tanzania in Africa . It was originally thought that Dutch explorers first 'discovered' Australia in the 1600s. In 1770, British explorer, Captain James Cook was the first European to explore the eastern coast of Australia and claimed the country for the British throne. McIntosh believes that the coins may indicate that there were maritime trading routes connecting east Africa, Arabia, India and the Spice Islands over 1,000 years ago - much earlier than first thought. If this theory is proved correct it will mean that other civilisations discovered and made contact with Australia six centuries before the Europeans. This could mean the history of Australia needs to be rewritten. Another theory suggests that the coins may have been washed ashore the Wessel Islands following a shipwreck. McIntosh's expedition in July may help scientists and archaeologists discover how the coins arrived in Australia. He will revisit the location marked with an 'X' on Isenberg's map, as well as look for a secret Aboriginal cave. The cave is said to be near Isenberg's beach and is thought to be filled with other treasures.","Coins found date back as early as the 900s - six centuries before Captain Cook claimed the island for the British throne in 1770 .

"It was once a bustling presence in the heart of the city, but now Derbyshire Royal Infirmary stands crumbling and empty; quite literally a shell of its former self. These are the eerie photographs of the abandoned hospital, which was first built in 1810 and suffered a typhoid outbreak in 1890. The building's design was blamed for the incident and led to it being restructured over the following three years. In 1894 Queen Victoria laid the foundation stone of the new layout which featured 'onion' shaped towers to prevent the deadly disease coming back. The majority of the infirmary eventually closed to the public in 2009, with accident and emergency one of the first departments to move over the nearby Royal Derby Hospital - the second largest hospital in the East Midlands. Only a small NHS walk-in clinic known as London Road Community Hospital now functions on the site. The majority of the sprawling Derbyshire Royal Infirmary building now lies empty, with hospital beds and commodes scattered across corridors, and sinister dolls with their faces removed sitting in the visiting quarters.

The infirmary eventually closed in 2009, with accident and emergency one of the first departments to move over the nearby Royal Derby Hospital . Unused: The lifts have not been in working order since the last members of staff vacated the building several years ago . Plans: An old floorplan of Derbyshire Royal Infirmary was found inside the building. There is some discussion that the site may be redeveloped over the coming years . Typhoid fever is a bacterial disease transmitted by the ingestion of food or water contaminated with the feces of an infected person. Without prompt treatment, it can cause serious complications and can be fatal. It is caused by a bacterium called Salmonella typhi, which is related to the bacteria that cause salmonella food poisoning. The impact of this disease fell sharply in the developed world with the application of 20th-century sanitation techniques, but in Victorian Britain it was a illness that killed millions. The symptoms of typhoid fever are divided into four stages, each lasting approximately a week, with the patient becoming increasingly exhausted and emaciated. The first stage is flu-like symptoms, including high temperature, headache, cough and cramps, moving on to a feverish delirium and a rash on the abdomen in the second week. By the third week the disease can cause abscesses, severe dehydration, increased delirium and intestinal bleeding, but by the fourth week the fever gradually subsides and symptoms lessen. The most notorious carrier of typhoid fever—but by no means the most destructive—was Mary Mallon, also known as Typhoid Mary. In 1907, she became the first American carrier to be identified and traced. She was a cook in New York. She is closely associated with fifty-three cases and three deaths. Public health authorities told Mary to give up working as a cook or have her gall bladder removed. Mary quit her job but returned later under a false name. She was detained and quarantined after another typhoid outbreak. She died of pneumonia after 26 years in quarantine. Because of the way the infection is spread, typhoid fever is most common in parts of the world that have poor levels of sanitation and limited access to clean water. Typhoid fever is uncommon in the UK, with an estimated 500 cases occurring each year. Most of these people are thought to have developed the infection while visiting relatives in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.","Derbyshire Royal Infirmary once suffered a typhoid outbreak, with the building design blamed for the outbreak .

"Some people just want to get eaten. A huge Brazilian anaconda was captured in jaw-dropping video while a trio of fishermen pulled it out of the river water — nearly getting the animal stressed to the point of rearing its enormous head and swallowing them all. The group — Sirlei Oliveira, husband Betinho Borges and friend Rodrigo Santos — were boating down the Santa Maria river, in the southwestern state of Mato Grosso do Sul, when they came across the huge snake, reported O Correio News reported. The serpent, estimated to be at least 17 feet, is seen moving away from the tiny boat, its belly appearing full of what must have been a massive lunch not long earlier. Then Borges begins to prod the anaconda with a wooden oar as the snake attempts to get away from him. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A Brazilian fisherman is seen in this video pulling an anaconda at least 17 feet long from its hiding pace . The snake thrashes around trying to get away from the man . 'Leave it! Oh my god!' yells a hysterical Oliveira in Portuguese as her husband continues to torment the yellow anaconda.

'Grab it, dude, grab it!' instigate Borges as his buddy Santos tries to catch the snake by its tail. Then . Borges gets over to the boat control — and brazenly begins to take off as Santos holds on to the snake, pulling the huge animal as . it thrashes around trying to get away.

They . have also been charged with a crime and face up to a year and a half in . jail if they're convicted under an environmental law that proscribes . the chasing or hunting of wildlife without a license, according to O . Correio. The anaconda can be seen trying to hide as one of the men pull it by its tail . The couple's lawyer, Amilton Ferreira de Almeida, claimed there was 'no crime committed.' 'The video shows they didn't intend on committing a crime,' the lawyer told O Correio about couple's footage, which was posted to Facebook on Tuesday. 'For it to be a crime, they must have been intent. 'They wanted to show how nature is, how the animal behaves — but they had no malice,' the lawyer adds. 'There was guilt, yes, negligence and recklessness, but not intent.' But for Major Edmilson Queiroz, of the state's environmental police, being ignorant of the law isn't an excuse. 'The animal's place is to be quiet in nature, and a man's place is to be quiet in his corner, each one playing their role in nature,' Queiroz told O Correio. 'Don't expose the animals to this as if it's a good thing,' he said of the publicity the video has gotten. 'This attitude is unnecessary — to try to promote yourself at the expense of the animal.

"Limited edition holiday drinks have become a festive tradition and with new additions from Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts, it looks like the trend is set to continue for years to come. But, as FEMAIL can reveal, many of the tasty treats currently on offer at your favorite coffee chains contain seriously unhealthy levels of fat and sugar. One festive beverage, a large Eggnogg Latte from Peet's Coffee and Tea, contains a whopping 700 calories, more than one third of your recommended daily intake. Even a small cup of the calorific beverage, which is made with a special 'eggnog milk', contains 450 calories, more than most of the other coffee chain's large portions. Scroll down for video . The sweetest treat of them all: Peet's large Eggnog Latte contains a whopping 700 calories, however the company's large Cinnamon Hazelnut Latte (pictured) offers a more modest 385 . It's nearly here! Starbucks announced the arrival of the Chestnut Praline Latte (pictured) - its first new holiday drink in five years - last month but are making customers wait until November 12 to try it . Thankfully, it seems the full fat offering is the only one of its kind on the menu; the company's other popular holiday drink, the Cinnamon Hazelnut Latte, offers a relatively modest helping of calories, with a small cup containing just 240. Then there are Starbucks' festive selections. Last month the coffee chain chain announced that it would be launching the Chestnut Praline Latte, the first new addition to its holiday menu in five years, which is due to arrive in stores on November 12. According to Bloomberg, the hotly-anticipated drink took nearly three years to create, with Starbucks eager to ensure the perfect blend of espresso, steamed milk, caramelized chestnut flavor, spices - and a rather unhealthy helping of sugar. A few lucky customers had the opportunity to test the drink when Starbucks released it on trial in a few select locations in November last year and the majority were thrilled with the results. 'Trying out the new Chesnut Praline flavor...and it's a winner!' one person posted on Instagram, while another added: 'Holy moly, the #Starbucks chestnut praline latte may be my new favorite holiday beverage!' A Starbucks spokesperson told FoxNews.com that the new drink is 'inspired by the time-honored holiday tradition of warm roasted chestnuts… with freshly steamed milk and flavors of caramelized chestnuts and spices'.

"Lea-Ann Ellison, the Los Angeles fitness enthusiast who triggered outrage last September when she posted photos of herself on Facebook lifting heavy weights just two weeks before her due date, has once again hit back at her 'haters'. The 35-year-old mother of three, who gave birth to her youngest son four months ago, is back in the gym and says she, and little Skyler, are doing 'great'. 'I started back at CrossFit three weeks after my son was born,' she tells MailOnline. 'I did not go very hard as my body was still healing but I was so happy to be back to my program.' No mommy tummy here! LA native Lea-Ann Ellison hits back at critics of her exercise regime and displays her post-baby body a mere four months after the birth to little Skyler, pictured . The trim blonde proudly reveals her post-baby body in a new series of photos with son Skyler, and there's not a hint of a mommy tummy to be seen. 'I know, for me, that keeping strong and fit during pregnancy, and eating a diet full of fresh organic food has been key to my success in gaining my figure back,' she remarks. 'And no sugar! Sugar will keep a mommy tummy on a lady forever!' According to MuscleTech.com, CrossFit entails 'an aggressive yet well-rounded pursuit of general, overall fitness in the ten recognized domains, as opposed to the bodybuilding ideology of pursuing perfect muscle symmetry, size and cuts.' Ms Ellinson sparked controversy when photos emerged of her lifting what appear to be heavy weights while eight months pregnant . Ms Ellison says that when she fell pregnant, she received the go-ahead to continue with her workout 'immediately' from her health providers. 'This is something I have been doing for many years and to discontinue would have been a disservice to my body and my unborn baby,' she explains. In response to harsh critics commenting on a TMZ article yesterday, the fitness queen took to her Facebook fan page, writing: 'I hope to inspire other ladies to be healthy and fit while pregnant and after. If you don't like it, sit your ass on a couch and eat a donut.' Picture of health: The CrossFit fanatic credits her regime, coupled with a healthy organic diet and no sugar, with helping her snap back into shape so quickly . She continued by revealing that she now works out twice a week, without a trainer so she can spend more time with her kids, and that: 'What seems dangerous and impossible for some is a walk in the park for others'. But some were less than complimentary of Ms Ellison's approach. 'While what she did may not have harmed HER unborn child, it was completely unnecessary, with unpredictable results,' wrote one commenter. 'Going to this extreme sends the wrong message to expecting mothers,' mused another. Back in the game: Ms Ellinson says she hopes to 'inspire other ladies to be healthy and fit while pregnant and after' Ms Ellinson claims that the negative comments have 'no effect' on her at all. 'For a self confident person like myself it's like dust in the wind,' she remarks, adding that she simply feels 'sad' for individuals who aren't educated on the matter. And to her credit, she does seem to have more fans than critics. Many who responded to the TMZ story mentioned that that the new mother looked 'great' and was an 'inspiration.' 'I can't believe we're at the point of attacking people who strive for a healthier life for themselves as well as their children,' mused one. Baby weight! The keen mother ups the intensity of her walking lunges by strapping her adorable 13lb baby son to her chest . Another argued that people had chosen the wrong target to bash, writing: 'Why aren't we focusing more on moms who do drugs and other detrimental things?' Ms Ellison, who has declared she wants to be a 'Hot Mom', gave birth to Skyler last November in her home using a birthing pool, with no pain medication at all. 'I think what a woman's body is capable of is extraordinary and I choose to be present and in control for the whole process by not using drugs,' she explains, admitting that she has 'always loved the birth process' and, miraculously, doesn't find it difficult 'at all'. Tender moment: Skyler was born at home at in a birthing pool, with no pain medication and his mother claims to 'love the process' The tough cookie says she that kept exercising right up until she gave birth. 'Five days before Skyler was born, I completed 40 pull ups without assistance!' she reveals, adding that she did have to decrease her weights and 'scale back' on some aspects of her workout. The feisty mother regularly takes to her Facebook page to document her fearless regimen. 'No excuses! 400 meters of walking lunges is no joke. Then strap on a 13 pound baby. Holy mother,' she posted in January, almost two months from the day since giving birth. Ms Ellison first made headlines back in September when she posted a series of bold photos in which she is appears to be straining to pick up a heavy weight bar and lifting dumbbells above her head, all whilst sporting a huge pregnancy bump. What critics? Ms Ellington receives fan mail every day from woman who admire her approach . While many supported her decision to maintain her strenuous fitness regime, others were horrified. 'She is very selfish for endangering a life for her own personal gains and achievements. This is not a proud picture to post,' one respondent posted, as others labeled the photos 'sickening' and 'worrying'. Andrea Nitz, a personal trainer at CrossFit Brand X, in Ramona, California has published an article for the The Crossfit Journal, addressing the question of whether the regime is safe for expectant mothers. 'As many studies have shown, it’s not bad for our babies. It is actually very good for the kid,' Ms Nitz writes. She goes on to speak from personal experience, writing: 'I have seen for myself that babies born to CrossFitting moms have a number of similar traits that make for a smoother transition to life outside the womb.' And she may be right, if Ms Ellison's photos of her healthy-looking, bouncing baby boy are anything to go by. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists however, warns against undertaking strenuous exercise during pregnancy, saying: 'It has been reported that pregnant women whose occupations require repetitive, strenuous, physical work (e.g. lifting) have a tendency to deliver earlier and have small-for-gestational-age infant.' Most medical guidelines fall somewhere in between on their advice. The Mayo Clinic warns that although a woman's 'tolerance to strenuous exercise will decrease' as the pregnancy progresses, it's perfectly safe in most cases. 'Regular exercise can help you stay in . shape, better cope with the physical changes of pregnancy and build . stamina for the challenges ahead' In fact, according to a study last year from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly one in four women in the U.S. are obese when they become pregnant, and the ill effects of this can be far more potentially dangerous to an unborn child. Complications for an obese expectant mother may include high blood pressure, gestational diabetes and potential extra difficulties during labor and birth. 'Regular exercise can help you stay in shape, better cope with the physical changes of pregnancy and build stamina for the challenges ahead,' the Mayo Clinic states. For Ms Ellinson, it's been a rewarding journey and she's thrilled to have picked up many fans and new friends along the way. 'I receive fan mail every day from women saying thank you for leading the way. It has been very wonderful to see such a positive result of such an unexpected popularity,' she concludes.",Lea-Ann Ellison is keen fan of 'aggressive but well-rounded' CrossFit regime which involves weights and heavy lifting .
"She was just 15 years old when her brother's plane went down off the coast of Broome, Western Australia during World War II. But this week, Val Bullied, who is now 85, received the closure her family had been desperately searching for, for almost 70 years. On September 14, 1944, Sergeants Ronald Kerrigan from North Perth and Ronald Smith from Strathfield in NSW went missing in action when their plane crashed into the ocean off Cable Beach. Sergeants Ronald Smith (left) and Ronald Kerrigan (right) were both declared missing in action when their plane went down off the West Australian coast during WW2 . Then, two years ago local historian Dion Marinis and helicopter pilot Jim Miles began the long and involved search for the RAAF Beaufighter A19-163. On Sunday, after the discovery of the second engine from the plane, the two men were able to confirm that the wreckage was in fact exactly what they had been searching for. 'Finding the engines was the big finale of the two year search,' said Mr Miles, a helicopter pilot and part-time professional diver told the MailOnline. 'You sort of have mixed feelings, it's very emotional,' Mrs Bullied said. She said she was very grateful to the pair and is glad to have closure - despite the heartbreaking fact that no other family members who knew her brother are still with her to share in the joy. The 85-year-old told of how her family always knew where the plane went down, but no one thought to look for it until now. Dion Marinis and Jim Miles, who spent two years searching for part of the wreck, concluded their search on Sunday . The Beaufighter A19-163 went down in the early hours of September 14, 1944 . 'We were told where it was. I was very excited when they found it.' 'When they dive they're putting themselves at risk,' she said, speaking of the huge effort Mr Marinis and Mr Miles have put into discovering the wreckage. Mr Marinis is Vice President of the Broome Historical Museum, and said he has always had a 'passion' for WWII. However, this particular search was different, and he told of how important the discovery was for the local community. 'I was mainly driven personally for the family and for the history of Broome,' he said. 'It's been an amazing journey and it's been quiet humbling to be able to find the wreckage.' 'It was very exciting, even though at times it can be very harrowing.' Mr Miles echoed his sentiments, and said it was very difficult to describe the feeling of finishing the puzzle. 'It's a very moving moment when you finally put all the pieces together, it's a bit hard to explain.' The site off Cable Beach, WA, where the aircraft was discovered will now be protected under maritime law . This photo was taken of Ronald Smith (left) and Ronald Kerrigan (right) was taken only months before their plan crashed . The search was a very long and difficult process using a combination of sidescan sonar, metal detection and diving, kick-started by the simple spotting of an article in the local paper. 'I found a snippet in the paper that just said a fighter lost off the coast of Broome,' Mr Marinis said. From there, the two men teamed up and spent years scanning and surveying the area with their own equipment, an extremely difficult task given the plane went down in a rock field. This coming September a memorial will be held in honour of the pilot and navigator who lost their lives in the crash, and Mrs Bullied said she will travel the long distance from her home in Perth to attend. After the discovery of this wreck, The two men have many more sites in their sights . The site will become a protected area under maritime law, and the men now have their sights set on making more discoveries in the future. A helicopter pilot and profession diver part-time, Mr Miles said all though the mystery of this particular wreck is wrapped up, he has many more on his plate. 'There are 20 more wrecks that I want to locate, they're all over the world.' The various wrecks lie in locations all around Australia, New Zealand and New Guinea.","On September 14, 1944 Beaufighter A19-163 crashed off the coast of Broome, Western Australia .

"The parents of Wales international centre Owen Williams have arrived in Singapore to be with their son after he suffered a serious injury. Williams was hurt while playing for Cardiff Blues in the inaugural World Club 10s tournament two days ago. No details of Williams' condition have so far been released, but he is understood to have suffered a neck injury. In full flight: Cardiff Blues centre Owen Williams avoids a tackle during the LV Cup match against Bath in January . Messages of support have poured in for the 22-year-old on social media from international team-mates like Alex Cuthbert, Jamie Roberts, George North, Dan Lydiate, Ken Owens and Josh Turnbull, in addition to Australia back-row star David Pocock. Gloucester Rugby Club, Leinster, the Scarlets and Newport Gwent Dragons have also expressed support on Twitter for Williams, in addition to Cardiff City Football Club under the hashtag #StayStrongForOws. International: Williams makes a strong run during Wales' friendly against Japan in Tokyo last summer . While the Blues squad has now returned home, Williams' playing colleague Macauley Cook has remained with him in a Singapore hospital, alongside two members of the Blues' back-room staff, Press Association Sport understands. Williams was injured in a third and fourth place play-off game between the Blues and Asia Pacific Dragons, which took place at Singapore National Stadium. The Blues issued an initial statement on Monday, in which they thanked fans for their support of Williams, but there has since been no further comment. Powerful: The centre bursts past the challenge of two Japan players during another friendly in June last year . Williams has won four Wales caps, making his debut during last year's tour to Japan and then scoring a try in a 17-7 Millennium Stadium victory over Tonga seven months ago. Williams has also represented Wales at under-20 level and on the international world sevens circuit, while he joined the Blues' senior set-up after progressing through the region's academy system. His former club Aberdare, meanwhile, have postponed a presentation event that was planned for next Saturday to recognise ex-Aberdare players who achieved international honours.","Williams was injured while playing in inaugural World Club 10s tournament .

"Ban: Jeremy Irons is leading a campaign to stop HGVs from using his home town as a rat-run . He is a passionate campaigner on green issues, and now Jeremy Irons has backed a campaign to ban lorries from the quaint Oxfordshire town where he lives. The Oscar–winning actor has thrown his weight behind an action group to prevent HGVs using the narrow streets of Watlington as a rat-run between the M40 and M4. The market town - reputedly the smallest in the country - is regularly snarled up with lorries whose drivers, looking for a shortcut between Oxford and Reading, are directed there by their satnavs. Watlington Against Pollution and HGVs plans to put pressure on local councils to take action against the out-of-place vehicles. Irons, 65, star of Brideshead Revisited, lives in the picturesque town with his wife, Sinead Cusack, which has been used as the backdrop for ITV crime drama, Midsomer Murders. Nestled between the Vale of Oxford and the steep slopes of the Chilterns, records show it was once the site of a Saxon settlement in the 8th century. But Bronze Age axe and Roman coins have also been excavated, suggesting it has a much earlier past. Keith Lovelace, the group's chairman, said: 'Jeremy Irons is a resident of Watlington and he feels strongly about it so it makes sense for him to be part of it. 'We all know that if there is a celebrity behind a cause then it gets better publicity. 'We have a lot of people behind us and we are determined to succeed.' An air pollution report conducted earlier . this year found that readings were similar to those recorded in the . London borough of Lewisham. Unsuitable: The narrow streets of the ancient market town regularly become snarled up with HGVs . Rat-run: HGVs, directed by satnavs, take the shortcut between the M4 near Reading and the M40 . This was due to the number of large vehicles and the tall buildings in narrow streets acting like a canyon affect, trapping it low to the ground. Irons, who won the Oscar for Best Actor in 1991 for his portrayal of the fictional character Claus von Bülow in the Hollywood blockbuster, Reversal of Fortune, agreed to become patron after being made aware of the pressure group by his personal assistant, who was already a member. Mr Lovelace said they understood the need for lorries to supply businesses and deliveries to homeowners, and the group is targeting passing HGVs. One measure being looked at is to introduce a congestion charge scheme.","The revered actor is leading Watlington Against Pollution and HGVs .

"From lavishly decorated rooms to a stuffed jaguar and table football, the private life of a dictator has been laid bare by this extraordinary series of pictures. Taken from inside the former presidential palace of deposed Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, the photographs show some of the former dictator's everyday enjoyments, as well as some of this more extravagent expenditures. The palace, in Sidi Dhrif, in a seafront suburb of capital city Tunis, has been left virtually untouched since Ben Ali and his family fled in January 2011 in the face of the first of the Arab Spring uprisings. The luxurious interior of the former presidential palace of depiosed Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali . A stuffed jaguar stands as part of the decoration inside the palace in a seafront suburb of capital city, Tunis . A child's play area in the palace, believed to have been used by the former president's  son and heir, Mohamed. The pictures offer revealing insights into the life of Ben Ali, who now lives in exile in Saudi Arabia with his wife, and how he spent his time with his young family. While among the items they left behind include family portraits, statues and expensive-looking marble carvings, there also rests children's toys and DVDs of blockbuster films, untouched since the family fled. The former Tunisian presidency was toppled in the first of the Arab Springs after having been in power for 23 years. The country then voted in its first election since the uprising in October 2011, which led to the appointment of the Ennahda Movement, a moderate Islamist party in Tunisia, which nominated Hamadi Jebali to be prime minister. Mr Jebali today kicked off viewing for an auction of thousands of luxury items once owned by ousted dictator Ben Ali and his family. Jebali inspected 40 luxury cars, thousands of clothing, jewellery items and art works on the eve of the public auction which is being held in the Tunis suburb of Gammarth in a bid to raise millions of euros for government coffers. Highlight of the month-long sale is . expected to be the cars, which include a Lamborghini Gallardo LP 460, a . Bentley Continental sports car, an armoured Cadillac and a Maybach . About 42,000 items have been confiscated by the state from the palace, which was home to statues including the one pictured above left, in the living, room, while two degree certificates were left hanging in Ben Ali's personal study . Among the luxurious items were more everyday objects, such as this DVD of the Hollywood blockbuster Mr & Mrs Smith, starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie . In front of a row of marble carvings stands this table football set, showing the sometimes bizarre clash of cultures . The palace itself towers over the sea on a Sidi Bou Said hill, and includes all the hallmarks of a luxurious lifestyle, including vaulted ceilings, a seaside helicopter landing pad, a grandiose pool, two antique cannons, and a chandelier in nearly every room. Journalist Youssef Gaigi had never seen images of the palace before visiting it to report on the state auction of the former dictator's confiscated belongings. He told CNN: 'It was full of extravagance and extreme luxury and bad taste. 'All these signs of power... Nobody . could afford to have such things in Tunisia, unless they were the . president -- and not just any president, but a dictator.'

"Teenager Richard Fellows drowned after getting into difficulty while swimming at a busy beauty spot . Tributes have been paid to a teenage boy who drowned after getting into difficulty while swimming at a busy beauty spot with friends on one of the sunniest days of the year. Richard Fellows, 15, was pulled from the water by rescue crews at Arrow Valley Countryside Centre, in Redditch, Worcestershire, yesterday following a two-hour search effort. Friends desperately tried to help the teenager while the park was full of people on one of the sunniest days of the year so far. One boy, who asked not to be identified, said: 'My brother was with Richard in the water. Richard got into trouble and the others went to try and help him, but they couldn't.' Emergency services managed to pull Richard from the water, and performed emergency resuscitation, but he was pronounced dead when he arrived at Alexandra Hospital, Redditch. Ambulance staff also treated two other teenage boys who were recovered from the water. Charlie Rogers, 18, Richard's former neighbour and classmate at Trinity High School said: 'We just can't believe what's happened. It doesn't seem real. 'Richard had a lovely personality. You'd only have to look at him and he'd make you laugh. It's so unreal that he's gone.' Within hours, almost 1,500 people had joined a Facebook group set up in memory of Richard, who was a part-time shelf stacker at Tesco. The family of Richard Fellows have been down to the river where he died today in order to lay flowers .

The authorities also sent the ambulance service's hazardous area response team. Wearing wet suits, they joined other emergency services in a two-hour search of the lake's waters. The teenager was eventually located and brought ashore where medics started resuscitation and advance life support, according to the ambulance service spokesman. An ambulance with a doctor on board then took the teenager to Redditch's Alexandra Hospital, which had been pre-alerted to his serious condition. A spokesperson from West Midlands Ambulance service said: 'Three teenage boys were reportedly in difficulty in a lake at the park and a call was made to the emergency services at approximately 12.20pm. 'An ambulance crew, together with a . responder paramedic; the Hazardous Area Response Team; MERIT and . Midlands Air Ambulance from Cosford were sent to the scene.

A combined response unit of police, fire and ambulance services, including a Midlands Air Ambulance helicopter, attended the scene after they received the call at around 12.20pm . 'While the investigation is at a very early stage, it was a beautiful spring day and it appears the boys went into part of the river which forms a pool by the weir for a swim. 'Unfortunately the water there is deep and cold, and Richard did not resurface. 'I cannot reiterate strongly enough that swimming in a warm indoor pool is very different to swimming in open water, and even the strongest of swimmers can get into difficulty in rivers, canals, ponds, and quarries. 'Aside from the water being cold and deep, there may be strong currents, and submerged objects can also pose problems. 'Please, do not swim in open water, no matter how hot the weather. It is incredibly dangerous.'","Tributes have been paid to Richard Fellows, 15, who died while swimming .

"A set of parents have been banned from naming their son Wikileaks by a registry office, for fear that it could endanger the child's welfare. Hajar Hamalaw, 28, from southern Germany, originally from Iraq, wanted to name his newborn child after the online whistle-blowing platform because of his admiration for the site. However, authorities in Passau, Bavaria vetoed his choice of name, and have banned him from legally naming his son after the site. Newborn Dako, who narrowly avoided being called 'Wikileaks' after a Bavarian registry office vetoed the parents first choice . Mr Hamalaw said he wanted to name his son 'Wikileaks' because he believed it had 'changed the world'. Hajar Hamalaw wanted to name his son after the website because he felt the site had been an inspiration to him and his work as a journalist . Mr Hamalaw, a journalist who has lived in Passau for the last eight months, has made no secret of his adoration for the cables website. He said: 'The Wikileak revelations caused a great stir worldwide. 'Especially the ones about Iraq, where we come from.' But because of the Bavarian registry authority, Wikileaks did not make it onto the birth certificate. Mr Hamalaw said: ""The registrar said that this was not a first name. 'He thought it was a series or TV show.' A spokesperson for the town of Passau said the decision by the registry office was based on legal rulings. The rulings state a child’s name should not be granted if it could endanger their welfare. Eventually, Hamalaw named his son Dako on the birth certificate instead, according to the Passauer Neue Presse.

"When men attempt a spot of DIY around the house, it can often go disastrously wrong. But rarely does it go quite as badly as it did for builder Alan Williams. The 46-year-old was at his home in Market Drayton, Shropshire, when he slipped at the top of the stairs and accidentally fired a five-inch nail through his left hand. Gruesome: Alan Williams was doing some DIY at his home when he slipped at the top of the stairs and accidentally fired a five-inch nail through his left hand. This picture was taken when Mr Williams was at hospital being treated for his injury . Grim: Mr Williams was left nailed to the floor for nearly four hours unable to move or get help until his partner got home from work. This image shows him in hospital with the floorboard still attached to him . Mr Williams was left nailed to the floor for nearly four hours unable to move or get help. It was only when his partner and staff nurse Suzanne Amos got home from work at around 11pm that he was found - shivering and going into shock. Miss Amos had been expecting a cup of tea and her dinner after finishing her shift but instead found herself dialling 999 to get help. Mr Williams said: 'I slipped at the top of the stairs and put my left hand down, and then the nail gun in my right hand went onto it - bang. 'I was pinned to the floor, I couldn’t move, but actually there wasn’t much blood and I wasn’t in pain. 'After three hours though my leg was starting to go numb and I was very cold, I was grateful when Suzanne walked through the door.' Lucky: Incredibly, the high-powered bolt went right through Mr Williams' hand but missed vital tendons and veins. He is pictured here next to the floorboard which he became attached too . As these pictures show, the high-powered bolt had gone right through Mr Williams' hand but amazingly it missed vital tendons and veins. The fire brigade had to lift off the whole floorboard to take him to the City General hospital in Newcastle-Under-Lyme. After just one hour in theatre, Mr Williams was freed from the nail. He said: 'The fire chief said he hadn’t seen anything like it in 40 years, I ended up having to go to hospital with a floorboard attached to my hand. 'When I got to hospital the doctors weren’t sure if they should push or pull it out, I had to go into theatre for an hour for them to remove the nail. 'The doctors said I was very lucky I hadn’t hit a nerve or any of the circulatory system.' Miss Amos - who admits the DIY to the couple’s home was her idea - said: 'He was very cold when I got home, he usually has my dinner and a cup of tea ready for me and I was later back than usual because we’d been dealing with an emergency at work. 'When I saw Alan I knew it wasn’t something I could deal with so I dialled 999. 'In the ambulance we told them to go to my hospital, City General, which has just opened a new A&E and when we got there they were fantastic. 'I work in the elderly care unit at the hospital and I wasn’t expecting to be visiting A&E this quickly. 'Alan is a builder and obviously he’s had a ribbing from his mates about the whole thing but I’m just glad he’s home in one piece.' Mark Smith, crew manager at Market Drayton fire station, said it took about 20 minutes to free Mr Williams from the stairs. He said: 'Alan was carrying out some DIY work earlier in the evening and was home alone when it happened so he couldn’t reach his mobile phone. 'It was a five-inch nail so he was completely stuck at the top of the stairs. 'There was no way the nail could be removed so the only way to do it was to by removing the top step, which was still attached to him when he was bandaged and went to hospital.' Incredibly, thanks to the work of doctors, Mr Williams  will have full use of his vital hand for work.","Alan Williams was home alone and unable to move to get help .

"Shocking surveillance video shows the moment a 67-year-old Utah mother of three unknowingly drank a toxic cup of iced tea and spend nearly two weeks unable to speak because of lye poisoning. The footage shows Jan Harding sweetening her iced tea at Dickey's Barbeque in South Jordan, a Salt Lake City suburb, and taking a single sip of the beverage on Aug. 10. She immediately notices something is wrong, hunching over a trash can and barfing the remains of her drink. A fellow customer and a store manager stop by to check on her, but she continues to throw up. Harding, 67, has been recovering at home since she was released from University of Utah Hospital on Aug. 20, some 10 days after she was rushed there with lye poisoning. She remained unable to speak for the duration of her stay at the hospital. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Jan Harding, 67, sweetens her drink (left) and takes her first sip (right). She immediately notices a foul taste . A split second later, Harding  is hunched over a trash can, throwing up what she would later discover to be a toxic cup of lye-laced tea . Harding drinks several cups of water trying to clean out the toxins from her body . But it's to no avail: She continues to throw up. A store manager checks in on Harding while she struggles to regain her composure . Authorities have said a restaurant employee unintentionally put the heavy-duty cleaner lye in a sugar bag, and another worker mistakenly mixed it into the iced tea dispenser. Lye, which looks like sugar, is an odorless chemical used for degreasing deep fryers. Jan Harding, a mother of three, was the first one to drink from the chemically laced batch of tea. No one one else was harmed. She has been recovering with her family at home after making progress at the hospital that is 'nothing short of miraculous,' said Paxton Gyumon, Harding's family attorney. Harding must still undergo tests and procedures to determine any long-term complications, Guymon said. 'The family sincerely appreciates all of the support and prayers from everyone who has followed her story,' he said. Harding has been slowly improving since the incident, when the industrial cleaning solution lye mixed into the tea and caused deep, ulcerated burns in Harding's esophagus. The victim's husband, Jim Harding, says he is focused on his wife's recovery and not lawsuits . Attorney Paxton Guymon, who represents the Harding family, says another woman person was also poisoned with lye at the restaurant in July . Her husband, Jim Harding, has said that his wife has had nightmares about the moment that made her say, 'I think I drank acid.' Jim Harding, 66, said he's focused on his wife's recovery and not criminal charges or lawsuits. Salt Lake County prosecutors are reviewing a police investigation and have not announced if charges will be filed. The Dallas-based Dickey's Barbecue Restaurants Inc. has said the incident was isolated and unprecedented in the chain's 73-year history. Guyman has recently said that he discovered another lye incident at the South Jordan restaurant in July. An employee there burned herself when she stuck her finger in a sugar container and licked it to test for the chemical cleaner, he said. The employee's tongue began bleeding and blistering. She quit on Aug. 9, the day before Harding was burned, Guymon said. Dickey's Barbecue Restaurants has not commented on the new allegations.

Patrol: Two armed officers on their rounds in Parliament Square, awaiting the arrival of Lady Thatcher's coffin .

One Twitter user wrote: 'I think the . best protest against the Thatcher funeral would be to go the day before . and pour milk on to the route.' Police were under pressure last night . to crack down on plans by protesters to turn their backs on the coffin . in a gesture of disrespect.

Ceremony: Soldiers rehearsing the funeral of Baroness Thatcher yesterday, carrying a coffin outside St Paul's . Police . chiefs said they are ‘not there to uphold respect’ and said . demonstrators who are merely ‘insulting’ are unlikely to face arrest. But they faced a backlash from many who questioned why anyone would want to be so disrespectful to the dead stateswoman. Hundreds of people have signed up to online sites vowing to wear red and turn their back on the military funeral cortege. They want to occupy high-profile points of Lady Thatcher’s three mile funeral procession so their views will not be missed. Regal: The funeral of former Prime Minister Baroness Thatcher will be attended by luminaries from around the world and is expected to cost £10m . Organiser . Rebecca Lush Blum, 41, of Warsash, Hampshire, said that by giving the . green light police have encouraged others to join in. The . environmental campaigner said: ‘It is symbolic gesture that I turn my . back on Thatcherism and all it stood for and I hope other people will . join me.’ John Cooper, QC, . the architect behind the back-turning protest, said the public nature of . the funeral means it is impossible to ban insulting gestures. He . said: ‘Simply saying it is beastly, horrible or distasteful - a point . of view that I can understand - does not take away the fact there will . be a proportion of society that rightly wants to legally demonstrate. ‘Therefore . what I am doing is trying to provide an outlet for people who so chose . who want to demonstrate. I’m not saying they should or they shouldn’t, . but for those that choose to there should be a legal way. ‘It might well be cathartic or . therapeutic for some to do so and one legal way, and the police have . agreed it is legal, is to turn your backs on the cortege.’ Scotland Yard refused to say how many groups have asked for permission to demonstrate during the funeral. But several Facebook protest groups that sprung up since Lady Thatcher died have attracted a vocal and enthusiastic following. One group, Maggie’s Good Riddance Party, threatens to hold a ‘right jolly knees-up’ outside St Paul’s Cathedral. Index on Censorship defended the right to protest during the funeral, arguing that police were obliged to protect peaceful demonstrations. 'Some may feel it is distasteful to protest at a funeral but the right to protest is fundamental to a democracy,' chief executive Kirsty Hughes said. 'The role of the police is to maintain order not to prevent legitimate protest by those who wish to show dissent.' Anger: Anarchists, students and militant far left groups have held parties to celebrate the death of Baroness Thatcher . Retired . chief constable Dr Tim Brain said police are forced to tread the fine . line between the right to protest and upholding the law. The . retired Gloucestershire chief said shouting insults may even be . tolerated as behaviour that is ‘insulting but not alarming or . distressing’ may be allowed. He said police will have the ‘human rights’ of protesters to ‘freedom of expression’ at the front of their minds. Asked if shouting would be an offence, he replied: ‘It depends what is being shouted. That is the very fine judgment you have to make about policing in a democracy.’ Speaking on BBC Radio 4, he said police will be ‘very firm’ if protest becomes disruption, for example if objects are thrown at the procession. Dr Brain said: ‘My expectation will be that when you move from peaceful protest into acts of disruption that is where the line will be crossed.’ Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative chairman, described protesters as ‘mindless bigots’ but said police have no option if they obey the law. He said their actions will not provoke her supporters, adding: ‘Hopefully, those of us who admire Margaret Thatcher are too well-mannered to fall for the bait.’ Lady Thatcher’s former press secretary Sir Bernard Ingham accused police of ‘conniving at a display of bad taste.’ He said: ‘The plain fact is that we know exactly what these Left and anarchist groups do - they break convention and they enjoy doing it. ‘I’m absolutely certain there will be people who take great offence and are deeply upset by these protests because they don’t think it is the way to behave.’","Police ask businesses to put away tools which could be used as weapons .

"Everyone who owns a home worth £1 million or more will be targeted in  a new ‘anti-affluence’ crackdown by the Coalition. A beefed-up squad of computer and legal experts will pore over their property, savings and income. If they think the individual is not paying enough tax, they will have the power to knock on their front door and force them to account for every penny. The move is part of a tax-dodging purge on the rich forced through by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. Scroll down for video . Crackdown: Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander spoke to the Mail on Sunday . Fellow Lib Dem Danny Alexander, the Treasury Chief Secretary, who was accused of benefiting from a tax loophole on second homes, told The Mail on Sunday that the Coalition is to launch a triple-pronged attack on the well-off designed to raise hundreds of millions of pounds. In an exclusive interview with this newspaper, Mr Alexander, one of the Coalition’s all-powerful ‘Quad’ with David Cameron, George Osborne and Mr Clegg, vowed to ‘sniff out’ wealthy tax cheats. ‘The measure will apply to people with homes and assets of more than £1 million,’ he said. He denied it showed the Lib Dems were against successful hard-working people who made money, but insisted the well-off had to dig deeper to help clear the UK’s debts, saying: ‘The wealthiest did best in the boom years and it is right they should pay more now.’ He is boosting HM Revenue and Customs’ 200-strong Orwellian-sounding Affluence Unit, set up to probe 300,000 people worth more than £2.5 million – and widening its net. The Affluence Unit’s strength will rise to 300 as its range is extended to include 500,000 people worth more than £1 million. Mr Alexander said: ‘We will use IT software to look across files and records and work out features in someone’s affairs that suggest there’s avoidance going on. They will look at anomalies and sniff out any problems.’ An HMRC source said it would ‘target affluent individuals owning offshore property’, develop a ‘serial avoiders unit’ to tackle avoidance, and ‘undertake a range of interventions to change the long-term behaviour of those using avoidance products’. Mr Alexander said he and Mr Clegg would love to go further and impose a mansion tax on homes worth over £2 million, arguing it is the hardest kind of wealth tax to avoid. ‘You cannot dodge it – a home is not something you can shuffle off to Monaco,’ he said. 'Anti-affluence': Anybody who owns a home worth £1million or more will come under extra scrutiny . Mr Cameron has refused point blank to back the mansion tax, or a similar ‘tycoon tax’ put forward by Mr Clegg. As a result, the Lib Dems are threatening to refuse to support Tory plans for a new round of public spending cuts in another clash that threatens to wreck the Coalition. However, some Tories may feel Mr Clegg has got round Mr Cameron by using the new probe into people with £1 million homes as a ‘back-door mansion tax’. When it was pointed out that Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne would lose out from a mansion tax because they both own property worth well over £2 million, Mr Alexander – a lowly press officer with Cairngorm National Parks before he became an MP and Mr Osborne’s deputy – declared: ‘Well I don’t!’ 'The measures will apply to people with homes and assets of more than £1m' Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander . Asked how much he is worth, he replied: ‘I have a two-bedroom flat in London worth £300,000 to £400,000 and a home in Scotland worth a bit less.’ He did not conceal tensions in the Coalition over the Lib Dem ‘squeeze the rich’ tax crackdown, saying pointedly: ‘George Osborne is always saying, “We’re all in this together”.’ Critics are bound to point out that Mr Alexander was at the centre of a tax furore of his own in the MPs’ expenses scandal. Support: Mr Alexander's plan was reinforced by Nick Clegg at the Lib Dem conference in Brighton . He admitted using a loophole to legally avoid paying Capital Gains Tax by designating his London property as his second home for his MPs’ expenses – but described it to the HMRC as his main home. Under his initiative, wealthy BBC stars could also receive a visit by HMRC investigators. He is furious at the Corporation’s failure to copy Whitehall’s lead in stopping top civil servants slashing their tax bill by being paid via a private company. He has written to BBC boss Mr Entwistle demanding action. ‘The only part of the public sector that did not follow our example was the BBC,’ he said. ‘I will be writing to the new Director General saying BBC employees must be paid openly and transparently.’ The Corporation has admitted paying ‘up to 3,000’ actors, editors, make-up artists and other ‘craft staff’ through service companies – with 36 earning more than £100,000 – but has refused to reveal how many top names were paid this way. Presenters Jeremy Paxman, Emily Maitlis and Fiona Bruce were reportedly among those who set up companies to channel their earnings. Rich soccer stars will also have their tax affairs scrutinised. ‘I am not ascribing any particular moral characteristics to footballers,’ said Mr Alexander. ‘But experts will identify warning signs, make sure their tax affairs are in order and approach the individual and “have a conversation” if they aren’t.’ HMRC has already ‘had a conversation’ with several Premiership stars, leading them to be forced to pay up to £100,000 each in tax ‘fines’– and the number will rise with the new purge. Mr Alexander’s plan was reinforced by Mr Clegg as he arrived at the Lib Dem conference in Brighton last night. He said: ‘It’s wrong that people on low and middle incomes who work hard and play by the rules are taxed so much while Russian oligarchs pay the same council tax as some do on a family home.’","Owners of homes worth £1m or more will come under scrutiny as part of Coalition's new 'anti-affluence' crackdown .

"Two children aged 11 or under are being rushed to hospital every week over drinking, new figures today revealed. A shocking 102 youngsters were admitted to A&E departments across England for excessive consumption of alcohol last year. They were among 2,084 under-15s - more than five per day - to be seen at emergency units for alcohol-related reasons. Shocking: Two children aged 11 or under are being rushed to hospital every week over drinking (file image) In total, 7,892 under-18s were admitted in 2012/13, according to the figures obtained by The Sun. Labour health spokesman Jamie Reed, who unveiled the statistics, said: 'This Government is failing to tackle the availability of strong, cheap alcohol that appeals to children.' Across all ages, 609,894 people were rushed to A&E units over drinking last year - compared to a fewer 606,061 in 2011/12. Aged 11 and under - 102 (two per week) Aged 15 and under - 2,084 (five per day) Aged 18 and under - 7,892 (21 per day) All age groups - 609,894 (1,670 per day) Alcohol Concern branded the figures 'a disgrace', saying that 'heavily-advertised' and 'cheap' brands of alcohol were sending out the 'wrong message' to children. 'Heavily advertised brands and cheap, strong booze are the drinks of choice for vulnerable children and young people,' it said in an earlier statement. 'Alcohol advertising is linked to . consumption, particularly in those under 18 years old, and it’s time we . introduced robust measures which protect this group from exposure to it. 'We already know that price is a key . factor when young people buy alcohol so we have got to stop selling . booze at pocket money prices.' Under current law, it is illegal for people under the age of 18 to buy alcohol in a pub, shop or elsewhere. Emergency: A staggering 102 youngsters were admitted to A&E departments across England for excessive consumption of alcohol last year. They were among 2,084 under-15s - more than five per day - to be admitted . However, adults can legally purchase alcohol for children aged five and under to drink at home. Earlier this year, it was revealed that children as young as four are among . hundreds of youngsters being referred to specialist drug and alcohol . treatment services in the UK. Treatment . experts said the most common reason for children to come into contact . with alcohol is through their parents and preventative work is . key to heading off misuse among youngsters. The Department of Health said the number of A&E admissions among under-18s was falling, but added: 'The number of people drinking is still too high.' A spokesman told The Sun the department is looking at introducing alcohol awareness programmes in schools to teach children about the risks of drinking. MailOnline has contacted the Department of Health for comment.","Over 100 children aged 11 or under rushed to A&E over drinking last year .

"Andrew Faulds, 40, from Greenford, west London, was jailed for 15 years after police found video footage of the horrific act, as well as hundreds of indecent images of children on his phone and laptop . A youth football coach and children's worker who filmed himself raping a 13-year-old girl with severe learning difficulties has been jailed for 15 years. Andrew Faulds, from Greenford, west London, was sentenced at Harrow Crown Court after police investigators found video footage of the horrific act, as well as hundreds of indecent images of children, on his mobile phone and laptop. The 40-year-old, who previously worked as a learning mentor for the Ealing tuition service in Southall, as a youth worker at Brentford FC Community Sports Trust and for Ealing Council's play service, pleaded guilty to a number of sex offences during today's court appearance. He was caught after the video of a child being raped was seized during an arrest in Canada. Detectives established that the video had been recorded on March 26, 2011, on a mobile phone on an estate in Southall, west London. The case was handed over to the Metropolitan Police and officers identified the victim in the video as a girl with severe learning difficulties. Further inquiries then led to the identification of Faulds, who was arrested on suspicion of rape at his home on March 7. Police were able to match the living room where the act occurred in the video to Faulds' previous address. He pleaded guilty to two counts of oral rape two weeks later but further investigations revealed he owned hundreds of indecent images of children, including one that showed him masturbating in the same room as a young girl. He was charged with further offences of possessing and distributing indecent images and sexual activity in the presence of a child under 13. He admitted all of the offences in court today. Detectives now believe Faulds may have committed even more offences and are urging anyone with information to come forward. Faulds was sentenced to 15 years at Harrow Crown Court (pictured) after admitting two counts of oral rape and further offences of possessing and distributing indecent images and sexual activity in the presence of a child . Met Police detective constable Emma Macdonald said: 'Faulds has proven himself to be a predatory paedophile who took advantage in the most despicable way of a young girl with learning difficulties. 'He has an unnatural interest in children that he fuelled by accessing hundreds of indecent images and interacting with other paedophiles online. 'This case demonstrates the world-wide commitment to tackling child abuse and paedophilia and I am pleased this process has led to Faulds' conviction. He has been sentenced to a substantial jail term, thankfully putting him out of reach of other children. 'We believe these offences were not his first and would appeal for any other victims to approach us in confidence.'","Andrew Faulds, 40, raped a 13-year-old girl with severe learning difficulties .

"A disused London Underground station that was used as a Second World War command centre has been sold for £53million. Brompton Road Tube station, in an expensive corner of London near Harrods, was put on the market in September by the Ministry of Defence as part of cost-cutting efforts. Funds from the sale will go back into the defence budget, and the site is expected to be transformed into ultra-luxurious flats or houses. Scroll down for video . Sold by the MoD: The former Brompton Road Tube station will be turned into expensive luxury flats . The station, which lies on the Piccadilly Line, was closed in 1934 because of a lack of passengers . The station was reportedly used to interrogate Rudolf Hess after he was taken prisoner during WW2 . The identity of the buyer has not been revealed but a previous sale of the site, to a Ukrainian billionaire for £50million, is said to have fallen through. The former Tube station site, between the Brompton Oratory and Brompton Square, will be developed by Michael Spink, an Oxfordshire-based property tycoon who spent £42million developing a country estate near Henley before selling it to a Russian billionaire for £140million. Mr Spink told MailOnline he hoped to transform it into a 'very high quality residential development' and said that, allowing time for planning negotiations, he expected the project to take four or five years to complete. The Piccadilly Line station, which was designed by English architect Leslie Green, retains its original distinctive green and brown wall tiles - the hallmark of many of the Underground's historic stations. It was opened in 1906 but closed in 1934 after London Underground decided it was no longer financially viable. During the Blitz, the building was taken over by Winston Churchill's War Office and used to control anti-aircraft batteries to protect London from air raids. All change: The station will now be transformed by high-end property developer, Michael Spink . The £53million proceeds from the sale of the former station will go back into the Ministry of Defence's budget . Long way down: The Ministry of Defence bought the station in 1939 for £22,000 and have sold it for £53million . Hitler's right-hand man, Rudolf Hess, was reportedly interrogated there after he was taken prisoner during World War Two. The 28,000 sq ft property contains a drill hall, garages, offices and mess above ground and has recently been occupied by the London University Air Squadron (UAS), the London University Royal Naval Unit (URNU), and 46F Squadron Air Training Corps (Air cadets). There are also several underground areas, previously used as part of the former Brompton Road Underground station, but they have been left largely unused since the end of the Second World War. Today, the only remnants of the site's military past are a large map of London, the MoD said. It is working with the National Archives to make sure it is retained. Announcing the £53million sale, defence minister Andrew Murrison said: 'The Ministry of Defence is committed to selling off its surplus land and property in order to provide the best possible value for money to the taxpayer. 'At the same time we take our role as a custodian of the nation's history very seriously and have been working to record the historic significance of the building.' There are understood to be 32 ghost stations across London's underground network, abandoned over the years as lines were diverted or the number of passengers passing through dwindled.Like Brompton Road, many of the stations have links to the Second World War. Down Street - last used as a station in May 1932, became an air raid shelter after the war broke out, and Aldwych was used by thousands of Londoners during the Blitz.The empty station in Westminster has been used as a location for films including Atonement, V for Vendetta, Superman 4 and 28 Weeks Later.Other abandoned stations still remain at City Road, which was on the Northern Line until it closed its doors in 1922, Marlborough Road, which was on the Metropolitan Line, and South Kentish Town, which closed in 1924.York Road closed in 1932 because it was under-used, while North End is unique in that it is a closed Tube station that never actually opened.Intended to be the deepest station on the underground network, work on North End stopped in 1906 because it was not deemed financially viable.","Brompton Road tube station closed in 1934 because of lack of passengers .

"A leading British poet who is dying of kidney failure is appealing for a donor to come forward after doctors warned that he does not have long left. Award-winning writer Hugo Williams was diagnosed with kidney failure two-and-a-half years ago and has to endure gruelling dialysis three times a week for four hours a time. His desperate family has now started a Facebook campaign to find a matching donor who can give the 72-year-old poet his quality of life back. Poet Hugo Williams is appealing for a kidney donor to come forward as he is dying of kidney failure . Mr Williams, the brother of Upstairs Downstairs actor Simon Williams, has also offered to immortalise the kindness of the donor in verse. The T.S. Eliot prize winner said: ‘Anything would be better than feeling like this. I’m tired of living this life. I have to be at a certain level of fitness to be eligible for a transplant and my health is declining. ‘It’s just a guess, but the next three months are likely to be crucial. In reality, we don’t know how long it will be. ‘I’m just worried that this transplant won’t come off. I desperately need to find a donor. Time is running out.’ His daughter Murphy Williams, 45, of Cornwall, said: ‘My nagging, unspoken fear is that my father will die on the waiting list, well before his time. He was healthy and active before the dialysis. ‘Every time he doesn’t pick up the phone, my family and I go into an awful panic, thinking the worst. The fear is always there. Mr Williams was diagnosed with kidney failure two-and-a-half years ago and has been warned time is running out to find him a donor. His family has set up a Facebook page to help find him a new kidney (pictured) ‘I feel like he deserves a lot more life and shouldn’t be going through this. It would just be awful if he was condemned to this limbo life.’ Mr Williams, the son of actor Hugh Williams and the model and actress Margaret Vyner, attended Eton College and has won many poetry prizes. He has written a collection of poems called From the Dialysis Ward detailing his suffering, some of which have been nominated for the Forward poetry prize. A new collection, I Knew the Bride, has just been published. The poet was diagnosed with kidney failure two-and-a-half years ago and has been on dialysis ever since while he waits for a kidney transplant. But there are just 3,000 kidney transplants each year and roughly 6,000 people on the waiting list, according to Kidney Research UK. His daughter said: ‘My father is not coping well on dialysis. Mr Williams' family are worried he will die waiting for a kidney because he will soon be too weak for surgery . ‘It’s very much a half-life. You’re . just waiting and you’re not able to live. The waiting list is getting . longer and longer. It used to be two to three years.’ Mrs . Williams, who runs a luxury marshmallow company, added: ‘It’s a huge . change to his life and he’s had lots of bad reactions to the treatment. The main thing is that it saps your energy and makes you very weak. He . has a diminished quality of life,’ she said. ‘He’s led such a healthy life and he’s always been fit and trim and eaten healthily. ‘My . father is a poet. He’s incredibly sensitive and fragile. He’s also . sociable and he likes living his life and this is a just a shell of a . life and he is depressed. ‘He’s . not the same and he knows he’s not the same. I would just love to get . my dad back. I want him to come to Cornwall to visit his grandchildren . who adore him. Mr Williams is married to art curator Hermine Demoriane, 71, who lives between Britain and France, and the pair have one daughter together. Miss Demoriane, who uses her maiden name, launched a Facebook and Twitter campaign to track down a donor three weeks ago and the page already has a thousand followers. The T.S. Eliot prize winner said: 'Anything would be better than feeling like this. I'm tired of living this life' She is also trying to arrange a cross . match with another donor, so she can donate her kidney to a person who . has a healthy relative or friend who is able to donate to Mr Williams. Peter . Storey, of Kidney Research UK, said: ‘Around 6,000 people are waiting . for a kidney but fewer than 3,000 transplants are carried out each year. ‘The prevalence of patients presenting with kidney failure is increasing steadily by four per cent each year. Many people who could benefit from a kidney transplant remain on dialysis, which offers a restricted quality of life. And sadly, around one person a day dies whilst waiting. ‘There is currently no cure for kidney diseases, so early detection is vital to provide any chance of halting, preventing or reversing the damage to the kidney caused by the disease. ‘However, the signs are often difficult to spot which is why the disease is often referred to as the “silent killer” and many patients go undiagnosed until their kidneys completely fail.’ The Facebook page can be found at facebook.com/hugowilliamskidney and the Twitter hashtag is #teamhugo .","Hugo Williams was diagnosed with kidney failure more than two years ago .

"A debris field at the bottom of Lake Michigan may be the remains of the long-lost Griffin, a vessel commanded by a 17th-century French explorer, said a shipwreck hunter who has sought the wreckage for decades. According to Steve Libert, his crew found the debris this month about 120 feet from the spot where they removed a wooden slab a year ago that was protruding from the lake bottom. Libert believes that timber was the bowsprit of Rene-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle's ship, although scientists who joined the 2013 expedition say the slab more likely was an abandoned fishing net stake. Timbers that were discovered by Steve Libert, head of Great Lakes Exploration Group, in 2001 protrude from the bottom of Lake Michigan . French underwater archaeologist Olivia Hulot makes notes while inspecting a timber jutting from the bottom of northern Lake Michigan that experts believe could be part of the long-lost ship the Griffin on Saturday June 15, 2013 .

He described the bottomland area as littered with wooden planks that could belong to a ship's bow, along with nails and pegs that would have fastened the hull to the rest of the vessel and what appeared to be sections of a mast. He acknowledged his dive team had found no 'smoking gun' such as a cannon or other artifacts with markings identifying them as belonging to the Griffin. But the nails and other implements appeared similar to those from La Belle, another of La Salle's ships that sank near the Gulf of Mexico, Libert said. Explorer Steve Libert speaks on a fishing boat as dive teams prepare to inspect a site in northern Lake Michigan earlier this month . He said his organization has sent images of the debris to three French underwater archaeologists who took part in last year's search. They plan to seek state and federal permits to excavate in the area in September, Libert said. Dean Anderson, Michigan's state archaeologist, said on Monday he hadn't been notified of the find and could not speculate about whether the Griffin had finally been located. Anderson supports the theory that the timber discovered earlier was a fishing apparatus. The area strewn with debris is roughly the size of a football field, said Brian Abbott of Nautilus Marine Group, who joined Libert's search this month and took sonar readings of the bottomlands. The Griffin - or Le Griffon - was a sailing ship built on the Niagara River in the 1670s . French explorer Robert de La Salle hoped to use it to find the Northwest Passage to China and Japan, however it vanished in 1679 . French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle explored the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada, the Mississippi River, and the Gulf of Mexico . It is near tiny Poverty Island in northwestern Lake Michigan and about 50 feet below the water's surface. The Griffin is believed to be the first ship of European design to sail the upper Great Lakes. It disappeared with a crew of six on its maiden voyage in 1679 after La Salle had disembarked near the mouth of Wisconsin's Green Bay.","The Griffin - or Le Griffon - was a sailing ship built on the Niagara River in the 1670s .

"A mystery fish with terrifying tusk-like spikes near its mouth and spines along its body has been caught off the coast of Borneo. The discovery has baffled fisherman in the area and the authorities are also scrabbling to identify the foot-long species. Locals have temporarily named it the Armour Fish, courtesy of its sharp spines on the top and bottom of its body, which gets progressively smaller towards the tail. Anyone for supper? This frightening fish, complete with tusk-like spikes and spines along its body has been caught in the South China Sea off Borneo . Who's NOT a pretty boy, then? The Protected Areas and Biodiversity Conservation Division of Sarawak Forestry Corporation is currently looking into identifying the creature . Angler Sapar Mansor, 43, from Taman Ceria, Permyjaya, caught the fish in the South China Sea near Tudan, Malaysia. He told the Borneo Post: 'This is the first time in my life that I have seen this type of fish. I brought it home to my wife and informed her of the rare catch. Sapar said he and a friend went out in a fishing boat and travelled two hours from Miri River to the sea. They started fishing at around 5am and landed his surprising catch about an hour after arriving at a location many miles from Miri. Brave: Siti Kadariah, the wife of the angler who caught the fish, and their daughter with the creature at home. They have temporarily named it the Armour Fish thanks to its sharp spines . The Protected Areas and Biodiversity Conservation Division of Sarawak Forestry Corporation (SFC) is currently looking into identifying the creature. Oswald Braken Tisen, the deputy general manager, said: 'SFC has not been able to established what kind of fish it is but is in the process of checking with relevant authorities.' Sapar's wife Siti Kadariah and his children have taken to calling the creature 'Armour Fish' for now thanks to its sharp spines. Siti, 35, added: 'My husband caught this rare species and I was surprised to see the fish. 'When my husband brought the fish home, both my children were stunned because of its shape and uniqueness.' Siti has decided to dry the fish so that it can be preserved and kept at their home. 'It is God's gift and I and my family will keep the fish,' she added.","Foot-long creature has baffled authorities who are scrabbling to identify it .

"The BBC has been urged to reveal its plans for Scottish independence amidst fears the licence fee could double in the event of a 'Yes' vote in next week's referendum. The Corporation has so far refused to speculate on what could happen after Thursday's vote, insisting that no contingency plans have been drawn up. However, senior politicians have called for transparency over the future level of the licence fee, in order to ensure that Scottish voters can make a well-informed decision at the polls. There are also questions over the future of the many BBC programmes which are currently produced at the Corporation's Scottish headquarters in Glasgow - including hit sitcom Mrs Brown's Boys and political flagship Question Time. Scroll down for video . Threat: Popular programmes such as Mrs Brown's Boys and Question Time, starring David Dimbleby, are currently based at the BBC's Scottish headquarters in Glasgow . Licence fee: Alex Salmond insists that an independent Scotland would keep the BBC, but there are fears the cost could soar . The latest news comes after businesses continued to speak out against the risks posed by independence, while UKIP leader Nigel Farage suggested that the Queen should intervene in a last-ditch attempt to save the Union. The Scottish National Party has repeatedly insisted that an independent Scotland would be able to keep the BBC, along with other UK institutions such as the NHS and the Monarchy. But as the Corporation would no longer be able to subsidise Scottish services from the rest of Britain, it is not know how the level of the licence fee would be affected. The Guardian reported today that a secret internal document produced by the BBC in 2011 suggested the fee might have to double from £145.50 to nearly £300 in an independent Scotland. A source told the paper: 'In Scotland, revenue raised is well south of the value of services they receive.' The BBC is believed to raise around £320million from the 2.2million Scottish licence fee payers, according to the latest available figures. Most of that money goes on programmes and services broadcast to the whole of the UK, but £102million is spent every year on content intended for an exclusively Scottish audience. The BBC's Gaelic-language TV station, BBC Alba, is part-funded by the Scottish government, but its other services in the country draw from the overall pot of licence fee payments. Silence: Rona Fairhead, incoming chairman of the BBC, has supported the Corporation's policy of refusing to plan for an independence vote . In other countries of a comparable size to Scotland, such as Ireland and Denmark, public broadcasting is nearly twice as expensive per head of population as it is in the UK. The licence fee is Denmark is 2,414 krone, around £260, while in Ireland the €160 (£130) fee makes up only half the income of the public broadcaster RTÉ. BBC channels which are broadcast outside the UK, such as BBC World and BBC America, are funded by advertising. The Last Night of the Proms is one of the key dates in the calendar of British patriotism - but this year, the BBC is keen to keep politics out of it altogether. Presenter and stars of tomorrow night's concert, including Katherine Jenkins and Terry Wogan, are set to be reminded that they must focus on the music - and not mention the Scottish independence referendum. Politicians and cultural figures have called for the Last Night of the Proms to be a celebration of Britishness ahead of next Thursday's poll. But the BBC is adamant that it must remain an apolitical event, and will brief those appearing to remind them not to talk about 'things that aren't music related'. The Corporation insists that this is standard guidance issued every year, but tomorrow's concert is considered particularly symbolic due to the impending referendum. Historian Simon Schama said this week that the Proms 'might be the last time' for the UK to come together as a whole, and suggested that the historic occasion should be celebrated. Politicians such as Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, and entertainers including Vera Lynn, agreed that the concert should display the strengths of the Union and Scotland's contribution to national culture. 'The best way of sharing our cultural lives is to stay together,' Dame Vera told the Telegraph. 'Rule Britannia was written by a Scot! This concert is a wonderful opportunity to share our musical heritage.' However, the BBC is so intent on staying impartial that several of its best-known personalities are believed to have refused show support for the Union in case they breach the Corporation's rules. 'It's business as usual for the Last Night of the Proms,' a BBC spokesman said. 'There is no heavy edict not to mention the referendum - as is standard, if it was editorially justified on the night it would be reflected. 'In line with previous years presenters and artists will be reminded that the BBC Proms is a music event not a political platform.' Ben Bradshaw, the former Culture Secretary, urged the BBC to publish information about the future of the licence fee before the referendum vote. 'The future of the BBC in Scotland and the level of the licence fee was raised with me on the doorstep when I was campaigning in Scotland this week,' he told the Guardian. 'If Scots wish to keep a Scottish BBC or something like it in the event of independence, they will lose the BBC's economy of scale and will face paying much more if they wish to keep quality public service broadcasting.' A BBC source told MailOnline that there had been no attempts to supress any internal reports, adding that the Corporation had made no decisions on the future of the licence fee. The BBC's incoming chairman Rona Fairhead told MPs this week that it was right to delay plans for the future until after the referendum vote, in order to remain impartial during the independence campaign. A spokesman said: 'As we have consistently stated we have done no planning about the future of BBC services after the referendum, including any calculations about the level of a licence fee.' As well as questions over the licence fee, a 'Yes' vote in the referendum could cast doubt over the future of BBC programmes which are produced in Scotland. Mrs Brown's Boys, starring Irish comedian Brendan O'Carroll, is filmed in a studio in Glasgow, and Question Time's producers are based in Scotland although the programme moves around the UK for each episode. Other popular programmes produced by BBC Scotland have included school drama Waterloo Road and detective series Wallander. Last month, Scottish TV producers spoke out against the BBC's refusal to plan for the future, saying it could leave the creative arts industry in limbo for up to two years. A spokesman for Better Together, the anti-independence campaign group, said the uncertainty over the BBC could jeopardise the 'good deal' currently enjoyed by Scottish audiences. 'The BBC is one of the most respected national institutions we have and people in Scotland don't support Alex Salmond's plan to break it up,' he said. 'Licence fee payers in Scotland contribute around £320million a year but we benefit from programming and production worth £3.6billion. That's a good deal for Scotland.' But Blair Jenkins, chief executive of Yes Scotland, said: 'The current Scottish Government has made it absolutely clear that the licence fee payable in Scotland at the point of independence will be the same as the rest of the UK. 'In an independent Scotland, viewers will continue to receive the programmes and channels currently enjoyed, but with significantly more programmes being commissioned and produced in Scotland.'","Reports suggest licence fee in Scotland could double to nearly £300 .

The tiny cottage, which has no electricity or mains gas, has stunning views across Weymouth Bay . The rather modest living room inside the terraced property - which was built in 1902 . However, there is no electricity or mains gas - while water is harvested from rainfall and stored in underground tanks. It has a log burner and septic tank, with accommodation consisting of two bedrooms, two reception rooms and a bathroom. Despite the lack of amenities, the cottage was lived in for the past 30 years by a gentleman who passed away last year at the age of 94.

Paul Mooney, Savills auctioneer, said: 'It is a real hideaway on the cliffs, overlooking Weymouth and Portland. 'There are spectacular views, it really is unique.

'This property provides prospective purchasers with the rare opportunity to be completely at one with nature whilst enjoying some of the most spectacular views you'll find anywhere in the UK. 'Properties such as this are hard to come by as they are rarely for sale in the public domain and it would provide a wonderful opportunity for a second home owner looking for a unique project. 'Nothing like this will ever be built again and so it really is one of the country's last great coastal hideaways.

"The victim . of a sick acid attack that left her blind and deaf has pleaded with the . Indian authorities to help her find justice, or else allow her to die. Sonali Mukherjee's face was . disfigured forever in 2003, when she was just 17 years old, by intruders . who broke into her home in Dhanbad, Jharkhand. Her assailants, who had allegedly been sexually abusing her for years, poured the acid over her while she was sleeping. Horrific violence: Sonali Mukherjee as an NCC cadet at 17, left, and now, nine years after the acid attack, right . Nine years later, after having received no money or assistance from the state, the desperate woman says that if the government will not help her then she may decide to end her life. She is blind in both eyes and has no right ear, her treatment is taking its toll on her family's limited finances - and her attackers are out on bail. Describing the events of April 22, 2003, Miss Mukherjee said: 'I woke up feeling strange. Within a . few seconds it felt like my whole body was on fire. I kept . screaming in pain till I passed out.' Happy youth: Miss Mukherjee at an awards ceremony before the attack . Unable to take much more, she recently approached the minister for women and child development . Krishna Tirath while in New Delhi for treatment. 'All . these years, I have been living only on assurances. If the government . cannot help me then it should allow me to kill myself,' she said. 'I was an NCC cadet, but I had to quit after the . attack. NCC had given me the courage to fight all odds and that's how I . have survived till today. But I am tired now.' Her treatment - 22 operations . and several consultations - has already run into hundreds of thousands of rupees. Her . family was forced to sell ancestral land, her mother's jewellery and is . practically penniless. The operations have only . helped give her disfigured face some shape. 'I need at least 1 to 1.5million rupees (£11,600 to £17,400) to look even remotely human and have my eyesight restored,' she . said. She described approaching the government as a last resort. 'I have knocked on . all doors. I have met three chief ministers [Shibu Soren, Arjun Munda . and Madhu Koda] and three MLAs. Let alone justice, I haven't received . any monetary help from the state.' Although Ms Tirath . has previously expressed her intention to help victims of acid attacks, . nothing has happened for Miss Mukherjee yet. The minister has roped in the ministries of law . and of home affairs to amend the Indian Penal Code to . either include a separate section on acid attacks or equate the gravity . of the crime to rape. Her ministry is also keen on curbing . over-the-counter sale of concentrated acid in the market. After Miss Mukherjee met Ms Tirath on July 9, . the latter wrote to the prime minister seeking financial . help from the Prime Minister's Relief Fund. Until then, the 27-year-old and her father are condemned to shuttle back and forth between . Jharkhand and the capital, where she is being treated at . Safdarjung hospital. - CHANDI DAS MUKHERJEE, FATHER . Her saviour may now have come in the . form of plastic surgeon Anant Sinha, however, who stepped forward to . offer free medical treatment at his hospital for Miss Mukherjee, . according to India Today. 'I . can understand the plight of the victim but she need not worry,' said . Dr Sinha. 'I will treat her free of cost at my hospital and if needed . even give her a job at my hospital for sustenance.' Miss Mukherjee was allegedly sexually abused for years by three youths living nearby before the acid attack. She was studying sociology honours in a Dhanbad women's college and also juggling a job with a private firm when the horrific incident occurred. Miss Mukherjee and her family were then forced to abandon their home in Dhanbad, and her mother slipped into depression. Her father Chandi Das Mukherjee said, 'We appealed in the high court... Nothing happened. They were sent to jail but were released soon after... Now they are busy enjoying their lives.' 'The law against acid attackers needs to be made tougher. Otherwise we will have many more Sonalis.' Police sources said that the victim and her family members are afraid since two of her attackers, Tapas Mitra and Sanjay Paswan, were released on bail six years ago. The third accused Brahmadev Hajra was let off as he was a juvenile at the time of crime.","Sonali Mukherjee was permanently disfigured by the horrific attack at just 17 .

"It may have taken six months, hundred of pictures and endless patience, but the efforts of Indian photographer Tapan Sheth have all been worth it after he managed to capture these stunning images of 'water sculptures'. Sheth, from Rajkot, in Gujarat, added coloured dye to liquid along with guar gum, a food thickener similar to cornflour, then set up his camera equipment. The 34-year-old  got these mesmerising images by letting a drop fall into the rest of the liquid, then quickly pressing the camera shutter. Tapan Sheth, 34, from India, took six months to create these mesmerising images by letting coloured droplets fall into liquid . To create the magical effects Sheth added coloured dyes and guar gum, a thickener similar to cornfour, to water before letting the drop fall . What do you see?: While each formation occurs naturally and is completely unique, many have an undeniable likeness to mushrooms, including these two . Sheth created all of the images in his own home in Rajkot, Gujarat province, including this one which resembles and umbrella . He said: 'There are lots of things involved in the photography of liquid sculptures. There is proper preparation, setup, controller and much more required to get the effect. 'The most important part is the passion; if you don't have passion you really won't able to achieve this. From 100's of clicks I hardly get five to ten perfect shots. Sometimes a complete session could fail.' As each shape only exists for a fraction of a second, timing really is the key to capturing these impressive images. Sheth says the most important element in his creations is passion, as for every 100 frames he takes, only five or ten might be useable images, and he has seen whole shoots fail to produce anything . Inkblot: The images are all similar to inkblot tests carried out by psychiatrists which can be viewed in a variety of different ways . This tree-like image was captured by Sheth who says: 'When I see my pictures, I don't have words what I see. Liquid sculptures are a jewel for me' While many of the droplets look similar, they can form into a variety of interesting 'sculptures' such as this one which looks like a wine glass or goblet . Many form into umbrella-like shapes, while some seem to mimic mushrooms and others look like trees with one resembling a cup. Tapan added: 'After many failed attempts and efforts I got the result I was looking for for my liquid sculpture photography. I really can't believe the reaction I get, it's simply awesome when you praised by people around the world. When I see my pictures, I don't have words for what I see. Liquid sculptures are a jewel for me.' Sheth is also a wildlife photographer taking pictures large animals such as lions, hyenas deer and monkeys; and insects like spiders, frogs and dragonflies . Creating liquid sculptures is a popular form of art and practitioners can be found across the globe, usually using hi-tech equipment and flash photography to create the dream-like images .","Tapan Sheth, a photographer from India, took six months to create these dream-like 'liquid sculptures'

"Phil Ivey (pictured) is suing London casino Crockfords Club for his £7.7million 'winnings' A top professional gambler described as 'arguably the best poker player in the world' is suing a London casino for his £7.7million 'winnings'. American Phil Ivey has brought his High Court claim over a version of baccarat cards known as Punto Banco which he played at Crockfords Club in Mayfair over two days in August 2012. Genting Casinos UK Ltd, which owns Crockfords, says that the technique of edge-sorting which Mr Ivey used - which provides the customer with an element of 'first card advantage' - is not a legitimate strategy and that it has no liability to him. After four sessions, Mr Ivey was told that the money would be wired to him and he left for the United States. But the money never arrived - although his stake of £1million was returned. The company claims that Mr Ivey's conduct defeated the essential premise of the game of baccarat so there was no gaming contract - or constituted cheating. Mr Ivey was accompanied at the 186-year-old casino by a companion Ms Cheung Sun also known as Cheung Kelly. Richard Spearman QC, representing the 38-year-old, told Mr Justice Mitting that the casino's case - that his conduct amounted to cheating -was 'plainly unsustainable|'. He said that edge-sorting involved nothing more than using information that was available to any player simply from viewing the backs of the cards which the casino chose to use. It also involved making requests of the casino - which it could accept or refuse - as to the manner in which play was conducted, he said. Mr Spearman added: 'Moreover, it is very easy for the casino to protect itself against the technique, not least by checking the cards for asymmetrical patterns before they are used in play, by not re-using the same cards after a shoe (the receptacle holding the decks) has been played, and by the elementary step of turning some of the cards once between shoes.' 'The central issue is whether the practice of edge-sorting which the claimant carried out in order to improve his betting opportunities and enabled him to win £7.7million, which he claims he won entirely lawfully, is a lawful or unlawful practice.' Scroll down for video . He described a casino as a 'cat and mouse environment'. 'It is an adversarial environment. Obviously, it does not mean you can be dishonest - we do not suggest that. But, you have to look at those circumstances when you consider cheating. 'The environment is a highly relevant feature and you have to look at the attributes of the person accused of dishonesty - a professional poker player who has an international reputation as an advantage player.' He told the judge: 'Our firm position is that the guts of cheating does involve dishonesty. It is the heart of the case. It has got to be grappled with.' Genting Casinos UK Ltd, which owns Crockfords Club (pictured), says that the technique of edge-sorting which Mr Ivey used - which provides the customer with an element of 'first card advantage' - is not a legitimate strategy . Mr Ivey (left) was accompanied at the 186-year-old casino by a companion Ms Cheung Sun (right) also known as Cheung Kelly . How to win big at 'punto banco' In action: Phil Ivey at the poker table during the 2009 World Series of Poker in Las Vegas . He said it was a serious matter for Mr Ivey who was charged with something which the defence said was a criminal offence or, if not that, conscious impropriety or lack of probity. Mr Ivey is described on the World Series of Poker website as 'arguably the best poker player in the world'. Mr Spearman said: 'You may have your own views about the standing of professional poker players but that is his occupation and it is a serious charge. 'He (Mr Ivey) regards this as utterly fair play. If the casino fouls up from start to finish, that is something which is the gambler's good fortune . It is not an easy thing to do. It requires a lot of skill.' The casino's counsel, Christopher Pymont QC, told Mr Justice Mitting - who is hearing the week-long action in London - that Ivey was not a well-known advantage player at the time of his visit but was, in their eyes, an old VIP customer and they trusted him accordingly. It argued that edge-sorting was not a widely known or practised way of playing baccarat in the UK and that the casino was not unduly careless in failing to prevent it . 'The scheme could have been - and was - cheating, however widely known or practised edge-sorting may have been in other casinos at the time, and however careful or careless the casino may have been to prevent it in this case,' he said. 'Hence the suggestion that the casino was acting at its own risk is irrelevant, It has no bearing on the core issue in this case, which is whether the scheme was cheating.' The case continues.

"Controversial anti-Obama billboards showing children giving the finger to President Barack Obama have sparked outrage among passing drivers. The three provocative campaign posters are on display outside a motorbike accessories store off Route 27 in Hanson, Massachusetts. One shows a little girl raising her middle finger next to the message: 'Thanks Obama. You’ve spent my lunch . money, my allowance, my inheritance, 35 years of future paychecks and my . retirement. You Jerk. Vote Mitt Romney For 2012!' Where's my lunch money? One provocative poster shows a little girl raising her middle finger and addresses the President as a 'jerk' for over-spending . Another one of the politically-charged posters, supporting Republican candidate Romney, shows a smiling President with communist hammer and sickle symbols added to his shirt collar. Beneath the picture are the words: 'Somewhere in Kenya a village is missing its idiot. Obama – One Big A** Mistake America. Vote Mitt Romney For 2012!' Eric Folsom, a father from a neighboring town, told local newspaper The Enterprise that it could put him in a difficult position when he passes by with his six-year-old daughter. 'If she saw that, she’d say ""Why is that little girl doing that? What does that mean?""' he said. 'How do I explain that?' 'Racist': Another one of the signs at the busy intersection shows Barack Obama with communist symbols on his collar and says: 'Somewhere in Kenya, a village in missing its idiot' James Brown, of Brockton, said the signs outside Sullivans Inc were racist and 'ridiculous', and showed that the U.S. as a nation 'needs to grow up.' 'I don’t know how anybody can approve of that,' said Mr Brown, a 28-year-old teacher. 'If you want to support Mitt Romney, you can put up positive messages . for Mitt Romney rather than negative slogans for Obama. That type of . statement is real redneck. It’s regressive and not progressive.' However, others found the boards amusing, honking or stopping to take pictures as they passed. Stephen McGrath, a 26-year-old naval veteran from Plymouth, said: 'People are sensitive nowadays anyway. I’ve seen (Obama portrayed) with Hitler moustaches. It’s hilarious, the funniest thing I’ve seen in a long time.' 'Bankrupt America...yes we can!' Town officials say the signs are distracting for drivers and illegal, as the store's owner has no permit to display them . The offending finger has now been covered over with packing tape and the authorities are debating whether the boards are even legal, since owner Robert Sullivan did not get a permit from the building commissioner to put them up. Town official Bob Curran said the eye-catching signs could be distracting and dangerous for pedestrians and drivers. Mr Sullivan’s lawyer, however, said he is protected under the First Amendment and that he is entitled to 'free speech'. The signs are just the latest anti-Obama displays to cause outrage. Earlier this month, a protest was staged beneath an Indiana Tea Party billboard that compared Barack Obama to Osama bin Laden. It read: 'The Navy SEALS removed one threat to America. The voters must remove the other.' Extreme tactics: The posters erected in support of Republican candidate Mitt Romney have been called offensive and ridiculous - but others find them funny .","Passing drivers were either offended or thought the poster was funny .

"A group of teenagers helped a Florida mother fight off an alleged kidnapper as he tried to snatch her four-year-old daughter and three-year-old nephew from a park playground on Saturday. 'I don't think that they realize they saved two children's lives,' Sharaya Smith said of the strangers after the frightening incident at Lisa Lake Park in New Port Richie. The 28-year-old was playing with her daughter, Tatiana, and nephew, Dante, on the equipment when Bienvenido Cintron, 34, approached her uttering strange phrases. Saviors: Sharaya Smith, 28, pictured right with her little girl, said the teens saved them from Bienvenido Cintron, left . 'I am Obama!' Cintron screamed, according to a Pasco County Sheriff's Office report. 'I have been sent by God to rid the county of drug dealers and prostitutes.' Frightened, Smith grabbed the children but the man, dressed in a dirty trench coat and jeans, with long dark hair, pushed her, causing her to lose balance, The Tamba Bay Times reported. He then tried to wrench the kids from her, grabbing at Dante's arm as he called him a drug dealer and pulling Tatiana's hair as he yelled that she was a prostitute. Smith managed to shake both children free of Cintron's clutches before running to a lit parking lot as she screamed for help. Scary: 'I don't think that they realize they saved two children's lives,' Sharaya Smith, pictured with Tatiana and an unknown man, said of the teens after the frightening incident . Close call: Tatiana Ortega, pictured, was almost kidnapped at a Florida park on Saturday . Her cries were heard by a group of teenagers, and three of the boys surrounded Smith and the children, forming a human barricade to protect them from Cintron. Smith's brother, Chad, then drove up to the park and the teenagers escorted Smith, Tatiana and Dante to his car. After they got in, Cintron circled the vehicle, demanding the toddlers open the doors and when they refused, spat on the vehicle, the Times reported. Smith said she saw the man headed for the teens as Chad sped off. But Cintron claims the teenagers beat him up. Car: The teens helped Smith, pictured center holding Tatiana and with an unknown girl, get into her brother's car . Names: The man called Tatiana, pictured, a prostitute and her cousin, Dante, 3, a drug dealer . The man called 911 to his home later that night and officers found him with two black eyes, a bloody nose and a swollen cheek, according to the Times. But police said they didn't know if the teens he accused of attacking him were the same ones from the park. Cintron was arrested just after 10 p.m. on charges of attempted kidnapping and burglary. Smith told the Times the children were shaken up after the incident, and referred to their alleged attacker as a 'bad man' who called them names. She said she wished she could thank the anonymous teens who helped her in the park.","Sharaya Smith, 28, was playing with daughter Tatiana, 4, and newphew Dante, 3, when at Lisa Lake Park in New Port Richie, Florida, at dusk on Saturday .

"The German special prosecutors' office that investigates Nazi war crimes is recommending charges against dozens of alleged former Auschwitz guards, opening the possibility of a new wave of trials almost 70 years after the end of World War II. Federal prosecutor Kurt Schrimm, the head of the office in Ludwigsburg, said an investigation of 49 suspects turned up enough evidence to recommend that state prosecutors pursue charges of accessory to murder against 30 people in Germany who were stationed at the death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. Another seven suspects who live outside the country are still being investigated, two could not be found, and one further case has already gone to prosecutors, he said. Those living abroad are in Austria, Brazil, Croatia, the U.S., Poland and even one in Israel, Schrimm said without giving further details. German Kurt Schrimm (left), head of Central Office of the Judicial Authorities of the Federal States for The Investigation of National Socialist Crimes and Rainer Stickelberger (right), Minister of Justice in German state Baden-Wuerttemberg, Ludwigsburg, Germany, today . The notorious Arbeit Macht Frei sign at the gate to  the Auschwitz Nazi concentration camp in Oswiecim, Poland . The names and hometowns of the suspects were not released. Schrimm said the oldest suspect was born in 1916 and the youngest in 1926, meaning they could range in age from 86 to 97. The cases are being sent to the responsible state prosecutors' offices in 11 of Germany's 16 states. It will be up to them to determine whether the elderly suspects - primarily men but also some women - are fit to stand trial and whether to bring official charges. ""The biggest enemy is time,"" Schrimm told reporters. Accessory to murder charges can be filed under the same legal theory that Munich prosecutors used to try former Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk, who died in a Bavarian nursing home last year while appealing his 2011 conviction on charges he served as a Sobibor death camp guard, Schrimm said. Up to his neck: Director of the Central Office of the State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes, Kurt Schrimm, stands between filing shelves in Ludwigsburg, Germany . Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk was the first person convicted in Germany solely on the basis of serving as a camp guard, with no evidence of involvement in a specific killing. Under the new legal argument, anyone who was involved in the operation of a death camp was an accessory to murder. Demjanjuk steadfastly maintained that he had been mistaken for someone else and never served as a camp guard. Efraim Zuroff, the top Nazi hunter at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem, said the decision could mean even more cases will be opened against guards at the other five main death camps established by the Nazis. Ukrainian-born John Demjanjuk, above, was the first person convicted in Germany solely on the basis of serving as a camp guard, with no evidence of involvement in a specific killing . ""We commend the (prosecutors) for seeking to apply the precedent as widely as possible and hope that they will be able to find as many perpetrators as possible,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""It's only a shame that this kind of legal reasoning was not applied previously, because it would have led to many, many more cases of people who definitely deserved to be brought to justice."" Schrimm said that even guards who worked in a death camp's kitchens played a role in the facility's function as a site that existed for the purpose of mass murder. Schrimm cautioned that the health of the suspects - and of possible witnesses - would make bringing them to trial difficult. ""I don't want to raise excessive expectations,"" he said. The Nazis built six main death camps, all in occupied Poland: Auschwitz, Belzec, Chelmno, Majdanek, Sobibor and Treblinka. The Auschwitz and Majdanek complexes also had labor camps associated with them, but Schrimm said the suspects in the current investigation all worked in the main death camp, known as Auschwitz-Birkenau. As part of the investigation prosecutors surveyed anew the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp and concluded no one could have been there for more than a day or two without learning that people were being gassed to death and their bodies incinerated at the site, he said. About 1.5 million people, primarily Jews, were killed at the Auschwitz camp complex alone between 1940 and 1945. Overall, about 6 million Jews died in the Nazi Holocaust. Schrimm's office is now focusing on the other death camps, starting with investigating all former personnel at Majdanek. He said expects to announce results of the Majdanek probe within six months.

Rainer Stickelberger (left), Minister of Justice in German state Baden-Wuerttemberg speaks next to German Kurt Schrimm (right) Investigators are also looking into former members of the so-called ""einsatzgruppen"" - death squads that were responsible for mass killings, particularly early in the war before the death camps were established, Schrimm said. He said he did not see extending the Demjanjuk precedent, however, to the Nazis' network of hundreds of concentration camps - places like Dachau, Bergen-Belsen and Buchenwald - where many tens of thousands died but whose purpose was not solely extermination. In cases of guards from those camps, prosecutors still need evidence of a specific crime in order to bring charges, he said.","Enough evidence to pursue charges of accessory to murder against 30 people in Germany who were stationed at the death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland .

"Defying odds of one-in-a-trillion, a Derby couple were shocked to find a box of six eggs which were all double-yolkers. The chances of finding just a single double-yolk egg are less than one in 1,000. But a box of six double-yolkers as John and Angela Winfield, of Breadsall, Derby, found is even more unlikely than winning the lottery. Two of the double-yolked eggs: a Derby couple were shocked to find all six eggs were double-yolkers . John, 48, was rustling up sausage, egg and chips for his wife’s tea and popped to corner shop Chyahm Food and Wine, near his home to pick up a box of eggs. When he cracked the first egg into the frying pan and saw the double yolk he couldn’t believe his luck. John said: 'My wife and I often have eggs but I’d never seen a double yolk before in all my life. John, 48, left, was rustling up sausage, egg and chips for his wife, Angie's tea and popped to corner shop Chyahm Food and Wine, near his home to pick up a box of eggs. Angie pictured right with John . 'Then I cracked another open and I . couldn’t believe it - there was another one. The odds of what was . happening kept going through my head. 'I . was really excited because I wondered whether there could be even more . double-yolkers in the box. But I didn’t dare to find out until I made . dinner again the next day.' The British Egg Information Service said the chances of one double-yolked egg are less than 0.1per cent - one in 1,000. The first double-yolked egg was a surprise, but John couldn't believe it when he cracked the next egg and it also turned out to be double-yolked . That could make the odds of finding . six in one box one in a trillion, although experts say that . double-yolked eggs come in clusters from young hens about 20-to-28 weeks old. When the first egg is double-yolked, the box is likely to contain more double-yolked eggs, they claim. John added: 'When it got down to the last one, I was so nervous that I actually dropped it. It cracked on to the kitchen floor and there was yet again another double yolk. John, pictured with his wife Angie, said after finding several eggs double-yolked: 'When it got down to the last one, I was so nervous that I actually dropped it. It cracked on to the kitchen floor and there was yet again another double yolk . 'What happened must be as unlikely as winning the lottery - although the lottery would be better, obviously. We’d probably be sitting in another country right now and not eating eggs.' John, who is a full-time carer for his wife, said: 'I love a yolk, so to have two for each egg meant they tasted great. Winning the lottery: 14,000,000 to one. Becoming an astronaut: 13,200,000 to one. Being killed by lightning: 2,320,000 to one. Being killed by a shark: 264,100,000 to one. 'Fried eggs are my favourite and I really like them runny, so it worked out well.' Angela, who suffers from osteoarthritis, was just as amazed. The 43-year-old said: 'I didn’t think these things happened anymore, so it’s very strange.' John returned to the store where he explained to shopkeeper Raj Thillay what had happened. It turned out the eggs were from a farm in Mansfield. John explained: 'Raj said he’d seen a double-yolker before but had never sold a half-dozen box of them. 'I doubt we’ll ever come across a box like that again. I think it’s just one of those things.' The odds of winning the jackpot on the National Lottery are only one in 14 million. Finding a double-yolker can often mean more than just duplicating your breakfast - as some people believe they are a sign of a marriage due to pregnancy, predictions of a windfall, the birth of twins and a death in the family. John, pictured, who is a full-time carer for his wife, said: 'I love a yolk, so to have two for each egg meant they tasted great' John Winfield said: 'I doubt we'll ever come across a box like that again. I think it's just one of those things' Double-yolked eggs almost always come from young hens about 20-to-28 weeks old, experts say . Two years ago a pack of six eggs also turned out to be double-yolkers. It happened to Jen Clarke, of the More or Less Team on Radio 4, and her friend Lynsey. As they were making profiteroles, the two friends cracked four eggs . one-by-one into a mixing bowl. The first was a double-yolker. The . second, was also a double-yolker. With a sense of anticipation they . crack the third - again a double yolker. Surely not the fourth as well? As they cracked the final egg, another double-yolker fell into the mixing bowl. It turned out the last two eggs in their box were also double-yolkers. Richard Kempsey, an agriculture director at Stonegate, which supplies . eggs to supermarkets, told BBC double-yolked eggs almost always come from . young hens about 20-to-28 weeks old. He said: 'In reality it gets its mechanics just slightly wrong. You . get a young bird and it comes to lay its first egg and it releases more . than one egg yolk. It forms a shell around the egg and out pops a rather . large egg with two egg yolks in it. 'The chances of getting a double-yolk from one of these hens is much . higher. One in every 100 eggs from these birds are double-yolk. 'We've also learned from our research that the eggs in a box . are very likely to come from the same flock, and flocks are usually . around the same age. On that basis we can say that while chance of . finding one double-yolk egg may be 1/1000, the chance of finding a . second is considerably higher - more like 1/100.' So the event that occurred in Jen's kitchen was a . billion-to-one event? Probably not, the BBC magazine wrote. There's another big factor we need . to consider - the size of the eggs. Double-yolk eggs are far more likely . to be large. Yet the eggs that young birds lay are normally small. Any large eggs that are laid would be picked out and boxed . together. This means if you find a large double-yolk egg - and you know . the other eggs in the box are from the same young flock - then the . chance that the other eggs are also double-yolkers becomes a lot more . likely. In the most extreme case, you'd find that if the first egg is a . double-yolker, all the eggs are double-yolkers. So bearing all this in mind what happened when we went back . to the last two eggs in Jen's box? Well as if to prove us right it . turned out egg five and egg six were both double-yolkers. On our initial naive reading this would be a . one-in-a-quintillion double-yolk streak. But as with most things there's . actually a more obvious explanation .","The box of eggs was bought from the local corner store while John was rustling up sausage and eggs .

"Republicans hoping to use Benghazi as a cudgel against Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she runs for President in 2016 may be out of luck, a new Fox News poll suggests. Released Wednesday, the poll asks respondents a number of questions about Clinton, including whether they think she is responsible for deaths of four Americans killed in the September 11, 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack. It also asks if they think Clinton is 'honest and trustworthy.' Despite the negative attention Clinton received throughout last year for her role in the administration's failure to prevent the deaths and it's subsequent botched response to the attack, Clinton's favorability ratings outpace those of her main 2016 rivals. Hillary Clinton gets favorable marks from Americans despite her association with the Benghazi terrorist attacks . Just over a year ago, Clinton resigned from her cabinet-level position amidst Congressional hearings into Benghazi. As if the physical attack on Benghazi wasn't bad enough, Clinton floundered in the face of Congress, shouting out the now infamous line 'what difference at this point does it make' when pressed about the cause of the attack. 'The fact is we had four dead Americans! Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they’d go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make?' Clinton said while testifying at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on January 23, 2013. 'What difference at this point does it make?' U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton infamously shouted at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 23, 2013 . Not much, it would seem. Clinton's outburst has lost much of its initial sting, based on respondent's answers to Fox's poll. While respondents do not think the Obama administration is being 'open and transparent' about the Benghazi, when directly asked if they blame Clinton for what happened, responses were mixed, with only a combined total of 55 percent of respondents placing any blame whatsoever on her. Fox's recent poll is not an anomaly. The news company's polls show that furor over Benghazi has steadily declined in the last year. During a Q and A earlier this year, Clinton acknowledged Benghazi as her 'biggest regret' during her tenure as Secretary of State, and she is expected to discuss the scandal in further detail in her upcoming memoir, Hard Choices. The book, the title of which was just released today, will hit the shelves on June 10. 'The hard questions are not, ""Do you want to be president?"" ""Can you win?"" ' Clinton said during a recent speech.'The hard questions are, ""Why? Why would you want to do this?"" and ""What? What could you offer that could make a difference?"" ' Republicans have continued to make Benghazi an issue. On Thursday, Georgia Rep. Lynn Westmoreland told a blogger for United Liberty that a group of nine House Republicans, including himself, have been reviewing congressional testimony on the attacks from various witnesses to look for 'any contradictions in testimonies.' While not expressly named by Westmoreland, Clinton's testimony is undoubtedly on the group's list to review. 'Benghazi happened on her watch, so she will always have a connection to the attack,' a former spokesperson for Clinton at state, told The Washington Times last week. 'There have been some efforts to make it about her, which I suspect will continue despite the lack of evidence.' In Fox's poll, a majority of respondents said they thought Congress should continue investigatating the Obama administration's roll in the Benghazi terrorist attack, and 61 percent said they still believe the Obama administration is engaged in a cover-up. The percentage of Americans who believe the administration is lying about Benghazi remains steadfast, but the percentage who believe Congress should continue its investigation has significantly decreased since June of last year. Then, 73 percent of respondents wanted Congress to continue 'until lawmakers feel they know the truth.'Now, only 60 percent say the same thing. The poll surveyed roughly the same number of Republicans and Democrats and it contained similar percentages of both compared to previous Fox News polls on these issues. In a potential match up against New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, two politicians who ranked highest on Republican respondents' 2016 wish list, Clinton would beat both by a solid eight to nine points, the poll found. On the issue of trust, 54 percent said Clinton was 'honest and trustworthy' compared with Christie, who has taken a public relations flogging in recent months over the Bridgegate scandal, whom only 41 percent said they trusted. Jeb Bush didn't fare much better, with only 49 percent giving him positive marks in the trust category. Clinton's favorability rating is at its lowest point since 2008, but she she outpaced President Barack Obama, Jeb Bush and high-profile Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, two more likely 2016 candidates. 'Polls don't matter much at all right now - what's most important is that there are millions of Americans in all corners of the country who are ready to help her win if she decides to run,' Ready for Hillary communications director Seth Bringman told MailOnline in an email. 'Poll numbers could change, but the enthusiasm of her supporters and the list of grassroots supporters can only grow.' While it's still early to be making blanket statements about the 2016 presidential election, it's clear that Benghazi won't have the thrust Republicans hoped it would. Should Clinton decide to run, Republicans will need to find a fresh angle on the issue to attack Clinton from or dig up new dirt.","Fox News poll released this week that asked various questions about the Benghazi terrorist attack and the 2016 presidential race.
Clinton's favorability remains high despite Americans' contempt for the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi terrorist attack.
Americans are mixed on whether to hold Clinton directly responsible.
A majority of respondents said Clinton was 'honest and trustworthy.'
The poll found that Clinton is better liked than her potential 2016 rivals ."
"A young Chinese woman has appeared to document on Instagram the final moments before she committed suicide by jumping out of her high-rise apartment window. 'I will haunt you day and night after I'm dead,' jojostai1012, from Shanghai, told her ex-boyfriend on the photo-sharing app before uploading a shot of a pile of her belongings burning and another of her legs dangling perilously out a window with a carpark many stories below.

Tragic: This young Chinese woman has appeared to document on Instagram her final moments before she committed suicide by jumping out her high-rise apartment window . The shape of the carpark resembles the one seen beneath her feet in the picture she uploaded and, according to the DailyDot, a person claiming to be her neighbor confirmed the suicide in a comment. 'This is real, we live in the same building, she died Saturday morning,' the person wrote. 'No matter what, how much courage must it have taken for a little girl to kill herself? Hope she will find peace in the afterlife.' Another man, claiming to be her friend, mourned her loss online, and posted a screen shot of a text message conversation he appeared to have had with the girl earlier, where she told him she was 'going to leave.' Ashes: The girl posted a photograph, seen here, of a pile of her belongings going up in flames with the caption, 'Let it burn, all the things like ashes float away' The sorry story began about two weeks . ago, when the young woman started posting photos with worrying captions . detailing her devastation at a recent break up. Instead of raising the alarm and potentially saving her life, her . followers simply liked the pictures or wrote shallow comments . underneath. 'Life has been so miserable these . past few days,' she wrote alongside one picture. 'I want to forget all . of this, to control my mood and not be crying painfully late at night . every night, but I can’t do it, there’s nothing I can do. All of this is . too unfair to me, I can't bear it.' Next to a picture of a young man, presumably her ex, she wrote: 'I never thought that you'd deceive me, but I still love you.' Deceit: Next to a picture of this young man, presumably her ex, she wrote: 'I never thought that you'd deceive me, but I still love you' Sad: The girl wrote next to this picture, 'I will haunt you day and night after I'm dead' She . then piled her possessions on her bed and set them alight, with the . caption 'Let it burn, all the things like ashes float away.' She writes how since the break up, . which happened at the beginning of March, she has been . unable to eat or sleep and cries all the time. She . says she has gone out with other guys who are more handsome and wealthy . than her ex but 'my heart is unable to accept anyone else.' The . young girl then asks why he rejected her after giving her so much hope . and making so many promises, which later turned out to be 'a lie.' No support: Despite the sheer level of devastation in the captions, most of the comments provide little support for the beautiful girl;, pictured . 'All of this I cannot forget, can never forget, unless I die,' she wrote. Despite the sheer level of devastation in the captions, most of the comments provide little support and it seems that no one flagged up her unstable state to someone who could help. Though her friend and neighbor appear to have confirmed the suicide, it's impossible to tell whether it occurred or if the story is a hoax because the woman hasn't been named and there are no reports of a similar suicide in the Shanghai media.

"Created: . 04:08 EST, 19 March 2014 . A Cambridge University college was forced to drop plans for a Beautiful South-themed ball after concerns were raised over racism by a student. St Edmund's College had planned to theme its annual summer ball around the contemporary southern United States. However, organisers decided to abandon their original plans, and instead re-brand the event the Journey Through The Seasons. Diverse: Founded in 1896, St Edmund's prides itself as being one of the most diverse colleges at the University . Founded in 1896, St Edmund's prides itself as being one of the most diverse colleges at the University, with students coming from over fifty different countries. St Edmund's Student Mamusu Kallon, who was born in Sierra Leone, initially claimed to The Independent that the ball was to be themed around the Pulitzer Prize winning novel, 'Gone with the Wind, saying: . 'It is a film that glamourises the romantic dreams of a slave owner . and a KKK member while rendering the horrors of slavery invisible.' 'The black characters fulfil every derogatory racist stereotype of the ""slave"" and black people continue to be subject to the modern-day versions of . these stereotypes.' In fact, 'Gone with the Wind' was just one of several literary works briefly considered at a closed meeting of the organising committee as a means of making the contemporary US south theme more 'eye catching'. Organisers unanimously selected 'The Beautiful South' (the band of that name had been contacted to play at the ball), believing literary works to be too contentious. Miss Kallon was not a member of the ball committee. The decision to change the theme of the annual May Ball from 'The Beautiful South' to 'Journey Through the Seasons' was made by organisers last month. A website advertising the ball states: 'We are pleased to announce the theme for St Edmund's May Ball 2014 is ""Journey Through the Seasons"". 'Experience . all four seasons in one memorable night; our college grounds will evoke . fruitful autumn gardens, long midwinter nights, the early hours of . spring and the fierce passion of midsummer. 'Expect scorching heat and wild storms throughout this explosive May Ball.' Last year the event was themed around the 1920s set F. Scott Fitzgerald novel The Great Gatsby. A St Edmund's College spokesman said: 'The college felt that it . would have only been necessary for it to intervene formally if the . matter had not been resolved satisfactorily. 'The college supports the . change of theme and is proud of its record of friendliness and . cordiality.' A Cambridge University spokesman said that the issue was a 'college matter', and he was unable to comment. Last . week members of Cambridge's Black and Minority Ethnic committee ran the . 'I, Too, Am Cambridge, campaign calling on students to speak out about . racial discrimination on campus. During the campaign committee members . invited students to be photographed holding up a whiteboard proclaiming a . message about their experiences as a means to raise awareness of the . issues facing ethnic minority students. The . campaign also aims to promote engagement with the BME issues amongst . the student body. Vice President  stressed that students need not self . identify as belonging to an ethnic minority in order to engage with the . BME campaign.'I want students to feel interested in what we have . to say, and even though it does not affect them directly understand . that it affects their friends or people they know,' BME Vice President Millie Ngage told Varsity.","St Edmund's College had planned to theme its May Ball around the contemporary southern United States .

"The Luxembourg government today resigned, brought down by a spying and corruption scandal that shook the tiny country better known for wealthy bankers than political intrigue. Jean-Claude Juncker, prime minister since 1995 and the European Union's longest serving government chief, tendered his resignation to Grand Duke Henri, the royal head of state who himself has been implicated in media reports of espionage. The government was forced to resign after junior coalition partners withdrew their support in protest at Juncker's apparent failure to rein in a secret service spiralling out of control. Juncker has proposed holding a general election in October, seven months ahead of schedule. Accused: Grand Duke Henri (left) was implicated in espionage reports that led to the downfall of Juncker (right) The catalyst for the resignation was a parliamentary inquiry published last week that said Luxembourg's security agency illegally bugged politicians and members of the public, purchased cars for private use and took payments and favours in exchange for access to influential officials. In a scene reminiscent of a spy novel, former security chief Marco Mille recorded a conversation with Juncker in 2008 using a microphone in his watch. Mille told Juncker he had reliable reports that Grand Duke Henri was in constant contact with Britain's secret services, according to one newspaper. The Grand Duke's office has denied the allegation. The government was already under pressure due to renewed interest in a mysterious series of sabotage bomb attacks in the 1980s, known as the Bommeleeer affair, whose targets included electricity pylons and an airport radar system as well as a newspaper office. Two former members of a special police force went on trial for the attacks at the start of this year. Last month, the government and Finance Minister Luc Frieden survived twin votes of no-confidence in parliament over accusations that the minister had put pressure on investigators to close their inquiry into the bombings. Juncker, for almost two decades the personification of Luxembourg on the international stage, chairing ""Eurogroup"" meetings of euro zone finance ministers from 2005 to 2013, may well return to lead the Grand Duchy after the snap election. He remains a popular figure and has no obvious successor in his centre-right CSV party, particularly as the former finance minister has been tarnished, according to Philippe Poirier, politics lecturer at the University of Luxembourg. Frieden, once touted as a possible future prime minister, has also come under fire over the re-purchase of a stake in Cargolux from Qatar Airways in January and European Union pressure to end Luxembourg's system of bank secrecy. ""The CSV crown price for many years, Luc Frieden, is himself involved in the telephone tapping and Bommeleeer affairs,"" Poirier said. ""Jean Claude Juncker is the electoral locomotive of his party. It's not the CSV, it's the Juncker party.""","Jean-Claude Juncker was Europe's longest-serving leader, with 18 years as prime minister .

"Wilson Palacios stares at the ground and rarely looks up for half an hour. Conversations about the kidnap and murder of his youngest brother are a dreadful necessity in his life. ‘Things must change,’ he says. ‘We have to deal with these gangs.’ And that is why he talks. He speaks slowly and quietly to a translator. Across a long and painful discussion with Sportsmail, he will relive the nightmare of Edwin’s kidnapping by gangs in Honduras in 2007, the failed ransom exchange, the silence and the discovery of Edwin’s body 19 months later. Wilson Palacios took time to speak to Sportsmail about the kidnapping ordeal that changed his life . Palacios' brother was taken in 2007, and later murdered by a gang of kidnappers . He will also reveal for the first time that this ordeal was followed by a second kidnapping, when his sister-in-law and two nephews were taken hostage for a week in 2012. ‘There was no ransom paid that time,’ he says. ‘The police were getting close and we got my sister-in-law and nephews back after a week.’ He adds: ‘It is uncomfortable to talk about but I must because I want people to understand.’ The gang situation in Honduras is critical and Palacios believes the terrible details of stories like his – awfully common in Honduras – can help spread awareness and draw support. It is why he has requested this interview and why he has joined Kenco’s campaign to lure the teenagers of his homeland away from gangs and into coffee farming. Palacios moved to England in 2007, playing first for Birmingham, and then latterly for Stoke (pictured) The Honduran footballer has not only had to deal with one kidnapping - in 2012 his sister-in-law and two nephews were also taken for a fortnight . ‘I lived in La Ceiba and there is a gang there – 18th Street Gang - which is very active and one of the biggest gangs in central America,’ he says. ‘A lot of my friends ended up being part of it. They ended up there because there were no opportunities for these young people. No work, or hope - nothing. It was the easiest opportunity for a lot of people.’ In the context of a UN report from this year, Honduras has by far the world’s highest murder rate and 60 per cent of their population live below the poverty line. It’s a country through which 70 per cent of the US’s cocaine passes and is home to an estimated 36,000 young gang members. Palacios says: ‘Lots of my friends from school ended up like this. They had either been forced to join a gang or did it voluntarily because there was no other opportunity for them. A lot of them are dead now. ‘Often when friends disappeared for long periods of time, we would ask “Where is he?” It would become clear that they were in a gang or dead. ‘I had a stable, middle-class family. My father was a factory manager and my mother was a teacher. And I had football as a passion and possibility. If I didn’t it might have gone differently.’ Palacios challenges Stewart Downing to the ball during a Premier League match for Wigan in January 2008 . When his brother was kidnapped, Palacios and his family paid a ransom reported to be around £330,000 . The gang entered his life in October 2007, just months after the publicity of Palacios’s big opportunity in England. One of five brothers, four of whom became professional footballers, he left Honduras aged 23 for a trial at Arsenal. Then, on the back of Arsene Wenger’s endorsement, he was given a six-month trial at Birmingham. ‘My family were not particularly wealthy but because the gang perceived them to be wealthy they targeted them,’ he says. ‘It happened three months into my trial at Birmingham.’ Five gunmen broke into the family home, tied up Palacios’s parents and took Edwin, the youngest brother at 15, from his room. ‘I was training one morning and I remember very clearly,’ Palacios says. ‘I suddenly had a strange feeling in my gut. Palacios played for Wigan between 2008 and 2009, pictured here (right) tackling Emmanuel Adebayor . From Wigan, Palacios moved to Tottenham for £12 million, where he stayed until August 2011 . ‘I went to the dressing room and turned on my phone and saw I had missed a call from my older brother. I called and he told me our brother (Edwin) had been kidnapped. He said I had to stay calm. I said I am coming home but he thought that might make it worse. ‘I stayed but a month later I couldn’t deal with it and had to leave. I asked Steve Bruce for permission and he let me. I stayed there in Honduras for three months and negotiated with the kidnappers. ‘Negotiations lasted a year. They would put my brother on the phone. It was so hard. But we paid the ransom after a year and then we heard nothing.’ The ransom is reported to have been approximately £330,000. Palacios says: ‘My family went to a spot to pick him up – I was back in England by then. The kidnappers told us to drop the money and they would release him. We left the money but they never released him. My family waited for hours.’ In England, Palacios had followed Bruce from Birmingham to Wigan and then on to Tottenham for £12m in 2009. Palacios (left) challenges Man City's Javier Garrido in September 2008 . Palacios (right) challenges Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher in a Premier League match . ‘I played on without knowing what had happened to my brother,’ he says. ‘One day the police got in touch and told us they had possibly found the body. I was about to play an important game (away at Everton) in 2009 and I had to come back to Honduras.’ The call had come at 1am on May 9 and he waited in the team hotel’s lobby for six hours until Harry Redknapp was awake to ask permission to leave. Redknapp was left speechless by the gesture. Palacios has since rebuilt his life, naming his three-year-old son after his late brother. He revealed he went through the nightmare of a kidnapping again two years ago when his brother Jerry’s wife and their two sons were taken but released. Palacios’s career has hit a bump, though. The 30-year-old has not appeared for Stoke since playing at the World Cup in the summer and plans to leave in January. Palacios played at the World Cup in the summer for Honduras, pictured (left) against France on June 15 . Palacios, now at Stoke, has struggled to find first-team football under Mark Hughes and will look to move on . ‘In January I will be looking at other teams, hopefully in London,’ he says. ‘I think the team is doing well, but when the trainer (Mark Hughes) does not see eye to eye with someone it is difficult to play. I have no issues with the manager, this is just how football is sometimes. ‘There is not a lot I can do about it.’ The gang situation, or so he hopes, is a different matter. He runs his own initiatives at home and is paid no money to endorse Kenco’s campaign and relive awful memories. ‘Talking about what happened to my family is hard,’ he says. ‘But it is OK if it helps stop this problem that I know so well. Things must change.’ For more information on Kenco’s campaign, visit www.coffeevsgangs.com .","Wilson Palacios was born in Honduras, and has played football in England since 2007, when he joined Birmingham after a trial .

"Parents and grandparents should be able to use their pensions to help their children get on the housing ladder, Nick Clegg suggested yesterday. The ‘pension for property’ plan aims to let those approaching retirement borrow against the lump sum payment in their pension to underwrite the mortgages of young people who cannot afford to buy a home. Up to a quarter of a pension pot can be paid out in a lump sum when someone retires. Pensions-for-property: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg says young people need help to buy a home. The idea is that the cash would not . actually leave their fund but be used as a ‘guarantee’ that the . house-buyer would repay the home loan. The relative would lose the money . only if the loan repayments were not made. The Deputy Prime Minister revealed the . plans in an attempt to show that the Government is helping people who . have worked hard but cannot afford to give their own children a helping . hand. But the plans rapidly began to unravel . last night as it became clear that only a small minority of families . would be able to take advantage of them. Critics said they were a ‘gimmick’ which would apply only to the well-off who can afford to risk losing . some of the money they have saved to finance their retirement. Former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell (pictured) today called for an end to ‘gossip’ about Nick Clegg’s future at the helm of the party. Mr Clegg was again dogged by rumours of plots against him today, with Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, and party president Tim Farron, said to be favourites from the left of the party, while Ed Davey, the Energy Secretary, emerged as the standard bearer of the Lib Dem right. A poll of Lib Dem members by website LibDemVoice revealed his personal rating has fallen below zero for the first time, to minus 2 per cent. But Sir Menzies, who was ousted as leader weeks after a doomed party conference in 2007, today tried to end the speculation.‘I think this scuttlebutt, this gossip should be put to rest once and for all,’ he told PoliticsHome. ‘If you are serious about the kind of things we’ve been discussing today, then the person who is best qualified to take us forward is Nick Clegg. ‘I am unequivocal in my support for him and so too should you be and so too should members of Parliament and, indeed, the people in the House of Lords as well,"" he told a fringe event at the party conference in Brighton. Jo Swinson, a former aide to Mr Clegg promote to become a business minister in the reshuffle, insisted there was no question of her colleagues rounding on their leader. ‘Absolutely not. The parliamentary party sees the job that Nick is doing very, very skilfully in government.’ Matt Chorley, MailOnline political editor . The Liberal Democrat leader told the . BBC’s Andrew Marr: ‘At the moment we’ve got thousands of young people . who are desperate to get their feet on the first rung of the property . ladder, but deposits have doubled, and the number of young people who . are asking help from family members to get a mortgage has doubled. ‘The Government is going to do . something which hasn’t happened before - we’re going to work out ways in . which parents and grandparents [can] help their children and . grandchildren buy a property of their own.’ Mr Clegg’s aides said there are . currently 250,000 households in Britain today where someone has a . pension pot worth around £40,000, the minimum sum that would be needed . to take advantage of the scheme. But experts were swift to point out . that millions of others would not have the chance to help out because . their pension pots are too small. The average pot is just £26,000. Following talks with pension and . mortgage providers the Lib Dems admitted that only around 12,500 . families would be likely to take up the offer. Dr Ros Altmann, director general of . over-50s financial group Saga and a former Downing Street pensions . adviser, said: ‘This looks like a political gimmick. ‘I’m afraid this sounds like a scheme for kids of relatively well-off parents or grandparents. ‘Most people do not have that much . money in their pension scheme, and just pledging their lump sum to their . offspring is hardly likely to solve the problem of unaffordably high . house prices.’ Joanne Segars, chief executive of the National . Association of Pension Funds, also questioned whether the scheme would . work. ‘At first glance this idea leaves us . feeling slightly uneasy,’ she said. ‘This policy could end up leaving . retirees out of pocket. The UK already has a serious problem with people . saving too little for their old age. ‘The Government has already looked at . letting people have early access to their pensions and decided it . against it. People need to keep their pension for their retirement, . especially with rising longevity and the costs of long-term care.’ The Association of British Insurers . said it would examine the details more closely but echoed those . concerns. Director general Otto Thoresen warned: ‘Pensions are designed . to mature into a decent retirement income, not for other purposes.’ Adam Marshall of the British Chambers . of Commerce said: ‘It sounds like robbing Peter to pay Paul. Employers . pay into pensions too, and would be unhappy to see money used this way.’","Liberal Democrat leader reveals plant to let parents and grandparents use pension funds to guarantee mortgage deposits for first time buyers .

"CIA Director-designate John Brennan's vigorous defense of drone strikes to kill terror suspects - even American citizens - overseas is causing lawmakers to consider lifting secrecy from the drone program and push to regulate its use. Brennan, President Barack Obama's top counter terror adviser, was grilled for more than three hours Thursday before the Senate Intelligence Committee on the drone program he leads and on leaks of classified information to the media, which Brennan vehemently denied being a part of. Despite Brennan's wide-ranging testimony and the White House's release of a top secret memo explaining its legal rationale for the strikes just hours before the confirmation hearing began, some senators afterward said it was time to bring the drone program into the open. Scroll down for video . In the hot seat: John Brennan addressed a number of issues- including the drone strikes- at the hearing . Protests: Brennan was interrupted repeatedly by people protesting the drone strikes . In a hearing that was marred by . anti-drone protests that brought it to a brief halt at the outset, . Brennan told the committee that missile strikes by the unmanned drones . are used only against targets planning to carry out attacks against the . United States, never as retribution for an earlier one. 'Nothing could be further from the truth,' he declared. Referring to one American citizen . killed by a drone in Yemen in 2011, he said Anwar al-Awlaki had ties to . at least three attacks planned or carried out on U.S. soil. They . included the Fort Hood, Texas, shooting that claimed 13 lives in 2009, a . failed attempt to down a Detroit-bound airliner the same year and a . thwarted plot to bomb cargo planes in 2010. 'He was intimately involved in activities to kill innocent men women and children, mostly Americans,' Brennan said. Clear message: A secret drone report was shared with the Senators at the hearing following a leak earlier this week . After the hearing the committee's chairwoman, Democratic . Sen Dianne Feinstein said she wanted . to make the program more open to the public so U.S. officials can . acknowledge the strikes and correct 'exaggerated' reports of civilian casualties. Sen Feinstein said she and other senators . were considering legislation to set up a special court system to . regulate drone strikes, similar to the one that signs off on government . surveillance in espionage and terrorism cases. Brennan said drones are only used on targets planning attacks on the U.S. - never as retribution . Speaking with uncharacteristic . openness about the classified program, Sen Feinstein said the CIA had . allowed her staff to make more than 30 visits to the agency's northern . Virginia headquarters to monitor strikes but that such transparency . needed to be increased. Her comments came after the White House, under . pressure from the committee, gave senators on the panel a Justice . Department memo outlining the legal justification for drone strikes. But . senators complained that their staff wasn't allowed to see it. 'I think the process set up internally . is a solid process,' Feinstein said of the methods used to decide when . to launch drones and against whom, but added: 'I think there's an . absence of knowing exactly who is responsible for what decision. So I . think we need to look at this whole process and figure a way to make it . transparent and identifiable.' Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, a member . of the House Intelligence Committee, said his panel also had been . looking at establishing a 'court-like entity' to review the strikes. 'I think the House and Senate ought to . put their heads together and come up with some way to require either . initially or after the fact, a review of an operation when it takes the . life of an American citizen,' Mr Schiff said. Under oath: The hearings were watched even more closely because of the recently-leaked memo about the use of drones, as Brennan is thought to have been the 'architect' of the program . Next step: Brennan is a veteran of more than three decades in intelligence work, and most recently served as Obama's top counter-terrorism adviser in the White House . In a long afternoon in the witness . chair, Brennan was questioned on other issues, such as the use of . waterboarding and other interrogation techniques in the George W. Bush . administration. He declined to say whether he believes . waterboarding, . which simulates drowning, amounted to torture, but he said firmly it was . 'something that is reprehensible and should never be done again.' Brennan, 57, is a veteran of more than . three decades in intelligence work. He withdrew his name from . nomination to head the CIA four years ago amid questions about the role . he played at the CIA when the Bush administration approved waterboarding . and other forms of 'enhanced interrogation' of suspected terrorists. More common: Fewer than 50 strikes took place during the Bush administration while more than 360 strikes have been launched under Obama . On the question of waterboarding, . Brennan said that while serving as a deputy manager at the CIA during . the Bush administration, he was told such interrogation methods produced 'valuable information.' Targets: Strikes are carried out in Yemen, where three American citizens with al Qaeda connections have been killed including Anwar al-Awlaki (pictured in 2008) Now, after reading a 300-page summary of a . 6,000-page report on CIA interrogation and detention policies, he said . he does 'not know what the truth is.' Brennan bristled once . when he was questioned about leaks to the media about an al-Qaida plot . to detonate a new type of underwear bomb on a Western airline. Republican Sen James Risch accused . him of having leaked classified information in a telephone call with . former government officials who were preparing to make television . appearances to explain the plot. 'I disagree with that vehemently,' the nominee shot back. On May 7 of last year the CIA thwarted an ambitious plot by al-Qaida's . affiliate in Yemen to destroy a U.S.-bound airliner, using a bomb with a . sophisticated new design. The bombing would have taken place near the . anniversary of the killing by U.S. Navy SEALs of Osama bin Laden. The . next day, The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times reported that the . would-be bomber was cooperating with U.S. authorities. Time to talk: The hearing was led by Senator Dianne Feinstein (right) and Brennan (left) had to answer legal questions about the use of drones . Risch and Sen Dan Coats of Indiana . were among those who contended Brennan inadvertently had revealed that . the U.S. had a spy inside Yemen's al-Qaida branch when, hours after the . first report appeared, he told a group of media consultants 'there was . no active threat during the bin Laden anniversary because ... we had inside control of the plot.' Brennan won praise from several members of the committee as the day's proceedings drew to a close. 'I think you're the guy for the job, and the only guy for the job,' said Democratic Sen Jay Rockefeller. The panel will meet in closed session next week to discuss classified material.","Adviser John Brennan said drones only used on targets planning attacks .

"England's ultimate vision for this trip involved a series victory, powerful momentum and answers. Instead, they will arrive home pondering a 3-0 Black-wash, a telling psychological setback and so many lingering questions. A tour that promised so much eventually left the national team with little to show for their brave efforts. They departed on Sunday in various shattered contingents, minus the results they craved on the scoreboard and in terms of forward planning. England couldn’t emphatically tick the boxes marked ‘present’ or ‘future’. Stuart Lancaster is renowned for the glass-half-full attitude that he brings to his work, but the head coach was understandably dejected on Sunday. With the World Cup countdown in mind, he and his assistants had desperately hunted the landmark win which would have added clout to the notion that England are re-emerging as a global force in good time for their home tournament next year. Instead, there were three defeats and the last of them was an unseemly rout. VIDEO New Zealand complete series whitewash . Questions: Chris Robshaw is helpless as Julian Savea scores a try during the tour that disappointed . Marched: Billy Vunipola walks off the field after being shown a yellow card in England's 36-13 third Test lost . Failure to stop the All Black juggernaut in these parts is no cause for humiliation, given the annual procession of challengers who come here infused with hope, only to retreat with tails between legs. In a historical context, this was progress of sorts. But England also sought sign-posts to guide them on their way to the World Cup and instead they wound up driving into a dense fog. For now, confusion has won the tussle with clarity. Lancaster and his assistants are seemingly no nearer to knowing the identity of their best line-up. If anything, there is more doubt than there was when the extended squad left home in dribs and drabs. Circumstances have been cruel in conspiring against selection continuity – contributing to the merry-go-round procession of contenders moving in and out of certain positions. The next time England are in action is November and their next opponents are the same world champions who have tormented them this month. Putting aside the small matter of injury disruption, New Zealand are bound to have a reassuringly familiar look at Twickenham, whereas the make-up of the home side is anyone’s guess. In summary, the pack is taking shape, but the back-line remains a morass of dilemmas. Lancaster conceded as much as he presented an over-view of the selection out-look. ‘Once you get the front-rowers back, we’ve got more depth there now,’ he said, referring to the absent Alex Corbisiero, Dan Cole, Mako Vunipola and Tom Youngs. ‘Robb Webber has done really well. Matt Mullan and Kieran Brookes have been bonuses on this tour. Second row-wise, I think Ed Slater has pushed his case forward and losing Geoff Parling for the third Test was quite a hammer-blow in hindsight. ‘In the back row, Ben Morgan was a huge positive and Tom Wood again showed consistency at the highest level. With Kvesic’s performance (against the Crusaders) I’m hoping that is going to back itself up next season. We will have Tom Croft back in the equation as well. ‘Going through the backs, there are more decisions still to be made, no doubt about it. Centre-wise, we had a consistent partnership during the Six Nations and they played well. It was a difficult task for Billy Twelvetrees having been out for so long. Brad Barritt was excellent in that Crusaders game so he will come back in the equation. But I would still suggest wing is the position really where… there’s not many Julian Saveas running around!’ Hat-trick hero: Julian Savea races through to complete a 36-13 victory for New Zealand in third test . Different class: Aaron Smith, Ma'a Nonu and Aaron Cruden celebrate during New Zealand's third victory . The mention of England’s try-scoring . nemesis was apt. Savea has touched down eight times in four matches . against his favourite victims. What Lancaster would give for such a . consistently prolific and powerful attacking weapon. One primary problem . for the tourists in this series was an inability to match their rivals’ clinical precision when presented with scoring chances. Another issue . was lapses in English intensity levels – extending to 10 minutes in . Auckland, 20 minutes in Dunedin and an entire half at Waikato Stadium on . Saturday, suggesting they regressed in that regard. An . area of simmering concern is the breakdown, where England simply could . not compete with the Kiwis in the crucial business of poaching . turn-overs and denying their rivals quick ball. Chris Robshaw delivered . an heroic, dominant performance in Auckland, but the management . continued to highlight the fact that as an open-side, they expect more . from their captain at the ruck. Lancaster pointedly praised . Robshaw’s nominal under-study, Kvesic, for his display in the mid-week . win and urged the Gloucester flanker to relentlessly challenge the . skipper and create a selection conundrum. ‘We need more competition at . No 7,’ he said. ‘Absolutely. I’m unequivocal in my mind in that regard. Brace:  Julian Savea scored two tries as New Zrealand raced to a 29-6 half-time lead . Whiteash: New Zealand completed a Test whitewash and equalled their record of 17 consecutive Test wins . ‘Matt . Kvesic delivered a performance against the Crusaders which was exactly . the same as the performance he delivered in Argentina a year ago. The . problem is we’re not seeing that level of performance in a Gloucester . shirt. I’m hoping he’ll bottle that, the new coaching staff at . Gloucester will get the best out of him and he’ll remain that consistent . presence at the breakdown.’ There are other questions up front, but . an overall sense of making adjustments from a position of strength, . while the same cannot be said of the situation behind the scrum. At this . stage, the only apparent certainty is that Owen Farrell remains a man . apart as the first-choice No 10 and fulcrum of the entire back-line. ‘Missing Owen is a big loss to your team’s energy,’ said Lancaster of . the injured Saracen. ‘He is a great leader.’ Mike Brown is surely . nailed-on in the team for the time being and Manu Tuilagi proved that he . must be viewed solely as a midfield force of nature, but beyond that . there is only doubt – about personnel and the finer points of the . game-plan. Depending on who starts, England are still searching for the . balance between playing fast-and-loose or falling back on a . kick-and-bash approach. On the whole, there is far greater . depth now in most positions, with the likes of Anthony Watson and Ed . Slater among the fringe candidates making a compelling push for World . Cup inclusion. But on the flip-side, others who came here may not be . seen again. It will soon be time for clarity to chase confusion out of . town and for England to start winning these major matches, or they will . not be happy guests at their own party next year. Black-wash!

"A Pennsylvania mother who gave birth to her son at 19 weeks posted her story and photographs on her blog to share with friends and family, but her brave choice has spread way beyond her immediate circle to bring comfort to other grieving mothers. Alexis Fretz was 30 years old and 19 weeks pregnant with her third child when she began bleeding lightly. Not overly worried, she called her midwife and as a precaution was advised to head to the ER in a Kokomo, Indiana hospital for a check-up. By the end of the day, her son Walter had been born and died in her arms. WARNING: DISTRESSING CONTENT . Perfectly formed: Alexis Fretz holds the tiny hand of her son Walter . Precious moments: Fretz holds her son, who was born after she went into labor while only 19 weeks pregnant . Fretz had no inkling that the day, which began with a pedicure and lunch with a friend and bride-to-be whose wedding she was supposed to photograph the following day, would end in such devastating loss. In a waiting room in the hospital, Fretz was given three glasses of water to drink in preparation for an ultrasound. Soon after, she began to feel the first twinges of pain. A few minutes after 6pm, 'I knew I was in labor, there was no doubt in my mind,' wrote Fretz on her blog. Nurses were sceptical and she was finally taken for her ultrasound at 7pm. Fretz felt heartened when the technician found a heartbeat, but soon her bleeding increased and the pain of her contractions intensified. Taken too soon: Walter's tiny heart was still beating as his mother and father said their goodbyes . Closure: Joshua Fretz and his wife Alexis say being able to hold their son and say goodbye has helped their healing process . The ultrasound technician told her husband when Fretz was out of the room, 'I’m sorry, and I don’t want her to see me crying, but I will be praying for you.' 'At this point there was no break between the contractions. Just as one finished another would start. I knew that I was at the end. I didn't give up hope, but in my heart of hearts, I knew that I was losing my baby. 'At some point the PA came in and said ""your foetus is still viable."" I seriously wanted to slap her. When the doctor checked me and sat down beside me on the bed and told me that we were going to be delivering our baby, it was the first that anyone had called him a baby. 'I immediately started bawling and asking if there was any other option,' she wrote. Walter Joshua Fretz was born at 9:42pm. Family: The Fretzes also wanted their two daughters to be able to farewell their longed-for brother . Discussion: Alexis Fretz says pre-term labor and miscarriage aren't spoken about and many women are not given an opportunity to grieve after losing a baby early in pregnancy . 'I was crying so hard at this point but he was perfect. He was fully formed and everything was there, I could see his heart beating in his tiny chest,' wrote Fretz.At some point, Fretz's husband Joshua went to her car and retrieved the camera she was going to shoot her friend's wedding on and took photographs of the couple's first son.'I am so very glad that Joshua [did that]. At first I did not want any photos, but they are the only thing I have to look back on now,' Fretz wrote.'I held him, cuddled him, while his heart was beating I held him to my heart, I counted his toes and kissed his tiny head. I will always cherish those memories that I have of him.' Beloved son: Fretz says the term 'fetus' is insulting, and that her son was a baby, even though he was so tiny . Fretz shared the confronting yet touching images not to cause controversy, but to open up discussion about a tragedy that affects more than 1 million American women each year: pre-term labor.'Pre-term labour and infant loss is not something the public wants to talk about,' says Fretz. 'To most people it's not a big deal, you just try again for another baby, so they pretend it never happened and go on with their lives while the mother and family are left in a pile of grief they don't know how to deal with. Memories: Photographs and memories are all the Fretzes have left of Walter . 'It is also very common for medical staff to take these babies away and dispose of them as medical waste, so many mothers never get to see or hold their babies, or even know if it was a boy or a girl.' Fretz says she's had many emails from women who have experienced miscarriage and for whom her words and pictures helped to bring healing. 'I’m still in shock at how much his photos have been shared and commented on. In his short life of just a few minutes he has touched more lives then I ever could have imagined,' said Fretz.","Alexis Fretz went into labor when she was just 19 weeks pregnant .

"In trouble: Attorney James Owen faces losing his license for an affair with the wife of a client . An Ohio attorney is fighting to keep his license after admitting to having an affair with his client's wife before, during and after the trial that found him guilty of murder. At a disciplinary hearing on Tuesday, James D. Owen said his affair with Celeste Caulley at the time of the 1997 trial was a 'betrayal of trust' and went against 'every principle' he stood for. He admitted that he even had sex with Caulley the night her husband Robert was convicted of murdering his parents, Lois and Charles. He was later sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. Owen, 59, insisted that he had fought hard for his client, but when he finally admitted to the affair years later, a judge called for a new trial, ruling that the attorney had been 'distracted'. The lawyer ended the relationship in 1998 and then told his wife, son, parents and in-laws. Court documents said that the affair finished when he refused to leave his wife. He then waited 14 years before telling . anyone else about the affair, which involved him having sex with Caulley in his office, at hotels and in a cabin, the Columbus Dispatch reported. 'I . couldn't bring myself to do it,' he told the Ohio Supreme Court Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline. 'I felt like I had fallen off a cliff . into a deep hole and didn't know how to get out of it.' Violation of trust: Owen, right, shakes hands with Robert Caulley in 1997, when he was convicted of killing his parents in 1994. He has been granted a re-trial since it emerged Owen was having an affair with his wife . He has been a practicing attorney for 34 years but he could lose his . law license or have it suspended if he is found guilty of violating . noncriminal rules of professional conduct. The . panel will report its findings to the full board, which will then make a . recommendation to the Supreme Court. A final ruling is not likely until . early next year, the Dispatch reported. After the affair was uncovered in 2011, . Ohio Public Defender Tim Young was granted a new trial for Caulley based . on Owen’s improper relationship with his wife. 'He had been distracted to an extent . that greatly hindered his preparation and trial performance,' Judge John . Martin said, agreeing to a new trial. 'Counsel spent inordinate amounts of time with Celeste and shunned the rest of his investigators and . assistants, leading to mistakes.' Robert Caulley, a former auronatical engineer, maintains he had nothing to do with death of his parents, who were found stabbed to death after a botched robbery in 1994, and claims that he was coerced into giving a confession. Torn: Celeste Caulley reacts to his guilty plea in 1997 - but she went on to have sex with his lawyer in a hotel that night. She has now said that she believes her former husband was innocent . His DNA was never found on the murder weapon. His wife, who has now remarried, said she also believes he is innocent. 'Bob deserved so much better than the . representation he received, and I will forever feel guilty about my part . in the affair and how it impacted Jim Owen's work on Bob's case,' she told the Dispatch. 'Even though Bob and I are no longer married, I have always known he is innocent, and I am committed to seeing him freed.' One of Caulley's attorneys, Assistant Public Defender Kim Rigby, said the judge's decision for a new trial effectively overturns his convictions. 'The court has rightfully recognized that attorney Owen was acting under an egregious conflict of interest and neglected his work on Caulley's case, a case that was clearly not a slam-dunk for the prosecution,' she said.","James D.

"Torment: Sonali Mukherjee says she will spend the money from her Who Wants To Be A Millionaire win on surgery . An acid attack victim who won the jackpot on India's biggest quiz show is refusing to give up on justice - despite her attackers remaining free. Sonali Mukherjee was 17 years old when a spurned suitor and his friends broke into her home and doused her body in Tezaab, a chemical normally used to clean rusted tools, while she slept. She was left partially blind and deaf with 70 per cent burns on her body and has received no state funding for . her treatment. Last year, she wrote to the Indian government . threatening to kill herself if she did not receive state aid. Her three attackers served only four months of their nine-year sentences before they were freed on appeal. Now . 28, Miss Mukherjee, says only justice will give her closure and, . spurred on by her new-found fame and fortune, is determined to spearhead . a major change in women's rights in India. She said: 'I used to be a beautiful, confident woman. But my beauty became my curse. 'For . three years after the attack, I was in shock and unable to do anything. I even applied for euthanasia but when that was refused I decided to . fight back. 'People like these three men, who can spoil someone's life like this in a fraction of a second should be brought to justice. 'These . incidents [of acid attacks] will stop only when people involved are . given hard punishments according to the crime they have committed. 'I . have seen them once in the court but my father who follows my case is . taunted by them saying to us, ""Nothing will come out of this court case. Make peace with us."" 'But I will never give up until they are brought to justice. Scroll down for video . Fresh-faced: Sonali Mukherjee pictured in her cadet uniform before the attack . Ordeal: She says that she wants her family to return to normal life after her horrendous experience . 'Female society can only be empowered . once a woman herself raises her voice towards such ill doings in . society. That is what I want to do.' India is said to be the fourth most dangerous country for females to live, according to a Thomas Reuters Foundation study. Acid sales are not regulated, with the corrosive product widely available for purchase for less than Rs. 20 (24p). Following . the attack, Miss Mukherjee struggled to cope, her mother fell into . depression and the family left their hometown of Dhanbad for the capital . New Delhi. There she . underwent surgery 22 times, with the series of operations and . consultations she has already endured costing hundreds of thousands of . rupees. Her family sold . ancestral land and her mother's jewellery to pay for the treatment and . had run out of money for further procedures before her win. Miss Mukherjee pictured on Who Wants to be a Millionaire? last year with former Miss Universe Lara Dutta and host Amitabh Bachchan, known as Big B in India . She says that it will cost an . estimated 1.5million rupees for her to look 'even remotely human' and to . have her eyesight restored. Earlier . this year some Rs 30 lakh was raised by Mumbai-based company Beti as . part of Project Hope and celebrities such as Bollywood actress Juhi . Chawla and producer Ramesh Tauran also donated funds to the appeal. Miss Mukherjee won a million rupees - almost £30,000 - on Kaun Banega Crorepati, the Indian edition of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? The show shot to worldwide fame when it was featured at the centre of Danny Boyle's Oscar-winning Slumdog Millionaire. Her appearance, alongside Bollywood actress and former Miss Universe Lara Dutta, was on a special edition featuring contestants who overcame adversity. The show's host Amitabh Bachchan, known as Big B in India, said: 'Denied justice, she pleaded publicly to end her life. Denied that too because euthanasia is illegal in the country, she decided not to remain silent and suffer. 'Her story is one of immense courage. 'The nation salutes her as do all of us, but simultaneously hangs its head in shame for this dastardly act.' Her jackpot win of Rs 25 laks - equivalent to almost £30,000 - came as part of a one-off edition of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? called Doosra Mauka, or Second Chance, which featured contestants who have shown courage in the face of adversity. Now, Miss Mukherjee is appealing for 'stringent punishment' for her attackers. She said: 'Such incidents should stop and they will stop only when people involved in such cases are given hard punishments. 'They need to be punished according to the crime that they've done. 'People like these who can spoil anyone's life like this in a fraction of a second should be brought to justice. They too should get the same treatment. 'I am lucky that I survived and wish the same does not happen to any other girl. 'According to the doctors my condition was so dire I shouldn't have survived. 'But now it is time to change the 50-year-old law so that such cases do not ever occur in the future.' With her winnings Sonali hopes to return her family's life back to normal. She said: 'Firstly I will get my treatment done, but my family is in a very dire state. 'They have sold off everything for my treatment and neither do we have a job to earn anything. 'My . mother has been in a very bad mental state since my attack, my . grandfather suffered a heart attack and we do not have a house of our . own. 'So my main motive . with the money is to get my treatment done so that I can at least start a . normal life, and take my family and myself out of this trauma.

"An aspiring TV producer who was being held captive by a knife-wielding man in West Hollywood was accidentally gunned down by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies as he tried to escape his assailant. John Winkler, 30, a one-time production assistant on the Comedy Central show Tosh.0, died at an area hospital following Monday night's confrontation. Mr Winkler had been taken hostage at knifepoint along with two other men inside a Palm Avenue apartment by Alexander McDonald, according to a Sheriff's Department statement. Scroll down for video . Innocent bystander: John Winkler, 30, a one-time production assistant on the Comedy Central show Tosh.0, was gunned down by Los Angeles sheriff's deputies who mistook him for a hostage taker . McDonald, 27, then began stabbing his captives and fighting with them in a rage, the statement alleged. Deputies got a call at around 9.30pm Monday that a man was stabbing someone and went to the apartment in the 930 block of Palm Avenue, but nobody answered the door, authorities said. Suddenly the door burst opened and a man rushed out. ‘He was covered in blood and bleeding profusely from the neck,’ the statement said. Winkler followed and appeared to be ‘lunging at the back of the fleeing victim,’ the statement said. Three deputies opened fire, hitting both men. Winkler was mortally wounded by a single shot. The bleeding man was shot in the leg and was hospitalized in stable condition. ‘Believing Winkler was the assailant and the assault was ongoing and he would attack the entry team, three deputies fired their duty weapons at him,’ the LASD statement read. Crime scene: The deadly incident played out Monday night inside an apartment complex in the 900 block of Palm Avenue in West Hollywood . Violent confrontation: Officials say Winkler's friend and neighbor Alexander McDonald, 27 (left) took the aspiring producer (right) and two other men hostage at knife-point, and then began stabbing them . Deputies charged into the apartment and allegedly saw McDonald choking a man on the floor. That man was treated for stab wounds and other injuries and released, according to the Sheriff's Department statement. McDonald was treated for minor injuries. County prosecutors have charged him with torture, murder and attempted murder. He is being held on $4million bail. Authorities said Winkler lived in an . apartment above the unit where the stabbing occurred, and that all four . men involved in the deadly incident were friends who were 'just hanging . out' Monday night, the station KTLA reported. Speaking to the Los Angeles Times, Interim Sheriff John Scott called the shooting’ very tragic.’ Responding deputies had been told the attacker was wearing a black shirt and Winkler was wearing a black shirt, Scott said. 'I have no doubt the entire Sheriff’s . Department mourns the death of John Winkler, none more than the deputies . involved,' the sheriff added. Winkler was friends with two people who were taken hostage and he had rushed to the apartment when he heard them screaming, his roommate, Devin Richardson, told the Times. Big dreams: Winkler, a graduate of the Seattle Film School, filled in as a production assistant for three days on Daniel Tosh's (pictured) Comedy Central show Tosh.0 . ‘It's just a really sad story,’ Richardson said. ‘He basically went to help some neighbors and ends up getting shot.’ Winkler had moved to West Hollywood from Washington state six months ago to work in the entertainment industry, his friend said. He had landed a three-day job filling in as a production assistant on the Comedy Central show ‘Tosh.0,’ a spokeswoman for the network told Reuters. In a statement to MailOnline Friday, Comedy Central spokesperson Renata Luczak said: 'Comedy Central and ‘Tosh.0’ extend their deepest condolences to the family of John Winkler. 'We only had the privilege of working with him for a short while and extend heartfelt sympathy to his family and friends during this tragic time.'","John Winkler, 30, was shot dead by LA Sheriff's Department deputies responding to a stabbing report .

The Filipowicz family lived on Fox Beach Avenue, which was among the hardest hit streets on the island. Neil Filipowicz, 46, John Sr's brother, told MailOnline that his brother decided to ignore warnings to evacuate after Hurricane Irene last year and a 1992 storm. He said: 'I spoke to Joseph and he said . that that day he tried to get him to leave. He was on the phone and was . telling John [Jr] to leave the house. He told him: 'I'm not leaving . Daddy.'

It was a bond how it's supposed to be with your kids, between a son and a father. They loved each other so much. They had an incredible bond.' Neil, a retired New York City firefighter who served on 9/11, said the family became concerned when they were unable to reach either father or son during Monday night's storm. Neil went to their house the next day at 7.30am, had a look round the house and noticed his brother's keys and wallet were on the table but there was no sign of them. John jr pictured with a friend . Neil, Christine and other relatives then went round local hostels and when they found nothing, Neil went back to the house on his own. Neil said: 'I crawled through a hole in the wall that the water had made. I shone my flashlight from right to left and then I saw a hand, to my left. 'I was praying it was a doll's hand but I reached in the water and grabbed it and my nephew came up. 'My brother came up too, he had his arm round the back of his head, shielding him. 'I was pulling both of them at the same time, by their shirts and a neighbour came and helped me remove them and we put them on the side of the house until they were moved by the National Guard and the Medical Examiner. 'My nephew was holding my brother and my brother was clutching him into his chest as if they knew they were dying. 'My brother was protecting him. Their eyes were open. My brother looked intense, like he was still trying to fight the end and be the father and protect his son. My nephew was so scared. 'The water line on this was 10ft up but I'm thinking it must have been much higher.' Neil said that the two men were in the basement because they were checking on things.'

No water got through it. 'All the foam had to be cut out, he . probably was checking on it and maybe he heard a crack in the structure, . but once that gave way, the rush of the water, that pressure. ‘Some of the cinderblocks are over the other side of the basement.

Fighting back the tears, Neil said that he had been on duty as a New York City fireman on 9/11 but that 'nothing compares to this because of the closeness.' Neighbours knew John the elder as the 'mayor' of the street because he looked after them all by helping clean the snow out of the street in winter. They in turn referred to him by the family nickname, 'Flip'. Paying tribute to his brother, Neil said: 'My brother was all about family. Even our friends were considered family, it was like an extended family. 'He was United States Marine out of High School. He served in Greneda then he worked in the New York City Corrections Department and from there he retired and worked for the Concrete Labourers Union for a while. 'He was a big family man, loved his wife and kids immensely. For the last few years he drove a bus for school kids. 'He was football coach, a basketball coach.

"British officials were last night accused of ‘political interference’ in a crucial report on international climate change. The economic impact of global warming was ramped up in the final draft by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Shortly before authors wrote the final version, a British Government official passed scientists a note complaining about an earlier, more moderate draft. British officials were last night accused of 'political interference' in a crucial report on international climate change . The official, from Ed Davey’s Department for Energy and Climate Change, said the economic section of the report was at best an ‘under-estimate’ and at worst ‘completely meaningless’. The final document, published today in Japan, increases the predicted economic impact of global warming. Critics said the suggestion of political interference by the Coalition, which set out to be the ‘greenest government ever’, was alarming. Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘It is always the same with climate change. If the facts don’t suit them, they change it to suit them. ‘A Government official interfering with an independent scientific report is ridiculous. What you want … is what the independent scientific community thinks – not what people want them to say for their political purposes.’ The IPCC report is the first comprehensive analysis in seven years of the global consequences of climate change. It warns that the world is ‘ill-prepared’ and that the effects are ‘already occurring on all continents and across the oceans’. Rising temperatures, droughts and heatwaves will threaten food supplies and human health, while hundreds of millions of people will be hit by coastal flooding, it finds. The report, by more than 300 authors, informs policy decisions of governments around the world. But one of its contributors has accused the IPCC of being too ‘alarmist’ – and demanded his name be withdrawn. Professor Richard Tol, an economist at the University of Sussex, said the drafts had been changed to make the findings more ‘apocalyptic’. He said colleagues ‘drifted too far to the alarmist side’ and were likening climate change to the ‘four horsemen of the apocalypse’. His section of the report, based on 18 economic studies, predicted in early drafts that global warming of 2.5C would cut economic output by between 0.2 and 2 per cent a year – much less than previous estimates of up to 20 per cent. But the final IPCC report labels his predictions ‘incomplete estimates’. It states: ‘Losses are more likely than not to be greater … than this range.’ Britain, among other nations, lobbied for this highly significant change. On Friday, before final drafting discussions, the British government submitted a note faulting the draft. It said: ‘The quoted figures of 0.2 to 2 per cent of GDP [gross domestic product] are at best an under-estimate, and at worst completely meaningless.’ Other governments including Belgium, France and Norway also complained. But Chris Field, co-chair of the IPCC writers, last night dismissed criticism of the last-minute alteration and said the final report gave a ‘much clearer picture’. Despite praising Professor Tol as a ‘wonderful scientist’, Professor Field of Stanford University, added: ‘There were a couple of meaningful errors in the way Richard had done his analysis.’ Mr Davey said: ‘The science has spoken … This evidence builds the case for early action … We cannot afford to wait.’ A DECC spokesman said climate change impacts could be ‘catastrophic’, adding: ‘These cannot be underestimated and the UK Government, as well as other countries, are seeking to make sure this is understood the world over.’ But Professor Gordon Hughes, an environmental economist at Edinburgh University, said: ‘The IPCC has been a political body ever since it started … this is political interference.","Final document increases predicted economic impact of global warming .

"Can you tell the difference between a fake $50 note and a real one? It seems most people have trouble spotting the difference. The Commander of the NSW Police Force’s Fraud and Cybercrime Squad has urged the community to be on the lookout for counterfeit banknotes, with double the amount of fake notes being reported from July to August. Detective Superintendent Arthur Katsogiannis says fakes have been circulating in numerous locations throughout NSW in recent weeks. Scroll down for video . The Commander of the NSW  Fraud and Cybercrime Squad has urged the community to be on the lookout for counterfeit banknotes, after an increase in the number of counterfeit notes reported to police during August. The fake notes have been circulating in numerous locations throughout NSW in recent weeks . Two counterfeit $100 notes (top) seized by police are held next to a genuine note (bottom). The counterfeit notes appear very similar to the actual notes but are slightly darker and the clear window is stuck on. 'Since the beginning of August, we have seen an increase in the number of counterfeit banknotes being reported to police,' he said. 'During July, we received 41 reports concerning counterfeit banknotes. The number of reports for August was 81.' Police have seen a number of different counterfeit notes throughout the last month. 'While the notes we’ve seized have been from a range of denominations, the vast majority are fifty and one hundred dollar notes,' said Detective Superintendent Katsogiannis. 'Some of the counterfeit notes we’ve seized have been printed on paper, and some on plastic. All genuine banknotes are printed on a special form of plastic.' For those who think they might be victim to receiving a counterfeit banknote, police say there are some key features which can tell them apart from the real notes. 'With respect to the counterfeit notes printed on paper, they tear quite easily. Obviously, real notes do not tear.' he said. Two counterfeit $100 notes seized by police in Sydney. Police say counterfeit notes printed on paper tear quite easily while real ones do not. Plastic counterfeit notes usually feel slightly thicker and have poorer clarity . Plastic counterfeit money usually feels slightly thicker than the real thing and the clarity of the images is not as sharp as a real note. Police are appealing to consumers as well as business owners to keep an eye out for fake notes, being sure to check all security features are there. 'If you find a banknote that you are concerned about, please let us know,' said the detective. Anyone with information about counterfeit banknotes is urged to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or go to the Crime Stoppers online reporting page. *Handle the suspect banknote as little as possible and store it in an envelope. *Note any relevant information, such as how it came into your possession. *Report the matter immediately to State or Federal police. *You are well within your rights to refuse to accept a banknote if you have concerns about it. *Under no circumstances should you take actions that may jeopardise your safety or that of others.","Police urging people and businesses to be on the lookout for counterfeit banknotes circulating in NSW .

"Five geckos sent into space in an experiment to see the effects of weightlessness on sexual behaviour have all died. The reptiles were launched into orbit by Russia's federal space agency on the Foton-M satellite to see how zero gravity would effect their reproductive habits. But after the satellite returned to earth this week, scientists revealed the animals have not survived the journey and are suspected of having frozen to death. Five geckos - one male and four females - were sent into space by Russian scientists to see how zero gravity would effect their sexual behaviour. File photo . The satellite was launched from Kazakhstan in July, carrying geckos, silkworm eggs, fruit flies and mushrooms for different experiments. After Russia's space agency lost contact with the satellite later that month, a connection was re-established before the satellite landed yesterday. A journalist from the country, Anatoly Zak, tweeted live updates from the touch-down and revealed the fate of the animals - one of which was male and other four female. Next to a photo of the satellite, he tweeted: '#FotonM4 lands successfully'. But he later added: 'All #geckos onboard landed #Foton satellite are found dead' A representative at the Institute of Biomedical Problems (ISTC), which was carrying out the experiment, told Russian news agency Itar-Tass: 'It's still too early to talk about the geckos' cause of death.' But a source involved in the mission later revealed that 'preliminary information' indicated the geckos had frozen. It was the latest accident for Russia's space programme, which had two rockets crash recently. File photo . The Guardian reported the source as saying: 'Most likely, this happened due to a failure of the equipment meant to ensure the temperature of the box with the animals.' It is believed the fruit flies on board survived the conditions in space. The first animals ever sent into space were fruit flies, who were shot into the air on a U.S. V2 rocket in 1947. Two years later, Albert II was the first monkey sent into space, but died when his parachute failed on his return. In 1957, the first animal into orbit, a dog named Laika, was launched aboard the Soviet Sputnik 2, the second-ever orbiting spacecraft. Laika also died during the flight. Since then, mice, rabbits, frogs, rats, wasps and even a tortoise have all been sent into space, but rarely survive the experience.","One male and four female lizards blasted into space by Russian scientists .

"The 16-year-old girl said she was too ‘upset, hurt and angry’ to go back to Camden School for Girls after it refused to allow her to wear a niqab (file picture) A Muslim teenager who was banned from taking A-levels at a leading comprehensive because she started to wear a niqab has moved schools. The unnamed 16-year-old said she was too ‘upset, hurt and angry’ to go back to Camden School for Girls after it refused to allow her to wear the full Islamic veil which only reveals her eyes. The girl reportedly left the north London state school in tears after being told she could not wear the niqab and then decided to move to one that allows it. Last night, an online petition had gathered more than 1,000 signatures demanding that ‘Islamophobia’ at the school stop and that she be allowed to wear the veil. The school is rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted and alumnae include Gordon Brown’s wife Sarah, actress Emma Thompson and former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell. It has no uniform and is famous for a liberal approach to education, but it said the niqab contravened its ‘appearance policy’. The girl, who has attended Camden Girls for the past five years and took her GCSEs there, yesterday said the niqab was not ‘un-British’. ‘I was born in Britain. I know perfect English, I enjoy doing the normal, typical things like drinking tea and eating biscuits,’ she told the Evening Standard. ‘Britain claims to be multicultural, meaning they accept different kinds of people.’ She added: ‘I feel if people knew how friendly and social we are, they wouldn’t say it’s un-British.’ The girl said the school told her that dress ‘which does not allow teacher-student interactions’ was against its rules. ‘The school has no uniform and I thought they were accepting and open-minded,’ she said. ‘To be honest a lot of people at the school wear inappropriate clothing … very provocative and revealing clothing like extremely short shorts – so it didn’t make sense that they were refusing me to wear the niqab.’ She will now study for her A-levels at a different sixth-form college, even though it takes her up to an hour to get there every day. In support of the girl, an anonymous protester started a petition on change.org, which says: ‘[Camden School for Girls] is renowned for its individuality and strong feminist views. Camden School for Girls (pictured) claimed its 'appearance policy' was ‘educational’ and said in a statement: 'Inappropriate dress which offends public decency or which does not allow  interactions will be challenged' 'However, this poorly thought out decision made by the school contradicts this. What happened to freedom of expression?’ The girl’s sister told the BBC the school’s ruling had been ‘very upsetting’, adding: ‘My sister just wants to wear the niqab for her own reasons … I don’t feel like her education should be compromised or the way she dresses should affect the way anyone looks at her.’ Farhana Khanom, a former pupil, said ‘discriminating’ against those who want to wear the veil was ‘utterly disgusting’. Yesterday, Camden School for Girls claimed the policy was ‘educational’, saying: ‘Interactions between students and teachers take place in a number of ways, but one of the most important is through reading facial expression.’ In a statement, it added: ‘Inappropriate dress which offends public decency or which does not allow teacher-student interactions will be challenged.’ The school is thought to be the first to have imposed a bar on the niqab since Birmingham Metropolitan College was forced to overturn a ban last September, following a petition signed by 9,000 people. Under Department for Education guidance issued in 2007 schools can set their own uniform policies and enforce such a ban on security, safety or learning grounds. A landmark case at the High Court that year rejected a Buckinghamshire pupil’s claim that she should be allowed to wear the niqab in classes.","Teenager is 'too upset, hurt and angry' to return to Camden School for Girls .

"A former Roman Catholic priest accused of sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl in Minnesota has been arrested in his native country of India, where he was a fugitive for the past several years. The Rev Joseph Palanivel Jeyapaul fled to southern India after he was accused of molesting Megan Peterson, now 22. Ms Peterson came forward last fall to say she was abused by Jeyapaul in 2004 when she was seeking advice about becoming a nun. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Police in southern India have arrested Rev. Joseph Palanivel Jeyapaul, who is wanted in the U.S. on sexual assault charges . Alleged victim: Megan Peterson (right) now 22, claims she was sexually assaulted by Jeyapaul when she was 14; she is pictured with attorney Jeff Anderson . The Rev. Joseph Palanivel Jeyapaul appeared Monday in a New Delhi court and will be held in custody pending a formal U.S. request for his extradition, to be filed along with case evidence, government officials said. But he won’t go to trial any time soon - processing the request could take up to three months. Police detained Jeyapaul on Friday near the southern Indian town of Erode after Interpol issued an alert, police Subinspector Pugal Maran told the Associated Press. Jeyapaul, 57, an Indian citizen, has denied molesting a Ms Peterson when he was working at the Blessed Sacrament Church in Greenbush, a Minnesota town near the Canadian border. Priesthood: Jeyapaul worked as a priest at Infant Jesus Church in India, but was banned from being around children . Captured: He was arrested in the Erode district, in the southern state of Tamil Nadu . He returned to India in 2005 to visit his ailing mother, and was asked not to return to the Minnesota church after being accused of having an inappropriate relationship with another 16-year-old. The criminal case relating to the 14-year-old was filed later. Jeyapaul never returned to the United States and has been a fugitive there ever since. Vatican officials recommended Jeyapaul's removal from the priesthood, but the local Indian bishop instead sentenced him to a year in a monastery through a canonical trial, the Chicago Tribune reported. Former parish: He had served at the Blessed Sacrament Church in Minnesota . Prosecuting: Attorney Jeff Anderson (left) speaks about Father Joseph Jeyapaul case in St. Paul . Jeyapaul was one of many foreign priests brought to the United States to help fill shortages in American parishes. Ms Paterson told the paper she was shocked that Jeyapaul was arrested so quickly, following a March 11 interview she did with the Tribune. ‘I find it quite ironic that we did that interview and then a week later he is in handcuffs,’ Ms Peterson said. ‘I wasn’t expecting it to happen this fast.’ Watch video here: .","Joseph Jeyapaul accused of sexually assaulting Minnesota girl, 14, in 2004 .

"Oscar Pistorius has been handed the dubious chance to resurrect his athletics career after being sentenced to what could be as little as 10 months’ imprisonment for shooting his girlfriend dead. Although Pistorius was sentenced to five years for the manslaughter of 29-year-old model Reeva Steenkamp, his own legal team said he need serve only one sixth of the term behind bars. The double amputee could then be placed under house arrest at his uncle Arnold’s mansion — a former rectory — on Lawley Street in Waterkloof, a plush Pretoria suburb that housed National Party grandees in the apartheid years. South African police escort Oscar Pistorius (left) to prison in the back of an armoured vehicle . Pistorius is led to the police van after leaving the North Gauteng High Court to be taken to jail . Pistorius pictured in November 2012 with girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, who he shot dead in their home . Unlike the cell at Pretoria’s main prison where Pistorius spent last night, the high walls and electric fences at his uncle’s house are there to keep the criminals out. Some legal experts said Pistorius would be allowed to leave the house to train and possibly to compete. CLICK HERE to read the full timeline of events in the case that stunned sport . However, the International Paralympic Committee told Sportsmail that the athlete could not run in their competitions until 2019, when his full five-year term will have elapsed. An IPC spokesman confirmed: ‘It is 2019 as far as we are concerned. The only way that could change is if he successfully appealed against the judgment.’ That means Pistorius will miss the Rio Paralympics in 2016, but could be free to take part in Tokyo four years later. Pistorius hands his watch to his uncle, Arnold Pistorius, as he is led down to the cells of the court . The athlete turns to leave the dock after learning that he will serve a maximum of five years in prison . By then he would be 33 — a year older than Linford Christie when he won the 100 metres gold medal at the Barcelona Olympics. Neither the IAAF — the governing body of athletics — nor the International Olympic Committee would comment on the sporting implications of Tuesday's sentencing by Judge Thokozile Masipa. The IOC limited themselves to saying the case was a ‘human tragedy for the family of Reeva Steenkamp and also for Oscar Pistorius’ and that they ‘hope time will bring comfort to all those concerned’. Regardless of eligibility, Pistorius is unlikely to compete against able-bodied opponents again. It was remarkable that he did so in the first place at London 2012. Then he was in his mid-20s, and a repeat effort may now be beyond his mental and physical capabilities. Pistorius stands in the dock as his sentence is delivered at the high court in Pretoria on Tuesday . Pistorius, who was impassive as he stood to hear the sentence, is said by his management to think it too early to contemplate a return to the track. A disincentive to competing again — apart from the opprobrium that he would face — is the impossibility of ever earning anything like as lavishly as he did when he wore a halo: the back jacket of his autobiography hailed him ‘one of the most inspirational figures on the planet — from immobilised child to world-class sprinter’. At his peak Pistorius earned £300,000 from athletics and a further £1million from sponsorship annually. He had a £450,000 property portfolio, including the marble-floored bachelor pad on Pretoria’s guarded Silverwoods Estate — the house in which he killed Steenkamp with four shots through the bathroom door on February 14 last year. The 'Blade Runner' made history at London 2012 by becoming the first amputee to run at the Olympic Games . Pistorius runs during the 100m T44 round 1 at the 2012 Paralympics at the Olympic Stadium in Stratford . Pistorius has since sold all his houses and cars to pay his legal bills. His defence team called him ‘broke and broken’. Deals with Nike, BT, Oakley and French designers Thierry Mugler have all long stopped. However, his family’s wealth from mineral mining means he is probably not destitute. The National Prosecuting Authority, who charged Pistorius with premeditated murder, have 14 days to decide whether to appeal. But June Steenkamp, the victim’s mother, seemed to have had enough, saying: ‘I’m just so glad it’s over.’ Arnold Pistorius, whose hands Oscar clasped as he was led away at North Gauteng High Court, spoke for his family and nephew: ‘We accept the judgment,’ he said. ‘Oscar will embrace the opportunity to pay back society.’","Pistorius sentenced to five years in prison for killing Reeva Steenkamp .

John Snavely, 26, allegedly stabbed Sam Del Brocco a dozen times in the chest following a fight about money in September 2010 - but he avoided suspicion for nearly three years and continued his hard-partying lifestyle of drugs, fast cars and sex as he rose the ranks of Florida's porn industry. Snavely was finally arrested and charged with murder in August when his DNA, which had been taken at a drug arrest in Miami, matched DNA on a marijuana joint and Diet Coke can at the murder scene. Now the Miami New Times has revealed sordid details surrounding the grisly killing, detailing Del Brocco's final hours and unraveling Snavely's troubled childhood and addictions to cash and drugs. Arrest: Gay stripper and porn star John Snavely, left, allegedly stabbed millionaire marketing executive, Sam Del Brocco, right, to death in his Florida beach house in September 2010 after meeting at a gay club . Success: Snavely started with gay porn but soon rose up the ranks of straight porn. He also worked in a gay strip clubs and friends said he was addicted to the party lifestyle and drugs that the job afforded . The reporter, Michael Miller, also . spoke to Snavely, who performed both gay and straight porn under the . name 'Champ', in jail in Fort Lauderdale, where he protested his . innocence. 'Everyone thinks I'm a killer just . because my life was taboo,' he said. 'All I . have to say is that I'm innocent.' Broward . County sheriff’s detectives believe that Del Brocco, a marketing . executive from Alexandria, Virginia who worked in Washington D.C., flew . to Florida and bought cocaine and marijuana before he visited his . favorite gay strip clubs. He . was introduced to Snavely at a club called Boardwalk, where Snavely . performed as a stripper, and the pair jumped in Del Brocco's Porsche and . went to his townhouse in Pompano Beach. Detectives believe Del Brocco plied . the younger man with drugs and then Snavely demanded $500 in cash . up-front before Del Brocco demanded he dance for him, the New Times . reported. But then an . argument ensued - the reporter suggested Del Brocco got too touchy or . that Snavely cut short his performance - and Snavely stormed out. Life in the fast lane: Snavely avoided suspicion . for three years - enjoying drugs, cash and sex as he made up to $4,000 a . week making porn and stripping at gay clubs. But friends said he also . had a temper . Scene: He was stabbed to death at his beach condo after allegedly meeting Snavely at a gay club . Rather . than just leaving the plush home, he reached the kitchen and had second . thoughts - and pulled open a drawer and found a long butcher's knife, . the paper reported. He then allegedly returned to . the bedroom and repeatedly stabbed the older man before fleeing the . bloody scene - and leaving a trail of bloodied imprints from his Nike . shoes. In the kitchen, he allegedly wiped . down the knife before throwing it under a rug and leaving. He had also . allegedly left DNA behind on the joint and the can and fingerprints on . Del Brocco's car. Police . visited the home the next day to carry out a welfare check after . friends in Washington D.C. had been unable to get through to him on the . phone. The investigation turned on the DNA evidence. In . the years before Snavely was linked to the crime, he rose up the ranks . of the porn industry in Florida - earning as much as $4,000 a week by . shooting multiple sex scenes and stripping. It . followed a troubled childhood with an absent father, criminal mother . and his own arrests for petty crimes before a stint stripping in gay . clubs in San Antonio, Texas - he insisted he was straight but that the . gay clubs paid better. Double life: Samuel Del Brocco, pictured with his partner of 30 years, Jan Shafer (right), was a businessman in Virginia. When he visited Florida, he visited gay clubs, which is where he allegedly met Snavely . Victim: Police say Snavely murdered Del Brocco, pictured, after they fought about money at his home . It was there that he was spotted in 2009 by a porn industry recruiter, who saw him as ideal for the gay market and he began scoring roles in gay porn films in 2010. By 2011, he had switched to straight porn films using the screen name 'Champ', where he was shooting multiple scenes as well as sleeping with numerous women off set every week. 'He loved to spend money, man,' a friend told the New Times. 'Watches, shoes, clothes, name-brand shit. He . felt like a nobody if he didn't have a BMW or some kind of ridiculous . car.' But while loving the high life, friends and roommates claimed he also had a short temper and his girlfriend, who was just 15 when they met on set, suffered abuse at his hands, they said. He cut her hair and once burned her face in a bid to find out whether or not she had been cheating. 'Champ was a great person, but he had a dark side,' a friend said. Plea: Before Snavely was arrested, Del Brocco's partner Jan Shafer pleaded for information and said that she would have to accept his double life if it led to investigators solving the murder . On December 9, 2012 he was pulled over in Fort Pierce and police allegedly found marijuana, Xanax, and amphetamines in the car. He was given probation this summer and authorities swabbed his cheek before he left. After the sample was entered into the state database, it allegedly matched DNA from the Coke can and the joint from the Del Brocco murder scene. He was arrested on July 25 and charged in August. Snavely is charged with second-degree murder, which carries a possible penalty of 10 years to life. Speaking to the New Times, he suggested that one of Del Brocco's employees killed him for his money, or that a rival porn star stole his semen and placed it at the scene. But he admitted he was losing himself to his onscreen alter ego. 'It became my personality,' he said. 'I couldn't just be John from Texas anymore. I always had to be Champ, Champ, Champ.'","John Snavely 'met Sam Del Brocco in September 2010 and went back to his home where they argued about money'

"The dog adopted and then returned by Governor Rick Scott during the 2010 GOP campaign, had to be given back because he bit an employee at his Florida mansion, it was revealed today. Scott was slammed last week after it was discovered he only kept the dog - Reagan - for the duration of his gubernatorial campaign, and gave . the retriever back after he was sworn into office. But it was revealed today that the governor was forced to send the dog back after he bit a mansion grounds employee on January 7, 2011, three days after he took office. Adopted: Gov. Rick Scott adopted this Labrador retriever, Reagan, ahead of his GOP nomination in 2010, and gave him back to his previous owner only a year later . Scott posted photos of the dog on his Facebook during the campaign and had constituents name the pooch . Scott . had adopted the retriever shortly after his GOP nomination two years . ago. The candidate posted photos of the dog to his Facebook campaign . website, asking constituents to help name the newest member of his . family. Scott spokeswoman Melissa Sellers said: 'The governor and first lady love dogs and they had to make a hard . decision when it was clear that Reagan was very anxious around lots of . different people.' The Scotts have since adopted Tallee, a calmer, gentler seven-year-old yellow Lab. Mansion grounds employee . Jennifer Kinsey was arranging flowers in the mansion when Reagan bit her . on the right hand, according to an incident report made by her . supervisor for the Department of Management Services. The injury was not serious and did not need medical treatment, according to The Miami Herald. Facebook friends chose the name Reagan . from a list of three choices suggested by the campaign and applauded . the candidate’s decision to adopt a rescue dog instead of a . purebred, such as President Obama’s dog, Bo, a Portuguese water dog. However, reporters from the Tampa Bay Times noticed that Reagan had not been seen since Scott’s 2011 inauguration. After . some digging, the reporters realized there were no photos of Reagan . since before the election. Images of the dog had been removed from . Scott's gubernatorial campaign website as well. Bad fit? Gov. Scott said that Reagan would bark . constantly if anyone was carrying something; he was elected Florida's . governor in 2010 and sworn in a year later . Stumping: Rick Scott pictured holding a child on the campaign trail in 2010 . Ms Sellers said Gov Scott flew Reagan back to Naples on his private jet to the place they adopted him from. 'The family decided that the best decision for the dog and all those who . visit (the Governor’s Mansion) would be to have the grooming business . find Reagan a more appropriate home with less people and activity,' Sellers said. 'It was a hard choice that sometimes pet owners have to . make.' Last Monday, reporters confronted Scott about the case of the vanishing dog. The governor said that Reagan ‘scared the living daylights’ out of everyone living at his Tallahassee mansion and that it wasn’t working out. The dog, he said, would not stop barking if he saw a person carrying something. Scott said that because of Reagan’s temperament, he had no choice but to return him to his previous owner.","Rick Scott adopted rescue dog Reagan during the 2010 campaign for Florida governor .

"England face the ‘most dominant team in the history of the world’ at Twickenham on Saturday, adamant they won’t fall into the familiar trap of being beaten by their opponents’ imperious status. The All Blacks have largely lived up to their own hype by sweeping aside all-comers for the last three years. Since the start of the previous World Cup campaign, which ended in tense triumph for New Zealand, the Kiwis have played 46 Tests, winning 42 and drawing two. Just two defeats represents a considerable dominance. FORM GUIDE Scroll down for a complete form guide on England vs New Zealand . England face the ‘most dominant team in the history of the world’ at Twickenham on Saturday afternoon . England's squad were put through their paces at Twickenham with a sprinting drill on Friday afternoon . The squad do their stretches as they continue their build-up to face the fierce test of New Zealand on Saturday . Yet, one of those losses occurred in the same corner of south-west London where they will put their reputation on the line again on Saturday. England smashed the All Blacks at home in 2012 and since then they have taken heart from some notable near-misses — one here last November, followed by two in June, in the hostile surroundings of Auckland and Dunedin. So, despite a hiding in their last meeting in Hamilton, Stuart Lancaster’s team will hurl themselves into the fray on Saturday armed with the conviction they can hammer another dent in the All Blacks’ reputation for invincibility. They have seen doubt in Kiwi eyes. They have seen flaws in the awesome machine. The time has come to capitalise. There is always the issue of aura when New Zealand are in town but England coach Andy Farrell played it down on Friday. Asked if there was any danger of the hosts being beaten before they even start this QBE series opener, he said: ‘Probably for some teams but this team believe they can go out and perform against a world-class side. England smashed the All Blacks at home in 2012, winning 38-21, as Chris Ashton (pictued) celebrates . England have taken heart from some notable near-misses - one last November and followed by two in June . New Zealand's Richie McCaw and coach Steve Hansen don't look pleased after losing against England in 2012 . ‘Our boys have the utmost respect for the phenomenal achievements of the All Blacks over the last however many years. But I don’t get any sense there’s an aura that can’t be broken down by our boys, because preparation and knowledge dispel that type of fear. ‘They believe this England side is their team and they’re trying to make their own aura. Of course, that’s still in the development stage but we’re going to get there.’ The countdown to this momentous fixture has been dominated by profound disruption to English plans. Lancaster  and his assistants have had to cope with injuries to key players. Among the tight forwards in particular, the losses have been acute, with Alex Corbisiero, Dan Cole, Mako Vunipola, Tom Youngs, Joe Launchbury, Geoff Parling and Ed Slater among the missing men. In addition, England are without Manu Tuilagi and Luther Burrell, Tom Croft and Tom Johnson. Others such as Marland Yarde, Jack Nowell and Stephen Myler have been deemed not ready for selection after recent injuries. It could be argued a starting XV of unavailable Englishmen would run Saturday’s line-up close, or even beat them. Stuart Lancaster, the England head coach, looks on during training at Twickenham ahead of Saturday's tie . England's Andy Farrell: 'They believe this England side is their team and they’re trying to make their own aura' Lancaster (pictured) and his England assistants have had to cope with injuries to several key players . VIDEO O2 Inside Line Season 5, Episode 1 . But the management have not lamented the absentees and that is the right tone to set as they still have considerable firepower. Supported by the world’s richest union, the national team have so much in their favour which must be translated on to the scoreboard. England have greater depth in many positions than at any time in recent memory. The side contain sufficient power, quality and nous to stand toe to toe with the world’s leading nation. But that is not enough. England were weakened on tour in New Zealand and they came close to glorious results — going down by five points in Auckland and by just one in Dunedin. So the only outcome this Saturday afternoon that would signify progress is victory. Lancaster advances the ‘aggregate of marginal gains’ philosophy employed by British Cycling. Well, this is the sort of occasion when the gain must be measured in match points. Two more — based on that 28-27 reverse in Dunedin — will do it. Everything is in place. England have revamped their changing rooms and shirts in an effort to evoke history and national pride. They have engaged the Twickenham crowd through innovations such as the team walk through the car park. They have had inspirational guest speakers, an upgrade of their training facilities and good player access — founded on a strong rapport with the clubs. That has translated into delayed squad announcements so that form can be considered. They have also enhanced their attacking game plan. There is no escaping the All Blacks’ experience advantage but Lancaster is convinced that youthful vigour can prevail. There was a nagging sense of Kiwi unrest in June that their revered Test team were showing small signs of decline. Since then, New Zealand have lost to the Springboks and drawn with Australia. They are mere mortals, and England can beat them if their mental strength is as robust as Farrell says and they hit the intense heights of 2012. This is a tipping point. Defeat would be a fifth in a row against these opponents and England would go into next week’s showdown against South Africa with a growing sense of desperation. Victory would create timely momentum and ignite the hosts’ World Cup preparations. The next marginal gain Lancaster needs is a famous result.

"England have been urged by their World Cup-winning captain, Martin Johnson, to put thoughts of next year’s tournament on hold and focus on seizing the ‘Holy Grail’ of victory over New Zealand. Stuart Lancaster’s England go into Saturday’s QBE series opener against the All Blacks at Twickenham aware that they need to gather powerful momentum before the 2015 showpiece event in this country. But Johnson — England’s manager during the last, ill-fated World Cup campaign, claimed on Friday that the home side must view Saturday’s Test as a prime target, whatever the longer-term ramifications of the result. England have been urged by their World Cup-winning captain Martin Johnson (pictured) to go all out to win . ‘These games and the Six Nations stand up in their own right,’ he said. ‘You’re not playing for next year, you’re playing for now. ‘A win against New Zealand is the proverbial Holy Grail. There are not many players who have that. Playing the All Blacks has a way of focusing the mind.’ Johnson is confident that England can ‘go well’ this Saturday afternoon and if they were to secure a famous victory, he knows from personal experience how that could have a positive, knock-on effect. In reference to the win in Wellington in 2003, he said: ‘Dragging a victory out in New Zealand at the end of a long season gave us a big chunk of confidence. It would do the same for England tomorrow (on Saturday). Any victory over the southern hemisphere sides is a confidence boost.’ Johnson, then captain of England, celebrates after winning the Rugby World Cup in 2003 against Australia . Johnson: ‘A win against New Zealand is the proverbial Holy Grail. There are not many players who have that' Assessing the threat posed by New Zealand, Johnson — speaking at 2015 World Cup volunteer ‘try outs’ in Leicester — added: ‘The All Blacks don’t do anything differently, they just don’t let you off the hook if you make an error.’ Richie McCaw, the visitors’ veteran captain, was asked on Friday about the notion that his team and England could find themselves in opposition at next year’s World Cup final. He said: ‘There is the possibility that, in 12 months’ time, that could be the case.’ The flanker also acknowledged that Saturday’s match is the focal point of the All Blacks’ tour for ‘a number of reasons’, adding: ‘I think back two years and we got tripped up here. Last year was a hell of a match that was in the balance for a fair bit. ‘Because of those memories, it is going to be a hell of challenge tomorrow (on Saturday). Two years ago, we went away for a month off having had a loss — in the end it was by quite a few points. ‘I don’t want to have that sort of summer again so we have to get the job right this week.’ Richie McCaw, New Zealand's  captain, says it is possible both teams could meet in next year's World Cup final .

Leeds United fan Cawley, from Cheltenham, was barred from all matches for five years when he was 16 after being caught at the centre of a 200-strong riot at the club's Elland Road ground.

I was going to risk it I would have done it years ago. The risk was not . worth it. I am not a hooligan. I don't go to cause trouble.’ His order . prohibited him from travelling on the national rail network to or . from any town or city if Leeds is playing a home or away match in that . area. Photographs of him on Facebook show him drinking and celebrating on the night of the shameful assault which took the goalkeeper by complete surprise.

"Oscar Pistorius cried himself to sleep on the first night of his five-year jail term for shooting dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. The 27-year-old star was taken to the Kgosi Mampuru prison in Pretoria to serve his jail term. Wearing an orange jump-suit, sources claimed Pistorius wept when he was placed in his cell until falling asleep. Pistorius is expected to serve just ten months of his five-year jail term. Scroll down for video . Prison sources claimed Oscar Pistorius, pictured, cried himself to sleep on the first night of his jail term . A jail source told The Citizen: 'You could hear him. Shortly after the door closed you could hear the tears … he was torn up. Broken. The crying went on and on. We think he stopped when he fell asleep. It was really bad.' Another source said he was being monitored constantly. The Correctional Services department refused to comment on the claims. Department spokesman Manelisi Wolea said: 'We have never given a blow-by-blow account of how an offender is progressing on a day to day basis. 'We have never done that for other offenders and we won’t do that for him.' The Paralympic gold medallist is undergoing a 36-hour 'comprehensive needs assessment' and orientation programme to inform him of the strict rules and regulations as a 'B' group inmate at the Kgosi Mampuru prison. He is starting a five-year sentence for the culpable homicide of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp – but could be out in just 10 months. His first night behind bars came as the model's parents told how they do 'not feel that justice has been done' but insisted they 'have to accept' the sentence imposed by the judge. Mr Morwane said: 'Once we have processed the inmate properly, we can draw up a ""sentence plan"" for him and make him aware of what programmes are available to him. 'I think he did get some rest overnight and he looked to me like he was coping with his new situation. He has everything he needs. 'Upon arrival yesterday, all of his belongings were taken from him for safe-keeping until his release and he was allocated a cell, sheets, blanket, pillow, toothpaste and toilet paper.' Pistorius was taken to the Kgosi Mampuru prison in Pretoria (pictured) to serve his five-year jail term . The prison suffers from overcrowding and gang violence so Pistorius is being kept in the hospital wing . The hospital wing at the Kgosi Mampuru facility is heavily guarded round the clock and staffed by two trained nurses. The double-amputee's 'B' group classification entitles him to keep a small number of personal photographs in his cell, have two 'no-contact' visits at weekends and on public holidays – with a maximum of 45 visits per year. Once he has served six months of his sentence and proved himself to be a co-operative prisoner, Pistorius could be elevated to group 'A' - which would entitle him to more visits and and enjoy special privileges such as chocolate and Coca-Cola. The disgraced sprinter is one of nine disabled offenders, from a total of 7217, being held in the prison, which was formerly known as Pretoria Central and was notorious under apartheid rule for its brutal treatment of political prisoners. Pistorius is undergoing a 36-hour assessment by prison staff to determine if he is a suicide risk . The kingpin of one of its notorious 'numbers gangs' has already threatened to order 'a hit' on Pistorius if he is shown preferential treatment. Khalil Subjee, who is known as The General, leads the feared 26s Gang, which rewards acts of violence with promotion within the gang hierarchy. Mr Morwane insisted the prison's most famous inmate would 'certainly not' enjoy any special treatment during his incarceration. Pistorius was found guilty of the culpable homicide of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, pictured . 'Every prisoner receives the same treatment here, Mr Pistorius will be no different.' Nevertheless, the South African runner was taken unshackled and alone from Pretoria's high court to the jail in an armoured police vehicle with armed outriders. Remand and newly-sentenced inmates appearing at the court are usually transported together in the back of a large prison van. The athlete's legal team had argued that prison posed 'a danger' to him because of his disability and fragile mental state. But Judge Thokozile Masipa said she believed Pistorius's disability had been 'over-emphasised' and his 'excellent coping skills' would equip him to adapt to life behind bars.","Pistorius is being held in the hospital wing of a Pretoria prison .

However, the 27-year-old now has a chance of having a baby because her mother, 49-year-old Linda Donaghey, has offered to be a surrogate. Ms Donaghey, a sales administrator from Leeds, was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of the cancer when she was just 25 . Linda Donaghey, 49, (left) has offered to be a surrogate for her daughter, Sarah Donaghey, 27 (right) She was devastated when she was told that the only way to save her life would be to remove her womb. However, she was given a glimmer of hope as surgeons were able to save her ovaries which tests last February revealed were still producing eggs. Within months of her hysterectomy, Ms Donaghey and her partner, Stuart Simpson, 26, started to research surrogacy. Ms Donaghey told the Sunday Mirror: ‘Our biggest worry was that even if the surrogate is pregnant with a baby that is biologically ours, legally she is the mum. We worried she wouldn’t be able to give up our baby.’ She explained how she was discussing the problem with her mother, when the grandmother-of-three said that she would act as a surrogate. She . told the Sunday Mirror: ‘I didn’t have to think twice about it. I found . it heart breaking that she’d had to go through such a terrible ordeal . at such a young age.

As a result, they now face a race against time to raise the £7,000 needed before Mrs Donaghey reaches her 50th birthday, after which doctors will be reluctant to allow her to be a surrogate.

Coach Heyneke Meyer, pictured at training in September, has picked five uncapped players in his squad . 'It's wonderful to have this kind of continuity in selection, while the five uncapped players in the squad have all been rewarded for superb form throughout the season,' Meyer told www.sarugby.net. 'Many of the selected players were at our training camp in Stellenbosch last week, where we put in a lot of very hard work. We will have to hit the ground running when we assemble in Johannesburg on Wednesday before we depart on what will be a challenging tour.' Players not considered for the trip due to injury include Saracens hooker Schalk Brits, Bath flanker Francois Louw and scrum-half Fourie du Preez. Bath's Francois Louw (left) and Saracens' Schalk Brits will miss the South Africa tour due to injury .

It was so tough, in fact, that he says he had to call on the support of his family to endure the considerable pressure. The one major signing David Moyes was able to make as United’s new manager, Fellaini found himself under more scrutiny than he perhaps should have been when he was far from alone in performing below his usual high standards. Moyes had sympathy for the midfielder he lured from Everton, saying as much in a column in the Mail on Sunday earlier this month. VIDEO Scroll down to see archive of Fellaini's first press conference as a United player . Marouane Fellaini needed the support of his family during a tough spell at Manchester United . But here, after making his third consecutive start under Louis van Gaal in Saturday’s 1-0 defeat of Crystal Palace, was Fellaini’s take on what was a tough situation for a player who was so impressive at Goodison Park. Asked if he did feel like a ‘scapegoat’ last season,’ he replied: ‘Yes, a little bit.’ But sensitive to where a discussion of the issue might lead him, he then said: ‘That is a difficult question. It is difficult to answer that.’ But it was a difficult time for him too. ‘I agree last season was tough,’ he said. ‘There was a new manager and it was difficult for all the players. ‘My family helped me through it. But I didn’t lose faith in myself. In football you have to be strong in the head. The mentality is important and I do have this quality so I can keep going.’ Fellaini celebrates scoring United's first goal during a 2-2 draw against West Brom in October . The 26-year-old impressed as Louis van Gaal's side held Premier League leaders Chelsea at Old Trafford . Some strong displays for Belgium in the World Cup also helped to heal any mental scars. ‘I was also in the national team for Belgium at the World Cup and I played well and the team also played well,’ he said. ‘For my confidence that was important. ‘I came back after the summer confident. The manager said to me I would have to fight if I wanted to play. I did fight and trained hard and that was it. When I got my chance I tried to show myself and tried to do my best. ‘Last season was a difficult season for me. The World Cup helped me a lot. The manager of the national team and the players helped me and it was a great experience for everybody.’ Fellaini would prefer to move on from a season that became more difficult when Moyes was sacked only 10 months after signing him. ‘David knew my qualities,’ he said. ‘That is why he bought me. He knew what I can do and that is why I am here. But I am happier now I am playing. When you are playing you are always happy. But I have worked hard and I will work hard to play every game.’ The big midfielder is yet to return to the form which made him such a key player for Everton . Fellaini was seen as a scapegoat for David Moyes' (right) poor spell as United manager . The former Everton man spent the majority of last season on the Old Trafford bench . If there was speculation about his future during the summer, Fellaini said he had no doubts he would still be at United this season. ‘It was all speculation,’ he said. ‘In football it is like this. But I signed for Manchester United for four years and the manager never said to me that I had to go, so I worked for my place and that was it. ‘I am fit now and that is why I am better. When I am super fit I will be better I am sure. I was injured earlier this season (he had an ankle injury). They said I had to have surgery but I didn’t. 'It was a bad injury but now I am better and I can look forward. At the moment the manager is using me as a box-to-box player and I am trying to score a goal.’ The Belgian midfielder seems to be flourishing under the guidance of United boss Van Gaal . Fellaini believes an impressive World Cup campaign with Belgium has put him in good shape for the season . He might be operating as a box-to-box midfielder but even after Van Gaal opted for his third formation in 12 matches, Fellaini had to perform two jobs against Palace. Firstly in a more offensive role alongside Wayne Rooney and then in a more defensive one alongside Daley Blind. Asked to explain what he thinks Van Gaal is trying to achieve, Fellaini said: ‘It is about organisation and keeping the ball better. You have to close down when you lose the ball. It is a new philosophy. ‘When you bring in a new manager you have to wait because it is not easy to bring in a new philosophy but we are working hard in training. The manager has a lot of meetings to help us improve so we will see what happens in time. I am more comfortable here now. I know the players and the people who work in the club and that is important.’ Marouane Fellaini was speaking at the screening of ‘HUNGRY TO WIN,’ Japanesee animation created by Nissin, Manchester United’s Official Global Noodle Partner.","Marouane Fellaini had to call on support of his family last season .

"New dad Dave Attwood starts Saturday's eagerly anticipated clash with the All Blacks ready to be more responsible off the field but more reckless on it. Whatever happens on the pitch at Twickenham, the 27-year-old Bath lock has already had the most momentous week of his life after fiancee Bridget gave birth to the couple’s first child, Jessica, on Tuesday night, just hours after he was named in the starting line-up to face the world champions. If baby Jessica had delayed her arrival until later this week there was every chance Attwood, who has won all but two of his 12 caps from the bench, would have missed his chance to stake a World Cup claim; four years after a nine-week stamping ban cost him a place in Martin Johnson’s squad. England second row Dave Attwood posts a photo of himself holding his newborn baby on Twitter . Attwood trains with his England team-mates on Tuesday before he was released to be with his wife . ‘Emotionally I’ve been fighting on two very big battlefields,’ Attwood said. ‘One, being supportive of my fiancee and the birth of our child and doing everything I can to help them out. First child is once-in-a-lifetime isn’t it? You will never get to re-do that. ‘And then obviously the game this weekend holds particular significance for me, even more so now that the most important person in the world is going to be expecting something from it. ‘My first cap was against New Zealand and I’ve come four years on, after some trials and tribulations and a bit of time off the radar, getting back involved. This game is incredibly important to me. ‘Obviously with the next 12 months shaping up as they are, then this is the time to stand up and be counted. I can’t stress how high a price I have put on this game.’ The England second row will line up against New Zealand on Saturday after impressing for Bath . Attwood’s outstanding start to the season for Bath, after shedding almost nine kilos over the past year, has seen the former England schoolboy discus champion add mobility to his game without losing power. Having followed instructions from England’s coaching team on tour in Argentina last year, become a dad for the first time and apparently put his disciplinary issues behind him, the 6ft 7in lock is ready to inflict some pain on his opponents on Saturday after Joe Launchbury’s withdrawal through injury. ‘Coming back from Argentina I decided I wanted to be the most powerful, destructive player I could be,’ Attwood said. The baby was due last Friday and Attwood had been doubtful for Test at Twickenham . ‘To be more than a substitute I had to make a significant change and one of the changes was to lose weight. I wanted anyone that came into my area, or anyone’s area that I went into, to come off second best. ‘I spent a lot of time doing heavy work in the gym, set-piece proficiency, becoming one of the best scrummaging second rows around, working the line-out, setting up mauls; real strengths of mine. ‘I wanted to get moving round the field more. And perhaps a bit more back to when I used to carry the ball with a little less consideration, perhaps to be a little bit more exciting and more reckless. New Zealand ran out narrow 30-22 winners against England at Twickenham nearly a year ago . ‘That’s been the focus this season. It has been the best start to a season ever for me.’ And on top of the weights, Attwood — who, along with prop Dave Wilson, has been given cleaning duties at England’s new Pennyhill Park training facility as part of Stuart Lancaster’s ongoing drive to instil humility in his players — hopes to find an alternative power source over the coming weeks. ‘I had an interesting conversation with (fellow new dad) Danny Care about “dad strength” and how every facet of your life gets a little extra gilt edge,’ he said. ‘Not necessarily in terms of how much you can bench press but the fact you could pull a tree out of the ground and batter someone with it. Not the standard strength tests!’ England: 15 Mike Brown; 14 Semesa Rokoduguni, 13 Brad Barritt, 12 Kyle Eastmond, 11 Jonny May; 10 Owen Farrell, 9 Danny Care; 1 Joe Marler, 2 Dylan Hartley, 3 David Wilson; 4 Dave Attwood, 5 Courtney Lawes; 6 Tom Wood, 7 Chris Robshaw (capt), 8 Billy Vunipola .

"Harry Camilleri, 34, has been jailed for 10 months after stealing £45,000 from 35 customer deposits . A Mercedes-Benz salesman stole £45,000 from 35 customer deposits for luxury cars to fund his online betting addiction. Harry Camilleri, 34, one of the company's highest earners, has been jailed for 10 months after handing himself in to police and admitting theft. The father-of-one had a large portfolio of prestige buyers and earned £65,000 in commission, on top of a £12,000 salary, at the showroom in Manchester city centre. But he squandered his earnings and ran up debts 'chasing the next big win' online betting, Manchester Crown Court heard. Judge Robert Brown refused a defence appeal to suspend Camilleri's sentence so he could start a new job and pay all the money back. Camilleri's systematic thefts went unnoticed for 18 months, until a customer paying for a car questioned why they had been given two separate account numbers by Camilleri in April this year. Confronted by bosses, 'highly trusted' Camilleri told them it was an honest mistake. But the following day he handed in his resignation, and bosses decided to launch an investigation. The day after, Camilleri handed himself in to police and revealed all, telling an officer, 'gambling is my illness'. He admitted deceiving customers into paying deposits into his own account. Camilleri would then transfer some, but not all the money into the company account. By the time he was arrested, he had stolen between £500 and £10,000 from 35 different customers' deposits. Neil Nehra, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant was employed for nine years and was a well-respected salesman. He was described by the management team as one of the high performers of the company.' Manchester Crown Court (pictured) heard how the father-of-one had a large portfolio of prestige buyers and earned £65,000 in commission, on top of a £12,000 salary, but squandered the cash chasing his 'next big win' Camilleri, of Blackpool, has since repaid £10,000 of the money, and had company payments withheld, bringing the balance of the money owed to £26,000. Adrian Palmer, defending, said: 'It's clear there's a long-standing difficulty with addiction to gambling, but he's a man who works extremely hard - a well-paid, well-respected man who has let himself and his family down.' Mr Palmer said Camilleri's relationship with the mother of his young daughter had broken down following the revelations, and so he had to move back in with his parents in Blackpool. He also said that Camilleri had banned himself from online betting accounts as he sought help for his addiction.","Top salesman Harry Camilleri, 34, jailed for 10 months after admitting theft .

"A single mother of four has been forced to crowd-source funding so that she can build a 'bully fence' around her home, which has been pelted with eggs and animal faeces from neighbours tormenting her disabled teenage daughter. Sophie Mason from Farmborough Heights in Wollongong, south of Sydney, says her 15-year-old daughter Faith is constantly bullied for having Downs Syndrome, with adults and children from the are calling the girl a 'retard'. Now the mother has turned to the crowd-funding website gofundme.com to raise $700 for the materials to build a fence and plant protective trees on her home's exposed boundaries to put distance between her family and the neighbourhood bullies. Teenager Faith is being tormented by her neighbours who call her derogatory names and throw eggs at her Farmborough Heights home. Her mum Sophie Mason is raising funds to build a 'bully barrier' around their home . Ms Mason's family even had bicycles stolen and objects set on fire which were left to burn near the front door, reported the Illawarra Mercury. 'They're hurting my feelings,' the teenage blonde said, when asked about the constant attacks. But Ms Mason's efforts to protect her family from the tormentors only seem to make matters worse. 'Now it's a challenge for them to see if they can make me cry,' she said. 'How do I explain this to [Faith]. She's a beautiful girl who doesn't deserve any of this - she hasn't got a nasty bone in her body. It's difficult because she can't go outside and play now.' The 15-year-old (left), who has Down Syndrome, is being bullied for her mental disability. She is pictured with her mum . Ms Mason believes the tyrants who bully Faith are a group of 15 children and three adults from the neighbourhood . It was three years ago when Ms Mason and her four children moved into their Housing NSW property in Warrah Place. At first the family enjoyed an amicable relationship with their neighbours, but it soon turned sour when Ms Mason objected to visiting children swearing and fighting in her house and refused to let them come over. Ms Mason also believes her decision to home-school Faith's three siblings may also have contributed to making them targets for neighbourhood bullies. These incidents were reported to police, but the Masons were told nothing could be done to stop them. So the mother of four took matters into her own hands. The mother of four took to a crowd-sourcing site, gofundme.com, to raise money for a 'bully barrier' around their house . Ms Mason took to crowd-sourcing site gofundme.com last week to raise money for materials after the Department of Housing refused to build the barrier. 'I am raising money to build a bully barrier for my daughter,' she wrote on the website. 'She is an amazing, sparkling, funny young woman. But there are many who would rather tear her down rather than take the time to see how loving and special she is. We are living in an area with many not-so-nice people that are taking away Faith's confidence and her healing smiles. Almost daily she is called a retard and other nasty names. Our home is often pelted with eggs and other objects. We are trying to raise money to build a fence around our garden and plant some fruit trees (to block the missiles).' It appears the mother's plea has touched the hearts of many as the campaign, which aimed to raise $700, had already climbed over $2,000 at the time of publication. It has since gone up to $3,500 and continues to increase. Ms Mason thanked the donors for their 'love and support'. 'The messages and support have given us fresh courage,' she said.

"David Cameron has appealed to former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg to share any information he has about the Islamic State militants behind the capture of Western hostages. Mr Begg has claimed he offered to help the Government secure the release of British hostage Alan Henning from Islamic State (ISIS) extremists but was prevented from issuing a direct appeal. He also said he believed he knew those who held the murdered aid worker and had helped secure the release of hostages from extremists in Syria in the past. Scroll down for video . Pictured left, former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg outside high security Belmarsh prison after he walked free from jail on Wednesday, and right, Prime Minister David Cameron leaving Downing Street . The Prime Minister told BBC's North West Tonight: 'We are very happy to to work with anybody. 'My understanding is that Moazzam Begg did make some appeals, sadly, as we know, those appeals fell on deaf ears. 'If Moazzam Begg has information to provide about who these people are, he should provide it.' The Prime Minister defended the way the Government had handled the IS hostage situation, following criticism from Mr Henning's family that they had been prevented from speaking out about his capture. 'The approach that we take, when these terrible things happen, is to work with the family, to try and find the hostages, but not to raise the media profile of an individual case because it can put that person at even greater risk. Former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg walked free from jail on Wednesday after a string of terrorist charges linked to the civil war in Syria were dramatically dropped. Mr Begg (pictured) has claimed to know who was responsible for holding Mr Henning captive . When asked how he felt about being released from the high security Belmarsh prison after seven months in custody, he told waiting reporters: 'I wanted my day in court but I was very happy.' The 45-year-old was formally acquitted just days before his trial was due to start at the Old Bailey after 'new material' emerged undermining the prosecution case. Begg, who suffers from post traumatic stress, walked free from the high security Belmarsh jail. He had been held in custody since March and was refused bail at a hearing in May despite fears for his mental health. Upon his release, the court heard that Begg was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder from his time in Guantanamo Bay. Alan Henning (pictured) was delivering aid to Syrian refugees last year when he was kidnapped . And some of his symptoms had re-emerged since he has been in custody at Belmarsh, his lawyer Ben Emmerson QC said: 'Theoretically the longer he is in custody the worse there are likely to become.' The 45-year-old appeared before the Old Bailey via video link from high security Belmarsh prison when Mr Justice Wilkie formally acquitted him of all charges. At an earlier hearing he had pleaded not guilty to all the charges. But at a pre-trial review  lasting just five minutes the prosecution dramatically dropped the case. Prosecutor Christopher Hehir said: 'The prosecution in every criminal case of every type have a duty to keep under review the sufficiency of the evidence. 'When Mr Begg was charged with a number of offences earlier this year the Crown Prosecution Service were satisfied there was sufficient evidence to afford prosecution. 'In the months that have followed the prosecution have kept under review the sufficiency of the evidence in this case. 'The prosecution have recently become aware of relevant material and in light of which, after careful and anxious consideration, have reached the conclusion that there is no longer a realistic prospect of conviction in this case. The prosecution therefore offer no evidence.' Police later refused to release details of the newly revealed information, as it would discussing other aspects of the case which would be 'unfair and inappropriate as they are no longer going to be tested in court'.","PM: Moazzam Begg should tell Government what he knows about ISIS killers .

"A 12-year-old girl who gained more than 150lbs in tow years after having a rare brain tumour removed is improving after having a gastric sleeve surgery thanks to a crowd-funding campaign. Alexis Shapiro underwent surgery at the end of March and has since lost 33lbs, and has reversed her diabetes, her mother had said. The tween, from Cibolo, Texas was diagnosed with a rare brain tumour in 2011 and the treatment left her with a condition called hypothalamic obesity. Then and now: On the left is Alexis shortly before she underwent the gastric sleeve surgery, and on the right just under two months later, having lost 33 lbs the change is significant . Alexis, previously a happy and healthy girl of normal weight, gained 151lbs in the space of two years, developing type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related problems. Her parents Jenny, 35, and Ian, 34, found that their insurance did not cover bariatric surgery, so they set up an online crowdfunding campaign and managed to rise more than $86,000 to cover medical expenses. Alexis went under the knife March 21, and in the space of two months, Alexis is now 33lbs lighter,her type 2 diabetes is 'pretty much gone' according to her mother and she no longer needs insulin. At 203lbs, Alexis was also suffering form an enlarged liver, which led to what should have been a gastric bypass to be changed to a gastric sleeve surgery last minute. Now, the dangerously large organ is substantially smaller and her blood chemicals are at normal level. 'I’m so happy with the progress she’s made,' Mrs Shapiro told NBC News. 'She’s the giggling, happy little girl I remember.' Getting there: A recent picture shows Alexis sat cross legged on the floor, something her mother says she has been unable to do for a long time . Lost weight: The Cibolo, Texas tween Alexis Shapiro, pictured this week, went under the knife March 21, and her mom says she's recovering well from the gastric sleeve surgery . Felling better: 'She looks healthier and has more energy,' her mom said. 'The other day she pushed herself to climb three flights of stairs' Sealed with a kiss: Jenny Shapiro is seen giving her daughter, Alexis, a kiss as the 12-year-old is being wheeled into the operating room at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center for her gastric bypass surgery last month . Getting ready: These photos posted on Twitter show surgical instruments being laid out and Drs Inge and Helmrath scrubbing in . Doctors hope the 4'7"" school girl will . lose as much as 50lbs thanks to the surgery, which reduced the size of . her stomach to a quarter of its original size. According to People, . Alexis was booked in for a gastric bypass at Cincinnati Children's . Hospital Medical Center but due to complications they changed tack and . proceeded with sleeve gastrectomy surgery. The 12-year-old still can't have solid foods and gets full very easily, but she is on the road to recovery. 'Of course she wants to be healed and done with everything,' Mrs Shapiro said, 'but each day gets better.' The mom is posting updates on Alexis' shrinking size on Facebook. Alexis' sleeve gastrecomy saw her stomach permanently reduced to 25 per cent of its . original size. Dr Thomas Inge, who headed the team of surgeons in the operating room, explained that they were unable to proceed as planned because Alexis' liver was too stiff and immovable for them to clearly see inside the stomach. Inge said a senior surgeon went out to the waiting area and broke the news to Jenny and Ian Shapiro, Alexis' parents, telling them that they will have to go ahead with a back-up plan. 'They were not disappointed,' the doctor recalled. 'I think they were surprised that we had to go with plan B.' The surgeons were able to nudge Alexis' oversize liver just enough to expose the left side of the stomach and cut away about 80 per cent of it, leaving a narrow 'sleeve' roughly the shape and size of a banana. Before: Alexis, pictured in happier times, was a normal little girl until she had surgery to treat a brain tumor . Young and fit: If Alexis gets the surgery she may be able to lead a normal life again and keep off the weight . 'We were very pleased with the outcome of the operation,' Inge said. 'So it was not disappointing at all.' While the hospital had announced on social media earlier in the day that the gastric bypass will take place at a later time, this afternoon Dr Inge said that the jury is still out on whether or not the surgery will go forward - it will all depend on Alexis' progress. He explained that while sleeve gastrectomy is considered to be an effective and increasingly popular weight-loss option, Alexis may not be able to lose as much weight as with a bypass. If the 12-year-old does manage to shed enough pounds in the first year to 18 months to significantly reduce the size of her fatty liver, her doctors will evaluate her again and weigh all the pros and cons of a second surgery. The operation would entail converting the gastrectomy into a bypass by connecting Alexis' small intestine to her stomach 'sleeve.' 'I think she will have a new normal,' the surgeon said, responding to a question about Alexis' future. The 12-year-old's father, Ian Shapiro, described the experience as a roller coaster ride for their family. According . to her doctors, without the surgery Alexis would have continued putting . on 2lbs a week and eventually become immobile despite a strict daily . regimen comprised of diet and exercise. If her condition was left untreated, Alexis soon would have tipped the scales at whopping 400lbs. The . weight-loss surgery, which diminishes the size of the stomach and . shortens the vagus nerve that control appetite, will help the girl feel . more sated with less food. Health problems: Alexis required medical attention on her way to Ohio (left), and she landed in the ER in February (right) after complaining of chest pains . Step by step: Alexis, pictured here with her parents prior to surgery, remains hospitalized . But the procedure performed on such young a patient is not without its risks, chief among them is the fragility of the metabolic system in children suffering from hypothalamic obesity. Dr Inge estimates that his young . patient will be able to lose 20 per cent of her weight - about 40lbs - . in the first year after the surgery. Alexis' parents, who also have two younger daughters, say they do not consider . the surgery a magic bullet that will solve all of their daughter's . health problems at once. Miracle worker: Doctor Thomas Inge, from Children's Hospital Medical Center, led the team of surgeons who operated on Alexis . Mrs . Shapiro says she simply wants her 12-year-old to be able to ride a bike . like other kids, go swimming with her siblings and walk around without . drawing stares from strangers. The . family said they have been overwhelmed with support from well-wishers . from around the world, who have donated more than $86,000 toward Alexis' medical care, travel costs and living expenses through the Shapiros' online fundraising campaign. Whatever remains of the fund will go towards helping other sick children, Jenny Shapiro said earlier this year. Alexis' life-threatening condition was triggered by surgery she had two years ago to remove a benign brain tumor called craniopharnygioma. During the operation, her hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which help govern appetite and weight, were damaged. She now feels constantly hungry and her weight has caused other medical conditions. After her brain surgery, Alexis' parents had to take extreme measures to keep their daughter from eating herself to death. 'She's always hungry,' her father Ian Shapiro said. 'In the past, we've had to padlock the cupboard.' 'These kids will literally eat themselves to death,' Jenny Shapiro said. 'That's what I'm scared of.' The . outpouring of love and funds on the 'Hope for Alexis' GoFundMe page . gave hope to Alexis, whose condition has caused her to withdraw into her . shell. She is now home-schooled and has no friends. 'I hope this will be the beginning of the end of all of her . pain and insecurities,' Jenny Shapiro wrote in a blog post. 'I hope she won't have to endure another day . feeling like she is starving. I hope she will be able to think about fun . things, not just when she will get to eat next.'","Alexis Shapiro, 12, was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor in 2011 .

Innocent: Camron was completely unhurt in the fall, with his mother receiving all the injuries . Ms Simoes' boyfriend Tyler Strangman has remained by her hospital bed since then, and she has undergone six hours of surgery in a desperate bid to stop her being paralysed for life. Doctors do not currently know whether she will recover, though her family claim they have seen her toes wiggle. The couple lost all their possessions in the fire, but Ms Simoes said she had the one thing that mattered most - her son. Speaking on camera for the first time from her hospital bed, she told WCVB: 'I just knew that we were either going to die or get out of there. Once I got to that window and I looked at what I had to do, I just did it. 'There's no way that my life would be more valuable than his - he's my number one.

All I was thinking about was getting him out of there. He mattered way more than I did. 'I don’t think that I’m any special hero at all. I’m just Camron’s mom.' Well-wishers have set up a GoFundMe page to help Ms Simoes with her medical bills which has already raised more than $13,000. The City of Haverhill has also established a fund for all residents displaced by the fire.

"Tucked away in one of northern New Mexico's pristine mountain canyons is an old log cabin that was the birthplace not of a famous person, but a top-secret mission that forever changed the world. Pond Cabin, along with a nearby small and stark building where the second person died while developing the nuclear bomb, are among a number of structures scattered in and around the modern day Los Alamos National Laboratory that are being proposed as sites for a new national park commemorating the Manhattan Project. It's an odd place for a national park, many admit. Besides the fact that some of the sites are behind the gates to what is supposed to be one of the most secure research facilities in the world, nuclear critics have called the plan an expensive glorification of an ugly chapter in history. National park: The Quonset hut, where the atomic bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki was assembled, is to be opened to the public as part of the new park at Los Alamos, New Mexico . Historical: One of the places to be turned into a national park at the Los Alamos National Laboratory is the 'gun site', where the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima was assembled . ‘It is a debasement of the national parks idea,’ anti-nuclear watchdog Los Alamos Study Group co-founder Greg Mello said when the Interior Department two years ago recommended creating national parks at Los Alamos; Hanford, Washington; and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. He remains opposed to the plan, saying it will not provide a comprehensive picture of the Manhattan Project, and he notes that extensive interpretative museums concerning development of the nuclear bomb already exist. Supporters, however, note that good or bad, the Manhattan Project transformed history. And they argue that key sites that have not already been bulldozed should be preserved and the public should be allowed to visit them. ‘It isn't glorifying anything,’ says Ellen McGehee, historical facilities manager for Los Alamos labs. ‘It's really more a commemoration ... History is what it is. We can't pick and choose what's historically significant.’ 'Danger': Technicians are seen working at Los Alamos Laboratory in the 40s and 50s . Powerful: The fireball of the Trinity blast is seen here on July 16, 1945. Visitors to the park will learn all about America's history of nuclear weapons . The park service, she said, would help people learn about the controversies, the people and the social, political and military legacy surrounding the development of nuclear weapons. ‘There are a lot of emotions rolled up in this story,’ she said. ‘That's why the park service is the best entity to tell this story. They can approach it as an outsider. They have no real interest in how it is told. They can tell it from a national perspective.’ Among the proposed park's biggest supporters are lab workers like McGehee. She has been working since an act was passed in 2004 to study creation of such parks, to help identify and preserve areas in town and within lab property to include. Potential park properties include some buildings in downtown Los Alamos, a town that was essentially created to support the lab, as well as 17 buildings in six ‘industrial sites’ within the lab's fence. 'A lot of emotion': Visitors will learn about how Robert Oppenheimer and General Leslie Groves (center) examined all that remains of a hundred-foot tower, winch and shack that held the Trinity nuclear weapon . Much to learn: The mushroom cloud of the Trinity test in New Mexico, which will be part of the learning experience for visitors to the new park . They include the V-site, where the first atomic bomb to be detonated at the Trinity Site was assembled, as well as the areas where the Little Boy and Fat Man nuclear bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively, were assembled. Also on the list is the Pajarito site, which includes Pond Cabin and the Slotin Building. Pond Cabin had been part of a boys' school and dude ranch that was purchased and taken over to create Los Alamos lab. It was turned into a key plutonium research office after the first so-called ‘criticality accident’ killed physicist Harry Daghlian, prompting officials to move research to the cabin in a more remote area. A few hundred yards away is the Slotin Building, where Louis Alexander Slotin was killed after a slipped screwdriver accidentally began a fission reaction, making him the second casualty of the Manhattan Project. Deaths: The Los Alamos site will have the areas where two physicists were killed during their nuclear bomb research - Harry Daghlian, right, and Louis Alexander Slotin, left . In the works: A scientist inspects the cyclotron machine at Los Alamos in the 50s. Legislation to create the parks at the nation's nuclear sites passed the House and a Senate committee earlier this year . 'Ugly history': A tree stands amid rubble and the shells of buildings after the atomic blast that destroyed Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 . Manhattan Project: The city was built for the purpose of the nuclear bomb. If the proposal is signed into law, the parks would be limited to areas involved in the Manhattan Project that created the first nuclear weapons . Legislation to create the parks at the nation's nuclear sites passed the House and one Senate committee earlier this year. If it is passed and signed into law, the parks would be limited to areas involved in the Manhattan Project that created the first nuclear weapons. But McGehee has also been busy researching and documenting other now closed areas of the lab. For example, during a 70th anniversary commemoration this summer, lab officials took a media tour and workers and their families on tours of what until recently had been secret tunnel where the nation's nuclear stockpile was stored after World War II. ‘It's a fascinating process and really exciting from a historian's point of view,’ McGehee said. ‘It's a weird hometown history.’","Sites at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico are being proposed for a national park .

"More than 100,000 homeowners across the country face an average bill of £15,000 a year thanks to Ed Miliband’s mansion tax, experts said yesterday. The Labour leader told his party conference he would impose the levy on homes worth £2 million to free up billions for the NHS. But the plan has already come under fire from Labour candidates to be London mayor, because the tax will disproportionately affect homeowners in the capital. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband delivers his keynote speech at the Labour Party conference where he announced he would impose a levy on homes worth £2million to free up billions for NHS.  But the plan has already come under fire . One candidate dubbed Mr Miliband’s flagship proposal a ‘tax on London’, while another said it could force elderly people out of their homes. The Labour leader pledged that the threshold for paying the mansion tax will rise in line with average house prices, to ensure that more and more people are affected. But there are fears future Chancellors would be tempted to lower the starting point – so homes worth £1.5 million or even £1 million are dragged into the levy. Labour says the tax – a levy of 1 per cent on the additional value of homes above £2 million – will raise £1.2 billion a year, but property website Zoopla puts the figure at £1.6 billion. Some 96 per cent of this would be paid by homeowners in London and the South East. Overall, the annual levy would hit 108,000 households across the UK – at an average cost of £15,000. But last night Treasury sources said the new tax would raise at least £350 million less than Labour claims because of a planned discount for those who live in high-value homes without enjoying a good income. Up to one in four homeowners could be eligible for protection. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘A mansion tax is a vindictive gesture that will eventually find its way down the property ladder to hit much less expensive homes. Labour leader pledged that the threshold for paying the mansion tax will rise in line with average house prices . ‘As with stamp duty, future Chancellors will be tempted to lower thresholds or freeze rates while house prices go up. This kind of on-the-hoof policy is nothing more than a populist gesture, but it will be extremely damaging for families up and down country.’ There is unease among London mayoral candidates that the tax will harm Labour’s chances in the 2016 election and boost the Tory candidate who stands to succeed Boris Johnson. The Zoopla statistics show that almost 85,500 homes worth £2 million are in the capital – 88 per cent of the total. In London, the average price of a home above £2million is £3.7 million, meaning the average annual bill would be £16,800. Possible candidate Diane Abbott MP dubbed Mr Miliband’s flagship proposala ‘tax on London’ By contrast, just 895 homes in Scotland and 87 in Wales will be affected. Laurence Hall, from Zoopla, said: ‘The introduction of a mansion tax would disproportionately penalise homeowners in London and the South East who are already responsible for the vast majority of property tax take in the UK.’ The front-runner for Labour’s mayoralty candidacy, MP Tessa Jowell, attacked the mansion tax plan when it was mooted late last year. ‘I represent a constituency where it would be an issue for some people,’ she said. ‘They are people who bought homes maybe 20 or 30 years ago for a fraction of what they are worth now. They are people maybe becoming elderly who are asset-rich and income-poor. It’s fine to say we’ll impose a mansion tax, but for these people they would have to move out of their family homes.’ Diane Abbott, another possible candidate, said the proposal felt ‘like a tax on London’, while Tottenham MP David Lammy – who has already launched his campaign – said it was ‘clearly a tax on London’. The property industry came out strongly against the proposal. Rob Perrins, managing director of the Berkeley Group, said: ‘Imposing a mansion tax on London does not make sense. It will reduce house-building and limit growth. It is a tax on aspiration.’ A Labour source said it was likely that people would self-assess whether their home was worth more than £2 million, with this being checked by the HMRC. Further details of the mansion tax will be unveiled in the months ahead. Ed Miliband will fall victim to his own mansion tax – because he lives in a house worth £2.6 million. The four-bedroom semi-detached home in North London was bought five years ago for £1.6 million. Along with his wife Justine Thornton, Mr Miliband bought the townhouse with a £400,000 mortgage. He contributes to the loan repayments, but his name is not on the deeds. According to property website Zoopla, it is now worth £2.6 million, meaning the couple face a mansion tax of £6,000 a year.","Ed Miliband told party conference he would impose levy on £2m homes .

"Latin American cities have the most dangerous transport systems for women, according to a new survey. Colombia's capital Bogota, that has no city train system but a network of red buses, was found to have the most unsafe public transport in a poll conducted by YouGov. The poll of 15 of the world's largest capitals and New York, the most populous US city, found Bogota was followed in the list by Mexico City, Lima, and then Delhi. Scroll down for video . Colombia's capital Bogota, a city that has no city train system but a network of red buses, was found to have the most unsafe public transport for women in a poll conducted by YouGov . The survey of more than 6,550 women and gender experts ranked Moscow as the worst European capital, coming ninth in the list, with women lacking confidence that authorities would investigate reports of abuse. Paris came 11th, with those questioned saying they had little confidence that other passengers would help a woman in trouble. New York was rated the best of the 16 cities, followed by Tokyo, the world's largest capital with 38 million people, then Beijing and London. The study was commissioned by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, with a minimum of 380 responses from each city between August and September this year. More than six out of 10 women in Mexico City, 64 percent, said they had experienced some type of physical harassment on public transport . The female participants were asked six questions focussing on their experiences of travelling alone at night on buses, trains or trams. They were asked about the risk of being verbally harassed by men, the risk of being groped or physically harassed, their trust in whether other passengers would assist a woman being abused, trust in authorities to investigate reports of sexual harassment or violence and the availability of safe public transport. The YouGov survey of more than 6,550 women and gender experts ranked Peru's capital Lima as the third worst city when it came to women's safety on public transport . Mexico City, the world's third largest capital with 21 million people, fared worst when women were asked if they were at risk of verbal or physical abuse on public transport. More than six out of 10 women in Mexico City, 64 percent, said they had experienced some type of physical harassment on public transport. After the Latin American cities and Delhi, the fifth worst in the list was Jakarta, followed by Buenos Aires, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Moscow, Manila, Paris and Seoul. By contrast only three out of 10 women surveyed in New York said they had suffered any kind of verbal or physical harassment while using the city's extensive subway system and buses. After the Latin American cities, New Delhi was the next worst on the list of the world's largest cities with the most unsafe transport systems for women . The female participants were asked six questions focusing on their experiences of travelling alone at night on buses, trains or trams. Jakarta in Indonesia came fifth in the survey . Women in Moscow ranked the Russian capital as worst when it came to confidence in authorities investigating harassment. Seoul in South Korea ranked 12th in the overall survey but fared worst when women were asked how confident they were that other passengers would assist a woman in trouble. New York has transformed its subway and bus system in the past 25 years and the Metropolitan Transit Authority figures released this year showed subway usage at 1.7 billion in the preceding 12 months, the highest in 60 years. The city was hailed for its growing network of CCTV security cameras on streets and transit lines, interactive Help Point communications kiosks, and obvious police presence. Women in Moscow ranked the Russian capital as worst when it came to confidence in authorities investigating harassment . The study was commissioned by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, with a minimum of 380 responses from each city between August and September this year. Buenos Aires came sixth on the list . The Chow Kit monorail station in Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia are among the countries who have introduced women-only sections on public transport along with Indonesia, Egypt and the Philippines . Tokyo was rated second for safety, which experts attributed to a raft of measures taken in the city in recent years to combat groping of women in often overcrowded buses and trains. 1.

Tokyo was one of the first major capitals to introduce women-only trains in 2000, colour-coding these areas in pink with well-displayed signs and transit police to enforce rules. Women-only sections on public transport are now also found in Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Delhi, Cairo and Manila. The survey questioned women from 15 of the United Nations list of 20 largest capitals six questions about their perception of safety on public transport. Polling could not be conducted in five of the largest capitals - Cairo, Dhaka, Kinshasa, Tehran and Baghdad - due to conflict or YouGov and its polling partners being unable to guarantee the necessary online sample of women. The US capital Washington DC was not included in the list of largest capitals, but New York was added to the survey to provide comparison as it is the United States' most populous city with more than 8.4million people. Mary Crass, head of policy at the International Transport Forum, said it was worrying that women were scared to use public transport in some major cities. 'When there is not frequent, reliable, accessible transport, this can affect women and anyone's ability to access opportunity and notably employment in urban areas, which can make a big difference for women in particular,' she said. New York's public transport system was rated as being the safest for women of the 16 cities surveyed, followed by Tokyo, the world's largest capital with 38 million people, then Beijing and London . London's transport system was rated among the safest for women among the world's largest cities . 'Women tend to be more reliant on public transport, particularly in low income or middle-income countries, in emerging economies.' The mayor of Bogota defended his administration's efforts to tackle high levels of sexual harassment of women on buses in the Colombian capital, following the results of the report being published. Mayor Gustavo Petro said the number of reports of sexual assaults had declined 'dramatically' following a series of measure aimed at improving safety for women on the capital's main red bus system, known as TransMilenio. 'The strategy consists in units of trained undercover policewomen going into buses and stations during the day and seeing who is committing the assaults,' he said. 'Immediately, they are arrested. This strategy is to mitigate the risk of sexual harassment on TransMilenio and what's certain is that the results to date, since the strategy was implemented two-and-half months ago, show sexual harassment in terms of the number of reports filed has declined dramatically.'","Bogota, Mexico City and Lima are the most unsafe according to YouGov poll .

"EasyJet has unveiled a new passport-scanning facility on its smartphone app, meaning passengers no longer have to manually type in their details when checking in online. The new facility allows travellers flying with the budget airline to complete the check-in process by simply taking a picture of their passports. The upgrade to their award-winning mobile app service, which is available on both iOS and Android phones, means customers can now book, check-in and board flights all via their mobile phone. easyJet has unveiled a new passport-scanning facility on its smartphone app, meaning passengers no longer have to manually type in their details when checking in online . Previously, passengers were required to provide Advanced Passenger Information (API) by manually entering their passport number into the easyJet website after booking their flights. The new facility, operated by validation specialist Jumio, now let users automate the process up to two hours before taking off from one of easyJet's 110 airports. EasyJet is the first European airline to have such a feature. They says it worked with Jumio on the new service to ensure all customer passports could be recorded 'easily, safely and securely'. The airline's app, which was recently awarded the Best Mobile Booking Solution prize at the Mobile Travel and Tourism Awards 2014, has already been downloaded more than ten million times. James Millett, easyJet's Head of Digital, said: 'Our new mobile passport scanning function will save time for the millions of customers who use the app to input their travel documentation details. The new smartphone app has been designed to help easyJet streamline their check-in services . 'It's another example of innovating to make travel as easy as it is affordable with easyJet. 'We've developed the new function in partnership with credentials management service Jumio to ensure details can be scanned in easily, safely and securely.' 'EasyJet is committed to making travel easier, and this year alone launched a partnership with flightradar24 to track flights on the move and introduced a live update system to connect with travellers.' Earlier this year, easyJet introduced a new mobile phone service to take passengers through each step of the airport process. The budget airline began trialling new technology across Luton, Gatwick and Paris Charles de Gaulle airports, with special beacons placed at strategic points to send helpful messages to customers at what it calls 'critical points' of the journey. Passengers were previously required to enter their Advanced Passenger Information on the easyJet website . easyJet is the first European airline to offer the passport-scanning service . As customers approach bag drop, they are advised to open their boarding pass at the right time so it is ready to be scanned and further beacons will send messages to travellers when it is time to present their passport. The instructions are sent to registered passengers' mobile phones as they pass each strategic 'beacon' placed in the airports. Any passenger who has downloaded the easyJet app can expect 'helpful' notifications each time they pass the Bluetooth transmitters dotted around the airport. And the airline deems the trial successful, customers can expect to receive messages at more European airports telling them when to open their passports and show their boarding pass. easyJet already uses Flight Tracker technology in its app to keep customers up to date with the latest information on their flights.","easyJet is the first European airline to offer the passport scanning feature .

"The Russian city where the Red Army decisively turned back Nazi forces in a landmark Second World War battle will once again be known as Stalingrad to mark the anniversary of the defeat. The local government in Volgograd has decided to revive the name tomorrow, on the anniversary of the end of one of the bloodiest battles in history, along with five other key dates in the Russian military calendar. The city was renamed Volgograd in 1961 as part of the Soviet Union's rejection of dictator Joseph Stalin's personality cult, but the name Stalingrad remains synonymous with the battle. The decision to bring back the title, just for one day, as prompted fury from critics who say it is an insult to the memory of the almost 2 million people who lost their lives. Controversial: Joseph Stalin's name and legacy remains a source of fiery disputes in Russia more than half a century after his death . Almost 60 years after his death, Stalin's name and legacy continues to cause fiery disputes in Russia. Russia's human rights ombudsman Vladimir Lukin sharply criticized the move, saying it should be declared void by court. 'This is an insult of the memory of those who died,' he said, according to the Interfax news agency. Nikolai Levichev, a senior federal lawmaker with the leftist Just Russia party, condemned the restoration of the old city name, saying 'it's blasphemous to rename the great Russian city after a bloody tyrant who killed millions of his fellow citizens'. Mr Levichev added that the country won the war 'despite rather than thanks to' Stalin's leadership, whose errors multiplied the Soviet losses.Stalin led the Soviet Union from 1924 until his death in 1953. Communists and other hardliners credit him with leading the country to victory in World War II and making it a nuclear superpower, while others condemn his brutal purges that killed millions of people. Stalingrad: The World War II battle was one of the bloodiest in history, with a combined death toll of close to two million people . President Vladimir Putin, a former KGB officer, has avoided open public praise or criticism of Stalin, but he has restored Soviet-era symbols and tried to soften public perceptions of the dictator. Kremlin critics have seen attempts to whitewash Stalin's image as part of Putin's rollback on democracy.In recent years, many in Russia were outraged by government-sponsored school textbooks that painted Stalin in a largely positive light and the reconstruction of a Moscow subway station that restored old Soviet national anthem lyrics praising Stalin as part of its interior decoration.In addition to the Volgograd legislature's move to restore the old name of the city, authorities in Volgograd, St. Petersburg and the Siberian city of Chita ordered images of Stalin to be put on city buses on February 2 to commemorate the historic battle.Yan Raczynski of Memorial, a leading Russia's human rights group, was quoted as saying by Interfax that the authorities' moves highlighted the nation's failure to 'legally and politically recognize the crimes committed by the Bolshevik regime, particularly Stalin and his inner circle'.In turn, communists said the decision to restore the name of Stalingrad for just a few days each year is just a half-step. Communist lawmakers met with World War II veterans and sent a letter to Putin urging the government to fully rename the city, the party said in a statement.But Sergei Zheleznyak, a top lawmaker with United Russia, the main Kremlin party dominating parliament, said there were no plans to fully restore the old name.Tomorrow Russia plans extensive ceremonies to mark the 70th anniversary of the battle, which raged for half a year in 1942-43 with the Red Army resisting the Nazi onslaught in fierce street fighting and then encircling and capturing more than 100,000 Nazi soldiers. Volgograd council has restored the name for six days a year. The dates, all associated with military commemorations, are 2 February, 9 May, 22 June, 23 August, 2 September and 19 November.","Volgograd will once again be named Stalingrad on six military holidays .

"A  mother has described the torment of having a son with severe ADHD, admitting that if he were an animal, she would have him put down. Jenny Young has four children aged 25, 23, 19 and 10 and astonishingly, not only have they all been diagnosed with the behavioural disorder, but she too was told she had it in her mid-forties. But it is her youngest child Ryan, 10, who suffers with the most extreme symptoms of the condition as well as severe learning disabilities, subjecting Jenny to daily violent attacks. She said that because she is his mother, and not a pet owner, she must put up with it. Scroll down for the video . Jenny Young's son Ryan suffers with ADHD and severe learning disabilities. She said that his unpredictability makes life difficult and sometimes dangerous, as he subjects  her to daily, violent attacks . Jenny explained that she is the main target of his frustration and that if Ryan, who has the mental age of a two-year-old, were her husband they would have divorced by now. She added that people should not judge her for her comments until they have heard her story. Jenny said that she used the example . of putting a dog down because she has a member of the family who went . through the traumatic experience of having their dog euthanised after they could not control its violence. 'It was a horrendous traumatic . experience for the whole family. They worked really, really, hard and . did everything they could possibly do for [the dog]. 'They spent lots of money and put lots of effort in and ultimately they had the choice to have her put down. 'I don't liken Ryan and the dog . exactly but there is a choice. When you have a dog that behaves . [violently] and might attack you any minute, you have a choice. 'I wouldn't be without Ryan but [ I . was trying to make the point] that when you're the mother of a child . like Ryan there is no choice. There isn't a refuge for battered mums - . you have to get on with it. Jenny says that although much of the time Ryan (pictured) is 'gorgeous', he attacks her at least once a day, often scratching, punching and biting when she goes to give him a cuddle . Jenny made the startlingly frank . comments on ITV's This Morning. Her oldest son was diagnosed with ADHD when he was ten. Before then people excused his behaviour as 'just being a boy'. Jenny said: 'It was a relief [when he was diagnosed] because he wasn't just being naughty.' She then went on to recognise the same traits in her other children. Jenny said she loves her son dearly but that unlike pet owners, mothers of disabled children do not have a choice about their situation . Jenny added that her late diagnosis of ADHD has helped her to relate to her children and ultimately to cope with her situation. She said: 'If you've got an ADHD mind it's difficult to to understand those who don't have an ADHD mind.' But at times she says it has been very difficult to cope, especially when all four children were little. Her first marriage broke down in the mid-Nineties but in 2002 she remarried. Jenny, who had always wanted to be a mother, said she hadn't expected to have any more children. She added that she knew that Ryan would have problems from very early on: 'You could tell from the scans that there would be something wrong, but we didn't know what. He was developing very slowly and was tiny.' Ryan was delivered by Caesarean section at 38 weeks and weighed just 3lb 11oz when he was born. From then on he developed very slowly, both physically and mentally. Due to the strain that Ryan's problems put on her marital relationship, Jenny's second marriage broke down in 2008 and the couple divorced. Jenny said that she grieved for Ryan when he was diagnosed with ADHD and severe learning difficulties. 'You don't love your child any less but it's a bit like going on holiday and not arriving in the place you expected. It's a lovely place, but not what you expected.' Jenny went on to explain that 99 per cent of the time Ryan is adorable but that for that one per cent of the time he is violent and unpredictable. 'And I think most parents would say same thing. There are two sides to him. The biggest problem is the unpredictability. Jenny Young (right) made her shocking admission on ITV's This Morning, speaking to Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield (left) about living with a child suffering with severe learning disabilities and ADHD . 'He can be gorgeous all day and then I can squat down to give him a cuddle and he might bite me or scratch me or knock my glasses off or punch me. 'At least every day I get punched in the face.' But Jenny explained you can't approach Ryan as he is going to attack him and must still cuddle him . 'You have to go in expecting a cuddle.' Jenny said that sounds tend to trigger Ryan's violent outbursts, with modem hand dryers being the main culprit. 'Simply changing routine can cause him to become upset but sometimes it can be nothing,' she added. Jenny, who once worked part-time in an office, but has since dedicated herself to working as Ryan's full-time carer, says she thinks about the future and says that Ryan's behaviour could go either way. 'Maybe he will learn to express himself better and maybe it will all get better. The worst fear is that he won't get better and he will be same size as me and do even more damage.' Jenny described the lack of help provided for parents of children with ADHD and learning difficulties . Jenny went to on to describe the lack of help provided for parents of children with ADHD and learning difficulties. 'Unfortunately professionals don't always believe you [about your situation] and it can be very difficult to get the level of support needed. 'When you're a mum and you tell them you've tried everything and you're at your wit's end, specialists tend to keep offering other things rather than giving level of support needed.' 'There is help but you have to fight for it and shout loud and even be seen crying. 'Schools and social workers can help but no one will come along will say to you ""You look like you're having a difficult time - do you need some help?""' Attention .

Symptoms of ADHD tend to be first noticed at an early age, and may become more noticeable as a child grows up.

"With his arms around the shoulders of two vicious gangsters, it is not a portrait of the ideal family man. This picture unearthed by the Mail of Mark Duggan – whose death sparked the 2011 riots – suggests his links with the criminal underworld are deeper than first thought. Following his death his supporters claimed he was an innocent father assassinated by police. All three pictured were members of the notorious Man Dem gang which had links to Jamaica's ruthless Yardies . But to Duggan’s right in the picture is Junior Cameron, a career criminal serving a life sentence for shooting a man after a minor prang between their cars. Cameron pulled a semi-automatic pistol on Gary Guthrie in Streatham, South London, and shot him in the back as he tried to escape. The 39-year-old died in hospital. Cameron committed the murder in October 2007 – six months after being freed early from prison. The man to Duggan’s left is Darrell Albert, who was in the same car as Cameron that night. During the confrontation he shot Mr Guthrie’s friend Rowan Williams with a Baikal 9mm pistol – now the weapon of choice for gangsters. Duggan was known by his gangster name Starrish Mark and was considered to be a 'major player' in the gang . The death of Mark Duggan sparked the 2011 riots which began in Tottenham in London . Violence erupted across London as rioters set fire to cars, bins and buildings and hurled missiles at police following the death of Mark Duggan . Rampage: This building in Tottenham was destroyed by fire started by rioters . Mr Williams, 37, took a bullet in the neck but it was removed by surgeons and he survived. Cameron, Albert and Duggan were all members of the notorious Tottenham Man Dem gang, which has links to Jamaica’s ruthless Yardies. Duggan was known by his gangster name of Starrish Mark and was considered by police to be a ‘major player’ in the gang. Others said Duggan ‘lived by the gun’. One source said: ‘I was told he was a major player and well known to the police in Tottenham. He was certainly not a sideshow.’ Duggan was shot after he had been placed under surveillance by police on August 4, 2011. An officer said he opened fire because Duggan had a gun and appeared to be preparing to use it. Procession: Funeral cortege of Mark Duggan passes through Tottenham on September 9, 2011 . Respect: Row of men give one-armed salute as funeral procession passes through Broadwater farm . Criminal links: Duggan was shot after he had been placed under surveillance by police on August 4, 2011 . The account was given at the trial of Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, 30, who was yesterday found guilty of supplying a gun to Duggan after a retrial at the Old Bailey. The prosecution told the court Duggan and Hutchinson-Foster exchanged phone calls in the hour before the weapon was collected. The handover took place 15  minutes before he was shot. Despite Duggan’s criminal links, his family still insist he was assassinated by police. They want to know why the gun he was supposed to be holding when he was shot was found some 16ft from his body in nearby bushes. Duggan’s elder brother Shaun Hall said: ‘As much as this police officer is 100 per cent sure that his life was in danger, I will go on record and say I’m 100 per cent sure that his life was not in danger or any of his colleagues.’ An inquest into Duggan’s death, which was supposed to start this week, is expected to begin in September.

"A businessman who vanished for eight months has turned up again, claiming he was kidnapped and tortured by Russian gangsters and  the IRA. Kevin McGeever had the word ‘thief’ carved into his forehead, apparently with a penknife. An Irish property developer during the country’s economic boom, Mr McGeever, 68, claims to have been imprisoned in a cargo container for months – because he owed the criminal gangs money. 'Tortured': Kevin McGeever, pictured at a gala dinner in Castlebar, Ireland, claimed he was kidnapped by Russian gangsters and the IRA . He lost five stone during his ordeal and was left with long hair, a beard and three-inch fingernails. He was found wandering barefoot at . night on a remote country road in Co Leitrim in the Republic of Ireland . near the border with Ulster. He is now in hospital under armed guard. Disorientated: Catherine Vallely picked up a bedraggled Mr McGeever when she saw him wandering barefoot on the road . The woman who found him said he told her that he had been thrown from a van. Catherine Vallely said he was  ‘very well-educated, well-spoken and polite’. She added: ‘We were told he used to be 16 and a half stone but he is just skin and bones now.’ Mrs Vallely, 64, said: ‘He had a pair . of enormous eyes in a very thin face and his cheek-bones stuck out. He . was rubbing his beard with fingers that had long nails. ‘When he got into the car he said he had no shoes on. ‘I said he could have been killed in . the middle of the road, and he said three men had just thrown him out of . a van. I thought he might have Alzheimer’s disease or something like . that. ‘The man said his name was Kevin and he didn’t realise he was in County Leitrim. ‘He didn’t even know the month, the day or the time.’ Miss Vallely said she gave him a lift . because, ‘there are hippy campers and a Buddhist centre in [nearby] . Ballinamore and I sometimes pick them up.’ Mr McGeever was being treated for dehydration and malnutrition in Mullingar General Hospital. The businessman was in such an . unkempt state when found  – just before 10pm on Tuesday – that the . carving on his forehead was not noticed at first. Successful: Mr McGeever's home, 'Nirvana', in Craughwell, Galway. He is understood to have owned properties in Dubai during Ireland's boom years . Mr McGeever told police that his . captors gave him a mobile phone when he was released and told to keep it . with him at all times – though why is unclear. During the boom times in Ireland – . the era of the so-called Celtic Tiger economy from 1995 to 2007 – Mr . McGeever sold luxury homes in Dubai to wealthy clients, including some . from Britain. He also owned one of Ireland’s . biggest mansions, a £3million property which was nicknamed Nirvana by . locals in the west of the country and is surrounded by immaculate lawns. He drove a Porsche and travelled in a helicopter which had his initials KMM emblazoned across it. Mr McGeever was reported missing from . his Galway home last May by his partner Siobhán O’Callaghan. Apparently . there was a ransom demand for his safe return. Police last night said they were looking into ‘every aspect’ of the case and could not yet confirm any of Mr McGeever’s claims. After he was taken to a police station, the tycoon was given a portion of curry chips. A police spokesman said he was expected to remain in hospital.","Property developer Kevin McGeever was found wandering barefoot on a remote country road in Co Leitrim, Ireland .

"The Dark Knight gunman sent a notebook filled with details and drawings about how he was going to kill people to his university psychiatrist one week before the shooting - but it sat unopened in the campus mail room. The revelation will undoubtedly lead many to come to the awful conclusion the massacre could have been prevented and 12 lives could have been spared. A law enforcement source told Fox News that the package was only discovered on Monday but they suspect it had lain there undetected since July 12. Bizarre behavior: James Holmes, pictured at his first court appearance on Monday, was involved with a number of prostitutes in the months before the massacre . No sense: Students and faculty who knew Mr Holmes from the University of Colorado at Denver scrambled via e-mail to make sense of the shooting . Bomb scare: Although that package turned out to be from someone else and harmless, a search of the Campus Services' mailroom turned up another package . Disturbing: A poster on the wall is seen inside the apartment where accused killer James Homes lived . James Holmes' name was written in the return address box. The package was turned up after an extensive search of the campus' mail room. It is not known why it was not delivered to its intended recipient. Authorities then obtained a warrant from a district judge to open the package, which is when its chilling contents were discovered. Respectable family: Holmes's father Robert Holmes is a talented scientist who works for a financial services company in San Diego . The source told Fox: 'Inside the package was a notebook full . of details about how he was going to kill people. 'There were drawings of what he was going to do in it - . drawings and illustrations of the massacre.' The spiral-bound pad was said to be filled with gun-wielding stick figures blowing away other stick figures. The notebook is now in the possession of the FBI but it has fueled speculation that an earlier discovery could have prevented the senseless tragedy which unfolded at a Colorado movie theater less than a week ago. Police and FBI agents were called to the University of Colorado's Anschutz medical campus in Aurora on Monday morning after the psychiatrist and professor at the school reported receiving a package believed to be from the suspect. Though the package in question turned out to be from someone else, this prompted an extensive search of the campus mail room which uncovered the notebook. It is not yet clear whether or not the psychiatrist had any previous contact with Holmes but it is likely, considering that the 24-year-old studied various mental health issues before he dropped out of the university's neuroscience program. The psychiatrist was also a professor at the college. The New York Daily News reported today that Holmes asked a prison guard if he had watched The Dark Knight Rises yet and how the film ended. The 24-year-old bought a ticket to the midnight screening but allegedly left after half an hour to put on the body armor stored in his care before returning to the theater and opening fire. A jail employee told the Daily News that Holmes's voice was flat and his eyes glazed over when he asked, and repeated the question when he was ignored.

Tears for victims: Family members depart after a memorial service for Gordon Cowden, pictured right, which took place today in Denver . A sad day: Movie-theater-shooting-victim Gordon Cowden's family walk out of the Pathways Church Denver after a memorial service on July 25, 2012 in Denver, Colorado . The 24-year-old bought a ticket to . the midnight screening but allegedly left after half an hour to put on . the body armor stored in his care before returning to the theater and . opening fire. When I knew James Holmes, the Colorado shooter, he was Jimmy. I was his fifth-grade teacher and he lives in a tiny town of 5,000 called Castroville. Recalling him at school, he was well-dressed, neat, wore glasses, liked to read and excelled in all academic areas. He had two really good friends, both sharp like him — in fact, top of the class. What happened to him? James had everything going for him. He lived in the wealthy part of town; I’m pretty sure both of his parents had white-collar jobs. How can we know what happened ?” IPerhaps he became psychotic. It shows up in people in their 20s. Maybe he used wicked sanity-eating drugs like OxyContin, meth, crack, and it destroyed his mind. I don’t know. Some people will always snap. They’ll commit crimes of passion, commit dark acts under the influence of drugs, anger, lust, misperception, racism, ignorance and poor or wrong decision making. I fear that in schools somewhere out there, more people like James Holmes are festering. Paul Karrer teaches elementary school in Castroville, California. He spoke to the New York Post . A jail . employee told the Daily News that Holmes's voice was flat and his eyes . glazed over when he asked, and repeated the question when he was . ignored. 'He was trying to look like he was sincerely curious. Like he had no idea why there was anything wrong with what he was saying. It was sick...I think he’s trying real hard to act crazy.' Holmes remains in solitary confinement in the Arapahoe County Detention Center. He was moved to the infirmary Tuesday for his own protection, sources told The News. Prison officials fitted him with a black plastic face guard to stop him from spitting on guards. It emerged today that three days . before he dropped out of university, Holmes failed a key exam, prompting him to buy a . terrifying arsenal of weapons. Experts . have suggested that it may have been the stress of failing the exam . coupled with the pressure to follow in his brilliant father's over-achieving . footsteps . which triggered an underlying mental illness. Robert Holmes, 61, has degrees from Stanford, UCLA and Berkeley and currently works as a senior scientist at FICO in San Diego. Holmes' fifth grade elementary school teacher wrote a letter to the New York Post wondering what had happened to his former student he recalled as being sharp, neat, well-dressed and top of the class. He laments as to how or why he suddenly snapped when he came from such a normal, stable background. Questions: Holmes has been uncooperative since . arriving at jail, which is at odds with the man who told police his had . rigged his apartment with explosives (pictured) after his arrest . Explosive: More than 30 homemade grenades, ten gallons of gasoline, improvised explosive devices (IED's) and trip wires or trigger mechanisms were secured from the apartment . Police believe the attack was meticulously planned and Holmes had been collecting and storing the weaponry - which included 6,000 rounds of ammunition and several automatic rifles and hand guns - months in advance. It is also believed that the Century 16 theater was not his original intended target. The National Enquirer reported that an initial police investigation showed the Colorado gunman planned on traveling . to New York City for the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises so he could . shoot dead the stars of the movie. University of Colorado spokeswoman Jacque Montgomery told Fox she was not aware of the contents of the package or who had sent it.

"Parents’ stress levels are 30 per cent higher as they wake and anticipate the looming school run, new research suggests. Levels of cortisol – the stress hormone – go on to peak at 8.15am as mothers and fathers head out of the door. Chartered psychologist, Dr Simon Moore, analysed saliva samples from parents involved in the school run at five points throughout the day to study how well they coped. Stress factor: Almost a third of parents with children of school age, said the school run could ‘mess up timings for the rest of the day’ He found that lingering stress affected them whether they returned home after dropping their children at school or headed to work. The ‘stress hangover’ continued until around 2.30pm on average, according to the study, involving ten parents, for Allianz Insurance. Dr Moore said: ‘Making sure parents are feeling as little stress as possible before they start the drive to school is crucial to ensuring road safety on the school run and there are lots that can be done to relieve stress. ‘Many stressed people don’t get enough sleep and taking the chance to ‘switch off’ and get an extra half an hour in bed can work wonders. Laughing also releases stress busting hormones that will help every family member to feel a bit better about the morning routine.’ Francesca Keefe of Allianz Insurance added: ‘We know that stress has a negative impact on driving behaviour and with over half (55 per cent) of the UK’s children travelling to school by car it’s important that parents are doing what they can to relieve any unnecessary stress before they get behind the wheel.’ Rushing: Parents' stress levels peak at 8.15am for mothers and fathers in the UK, and the ‘stress hangover’ continued until around 2.30pm on average . The company surveyed 1,000 parents with children between the ages of five and 15. Almost a third (30 per cent) said the school run could ‘mess up timings for the rest of the day’. One in four admitted it ‘sets their mood for the rest of the day – good or bad’. Parents felt the best thing about the school run was spending time with their children (39 per cent), hearing about their day on the way home (36 per cent) and being organised and on time (29 per cent). Allianz Insurance also worked with Emily Leary, author of parenting and lifestyle blog, A Mummy Too, to create tips for families on the school run this week. She said: ‘Put shoes, bags and coats in a reliable place upon arriving home so that there’s never the last minute panic as you hunt for a missing shoe. ‘Create a devoted drawer in each child’s chest of drawers for school uniform so they always know where to look when they are getting ready. ‘Make it the house rule that the kids have to have their uniforms on before they come down for breakfast. ‘Always check book bags after tea, to avoid missing school trip slips, or panic to make a World Book Day outfit in 30 minutes. ‘Create a shared family calendar, either on the wall, or on your phones/ computers so that everyone is always aware of changes and variations to the usual routine. ‘Once you’re ready to leave, have a little race to see who can get their shoes and coats on the fastest. This motivates the children to get off the sofa and to the door.’","Stress levels peak at 8.15am for mothers and fathers in the UK .

"Since the 1930s, car makers have experimented with a host of features to give their models a unique selling point. Yet some were so weird, and in some cases, dangerous that they never really took off. This included glovebox minibars that kept tumblers in place using magnets, a steering wheel with a spike that could impale the driver, record players built into the dashboard and a sack that carried dogs alongside the vehicle. This magnetic minibar was a standard feature of the 1957 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham. It featured a magnetised glovebox door and a set of four metal shot tumblers that were designed to stay put when turning corners and prevent drinks being spilt . The 1956-1959 Chryslers were fitted with a record player. The records didn't last very long because the stylus was designed to press down on them hard to prevent skipping, which damaged the vinyl and didn't always stop the tracks from skipping anyway . This collection of bizarre car inventions was put together by car fanatics site Jalopnik. The magnetic minibar was a standard feature of the 1957 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham. Limousines of the time were fitted with bars but the Eldorado Brougham was the first car to have one built-in. It featured a magnetised glovebox door and a set of four metal shot tumblers that were designed to stay put when turning corners. Many of the Chryslers produced between 1956 and 1959 were fitted with a record player. The records didn't last very long because the stylus was designed to press down on them hard to prevent skipping, which damaged the vinyl. According to car fan Michael Ballaban, the players used in the Chryslers only played specially designed records, which meant that there wasn't a huge catalogue of albums to choose from. He also said that even with the pressure from the stylus, the tracks would still skip if the car went around a corner or over a pothole.

"The former wife of an SAS sniper has sensationally claimed that she was paid cash to buy her silence about his astonishing accusation that Princess Diana was murdered by the elite regiment. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons but who we will call Sarah, says she was given a brown envelope stuffed with bank notes by an SAS officer who told her to ‘keep quiet about Diana’. The sniper’s claim that the SAS was ‘behind’ Princess Diana’s death emerged last year at the court martial of Sergeant Danny Nightingale, who was found guilty of illegally possessing a handgun and ammunition. In hiding: The ex-wife of Soldier N says she now fears for her own safety after claiming to have been threatened by an SAS officer . Yesterday, speaking for the first time about her ‘nightmare’ marriage to the sniper known as Soldier N – who made the claim – 40-year-old Sarah revealed that: . Sarah, who is in hiding as she now fears for her own safety, said: ‘The threatening and sinister way that the SAS dealt with me made what my husband had said about the regiment’s role in Diana’s death all the more believable. ‘I had never been handed £500 before and told to keep quiet about the payment and what it was for. ‘They wanted me to keep quiet about . Diana and SAS operations. But I couldn’t stay silent about something so . serious.  The payment was deeply suspicious and made me very . uncomfortable.’ Soldier . N’s claim that the SAS killed Princess Diana was made in a letter . written by the woman’s mother to the regiment’s Commanding Officer (CO) in September 2011. Sergeant Danny Nightingale with his wife Sally . Sarah says that weeks later she was visited at her marital home by an SAS officer. Soon after that, she had another meeting with a representative from a Services’ charity and two SAS officers who told her they were visiting her on behalf of the Commanding Officer. At this meeting Sarah says the SAS officers repeatedly denied another claim made by Soldier N – also detailed in the letter sent to the SAS Commanding Officer – that troops from the elite regiment would encourage each other with rewards to harass or harm individuals who were causing them difficulties. The soldiers would apparently write the person’s name, address and details on a slip of paper and place this in a box along with a cash payment. Another meeting between the SAS officer and Sarah took place in early 2012 when, she says, the officer handed over a brown envelope containing £500 and insisted that she should never discuss the payment with anyone, or discuss the Diana claim with anyone. Sarah said last night: ‘The strange thing was that at no time during this meeting  did the officers mention what my ex-husband had said about the SAS being involved in Princess Diana’s death.’ Indeed, the contents of the letter only became public knowledge last year following Sgt Nightingale’s second court martial for possessing the gun and ammunition, when Soldier N appeared as a prosecution witness for the Army against Sgt Nightingale. Sarah said: ‘The fact that they stayed silent about Diana compounded my belief that my ex-husband had told me the truth in  2008 when he talked about an SAS soldier directing a beam of light into the eyes of Princess Diana’s chauffeur as their Mercedes entered the Pont d’Alma road tunnel. My husband had added that after the . SAS had caused the car to crash, a soldier had run back to the wreckage . and looked inside to see how badly Princess Diana was hurt. ‘Apparently he then gave a signal to a colleague that their mission had been successful. So now I’m convinced that this operation is the SAS’s big secret.’ Front line: Soldier N pictured in the desert next to an SAS Land Rover during the Iraq War in 2003 . Yet another meeting with the  SAS took place in June last year, and it left Sarah terrified. She says that at that meeting the SAS officer suggested that she could ‘end up dead like the Woolwich soldier’ Lee Rigby if she spoke out against the regiment. At the time she was separated from Soldier N and was struggling to pay her household bills. The officer collected the payment notices and promised her that he would take care of them for her. But just as he was leaving Sarah’s house the conversation apparently took a dark turn and she was asked whether she was going to give evidence against the Army in its case against Sgt Nightingale, due to take place the following month. Sarah recalled: ‘The officer said . that if I spoke out in support of Danny, and against my former husband . who was the Army’s main prosecution witness, I might have cause to worry . about my safety and my children’s safety. ‘I . was already shocked but he then said that if I went public with . anything I knew I could “end up dead like the Woolwich soldier”. ‘He was staring at me the whole time he was saying this and he was very intimidating. Last moments: Princess Diana in her doomed car driving through Paris . Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed inside the lift at the Ritz Hotel . ‘I was really trembling as he left my house. Thankfully I had arranged for Theresa Lumby from the charity Women’s Aid to be present. She heard what the officer was saying to me and gave a statement to Danny Nightingale’s solicitor, Simon McKay.’ Ms Lumby declined to comment on the incident last night, but Mr McKay said: ‘Theresa Lumby overheard a conversation between the officer from the SAS and the former wife of Soldier N which touched on the fate of the Woolwich soldier Lee Rigby. ‘The impression of Theresa and the former wife was that this comment and others made by the officer about potential threats were intended to dissuade her from giving evidence on behalf of Sergeant Nightingale at his second court martial. ‘The incident was reported to the Service Prosecuting Authority as the defence was concerned it may amount to an attempt to intimidate a witness.’ Landmark: The SAS clock tower in Hereford the regiment's home town . Mr McKay added: ‘This is a matter of deep concern. The Metropolitan Police’s standards unit has now launched an investigation.’ Even . though two inquiries – by Scotland Yard and the French police – had . found Princess Diana’s death was an accident, the claim included in . Sarah’s mother’s letter led to the Metropolitan Police to reopen . Operation Paget, the official UK investigation into the fatal accident . in Paris on August 31, 1997. This led to yet another bizarre twist in the tale. As part of the new inquiry, on August 28 last year Sarah and her mother attended a police station in West Wales where they were interviewed by two senior detectives. At this meeting the officers handed her a copy of an email she had sent to her lawyer detailing her husband’s ‘erratic’ behaviour during their marriage. The 17-page document also briefly mentioned Soldier N’s claim that  the SAS had assassinated Princess Diana. Sarah said last night: ‘When I saw the statement I was shocked because I knew that I had not sent the email to anyone other than my divorce lawyer. 'Later I confirmed with her that she had not sent the email to any third party. So I am sure that the police intercepted this email.’ Scotland Yard’s Serious Misconduct Investigation Unit is now investigating how their officers came to have a copy of the email. A Scotland Yard spokesman said:  ‘We are aware of the complaint which is the subject of an ongoing investigation.’ And an Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘As the Metropolitan Police have said previously, when considering the allegations made in this letter they have found no evidential basis upon which to open any criminal investigation. ‘We take the welfare of our troops and their dependants extremely seriously and it is normal for service personnel and their families to be briefed on personal security measures, especially so at a time when they are likely to receive a high level of   media  attention.’","Incredible story of key witness that has a terrifying ring of truth .

"Novak Djokovic began his began his challenge for a hat-trick of ATP World Tour Finals triumphs in London with a 6-1 6-1 demolition of Croatia's Marin Cilic on Monday. The Serbian world number one produced a ruthless display against a ragged U.S. Open champion, opening his Group A account with a 56-minute masterclass. The 27-year-old has now won 28 consecutive matches indoors dating back to 2012 and should he win his remaining two group matches against Stanislas Wawrinka and Tomas Berdych he will be guaranteed to end the year on top of the rankings. Novak Djokovic raises his hands in victory after defeating Marin Cilic 6-1 6-1 at the ATP World Tour Finals . The world No 1 defeated reigning US Open champion Cilic in less than an hour for the loss of just two games . Djokovic is favourite to win the season ending finale featuring the world's top eight players . The Serbian star clenches his fist after racing to victory at London's O2 Arena . Cilic won the opening five points of the match but his debut at the ATP's prestige event quickly turned sour as Djokovic turned up the heat with a clinical display. Djokovic said: 'It was a great performance. I was hoping I could play this way. I was preparing myself for this match. I knew already one week ago that I was going to play Marin. 'Marin as a U.S. Open winner has a lot of confidence, but I managed to neutralise his serve and get a lot of ball back in play and that was part of the tactic.' 'You could see that he didn't feel so comfortable. I tried to use my experience playing on this stage, the stadium, which is pretty different from any other.' Cilic and Djokovic enter the court amid much fanfare ahead of their opening group game . Djokovic is renowned for his supreme fitness and finishing the end of the year strongly . Cilic, who is coached by former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanišević, had no answer to Djokovic's game . Djokovic's result mirrored group rival Stan Wawrinka's earlier thrashing of Thomas Berdych . Stanislas Wawrinka pummelled Tomas Berdych by the same 6-1 6-1 scoreline in 58 minutes before the evening's second match - making Monday's singles the most one-sided contests since the Tour Finals arrived in London in 2009, eclipsing Roger Federer's victory over Rafael Nadal in 2011 for the loss of three games. 'Unfortunately, it was my worst match of the whole season, and I kept it for the start here in the World Tour Finals,' said Berdych. In 2009 eight of the 12 round-robin matches went to three sets. None of the four singles matches so far have gone the distance and organisers and fans alike will be hoping for a rise in the excitement levels in the days to come.","Novak Djokovic defeated Marin Cilic 6-1 6-1 at ATP World Tour Finals .

"His turbulent love life and antics in Memphis might have dominated headlines in recent weeks but Prince Harry put high jinks to one side as he laid a wreath honouring Estonian soldiers in Tallinn's Freedom Square. The 29-year-old travelled to Talinn on a £143 easyJet flight - not the first time he has used the budget carrier, but still a highly unusual mode of transport for an official royal visit. Prince Harry's trip coincides with the return home of the last members of the Estonian contingent from Afghanistan, where they fought under British command and nine were killed.

International relations: These admiring glances say Prince Harry could teach the Foreign Office a thing or two . Prince Harry, himself a serving soldier, spent time with the Estonian troops during his two tours of Afghanistan, the most recent of which was in 2012. And it seems his appreciation of all things Estonian is fully reciprocated, after a cheering crowd of more than 300 people turned up to greet him as he arrived at Freedom Square. Mingling with well-wishers, the prince stopped and posed for a number of selfies and earned himself a big smile from one local lady, whose crown-shaped placard he signed. He couldn't resist a cheerful chat with the local ladies and swiftly set about winning hearts and minds as he arrived in Estonia to start a two-day tour. One little girl seemed a bit overcome and snuggled bashfully into her father's chest after presenting a delighted Prince Harry with her Union flag. After meeting the crowds, Prince Harry, who flew in on an EasyJet plane, paused to contemplate the cross-topped memorial dedicated to freedom fighters that dominates Tallinn's central square. Nice to meet you! The prince beamed as he greeted the crowd, many of whom were waving Union flags .

The prince, a serving Army officer, wore the all white tropical no 1 dress of the Household Cavalry and watched as two Estonian servicemen carefully placed his wreath at the base of the monument. Built from large glass blocks, it commemorates the 1918-1920 war of independence that saw the fledging country defeat Russian and German forces in its struggle for self-determination. The UK supported Estonia's fight for freedom and was one of the first to answer its call for help, providing naval support, armaments and other equipment - a move that defended the coastline and allowed the new country to build its own navy. The blooms on Harry's wreath featured some of Estonia's national colours, blue and white, and pinned to a ribbon attached to the floral tribute was a handwritten note that said: 'In memory of all those who gave their lives for their country - Harry'. Sombre: After greeting the crowds, Prince Harry paid his respects in a wreath-laying ceremony in Tallinn . Solemn: He was joined for the ceremony by senior members of the Estonian army which fought in Afghanistan . Salute: The prince saluted as he and the crowd observed a minute's silence in honour of Estonia's fallen . The prince bent down to adjust the wreath then took a few steps back and paused in a mark of respect as a bugler played the last post before saluting the monument during a minute's silence. After paying his respects, the prince was driven off to a military hospital where he met wounded Afghanistan victims - some of whom will compete in the Invictus Games in September - before addressing the Parliament of Estonia. Tomorrow, the prince is due to meet Estonia's president, Toomas Hendrik, and military leaders in Kevadtorm before observing NATO's Spring Storm military exercise. On Sunday, the 29-year-old will travel to Italy for the first time since visiting on a family holiday in 1985, where he will attend a number of events commemorating the Allied campaign during World War Two. His trip to Italy will include a visit to Monte Cassino, where he will attend the New Zealand service at the Cassino Commonwealth War Cemetery, and a trip to Rome. Prince Harry has travelled with easyJet in the past, but always for private holidays - such as his summer visit to Scotland in 2011. In August 2012 the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also used easyJet for a private visit to the Alps - even waiting in line with all the other passengers during security checks. It remains highly unusual, however, for a senior member of the Royal Family to use a budget carrier for an official visit. Ceremonial: Two Estonian soldiers carefully carried Prince Harry's wreath to the monument in Freedom Square . Heartfelt: The wreath bore a message from Prince Harry dedicated to the memory of soldiers who died fighting . Address: After the wreath-laying ceremony, Prince Harry addressed the Parliament of Estonia in Tallinn . Enjoying himself: Prince Harry smiles as he meets dignitaries after his speech at the Parliament of Estonia . Meeting: Estonian troops in Afghanistan are greeted by former PM Tony Blair during a visit to Camp Bastion .

"New Zealand's Aaron Cruden reveals all about his career so far. From quality coffee, Bora Bora and Denzel Washington to Muhammad Ali, the 2011 World Cup win and wanting to be a black cab driver... New Zealand's Aaron Cruden reveals all about his career so far before the Autumn internationals . Who is your sporting hero? Muhammad Ali. The way he was able to stay at the top of his sport and profession for so long, while facing so much adversity, is really impressive. Sonny Bill Williams and Liam Messam, two of my team-mates, have tried out boxing but it’s never crossed my mind to get in the ring. It would be pretty daunting! What would you be if you weren't a sportsman? When I left school I worked as a barista in a cafe. There aren’t too many cappuccino drinkers back home — I sharpened my skills on a latte or a flat white! I was always into PE at school and I enjoyed English as well. Career highlight? The 2011 World Cup win. I got the call-up late because of an injury but it was really special to win it in our home country. Like many, Muhammad Ali is Cruden's sporting hero, but he has never tried boxing . And the worst moment? Probably that World Cup final because it was a little bittersweet. I had to go off after about 30 minutes with an injury. I hyper-extended my knee and that was the end of my game. If your house was burning down, what one possession would you save? Is it a bit boring to say an All Blacks jersey? Maybe an All Blacks jersey and a spare pair of undies, because you never know when they could come in handy. What’s the best advice you've ever been given? It’s a bit of a cliche but you’ve always got to chase your dreams and follow your heart. If you’re eager to achieve something don’t let anyone tell you any different. That’s what my good old mum told me and it’s kept me in pretty good stead. Last film you saw? It was Man on Fire that stars Denzel Washington. It’s an old one but a goodie. I watched it on the flight to Chicago from New Zealand. Some of the taller boys struggle to sleep on planes but I find it quite luxurious with the space we get. Bora Bora in the French Polynesia is the New Zealand fly-half's favourite holiday destination . Favourite pre-match meal? I have some mashed spuds with baked beans, poached eggs, avocado and chicken. It generally stays the same and it’s usually cooked for us in the hotel. That’s what I would have on game day. Your favourite holiday destination? Bora Bora near Tahiti is an amazing place. It’s part of the French Polynesian islands and is about a seven-hour flight from New Zealand. It really is a beautiful part of the world, surrounded by a reef. In a film of your life, who would you like to play you? Denzel Washington would be pretty cool. He’s a bit of a dude and you never see him in a bad movie. I don’t see myself as a cool dude but he is, so I’ll pick him! He would want American actor Denzel Washington (left) to play him in a film about his life . Tell us a secret... If I tell you it’s not really a secret is it?! My mum doesn’t do my washing or anything like that. I was lying about what job I wanted to do when I was younger — I actually wanted to be a black-cab driver in London! If you are planning a trip to Bora Bora like Aaron, make sure you are covered with AIG travel insurance.

"A BBC radio star has beaten the Government in a tribunal after they wrongly claimed she was fit to work as she recovered from intensive chemotherapy and losing both breasts. Val Armstrong, of Carlisle, Cumbria, challenged the Department For Work and Pensions (DWP) after they unfairly cut her benefit. The 48-year-old was diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time in August 2010 and as a result underwent a double mastectomy. In pain from chemotherapy, the BBC Cumbria presenter was off work sick for two years and also suffered from insomnia. Unwell: Radio presenter Val Armstrong was recovering from chemotherapy . and cancer surgery when the Government unfairly cut her benefit. She is now healthy and back working at BBC Cumbria . With an active sick note, the DWP allowed her to claim contribution based employment support allowance but put her into a work related activity group for people who they feel are able to return to work. In March 2012 Val had to undergo a work capability assessment. During this medical she was awarded points according to her condition. Val needed to accumulate 15 points to continue to receive employment support however she was awarded 0 points. In April 2012 the DWP deemed her fit for work and were to stop her benefit unless she appealed. Val who has worked for the BBC for 31 years, said: 'My wage had stopped and my £96 a week was cut to £71 per week. I wasn't getting much to start with and of course this caused financial stress. 'I was lucky that I had put money aside and I had family who could help me financially but not everybody has family who can help them. 'At a time when I was battling to try to get back to full health, hurdles and obstacles were put in my way which made it very difficult.' In March 2012 Val had to undergo a work capability assessment. During this medical she was awarded points according to her condition. Val needed to accumulate 15 points to continue to receive employment support however she was awarded 0 points. In April 2012 the DWP then deemed her fit for work and were to stop her benefit unless she appealed. Response: The DWP say that all Britons are able to appeal decisions, which they say are based on medical evidence . Val teamed up with her Macmillan Cancer Support adviser to lodge one, as she knew she would struggle financially, especially as she cared for her mother. Six months later she received a phone call from civil servants saying she still did not have enough points for the full benefit. But after doing her homework Val soon found a regulation which stated that DWP hadn't followed their own rules. She then took the DWP to a tribunal on April 3, 2013 which she won, and will now receive a back payment, and has returned to work. She said: 'I am hoping that the people who genuinely feel that they have a case will find their voice and will take it all the way. 'I'm not fazed by the system and I know some people are but I totally believe that if people are being treated wrongly they they should take it all the way.' A DWP spokesperson said: 'A decision on whether someone is well enough to work is taken after consideration of all the supporting medical evidence provided by the claimant, but everybody has the right to appeal a decision if they disagree with it'.","Despite her breast cancer ordeal the DWP cut Val Armstrong's weekly cash .

"A 7-ft memorial cross that was stolen from its California desert perch two years ago mysteriously turned up hundreds of miles away in the San Francisco Bay area. A local sheriff's department was notified Monday that the large cross honoring war dead was tied to a fence post in Half Moon Bay, 400 miles northwest of where it was erected, with an attached note asking its finders to contact authorities. 'This cross is an important historical artifact,' the note read. Scroll Down for Video .

The National Park Service confirmed that it was the same Mojave Memorial Cross that went missing in 2010. The cross had been resting atop Sunrise Rock in a national preserve in the Mojave Desert since 1934. It was erected by the Veterans of Foreign Wars to honor those who served in World War I. At the time of its disappearance, the cross had been encased in a wooden box as a result of a decade-long legal battle over its existence between the VFW and the American Civil Liberties Union. The cross was cut from its metal base and . stolen after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it did not violate the . separation of church and state because the national preserve it stood on . was being transferred to a veterans group. Long trip: The cross honoring war dead was found tied to a fence post in the San Francisco Bay area, 400 miles northwest of the Mojave Desert where it was erected in 1934. State veterans believe the cross may have been returned by someone with a guilty conscious impacted by the upcoming celebration of Veteran’s Day, ABC reports. The VFW says it had been planning to dedicate a replacement for the stolen cross this Sunday. For now, the cross is in the custody of the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office. VFW leaders hope to receive custody of the cross and drive it to Southern California this weekend. ""We'll start reaching out, making some contacts, notifying our detective bureau will start making calls to Southern California and see if we can get this back to its rightful owner and get it back to its rightful spot,"" San Mateo County Sheriff's Sergeant John Gonzalez told ABC.

"The Irish Rugby Football Union has announced that there will be an all-Ireland bid to stage the 2023 Rugby World Cup. The Northern Ireland Executive and Irish Government are jointly supporting the effort to bring the sport's showpiece to Ireland's shores.

Mr Browne said at an event at the Royal School Armagh: 'The Irish Rugby Football Union believes that Ireland, and its people, will make the perfect hosts for the 2023 Rugby World Cup. 'We believe it is opportune for us now to put forward Ireland's undoubted credentials to host world rugby's showpiece.' The political administrations north and south have been engaged in a preliminary assessment exercise over the last 10 months to weigh up the feasibility of submitting an official bid. In February, former Irish international star Hugo MacNeill was asked to chair the cross-border working group examining the issue. As well as the traditional rugby stadiums such as the Aviva in Dublin, the Kingspan at Ravenhill in Belfast and Thomond Park in Limerick, a 2023 World Cup in Ireland would hope to utilise a number of impressive Gaelic football venues, including the 82,300-capacity Croke Park in Dublin. Mr Kenny said the Irish Government was fully behind the bid. 'I am delighted to formally announce the Government's support, in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Executive, to formally back the IRFU's bid to host the 2023 Rugby World Cup,' he said. 'Ireland will put together a winning bid that will be impossible to resist. We have the fans, the stadiums, and the accessibility to make it a World Cup to remember.'

'Rest assured, we will put together a robust and compelling bid to bring this sporting spectacle to Ireland,' he said. 'This bid shows Ireland has the appetite to host an international sporting event on a scale never seen before in our history and we are determined to make it a winning bid.' Next year's Rugby World Cup will be hosted by England, with Japan hosting the event in 2019. Argentina and Italy could be potential rivals for the 2023 bid. The winner will not be revealed until 2017.

"Real Sociedad say David Moyes is their new manager, despite the Scot insisting he is 'slightly surprised' with the club's announcement with some finer details of the 18-month deal yet to be completed. The 51-year-old Scot has thought long and hard about taking charge of a side struggling at the wrong end of Spain's La Liga, particularly when he knows the next job needs to be the right job after his brutal sacking at Manchester United in April. When Phil Neville rejected the opportunity to join Moyes in Spain over the weekend, he looked even less likely to take the job. Moyes is still giving thought as to who he may bring with him to Spain in his backroom staff. VIDEO Scroll down to see Tim Cahill's show of support for David Moyes . Former Manchester United manager David Moyes is the new Real Sociedad boss, according to the club . Moyes' reign at Old Trafford lasted just 10 months as the Scotsman failed to get the best out of his players . Saturday November 22 - Deportivo La Coruna (A) (17th in La Liga) Sunday November 30 - Elche (H) (18th in La Liga) Thursday December 4 - Real Oviedo (A) (3rd in Segunda B) Sunday December 7 - Villarreal (A) (8th in La Liga) Sunday December 14 - Athletic Bilbao (H) (11th in La Liga) Neville was a member of his coaching staff during that difficult 10-month tenure at Old Trafford but apparently has no desire to uproot his family and move abroad. But Moyes was given a tour of Real Sociedad's training ground and facilities on Friday and asked club president Jokin Aperribay for the weekend to think over the offer. It was not an easy choice with financial resources so limited despite the fact that only last season Sociedad were competing in the Champions League. The wage bill would not be comparable to most Premier League clubs and the cash available to bring in new players will demand much of Moyes in the transfer market. But with opportunities limited in the Premier League and Moyes keen to start rebuilding a reputation damaged by the United experience, the lure of working abroad and playing against Barcelona and Real Madrid is looking to be too much. Sociedad also put up this welcome banner to Moyes on their Twitter page on Monday evening . Moyes will stand in the dugout at the impressive Anoeta Stadium in San Sebastian where Sociedad play .

Ex-West Brom and Real Betis boss Pepe Mel was also in the running to replace Jagoba Arrasate, but Moyes was reportedly Sociedad's first choice and Real confirmed the Scot's appointment late on Monday night. Moyes' first game in charge is set to be the trip to promoted Deportivo La Coruna after the international break. Moyes becomes the fourth British manager of the San Sebastian-based outfit, following in the footsteps of Englishman Harry Lowe and Welsh duo John Toshack and Chris Coleman. Lowe was manager for five years from 1930 while Toshack has had three different stints in the hotseat, beginning in 1985 and then most recently in 2002. Current Wales boss Coleman, meanwhile, was appointed on a three-year contract in July 2007 after Sociedad were relegated to the Segunda Division for the first time in 40 years. Coleman resigned from his post in January 2008, citing a difference of ideas with new president Inaki Badiola, having led Sociedad up to fifth in the table and one point off the promotion places.

While in charge at Manchester United last season, Moyes twice faced Sociedad in the Champions League - winning at home and drawing away. Manchester United 1-0 Real Sociedad (October 24, 2013) An own goal from Ingo Martinez just two minutes into this Champions League tie at Old Trafford gave United a deserved victory - although they could and should have won by more.

Real Sociedad 0-0 Manchester United (November 6, 2013) The return fixture was not as happy for Moyes as United were frustrated in San Sebastian.

Welsh legend Toshack managed the club in three separate spells spanning three decades. He led Sociedad to the Copa del Rey in 1987, beating Atletico Madrid on penalties in the final. He returned to San Sebastian after his season at Real Madrid and then again during the 2001-2002 season. Chris Coleman, 2007-2008 .

"The Queen is to become the first monarch to attend Cabinet since Queen Victoria . The Queen is to attend a Cabinet meeting in Downing Street, it was announced today. Ministers have been told to be on best behaviour when the monarch takes a seat at the famous Cabinet table tomorrow morning. One minister today admitted the politicians will be 'minding their Ps and Qs'. She will become the first head of state to attend Cabinet since Queen Victoria. The visit is the latest stage in her Diamond Jubilee celebrations, which last week took in a trip to the Bank of England where she made headlines by criticising 'lax' financial regulators. She will have 'observer status' for half an hour at the weekly meeting of the senior members of the government, but any contribution she makes will be closely analysed. Since the coalition was formed the Cabinet room has occasionally been the scene of explosive rows, often between the Tories and Lib Dems. But both parties will want to present a united front for their special visitor. The Queen is expected to sit along . side Prime Minister David Cameron, meaning either Foreign Secretary . William Hague or Permanent Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood will have to . give up their seat. Downing Street said Cabinet ministers have had a whip round to buy the Queen a present to mark 60 years on the throne. Prince Philip will not join her on the visit. Downing Street announced the news on Twitter, with the message: 'The Queen will visit Downing St tomorrow. 'She will be presented with a gift to mark her Diamond Jubilee and attend Cabinet as an observer.' News of the Queen's visit to Cabinet was announced by Downing Street on Twitter . Musical chairs: Ministers will be told to budge up to make room for the Queen to sit alongside David Cameron at a Cabinet meeting . It is the second time the Queen will have been to Downing Street to mark her Jubilee year. In July she attended a lunch with Mr Cameron, and former Prime Ministers Sir John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: 'It is a great honour that she is attending Cabinet in her Diamond Jubilee year. It has been a very exciting year for everybody. Ministers will be excited but minding their Ps and Qs even more than normal.' Announcing the plan this morning, Downing Street said it was the first time since Queen Victoria that a reining monarch has attended Cabinet. The Prime Minister's official spokesman told a regular briefing of journalists: 'I think she will sit round the table and I think she will sit alongside the Prime Minister. 'It has been long planned as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. I think it will be well attended.' As head of state the Queen does not get involved in party politics, and merely signs off legislation brought forward by 'Her Majesty's Government'. However, last week she came close to expressing a personal view on government policy when she expressed dismay at the role of the regulators in the 2008 financial crash. Queen Elizabeth toured a gold vault during a visit to the Bank of England, where she appeared to criticise 'lax' financial regulators for the 2008 economic crash . In a highly controversial foray into government policy, the monarch appeared to criticise the regime created by the Labour government  when Gordon Brown was Chancellor. Touring the Bank of England, the Queen claimed some in the City had become 'lax' and were not focussed on the potential problems which triggered the credit crunch when banks were over-run by debt. Meeting staff at the Bank, she was head saying: 'People had got a bit...lax, had they?' She was told: 'A lot was going on under the surface that perhaps regulators weren't so focussed on.' But the Queen replied: 'The Financial Services - what do they call themselves, the regulators - Authority, which was really quite new...it didn't have any teeth.' In July the Queen was in Downing Street for a Diamond Jubilee lunch with four of her Prime Ministers, including (left to right) David Cameron, Sir John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown . Both the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority played down the significance of the remarks, which will be seen as a major rebuke from the head of state for failing to prevent the biggest economic crash since the Second World War. The Bank of England said it was 'very grateful to Her Majesty for her visit today and for taking such an interest in its work'. And the FSA admitted it made mistakes.","Queen to become first monarch to sit in on Cabinet deliberations since Queen Victoria .

"Russia and China have expressed growing concern about a possible American military strike against Iran over its nuclear programme. And this week the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is to . publish a damning report with 'compelling evidence' that Iran is secretly building an arsenal of nuclear warheads. Fresh details suggest that Iran could even be . 'nuclear ready' within months. And laying bare the disturbing extent of the country’s atomic weapons programme will increase calls in the United States for pre-emptive action against the Islamic state. And that plays into the hands of Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who is said to be pushing for an airstrike on Iran’s nuclear facilities. The Iranian nuclear power plant in Bushehr, southern Iran - a site that may be targeted in a mooted military strike . However, Iran has threatened to retaliate by blocking the Strait of Hormuz, severing 40 per cent of the world’s oil supplies. Russia's foreign minister today became the latest critic of any proposed action against Iran warning it would be 'a very serious mistake fraught with unpredictable consequences'. Sergei Lavrov added: 'The only path . for removing concerns is to create every possible condition' to resume . the talks between Iran and six world powers, which broke down last . December. China has also expressed concern about a military strike against Iran, but has also urged Tehran not to be confrontational with the IAEA. Moscow . and Beijing have signaled concern that the report will box Iran into a . corner and dim any chance of diplomacy resolving the dispute, which has . the potential to spark a wider conflict in the Middle East. Concerns: Russia's foreign minister Sergei . Lavrov, right, warned any action against Iran would be 'a very serious . mistake.' China's foreign minister Yang Jiechi, left, has also expressed . concern . 'The Russians in particular have been lobbying quite intensively,' one senior Western diplomat said. Meanwhile former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has weighed in to slam Iran saying the U.S. should consider . even tougher penalties against the Iranian government and 'be doing . everything we can to bring it down.' Rice told ABC's This Week that the U.S. should never take the option . of military force off the table when it comes to dealing with Iran. The current Iranian government is trying to obtain a nuclear . weapon and has repressed its own people, she said. 'The regime has . absolutely no legitimacy left,' she added. Israeli President Shimon Peres has also expressed a determination to launch a military strike against Iran. New UN evidence suggesting Iran was helped by several foreign scientists could provide further headache for Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . 'The . possibility of a military attack against Iran is now closer to being . applied than the application of a diplomatic option,' he said over the weekend. 'I . estimate that intelligence services of all these countries are looking . at the ticking clock, warning leaders that there was not much time . left,' he added. Republican candidate Rick Perry, last week came out to back an Israeli air strike on Iran. The Texas Governor said he would support Israel on the matter if there is proof Tehran is moving closer to having a nuclear weapon. The news comes as a former Soviet weapons expert and scientists in Pakistan and North Korea are all believed to have aided Iran in its nuclear quest, according to the United Nations. Former Soviet weapons scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko allegedly taught Iranians how to build high-precision detonators that could trigger a chain reaction, according to UN evidence. Danilenko was believed to have been contracted by Iran's Physics Research Centre, linked to the country's nuclear programme, in the mid 1990s. He allegedly gave lectures and shared research on developing and testing bombs that Iran then incorporated into their warhead design, according to Washington Post sources with access to IAEA's files. However, while Danilenko acknowledged his role he also said he believe his work was limited to assisting civilian engineering projects, the sources added. There is also no evidence that Russia knew of Danilenko's Iranian activities. Weapons experts added that Iran relied on foreign scientists for mathematical formulas and codes, some of which may have come from North Korea. The design for a neutron initiator by father of Pakistan's nuclear programme, Abdul Qadeer Khan, was also discovered in Iran, sources said. The latest intelligence provided to UN nuclear officials, due for publication on Wednesday and obtained by the Washington Post, suggests former Soviet weapons scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko allegedly taught Iranians how to build high-precision detonators that could trigger a chain reaction during the mid 1990s.' But it makes clear the Iranians want to be able to build such weapons quickly if need be. And thanks to outside help, the Iranians are now on 'the threshold' of making a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on top of a ballistic missile, says the study. One key technical breakthrough, say the IAEA’s intelligence sources, is that Iran has learnt how to design a device known as an R265 generator. It added there was also evidence to suggest other . precision technology linked to experts in Pakistan and North Korea had . helped advance Iran's nuclear capabilities. Iranian officials appear unconcerned. Iran’s foreign minister and former nuclear official, Ali Akbar Salehi, told the Mehr News Agency: 'Let . them publish and see what happens,' adding that the uproar over the . country's nuclear programme was '100 per cent political' and that the . IAEA is 'under pressure from foreign powers.' Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Sunday the U.S. feared Iran's growing military power because it is now able to compete with Israel and the West. 'Yes, . we have military capabilities that are different from any other country . in the region,' he said. 'Iran is increasing in capability and . advancement and therefore we are able to compete with Israel and the . West and especially the United States.' 'The U.S. fears Iran's capability. Iran will not permit (anyone from making) a move against it.' Proof: A test-fire launch of a short-range missile in Iran. The UN now has a 'compelling case' that Iran is building an arsenal of nuclear weapons . Iran is conducting its secret nuclear programme at the Parchin military base, near Tehran, according to sources close to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Iran has allegedly carried out experiments in the final, critical stage for developing nuclear weapons, including explosions real and simulated. These have been carried out in a bus-sized container spotted on satellite photos, according to reports. U.S. intelligence agencies are thought to have believed the base is suitable for developing nuclear weapons for around eight years. The Iranians have rejected an IAEA request to visit Parchin in the past, arguing the IAEA rules allowed it to deny such visits to military bases. Now the site is under scrutiny again as a suspected location for covert nuclear activity. One . part of the IAEA's report is thought to reinforce concerns that Iran . continued its nuclear programme after 2003 - the year that U.S. intelligence agencies believed it had bowed to international pressures . to halt experiments. One . Iranian document suggests scientists had been discussing plans to start a . four-year study of neutron initiators beginning in 2007 - four years . after the 2003 deadline, according to sources. 'The programme never really stopped,' David Albright, a former UN weapons inspector who has seen the intelligence files said according to the Washington Post. 'After 2003, money was made available for research in areas that sure . look like nuclear weapons work but were hidden within civilian . institutions,' he added. Tehran denies secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons, insisting it is enriching uranium for reactors to generate electricity. But Iran has become increasingly belligerent in recent weeks and tensions are continuing to mount over its ambitions. The country's history of concealing sensitive nuclear activity and its refusal to suspend work that can potentially yield atomic bombs have already been punished by four rounds of U.N. sanctions, and separate U.S. and European punitive steps. Earlier this week, it was revealed Britain was drawing up contingency plans for any military action. Commanders . were working out how to deploy Navy submarines equipped with Tomahawk . cruise missiles in case President Barack Obama decides to launch missile . strikes against Iranian bases. Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and defence minister Ehud Barak are reportedly agitating for pre-emptive action. Mr Netanyahu is seeking Cabinet support for an attack and earlier this week Israel test-fired a new long-range missile.","Fears mount that Iran could be 'nuclear ready' in a matter of months .

"A group of gang members involved in a botched 'crash for cash' insurance scam which led to the death of an innocent motorist have been found guilty. The deliberately-caused accident, . arranged as part of a plan to commit insurance fraud, led to a . collision in which 34-year-old Baljinder Kaur Gill was killed. Prosecutors said that the Miss Gill's death was the first fatality from a 'crash for cash' scheme in Britain. Fraudsters: Jacek Kowalczyk, left, and Andrzej Skowron, right, were both convicted of conspiracy commit fraud and death by dangerous driving at Reading Crown Court. Their staged crash inadvertently led to the death of 34-year-old Baljinder Kaur Gill . Miss . Gill was left stranded in the fast lane of a dual carriageway after she was . caught up in the planned collision. Her Ford Fiesta was then . inadvertently struck by a white van, which was not part of the scam, as she  went to retrieve possessions from inside her vehicle. Fraudsters Radoslaw Bielawski, Andrzej Skowron and Jacek Kowalczyk had hoped to con insurance . companies by making bogus claims for personal injury and damage to their . vehicles as a result the initial crash. Silence: Radoslaw Bielawski, 24, refused to testify at the trial but after the crash he admitted to police that the collision had been staged. He was found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud and death by dangerous driving . But their plan tragically backfired and a jury found the trio guilty of causing . Miss Gill’s death by dangerous driving and conspiracy to commit fraud. Van driver Colin Lee, 34, was cleared of causing death by dangerous driving but convicted . of the lesser charge of death by careless driving. An Audi A3 driven by 25-year-old . Skowron swerved in front of a Volkswagen Passat containing 'co-conspirators', Reading Crown Court heard. Miss Gill’s Ford Fiesta was damaged in the incident and stranded in the fast lane of the A40 Western Avenue, between the Swakeley roundabout and . Denham, heading out of London. Skowron claimed he had been drinking in London at the time and that if his mobile phone had been . traced to the crash scene it would have been in his jacket, which had been taken by someone else. Jacek Kowalczyk, 32, admitted that the Audi had swerved in front of the VW but that the group had not . realised it was the car belonging to co-accused Radoslaw Bielawski. Bielawski, 24, who was in the Volkswagen, refused to testify at the . trial. He gave officers at the scene a false name but later admitted to police that the collision had been staged. Another fraudster, Artur Okrutny, 23, was at a party his home in Norbury, London, . when he said he received phone calls from Bielawski offering him £300 to tell police it was him who had been in the car. Bielawski allegedly told Okrutny . to say he was drunk and had been asleep in the back of the car at the . time of the crash and Okrutny went along with it. The latter said he agreed to the . lie on the basis that it would be in a police statement but maintained . that he knew nothing about a false insurance claim. Lie: Artur Okrunty, 23, was not involved in the crash but pretended he was drunk and had been asleep in the back of the car at the time of the crash . Kowalczyk was convicted of conspiracy to commit fraud, death by dangerous driving and perverting the course of justice. Bielawski and Skowron were found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud and death by dangerous driving, while OKrutny was convicted of perverting he course of justice. Baljit Ubhey, of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said that the location chosen for the scam posed an 'obvious risk'. Guilty: Colin Lee, who was not part of the gang, was driving the van that hit Miss Gill's vehicle. He was found guilty of death by careless driving . He warned that 'crash for cash' incidents currently cost the motor industry £1.7 million every day. He said the gang would have only earned between £12 - 15,000 in compensation between them for the crash, plus damage costs for the vehicles. Mr Ubhey said: 'Miss Gill . lost her life on 11 June 2011, as a consequence of a 'crash for cash' insurance scam; a . collision contrived by a ruthless gang of men, so that they could profit . financially from the submission of fraudulent insurance claims. 'Her death was Britain's first fatality as a result of 'crash for cash'. 'An earlier report from the Insurance . Fraud Bureau warned it was merely a matter of time before a death . occurred on British roads - sadly prophetic words.' Sgt Jim Upton, from the Three Mile . Cross roads policing department, described Miss Gill's death as as a 'despicable act', adding that the gang's actions . 'were always likely to lead to death or serious injury'. Sgt Upton added: 'They were purely motivated by greed and a determination to abuse the compensation culture that is prevalent in crash for cash. 'This is believed to be the first case . of its kind within the United Kingdom and it has been a long, complex . and protracted investigation. However, we were clear at an early stage . that this was a very unusual fatal collision and we were determined to . bring all those responsible to justice.' The men have been bailed until February to be sentenced at Reading Crown Court.","Baljinder Kaur Gill, 34, was killed when a van crashed into her vehicle .

"Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, Prince George's new nanny, was tipped to become a nun had she not followed her passion of caring for children . Prince George’s new Spanish nanny would have become a nun if she had not ended up pursuing her passion for looking after children, friends claimed yesterday. Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo’s austere lifestyle made her the perfect candidate to become a servant of God, they said. Single Miss Borrallo, 43, a graduate of the prestigious nanny school Norland College, is said to have been nicknamed Santa – Spanish for saint – by those closest to her when she was a youngster. Locals in her home city of Palencia in northern Spain said they would not have been surprised if Maria Teresa had ended up choosing a church job like her brother Luis,  ordained a deacon in 2011. One said: ‘We all thought she would end up becoming a nun because she was such a different girl to the rest. She hardly had any friends and she didn’t show any interest in boys.’ Family hairdresser Antonio Robledo told Spanish daily El Mundo: ‘She is very special and shy and I’ve never known her to have had a boyfriend. Above all, she’s a good person.’ The new Royal nanny, whose engineer father Luis died of cancer, was born in Madrid  but moved to Palencia as a child. She is the second eldest of four children. She attended church regularly with the rest of her family as she was growing up. A neighbour at the spacious city centre apartment where her mother Maria Teresa still lives gave her private lessons in chemistry, physics and maths, which she is said to have struggled with at school. She left Spain for the UK more than 20 years ago after graduating with a degree in teaching but returns to Palencia to see her family whenever she gets a chance. One of her brothers, Ignacio, teaches private students in the area viola and violin. He boasts on an online CV he is one of the most sought-out violin and viola teachers in Spain’s Castile and Leon region, with more than 20 years of experience at conservatories and music schools in his home country and Canada. Miss Borrallo is a graduate of famous Norland College, where fees for undergraduates cost nearly £13,000 per year and students are required to wear a uniform including the signature hat . Graduates of the school are sought after by celebrities, so much so they teach nannies how to shield children from paparazzi, especially while driving . Her youngest brother Pablo, a teacher, is living and working in the south of France. Maria Teresa’s parents’ 1967 wedding at a prestigious Roman Catholic school in Madrid received a mention in the society pages of Spain’s royalist Right-wing daily newspaper ABC. Her retired housewife mum reportedly uses her free time to teach handicapped children from her home in Palencia. Speaking on Friday before leaving for a weekend away, she said: ‘I am very proud of my daughter, that’s all I can say. On the personal front, and professionally, my daughter couldn’t be better.’ Her brother Luis revealed his sister had a soft spot for classic Spanish food including paella and the cold soup gazpacho. He added: ‘I’m very happy for her because she’s worked hard to get where she has. ‘Children are her life and her great passion.’","Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, 43, is Prince George's new nanny .
