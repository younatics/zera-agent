"(CNN) -- Tour de France race director Christian Prudhomme has confirmed the 2013 race -- the centenary edition -- will start on the French island of Corsica. Corsica, which lies off the southern French coast, will host the first three stages of the race from Porto-Vecchio to Calvi, the first time the Tour has ever visited. Prudhomme told AFP: ""For the hundredth edition of the race, we wanted to go somewhere new, somewhere spectacular. ""In Corsica, we have all of that. We have everything in place for an enchanting start to the race,"" he added. The opening 201.5km stage from Porto-Vecchio to Bastia is likely to favor the sprinters, while the 153km second stage from Bastia to Ajaccio, is expected to see the climbers come to the fore. The third stage is relatively short, just 145km from Ajaccio to Calvi. Every French region has hosted a stage of the Tour but the race has never previously crossed over to Corsica, the birthplace of Napoleon Bonaparte, for logistical reasons. The 2012 Tour de France will begin in the Belgian city of Liege on June 30.","The 2013 Tour de France will start from the French island of Corsica .

"(CNN) -- Formula One outfit Force India will auction a specially customized car next week in order to raise money for charity and the team's driver academy. The ""art car"" was driven by Italian Giancarlo Fisichella for 16 races during the 2008 season and has been decorated by motorsport artist Dexter Brown. The vehicle has also been signed by a host of F1 stars, from current drivers including McLaren's 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton and Ferrari's two-time title winner Fernando Alonso, to legendary past champions such as Briton Jackie Stewart. Proceeds from the sale, which are expected to be in excess of $239,000, will be split between the Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital in London and the UK-based team's own initiative aimed at finding and developing driving talent in India. Aircraft canopies the future of motorsport safety? ""When I was approached to paint an art car, I was immediately excited by the project as it's the first time I've had the chance to work with a modern Formula One car,"" said Brown, who has been involved in motorsport art for three decades. ""Painting the car was an interesting challenge because I had to work around the complex bodywork. It's great to be involved in such a unique project and I look forward to seeing how much it can raise for these two great causes."" Force India's finances have recently been boosted by a $100 million injection from new part-owners Sahara, after team principal Vijay Mallya sold 42.5% of his stake. ""Seeing one of my Formula One cars transformed into a painting is a wonderful initiative that combines two of my greatest passions: cars and art,"" billionaire Mallya said. The car, which has been stripped of its F1 engine, will be sold in Battersea, London on Wednesday.","F1 team Force India will auction a customized car for charity .

"(CNN) -- Israeli warplanes took to the air overnight Thursday, striking back after rockets were fired into territory from Gaza, Israeli and Palestinian officials said. Hamas security sources said that two Palestinian rockets were fired into Israel on Thursday night. The Israel Defense Forces said in a news release that one such rocket caused damage to an abandoned building. In response, an Israeli military aircraft targeted what the IDF described as a ""terror activity site"" in the central Gaza Strip overnight. ""A direct hit was confirmed,"" the statement added. Around 1 a.m. Friday, an Israeli missile hit a Hamas military base located east of the al-Maghazi refugee camp, said Hamas security sources. They added that Israeli warplanes remained in the skies at least 40 minutes later. There were no related injuries, local medical sources said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Nearly seven decades after the attack on Pearl Harbor, thousands of Japanese-American World War II veterans were honored Wednesday at a Congressional Gold Medal ceremony held at the U.S Capitol. In a rare moment of unity, Democratic and Republican Senators and members of the House of Representatives praised Japanese-American soldiers of the 442nd Regiment Combat Team and the 100th Infantry Battalion and veterans of the Military Intelligence Service for their contribution to the war. ""Aloha and welcome,"" said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, at the start of the invitation-only event inside the Capitol's Emancipation Hall. About 1,000 people witnessed the ceremony in person, including several aging Japanese-American honorees and their families who waited years for this day. When World War II began, Japanese-Americans were not invited to serve. Two years into the war, the U.S. military created an all-volunteer Japanese-American combat team who soon adopted the slogan ""Go for Broke."" Most of its roughly 20,000 members were born in the United States to Japanese-born parents. They went on to become one of the most decorated American units in the war, yet when they returned home, many faced discrimination. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said Wednesday's ""long-overdue honor"" is now ""bestowed on American heroes."" ""You fought not only the enemy, you fought prejudice, and you won,"" Pelosi said. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, said the ceremony ""demonstrates the greatest of America, a nation that recognized that it made mistakes, corrected them and moved on to become a stronger country and we are proud to defend the freedoms and ideals that this country represents."" Read a profile of one of the veterans, Susumu Ito . President Barack Obama signed legislation last year approving the creation of a Congressional Gold Medal for Japanese-American veterans. The medal states in part, ""The United States remains forever indebted to the bravery, valor, and dedication to country that these men faced while fighting a two-front battle of discrimination at home and fascism abroad. Their commitment demonstrates a highly uncommon and commendable sense of patriotism and honor."" One recipient, Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, received a standing ovation when he rose to speak at the event. He said the road to recognizing Japanese-American World War II veterans ""has been a long journey, but a glorious one. I'm certain those who are resting in cemeteries are pleased with this day."" Inouye, who lost his right arm while leading his men of the 2nd Battalion, 442nd Combat Team in an attack against German machine gun nests in Italy, received the Medal of Honor 55 years later, in 1999. George Otsuki, now almost 92, who was a sergeant serving in the 442nd, called the recognition ""wonderful."" ""The public found out what we did,"" he told CNN, ""and that's the main thing."" Frank Mizufuka, who was born in Los Angeles and served as a sergeant in the same unit, said ""it was a once-in-a-lifetime, extraordinary event."" Mizufuka, 89, said he spent a year in a hospital recovering from a chest wound he received in combat. ""I didn't believe I'd live to see this day,"" he said.","More than 20,000 Japanese-Americans served in World War II .

"New York (CNN) -- A woman who died in a helicopter crash in New York's East River was identified by authorities as Sonia Marra of Sydney, Australia and died on her 40 birtthday, authorities said Wednesday. Marra was the only passenger who died after Tuesday's crash in the river near midtown Manhattan, New York police said. Marra, who is also a British citizen, was traveling with a friend her mother, stepfather when the chopper went down, CNN affiliate WABC reported. The other were injured but Marra got trapped in the backseat of the Bell 206 chopper and was the sole passenger unable to escape the craft as it inverted and sank, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. As the chopper approached for a helipad landing, the pilot radioed that he was having problems, just moments before the craft crashed into the river, the mayor said. Images broadcast on CNN affiliate WCBS soon after the crash showed at least three people being towed to shore in a rescue effort. U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat who represents Manhattan's East Side in Congress, said in a statement she was ""saddened and deeply concerned"" about the crash. ""There have been at least 28 helicopter crashes in our city over the last three decades,"" Maloney said. ""Federal transportation officials should investigate not only the causes of this crash, but also whether it is safe to have such a high volume of helicopter traffic over our densely populated city."" Had the crash occurred over land, the death toll could have been much higher, she said. CNN's Jason Kessler, Eden Pontz and Rob Frehse contributed to this report.","The victim was traveling with family members .

"Washington (CNN) -- As the now-former presidential hopeful Herman Cain moves to Plan B, black conservatives say it's time to stick with their Plan A, and use the leverage that the GOP candidate gave them. ""The movement should ...work actively, consistently, and thoroughly to bring the conservative message to new audiences with a firm grasp of the issues,"" conservative commentator Lenny McAllister said. But Cain's rise in the polls -- strong enough to have been taken seriously as a legitimate candidate â€” seems as unlikely as the rise of a young, black conservative Republican movement. Both seem an anomaly, especially among the African-American community. ""It can be rough out there being a black conservative, particularly in Washington D.C. and New York City,"" said Crystal Wright, who runs the blog ConservativeBlackChick.com. ""We're angry, we're frustrated and we want to do something about it."" Wright said the Republican Party is fast becoming an alternative for African-Americans disproportionately affected by the failing economy. ""What we believe is to vote Barack Obama out of office,"" she said. Black conservatives say high profile GOP candidates like Cain and Michael Steele, who once headed the Republican National Committee, have helped their visibility and recruitment efforts. ""More people have come out of the closet as black republicans,"" McAllister said. But all agree, there is no collective voice among black conservatives, and Cain certainly didn't enjoy all of their support. ""... Even prior to the allegations, all of the opportunities where he misspoke and contradicted himself on different things,"" McAllister said of Cain's announcement to suspend his campaign today. ""A stronger campaign would have done a lot more for black conservatism. So there are definitely some out there who feel a little betrayed and feel a sense of disappointment, and a lost opportunity as well,"" he adds. Earlier this week, another tea party darling -- and one of two black Congressmen -- Rep. Allen West (R-Fla.) called for Cain to step down, saying on WMAL's morning radio show,""... he probably needs to understand that he's a distracter for what's going on right now and we should move on."" But Cain's legacy isn't lost on those who say they were happy to see a face like theirs in the race and with a message closely aligned with what they believe. ""There were probably many black conservatives who weren't sure if the tea party movement were accepting of them, but Cain proved that they were,"" says Richard Ivory, Publisher of the HipHopRepublican.com, which caters to urban republican and libertarian voters of color. Ivory, whose site has had nearly a million views since its launch in 2004, says, ""I think the best thing that Cain has done for the black [conservative movement] ... and this is one thing that no one can take away from him -- is that Cain has shown that a black conservative in the future can actually rise through the Republican primary to become president of the United States, if he's very strategic."" Even though Cain's strategy failed to keep him in the race for the Republican nomination, it succeeded in adding his voice to the political dialogue within the diverse landscape of conservative African-American voters. ""Just because my parents vote Democrat party, why am I really voting for them?"" said Wright, whose mission is to encourage more black voters to examine candidates rather than vote emotionally. She thinks the GOP's policy stances on education, family values and tax rates for entrepreneurs will attract many among the young and college educated. ""The pulse of black conservatism rests primarily with its younger generation,"" said Ivory, adding that they have been ""watching curiously, via blogs, Facebook and Twitter, but who for the most part aren't huge fans of any of the current candidates."" So what gains can those pushing the conservative black movement make going forward? ""I think black Republicans understand that you have to be within the system to make changes to the system, where there needs to be changes made to the system,"" McAllister said. But, for now Cain says, ""We will change it from the outside.""","Some young black conservatives view Cain's downfall with mixed feelings .
His many mistakes, they say, hurt their cause .
But his early success and tea party support show the movement could embrace a black conservative ."
"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Pop star Britney Spears is an ""adult child in the throes of a mental health crisis"" whose ""life is presently at risk,"" her parents said Wednesday night after the singer was released from a hospital. Jamie and Lynne Spears said in a statement that they were dismayed to learn that their daughter had been discharged from the University of California-Los Angeles Medical Center Wednesday over the recommendation of her psychiatrist. They said the hospital could ""best care for her and keep her safe."" ""We are deeply concerned about her safety and vulnerability and we believe her life is presently at risk,"" the statement added. ""There are conservatorship orders in place created to protect our daughter that are being blatantly disregarded. We ask only that the court's orders be enforced so that a tragedy may be averted."" Spears left the Los Angeles hospital Wednesday afternoon, nearly a week after being admitted in the latest stage of an extraordinary public meltdown.  Get a paparazzi-eye view of Spears » . Followed by paparazzi, a convoy of police escorted Spears to University of California-Los Angeles Medical Center on January 30, her second hospitalization in a month. It was the latest step in the personal and career skid for the 26-year-old singer, now embroiled in a battle with ex-husband Kevin Federline over the custody of their two sons. Spears left the facility Wednesday in her black Mercedes-Benz and drove to a hotel with television helicopters tracking every turn. A crowd of photographers swarmed around her when she arrived. She also had been taken to another hospital January 3 for drug and alcohol tests and a psychiatric evaluation after a custody dispute at her home. The following day, a California court refused to grant Spears visitation rights with her children -- Sean Preston, 2, and Jayden James, 1 -- until mid-February at the earliest. In the last year, the onetime Mouseketeer has shaved her head as photographers looked on; been cited for ""habitual, frequent, and continuous use of controlled substances and alcohol"" by the judge in her custody case; and seen her ""comeback"" performance on the MTV Video Music Awards panned by critics who derided her singing, dancing, costume choice and weight. Spears' parents obtained a restraining order against her manager earlier this week, accusing Omar ""Sam"" Lufti -- whom Spears met in October -- of drugging her and controlling her life, her finances and her exposure to photographers. The order barred Lufti from Spears' homes and those of her family, as well as her children. Federline, Spears' former backup dancer, holds primary custody of the children. Spears had been in trouble with the court earlier concerning her compliance with court orders in the custody case.

"(CNN) -- A court ruled Wednesday that WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange will be extradited to Sweden to face questioning over accusations of sex crimes made by two women, despite his legal battle to stay in Britain. Some key players in the WikiLeaks saga are split on how they feel about Assange, but they all agree the website's future could be dire. Assange said in October that he was temporarily suspending WikiLeaks publishing due to lack of funds, and it's unclear whether the possibility of Assange going to jail will mean the death knell for its operations. (The case is unrelated to WikiLeaks.) ""Do I get personal satisfaction from Julian's extradition? Well, I think Julian took Bradley for everything he was worth and hung him out to dry,"" Adrian Lamo said Wednesday. Lamo is the California ex-hacker who claimed in the summer of 2010 that U.S. soldier Bradley Manning confessed to him in online chats that Manning had leaked classified wartime documents to WikiLeaks. Lamo told his story to CNN.com shortly after a trove of secret Afghanistan war documents were published online on WikiLeaks and in three other mainstream media publications. Manning remains behind bars in Kansas; he has been held for more than a year and a half. ""(Assange's) ego was so strong he thought he could bend light and get people to do whatever he wanted. He cannot,"" Lamo said regarding Assange's loss Wednesday in court. Assange has refused to comment about whether Manning was WikiLeaks' source for its Iraq or Afghanistan war logs or other diplomatic cables it has published in the past year. Manning has not commented about his alleged involvement in WikiLeaks. ""I hope WikiLeaks is more than just one man, and that despite the extradition and the enormous pressure, WikiLeaks will continue,"" said Jeff Paterson, who is involved with the Bradley Manning Support Network, which raises money for Manning's defense. Paterson founded the group Courage to Resist, which according to a document on its website, has raised nearly $400,000. The majority of that money pays for Manning's private legal counsel, Paterson said, and the rest pays for numerous protests the group has staged in support of the soldier. WikiLeaks contributed $15,100 in January. ""I hope Julian Assange gets a fair hearing (in Sweden),"" Paterson said. ""No matter what happens I feel confident people will continue to stay focused on Manning's case."" The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a First Amendment advocacy group, said the extradition order could send a chill through journalism. ""The real danger to Internet and press freedom is if Sweden now decides to extradite Assange to the U.S. for charges unrelated to what he's facing in Sweden,"" said spokesperson Trevor Timm. Daniel Ellsberg has been a prominent defender of Manning. The 80-year-old who famously leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1971 purposely got arrested in front of the White House in March while trying to call attention to what he said was Manning's unjust treatment. ""This is not the end of the story here,"" said Ellsberg, noting that another hearing later this month will be held if Assange can appeal the extradition order. He doesn't think Wednesday's news about Assange will deflate support for WikiLeaks, Assange, Manning or the effort to leak documents online in any forum. ""I certainly feel that Assange has done, on balance, a very great service to our country and the world with these disclosures he has published,"" Ellsberg said. ""That doesn't mean that I agree with every decision that he has made, or that he's made no mistakes."" Ellsberg called Assange a ""hero"" of his. ""I would like to see him continue to operate,"" he said.","Court rules that Julian Assange be extradited to Sweden .

"(CNN Student News) -- December 17, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Washington, D.C. • Afghanistan • Pakistan . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hi, I'm Carl Azuz, and this is CNN Student News, where Fridays are awesome! This one, though, is a little sad, because it's actually our last show of 2010. Before we move ahead into 2011, we're going to look back at some of the biggest stories from this year. And we kick things off with today's headlines. First Up: Capitol Hill . AZUZ: First up, a quick check of where things stand with some high-profile proposals in Congress. The tax cut deal: Thursday afternoon, that was with the House of Representatives. Some Democrats were indicating that it would probably pass, despite being controversial. If that happens, everyone's taxes will stay at this current rate, where they are right now, for the next two years. The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START, a new nuclear treaty between the U.S. and Russia. Treaties like this have to be approved by the U.S. Senate, and that group was getting ready to begin debating this proposal yesterday. Finally, Don't Ask Don't Tell, the policy that bans homosexuals from serving openly in the U.S. military. The House voted to overturn that ban on Wednesday. Now, Don't Ask Don't Tell heads to the Senate. Congress is scheduled to go on break starting tomorrow. You can get the latest details on all of these proposals at CNN.com. Strategy Review . AZUZ: Over at the White House, there's a new report about how the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan is going. This comes out once a year, and this year's report seems to be fairly positive. And President Obama says the U.S. is making a lot of progress in the nine-year war in Afghanistan, although recent polls suggest that a growing number of Americans do not support the war. The president says the goals that have been set for that conflict are on track. That includes the plan to start pulling troops out of Afghanistan in 2011. But the president acknowledged that the war is difficult. While U.S. and Afghan forces are making progress, he said those gains are fragile. The strategy report discussed the importance of a long-term commitment to helping that region of the world. Tribal Conference . AZUZ: The president wants to improve the relationship between the federal government and Native American communities. He met with the leaders of 565 tribes at the White House conference yesterday to try and work on that. President Obama said he wants to get more input from the tribes about ways the U.S. government might be able to help them. That could include supporting education and health care on Native American reservations, for example, or making changes to the criminal justice system there. He says there's been some progress, but there needs to be more. Wicked Weather . AZUZ: A lot of people looking to take a flight Wednesday were delayed by these winter storms that have been pounding parts of the United States. It's not even officially winter yet. You wouldn't know that by stepping outside, though. The National Weather Service put out winter storm warnings and advisories for more than a dozen states. Sandra Endo examines the impact of the cold. (BEGIN VIDEO) SANDRA ENDO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This frozen water fountain in Raleigh, North Carolina is proof of just how cold it is in the South. Wicked winter weather sweeping across the deep South to the upper Plains, causing plenty of problems, especially on the roads. In Georgia, it took trucks, salt and sand to get this school bus carrying high school kids to budge after slick ice left it at a standstill for hours. Some Georgia drivers couldn't keep their cars from moving after authorities say roads went from normal to an ice rink in just minutes. Some drivers were sent slipping and sliding. Pile-ups in Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi have caused several deaths. Earlier this week, some states began bracing for the worst. In Tennessee, officials sprayed the road with beet juice and salt, their solution to combat the winter white stuff. But planes can't compete with the wintry mix. Air travel is being disrupted by mother nature's chill. Several airlines are reporting cancellations and major delays. In Washington, I'm Sandra Endo. (END VIDEO) Shoutout .

We asked you to vote on your favorite type of Before We Go segment. The winning category: stunts! We're not saying no animals were involved.

"(CNN) -- Police on Tuesday scoured the area in Detroit where Bianca Jones was last reported seen, searching for any signs of the missing 2-year-old girl. Bianca was reportedly traveling with her father in a 2004 silver Mercury Grand Marquis on Friday when they were carjacked, said Sgt. Eren Stephens, a spokeswoman with Detroit police. ""The suspect took off in the car with her in it,"" she said, citing what the father told authorities. The vehicle was subsequently recovered, but the girl remains missing. However, Detroit Police Chief Ralph Godbee Jr. said in a statement over the weekend that the ""authenticity and credibility of the original version of events is under intense scrutiny by our investigative team,"" seeming to suggest that police do not believe what the father told them happened. ""At this time, we're looking at everything,"" Stephens said. Bianca is described as African-American, 2 feet, 5 inches tall, 25 pounds, with brown hair and brown eyes. She was last seen wearing a pink dress, pink tights, pink shoes and a purple coat, according to an Amber Alert issued last week by the Michigan State Police. Her father, D'Andre Lane, spoke to HLN's Nancy Grace on Tuesday night, begging whoever took his daughter to bring her back. ""I don't care about anything else that's going on right now but my daughter's safe return home to her family,"" he said. ""I just want my daughter back home."" Lane appeared alongside his attorney, Terry L. Johnson, who said his client gave police permission to enter his home and has fully cooperated in the investigation. Stephens declined to say whether police have searched Lane's house. ""My daughter is a beautiful little girl. She has a bright personality. She's the type of person that lights up a room when she walks in it. She's very intelligent,"" Lane told HLN's Grace. ""She's just a wonderful little girl to be around."" About 150 volunteers turned out on Monday to help look for Bianca, said Stephens, who also declined to comment on whether they or police had found anything useful. She urged anyone with information on the possible whereabouts of the little girl to contact Detroit police.","NEW: The father of the missing girl describes his daughter as beautiful, bright and intelligent .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- A black Republican who has rankled liberals and suddenly risen in prominence is torpedoed with old allegations of sexual harassment as he challenges the conventional wisdom about how African-Americans think and pursues an important position atop the federal government. Haven't we seen this movie? Get ready for the sequel. Politico reported recently that two women -- whose names are being withheld by the website -- accused Herman Cain of sexual harassment in the 1990s while the businessman led the National Restaurant Association, and that a financial settlement ""in the five-figure range"" was reached to keep the story quiet. When confronted with the allegation, the GOP front-runner showed that he is new to politics by mangling his responses in one media interview after another. At first, Cain went with the tried and tested approach: ""No comment."" Then he claimed to know nothing about the case. Then he claimed that he did know a little about the case, but that he didn't know there had been a settlement. Then he tried to tell us that there was a difference between a ""settlement"" and an ""agreement."" And, by the end of the day, he was admitting that there had been a settlement and that, in the case of one woman, it had amounted to about three months salary. It was both amusing and painful to watch. I'm not sure whether to applaud Cain for not knowing how to lie with the panache of other Republican presidential hopefuls, or tell him to run for the exit. I hope he doesn't quit the race, as some Beltway commentators are suggesting he should do -- not because this scandal is so bad that he can't recover, but because the elite media can't wait to clear the field and get to what they think will be the main event: Mitt Romney versus Barack Obama. There is no question that Cain's handling of this story was atrocious. But what is also troubling is that this scandal has a familiar ring -- one that goes back 20 years to the confirmation hearings for then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. I don't know about you, but I'm getting awfully tired of sexual harassment being the preferred line of attack against black conservatives. This isn't to say that sexual harassment is acceptable -- whether it's a proposition or the creation of a hostile work environment. But the whole thing makes me queasy in light of the ugly history in this country of black men being described in sexually charged terms. I don't care who the attack is leveled against; anyone who plays with the idea of a black man acting inappropriately toward women is playing with dynamite. Liberals who rejoice in the Cain story should remember that. Herman Cain and the decline of black conservatism . And why are black conservatives singled out for these kinds of attacks? Consider how many of them hold high office in this country. Not many. If you counted up all those who serve in the House, the Senate, and the 50 governorships, you'd still have less than a handful. Since the 1960 presidential election, African-Americans have shunned the GOP and tended to vote Democratic. Politicians who break from that tradition automatically become a target, and their critics will pummel them with anything they've got. After all, it's not like African-American men are the only ones ever accused of sexual harassment. The alleged perpetrators come in all colors. During the 1990s, even before the Monica Lewinsky scandal, President Bill Clinton could have easily become the poster boy for sexual harassment because of allegations by a former hotel worker named Paula Jones. While Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives, he long ago closed that chapter in his life, and now he's considered one of the Democratic Party's elder statesman. There was also the notorious Tailhook scandal, where more than 100 aviation officers from the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps -- most of them white -- were alleged to have sexually assaulted and/or sexually harassed more than 80 women at a gathering in Las Vegas. All this happened just one month before the Thomas hearings, and yet we're likely to remember one of these events much longer than we do the other. Somehow, it was Thomas whose name became synonymous with allegations of sexual harassment, after Anita Hill came forward in October 1991 and claimed that while he was her boss at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, he made sexual advances and created a hostile work environment. Many Americans look back at Thomas' confirmation hearings and think they were mainly about accusations that Thomas directed sexually blunt language at Hill. But for me, what they were really about wasn't dirty talk as much as dirty politics. Black conservatives ask us to think outside the box, and so -- as some people see it -- they're asking for trouble. The hearings were also about freedom -- the freedom to indulge in independent thought, even if it means biting the hands of liberal benefactors. You heard that criticism leveled at Thomas, who opposes affirmative action even though -- according to his critics -- he benefited from it. And the public humiliation that Thomas suffered remains a prime example of the liberal establishment trying to put someone in his place. Now, in an outrageous example of patronizing language that borders on hate speech, MSNBC analyst Karen Finney declared that the only reason that Cain is popular with white Republicans is because ""he's a black man that knows his place."" We could have guessed this was coming, sooner or later. In the latest installment of ""Liberals Gone Wild,"" the black Republican presidential candidate who knows his place is put in his place by a liberal commentator. Cain should be glad about one thing. As the attacks on him intensify, it proves definitively that he's moving up in the world. As voters continue to respond favorably to the fact that he's not a professional politician, he's gone from novelty act to legitimate presidential contender. When that happens, there are those in both parties who will try to destroy you. Even if it means -- just as it did 20 years ago -- hurting the country in the process. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Ruben Navarrette: Cain sex harassment charges a political attack as with Clarence Thomas .

"Washington (CNN) -- The sister of presidential assailant John Hinckley Jr. testified Tuesday that she has seen no sign that her brother represents a danger to himself or others. Diane Sims, who said she loves her brother, said she supports a proposal that would expand his visits to their mother's home in Williamsburg, Virginia, and might eventually allow him to live there as a full-time outpatient. But she said she does not think it would be a good option for him to move to the Dallas area, where she lives. ""President Bush lives not 10 minutes from me and I think it would be a concern,"" said Sims, apparently referring to concerns the Secret Service might have. Former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, moved to Dallas after they left the White House. Sims said she has no worries that Hinckley would be a risk to others in Dallas. U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman asked if it is accurate she is worried about her brother's personal safety in Dallas, since that is the city where President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. ""That's a concern to me,"" Sims said quietly. She also said she thinks a move to Dallas would place Hinckley too far away from the medical experts who have cared for him for many years. Hinckley's sister testified on the fourth day of a multiple-day hearing to discuss his future. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 1981 shootings of President Ronald Reagan, press secretary James Brady, Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy, and police officer Thomas Delahanty. All of those men survived, though Brady was shot in the head and left permanently disabled. Hinckley was staying at the home of his sister and her husband in Dallas on October 13, 1980, when, according to testimony in his 1982 trial, he went to a pawn shop to buy two .22-caliber revolvers, one of which he used to shoot Reagan and the others five months later. Only days before the purchase, three guns had been confiscated from Hinckley's luggage while he was trying to board a plane in Nashville. Hinckley posted bond, was released and flew to New York City, then spent the night in New Haven, Connecticut, where actress Jodie Foster was a college freshman student. He flew to Dallas to stay that weekend at his sister's home while she and her husband were away at a football game. On that Monday, Hinckley told her he was going out to look for a job, but, unknown to her, he bought the guns instead. The gun purchase was not mentioned in court Tuesday, and the government has not said it would be more dangerous for Hinckley to live in Dallas than anywhere else. Since his conviction, Hinckley has been living in St. Elizabeths, a government mental hospital in Washington. But in recent years he's been allowed to visit his mother's home with increasing frequency. Currently, he spends 10 days a month in Williamsburg. Under the proposal made by St. Elizabeths he would be granted two visits of 17 days each followed by six visits of 24 days. The hospital's recommendation for Hinckley's eventual release on convalescent leave asks the judge to allow Hinckley to live full time in Williamsburg ""at the discretion of the hospital"" once the eight longer visits have been completed successfully. The report was filed with the court under seal on July 29 and was not made public until Tuesday. The doctors signing the report said such leave would be permitted only upon an assessment, at the end of the new visits, that ""Mr. Hinckley is experiencing a good mental status and that he does not present as [sic] a danger to himself or others."" If so, the recommendation said, Hinckley would be ""conditionally released to reside permanently on convalescent leave."" He would be required to meet at least once a month with a psychiatrist who is already counseling him in Williamsburg and to continue his weekly visits to a therapist there. He would also be expected to continue his volunteer activities at Eastern State Hospital. However, the filing said, should Hinckley violate the terms of his convalescent leave, ""the hospital will return him to total inpatient care with due notification of the court."" If the judge were to grant convalescent leave at the hospital's discretion at the end of the eight longer visits now requested, it would be unlikely to happen until at least the fall of 2012, since as the filing requires a minimum two-week interval between each of the new visits. Hinckley would be expected at the outset to live with his widowed mother, who is turning 86 this week and is in good health. However, the hospital said should his ""mother not be available"" after Hinckley's release, his brother and sister had expressed interest ""in the housing options of independent apartments as well as Assisted Living Facilities... in the Williamsburg area."" Sims often spends time in Williamsburg when Hinckley is there and drives him back to St. Elizabeths. She was asked many questions about how the 56-year-old fits into the Virginia community. She said he feels comfortable there and has indicated he wants to stay there even when his elderly mother is no longer there. According to Sims, Hinckley likes working part time in the library of Eastern State Hospital and is comfortable with the psychiatrist and case manager/therapist he sees while in Williamsburg. Under questioning, Sims acknowledged the family does not permit a woman identified in court only as CB to visit the Hinckley home. Hinckley at one time told some of his caregivers at St. Elizabeths that he was engaged to CB, who had been a patient there. Hinckley later ended the engagement, doctors have said. Prosecutors described CB as being psychologically unstable and asked if it was accurate Hinckley's mother does not allow her to visit for fear she would have a mental breakdown at the home. Sims said that is the case. Sims said her brother never told the family he was engaged and -- quite to the contrary -- has said he's not engaged and has no plans to marry the woman. She said she is aware her brother still sees CB sometimes when the woman visits St. Elizabeths. Previously the court heard testimony that Sims had taken her brother to a singles group meeting in Williamsburg a number of years ago, and he was asked to leave. Sims said she wanted to set the record straight about what happened. She and her brother believed members of the group knew they were coming, but that was not the case, she said. The group was surprised to see Hinckley there, she said. But she said all the members were in their mid-70s and her brother would not have fit in. Sims said that when her brother goes out in the community he usually has no problems with people who recognize him. ""He's not bothered by people, he's not pointed out,"" she told the court. She said, ""He doesn't bother anybody"" either. She said Hinckley and his family members find they are able to go to certain restaurants where people know who they are but are welcoming. ""In general, the people in town have been very tolerant,"" she said. Last week, prosecutors said Hinckley had not told the truth about deviating from his approved itinerary to go to a movie while on his few hours of permitted unaccompanied time. According to a report by Secret Service agents who were watching Hinckley without his knowledge, on one outing last July, Hinckley did not attend a movie and instead went to a bookstore where he passed by an aisle of books that included an account of the day Reagan was shot. The judge noted the report did not indicate that Hinckley read that book or any similar books. ""The subject was not observed picking up and looking at specific books,"" the report says. ""One item of note is the subject stopped for a time and looked at the shelves in the American History area that contain several books about President Reagan and his attempted assassination."" Hinckley's sister said she had accompanied him to bookstores and never saw him look at any books like that. She said he gravitated to books on music and art. But in response to questioning by a prosecutor, she said she wasn't aware Hinckley had failed to go to the movies as planned on two occasions, in July and in September. Sims was asked if she ever noticed Secret Service agents keeping an eye on Hinckley. She replied the only time she has noticed surveillance is when she drives Hinckley out of her mother's gated community and back to St. Elizabeths. She said agents are always waiting in a vehicle and follow along. But at the end of a March 2011 visit, the Secret Service was not waiting, she said. According to Sims, about midway through the trip to Washington, Hinckley's brother, Scott, got a call on his cell phone from an agent who said he had been late. Sims said the agent asked the Hinckley family's location and requested that they wait for him to catch up. Sims replied the family did and was happy to cooperate with the Secret Service.

"Suzhou, China (CNN) -- In the shadow of the bustling Kaedar Electronics plant a brightly colored kindergarten sits somewhat incongruously, its playground usually empty. ""Teachers always keep the windows shut,"" explained 3-year-old Wei Xiwei, who attends the community facility but is rarely allowed outdoors. In Tongxin, a small village on the other side of the factory, the young have long gone, leaving only the old and frail behind. ""If we don't get moved out, I'll just die here soon,"" said 75-year-old Lu Baoyun. Young and old, locals living around the Kaedar plant near Shanghai in eastern China, blame the same thing for disrupting their lives: fumes from the factory. Residents say the strong odor sickens them. Kaedar reportedly produces casings for Apple's popular iPhone. With the help of concerned citizens, a coalition of grassroots environmental groups tracked alleged polluters like Kaedar during a seven-month investigation and recently published their findings in a 46-page report titled ""The Other Side of Apple (Part II)."" ""They say they are committed to ensuring the highest standards of social responsibility,"" said Ma Jun, director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs who led the effort. ""If they can't manage their supply chain, it's just empty talk."" Contacted by CNN, Apple declined to name its suppliers in China but past news reports indicated Kaedar and many of the 21 other companies listed in the environmentalists' report manufacture parts for various Apple products. Apple insists it requires that suppliers ""use environmentally responsible manufacturing processes wherever Apple products are made."" Kaedar would not comment for this report. The activists also produced a video that features accusations from people living near what they say are Apple suppliers in various parts of the country. In one part, a fisherman in central China is seen rowing his boat along a small river discolored with a yellow hue, allegedly the discharge from two local factories - one believed to be an Apple supplier. Apple declined to address specific allegations and referred CNN to its latest progress report on supplier responsibility. In the document, the company stressed that it aggressively monitors factories in its supply chain with regular, on-site audits. Apple also said it addresses relevant issues with nongovernmental organizations and industry groups. Ma said Apple has talked to his organization and he was encouraged by the company's follow-up. But he emphasized public scrutiny is the key in combating environmental violations and said his group will continue to name and shame big brands. Some 30 kilometers west of Tongxin Village, in an industrial park dotted with factories churning out electronics for the global market, residents at the Phoenix City high-rise housing complex echo the activists' sentiment. They have been complaining about the same problem as the Tongxin villagers, from Catcher-Topo, an expanding electronics plant right next to their apartments and reportedly another Apple supplier. ""Health can't be the price of wealth, right?"" said resident Miller Xu. ""In a few decades, if your health is ruined, it wouldn't matter how much money you have."" The 33-year-old engineer said he is considering moving so that his toddler son would not have to breathe what he believes is ""toxic air."" He added the residents' experience has given many pause for buying Apple products. Apple has seen phenomenal sales growth in China and opened Asia's largest Apple Store in Shanghai last week. The company announced in July its revenue from Greater China reached $8.8 billion for the first three quarters of this fiscal year, an increase of more than sixfold compared to the same period last year. ""I don't have an iPad or an iPhone mainly because I can't afford them,"" Xu said. ""But I heard many people here are boycotting the iPhone - and this factory is not the only Apple supplier with pollution problems."" CNN contacted Catcher-Topo for comments but the company declined. Officials in Suzhou, where the Catcher-Topo and Kaedar plants are located, said local factories are regularly inspected and all have met China's environmental protection code. Residents remain skeptical, however. ""Ordinary people's words are totally worthless to the authorities,"" said Lu, the elderly villager in Tongxin. ""There is simply nothing we can do."" CNN's Eunice Yoon and Xiaoni Chen contributed to this report.","Some of Apple's suppliers in China are accused of the polluting the environment .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- On September 11, 2001, Kathryn Freed watched from two blocks away as a plane hit the World Trade Center's north tower. After September 11, most of lower Manhattan was covered in thick dust from the collapsed towers. ""Honestly, it was so surreal,"" Freed said. ""We heard the plane coming -- it was very low and very loud -- and we watched it go right over our heads; we just watched it hit dead center the north tower. I stood there and watched the skin of the building come off. It looked like tinsel from a Christmas tree falling down."" A short while later, Freed saw the second plane plow through the south tower in a giant fireball. And as she headed back toward her apartment, four blocks from what was soon to be known as ground zero, the south tower collapsed, sending a plume of debris into the air and straight down her street. Freed believes that the lingering cloud of dust -- caused by the towers' collapse and the digging out of ground zero -- caused some of her long- and short-term medical problems, such as her ""WTC cough"" and other respiratory issues. She's among the many residents of lower Manhattan, emergency responders, recovery workers, commuters and passers-by to have developed serious, sometimes chronic medical problems since the terrorist attack seven years ago. A commission charged with examining the scope and depth of the attack's health effects reviewed more than 100 scientific articles published since 2001 and found that new asthma levels among residents and rescue workers were two to three times higher than the national estimates. The report by the World Trade Center Medical Working Group, issued in advance of the September 11 anniversary, also found that  two to three years after the attack, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder remained elevated among rescue and recovery workers and residents of lower Manhattan.  Interactive: More on PTSD » . But the most reassuring finding was that in all the studies they looked at, there was consistency. ""The primary finding of the report, as you synthesize the main findings from more than 100 peer review articles on the health ramifications of 9/11, is that the findings are very similar across the studies,"" Lorna Thorpe said. Thorpe, the deputy commissioner in the Division of Epidemiology at New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, is a member of the Medical Working Group. ""That is a very important characteristic to us when we are trying to say how well we understand the short- and medium-term health ramifications,"" she said. The group, appointed last year by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, is composed of 16 professionals with varied areas of expertise who include researchers, clinicians, psychiatrists, pulmonologists and environmental health experts. According to their report, there were also glimmers of good news: New diagnoses of the autoimmune disorder sarcoidosis, which were elevated among responding firefighters early on, are now back to pre-September 11 rates; early symptoms for PTSD resolved quickly for most people; and any impact on birth outcomes was small in magnitude. ""The review of existing services found that at the moment, the panoply of services that exist in New York City are sufficient for those who are stepping forward with potential 9/11 illnesses, but moving forward, additional federal support for sustaining those services is critical,"" Thorpe said, adding that the bigger the outreach effort, the greater the chance of demand to outstrip supply. According to the group, there are still many unanswered questions, including how extensively the disaster affected the health of residents, area workers and students; what kind of exposure increased risk; how persistent the mental and physical symptoms are; how prevalent depression and substance abuse are; whether there is a possibility of trade center-related cancer; and how effective is the treatment received by those who sought it. The medical working group also issued recommendations, including advocating for long-term federal funding to ensure that treatment and monitoring can continue; expanding the research into trade center-related conditions and evaluating the treatments involved; and expanding the education efforts to increase awareness of both the availability of medical resources for those affected and the clinical guidelines created to treat them. Freed believes that she was lucky in that she was ""too busy"" to develop PTSD; at the time, she was a New York council member and spent the months after the attack working to get her neighborhood back on its feet, bringing in supplies, medicine, information and services. She also continued to live in her apartment, where inches of dust had collected on the terrace, and didn't leave the neighborhood with its ever-present dust cloud for months. ""At that time, I had such a bad WTC cough -- I had gone to one of the doctors at Mount Sinai [hospital], and he basically told me to get out of the district because I was having such a hard time breathing,"" she said. ""Like everyone down there, I had a bad cough and what I thought was heartburn, but after the doctor's visit, I realized the air was so, so caustic that just breathing ended up burning your respiratory system."" To this day, Freed, who is now a civil court judge for Manhattan, suffers from the breathing problems and allergies that developed after the attack, and although she occasionally gets ""the cough,"" it doesn't bother her nearly as often. The WTC Medical Working Group is expected to issue an update every year. Freed is glad they are around, but she added, ""It might have been nice to have it seven years ago.""","Working group looked at more than 100 studies done since 2001 .

"(CNN) -- Four people in Japan have been killed amid heavy rain from a powerful typhoon that is expected to make landfall Wednesday afternoon, authorities there said. The center of Typhoon Roke, which had sustained winds of up to 167 kph (103 mph) Wednesday morning, could hit Japan's Tokai region, which includes Nagoya city -- or the Kanto region, which includes Tokyo -- in the afternoon, Japan Meteorological Agency chief forecaster Yutaka Kanda said at a news conference. At of 8:45 a.m. Wednesday, Roke's center was 280 kilometers southwest of Nagoya, where about 1 million people had been urged to evacuate. An evacuation order for about 80,000 residents of Nagoya was lifted, according to local media reports. Heavy rain fell in central and western Japan from the typhoon's outer bands on Tuesday and Wednesday. Some downpours came at up to 50 millimeters (2 inches) an hour, and some parts received more than 450 millimeters (17 inches) over a day, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK. Four people have died in Nagoya, including a 66-year-old man who fell from a roof Tuesday while trying to fix a stuck duct, city authorities said. Two other people -- a fourth-grade boy and an 84-year-old man -- were missing in Gifu prefecture, authorities said. People in the Tokai and Kanto regions should be prepared for heavy rain Wednesday, Kanda said, adding that the Kanto region may be most affected Wednesday evening. No airports were closed Wednesday, but several flights toward the Kyushu and Shikoku areas were canceled, transportation officials said.

"(CNN) -- The Florida case of a trooper ticketing a Miami police officer in his squad car for driving 120 miles per hour ""is a simple misunderstanding that has been blown out of proportion,"" the officer's attorney said Friday. Officer Fausto Lopez, 35, of Miami was handcuffed at gunpoint last month and charged with second-degree reckless driving, a misdemeanor, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. Lopez, who was speeding on the Florida Turnpike, was released shortly after, authorities said. Lopez was accused of weaving his marked police car through traffic at more than 120 miles an hour so he could be on time for his off-duty job, authorities said. He led Florida trooper D.J. Watts on a seven-minute, nearly 12-mile chase in the predawn darkness of October 11, a highway patrol report said. ""It was an unfortunate situation that happened, and although Officer Lopez may have been going too fast, the Florida Highway Patrol trooper clearly overreacted,"" Bill Matthewman, Lopez's attorney, told CNN. ""This matter was very much blown out of proportion."" ""Officer Fausto LÃ³pez is a good police officer who has worked as a uniform patrol officer on the streets of Miami for nearly six years, protecting the citizens of Miami,"" Matthewman said separately in a statement. ""The allegation that he was driving his police vehicle 120 mph is not accurate and is disputed. He was not driving recklessly, and a review of the videotape shows he was not driving recklessly."" Meanwhile, the highway patrol released the audio recording of the dispatch call made by state Trooper Donna Jane Watts as she pursued Lopez on the Turnpike, also Florida State Route 91, according to CNN affiliate WSVN. ""I don't know what agency he is. I'm on 91 almost to Sunrise. He's well over 120 and he's not stopping,"" Watts said. The audio and video of the chase were recorded at 6:30 a.m. on October 11. That is when Watts spotted a speeding vehicle on the Turnpike. ""All I can see is a white patrol car with blue or something like that, bright lights. It would be a Miami or D.O.T., and I'm sure it's not D.O.T.,"" she said to the dispatcher. Then an unidentified person on the radio tells Watts: ""If they tell you it's a patrol car, just have her back off."" Watts was driving on the turnpike when the white marked Miami police car blew by and ""crossed over all lanes of traffic,"" according to the state highway patrol report. She couldn't overtake the Miami police car ""due to the unit traveling extremely reckless, in and out of traffic at high rates of speed, in excess of 120 mph,"" according to the report. The Miami officer ignored the state patrol officer's siren and lights -- and even ""accelerated"" at times and continued changing lanes, the report said. At one point, the Miami officer slowed to 78 miles an hour, but sped up again, the highway patrol said. Finally, the Miami officer, wearing his uniform, pulled over his squad car at 6:35 a.m. in Hollywood. A state highway patrol video shows the state trooper pulling out her service handgun as she approached the police car with the officer seated behind the wheel. The Miami police officer ""stated that he was en route to an off-duty work detail and that he had to be there by 7:00 a.m.,"" Watts wrote in her report. On the Florida Highway Patrol offense report, the document lists Lopez' occupation as ""police officer"" whose employer is ""City of Miami Police Departmen(t)"" and lists the style of automobile as ""police car,"" a white 2008 Crown Victoria. Miami Police Detective Willie Moreno told CNN affiliate WFOR in Miami last month that the department will determine whether to take any action against Lopez after a judge rules on his case.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The pocketbook of a New Jersey woman whose disappearance in 2010 led authorities to the discovery of 10 sets of human remains across two Long Island, New York, counties has been found, police said Wednesday. A cell phone that authorities believe may also belong to Shannan Gilbert -- whose disappearance triggered a search that has become a hunt for a possible serial killer -- was also found on Long Island's Oak Beach, alongside a pair of jeans and shoes, according to Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer. ""We're going to do everything we can to find her,"" he told reporters. ""It is our belief her body or parts of her remains are in (an area of Oak Beach), and we will continue (to) search tonight and into tomorrow."" After Gilbert vanished in May 2010, the search for her led police seven months later to four bodies found along a quarter-mile stretch of Oak Beach. Additional remains were uncovered in subsequent months in neighboring Gilgo Beach and along beachfront property in Nassau County, about 40 miles east of New York City. Like the four victims found last December, Gilbert had advertised prostitution services on websites such as Craigslist. Gilbert's sisters have said the missing woman was an escort who was visiting a client. They said she ran from the man's house and called 911, saying someone was trying to hurt her. A man who lives a few miles from where the first set of remains were found last December told CNN that a young woman who ""looked like she was partying all night"" came to his door at about 5 a.m. on May 1, 2010. ""She was screaming 'Help me, help me!' and said somebody was chasing her,"" said resident Gustav Coletti. Wednesday's find comes after renewed search efforts by federal and state authorities in Oak Beach -- the area where Gilbert was last believed to be, at a so-called private party. ""This may be just a young lady (who) ran into the brush in hysterical state, fell down and expired for some reason,"" added Dormer. The police commissioner announced earlier this week that the investigation likely revolves around a possible serial killer -- a departure from his prior statements, in which Dormer said the bodies could be the work of multiple killers. It is not clear what prompted the change in focus toward one killer. ""What's common here is the dumping ground,"" he said. Authorities have sifted through more than 1,000 tips related to the case, with police upping the ante in their search for a culprit. The reward for information leading to an arrest -- once topping out at $5,000 -- was raised five-fold, making it the largest offered in Suffolk County history.","Search for Shannan Gilbert in 2010 led to discovery of 10 bodies on Long Island .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A day and a half after he was arrested on a drunk-driving charge, FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt co-piloted a government jet to North Carolina as part of a proficiency flight, Federal Aviation Administration officials confirmed Wednesday. The flight was planned before Babbitt's Saturday-night arrest, officials said, and took place as scheduled Monday morning. Babbitt does not appear to have violated any FAA rules by taking the flight. Since he has not been convicted of DWI, he was under no formal obligation to report the arrest, and there is no suggestion that he violated a ""bottle to throttle"" rule requiring eight hours to pass between alcohol consumption and flying. But Babbitt earned the ire of his boss -- Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood -- by not notifying him of the arrest. LaHood learned of the arrest about 1 p.m. Monday after a Virginia police department published a press release announcing the arrest. Babbitt, meanwhile, was just returning from the proficiency flight. Within an hour, the DOT issued a press release saying that Babbitt had asked to be placed on leave, and the request had been accepted. On Tuesday, LaHood told reporters he was ""very disappointed"" in the way he had learned about the arrest. Babbitt resigned later Tuesday, saying he did not want anything to ""cast a shadow"" on the FAA. The resignation brought to an end a tumultuous four days that began about 10:30 p.m. Saturday when a Fairfax, Virginia, police officer said he noticed Babbitt driving on the wrong side of Old Lee Highway, police said. Babbitt was the sole occupant of the vehicle and cooperated fully with police, according to police . Police said after it was determined that Babbitt was under the influence of alcohol, he was taken to a jail where he was charged with driving while intoxicated and released on personal recognizance. FAA officials said Babbitt had no official duties over the weekend. Babbitt did not return a reporter's phone call. On Monday, Babbitt went on a proficiency flight in an FAA aircraft, departing Reagan National Airport near Washington, flying to Hickory, North Carolina, and then on to Charlotte, where the plane landed for fuel before returning to Washington. The flight was intended as training for the FAA's new satellite-based navigation system known as Next Gen, the FAA said. The FAA said administrators with pilot's licenses are permitted to fly FAA aircraft. ""Randy Babbitt served as a licensed pilot and maintained qualifications to fly FAA airplanes on official business,"" the FAA said. ""This helps provide firsthand knowledge of the U.S. aviation system."" In this case, another pilot served as pilot in command during the flight, the FAA said. Under federal regulations, FAA-licensed pilots must notify the FAA within 60 days of being convicted of a drunk driving charge, or when they apply for medical recertification. Neither applied to Babbitt, although officials said senior officials are held to a higher standard.","Babbitt was arrested on a drunk-driving charge Saturday night .

"Washington (CNN) -- Before anyone ever heard of the Tea Party movement, there was a grass-roots conservative group from out West that shook up the political status quo. It happened in Canada more than 20 years ago, and the rebel Reform Party's rapid rise and eventual amalgamation into the political mainstream might offer some perspective on what is happening today on the U.S. political right. In particular, the Reform Party's rise split the so-called conservative vote in Canada, helping the Liberal Party win three straight elections to stay in power for 13 years. Only when Canada's conservatives came together under one banner, as the Conservative Party of Canada, did they wield the coast-to-coast clout to win enough seats in Parliament to take over the prime minister's office. ""It's hard to reconcile them all,"" Reform Party founder Preston Manning told CNN in a telephone interview. ""The argument we used is that you all need each other. You do agree on a whole bunch of other things."" Canada's parliamentary system differs from the U.S. system, with the party that holds the most seats in the House of Commons forming the government. Political labels such as conservative and liberal don't always mean exactly the same thing in the two countries. Still, a look at the Reform Party's history and influence on the Canadian political system reveals some parallels with the relatively new Tea Party movement south of the border. In the United States, the Tea Party movement has shaken up politics-as-usual with its anti-Washington sentiment that helped topple some Republican incumbents in primaries for the November congressional midterm election. The latest could be Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who trailed her Tea Party-backed but little-known opponent, Joe Miller, in the Republican primary held Tuesday. Miller led by a hairsbreadth when polls closed, but there are thousands of absentee ballots left to be counted, and the race might not be decided until next week. The success of far-right candidates such as Miller, Rand Paul in Kentucky and Sharron Angle in Nevada fostered hopes in the self-described grass-roots uprising that it could win power with its small-government, anti-deficit ideology. ""I'm very proud of my association with the Tea Party,"" said Marco Rubio, a former Florida state representative who won Tuesday's Republican Senate primary vote. ""But people misunderstand what the Tea Party movement is in America. It is not a centralized organization or a political party. It's the sentiment of everyday Americans who think that Washington has it wrong -- they're taking our country in the wrong direction. And they are looking for voices in American politics that will stand up to that and offer a clear alternative."" However, an inherent social conservatism in the Tea Party movement has exposed rifts with more moderate Republicans, much to the delight of Democrats. A main Tea Party spokesman, Mark Williams, was ousted last month after a controversial blog post about the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Abraham Lincoln, and the emancipation of the slaves. He resigned, but defended his remarks as satire. Tea Party protesters outside the U.S. Capitol were accused of using racist and anti-gay epithets against African-American and gay Democrats in March, and spitting on an African-American congressman. Republican House leaders criticized the alleged incident but said it was an isolated case, and Andrew Langer, one of the organizers of the protest over health care reform, said his ""Institute for Liberty roundly condemns the isolated incidents of intolerance that occurred. ... As a core value, the Tea Party movement believes in the precept upon which our independence was declared and this nation was founded: that all men are created equal."" In Nevada, Angle's candidacy revived what was thought to be a deeply troubled re-election bid by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Now Reid and Angle are in a tight race, due in part to concerns over some of Angle's policies and comments, such as a call to do away with the federal Department of Education. Even while Alaskans waited for a final result in the state's Senate Republican primary, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee derided Miller as ""an extremist who intends to transition-out Social Security, phase-out Medicare, and end unemployment benefits for all Alaskan families."" In Canada, Manning's Reform Party faced similar challenges in the 1990s as he tried to unite it with the Progressive Conservative Party, the traditional home of fiscal conservatives. Led by Manning, a politician's son known as a shrewd pragmatist, the Canadian reformers emerged from the Western provinces in the 1980s as a protest movement against the federal government back east in Ottawa, Ontario. In particular, they were angry at what they perceived as Ottawa's reliance on oil revenues from Alberta, a Western province, to appease Quebecers threatening a separatist movement in the nation's only francophone province. Manning built on the Western anger, attracting support by calling for stronger provincial powers and a smaller federal government and emphasizing the needs of rural communities. The Reform Party formed in 1987 and used the strength of its Western roots to win more seats than the Progressive Conservatives when the Liberal Party came to power in 1993. However, Manning's efforts to expand the party's support were stymied by a diversity of interests and agendas within its base that ranged from political moderation to extremist vitriol. In particular, issues such as gay rights and immigration caused public rifts among Reform Party members of Parliament. In one of the most memorable, two Reform lawmakers were suspended for disparaging comments about homosexuals and immigrants, and two others who criticized them for the comments ended up quitting the party over the dispute. James Harold Farney argued in his 2009 doctoral thesis at the University of Toronto that the rise of the Reform Party gave Canadian social conservatives their first political home. ""It was only when the Reform Party upset both the institutions and ideology of Canadian conservatism that social conservatives began to gain prominence in Canadian politics,"" Farney wrote. In the 1997 election, the Reform Party finished second overall to become the official opposition party in Parliament, but failed to grow beyond its Western roots. Manning realized it would never win control of Parliament, and therefore the prime minister's office, without gaining support in Eastern provinces, particularly populous Ontario. He launched an ambitious campaign to merge with the Progressive Conservatives, in a process that took years and left him on the sidelines when it finally occurred. The effort led to creation of the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance in 2000, with Manning defeated by Alberta provincial official Stockwell Day for the group's leadership. Day's fundamentalist Christian beliefs and lack of national political experience proved costly, and the Alliance -- caught off guard by a snap election called by the Liberals -- gained only six more seats in the next national election. Only when a formal merger of the Progressive Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance occurred -- creating the Conservative Party of Canada -- did it achieve Manning's goal of gaining significant support in the East. The new Conservative Party forced the Liberals to form a minority government in 2004, and then defeated the Liberals to form its own minority government in 2006. Stephen Harper, a one-time Reform legislator who left the party in 1997, became prime minister. Looking back, Manning said he stressed democratic principles within the Reform Party to try to achieve unity among its divided supporters. That meant getting fiscal conservatives, social conservatives and what he called democratic conservatives -- dedicated to grassroots democracy -- to accept a single platform. ""I argued they were not philosophically incompatible,"" Manning said. At caucus meetings and other party gatherings, he stressed open debate to ensure everyone had a voice. ""Whatever your position is, you can get up and say it,"" Manning explained. ""When everyone has a say, you vote,"" and the result stands. The idea was to use the democratic process ""to get people to disagree civilly,"" he said. ""If we can't apply democracy to reconcile these differences within the party,"" he used to argue, ""then why should the public believe we can do this on a larger scale?"" Could a similar process occur in the United States, driven by the Tea Party movement? Manning sounded skeptical. ""These people are trying to build a coalition in a political culture that tends to favor polarization,"" he said. ""That does make it difficult, because people want to go to their corners rather than come together in the center of the ring.""","Western protest movement in Canada grew into a political party .
Efforts to merge with Eastern conservative party proved difficult .

"(CNN) -- Britain's Andy Murray claimed his third title of the season with a straight sets thrashing of Donald Young of the United States to win the Thailand Open Sunday. Top seed Murray made no mistake as he swept aside Young 6-2 6-0 in just 47 minutes to add to his victories in Cincinnati and at Queen's Club in London. ""I just played really well,"" Murray told the official ATP website. ""Towards the end of the first set he started to play a bit better, but once I got up in the second I hardly made any mistakes."" Murray will now head to the Japan Open in Tokyo where the draw is headed by world number two Rafael Nadal, who beat him in the semifinals of the U.S. Open. Murray is hoping to overtake Roger Federer for the world number three spot by the end of the season. ""It's a very good start. Roger (Federer) always plays very well on the European indoor courts, so I'm sure I'm going to have to win a lot more matches if I want to finish No. 3. That's the goal and I'll keep working hard to give myself a shot at doing that,"" he added. Young could not repeat his success over Murray at Indian Wells but will move into the top 50 for the first time after his run to the final.

"(CNN) -- At least 49 people have been killed across several cities in western Syria during the past two days of fighting between pro- and anti-government forces, an opposition group said Thursday. Most of the deaths have occurred in the city of Rastan, where at least 27 people were killed amid heavy shelling, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria -- a network of opposition activists who organize and document anti-government demonstrations. Twelve others were killed in the western city of Homs, the group reported. The Syrian army has been fighting units that had defected from the military, said the LCC and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based opposition group. Many people have been critically wounded in Rastan, and it is difficult to get them first aid, the Syrian Observatory said. The Syrian government, meanwhile, says it is engaged in a campaign against terrorists. It denied reports that warplanes had raided Rastan, according to the government news agency SANA. Instead, it said, law enforcement forces backed by army units confronted ""armed terrorist groups"" who had wreaked havoc in Rastan and killed civilians. The government said seven army and law enforcement members had been killed and 32 others wounded. CNN is unable to independently confirm death tolls or events in Syria, which has restricted the access of international journalists to many parts of the country. Thursday's reports from the opposition groups coincide with a mob attack of government supporters in Damascus that U.S. ambassador Robert Ford narrowly avoided, a U.S. government official said. Ford, who has been outspoken against the Syrian government's use of violence against protesters, is seen by government supporters as an activist more than a diplomat. At the time of the attack, Ford was visiting Hassan Abdul Azim, the head of the opposition Arab Socialist Democratic Union. According to Azim, about 50 to 100 people gathered at the door to his office and began to chant loudly when Ford arrived. Some of them even tried to break down the door, he said. The crowd protested rowdily for more than two hours, he said. Azim could not confirm what Ford was attacked with, but he said that tomatoes that had apparently been thrown were cleaned up off the street afterward.","NEW: At least 49 people have been killed in the past two days, the opposition says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Beneath a simple gray stone marker that reads ""2008,"" on a gentle slope at the Los Angeles County Crematory and Cemetery, lie the unclaimed remains of the poor, the homeless, the addicted and the lonely. Several clergy members extended their arms over the spare gravesite Wednesday morning and gave a final blessing to the 1,639 people who were cremated and buried there because no family member claimed their bodies. All of the departed passed away in 2008. ""We started these ceremonies (for the unclaimed) in 1896,"" said Andrew Veis, an aide to Fourth District Supervisor Don Knabe. ""These people were sick, poor, homeless, no family. Some could not afford to pay for the cremation. The county is their ultimate safety net. We can give them a decent and respectful burial."" The numbers of the unclaimed are heartbreakingly steady. Last year, 1,698 such people were cremated here, the year before, 1,798. The cemetery must wait three years before burying unclaimed bodies. Sometimes family members suffer the double pain of losing a loved one and not being able to pay for a funeral, and then don't claim their loved because they're too broke. ""It just doesn't have to be that way,"" said Stella Inouye, a financial services coordinator for the cemetery. ""It costs $352 to bury and cremate someone taken from the county hospital and $466 if they pass away somewhere else. But (family members) can write a hardship letter and get the fees waived"" About 15 people ringed the gravesite Wednesday, most of them volunteers or social workers from L.A's downtown homeless community, Skid Row. ""These people may well have been guests at our soup kitchen or even at our house,"" said Jeff Dietrich, from Hospitality Kitchen, which provides meals for people in need. ""I feel like it's kind of a poignant situation when there are so many unclaimed bodies to be buried and so many untold stories and so many disconnected people. ""I think the important thing for us is to just try in these last few hours of their earthly presence to be a presence to them and deeply connected."" Chris Ponnet, spiritual director of care at the Los Angeles County and University of Southern California Medical Center, led the clergy. ""We gather in this sacred space where so many others are buried and trusting these nameless and named but unclaimed people into your embrace,"" the chaplain said. Other clergy offered blessings in Hindu, Buddhist and Jewish traditions. ""This is a day of eternal life,"" began Rambhoeu Brinkmann in the Hindu tradition. ""There will be for them all that they wish and more besides, in our presence."" The ceremony ended quickly and the attendees left behind grave marker ""2008,"" adorned with a yellow bow and a small collection of flowers, including roses.","More than 1,600 unclaimed bodies are cremated each year at an L.A. cemetery .

"(CNN) -- Macedonia is a small landlocked country bordering Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Kosovo and Serbia. About a quarter of its two million population lives in the capital Skopje, a city on the Vardar River brimming with evidence of a 2,500 year history that has seen it come under Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman and Yugoslav rule. The raging river divides the Albanian and Macedonian communities of Skopje. Almost two-thirds of the country's population are Orthodox Christians and a third is Muslim, according to the CIA World Factbook. As a result, the country has numerous monasteries, churches and mosques. It also plays host to a number of ancient relics dating back as far as 3,800 years. Lake Ohrid in the south west of the country -- one of the deepest and oldest lakes in Europe -- was once surrounded by 365 churches, some dating as far back as the 4th century. Macedonia lies in a seismically active region and has several hot thermal baths. There are many mountains over 2,500m in the Shar Planina range. The Lonely Planet travel guide describes the country as a ""paradise"" for outdoor types with numerous opportunities for skiing, hiking and climbing. Macedonia was the only country to emerge peacefully from the former Yugoslavia but 20 years later it still has an international identity crisis over its name. Macedonia gained independence from the former Yugoslav federation with overwhelming majority support in a referendum on September 8, 1991. To its own citizens, the country is called the Republic of Macedonia, but both the United Nations and the European Union call it the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia). The reason for the controversy is a region in Greece that is also called Macedonia. International recognition of Macedonia's independence was delayed by Greek objections to the name. Greece eventually agreed to recognize the ""former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"" designation. Most Macedonians do not like this name, and negotiations are continuing under the United Nations to find a solution, according to the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In 2001, there was an uprising of ethnic Albanians -- who make up a quarter of the population -- demanding equal rights, leading to months of violence. Peace returned later the same year with a peacekeeping operation by NATO troops and a new constitution recognizing Albanian as an official language and increasing access for ethnic Albanians to public sector jobs, including the police force. Official statistics show high unemployment at 31.7 percent as of 2010, but this does not take into account the extensive informal job market, estimated to be more than 20 per cent of GDP, according to the CIA World Factbook. Macedonia's current president Gjorgje Ivanov came to power in elections in 2009. Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski meanwhile was re-elected in parliamentary elections held in July 2011. His conservative VMRO-DPMNE party now governs in coalition with the ethnic Albanian DUI party. In his victory speech, Ivanov claimed his main priority was seeking further integration and ties with Europe. Macedonia is currently a candidate for membership of the European Union. In September 2011 Macedonia celebrated its 20th anniversary as an independent state. To mark the occasion new monuments, museums, roads and an improved airport terminal were constructed. The centrepiece was the erection of a 24 meter high statue of Alexander the Great in Skopje's Macedonia Square. The monument has caused further friction with neighboring Greece who view the warrior king as a Greek rather than Macedonian national hero. Given that it is still a relatively young country; the number of Macedonians to have left their mark on the world stage is relatively small. Some the most notable include footballer Goran Pandev, who won the European Champions League in 2010 whilst playing for Italian giants Inter Milan, and filmmaker Milco Mancevski, who received an Oscar nomination for his 1995 picture ""Before the Rain."" Humanitarian and Nobel peace prize winner Mother Teresa was also born in Skopje in 1910, although Macedonia was still part of the Ottoman Empire at this time.","Macedonia was the only country to emerge peacefully from the former Yugoslavia .

"(CNN) -- Northern Ireland's incredible golfing year continued on Saturday as Michael Hoey remained ahead of his more heralded compatriots at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in Scotland. The 32-year-old will take a three-shot lead from 2010 U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell as he seeks the biggest win of his career, and third European Tour title overall in the pro-am event played over three seaside courses. Ranked 271st in the world, he completed his third successive round of 66, this time at the tough Carnoustie course, to be on 18-under-par 198 and in pole position for the $785,000 first prize. The joint halfway leader fired five birdies and an eagle, while compatriot McDowell carded 67 at St. Andrews to be one shot clear of 2010 British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen. Hollywood A-listers hit the greens . ""Michael has always been a very talented player,"" McDowell said. ""He's a great ball-striker, has a great swing. He has always had the talent and won the British Amateur in 2001 before playing on a winning Walker Cup side. ""It's a fine line between guys who go on to become the best in the world and guys who become journeymen pros. And you wouldn't say Michael is a journeyman, he's popped up twice and won on tour, and won well each time."" South Africa's Oosthuizen shot 69 at St. Andrews to be one ahead of Northern Ireland's reigning U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy. World No. 3 McIlroy carded 66, also at the home of golf, to be tied for fourth with a group of seven players including world No. 1 Luke Donald and three-time major winner Padraig Harrington of Ireland. Donald fired a flawless nine-birdie round of 63 to tie McIlroy's 2010 course record at St. Andrews, as did Simon Dyson, with both Englishmen in final-day contention five shots behind Hoey. Masters champion Charl Schwartzel was tied for 11th after a 66 at St. Andrews, while world No. 2 Lee Westwood was another shot back on 205 after a 68 at the same course. Northern Ireland's current British Open champion Darren Clarke this week admitted he is struggling for motivation following his breakthrough major triumph in July, and that languor continued as he carded 70 at St. Andrews to be 19 shots off Hoey's pace. Hoey was also in the running in the pro-am section, as he and U.S. businessman William Farish Jr. were a shot behind England's Nick Dougherty and UK broadcaster Chris Evans. Dyson, paired with former chart-topping pop star Huey Lewis, was third. Actor Hugh Grant was tied for 56th, while Hollywood heavyweight Michael Douglas was joint 100th as he played with veteran eight-time European No. 1 Colin Montgomerie.

"(CNN) -- When Macedonia celebrated the 20th anniversary of its independence from the former Yugoslavia last month, it did so in a capital city that has been radically transformed over the past two years. Almost 20 new buildings -- and a similar number of statues, fountains and monuments -- are being built around the center of Skopje. The transformations are being made as part of a project called Skopje 2014, aimed at rebuilding a city that lost many of its landmarks in a 1963 earthquake. The centerpiece, in place in time for the anniversary celebrations on September 8, was a 22-meter statue, called Warrior on a Horse. It is widely understood to depict Alexander the Great, but has not been officially named as such because of a long-running dispute with Greece, to whom the ancient king is a national hero. There is also a new Museum of Macedonian Struggle, which opened on Independence Day, a triumphal arch, a new foreign ministry building, a new constitutional court, a new national theater and a new archaeological museum, among other buildings. Country profile: Macedonia . The official cost of the project is 80 million euros, although critics claim the final bill could be as high as 500 million euros, according to the online newspaper Balkan Insight. Skopje 2014 has divided Macedonians, some of whom say a country with more than 30% unemployment, according the U.N data, should not be spending so much on a building project. Goran Atanasovski, who runs an independent tourism website travel2macedonia.com.mk, said: ""The project splits the people, like a river between the coasts, some of them are for it, while others are not. ""The controversy for the project is mostly that Macedonia belongs to a group of countries with high unemployment level."" However, Zoran Nikolovski, the government's head of tourism, said: ""Skopje already has a totally new look from it did two years ago, and by 2014 it will have even more new buildings. Even in this global economic crisis we are building, not only buildings and attractions but also a new infrastructure and accommodation capacity, like brand new airports, roads and hotels. ""At first there was misunderstanding from people, but now they are seeing that it is really beautiful for people who live in Skopje as well as for travelers."" What do you think of the new buildings? Send in your images . Others question the taste of classic antiquity buildings and bronze statues. One Macedonian who asked not to be named said: ""I try to avoid the city center now. It has turned into a theme park. Wherever you turn there are new bronze statues and sculptures. It's as if they're trying to create a national identity. ""I would have thought in the 21st century we should be building something modern, urban and contemporary. I can't imagine any other city building a triumphal arch in the 21st century."" Regardless of personal opinions of the project, Skopje 2014 and other infrastructure investments do appear to be helping Macedonia to attract foreign tourists. Nikolovski said there had been a 25% increase in foreign tourists visiting Macedonia in the first seven months of this year, compared with the same period last year. Atanasovski said: ""Whether it was due to Skopje 2014 or not, this was first season that I've actually seen mass groups of foreign tourists with a travel guides in the downtown and the Old Bazaar. ""This is the first year when Skopje received more tourists than Ohrid, the leading tourism destination of Macedonia."" Official government statistics show a steady increase in foreign tourists arriving in Macedonia from 99,000 in 2001 to almost 262,000 last year. While the majority come from neighboring countries, there has been an increase in recent years from further afield, including Austria, Germany, Russia, Poland, Italy and Turkey. Nikolovski said: ""We have a lack of opportunities for mass market tourism because we don't have a coastline, but we do have beautiful lakes and mountains and interesting culture and history."" He said the country was also developing its gambling tourism market, with a number of casino hotels. The government has recently introduced policies to boost tourism including a reduction in sales tax on hotels and catering from 18% to 5% and subsidies to attract tour groups from certain countries. Atanasovski said: ""The previous years, usually the tour operators have been including Macedonia as a part of wider Balkan tours and haven't stayed in Macedonia longer than a day. Starting from last year, the number of nights spent in Macedonia has increased."" Regardless of money spent on grand projects and infrastructure, national pride has been given a boost from a quarter that no politician could plan. Macedonia's 20th anniversary celebrations coincided with the national basketball team unexpectedly reaching the semi-finals of the European championships. ""Honestly, I haven't seen the people of Macedonia so happy and proud before,"" said Atanasovski. ""Flags were all over, on people, on cars, on windows. People have replaced their economic problems with a smile and happiness.""","Skopje 2014 is a multi-million euro project to rebuild city center .

"London (CNN) -- The release of Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito from an Italian jail after they were cleared on appeal of killing British student Meredith Kercher has received extensive coverage throughout the European media. Britain's Daily Telegraph concentrates its reporting on the murder victim with a series of stories centered on the Kercher family. Under the headline ""Meredith's family: Knox acquittal sends us 'back to square one'"" its lead story says the family will continue to seek justice as Amanda Knox flies to Seattle via London. Quoting Meredith Kercher's father John as saying the verdict by the appeal court in Perugia was ""crazy"" and made a ""mockery"" of the original trial, it devotes much space to reporting the Kerchers' distress. Italian newspaper la Repubblica offers comprehensive coverage of the case, with picture galleries, video and a timeline. It quotes both Meredith Kercher's brother Lyle and sister Stephanie as saying they respected the court and the Italian justice system but still want the truth. ""We do not want innocent people to pay. We think that there is still much work to do,"" Stephanie Kercher is quoted as saying. El Pais, the Spanish daily, headlines its account of the appeal with a quote from the Kerchers saying ""someone out there has done it"" and includes a story about the ""forgotten victim."" Questions over ""inadequate"" DNA evidence, which featured in the courtroom battle, are examined in detail in a separate article by Andrea Rizzi, and the main story story asks ""If it wasn't Amanda, who did kill Meredith?"" Parisian daily Le Monde described the contrasting scenes inside the courtroom in Perugia as the ruling was read out: Amanda Knox breaking into sobs, portions of the audience applauding as shouts of joy could be heard from the crowd outside, and finally Arline Kercher, the mother of murder victim Meredith, sitting silent and still, as Knox was acquitted. France's Le Figaro reports on the media circus which surrounded the trial. ""Cameras from across the world transmitted the court's verdict live. Some 500 journalists followed the latest phase of this media-saturated trial, with American channels taking the acquittal for granted, after 1,448 days of preventative detention,"" it said. Throughout the case, German media dubbed Knox ""the angel with eyes of ice"" (Der Engel mit Eisaugen). Berlin-based broadsheet Die Welt tells how Knox is already on her way home to the United States, having thanked her supporters in an open letter to ""all those who wrote to me, to all those who defended me, to all those who prayed for me"" for helping her to remain hopeful while in prison. And the website of German tabloid Bild shows a photograph of the plane on which, it says, a tired Knox is ""flying to freedom"" -- after a wait in the VIP lounge at Rome's Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino airport. However, it reports that although she has been freed, ""she is still being hunted, this time by TV channels keen to secure the first big interview with her."" The DNA evidence is revisited by the British tabloid, The Daily Mail, and the BBC. In a blog commentary in the Mail, Michael Hanlon writes: ""The sensational acquittal of Amanda Knox and her co-defendant Raffaele Sollecito should serve as a warning to prosecutors the world over who rely on hi-tech DNA evidence to make their case: be careful what you wish for.

"(CNN) -- Vancouver police said Monday they are recommending 163 charges against 60 people in connection with the riots after the city's hockey team lost the Stanley Cup. Thousands of angry fans, fuming over their team's loss, wreaked havoc across downtown sections of the Canadian city in June. ""It became, by many measures, the largest crime spree in the history of (the province of British Columbia). The statistics are staggering and continue to grow,"" Vancouver Police Chief Jim Chu said in a statement. ""This is just the beginning as we expect to announce more arrests in the weeks and months ahead,"" he said. Among the 60 suspected rioters are 50 men and 10 women. The top three most common charges being recommended are: participating in a riot, mischief and break and enter, police said. Speaking in June, Chu blamed ""criminals and anarchists"" who, he said, disguised themselves as Canucks fans for the riots. ""These were people who came equipped with masks, goggles and gasoline, even fire extinguishers that they would use as weapons,"" he said then. The melee began after the Boston Bruins won their first NHL championship in 39 years, trouncing the Vancouver Canucks 4-0. Footage from the riot showed city police wading into an unruly crowd that taunted and threw debris at the officers. Vehicles were damaged and some were set ablaze. The incident echoed a 1994 Vancouver riot after a Stanley Cup loss to the New York Rangers, causing widespread damage that resulted in hundreds of arrests.","Canucks fans took to the streets and set overturned vehicles ablaze in June .

"(CNN) -- European and Spanish champions Barcelona dominate the shortlist for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or, the award given to the world's best footballer. Football's global governing body announced a 23-man shortlist for the award on Tuesday, with eight members of Josep Guardiola's Barca squad in the running for the prestigious prize. The award is a combination of the FIFA World Player of the Year accolade and France Football Magazine's Ballon d'Or, with the new incarnation of the honor awarded for the first time in 2010. Barcelona's Argentina star Lionel Messi was the inaugural winner, and he has again been nominated along with clubmates Eric Abidal, Dani Alves, Andres Iniesta, Gerard Pique, Xavi, David Villa and Cesc Fabregas, who signed from English club Arsenal in August. Is Messi the only candidate for the Ballon d'Or? Barca's Spanish rivals Real Madrid earned five nominations, including 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal. Brazil striker Neymar, 19, is the only nominee not based in Europe, having decided to stay with Santos despite being linked with several top overseas clubs. Former Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o, who this season left Italy's Inter Milan for Anzhi Makhachkala in Russia, is the only African player on the shortlist. The winner of the 2011 prize, along with the awards for the world's best female player and the finest male and female coaches, will be handed out at the second annual FIFA Ballon d'Or gala on January 9. 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or shortlist: .

"(CNN) -- Three-hundred fifty-seven. That's the number of women it took for Australia on Sunday to seize the record from the Cayman Islands for the largest bikini parade. The women, in tiny two pieces and pink visors, paraded around Surfers Paradise beach on the Gold Coast as throngs of onlookers whooped, hollered and snapped pictures. A electronic sign kept count as the women filed past: 329, 330, 331. At 332, a cheer went up as the crowd realized the parade had broken the previous record: 331, set in Grand Cayman on the Cayman Islands in June 2010. Yet, more women sauntered past. In the end, a new record was set: 357. ""And so, the record you were going for stood at 331. It was broken in the Cayman Islands last year,"" Australian Guinness World Records adjudicator Chris Sheedy told the crowd. ""And unfortunately, they have had their record smashed.""

"(CNN) -- Since the days of George Washington, U.S. presidents have carved out a long tradition of official road trips, if not by motorcade, then by railroad or horse and carriage. The first Secret Service agent killed protecting a president died on a trip with Theodore Roosevelt. In the late 1800s, President Rutherford Hayes rode railroads to visit 30 states and six territories, earning him the nickname ""The Rover,"" according to Willamette University Professor Richard Ellis. Eight presidents later, President William Howard Taft logged an average of 30,000 annual rail miles during his four-year administration. In ""Presidential Travel: The Journey from George Washington to George W. Bush,"" Ellis writes about presidential road trips, some which were tainted by tragedy. Ellis describes the first century of presidential travel as ""littered with grisly accidents, unpleasant near misses, and just plain discomfort. They are a window into the vast difference between the bureaucratized [and safe] presidential travel establishment of today and the far more haphazard and dangerous travel of yesteryear."" Theodore Roosevelt . During a 1902 road trip through New England, President Theodore Roosevelt was traveling in a carriage that collided with a trolley car, Ellis writes. The crash threw Roosevelt from the carriage and killed Secret Service agent William Craig, the first Secret Service agent to lose his life while protecting the president, according to Ellis. Living up to his ""Rough Rider"" reputation, President Roosevelt suffered only minor cuts and bruises in the crash. Zachary Taylor . A railroad trip took its toll on the health of President Zachary Taylor, Ellis said. ""When he made a railroad tour in 1849, it almost killed him."" ""He was fairly old at the time, and these trips were brutal, because before each stop on the route, the influential townspeople would get on the train and want to talk with the president,"" Ellis said. ""This meant 30 to 40 people battling for the president's attention, trying to talk to him, shake hands until they reached the town."" Taylor's trip was supposed to last a couple of months, according to Ellis. Within two weeks, he was sick and exhausted, ""and they have to take him back to the White House."" Taylor died suddenly a year later after eating a snack of cherries and milk. Andrew Jackson . In 1833, President Andrew Jackson was traveling through New York when his horse-drawn procession crossed a bridge connecting the Battery and Castle Garden. The bridge collapsed, plunging ""dignitaries of every age and shape ... into the shallow depths, all drenched, all frightened, and all struggling to regain solid ground,"" Ellis quoted from newspaper reports. Jackson was unhurt because he was at the front of the procession, which had crossed to safety just before the bridge crumbled, according to Ellis. ""The trip basically got cut short because he collapsed from exhaustion and they had to take him back to Washington,"" Ellis said. Franklin Pierce . He wasn't yet officially the president of the United States at the time, but President-elect Franklin Pierce cheated death during a railroad journey in 1853. ""A broken axle hurled Pierce's passenger car off the rails and down a steep, rocky embankment,"" Ellis said. The crash shattered the car into a ""mass of broken glass and splintered wood,"" Ellis quoted newspaper reports of the day. Pierce's young son was killed instantly, his skull ""almost mashed to a jelly."" George Washington . A storm made trouble for President George Washington in 1791 as he and his horse and carriage crossed Chesapeake Bay, according to Ellis. Washington reported that he spent the night ""in my greatcoat and boots in a berth not long enough for me by a head, and much cramped,"" before he was rescued, Ellis said. Road trips by car . For obvious reasons,  including comfort and time, presidents have not historically embraced long-distance travel by car, Ellis said, as railroad trips gave way to air travel. President Franklin Roosevelt loved traveling by car after arriving in a community on a train, Ellis said. ""He loved trains, and he loved cars,"" Ellis said. ""And he hated planes, although he did fly to Casablanca as president.""","Franklin Pierce's son was killed while on a railroad trip with president-elect .

"(CNN) -- Three women kicked off an AirTran plane bound for New York say a ""bully"" flight attendant is to blame. The passengers -- who did not know each other before the Monday flight from West Palm Beach, Florida, to White Plains, New York, but were seated in the same section of the plane -- say the incident started during boarding when a male flight attendant began roughly handling bags in the overhead bin. ""I said, 'Hey, I have breakables in that,' "" recalled Marilyn Miller, according to CNN affiliate WPTV-TV in West Palm Beach. But she said the comment only seemed to make his behavior worse. ""It was just like a bully and I found myself shaking."" Passenger Carol Gray told the TV station that she flagged the same flight attendant for help with another problem. ""I said, 'Excuse me sir, my seat is broken,' and he looked at me and said, 'I'm not talking to you,' and poked me in the arm,"" Gray told WPTV. The passengers said the flight attendant then began to get angry and told them to leave the plane, according to WPTV. That's when a third woman, who had been watching the situation unfold, told the station she decided to intervene. ""I said, 'This is crazy, they didn't do anything. Why are you doing this to them?' And he said, 'Throw her off, too,' "" Karyn Schorr told WPTV. Palm Beach County sheriff's deputies were called to the scene and stood by as the women exited the plane and went to another gate, said Eric Davis, a spokesman for the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. The women were not cited or charged with any crimes, WPTV reported. Southwest Airlines, which owns AirTran, said it booked new travel arrangements for the passengers and compensated them as ""a gesture of goodwill for their inconvenience."" ""Our goal is always to mitigate any uncomfortable situation prior to departure. Our crew assessed the environment onboard and ultimately decided to accommodate the passengers on an alternative flight,"" spokeswoman Brandy King said. ""We always prefer that a passenger walk away with a positive experience when flying our airline; we regret that didn't happen in this scenario. As we often do in these situations, we will take this opportunity to review the reports and take away any key learnings that we might uncover.""","Three passengers were asked to leave an AirTran flight .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN)  -- A suburban Atlanta high school teacher has been accused of pursuing a ""hit"" on a 16-year-old student last month, and the case is under investigation by local authorities. Randolph Forde -- who teaches at Mundy's Mill High School in Clayton County -- has been charged with making terroristic threats and was released on bond. He is currently on administrative leave from his job with pay and faces an employment hearing in early December, Charles White, a school district spokesman, said Tuesday. A Clayton County Police report says the incident occurred October 9. The suspect took a student off a school bus and told him he ""would pay him to kill the victim,"" the report says. When the student asked who the target would be, the suspect said he'd write the name on a note, it says. ""The teacher held a piece of paper up with the victim's name on it,"" said Officer Otis Willis III of the Clayton police. Attorney Terance Madden, who represents alleged target and his family, issued a statement saying that problems between the boy and the teacher go back to ""on or about September 29,"" when ""Forde allegedly called my client outside the class and asked him if he is gay."" Then ""on or about September 30,"" the two had an argument in class and Forde threatened ""to hit him in his 'effin mouth,"" Madden's statement said. ""Not only did my client report the verbal altercation and verbal threat to the vice principal of Mundy's Mill HS, he also reported that Mr. Forde asked him outside the classroom for the inappropriate question of whether he was gay,"" the statement said. ""Apparently nothing was done by the school administration to either Mr. Forde or my client, because Mr. Forde was back in the classroom on October 1, as was my client."" Madden said the school didn't take any action until after a police report was filed on October 12 about the incident. ""This forced my client's mother to have to remove my client from the high school, depriving him of his education because of fear for my client's safety at Mundy's Mill HS,"" Madden said in the statement. ""Finally Mr. Forde was allegedly removed from the school after the police report was filed and my client was able to return to school. An arrest was made on or about Oct. 14. Mr. Forde bonded out on $10,000 bond and waived his preliminary hearing,"" Madden said. Charles White, the school district's spokesman, said the district had no comment on the allegations because the issue is a personnel matter and is under review. He said it would be ""inappropriate"" for the district to release any information about the case. ""Attorneys can say anything they want,"" he said, but he added that ""there are definitely multiple sides to any story."" Forde's attorney initially could not be reached by CNN. The attorney was quoted by CNN affiliate WSB-TV as saying that Forde had been joking and didn't supply a name to anybody. White says there was to be an employment hearing Tuesday, but it had to be postponed because there had to be proper prior notice of a scheduled session under the state's open meetings law. District officials are aiming for a hearing in early December, he said. Madden calls the school district's reason for the postponement ""bunk"" and said it ""doesn't even pass the smell test."" He said the hearing was postponed because media coverage about the case had begun.","Police accuse Atlanta-area high school teacher of offering to pay one student to kill another .

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VICE.COM) -- The first time I went to Libya, in 2010, I was arrested just two days into my trip. Filming a documentary for VICE, I was detained for shooting where the authorities thought I shouldn't, beginning endless rounds of questions, emphatic yelling and head-shaking incredulity at my claims of innocence -- and, of course, the requisite implications that I was a spy. When I was finally released, I swore I would never return to the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. But that promise was quickly broken, and I found myself back in the country almost exactly a year later, in the midst of a chaotic and violent revolution. My second trip to Libya consisted of traveling from the Egyptian border to Benghazi and then onto the front lines in Misurata, embedding with a few different rebel groups along the way. I was shocked by how young many of them were. Barely past puberty and fighting with whatever they could find (one guy had a spear gun), they displayed so much heroism and courage that I would tear up while talking to them. One rebel I spoke with had left the hospital earlier that night -- despite having lost a leg -- so that he could get back to the front lines. He was offered a flight to Germany and a new prosthetic limb by an NGO, but instead snuck out of the hospital to rejoin his comrades. But the big question looming over everything was: ""Why are they fighting?"" Everyone I asked -- bankers, shop clerks, students, construction workers, oil engineers and ex-Gaddafi loyalists -- offered the same answer: ""Freedom."" It was like the end of Braveheart every time a rebel looked into my eyes and said it. One 16-year-old told me, ""I will die so the others can at least breathe free air."" Heady stuff for a teenager, especially when most of the rebels aren't old enough to have known a political system other than Gaddafism. Risking your life for freedom is one thing. But risking it for the concept of freedom is something else entirely. See the rest of The Rebels of Libya at VICE.COM . When we finally got to Misurata, it was surrounded by Gaddafi's troops and only accessible by sea. We slowly made our way toward the front, stopping periodically to talk to rebels. One 15-year-old boy I met was preparing a Grad-missile truck for battle. Beaming, he wondered whether I could ""ask Clinton and Obama for new weapons"" so that they could beat Gaddafi and he could fulfill his dream of playing for the Miami Heat or the Dallas Mavericks. As we talked, it struck me how much had changed in such a short period. This was a different Libya than the one I experienced last year -- a completely new country.","VICE embeds with rebel groups on the front lines in Libya .

"(CNN) -- Three Pakistani cricketers found guilty of corruption pleaded for leniency on Wednesday ahead of their sentencing in a British court. Former national captain Salman Butt and bowlers Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir will discover their fate on Thursday, along with agent Mazhar Majeed. Majeed, like Amir, pleaded guilty after being caught accepting money from an undercover newspaper reporter to ""spot-fix"" outcomes during a Test match against England at Lord's in August 2010. Butt and Asif unsuccessfully tried to overturn charges that they both conspired to cheat and accept corrupt funds from Majeed, having been accused of agreeing to deliver three no-ball deliveries at specified times during the match. Former Pakistan captain blames ICC for corruption in cricket . Majeed testified that he gave Asif £65,000 ($103,000) and also paid £10,000 ($16,000) to Butt and £2,500 ($4,000) to Amir after receiving £150,000 ($240,000) from a journalist working for the now defunct News of the World paper. The cheating charge carries a maximum sentence of two years plus an unlimited fine, while they could be jailed for seven years with an unlimited fine for accepting corrupt payments. Amir, a rising star in the sport at the age of 19, outlined his remorse in a statement read by his lawyer. ""First I want to apologize to Pakistan and to everyone that cricket is important to,"" he said. ""I do know how much damage this has done to the game, a game which I love more than anything else in the world. ""I did decide many months ago that I wanted to admit that I deliberately threw two no-balls at the Lord's Test last summer. But I know this was very late and I want to apologize for not saying it before. I didn't find the courage to do it at the beginning, and I know very well that made everything much more difficult."" The Pakistanis are among the lowest-paid of the main cricket nations, partly due to the loss of much-needed revenue from hosting tours. International teams have refused to visit due to security fears since the terrorist attack on the touring Sri Lanka side in Lahore in 2009.. Amir became the youngest player to take 50 Test wickets last year, but has been banned by the International Cricket Council until 2015. ""Last year was the most amazing year of my life, but also it was the worst year. I got myself into a situation that I didn't understand,"" he said. ""I panicked and did the wrong thing. I don't want to blame anyone else. I didn't want money at all. I didn't bowl the no-balls because of money. I got trapped and in the end it was because of my own stupidity. ""My dream was to be the best cricketer in the world. I'm a competitive sportsman and those two no-balls were the only moments in my cricketing life where I have not performed to the very best of my ability. And they were not moments I felt happy to be part of."" The 27-year-old Butt missed the birth of his second son on Tuesday, with the arrival coming an hour before the verdict was read. His lawyer said the player had been financially ruined by the scandal, as he would be unlikely to make a comeback when his five-year ICC ban expires. ""He's lost the captaincy of the Pakistan cricket team and this was a job he had for five weeks, they won two Tests, and this was the greatest honour of his life,"" said QC Ali Bajwa said. ""He has gone from a national hero to a figure of contempt and his ignominy is complete. He does not want to be the cause of his wife's suffering. He now has only his liberty and his family left to lose."" Asif, who turns 29 next month, has already had his career interrupted by three drug scandals. The most recent resulted in a one-year ban which ended in 2009. ""After five years out of the game, a comeback then would seem out of the question. He leaves here a broken man,"" said his lawyer Alexander Milne.","Pakistani cricketers to be sentenced in London court on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- On loan Al Ain striker Asamoah Gyan has dismissed claims that his recent move from Sunderland to the United Arab Emirates was motivated by money. Talking to CNN's Pedro Pinto, the Ghanaian also claimed there was no bad blood between him and Sunderland coach Steve Bruce after his last minute move to the Middle East. ""I'm still a player of Sunderland. I didn't have any confrontation with anyone. We are still alright. I was cool with the manager,"" he told CNN. ""People say I moved because of money....You need to be happy -- although I'm not saying I wasn't happy at Sunderland or I wasn't happy in the [English] Premier League. ""I had to decide with my family and everything and they were alright with my decision so I had to just move...it helped myself and Sunderland as well."" Gyan's move from Sunderland in the English Premier League to Al Ain, a club that hails from a city built around an oasis deep in the desert, was arguably the most controversial of the recent transfer window. The Ghanaian scored ten goals in his 34 appearances for Sunderland and appeared to have adjusted well to the fast-paced English game. But instead of building on his promising start Gyan opted to move to the Middle East instead. ""In life you have to experience things. I think moving here I don't regret at all because Al Ain is a great club and I'm ready to give everything,"" he explained. ""It's another step in my life. Although I'm still a player of Sunderland. I came on loan so I'll see how my future lies as Al Ain is an important club in Asia. I'm really, really happy to be here."" Gyan will be joined by a host of stars in this year's UAE Pro League. Maradona will be in charge of Dubai club Al Wasl, France international David Trezeguet has joined Abu Dhabi club Bani Yas whilst former Inter Milan midfielder Luis Jimenez will be playing at Al Ahli. Last year's champions, Al Jazira of Abu Dhabi, are bankrolled by Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan . Whilst there are fabulous riches to be found in the UAE Pro League, it isn't without its controversies. Attendances have been dire since the league went professional in 2008. The situation got so bad that the UAE FA disbanded the league and took it under their control last June. Yet for Gyan the draw of Asian Champions League football was enough to convince him that the standard this season will be high. ""The English Premiership is one of the best in the world. I do respect that. I enjoyed myself really last season,"" he said. ""Moving to the Asian league is another step in my life. Who knows maybe I can bring some exposure in the Asian league. I've got more fans in Africa and more fans in Europe also. ""I think the Asian league is also improving. Not just the big players going to the Asian league.

"(CNN) -- Hot summers when the city is crammed with tourists; cooler winters when the rain can swell the Arno: Florence is an all-year-round destination. Here are some of the city's seasonal highlights. A Verdi player finds a gap in the Azzurri team's defence during the 2003 Calcio Storico . Vintage clothes For a long time, image-conscious Italians wouldn't be seen dead in second-hand clothes. But recently they have started to catch up with the rest of the world when it comes to coveting the nearly new and Florence is host to the biggest used clothes fair in Italy. It's held twice yearly in February and July (Stazione Leopolda; +39 055 246 6198). Christmas in Florence Not only is the city wonderfully deserted at this time of year, but the lights that adorn every shop window give the place an almost magical feeling. You can buy everything from amber to reindeer skins at the Christmas market (Mercato di natale) in the Piazza Santa Croce from the beginning of December. Go ice-skating in the Piazza della Liberta or make for the Piazza della Republicca, home to Florence's enormous Christmas tree sparkling with 16,000 lights. On Christmas day, High Mass at the Duomo is an unforgettable experience. Scoppio del Carro, Easter Sunday Exploding the cart, or ""scoppio del carro,"" at Easter is one of the oldest and most important Florentine traditions. Decorated white oxen drag an elaborate cart stuffed full of fireworks from the Porta al Prato to the Piazza del Duomo. A dove-shaped rocket in the Duomo is lit and shoots along a wire to the cart where it ignites the rest of the fireworks: impressive pyrotechnics ensue. Tradition has it that if the first rocket flies straight, it will be a lucky year for Florentines. Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, April to June The May Music Festival is a series of classical music concerts, recitals, and operas and ballet held in venues across the city. It is internationally acclaimed and tickets are hot property, so check the Web site for scheduling and book in advance (www.maggiofiorentino.com ) Calcio Storico Fiorentino, June 24-28 This traditional game is a testosterone-fueled mix of football and fighting played by young men from the four Florentine quarters: San Giovanni, Santa Maria Novella, Santo Spirito and Santa Croce. They may look amusing in their medieval-style pantaloons but there is nothing funny about the level of competition in this fierce sport -- players often seem more preoccupied with fighting each other than getting the ball in the net, which runs the length of the pitch. An amazing spectacle, especially because it is held in the shadow of the beautiful Santa Croce church in the piazza below. Festa del Grillo (Cricket Festival), Ascension Day If you are feeling low on luck, the cricket festival, which heralds the start of spring, could boost your fortunes. Singing crickets are thought to bring good luck and in days gone by children would fashion cages and hunt for crickets to take to the Parco delle Cascine. Nowadays, the crickets are likely to be fake, but you can buy them housed in endearing pastel-painted confections with windows and roofs -- and they are still considered lucky. ..................................

"(CNN) -- At least five people were killed Saturday in the Yemeni city of Taiz amid heavy shelling and ongoing clashes between government forces and opposition fighters, according to witnesses. Four of those killed were civilians, said Abdul Haleem Mag'ashi, head of a media outreach committee within the city. The southwestern city of Taiz has been a scene of recent turmoil where opposition groups have squared off against those loyal to the country's embattled President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The heaviest clashes took place in the mountain region of Manakha, considered a stronghold for anti-government fighters. Hundreds of vehicles were left stranded while thousands of residents evacuated the area amid the fighting. ""Many of the casualties go unreported and cannot reach the medical facility,"" said Yasser Nusari, a medic in Taiz. ""Those who do reach come late, resulting in their life being lost."" CNN cannot independently confirm those accounts and the Yemeni government could not be immediately reached for comment. ""With the five killed today, the three-day death toll in Taiz alone is 28 civilians,"" said Mag'ashi. ""All of this after Saleh was granted immunity. We call on the world to help us in our mission for peace."" Saleh recently agreed to step down from power after months of protests against his 33-year rule, becoming the fourth leader to leave office as a result of unrest that has roiled much of the Middle East and North Africa this year. He had been granted immunity sparking protests among demonstrators who would like to see Saleh tried for alleged acts of violence.","Five people die in the Yemeni city of Taiz .

"(CNN) -- He grew up constantly on the move, the son of parents who were in the theater business in Australia. His mother and his stepfather say from an early age, Julian Assange has been driven by a sense of fighting for justice. Now, that battle applies to himself as well. Assange, the 40-year-old founder and public face of the website WikiLeaks, lost his battle Wednesday to stay in the United Kingdom and avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning over sex charges. ""I have not been charged with any crime in any country,"" Assange noted. It's the latest turn in a saga that has kept the often elusive, enigmatic figure in the international spotlight. Since the summer of 2010, when WikiLeaks began releasing reams of classified U.S. intelligence documents, Assange has stoked the ire of top officials in the United States and around the world. Some want him and WikiLeaks punished for what they call irreparable damage to global security. ""WikiLeaks has ... ignored our requests not to release or disseminate any U.S. documents it may possess and has continued its well-established pattern of irresponsible, reckless, and frankly dangerous actions,"" U.S. State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland said in September. Supporters contend Assange represents free speech at its finest. They say he is committed to outing injustices. Assange himself has remained stalwart that the information WikiLeaks chooses to release serves the public by exposing truths about secretive government decisions. Days ago, when WikiLeaks announced it was temporarily stopping publication to raise funds in order to stay afloat in the wake of a financial blockade by banks, Assange said, ""If this financial attack stands unchallenged, a dangerous, oppressive and undemocratic precedent will have been set, the implications of which go far beyond WikiLeaks and its work."" His parents see the makings of his persona in his youth. His mother, Christine, describes him as ""highly intelligent."" He was just 16 when she bought him a Commodore 64 computer. It was 1987, and there were no websites. Assange attached a modem to his computer and began his journey through the growing world of computer networks. ""It's like chess,"" he once told New Yorker magazine. ""Chess is very austere in that you don't have many rules, there is no randomness and the problem is very hard."" Though his mother raised him without any religious influence, she sensed that from a tender age, her son was led by a strong desire to do what he perceived as just. ""He was a lovely boy, very sensitive, good with animals, quiet and has a wicked sense of humor,"" she told the Melbourne, Australia, Herald Sun newspaper last year. Brett Assange, who raised Julian from age one and gave him his surname, says he was ""a very bright boy with a keen sense of right and wrong."" In an interview with CNN affiliate Seven News last year, he described his stepson as a ""sharp kid who always fought for the underdog."" ""Strangely enough, I always thought he would do something like this,"" Brett Assange said. ""He was always very independent. And he certainly wouldn't take 'no' for an answer. ""He always stood up for the underdog. I remember that, like with his school friends. He was always very angry about people ganging up on other people. He had a really good sense of equality and equity."" Julian Assange would go on to study mathematics and physics at the University of Melbourne. In interviews, his scientific precision shines through. In a baritone voice, he speaks in measured pace, choosing each word carefully. He can be charming yet cagey about his private life and is rarely shaken by discussions of even the most controversial revelations on WikiLeaks. He displays a broad range of interests, from computers to literature to his travels in Africa. He's the kind of person who, he says, can hack into the most sophisticated computer system, but forget to show up for an interview, or cancel at the last minute. Even when he walked out of a CNN interview last year after refusing to answer questions about the sex charges in Sweden, Assange remained cool and collected. He projected a stately demeanor helped by his profusion of gray hair -- which grew at an early age -- and an equally steely facial expression. After his initial foray into computers as a teen, Assange delved into computer encryption and grew keen on computer security. He once relayed a story about how he set up an encryption puzzle based on the manipulation of prime numbers. The New Yorker article, published last year, described how in 1991, Assange hacked into the master terminal of the telecom company Nortel, after which he developed a growing fear of arrest. He had married and fathered a child when he was only 18, but the relationship fell apart and his wife left him, taking their infant son with her. He was charged with 31 counts of hacking in Australia but in the end paid only a small sum in damages, according to the New Yorker. The young hacker began to focus his attention away from network flaws to what he perceived as wrongdoings of governments. In a 2007 blog post on IQ.org, he wrote: . ""The whole universe or the structure that perceives it is a worthy opponent, but try as I may I can not escape the sound of suffering. Perhaps as an old man I will take great comfort in pottering around in a lab and gently talking to students in the summer evening and will accept suffering with insouciance. But not now; men in their prime, if they have convictions are tasked to act on them."" IQ.org is believed to be a blog created by Assange and is registered under the name ""JA"" by the same U.S. domain company as WikiLeaks. Its Australian postal address is also the same as a submissions address for WikiLeaks. Driven by the conviction of an activist and the curiosity of a journalist, Assange founded WikiLeaks in 2006. He slept little and sometimes forgot to eat. He hired staff and enlisted the help of volunteers. Always, he protected his sources, never discussing where information came from. ""People should understand that WikiLeaks has proven to be arguably the most trustworthy new source that exists, because we publish primary source material and analysis based on that primary source material,"" Assange told CNN. ""Other organizations, with some exceptions, simply are not trustworthy."" Daniel Domscheit-Berg, a longtime volunteer and spokesman for WikiLeaks who quit his job last year, told CNN that Assange's personality was distracting from the group's original mission: to publish small leaks, not just huge, splashy ones like the Afghan War Diary. Assange took issue. ""It is my role to be the lightning rod,"" Assange said. ""That is a difficult role. On the other hand, I get undue credit."" Assange's mother told the Herald Sun that she feared her son had become ""too smart for himself."" ""I'm concerned it's gotten too big and the forces that he's challenging are too big,"" she said. CNN's Moni Basu, Mia Aquino, Atika Shubert, Ashley Fantz, Paul Armstrong, Nick Thompson, and Josh Levs contributed to this report.","""He always stood up for the underdog,"" Assange's stepfather says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Jurors in the trial of Michael Jackson's doctor worked for more than seven hours Friday before telling the judge that they had not reached a verdict and were ready to go home for the weekend. The seven men and five women deciding the fate of Dr. Conrad Murray, who is charged with involuntary manslaughter in the 2009 death of the pop icon, will resume deliberations Monday morning. Katherine and Joe Jackson, the parents of the Jackson family, were so anxious for a verdict that they spent Friday afternoon in a hotel near the courthouse so they could get there quickly. Dozens of Jackson fans filled the plaza outside of the downtown Los Angeles County courthouse, shouting slogans, waving signs and sometimes arguing with Murray supporters. The jury heard from 49 witnesses over 23 days, including Murray's girlfriends and patients, Jackson's former employees, investigators, and medical experts for each side. Prosecutor David Walgren told them Thursday the evidence that Murray caused Jackson's death is ""overwhelming"" and ""abundantly clear,"" while defense lawyer Ed Chernoff argued no crime was committed. ""If it were anybody else but Michael Jackson, would this doctor be here today?"" Chernoff asked, saying it's a negligence case that should instead be heard by the state medical board. ""He was just a little fish in a big, dirty pond,"" Chernoff said, pointing the finger at other doctors who treated Jackson, and at Jackson himself. The singer's death on June 25, 2009, was caused by acute propofol intoxication in combination with two sedatives, the Los Angeles County coroner ruled. Jurors must decide if the overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol was infused into Jackson's blood by a steady IV drip, as the prosecution contends, or if Jackson injected himself with a syringe left nearby by Murray, as the defense argues. Prosecutors argue that Murray's use of propofol in Jackson's home to treat his insomnia was so reckless it was criminally negligent. ""Conrad Murray left Prince, Paris and Blanket without a father,"" Walgren said. ""For them, this case doesn't end today, or tomorrow. For Michael's children, this case will go on forever, because they do not have a father. They do not have a father because of the actions of Conrad Murray."" Walgren argued that until Jackson's death, no one ever heard of propofol being in a home every night to put someone to sleep. He called it ""a pharmaceutical experiment on Michael Jackson ... an obscene experiment."" The defense contends Jackson self-administered the fatal overdose of drugs in a desperate search for sleep without Murray's knowing. ""What they're really asking you to do is to convict Dr. Murray for the actions of Michael Jackson,"" Chernoff said. After Chernoff finished his arguments, Walgren attacked the defense for trying to blame ""everybody but Conrad Murray, poor Conrad Murray."" ""If allowed more time to argue, I am sure they would find a way to blame Michael's son, Prince,"" Walgren said in his rebuttal. Walgren painted Murray as a selfish doctor who agreed to take $150,000 a month to give Jackson nightly infusions of propofol in his home, something an ethical doctor would never do because of the dangers. While Jackson was hooked up to a constant intravenous drip of propofol, Murray was not paying attention, the prosecutor said. Telephone records and testimony showed he was talking to Sade Anding, a Houston cocktail waitress, when he realized Jackson had stopped breathing. ""What was so important to Conrad Murray that he had to call Sade Anding at that time? What was so important to this doctor that he needed to call one of his female friends in Houston? What was so pressing that he just couldn't care for Michael Jackson, that he had to call Sade Anding?"" It will never be known how long Jackson had not been breathing when Murray dropped the phone in the middle of his conversation with Anding, the prosecutor said. ""Was Conrad Murray in another room? Did Michael Jackson yell out for help? Did he gasp? Did he choke? Were there sounds? We don't know and we'll never know, because of the neglect and negligence of Conrad Murray."" Walgren questioned why Murray waited at least 20 minutes after he found Jackson was not breathing before he asked a security guard call for an ambulance. ""To speak to a 911 operator was the only hope of Michael Jackson being revived to see another day,"" Walgren said. Paramedics arrived just four minutes after the call, but too late to save Jackson, he said. Chernoff argued that Murray depended on chef Kai Chase to send up a security guard while he was trying to revive Jackson, but she only sent son Prince. When Murray spoke with police two days after Jackson's death, it was ""to get ahead of the story,"" because he knew there would be toxicology reports showing he died from propofol and sedatives, Walgren said. ""Unfortunately, his version doesn't match up with the evidence, the phone records, the e-mails, but he knew what toxicology findings would show,"" Walgren said. Jurors heard from two anesthesiology experts who offered competing theories, Dr. Steven Shafer for the prosecution and Dr. Paul White for the defense. Walgren attacked White for his determination ""to find a theory or way to blame it on Michael Jackson."" White testified that the levels of propofol and sedatives found in Jackson's stomach, blood and urine during the autopsy convinced him that Jackson swallowed a large does of lorazepam and later gave himself a rapid injection of propofol, which led to his death. ""What you were presented from Dr. White was junk science,"" Walgren said. Chernoff defended his expert and attacked Shafer, saying he was ""not a scientist; he was an advocate. He was trying to prove a point; he was trying to prove a case."" ""Dr. White knows more about propofol than Dr. Shafer will ever, ever know,"" Chernoff said. Shafer testified that the ""only scenario"" in Jackson's death was one involving an IV drip system infusing a steady flow of propofol into Jackson over several hours before his death. Chernoff argued that the prosecution fabricated the theory because they ""desperately needed a drip,"" because ""without a drip, what Dr. Murray gave Michael Jackson would not have harmed him."" ""If Dr. Murray did what he said he did, there was no danger to Michael Jackson,"" Chernoff said. ""Michael Jackson was not going to die and it doesn't matter if you leave the room and go outside and play basketball."" Chernoff attacked the credibility of Alberto Alvarez, Jackson's former bodyguard, who testified that he saw a propofol bottle inside an empty saline bag suspended on an IV stand by Jackson's bed. Alvarez waited two months after Jackson's death to tell the story, Chernoff said. ""All of a sudden, his story becomes monumentally more compelling and more valuable,"" Chernoff said. Alvarez acknowledged he turned down a $500,000 offer for an interview, Chernoff said. ""Do you honestly believe that Alberto Alvarez is not going to cash in?"" Alavarez, who placed the 911 call from Jackson's bedroom, also testified he helped remove Jackson from the bed and performed CPR on him, but a paramedic contradicted that testimony. Investigators who found the cut saline bag and propofol bottle never photographed them together or document the bottle being inside the bag, Chernoff said. The ""bottle in a bag"" theory was even less believable because the propofol bottle had a plastic strip attached to it so it could be hung from an IV stand, he said. That strip was never used, both sides agreed. ""Dr. Murray didn't have to go through the ridiculous, absurd step of cutting a bag, propping it up into a cut IV bag, hanging it up where it could fall,"" Chernoff said. Murray, if convicted, faces up to four years in prison and the loss of his medical license.","NEW: Jury deliberations resume Monday in Conrad Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial .

"Manganese Bronze, the maker of the classic London taxi and a former niche player in Coventry's once booming car-making arena, is now the last car company in the city and enjoys the curious status of being the biggest London-listed car maker by volume. Maker of London's classic black cabs is linking with Chinese carmaker Geely. However, it is struggling with the recession. Production is down to 12 vehicles a day during a four-day week in the UK and is barely at break even. Priced between £30,000 and £34,000, they are not cheap. Regulations such as the requirements of turning circles have helped protect the company's dominant supply position in recent years -- but it has suffered a fall of up to 40 per cent in demand during the past year. In contrast to sluggish UK production, the company is working flat out to export the London cab internationally. With the start of commercial production and sales of the taxis in China by a joint venture with carmaker Geely, it pins its hopes on the London taxi becoming an affordable option for cabbies worldwide. After an aborted attempt to set up a manufacturing and sales licensing deal with Brilliance China Automotive in 2002, Manganese Bronze turned to Geely in 2006. The Chinese automaker, which has become a 20 per cent shareholder in the company, has finally begun production of London taxis in a plant in Shanghai. The joint venture, Shanghai LTI, in which Manganese Bronze holds a 48 per cent stake, hopes to sell 1,000 vehicles in China this year -- with expectations of a further 3,000 in territories beyond Asia such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Spain in the course of the next three years. Geely expects the average Chinese black cab to sell for about £10,000, with production costs as low as £4,000 on a production line capable of producing 40,000 vehicles a year. John Russell, Manganese Bronze's chief executive, does not claim demand will reach that level -- which is about 20 times the current sales rate in the UK market. But he insists the taxis can find a premium niche among operators with millions of vehicles used as taxis and minicabs worldwide. Mr Russell says: ""If we were [only] a car company, making two or three thousand cars a year, we would have gone out of business years ago. In London, taxi drivers, ""hearing tales of doom and gloom"" as they carried City bankers and hedge fund managers in the autumn of 2007 became lead indicators of consumer belt-tightening. They deferred new vehicle purchases, which now hover at about 2,000 units a year rather than the 3,000 that can be produced to meet peak demand. Manganese Bronze -- which was also affected by an embarrassing product recall last year after a series of fires in its vehicles -- has responded by cutting headcount, pay and shifts. It plans a £9.4m placing of shares in June to shore up its balance sheet -- as it has slipped into the red. If the UK business is fragile, there is no doubting the robustness of the black cabs that have rolled off the production line at Manganese Bronze's plant for several decades. London taxis typically cover between 20,000 and 30,000 miles a year -- with annual mileages of 100,000 clocked up by some cabbies in far-flung parts of Scotland. The average life span of a vehicle is 12-13 years with many taxis, often driven across shifts by different drivers, covering more than a million miles during their time on the road. The company has found innovative ways to save money, says Mr Russell. ""Two years ago, if you had stress-tested many companies for a 30 or 40 per cent fall in business, most would have predicted they could not survive,"" he says, acknowledging the ""But businessses have adjusted and found innovative ways to save money, he adds -efforts from both shopfloor and boardroom. In spite of the low Chinese production costs and production capacity, Mr Russell also insists he will maintain production for the domestic market in the UK. The joint venture should also see UK production costs cut as a result of components supplied by China. ""We can't stand on our own two feet without China,"" says Mr Russell, whose business cards are in English and Chinese characters. ""We [have] always said the business is fragile."" But he adds: ""There is significant value in being a UK producer. ""Can you imagine BMW and VW not producing in Germany?

"(CNN) -- The husband of an American woman, who has been missing for six weeks in Japan, said Thursday that she had threatened to kill herself the night she disappeared after the two argued. Vince Abad, an airman at a major U.S. Air Force facility in Japan, said he and his wife, Kelli, had fought over the phone on the night of October 26 after he had gone to see their pastor, who had helped resolve disputes between them in the past. When he returned home, his wife was gone and their two children were in bed. ""We'd had arguments before -- it didn't feel too out of place,"" Abad, 30, said. He said he assumed she had gone to stay with a friend. But when Kelli Abad, 27, didn't come back by the following morning, he became concerned and raised the alarm. Two days later, the wife's car, a Toyota SUV, was found at Cape Zanpa on the island of Okinawa, about 10 miles from the base, with her cell phone and purse inside. Also inside the car was a note, Abad said, that read, ""Love my kids, love my hubby and parents. Bye."" Cape Zanpa is known locally as a place for committing suicide, Abad said. The Japanese police, the fire department and coast guard have searched caves and cliffs in the area but have found no trace of her, the police have said. The U.S. military has been helping with the search. Family members have also attempted their own searches in the area, he said. No witnesses have come forward, despite a poster campaign in English and Japanese saying she is missing. The family is ""always hoping for the best -- that she's out there,"" Abad said. But they are also aware of the possibility that his wife ""might have decided to leave us on her own terms."" ""Right now, she's a ghost,"" he said. The couple's two young children -- a 1-year-old boy and a 4-year-old girl -- are learning to deal with their mother's absence, Abad said. In the first few weeks after Kelli Abad's disappearance, he found his daughter crying one night. When he asked her what was wrong, he said, she replied, ""We don't have a mommy.""","Kelli Abad disappeared the night that she and her husband argued, he says .

"(PEOPLE.com) -- Even as he was enjoying his 20th month of remission from Hodgkin's lymphoma, Ethan Zohn worried about a relapse. ""I don't want fear or cancer to define me, but it's always in the back of your mind,"" the former ""Survivor"" winner tells PEOPLE in a new interview. His fears were confirmed on Sept. 14, when doctors told him the cancer had returned in his chest. ""It's localized in my lung area,"" Zohn, 37, says. ""But it's good that it's not all over my body."" His girlfriend of eight years, Jenna Morasca, 30, was by his side when Zohn got the news. ""She's taking it like the rock star that she is,"" he says of Morasca, who also won Survivor.

"(CNN) -- The football world hadn't seen anything quite like it before. On Tuesday night the Turkish giants of Fenerbahce took on Manisaspor in Istanbul in what should have been an empty stadium. A pitch invasion by Fenerbahce's notoriously boisterous fans during a friendly in July had forced the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) to ban the male supporters from attending two games as punishment. Instead as many as 43,000 women and children took advantage of free tickets to fill the stands with songs, banners and passion every bit as intense as their male compatriots. ""This atmosphere was one of the kind and historic in the sense of Turkish football as well as international football,"" Fenerbahce's vice-president Ali Koc told CNN's Pedro Pinto. ""The women of Fenerbahce sports club have shown us what they can do for their club, what they can do for Turkish football and I think this was an event that was exemplary for sports."" Fenerbahce won last year's Turkish championship but a cloud has hung over the club since allegations of match fixing came to light during the summer. Several of Turkey's highest profile football figures have been arrested during the investigations which lead to the TFF withdrawing Fenerbahce from this year's UEFA Champions League group stage draw. Tuesday night's match was going to be another night of shame for Turkish football, until the TFF allowed children under 12 and an accompanying adult to attend 24 hours before kick off. By the next morning thousands of women in Fenerbahce shirts lined up for tickets and images were beamed across the globe of what was surely the highest female attendance at a men's match in world football. It was a good news story for Fenerbahce just when Turkish football needed it. ""Tuesday night we had 43,000 fans in the stadium,"" Koc told CNN. ""As you know the club is going through some troubled times with allegations of match fixing...The fans have gone beyond the call of duty to embrace the club and fight for the rights of the club."" According to Koc Fenerbahce has long pursued a more family-friendly approach and regularly attract up to 8,000 women, around 20 per cent of the crowd. ""Lot of songs, a lot of chanting and solidarity,"" Koc replied when asked how the atmosphere differed to a typical match day. ""A man has less patience waiting in line for tickets. Coming to the stadium of course men are lot more loud and more synchronized but the women were a lot more passionate and a lot more encouraging."" But the crowd was not rewarded with the victory that their efforts demanded. The match ended 1-1 but for Koc the effects will last long after the final whistle. ""I think it's important for Turkey because we [were] a candidate to host the World Cup, Olympics, European Championships and these committees are all sensitive to the abilities of the organizing host country to fill the stadiums [and] in this direction it was a big positive.""

"(CNN) -- NASA scientists say they have captured the first-ever detailed airborne measurements of a major iceberg about to break off into the sea. ""A lot of times when you're in science, you don't get a chance to catch the big stories as they happen because you're not there at the right place at the right time. But this time we were,"" John Sonntag, a scientist with the NASA survey team that captured the data said in a video posted to NASA's website. The discovery of the approximately 340-square-mile iceberg-to-be came October 14 as scientists were flying over the glacier as part of Project IceBridge, a six-year mission to map a three-dimensional view of Arctic and Antarctic ice, according to NASA. Scientists aboard the flight noticed a large crack in the glacier and asked colleagues in the United States to review satellite data to see when it appeared, according to the NASA video. Those scientists said the 18-mile-long crack, which is now between 260 feet and 820 feet wide and up to 195 feet deep, appeared in early October. The crack is the first step in the iceberg breaking off from the Pine Island Glacier and slipping into the ocean. Such events are fairly common but still major from a scientific perspective, Sonntag said. The NASA crew was able to use laser range-finding tools to create a three-dimensional map of the rift, the first time such an image has been created, said IceBridge project scientist Michael Studinger. ""It's part of a natural process but it's pretty exciting to be here and actually observe it while it happens,"" he said in an article posted to the NASA website. NASA did not indicate when the iceberg might break off from the glacier. When it does, the leading edge of the Pine Island ice shelf will have receded more than at any time since the 1940s, when the ice shelf was first mapped, NASA said.","NASA scientists discover and map an iceberg in the making .
Their observations are the first detailed airborne measurements of such a phenomenon .

"(CNN) -- Floyd Mayweather Jr. has said he is ready to make the big-money fight with newly crowned WBO welterweight world champion Manny Pacquiao happen. After victory in Las Vegas over Puerto Rico's Miguel Cotto on Saturday, Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach said the ""whole world"" now wanted to see a fight with Mayweather. Reacting to the proposition the undefeated 32-year-old, who formerly held the WBC title at welterweight, told British broadcaster Sky Sports: ""If he wants to fight Floyd Mayweather all he has to do is step up to the plate."" The twice-voted Ring magazine fighter of the year added that he felt Pacquiao's approach was one-dimensional but the Filipino would be a favorite with the crowd. ""The thing is with Pacquaio I don't see any versatility as a fighter; he's a good puncher but just one-dimensional. Is Pacquiao the greatest? ""The world's going to go 'wow' if Floyd Mayweather gets beaten. That's what everyone is looking to see. ""If I beat Manny Pacquaio do you know what they are going to say? 'You are supposed to beat him, you are Floyd Mayweather, you are the bigger man'. If I knock him out they'll say 'you're supposed to knock him out he's been knocked out before'. ""I'm in a no-win situation and when I beat him no one is going to be surprised because he's been beaten before; whatever I do to Pacquaio has been done before - he's been beaten on three occasions. And if I knock him out I don't want the world shouting because he's been knocked out twice before."" If the fight goes ahead it is expected to challenge the mark set by Oscar De La Hoya's bout with Floyd Mayweather for the most profitable in history. Money generated from pay-per-view subscriptions earned the two fighters an estimated combined total of $77 million in 2007. Mayweather, whose nickname is ""Money,"" said: ""If I go out and make $60-75 million in one night; come on - I'm not losing.""","Manny Pacquiao is the new WBO welterweight world champion .

"Canton, Georgia (CNN) -- New details emerged Thursday in the brutal slaying of a 7-year-old Georgia girl, hours after an attorney for the suspect said his client would plead not guilty. Seven-year-old Jorelys Rivera's mouth was duct-taped, and her hands and feet were bound with plastic ties, a source close to the investigation said. Authorities have charged 20-year-old maintenance worker Ryan Brunn with killing Jorelys, who was last seen alive Friday near a playground at the apartment complex where he worked in Canton, Georgia. They found her mangled body in a trash compactor there three days later, the source said. A court date for an arraignment has not been set. David Cannon Sr., one of Brunn's court-appointed attorneys, said his client will enter a ""not guilty plea"" at the appropriate time. Brunn wore an orange jumpsuit and a bullet-proof vest Thursday during his first court appearance. His hands and feet were shackled during the hearing, which lasted only a few minutes. After the hearing, defense attorney Daran Burns told reporters that his client was ""very shaken."" ""We're investigating our case,"" Burns said. ""It's obviously a very tragic case. It's a very serious case. We take it very seriously. Just give us time to do our jobs."" After Cherokee County Superior Court Judge Frank Mills read him his rights Thursday, Brunn said he understood what he was being charged with and was satisfied with his counsel. Brunn, who was arrested Wednesday, is in segregated confinement in prison and wore a bullet-proof vest Thursday due to the nature of the case, said Lt. Jay Baker, a spokesman for the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office. ""It's been a hot issue in the community. We didn't want to take any chances,"" Baker told reporters. Jesus Palomino, who lives in the apartment complex, said he attended Thursday's court appearance ""to see justice be served against this criminal that was living in my neighborhood."" ""The mood right now inside the apartment complex is very saddening, you know, it's hard to go outside without looking both ways before you even step outside your door, because you're just scared that somebody might be there,"" he said. Thursday's court appearance came after the little girl's mother called for capital punishment for the suspect. ""I don't want any charges brought against him,"" Joseline Rivera told CNN affiliate WSB. ""What I want is the death penalty. He's an animal. He killed my little angel."" Brunn has not made a public statement, but his adopted brother has said he is innocent. The warrant for Brunn's arrest charged him with murder and making false statements to law enforcement. ""The accused did unlawfully and with malice aforethought cause the death of Jorelys Rivera by hitting her on the head with a blunt object,"" it said. Authorities have said there will likely be other charges, including kidnapping and sexual molestation. The little girl's father, Ricardo Galarza, lives in Puerto Rico. He told CNN on Thursday that he last saw his daughter two years ago when she visited for the summer. She was supposed to visit for Christmas this year, Galarza said. He echoed Rivera's call for the death penalty. Meanwhile, a judge ruled that Joseline Rivera's two younger children -- Jorelys' half-siblings -- could return to the custody of family members, attorney John Connley told reporters. Authorities took away the two children, ages 4 and 1, on Saturday, a day after Jorelys went missing. The Georgia Division of Family and Children Services cited lack of supervision. Connley, who represents the children's father, did not specify which parent would have custody. A family friend said the father of the two younger children lives in Miami. Authorities said Brunn has no known criminal history. His adopted brother, Connor, told CNN affiliate WXIA-TV that the arrest was a ""big mistake."" ""I honestly think he is innocent. There's just no way he would do something like this. He's just a kind-hearted person,"" Connor Brunn said. He has spoken with Ryan, he said, who told him ""he wouldn't touch a girl like that."" ""He wouldn't ever do something like that. ... This is just all bogus. ... He knew that he was suspected but he never, like, thought that it would go to him. He was asked to help to go look for this little girl. And then he got brought into this,"" Connor Brunn said. On what friends say is Ryan Brunn's Facebook page, he described himself as being ""very outgoing"" and having ""a 'wonderful' life, family, and friends."" In July, he posted a message slamming Casey Anthony, who was acquitted of killing her daughter in Florida. He wrote that Casey Anthony should have died, ""but really she'll get hers."" Tips from the public led investigators to Brunn, who had been working at the complex since November 7, authorities said. Jorelys was abducted ""in the immediate vicinity"" of the apartment complex's playground, then taken to an empty apartment nearby, Keenan said. ""We have evidence that the murder occurred in that vacant apartment,"" he said. ""At some point, the child's body was then disposed of in the Dumpster and compacted into trash."" Authorities have said Jorelys died of blunt force trauma to the head, was stabbed and had been sexually assaulted. Neighbor Heather Johnson-Coker said residents were suspicious of Brunn after investigators found Jorelys' body in the trash compactor, which can only be operated with a key that employees at the complex have. She said the maintenance worker had mentioned the large number of vacant apartments in the complex when a boy from the area went missing for a few hours recently. ""He said, and I quote, 'It would be really easy for someone to break in and do something to one of these children,'"" Johnson-Coker said Wednesday. Connor Brunn said investigators should have focused on the complex's other maintenance workers, who also had access to the trash compactor, instead of his brother. ""I think they were looking at him because he was one of the maintenance guys there,"" he said. ""But he's just one out of what, four or five other maintenance guys that work there?"" Brunn was one of hundreds of people whom investigators interviewed in their search for suspects, Keenan said Wednesday. ""We're confident that Brunn is a killer,"" Keenan charged, but he added that the investigation will continue for months. ""We are investigating all of the past history of Ryan Brunn and piecing together what he's been doing the last several years,"" he added. ""We have sent agents to other states and also to other counties and we're going to backtrack all of his activities and make a determination if he has been involved in other crimes. He has no known criminal history to us, but we will find out."" CNN's Gustavo Valdes, Holly Firfer, Mike Brooks and Rich Phillips contributed to this report from Canton. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed from Atlanta.","NEW: A source says the 7-year-old's hands and feet were bound with plastic ties .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City shrugged off the Carlos Tevez controversy to stay in contention for the English Premier League lead with a 4-0 rout of struggling Blackburn on Saturday. Roberto Mancini's men remained level on points with leaders Manchester United, who struggled to a 2-0 win over promoted Norwich, but the victory was tempered by an injury to Sergio Aguero. The striker has made a huge impact since being signed to replace Tevez in pre-season, scoring eight league goals, but he went off with a groin problem in the first half. With his fellow Argentine suspended after refusing to come on as a substitute in the midweek Champions League defeat at Bayern Munich, Aguero started the match alongside the recalled Mario Balotelli. Is Tevez 'strike' sad for soccer? The Italian, who missed the trip to Germany, was given the nod ahead of Edin Dzeko -- another eight-goal man this season, but another City player in trouble after having to apologize to Mancini following his angry reaction when he was substituted in Bavaria. After a scoreless first half, Balotelli hit the post before young England winger Adam Johnson broke the deadlock with a superb curled effort in the 56th minute. Balotelli made it 2-0 three minutes later, then Aguero's replacement Samir Nasri settled it with 17 minutes to play on the counter-attack as home fans called for Rovers manager Steve Kean to be sacked. Montenegro defender Stefan Savic headed in Nasri's late corner to score the 20-year-old's first goal for City and leave Blackburn second from bottom with four points from seven games. Rivals Manchester United also moved onto 19 points after a victory at home to 10th-placed Norwich that manager Alex Ferguson described as ""gritty."" The visitors missed several chances, and United made them pay as midfielder Anderson scored with a rare header in the 68th minute and young substitute Danny Welbeck added another with three minutes to play. ""Our home record has been fantastic for two seasons now,"" said Ferguson, who made seven changes after United's 3-3 midweek draw with Basel in the Champions League. ""This was not a good performance but we were gritty and we never gave in. That is a fantastic quality to have."" Striker Wayne Rooney returned from injury, hitting the bar late on, and should be fit for England's Euro 2012 qualifier in Montenegro on Friday along with winger Ashley Young -- who missed the match with an ankle injury. With Chelsea traveling to Bolton on Sunday, Newcastle took the chance to claim third place after a contentious 2-1 victory at Wolverhampton. Striker Demba Ba followed up last weekend's hat-trick with a 17th-minute header from a corner, and Jonas Gutierrez doubled the lead before halftime. Wolves were denied a penalty when referee Mark Halsey wrongly ruled that Jamie O'Hara was fouled outside the area, then Steven Fletcher pulled a goal back in the 88th minute. Mick McCarthy's team were again denied when Kevin Doyle's header was controversially ruled out by the assistant official, who said the ball had already gone out of play. Fifth-placed Liverpool joined Chelsea on 13 points with a 2-0 victory in the Merseyside derby that left Everton manager David Moyes fuming. Young midfielder Jack Rodwell was sent off midway through the first half for a sliding challenge on Luis Suarez, despite clearly making contact with the ball before sending the Uruguay striker tumbling. ""The sending-off ruined the game. You get lots of questions from people asking about derbies, tackles and sendings-off but that wasn't even a bad tackle,"" Moyes said after ref Martin Atkinson handed out his 15th red card since the start of last season. Suarez won a penalty before halftime, but Dirk Kuyt's attempt was saved by Tom Howard. Striker Andy Carroll put Liverpool ahead in the 71st minute from Jose Enrique's cross after Kuyt ducked out of the way, with the club-record $50 million signing scoring his first league goal this season. Suarez sealed it with eight to play with his fourth league goal this season, leaving unhappy Everton in 11th place. Unbeaten Aston Villa moved up to sixth with a 2-0 victory that condemned Wigan to a fifth successive defeat in all competitions. Gabriel Agbonlahor scored the first-half opener and set up fellow striker Darren Bent for the second after the break. Sunderland came from two goals down to secure a 2-2 draw at home to West Brom, who scored within five minutes through James Morrison and Shane Long. New Danish striker Nicklas Bendtner scored his first for the club since leaving Arsenal with a deflected shot in the 24th minute, and Egypt winger Ahmed Elmohamady did the same when he leveled two minutes later with a header.","Manchester City level with leaders Manchester United after 4-0 win at Blackburn .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo continued his battle for scoring supremacy with fellow superstar Lionel Messi with two more goals as Real Madrid reached the last 16 of the European Champions League on Wednesday. While Messi passed the 200 mark for Barcelona with a hat-trick on Tuesday that put the titleholders into the knockout stage, Ronaldo's double in the 2-0 win against Lyon gave him 100 since moving to the Spanish capital in mid-2009. It was Real's first triumph in the French city in five attempts, and gave Jose Mourinho's team a perfect four wins from four in Group D -- with no goals conceded. Ronaldo broke the deadlock with a swerving free-kick in the 24th minute, a fitting way to bring up the nine-time European champions' 900th score in the competition. Is Messi the only real Ballon d'Or candidate? The Portugal forward doubled the lead with 21 minutes to play from the penalty spot after going down under the challenge of Mouhamadou Dabo, while the hosts hit the bar through Jimmy Briand's header. Lyon, seeking to reach the last 16 for the ninth successive season, suffered a first home defeat in 24 matches and now trail second-placed Ajax by three points ahead of the Dutch club's visit later this month. The Amsterdam side moved up to seven points with a 4-0 win at home to pointless Dinamo Zagreb. Gregory van der Wiel and Miralem Sulejmani finished off fine team moves inside the opening 25 minutes, while second-half goals from Siem de Jong and substitute Nicolas Lodeiro killed off the Croatians. Messi hat-trick puts Barcelona into last 16 . Bayern Munich stayed top of Group A with a 3-2 win at home to Napoli, which featured a first-half hat-trick from Germany striker Mario Gomez, a broken collarbone for key midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger and two red cards. The Italians pulled one back before the break through Federico Fernandez, but after Bayern lost Schweinsteiger on 53, the visitors had Juan Zuniga sent off in the 70th minute for a second booking. The Germans had defender Holger Badstuber sent off for a second yellow card, and defender Fernandez capitalized with his second goal soon after, but Gomez was denied a 20th this season -- this time from the halfway line as goalkeeper Morgan de Sanctis was forced to scramble back desperately. Manchester City beat struggling Spanish side Villarreal 3-0 to move up to second place on seven points -- three behind Bayern and two ahead of Napoli. Midfielder Yaya Toure scored his first goals since City's FA Cup final win in May, sidefooting home from the edge of the box after David Silva created space for him on the half hour and then again in the second half after waltzing into the area following a pass from Mario Balotelli. Balotelli had made it 2-0 in first-half stoppage time after earning a hotly-disputed penalty. Inter Milan edged closer to a second-round place with a 2-1 win at home to French champions Lille that left the 2009 European titleholders top of Group B. Walter Samuel headed in an 18th-minute corner and Diego Milito made up for three bad first-half misses when he converted a cross from captain Javier Zanetti on 65. Claudio Ranieri's team have now won more matches in Europe this season than domestically in Serie A. Tulio De Melo netted a late consolation for Lille, who ended the match bottom of the table on two points. Trabzonspor and CSKA Moscow both have five points after a goalless draw in Turkey, which the Russians finished with 10 men as Ivory Coast striker Seydou Doumbia was sent off for a second booking. Manchester United joined Benfica on eight points at the top of Group C after beating Romanian minnows Otelul Galati 2-0 for the second match in a row. Last season's runners-up took an eighth-minute lead through winger Antonio Valencia, while Cristian Sarghi scored a late own-goal when he deflected in a shot by England striker Wayne Rooney -- who scored both times in the first fixture. ""They made it difficult for us,"" said United manager Alex Ferguson, who celebrates 25 years in charge at Old Trafford this weekend. Benfica could only draw 1-1 at home to Basel despite taking a fourth-minute lead through Rodrigo's volley. Benjamin Huggel's 64th-minute equalizer put the Swiss side on five points ahead of the trip to Galati later this month, while Portugal's Benfica travel to England.","Real Madrid reach knockout stage with 2-0 victory away to Lyon .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A man accused of stalking television actress and singer Selena Gomez, 19, pleaded not guilty Thursday, according to a statement from the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. Thomas Brodnicki, 46, has been charged with one count of stalking the teen star, who is thought to be the girlfriend of Canadian pop singer Justin Bieber. Authorities say Brodnicki allegedly stalked Gomez this year, between July and October. He is expected to appear for a preliminary hearing on November 16. If convicted, Brodnicki could face a maximum of three years behind bars, the statement said. He also now faces a court-issued protective order, requiring Brodnicki to keep away from Gomez for a period of three years. Bail has been set at $150,000, the statement said. Brodnicki's attorney could not be immediately reached for comment.","Thomas Brodnicki has been charged with one count of stalking the teen star .

"(CNN) -- A Spanish court has reopened an investigation into an allegation that one of the world's richest men, Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, raped a young woman on a yacht on the island of Ibiza in 2008. But the prince says that not only is he innocent, but that he hasn't even been in Ibiza in more than a decade -- and that others have tried to impersonate him. The woman filed her complaint in Ibiza in August 2008, but a local judge shelved it last year, citing a lack of evidence that a crime had been committed, according to court documents. The woman appealed to the next highest court, the Balearic Island Provisional Court, which ruled that the lower court in Ibiza should reopen the investigation. According to court documents obtained by CNN, the victim argued in her appeal that the real reason the lower court tossed out the case was that the alleged perpetrator was a powerful member of the Saudi royal family. A second document shows that the lower court has complied with the latest ruling, labeling Prince Alwaleed as a person an ""imputado,"" or someone ""under official investigation,"" and is seeking a statement from him. Being named an imputado is a step short of an indictment. The Saudi prince, a billionaire and the biggest foreign investor in companies such a News Corp., said in a statement that it was not until this week that he learned of the accusation. ""These allegations are completely and utterly false,"" said a statement from his investment firm, Kingdom Holding Co. ""The alleged encounter simply never happened."" According to the statement, the prince doesn't even vacation in Spanish waters. Travel records show that he was elsewhere on the night of the alleged rape and in the company of others, the statement says. But Max Turiel, one of the lawyers for the alleged victim, says there is evidence that they want to the court to examine further. According to the court documents, the woman believed that her drink had been drugged. She sent a text message to a friend stating as much. She awoke on a yacht to find she was being sexually assaulted by a man she identified as Prince Alwaleed, according to court documents. Turiel told CNN that ""there were remains of semen"" that should be examined against the prince's DNA, as well as ""remains of a tranquilizer that produced the symptoms she had."" The evidence came from tests carried out 30 hours after the alleged rape, the attorney said, so the alcohol was gone from her body, but not the drug or the DNA. Turiel said the alleged victim's mother could answer questions from CNN, but only through e-mail. He provided responses to CNN's questions that he said were from the mother. CNN cannot independently confirm that the message was from the victim's mother. ""She wanted to reopen the case due to the huge injustice and a feeling of a helplessness; powerful people should not take undue advantage of it and have others subjected to them,"" the message said. The message described the ""man or men"" who allegedly abused the young woman as powerful individuals who threatened her on board the yacht. Asked if her daughter was afraid to appeal the case, the mother said, ""Part of the fear has a lot of dignity and that can't be bought nor scared off with threats."" The young woman, a dual Spanish and German citizen, is now 23 years old, the e-mail said. Asked for additional comment on Thursday, Prince Alwaleed's representatives did not immediately respond to CNN.","A judge rules that a lower court must reopen the rape case .

"(PEOPLE.com) -- While admitting again that she and Eddie Cibran made mistakes when they got together in 2009, LeAnn Rimes says there were tons of lies written about them, too -- but that the couple kept quiet for the sake of his children. ""You have to really take the high road a lot of the time when you want to stand on a mountain and scream like, Why are you saying this?"" the country singer, 29, said Thursday in an interview on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show."" ""We've always put his kids first,"" she added, referring to Cibran's two children from his marriage to Brandi Glanville. ""We took the kids into consideration with everything that we do. Sometimes you just want to scream. But you don't. We've learned to let it go and laugh at it, at the end of the day."" Rimes, who left husband Dean Sheremet for Cibran, acknowledges once again that the whole situation ""could've been handled a lot better. But maybe we both didn't have the tools at the time to do it properly. But I've learned a lot ... Obviously we all make choices that lead us into a different path, here and there, and you learn from those or you don't."" She added: ""It obviously brought us to the place where we are now. And we're happy, and we're married. ... I think we have both come to a really good place in our lives. And right now, I'm really at peace."" Rimes also addressed another familiar topic -- her weight. The singer has looked very thin in photos this year, but says she doesn't have an eating disorder. The media has been ""very irresponsible calling a lot of people fat or anorexic or bulimic or whatever it may be,"" she said. ""It seems like bullying now instead of really taking these diseases seriously that a lot of people are going through."" See the full article at PEOPLE.com. © 2011 People and Time Inc.

"(CNN) -- The son and wife of convicted stockbroker Bernie Madoff said they had no inkling he was running a $50 billion Ponzi scheme until he came home on a December night three years ago and gathered the family together. ""He said, 'I have a confession to make. I've been running a Ponzi scheme."" He said, '$50 billion dollars,'"" recounted Madoff's wife, Ruth, in an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" Sunday night. Madoff's youngest son, Andrew, also appeared on the show -- their first television interview since Madoff pleaded guilty in 2009 of running the largest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history. ""He said, 'Everything I've been doing is all a big lie,'"" Andrew Madoff recalled. ""And then he just started sobbing. And I was-- I-- I was shocked. I-- it was-- I felt like my head exploded. I mean, I-- I don't think if he had told me he was an alien I could've been more surprised."" Ruth Madoff was too taken aback to comprehend the significance of his admission, the son said: ""'What's a Ponzi scheme?' was her first question."" ""I said, 'It's all fake.' It means dad's not been doing what he says he's been doing,"" Andrew Madoff recalled telling his mother. ""My brother was trembling with rage. He was absolutely furious. Mark was the first one to stand up and say, 'I'm out of here,' and I immediately followed and walked out."" That night, Ruth and Bernie Madoff went to the company Christmas party, stayed half an hour and came home. The next morning, the FBI arrived to arrest Madoff -- turned in by his two sons. On December 11, 2010 -- two years to the day his father was arrested -- Mark Madoff's body was discovered hanging from a ceiling pipe in his Manhattan apartment, while his 2-year-old son slept in another room. Ruth Madoff said she blamed herself for her son's suicide and for not cutting off contact with her husband as her son had once wished. ""I just wish, until my dying day, that I had done what he wanted,"" she said. ""It's the most awful thing that could happen to anybody. Suicide of a child."" Madoff, 73, is at Butner Federal Correction Complex, a medium-security prison in eastern North Carolina. He is serving a 150-year sentence after bilking investors out of their money by masquerading as the head of a legitimate investment firm while using funds from new investors to send payments to his earlier investors, falsely portraying them as proceeds when they were actually stolen money, prosecutors said. ""I can't explain it,"" Ruth Madoff said. ""I mean I trusted him. Why would it ever occur to me that it wasn't legal? The business was -- his reputation, was almost legendary. Why would I ever think that there was something sinister going on?"" The wife and surviving son both say they will never forgive Madoff for his crimes and for what he has done to their family. ""What he did to me, to my brother, and to my family is unforgivable,"" Andrew Madoff said. ""What he did to thousands of other people, destroyed their lives -- I'll never understand it. And, I'll never forgive him for it. And I'll never speak to him again."" Madoff's criminal activities spawned a tidal wave of civil actions against the family, accusing them of profiting from the Ponzi scheme. As public outrage mounted over the crime, Ruth Madoff and her husband attempted suicide. ""I don't know whose idea it was, but we decided to kill ourselves because it was so horrendous what was happening,"" she said. """"We had terrible phone calls. Hate mail, just beyond anything and I said 'I just can't go on anymore,'"" she said. ""We took pills and woke up the next day....It was very impulsive and I am glad we woke up."" The ""60 Minutes"" interview coincides with Monday's release of the new book about the Madoff family, ""Truth and Consequences"" -- a tell-all memoir, written with the family's cooperation. In the interview, correspondent Morley Safer asked, ""You know, there's a lot of a people out there who are saying, or will be saying as they watch this, ""This is all a charade. This was something that the Madoffs set up to get themselves off the hook.'"" ""I wish it were,"" Andrew Madoff said. ""I wish it were. I wish none of this was real. You know, I knew-- I knew absolutely nothing about this-- before my father shared the information with me. And it was-- it was the most shocking and-- and terrible moment of my life.""","""Everything I've been doing is all a big lie,"" family recalls Madoff saying .

"London (CNN) -- It is a year since an 18th-century Chinese vase was sold in London for $68 million, smashing world records. Now dealers and auction houses in London are feverishly anticipating a slew of sales as part of Asian Art in London, a week-long event that has been attracting newly-wealthy Chinese buyers and collectors to the capital for over a decade. Max Rutherston, Chairman of Asian Art in London, says the week of Asian art sales and exhibitions in London has been running for 13 years, and has seen a ""Chinese art boom,"" with collectors from mainland China and Hong Kong flocking to London to check out the array of antique wares laid out in the salesrooms and galleries. Antique vases hailing from the much-sought-after 18th-century Qianlong period are going under the hammer at major auction houses Sotheby's, Christie's and Bonhams and on display at the commercial galleries, alongside decorative objets d'art and furnishings. Bonhams is selling a rare vase estimated to fetch between $8 million (£5 million) and $13 million (£8 million). The 50cm tall vase features delicate chrysanthemum blossoms in white and pink tones and bears the Qianlong seal. ""The Qianlong period is really the apex of the technical achievement for Chinese porcelain, it was a time of great prosperity that led to great opulence and magnificent objects were produced for the imperial court,"" explained Asaph Hyman, a Senior Specialist in the Chinese department at Bonhams. Sotheby's, too, is hosting a round of sales, with lots ranging from ornately decorated vases to a gilt-bronze enamel tiger, estimated to fetch between $319,000 (£200,000) and $479,000 (£300,000). All houses are anticipating that the buyers of these artifacts will be Chinese, either from Hong Kong or the mainland, with some Taiwanese customers as well. It's a trend that has become more and more pronounced in the last decade, driving prices ever higher. ""It's a true tide-change,"" said Asian art dealer Daniel Eskenazi, whose London dealership has been running for 50 years. ""The Chinese weren't allowed to buy anything under Mao and they are developing very quickly, tending to go into an area and exhausting it completely before moving onto another one,"" he continued. Westerners, who at one point collected this type of work, are being increasingly priced out of the market and are now more likely to sell than buy, said Eskenazi. ""It's very patriotic, I'd put it down to that,"" opined Sotheby's Specialist Stephen Loakes, as to why Chinese buyers are so keen to pay such large sums for antiques from their homeland. ""They want to bring back their heritage, which gives them brownie points at home and if they buy it for a lot of money, there's a status thing there too,"" added Eskenazi. The major auction houses are a regular draw to the new class of Chinese rich but so are smaller ones, such as Bainbridges, the comparatively small auction house in West London that sold the $68 million vase in 2010. ""The market is very strong and people will go to where the object is,"" said Loakes. ""You go to the most remote little auction house that's difficult to get to and with Google Maps, half of mainland China is already there,"" Eskenazi said. And with the new class of Chinese buyers entering the market right now, high prices have become normalized. ""If you start from day one at this level, then you think it's normal,"" he said. ""It's incredible, I think it will have its ups and downs but the long-term trend is that (prices will keep) going up,"" he continued. So why do Chinese buyers come to London to buy art? ""Where London's always been very lucky is in the phenomenal levels of expertise here,"" said Rutherston of Asian Art in London. ""You have world-class dealers, which is ironic because there aren't that many collectors here,"" he continued. ""It's that classic British thing of being a middleman -- the art comes in from abroad to be sold here to go abroad again. It's what we're good at,"" he said.","Newly-wealthy Chinese make yearly pilgrimage to Asian Art in London week .

"(CNN) -- Greek Prime Minster Papandreou has called for a referendum on the terms of the loans from the eurozone and IMF. Markets are now trying to fathom out the possible outcomes of this decision -- and they are not all negative. Opinion polls suggest that the loan package will be rejected by Greek voters -- but there is a huge difference between answering the casual question of a pollster and a formal referendum, and one that could mark a turning point in the history of the country. At that moment, electors will have had the time to consider all the arguments put to them and form a balanced opinion before voting. If millions of voters say yes, then the thousands of protesters who have taken to the streets of Greece in recent months may be seen as representing little more than the special interests that the total economic package is designed to remove so the country can develop into an open and competitive modern economy. But if the millions of voters reject the loan package, then what? It would be difficult to see why the eurozone should offer further assistance -- unless it was very clearly in its own interest to do so. The risk of eurozone bank failures (and knock-on effects) has been a major incentive but, by the time of the referendum, all EU banks should have been analyzed even more deeply by their regulators and recapitalization plans prepared. That analysis should be extended immediately to include counter-party risk -- the risk of a domino effect -- as it will be obvious that there will be no one to bail out the Greek banks themselves, so prudent outsiders should assume that they will all fail, and plan for the natural consequences. Immediately after the referendum, Greece will still be a member of the EU: their implicit decision to default on loans from the EU ought to carry the automatic sanction that there will be no further disbursements of EU structural funds, agricultural subsidies, EIB loans and the like. Planned capital injections of this type currently total about 7% of Greek GDP. Moreover, it would be quite unlikely that the private sector would be willing to lend to any Greek entities -- unless secured by cast-iron collateral (and contracts) outside Greece. The current Greek external deficit would then have to move into balance as there would be no financing available for excess imports. Indeed, imports would drop by around a quarter -- and swiftly. That would be an exceptionally painful process. Greece cannot leave the eurozone under the terms of the existing treaty. In principle, that treaty could be changed if all other countries agreed but that would be a lengthy process and as the risk became widely known every sensible Greek depositor would withdraw euro deposits from the Greek banks and move them abroad. Such a bank run would be the liquidity crisis that triggered the rapid collapse of the entire Greek banking system. Again, dramatically painful consequences for the economy would ensue. If opinion polls were still pointing to rejection as the day approached, any other eurozone members at risk would see these dire consequences unfolding, encouraging them to take all necessary steps to avoid a similar fate. For example, Italy is already expected to have a budget deficit in 2012 below 3% of GDP, and the current Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, has promised the eurozone heads of government to take additional measures that will ensure a balanced budget in 2013. The unfolding Greek tragedy will only encourage such states to put their probity beyond doubt, and their voters would have a very clear understanding of why their leaders were asking for such efforts. Bottom line: the eurozone ""political union"" that effectively emerged completely at the October 26 summit would see a powerful advantage in standing closely behind such members, and the eurozone in aggregate would be transformed fiscally -- especially in comparison with say the US and the UK. For the unfortunate Greeks, most of the bad news would develop in advance of the vote if the markets expected a No. But such ghastly developments might encourage voters to say Yes and accept the offers of help. However, it could just be a bit too late to avert a genuine Greek tragedy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Graham Bishop.","Opinion polls suggest Greek voters will reject eurozone bailout loans .
A 'no' vote would have wide-ranging implications for the rest of Europe .

"(CNN) -- Claudio Ranieri was delighted after guiding Inter Milan to a morale-boosting first victory this season in his first match in charge of the Italian club on Saturday. Diego Milito and Lucio scored in the last 10 minutes to secure a 3-1 victory away to 10-man Bologna which lifted the 2010 European champions away from the relegation zone and into mid-table. ""It was important to get off on the right foot. The lads needed a confidence boost,"" the veteran coach told Inter's website. ""I said it didn't matter whether we played well or badly; what mattered was that we fought for every ball to get the result. And that's what we did. ""These lads are hungry and they showed that. I was pleased with the self-sacrifice I saw in all of them. This is the right spirit."" Former Juventus, Roma, Chelsea and Valencia boss Ranieri replaced Gian Piero Gasperini, whose tactics proved both unpopular and unsuccessful in his short five-game tenure. The 59-year-old's next task is to kickstart Inter's Champions League campaign in Tuesday's trip to Russia to face CSKA Moscow, following the opening defeat by Turkey's Trabzonspor. He will again be without key Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder, whose injury is ""worse than first thought."" Inter bounced back from Tuesday's 3-1 defeat by promoted Novara as striker Giampaolo Pazzini netted the opening goal six minutes before halftime when new signing Diego Forlan and Esteban Cambiasso combined to set him up. Alessandro Diamanti leveled with a penalty in the 66th minute after Walter Samuel fouled Daniele Portanova, but substitute Milito restored the lead with nine minutes to play from the spot after he fell under contact from Archimede Morleo. Morleo was sent off, and Inter took full advantage as defender Lucio headed in a freekick by Sulley Muntari with three minutes to go. AC Milan moved up to eighth place with a much-needed 1-0 victory at home to bottom club Cesena -- the first in the league this season for the Serie A champions. Veteran Dutch midfielder Clarence Seedorf scored the only goal in the fifth minute to boost coach Massimiliano Allegri ahead of Wednesday's Champions League visit to the Sna Siro by Czech titleholders Viktoria Plzen. In Saturday's other match, Fiorentina drew 0-0 at Napoli to leave both teams in a group of five on seven points at the top of the table. Genoa, who lead on goal difference, travel to Chievo on Sunday while second-placed Juventus visit Catania and Udinese travel to Cagliari.","Inter Milan win first match this season in debut for new coach Claudio Ranieri .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin Tuesday named Anton Siluanov as acting finance minister after the influential Alexei Kudrin was forced out of the position he had held since 2000. Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov will expand his duties to include fiscal responsibilities in the government, Putin said at a meeting broadcast on state-run television. Putin said both decisions were approved by President Dmitry Medvedev, with whom Putin is set to swap roles next year. Medvedev signed an order dismissing Kudrin Monday, after a tiff stemming from a comment Kudrin is reported to have made in Washington last Saturday. Citing differences with the president, particularly related to defense spending, Kudrin said that he would not remain in a government led by Medvedev, Interfax said. The state-run RIA-Novosti news agency said Kudrin resigned. The announcement came shortly after Medvedev had given Kudrin, 50, until the end of the day to decide whether to quit. Medvedev urged that Kudrin to ""make up his mind about his political future,"" according to the non-governmental, Moscow-based Interfax news agency. Kudrin was unapologetic in a statement Tuesday. ""My statement about the fact that I do not see myself as a member of a 2012 Cabinet of ministers was well thought-out and balanced."" Under Kudrin's tenure, Russia paid off most of its foreign debt and created oil wealth funds that helped the nation weather the global economic problems of recent years, RIA-Novosti said. Siluanov, 48, has worked at the Finance Ministry for 26 years and is in charge of inter-budget relations and defense funding. But he has not been a public figure and few have heard his name. The finance shakeup comes as Putin, who served two terms as president from 2000 to 2008, announced Saturday he plans to return next year to the presidency and trade roles with Medvedev by naming him prime minister. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko contributed to this report.","Russia gets a new finance minister .

"New York (CNN) -- Police took actor Charlie Sheen to a hospital early Tuesday after responding to a call at New York's Plaza Hotel concerning ""an emotionally disturbed person,"" a law enforcement source said. Sheen's representative blamed an ""adverse allergic reaction"" to a medication for the hospitalization. ""Charlie Sheen has been discharged from a hospital in New York and is returning to Los Angeles today,"" Sheen representative Stan Rodenfield said Tuesday afternoon. ""Everything else is speculation."" Police would only identify the man as a 45-year-old white male, but a law enforecement source who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak confirmed it was Sheen. Sheen is 45. A woman was in Sheen's hotel room when police arrived, the source said. The source would not identify the woman. An ambulance carried him from the hotel to New York Downtown Hospital at 1:30 a.m., a New York Police Department spokesman said. ""What we are able to determine is that Charlie had an adverse allergic reaction to some medication and was taken to the hospital, where he is expected to be released tomorrow,"" Rosenfield said. Sheen spent at least a month this year at a Malibu, California, rehab center, but it was never disclosed what he was treated for there. A Colorado judge allowed the actor to count his time at Promises of Malibu toward a 30-day jail sentence after he entered a guilty plea in August to a charge in Aspen, Colorado. The plea deal reduced the charges from felony domestic violence charges to a misdemeanor third-degree assault count. The case stemmed from Sheen's arrest on Christmas Day after his wife, Brooke Mueller, told Aspen police he threatened her with a knife at their holiday home. Sheen's three months of unsupervised probation ends on November 2, according to an Aspen court official. Since police did not file charges relating to Tuesday's New York incident, it has no bearing on the Colorado case, the official said. The son of actor Martin Sheen, Charlie Sheen recently signed a new contract last summer to continue with his hit CBS sitcom ""Two and a Half Men.""

"(CNN) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warns that excessive partisanship could well ""hollow out"" the military, saying ""we cannot tolerate"" if Congress fails to reach an accord on debt reduction and thereby triggers hundreds of billions of dollars in across-the-board cuts. Speaking with CNN's Erin Burnett in an interview that aired Monday on the first edition of her program ""OutFront,"" Panetta said that he was prepared to slash about $450 billion from the defense budget over the next decade, as currently mandated. But he described as potentially dangerous any deeper cuts, like the $1.2 trillion that would be unavoidable if a bipartisan panel does not reach a debt-reduction accord in the coming weeks that is then passed by Congress and signed by President Barack Obama. ""If the Congress is irresponsible enough to suddenly turn on this sequester idea (leading to massive, automatic cuts to defense) because they failed to meet their responsibility, that would clearly damage our national defense,"" Panetta said. ""(Cutting) in some kind of blind fashion that basically hits everything ... is going to result in hollowing out the force. We cannot tolerate that. We still risk too many threats out there to weaken our defense."" The former CIA director, presidential chief of staff and U.S. congressman didn't appear optimistic that Congress will rise to the challenge, describing the ""inability to confront the challenges that are out there,"" divisions between political leaders and partisanship as the worst in his 40 years in Washington. Panetta added that there is merit to many Americans' view that ""Washington is dysfunctional and not able to respond to these challenges,"" like the debt issue. ""I really do think that both sides have to understand how concerned not only Americans are, but the rest of the world is, about our ability to solve the problems that face us,"" he said. The secretary spoke shortly before embarking on a trip to the Middle East and, eventually, to Belgium for a NATO meeting. On Monday, he was in Israel and visited the Palestinian territory of the West Bank. His next stop will be in Egypt. In his wide-ranging interview, Panetta addressed several issues and threats. Chief among them was Iran, which he accused of sending ""pretty sophisticated weaponry to go after Americans"" in Iraq, working to ""undermine governments in the Middle East"" and trying to ""foster (and) supply terrorism."" ""That's not what the United States does,"" he said. ""What we hope to do is work with the countries in that region so that they can have the capability to defend themselves against that kind of terrorism."" The defense chief also addressed America's ""complicated relationship with Pakistan,"" acknowledging that nation's battle with terrorism and calling it imperative to build a ""cooperative relationship."" He also pointed to -- as other top U.S. officials have in the past -- some Pakistani officials' relationship with members of the Haqqani network, which he claims goes into Afghanistan to attack U.S. troops then returns to its ""safe haven"" in Pakistan. ""They understand the threat of terrorism, but they also can't pick and choose among terrorists,"" Panetta said of Pakistani officials. ""That is where we have some differences."" Panetta addressed the growth -- and reported growing militarization -- of China, insisting his goal is to have a ""transparent"" relationship so that ""we understand each other."" That said, he noted concerns if China further develops weaponry and expands its military presence. ""For that reason, we always have to have a forward presence in the Pacific that makes very clear that we have to protect the international community ... and their ability to protect their own interests,"" he said.","U.S. defense secretary warns U.S. cannot afford $1.2 trillion in military cuts .

"(CNN) -- India's Virender Sehwag plundered the highest score in one-day international cricket as his team routed the West Indies by 153-runs Thursday to clinch their five-match series. Opener Sehwag has a reputation for fast scoring, but surpassed himself with a brutal knock of 219 off just 149 balls in India's highest-ever one-day total of 418 for five wickets in 50 overs. Sehwag broke the previous best of 200 not out by his legendary compatriot Sachin Tendulkar as he took advantage of a perfect batting wicket at the Holkar Stadium in Indore. He picked up 25 boundaries and seven sixes, surviving a dropped catch by West Indies captain Darren Sammy while on 170. He was finally caught in the deep off Kieron Pollard after putting on 176 for the first wicket with Gautam Gambhir (67) and 140 for the second with Suresh Raina (55). ""I was cheering for Sachin when he got his double-hundred and it's great to emulate that,"" the 33-year-old Sehwag told AFP. ""The pitch was great and allowed you to play your shots. I think you can get a double-hundred like this when you're experienced. The last time I played 47 overs I got 175, this time I got 200."" The West Indies, who were looking to level the series at 2-2, were always behind the run chase as debutant leg-spinner Rahul Sharma picked up three wickets in his first three overs for the home side. Only a fine 96 from wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin saved them from total humiliation as they fell 3-1 down in the series. Sehwag is skippering India in the series in the absence of the rested Mahendra Singh Dhoni and had scored just 46 runs in the previous three matches.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The Japanese government has affirmed that $29 million from its budget for post-earthquake and tsunami reconstruction is going toward extra security measures for the country's whaling fleet, angering environmental activists like Greenpeace. The whaling industry is ""siphoning money away from the victims of the March 11 triple disaster, at a time when they need it most,"" Junichi Sato, executive director of Greenpeace Japan, said this week, referring to the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis that struck Japan in March. But Tatsuya Nakaoku, an official from the Japanese Fisheries Agency, said Thursday he funds would help ""support the reconstruction of a whaling town and nearby area,"" which was devastated by the natural disasters. ""Many people in the area eat whale meat,"" he said. ""They are waiting for Japan's commercial whaling to resume and it is their hope for recovery."" The government had said earlier this year, after it passed the tsunami reconstruction budget, that it would strengthen ""measures against acts of sabotage by anti-whaling groups,"" Nakaoku said. The government earmarked a total of 498.9 billion yen ($6.4 billion) of the reconstruction budget for spending on fisheries. Of that, 2.28 billion yen has been put into extra security measures for the whaling fleet, which left port for its annual hunt Tuesday. Japan's whale hunts are conducted by the Institute of Cetacean Research, a nonprofit research organization overseen by Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. An official from the Japanese Coast Guard said the deployment of guards this year to protect the fleet from obstruction by anti-whaling activists was the largest yet, but declined to give exact numbers. The Coast Guard had previously provided protection to the fleet for its 2007-08 and 2010-11 hunts. Last season's whale hunt in the Southern Ocean was cut short when anti-whaling activists from the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society blocked strikes on the animals. Sea Shepherd said its actions saved 800 whales, and the organization has promised to be back in force this season. Japan has faced international pressure to curtail its whaling activities. In 2010, Australia initiated proceedings in the International Court of Justice to stop Japanese whaling.

"(CNN)  -- The gunman showed that he was human. Most of the others who stalked the lobby of Tripoli's Rixos Hotel were young, brash, hostile Gadhafi diehards. Yet this man in his 50s, armed with a Kalashnikov, longed to see his children. His kids were out there somewhere in the Libyan capital, he said, gunfire and explosions erupting around them. ""I really miss my family, too,"" CNN producer Jomana Karadsheh told him in Arabic. ""I really want to go out and see my family. They're worried about me."" Tears welled in the gunman's eyes. Rebels were taking over the Libyan capital. And this man, who had known nothing but the Gadhafi regime for 42 years, wanted to go home, too. It was in this moment that Karadsheh knew she had a chance. If the three dozen journalists being held against their will inside the five-star hotel for five days had a shot of being freed, it was now. At 29, Karadsheh has a lifetime of experience in hostile regions. A native of Jordan who is fluent in Arabic and English, she's a stalwart of CNN's Baghdad bureau and known for her professionalism, persistence and persuasiveness. If you encounter trouble, you want her at your side. She'd come to Libya weeks before, meeting up with CNN Senior International Correspondent Matthew Chance. She'd built relationships with the government officials, media minders and security in the hotel, including this gunman. Now she and an Arabic-speaking cameraman from another news organization were negotiating to secure the journalists' safe release. On her Facebook page, Karadsheh lists her favorite quote: ""Life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, champagne in one hand ... strawberries in the other and screaming: 'Woo Hoo! What a ride!' "" In the Rixos Hotel, Karadsheh wasn't ready for life's wild ride to end. Phoning home to say goodbye . It had become apparent days earlier that the journalists -- from an array of news organizations, including BBC, Reuters, Fox and China's CCTV -- were prisoners of a dying Gadhafi regime. The government officials and minders who'd monitored the journalists abandoned the hotel August 21. About 15 gunmen loyal to the regime remained behind, roaming the halls with Russian assault rifles. They told the journalists they could not leave the hotel. Most of the loyalists were irritable, young, reckless. They adorned their weapons with the green flag of Gadhafi's regime. To avoid contact with this volatile bunch, the journalists moved to an upper floor. A hotel chef initially took care of the group. One 21-year-old gunman -- a ""nice guy,"" Karadsheh says -- ran through the hotel with his jeans covered in the blood of his cousin, killed in the fighting outside. By Monday, tensions between the journalists and their captors escalated. Gunfire erupted outside the hotel, and smoke could be seen coming from the direction of Gadhafi's nearby compound. The gunmen were enraged. ""NATO spies,"" they shouted. ""There are spies amongst the journalists!"" They walked amid the journalists, their guns drawn. They were angry, bitter. ""This could really turn out terribly for us,"" Chance thought. The journalists tried not to antagonize. ""We all had a calm panic, if there is such a thing,"" he recalled. The gunmen's belligerence sparked paranoia ""about being taken hostage, about being held prisoner, about being executed."" ""It dawned on us: If they'd been given orders to take us as prisoners or to execute us, there was nothing we could do."" That loss of control -- the realization that their fate rested with the men holding guns -- led to the darkest thoughts: that they wouldn't make it out alive. Chance phoned his mother and wife to tell them what to do with his remains. His wife put his 5-year-old daughter on the line. If this was a final goodbye, his only child needed to hear daddy's voice. The veteran correspondent who has covered conflicts in the Balkans, Chechnya, Iraq and Afghanistan didn't tell his girl about the danger he faced. He spoke instead of the new school year. ""You're going to start school in two weeks,"" he said. ""Promise me that you'll work really hard at school."" ""Yes, Poppa, I promise you."" ""Be a good girl for me and mommy."" ""Poppa, I will."" His heart sank. He was 2,000 miles from his home in Moscow. He wanted nothing more than to see his girl on her first day of school. He just wasn't sure if he'd make it. Fighting intensified outside. Snipers fired into the hotel, shattering windows and rattling nerves. Chance and the others spent 36 hours face-down on the floor with little food or water. With frequent power outages, it was difficult to follow the events of Tripoli outside the walls of the hotel. But work kept Chance focused. He tweeted using his smartphone, used a satellite phone or called friends and dictated his thoughts. At one point Tuesday, he leaned over a balcony overlooking the hotel's interior courtyard, which the gunmen patrolled. ""I suppose you're happy now that Libyans are killing Libyans,"" one shouted. Connecting ""as a human"" The sound of artillery fire pierced the morning calm Wednesday. Journalists rustled awake. The gunmen had grown increasingly hostile the day before. The group worried about what lay in store. About 6 a.m., all of the gunmen except the older one left the hotel. Karadsheh and the Arabic-speaking cameraman approached him. A day earlier, she had overheard him telling the younger gunmen to remain calm and be good to the journalists: ""We want them to go back to their countries and say good things about us -- how Libyans are brave people."" Now Karadsheh and the cameraman told him what they understood: Gadhafi's regime had fallen. When a man who called himself a soldier entered the hotel, the gunman asked about the situation outside. ""You were out there. Tell me, what's really going on? Is it what they are telling us?"" Yes, he was told. The rebels were indeed in control.  Gadhafi's rule of Libya was over. Karadsheh seized the moment with an emotional plea. Her family missed her, she told him, as did the families of the three dozen other journalists. ""Think about your kids,"" she said. ""You're left here alone. Just let us go."" At first, the man defended Gadhafi, saying that he had brought democracy to Libya, that the nation thrived under his leadership. Earlier, he'd told Karadsheh that he was protecting the journalists. That he wanted his children to know that he'd fight to the end. Karadsheh and the cameraman reminded him that all the senior officials -- and now even his young comrades -- had abandoned him. It was time to give  up. ""Slowly, he started to change."" The cameraman slowly stripped the soldier and gunman of their weapons. Now unarmed, the man looked at the journalists and said, ""You can go now."" Karadsheh immediately began negotiating with the International Committee of the Red Cross to get cars to the hotel. Before she left, she told the man goodbye. ""Jomana, get out of here,"" he said. ""Go back home. Libya is over. There will be a bloodbath for years to come."" Chance watched nearby as his colleague talked with the guard. ""I watched this transformation these guys made from being Gadhafi hardliners to realizing that his regime was a historically past moment. That was a remarkable transition to witness. ""I think it's the most moving part of this whole crisis."" Says Karadsheh: ""In the end, we're all human. And that's what this was about, connecting with him as a human."" Stepping outside the Rixos, the journalists worried about snipers. There were none. Cars with the BBC and the International Committee of the Red Cross pulled up. They piled inside. ""Rixos crisis ends. All journalists are out!"" Chance tweeted. In the car, he called CNN. Speeding through Tripoli, he described the end of their hellish ordeal. Karadsheh sat next to him, tears streaming down her face, the weight of recent days crashing down. ""We wouldn't be here if it weren't for her,"" Chance said later. But Karadsheh praised the cameraman. ""It was a team effort."" Chance's daughter will soon see her poppa. He plans to be home for her first day of school September 5. But first he stopped at the newly named Martyr Square, where joyous Tripoli residents showered him with flowers. ""They're not celebrating my freedom,"" he said. ""They're celebrating Libya's freedom."" Karadsheh was struck by the disparate scene from a week ago, when Tripoli was filled with unhappy faces. Today, she noted, everyone seemed to wear smiles. Gadhafi's images have been torn down. ""I came out to a new Libya,"" she said. On Thursday, the day after her release, she did the unthinkable. She returned to the hotel to gather her personal belongings. ""I got a bit freaked out when we got close,"" she said. ""But the first thing I saw was a rebel flag hanging on the Rixos. I felt comfortable."" Soon, she was back in a car, crossing the border into Tunisia, headed home. As she'd told the gunman, she longs to see her loved ones.

I really couldn't ask for a better dad."" Having recently left Paris for London where Bloom is promoting his new film ""The Three Musketeers,"" Kerr admits she's already looking forward to being reunited after the shows and getting some much-needed sleep. ""I was up for hours last night as he's teething. And when he's crying, he just wants Mommy! It's such hard work.""

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has introduced a $1,000 note -- $10 trillion in the old value -- as the country battles to end cash shortages in the hyper-inflationary environment. Zimbabwe's currency is trading around Z$350 -- $35 trillion in the old value -- against U.S. dollar. However, analysts said the new note -- which can only buy a loaf of bread -- will not ease pressure on cash shortages because of the ever-increasing prices. ""It will not make even a small impact. What we need in Zimbabwe is a clear change of policies, start production and then inflation will start easing up,"" said John Robertson, an economic consultant. ""The zeros seem to be coming back no matter how often they slash them."" In August, Zimbabwe slashed ten zeroes on the currency; two years earlier the country slashed three zeros. The zeroes keep bouncing back in the country that has an inflation rate of 11.2 million -- the highest in the world. Zimbabwe's agro-based economy has been on a free-fall for more than a decade now. The situation was exacerbated by the destruction of commercial agriculture in 2000 when President Robert Mugabe's government embarked on a violent land grab from white farmers and gave it to inexperienced black farmers. Mugabe denies that he is to blame for the country's economic collapse, citing economic sanctions that have been placed on Zimbabwe. Since 2000, Zimbabwe's currency has been depreciating against major currency. It is trading around $350 Zimbabwean dollars -- $35 trillion in the old value -- against the U.S. dollar.","Z$1,000 note can only purchase a loaf of bread .

"London (CNN) -- At least seven people are confirmed dead and 51 injured in a ""horrific"" traffic accident in southwest England, Somerset police said Saturday. The accident involved 34 vehicles, including cars, vans and large trucks, police said, some of which erupted into a ""fireball."" Assistant Chief Constable Anthony Bangham told reporters more bodies are feared to be still trapped in badly burnt vehicles. Some of the vehicles are ""burnt to the ground"" and unrecognizable, he said in a televised news conference after visiting the site. ""This is a horrific scene."" The crash occurred about 8:25 p.m. Friday on the M5 highway near Taunton in Somerset, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) southwest of Bristol, according to the Devon and Somerset Fire Rescue. Bangham said poor weather was likely to have been a factor, with wet roads after rain and banks of fog reported in the area. Police were also looking into a nearby fireworks display to see if it may have played a role, he said. He praised members of the public who showed ""real bravery"" in trying to rescue people from blazing vehicles, as well as the efforts of the emergency services. ""For a motorway incident, this is just about as big as it gets,"" he said. ""This is a highly complex, very dramatic incident for our officers."" He said part of the highway would remain closed in both directions until at least Sunday. About 15 fire trucks were sent to the scene, as rescue workers battled to extinguish blazing vehicles and cut free trapped passengers.

"New York (CNN) -- Protests cropping up in more than a dozen American cities prompted President Barack Obama to discuss the phenomenon Thursday by saying demonstrators ""are giving voice"" to those frustrated ""about how our financial system works."" Speaking at a White House news conference, Obama also defended the country's financial sector, which appears to have taken the brunt of protester criticism, focusing on Wall Street and its regulators' purported role in widening economic disparities. ""We have to have a strong, effective financial sector in order for us to grow,"" the president said Thursday. Still, Obama discussed a need to pursue action aimed at improving government oversight and blamed the financial sector and Republican lawmakers for obstructing reforms. ""Not only did the financial sector, with the Republican party in Congress, fight us every step of the way,"" but now the ""same folks"" are suggesting that the country should ""roll back reforms"" and go back to ""the way it was"" before the financial crisis. Rep. Paul Ryan said Thursday that limiting federal spending was pivotal to boosting the economy. The Wisconsin Republican also urged the government to lower taxes to promote U.S.-friendly businesses and spur economic growth. Vice President Joe Biden also weighed in, comparing the protestors to the origins of the tea party, a grass-roots political movement that has advocated reductions in government spending and efforts to curb corruption. ""What is the core of that protest? And why is it increasing in terms of the people it's attracting?"" Biden asked rhetorically. ""The core is the bargain has been breached with the American people."" He added that ""there's a lot in common with the tea party."" The two movements have drawn commentary from liberal and radical conservatives, who in both cases have said there is something fundamentally wrong with America's financial and political systems. Thursday marked the 20th day of Occupy Wall Street protests, now a series of grass-roots demonstrations against income inequality, corporate greed and a list of other often loosely defined social ills. Overheard on CNN.com: Your take on the protests . New York authorities set up at least one vehicle checkpoint as police appeared in larger numbers throughout the financial district and established a perimeter around Zuccotti Park, which is considered a rallying point for the largely leaderless movement in that city. ""We hope that our message continues to resonate with everyone who has felt disenfranchised by the current state of our country,"" said Tyler Combelic, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street group. He said they plan to ""continue the protest until the message reaches every house in the United States."" What that message is remains largely unclear. Meanwhile, hundreds turned out in downtown Philadelphia near City Hall in a similar demonstration. Crowds also gathered in the Texas cities of San Antonio, Austin, Houston and Dallas, while more protests cropped up in Portland, Oregon; San Francisco, Seattle and Tampa, Florida. Like-minded university students staged walk-outs a day before on college campuses such as North Carolina State University and the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. And still more demonstrations took place Thursday in Jersey City, New Jersey, and Los Angeles, where police say 10 people were arrested for trespassing on Bank of America property. In the nation's capital, a war protest on Thursday -- scheduled the day before the 10-year anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan -- quickly turned their concerns to economics. Several hundred set to demonstrate against wars in Iraq and Afghanistan also echoed the voices of protesters in other cities, even bringing their rally to in front of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce building. A day before, thousands marched in Lower Manhattan shouting slogans and waving placards as they meandered from Zuccotti Park to Foley Square near City Hall. That event turned violent later Wednesday evening, as some protesters scuffled with police, resulting in the arrest of 23 people for various offenses. One of them is charged with assaulting a police officer. Video taken by various news agencies showed police officers wielding batons and forcing protesters to the ground as the officers made arrests. Other videos emerged on You Tube and other Internet sites, showing police officers swinging batons at demonstrators. Still, it was not clear what prompted the exchanges. The city's Deputy Police Commissioner Paul J. Browne said five people were detained after charging a police line. The majority of Wednesday's protests, however, were peaceful and appeared buoyed by the support of local unions, including the United Federation of Teachers, Transport Workers Union and the United Auto Workers. The broader protest campaign -- which uses the hashtag #occupywallstreet on the microblogging site Twitter -- began in July with the launch of a campaign website calling for a march and sit-in at the New York Stock Exchange. While the fledgling movement since has struggled to define its mission, its participants have generally agreed in their criticism of the country's wealthiest 1% and their purported influence. The protests seemed to gain momentum after a September 24 pepper spray incident involving demonstrators and police. And last Saturday, police arrested hundreds as they marched across a roadway leading to the Brooklyn Bridge, blocking city traffic for hours. Social media sites such as Twitter seemed to be spurring similar protests elsewhere, though in vastly smaller numbers than those in New York. That includes dozens who gathered in Boston; Hartford, Connecticut; and Savannah, Georgia.

"London (CNN) -- Gary Speed's agent and friend Hayden Evans has told CNN the reasons why the Wales football manager took his own life may never be known. Speed's death provoked shock and disbelief within the world of soccer after his body was found at his home on Sunday morning. The 42-year-old had a long and distinguished playing career, making 535 appearances in the English Premier League for clubs including Leeds United, Everton, Newcastle United and Bolton. He also appeared 85 times for Wales -- a record for an outfield player. He was appointed manager of the national side in 2010 and had recently inspired Wales to a best-ever world ranking of 45. Welsh international manager Speed found dead . An inquest into Speed's death was opened and adjourned at Cheshire Coroner's office Tuesday, when it was confirmed he had hung himself. The inquest heard that Speed's wife Louise had found his body at around 7am on Sunday. Evans, who had Speed as best man at his wedding, told CNN World Sport the reason behind his friend's death may forever remain a mystery. Asked what might have been the cause for Speed's suicide he said: ""I genuinely don't know -- I haven't got a clue. It's the shock, that's what makes it all the more difficult to accept and comprehend. ""It's that sense of shock, whatever has gone on, I just don't know whether that will rest with Gary in peace or not."" Memorials for Speed have appeared at many of his former clubs with fans leaving flowers, shirts, scarves and flags at the stadiums of Leeds, where Speed started his career, at Everton, the team he supported as a boy, and Newcastle, with whom he played in the prestigious European Champions League. On Tuesday the Premier League announced there would be a minute's applause before every weekend match in Speed's honor. In a statement they called him an ""iconic player."" ""We're beginning to realize what an impact he did have on most people he crossed paths with,"" Evans added. He also said Speed's wife and his two young sons had been overwhelmed by the support they had received from around the world. ""I guess if you want to try and find any positives it is that they are a strong family unit, they support each other and supported Gary throughout his career, every move he ever made,"" Evans said. ""It's that strength that I'm trying to tell them will ultimately see them through. They'll never ever get over it but it will see them through."" It has been suggested in some quarters that Speed may have suffered from depression or some other form of illness, but Evans says none of his family or friends ever saw any evidence to back the theory. He added: ""I'm no expert, but the people close to him, the people that socialized with him, saw him and talked to him every day, not one of us had any detection of any signs of depression. Speed appeared on a football show on Saturday and spent time with former colleagues, Gary McAllister, with whom he played at Leeds, and ex-England and Newcastle captain Alan Shearer. Evans added: ""I had texts from Gary on Saturday and it was just everything as normal.""","Wales manager Gary Speed was found dead at his home on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Prehistoric children as young as three were encouraged by adults to make cave art 13,000 years ago, new research shows. The Cambridge University study sheds new light on the lives of children and the ancient art they made during the prehistoric hunter gatherer period in the French caverns at Rouffignac, known as the Cave of a Hundred Mammoths. While the caverns are famous for their striking drawings of woolly mammoths, bison and horses, the research focused on the thousands of lines made by people running their fingers along the soft clay walls throughout the five mile cavern complex. Cambridge archaeologists were able to identify the age and gender of the children who made the simple ancient art form known as ""finger fluting"" by measuring the width of the flutings and the profile of the middle three fingers. ""We have found marks by children aged between three and seven years old -- and we have been able to identify four individual children by matching up their marks,"" said Cambridge University archaeologist Jess Cooney. ""The most prolific of the children who made flutings was aged around five -- and we are almost certain the child in question was a girl."" The fact that archaeologists didn't find a single place where fluting marks were made by adults alone suggests there were few boundaries between adult and child activities in this prehistoric hunter gatherer culture, according to Cooney. Not only did the adults make art alongside the children, Cooney says the fact that child-sized flutings were found on the ceilings of some cave chambers means adults actively encouraged them to make art, lifting them up to areas they could not reach alone. ""Some of the children's flutings are high up on the walls and on the ceilings, so they must have been held up to make them or have been sitting on someone's shoulders,"" she said. The archaeologists believe one of the caverns is so dominated by children's flutings that it may actually have been a ""special place"" set aside for them by the adults. ""We sometimes think of one chamber as a playpen of sorts, since there are hundreds of children's flutings but only a few made by adults,"" said Cooney. Why people made finger flutings, which also appear in caves in Spain, New Guinea and Australia, is anyone's guess. ""We don't know why people made them. We can make guesses like they were for initiation rituals, for training of some kind, or simply something to do on a rainy day,"" said Cooney. The children weren't simply running their hands mindlessly along the cavern walls, however. Research in 2006 revealed children had made hut-like shapes called tectiforms -- the first known instance of prehistoric children engaging in symbolic figure-making, according to Cooney. Cooney says her research shines a light on an aspect of history that is typically ignored in academia. ""It's important to realize that children played a major role in the development of not only art, but what it means to be human,"" she said.","Prehistoric children as young as three made cave art 13,000 years ago .

"(CNN) -- It will be Shakespeare as nobody has seen it before. Over six weeks next spring, London's Globe Theatre will present all 37 of the Bard's plays in 37 languages, performed by companies from as many countries. Theater groups from the newly independent nation of South Sudan and conflict-torn Afghanistan, as well as the Balkans, China, New Zealand, South Africa, Italy, France, Russia and Belarus will be among those taking part. One play, Love's Labour's Lost, will be performed entirely in British Sign Language (BSL), used by the deaf community, while the Q Brothers from Chicago will stage Othello in hip hop. Tom Bird, festival director for the Globe to Globe event -- which will run from April to June as part of the ""cultural Olympiad"" ahead of the London 2012 Olympics -- told CNN it was the most ambitious project of its kind. Between a third and a half of the plays to be staged had already been adapted into the various languages, but the festival's organizers also traveled widely looking for talented theater groups to create new adaptations. They were ""completely bowled over"" by the enthusiasm shown for the project by countries around the world, he said, and had to make some difficult decisions about who would make the cut. ""The tricky thing is we can't get everyone in, so we thought a little bit about the languages that are spoken in London, like Urdu, Yoruba and Polish,"" Bird said. ""We also looked at countries that have a great long history of performing Shakespeare, like Georgia and Armenia, and finally if there was a very good show, we could take that anyway."" Some of the groups chosen to take part face ""incredible obstacles that no European or Western theater company would have to put up,"" he said. The actors from Afghanistan had been rehearsing in the British Council compound in the capital, Kabul, that was attacked last month, leaving eight people dead and twice as many injured. ""Luckily they weren't there on that day, but it was really a very, very lucky miss,"" Bird said. The Afghan actors cannot currently get visas for Britain in Kabul, so will have to rehearse The Comedy of Errors in India and then travel to London from there, he said. Acting involving both men and women, the latter not always covering their heads, also presents a cultural challenge, he added. The theater company from South Sudan gave its first performance at independence day celebrations this summer, as the new nation emerged from decades of civil conflict. The group will perform William Shakespeare's Cymbeline in Juba Arabic, in what will be ""a great moment in the history of the country,"" Bird said. The three plays of Henry VI, about England's first great civil war of the 15th century, will be staged as a Balkan trilogy by the national theaters of Serbia, Albania and Macedonia, whose actors can draw on the region's recent turbulent past. Globe to Globe's statement points to the Belarus Free Theater -- which will perform King Lear -- as ""the world's bravest theater company"" for its work, ""which it does in spite of the threat of state persecution."" The Palestinian group Ashtar Theater, from Ramallah, will present Richard III in Palestinian Arabic, while the Israeli National Theater company Habima will perform The Merchant of Venice in Hebrew. Bird hopes the range of languages represented will bring a new audience to the Globe, a reproduction of the original Elizabethan theater on the banks of the River Thames in which William Shakespeare himself had a stake. An estimated 60,000 Bangla speakers live in London's inner city Tower Hamlets area, he said -- and the festival organizers hope many will want to see The Tempest performed in that tongue. Some of the 130,000 Brazilians in London could also flock to the Globe to see Romeo and Juliet performed in Brazilian Portuguese by a troupe from Belo Horizonte. As for those theater enthusiasts who don't speak a myriad of languages? They won't find a line-by-line subtitling of each play, Bird said, but a synopsis will be provided so people can follow the gist of what is happening -- and performances will be limited to no more than two-and-a-quarter hours in length. Audiences can also enjoy experiencing performance styles, costumes and music from the four corners of the world. ""We want people to really listen to the language, even if they don't understand it,"" Bird said. ""We hope they will enjoy hearing these familiar stories in an unfamiliar language."" Tickets will be on sale to the public from October 17. The Globe to Globe festival starts April 23, William Shakespeare's birthday.","Shakespeare's plays will be presented in 37 different languages .
Theater companies from all over the world are taking part .
Among them are groups from South Sudan, Afghanistan and the United States .

"(CNN) -- What is usually a time of celebration was marked by gunfire and protests in Syria on Sunday as residents ushered in the first day of the Muslim holiday, Eid al-Adha. Twenty-three people were killed in the violence, activists said. At least 16 were killed in shelling and gunfire in the western city of Homs, a hotbed of anti-government sentiment and a government-led crackdown, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. Three others were killed in Hama, two in Idlib and one person was killed in both Lattakia and Douma, the LCC said. Other people were reported wounded. In Aleppo, Syria's largest city and the country's economic center, residents took to the streets in anti-government protests after the morning Eid prayers, the LCC said. In the southern city of Daraa, where the unrest started in March, security forces fired in the air to disperse crowds and prevent them from demonstrating after prayers, the group said. CNN could not confirm the reports. Tough media restrictions in Syria have made it hard to verify events on the ground. Detainees at Syrian prisons have launched a hunger strike, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, protesting against what they claim were false promises by the Syrian authorities that they would be released. The coordination committees' network added that more than 1,300 detainees at the ""central prison"" in Homs alone were participating. In a statement issued Sunday, the Arab League criticized the Syrian government's failure to implement its proposal ""to end the violence used against protesters,"" and said Arab League foreign ministers would meet Saturday to discuss the situation. The organization has warned that a regional crisis could ensue if the Syrian government does not comply with its pledge last week to follow the Arab League's plan. The government agreed to pull its army off the streets, release people jailed since the protests began in March and allow international journalists and Arab League observers to monitor the moves, Arab League ministers announced Wednesday. But opposition activists say that has not happened, and reports of violence in Syria have continued. On Sunday, Syria's ambassador to the League, Youssef Ahmad, knocked its leaders' comments, according to the government-run Syrian Arab News Agency. ""The AL (Arab League) Secretariat is supposed to play its role in coordinating between the Syrian government and the ministerial committee, not proclaim itself a party against the Syrian government,"" the ambassador said, according to SANA. The news agency also said that Syria's foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, sent letters to his counterparts in various countries, accusing the United States of inciting violence. In a bid to end the unrest, officials have called on Syrians to lay down their weapons -- a request that was discouraged by the United States -- al-Moallem wrote, SANA said. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland was asked last week about a reported amnesty offer that would give Syrians 72 hours to turn themselves in. ""I wouldn't advise anybody to turn themselves in to regime authorities at the moment,"" she said. Eid al-Adha, which commemorates the Muslim prophet Ibraham's willingness to sacrifice his son for Allah, is one of two major holidays in Islam. The other, Eid al-Fitr, marks the end of Ramadan, when Muslims fast from dawn to dusk. In ordinary times, the occasions are marked with joyous community prayers, acts of charity, visits from far-flung relatives, gift-giving and elaborate feasts. But Syria is in the midst of a nearly eight-month uprising that started with calls for elections and an end to abuses by security forces, but turned into widespread calls for the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad. Despite a brutal government crackdown, the demonstrations continue. On Saturday, violence left at least 28 people dead, adding to a death toll that has climbed upward of 3,800, the LCC said. SANA placed Saturday's toll at 22, and said the ""martyrs"" had died at the hands of ""armed terrorist groups"" -- a phrase the state has used to describe the anti-government demonstrators. Al-Assad and other officials have blamed the violence on outside forces attempting to undermine the 40-year rule of the president's family. Syria has made previous pledges to withdraw armed forces from civilian areas, but in some of those cases, it withdrew only armored units and left infantry in place, or returned after a brief pullout. It also has made other moves aimed at defusing the protests, including plans to draft a new constitution, but they have failed to appease demonstrators.

"(CNN) -- Is President Barack Obama running against the GOP or the GDP? In exactly one year -- November 6, 2012 -- we'll be lining up at polling places to cast our votes for the next president. How much of that decision will be determined by economic data and poll numbers? Some of the smartest political pros believe you can gauge a president's chances of re-election by looking at just a couple of key indicators -- job approval, unemployment and growth in gross domestic product. Plug in the data and you get the election outcome -- pure, unsentimental and simple. To test this theory, I compared Obama's standing right now with those of recent past presidents one year before the re-election vote. Here's what I found: . There is no reason for overconfidence at Obama election headquarters -- the man is presiding over a historically bad economy. But his popularity numbers could be worse, and a lot can change in a year. The most important factor is the momentum heading into Election Day -- and yes, the opponent matters. For example, at about 1,000 days into their terms, according to Gallup, Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan had mediocre approval ratings of 49% -- roughly one year out from their landslide 49-state re-elections in 1972 and 1984, respectively. Running against George McGovern and Walter Mondale, two weak candidates, certainly helped their efforts. Bill Clinton was also at 49% approval one year before his 1996 victory over Bob Dole. Obama's 45% approval rating this week is a tick up from his third quarter average of 2011. He's doing better than the two one-term presidents of the 1970s. Gerald Ford was at 44% in the wake of Watergate and desperate promises to ""Whip Inflation Now."" Jimmy Carter was mired in the Iran hostage crisis with a rock-bottom job approval rate of 32%, despite a relatively decent unemployment rate of 5.9%. So here's a reality check: Obama has never been anywhere near that low. The biggest cautionary tale comes from the first President George Bush. He was riding high at 62% one year out from his 1992 loss. But euphoria from victory in the first Gulf War gave way to resentment over a relatively brief recession. Unemployment was about 7% in 1991 -- two points lower than now. GDP growth in the third quarter of 1991 was 1.7%, up from negative 1.9% in the first quarter. The 2.5% GDP growth in the third quarter of 2011 looks pretty good by comparison. But Clinton was able to campaign successfully against Bush over the recession in 1992, despite 4% GDP growth that year. Sometimes the narrative gets so established that it can't be dislodged. The closest unemployment rate to today's 9% was Reagan's 8.5% in 1983 -- but that was down from over 10 percent the previous year. The trend was Reagan's friend -- GDP growth was rocketing at 8 percent in the third quarter of '83 and continued at that clip into early '84 -- all of which made it feel like ""Morning in America."" So where does Obama stand in this hall of presidents? His approval rating is in the murky area between the one- and two-termers, but given the historically high unemployment rate, it's remarkable that his job approval isn't lower. One explanation for this bit of gravity defiance is that Obama's personal approval rating remains quite high -- nearly 70% . But that makes him susceptible to the election-year argument that Mitt Romney is starting to make: Nice guy, good family, but it's time to give someone else a chance to turn the economy around. The economy is finally showing some signs of improving, but it's not happening fast enough to add meaningfully to consumer confidence. And Europe's continued economic instability threatens to tank whatever glimmer of a recovery there is. While unemployment will hopefully continue to decline toward 8% or lower, it's hard to imagine that we'll see the kind of GDP growth that boosted Reagan in 1984 or Clinton in 1996. ""The worst is over"" isn't the most inspirational re-election slogan. Likewise, the recent bump in approval ratings President Obama has enjoyed -- from 41% to 45% -- is nothing to really cheer about at the White House. It is due to three factors that could fade: the vindication of his intervention in Libya (foreign policy is an unexpected bright spot in this administration); the food-fight chaos among the Republican candidates; and, yes, the modestly positive economic data. There's an additional headwind that President Obama faces -- 40% percent of Americans call themselves conservative while just 20% describe themselves as liberal. The landslides of the past 40 years have come from Republicans -- Nixon and Reagan -- while Bill Clinton was the first Democrat re-elected since FDR and never broke 50% of the popular vote, in large part because of Ross Perot's two independent campaigns. It doesn't take a crystal ball -- or reams of data -- to say that the 2012 presidential election is going to be close. By any historical measure Barack Obama is a very vulnerable incumbent. Nonetheless, he has withstood tough economic winds without his popularity completely collapsing and he has the comparative benefit of a weak Republican field. But if a week is a long time in politics (just ask Herman Cain), a year is a lifetime. We are in for a wild election ride, and a long election night one year from today. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: Can one predict presidential chances by GDP growth, approval, jobs?

"Washington (CNN) -- A Maryland man pleaded guilty Tuesday to selling on eBay sound recordings donated to the National Archives, including one of baseball great Babe Ruth. Leslie Waffen, 66, pleaded guilty to embezzling government property. He worked at the National Archives and Records Administration, known as NARA, for more than 40 years and was once the head of the department involving motion picture and sound recordings. According to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Maryland, he engaged in ""an eight-year scheme to sell items on eBay that he stole from the National Archives."" Waffen admitted to selling a December 1937 voice recording of Ruth out hunting for the sum of $34.74 on eBay. That item was recovered by investigators. The plea agreement does not list the additional stolen recordings the government says Waffen sold on eBay. Court documents say agents searched Waffen's home last year and found at least 955 sound recordings belonging to NARA that are worth at least $30,000.

"(CNN) -- Dreaming of a white Christmas? Then you're in for a rude awakening. The only thing white about this riotously multiethnic black comedy is the blizzard of cocaine that flies through the air as Bing Crosby croons his yuletide standard at an out of control Christmas Eve party. If I said the latest sortie from cultural subversives Harold Lee (John Cho) and Kumar Patel (Kal Penn) has something to offend everyone, I'd probably be over-estimating the sensitivities of at least some of the 17.4 million Americans who are estimated to use marijuana at least once a month. Still, I imagine that the running gag about an infant inadvertently exposed to pot, coke and ecstasy might strike some people as pretty near the knuckle. Others will choke when the always game Neil Patrick Harris -- playing himself -- explains his miraculous resurrection with reference to a run-in with Jesus, who didn't take kindly to Harris making out with His groupies. Then there are the gags -- good, bad and indifferent - that deliberately play up ethnic stereotypes: jailbird Latinos, gangsta African-Americans, tight-fisted Jews, bloodthirsty Slavs, square and boring WASPS. The subtler joke being that Harold and Kumar's own ethnicity is invisible -- except to the occasional bigots they encounter. (""Sorry, I don't date black guys,"" says the Ukrainian virgin, Mary, as she rejects Kumar in favor of Korean-American Harold.) You want a plot? It's set six years after the boys escaped from Guantanamo. Harold is now a successful Wall Street executive, married, clean and sober. He's washed his hands of Kumar, who's still a bonafide pothead and no further along in life than he ever was. But the ex-best friends are reunited in a typically quixotic quest to get their hands on a 12-foot Christmas tree before Midnight Mass comes out. Maybe the movie does pander to a certain slacker sexism -- but even that's tempered by an eye-watering item when one of the boys gets stuck to an icy pole, ""A Christmas Story""-style (only it's not his tongue that's stuck). That's male bonding of an especially painful kind -- and marks the natural culmination for a buddy dynamic that's deeply engrained in our movies, from Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Hope and Crosby, Martin and Lewis, Cheech and Chong, and Bill and Ted all the way to ""Dumb & Dumber."" It's a tradition that Cho and Penn sustain with as much charm as circumstances allow. In a week when a French satirical magazine was firebombed for publishing an issue guest-edited by the prophet Mohammed (or so they claimed), there is definitely something to be said for a movie that takes a blowtorch to political correctness and even puts a bullet in the head of old Saint Nick. By offending everyone, the theory goes, no one needs be offended. It's a patchy affair, these things almost always are, but a commendably trim 90-minute running time keeps things hopping. The film hits an early high with a series of inspired gags breaking the fourth wall to poke fun at its own 3D gimmickry. Director Todd Strauss-Schulson throws in a horrific claymation fantasy, doffs his cap at Busby Berkeley and shoots an egg-throwing sequence as if he's John Woo, just because he can. The yolks on us, I guess. At regular intervals he sends clouds of pot wafting towards the audience. You don't need to be an expert in smoke signals to catch the drift: Lighten up, America.","There are the gags that deliberately play up ethnic stereotypes .

"(CNN) -- The massive earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan on Friday spared the island of Indonesia, a nearby developing country that was devastated in 2004 by one of the deadliest tsunamis in history. Helping after that disaster was CNN Hero Robin Lim. Lim is the founder of Indonesia's Yayasan Bumi Sehat health clinics, which provide free prenatal and birthing care to women in need. Lim recently spoke with CNN's Ebonne Ruffins about how her midwife teams respond in natural disasters, balancing critical medical needs with cultural traditions. Ebonne Ruffins: What's it like to work in Indonesia and, specifically, after the 2004 tsunami? Robin Lim: In Indonesia, there is a great need for us because many mothers want the help of professional birth attendants but can't afford them. So they come to us. It was not easy to start so grass-roots in Bali, completely reliant on donations, but we did it. And when the tsunami happened a few years later in Aceh, we were early responders. So many on the eastern coast lost everything, and it was very difficult to witness. But we had to be there for those who survived or were fighting to survive. Ruffins: How do your teams provide maternal and infant care in the middle of a devastated area? Lim: Because the devastation can ruin entire clinics and resources, we have to be prepared to treat them with limited materials. Instead of cutting the umbilical cord, for instance, we burn it -- especially in disaster zones, because it's something we can teach our midwives and doctors who've lost their instruments. Using scissors to sever the umbilical cord carries a risk of tetanus. If you burn the cord, there's just no risk of infection. And outside of just knowing how to safely respond medically, we try to have respect for everyone's faith. We don't have any particular religion, and we'll honor all requests and faith traditions -- special songs, flowers or chants. No matter what they are or where we are, we honor these faiths. This helps the moms feel safe and supported with us. Video: Watch a cord-burning ceremony at Lim's clinic . Ruffins: You've delivered enough babies to repopulate another island. Have you learned anything from the people you've helped? Lim: I've learned a lot. Quite often I cry tears of joy because I feel humbled. Once in a while, a baby is born that doesn't breathe. Normally CPR works, but sometimes no matter what you do, that baby just wasn't meant to make it. That really humbles us, because we have control over reducing risks for the mothers and babies but I have learned we don't have control over fate. There are so many more good days than bad, though. When there is a long night and there is an emergency, the mothers just hang in there -- and the babies, too. They are so strong, and they push through -- literally. That's love. They have taught me that this world is really worth preserving. The babies come in so fresh and innocent, trusting and open to love. And if we can just give them a safe and gentle entrance into this world, then they will keep that ability to love and trust.

"(CNN) -- Amnesty International is demanding the United States stop allowing the export of arms and riot-control material to Egypt, where security forces have cracked down on protests. ""U.S. arms shipments to Egypt's security forces must be stopped until there is certainty that tear gas and other munitions, weaponry or other equipment aren't linked to bloodshed on Egyptian streets,"" Amnesty's Brian Wood, who monitors conventional weapons and arms control, said Wednesday. An American company shipped supplies that feature chemical irritants and riot control agents, Amnesty International said in its statement, with arrival on November 26. The organization said another shipment in August had the ""product code of bullets, cartridges and shells, but the latter was also described as 'ammunition smoke,'"" which Amnesty said includes tear gas. It cited three shipments since the revolution that toppled President Hosni Mubarak in February. Amnesty called on Egyptian security forces, including riot police, to be trained in the use of force and firearms. Mark Toner, State Department deputy spokesman, told reporters Wednesday, ""We've condemned the use of excessive force against protesters during the recent period of civil unrest in Cairo. We do take allegations of misuse of tear gas very seriously."" He said an ongoing export license has recently expired, but a shipment of tear gas was delivered to Egypt last week. ""But beyond that, there are no additional shipments that we're aware of and no additional licenses that we're aware of."" The department is monitoring the security situation in Egypt, Toner said. Protesters have been upset at the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which has ruled Egypt since Mubarak was forced from office. On the front lines of a street battle in Cairo in late November, protesters took turns hurling stones at helmeted riot police. Every few minutes, the police fired canisters of tear gas back at the demonstrators. As journalists walked through the melee, demonstrators ran up wielding spent shotgun shells and tear gas canisters. One of the tear gas canisters had markings clearly identifying it as having been manufactured in Jamestown, Pennsylvania. ""Made in USA, made in USA,"" several of the young men yelled. CNN's Ivan Watson contributed to this report.","Rights group wants to ensure the material is not linked to ""bloodshed"" in Egypt .

"London (CNN) -- Three top Pakistani cricketers were jailed Thursday after being convicted of plotting to cheat and to take bribes in a match against England last summer, in a scandal that rocked the international sport. Former national team captain Salman Butt was sentenced to 30 months and bowler Mohammad Asif to a year in prison after they were found guilty by a London court Tuesday. Fellow bowler Mohammad Amir, a rising star in the sport at the age of 19, was given a six-month jail term, having pleaded guilty. A fourth man, London-based businessman Mazhar Majeed, was jailed for two years and eight months for his role as an agent who arranged the betting scam. He had also pleaded guilty. All will serve half of their sentences before being eligible for parole. The Pakistanis were accused of spot fixing, or rigging parts of a test match. The trial and sentencing have been closely watched in Pakistan, where cricket is a hugely popular sport. The Pakistan Cricket Board, the sport's national governing body, said the trio's conviction and sentencing was ""a sad day for Pakistan cricket."" Spokesman Nadeem Sarwar said in a statement: ""Instead of having pride in playing for their country, these players chose to disappoint their supporters, damage the image of their country and bring the noble game of cricket into disrepute. There is little sympathy in Pakistan for the sorry pass they have come to."" He said the board was determined to stamp out corrupt behavior within cricket and will introduce measures to do that. These include better training in the game's rules and ethics for players, alongside stricter monitoring, a strengthened code of conduct for agents and others involved in the game and a recommendation to the government to pass a law making corruption in sport a criminal offense. Imran Khan, former cricketer turned politician, told domestic channel Geo TV after the sentencing: ""For Pakistan and for Pakistani cricket this is extremely detrimental. ""This will bring shame to our country and the families of the cricketers. I can't imagine what the family is going through. Right now this is bad for all of us."" He said he felt special sympathy for Amir, the youngest, who had probably gotten involved after seeing the others getting away with match fixing. Asif's father also appeared on Geo TV, saying: ""Jails are made for men, so what if my son is sent there."" He accused unspecified foreign governments of being behind his son's conviction, but he said the family would not starve as a result. Butt's sister, Rubab Butt, also told reporters her brother was innocent. ""My brother didn't do anything wrong,"" she said. ""There has been no evidence presented to us about his guilt and the decision was wrong, we disagree with it. My brother is innocent."" Butt and Asif had denied the charges. Before the sentencing, Amir expressed remorse in a statement read by his lawyer. ""First I want to apologize to Pakistan and to everyone that cricket is important to,"" he said. ""I do know how much damage this has done to the game, a game which I love more than anything else in the world. ""I did decide many months ago that I wanted to admit that I deliberately threw two no-balls (fouls) at the Lord's Test last summer. But I know this was very late, and I want to apologize for not saying it before. I didn't find the courage to do it at the beginning, and I know very well that made everything much more difficult."" The Pakistanis are among the lowest-paid of the main cricket nations, partly due to the loss of much-needed revenue from hosting tours. International teams have turned down offers to play in Pakistan after a 2009 terrorist attack on the touring Sri Lankan team in Lahore. CNN's Phil Black and Andrew Carey and journalists Shaan Khan and Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","The Pakistan Cricket Board says it is a sad day for the game in Pakistan .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- ""Now, come, travel back in time. See where and how these rulers lived,"" Harrison Ford's deep voice beckons just before double doors swing open into a labyrinth of galleries displaying more than 130 ancient Egyptian artifacts. This canopic stopper covered one of the openings of a container that held King Tutankhamun's internal organs. The recorded introduction a la ""Indiana Jones"" welcomes visitors to a new exhibit featuring treasures from boy king Tutankhamun's tomb and artifacts tied to rulers spanning 2,000 years of Egyptian history. ""Tutankhamun: The Golden King and the Great Pharaohs,"" presented by Emory University's Michael C. Carlos Museum, premieres in the United States on November 15 at the Atlanta Civic Center. An array of objects associated with rulers dating from Egypt's Fourth Dynasty into the Late Period (about 2600 B.C. to 660 B.C.) makes this the largest and most encyclopedic exhibit featuring Egyptian pharaohs presented in the U.S., according to exhibition curator David Silverman, who has worked on other exhibits focusing on Tutankhamun. ""A lot of people, when they hear 'Tut,' they think of gold, they think of the mummy, and they think of the discovery -- all of which is important. But when you think of more than 300 pharaohs, 31 dynasties, [Tutankhamun's] is only one of them,"" Silverman said.  Listen to Silverman describe the ancient burial process and artifacts found in King Tut's tomb » . Carefully focused pools of light illuminate stone pharaohs, gold and carnelian jewels and objects intended for the afterlife in darkened galleries looking at themes including the family life, religion, court and gold of the rulers. A golden mask found on the mummy of Psusennes I presides over the gold gallery. Considered by ancient Egyptians to be the skin of the gods, gold was highly prized and used extensively in royal burial to assure pharaohs' divinity in the afterlife. A gold collar found on the body of Neferuptah, daughter of Amenemhat III, showcases an intricate arc of carnelian and feldspar that terminates with golden falcon heads.  Tour the galleries with exhibition curators » . Four rooms at the end of the exhibit correspond with the four chambers of King Tutankhamun's tomb. He was one of the last rulers of the 18th Dynasty; his rule started in 1333 B.C. when he was only 9 or 10 years old and ended in 1323 B.C. when he died under mysterious circumstances. A tented entry, larger-than-life photos of archaeologist Howard Carter and his financial backer, Lord Carnarvon, and photos of the archaeological dig that revealed the tomb set the scene for some of the riches discovered by Carter in 1922. One of four coffinettes that each held one of the king's internal organs is among the lavish burial ornaments on display. Statuettes of servants also were found in the tomb, placed there to ensure that the king would do no forced labor in the afterlife. Ancient ritual and modern technology collide in the final gallery, where visitors can see CT scans of Tutankhamun's mummy, part of an Egyptian research project in collaboration with National Geographic that will scan all of the ancient mummies. The scans of the boy king, long suspected to have been murdered, show no signs of foul play. A suspicious dark spot on the back of the skull was revealed to be a result of the embalming process, Silverman said. Other recent discoveries? ""Unlike any of the representations that we see of Tut, these scans show that he had a recessed chin and a rather pronounced overbite,"" Silverman said. After its conclusion in Atlanta in May, ""Tutankhamun: The Golden King and the Great Pharaohs"" will open at the end of June in Indiana at the Children's Museum of Indianapolis.

"(Financial Times) -- While most consumer goods companies are seeking opportunities in China, domestic condom maker Safedom is going in the opposite direction -- seeking European partners or acquisitions as part of a bid to go global. The company, majority-owned by its founder, has grown rapidly in its short life. It will sell 200m condoms this year, all within China, and is targeting sales of 1bn next year; the same number that Durex, the world's biggest player, was producing in the country within three years. Brian Fu, chief executive, was in the UK last week ""meeting potential partners and acquisitions"". Funding for any deal will either come from existing shareholders, bank loans or possibly through an overseas stock market listing, he said. Despite the size of the market on its own doorstep -- and added attraction of a government-mandated one-child policy -- Safedom sees its future on the international stage. It reckons its virus-proof latex condoms will enable it to compete alongside the global players such as Durex, now part of Reckitt Benckiser, and Ansell of Australia. However, Mr Fu said that the strength of his company -- whose range includes Beautiful Girl, Take Me and Green Lemon -- was in manufacturing and technology, and going global required bringing in branding and marketing expertise. Sales outlets and channels are also likely to vary from China, where half of all condoms are bought by women. ""We think we have good leading edge technology and a good management team. What we lack is the branding part: we are not well known,"" Mr Fu said. According to Global Industry Analysts, the data publishers, the global condom market is set to hit 27bn units, worth $6bn, by 2015, driven by demand from emerging economies including China and Africa. Safedom plans to start selling in Bangladesh and countries in Africa shortly. But in China, as with other consumer goods ranging from cars to handbags, the stress is on bling. At the opulent Venetian casino in Macao, Safedom sells single condoms for HK$50 (US$6) a throw and, according to Mr Fu, designer condoms (presumably fake) are available online at US$65 apiece. So far, roughly one-quarter of the group's sales have been to the government, which distributes them free of charge, but that proportion is expected to shrink. ""In the old days free condoms were welcomed by the people,"" said Shuyu Xu, director of international sales. ""But now people can afford to pay and will go to the pharmacy to buy the best, most fancy ones."" © The Financial Times Limited 2011 .","China condom maker Safedom is looking to go global, aiming at industry giant Durex .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic has had a phenomenal 2011, but his exertions appear to be taking their toll. Injuries are threatening to derail the world No. 1's hopes of finishing the tennis season on a high note. Djokovic suffered just his fourth defeat in 71 matches this year on Saturday, losing 2-6 7-6 (7-4) 6-0 to Japan's rising star Kei Nishikori in the semifinals of the Swiss Indoors event. The Serbian has won three out of four grand slam titles this season, but is battling to be fit for the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals after a recurring shoulder problem hampered him in Basel. Djokovic, the champion here in 2009 and runner-up last year, said he would travel to France for next week's penultimate event, the Paris Masters, despite his fitness worries. ""I don't think I'll be able to train for the next few days. I could barely serve for much of the match, I was in pain,"" the 24-year-old told reporters after losing a set 6-0 for just the sixth time in his career. Has men's tennis reached burn-out? ""My shoulder is very bad, we won't even talk about the third set. I have a lot of pain in my body from the competition this week. I hope I can be ready for Paris."" Djokovic returned to action in Switzerland after six weeks out with a back injury suffered during his epic U.S. Open final against Rafael Nadal, an ailment which left him unable to guide Serbia into a second successive Davis Cup final. ""It was a shock to the body. Competition is different to practice. I may have forced things too much,"" he said. ""I was feeling afraid of the shoulder and what might happen to it. My rhythm on my serve has been completely off."" World No. 32 Nishikori made history by becoming the first Japanese player to beat a top-ranked opponent. The 21-year-old, a wild-card entry after reaching the Shanghai Masters semis, will play defending champion Roger Federer in Sunday's final as he seeks his second ATP Tour title -- the first came in 2008. Third seed Federer has won four of his 67 career titles in his hometown event, where he has now won 42 out of 49 matches. The 16-time grand slam champion defeated compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka 7-6 (7-5) 6-2 on Saturday -- his 10th win in their 11 meetings -- to reach the final for the sixth year in a row. Apart from his 2009 defeat by Djokovic, Federer also lost in the 2000 and 2001 finals. Juan Martin del Potro's hopes of reaching the eight-man season finale suffered a blow on Saturday when the Argentine lost in the semifinals of the Valencia Open hard-court event. The sixth seed could have moved up to ninth in the rankings with victory, and was in good form having not dropped a set all week, but was surprisingly beaten 6-4 7-6 (7-4) by last year's runner-up Marcel Granollers. The result means that Tomas Berdych became the sixth player to qualify for the event, the second year in a row the Czech has done so. World No. 34 Granollers reached his fourth career final, having won two titles on clay. He will next face Argentine wildcard entry Juan Monaco, who upset defending champion David Ferrer -- beating Granollers' fellow Spaniard 7-5 1-6 6-3. Ferrer has already qualified for the London showpiece later this month.","World No. 1 Novak Djokovic beaten by Kei Nishikori in Swiss semifinals .

"(CNN) -- ""George Washington slept here."" It was once an American catchphrase -- cheery shorthand for a blithesome fact of American democracy: Our presidents come from among us, and have traditionally striven to continue moving among us. Any number of country inns and lodges, in the early years of the United States, proudly proclaimed that the first president once spent the night within their walls. The phrase had staying power; as late as the 1940s a hit Broadway comedy by Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman was titled ""George Washington Slept Here,"" and was followed by a major motion picture starring Jack Benny. It is doubtful, in our contemporary era of Code Red security levels and constant threats against public officials, that there will be a sequel to the jolly play or movie coming out any time soon. Our presidents still, from time to time, sleep among us, but whatever feeling of lighthearted happenstance was implicit in the ""George Washington slept here"" slogan is long gone. By necessity, a president spending a night away from the White House is grimly serious business. Without having planned it that way, I ended up staying at the same hotel as President Barack Obama during his recent visit to New York to address a session of the United Nations General Assembly. I had scheduled a trip to New York months before, and had no idea the president would be in town at the same time. The roadway congestion and police-mandated detours on the way into midtown Manhattan from LaGuardia created a backed-up mess, and the cabdriver summed it up in a weary phrase I could tell he had used many times that week: ""Obama traffic."" It's not a phrase any politician would welcome -- no one seeking the voting public's goodwill wants to be associated with traffic headaches -- but that's how it is these days, whether the person in office is a Democrat or a Republican. When a president comes to town, all streets along the paths of his motorcades are blocked off, all people seeking access to where he is are frisked, either electronically or by hand or both. Because of the history of violence against political leaders, the melancholy assumption on the part of law enforcement is that everyone must be presumed guilty of having bad intentions until being deemed innocent. No one has to ask why there must be Secret Service war wagons standing sentry on otherwise cleared-of-traffic streets adjacent to where a president sleeps, or why guests checking into a hotel where a president stays have their baggage taken from them and carted to an outdoor location behind steel-and-cement barriers, where sophisticated screening devices give them the once or twice over. And no one has to inquire about the reason for the searches every hotel employee and every hotel guest must submit to each time he or she wants to enter the building anew. Not to have these measures in place would be to invite disaster of shattering proportions, especially when, in the case of the recent United Nations sessions, not only the president of the United States, but numerous top-level foreign officials are there, too. Still, it makes the very idea of a president mixing with the people he is elected to serve seem like a well-intentioned but ultimately bittersweet illusion. And the limitations on a president's movement, and on the free movement of citizens who would like to catch a glimpse of him, are destined to grow ever more restrictive. Presidents routinely rode through cities in open convertibles-- until the murder of John F. Kennedy made that seem like a foolhardy concept. Presidents and presidential candidates took it for granted that the people who worked in the buildings where they spoke or slept were not a major danger-- until Robert F. Kennedy took that shortcut through the hotel kitchen. Presidents felt relatively safe strolling onto a sidewalk with unscreened people in close proximity -- until Ronald Reagan walked onto the wrong sidewalk on the wrong day. Today, when presidents decide to take a jog or go out for a bite to eat, it is done from within thick concentric rings of armed Secret Service agents and local police. Presidents have been known to say that they feel stifled governing from the environs of the Rose Garden, meaning that they believe they have to get out from the bubble that is life in the White House if they want to maintain a feel for America and Americans. Yet the reality, increasingly, is that they can't and don't leave the bubble -- the bubble moves right along with them, except that it is no longer merely a bubble, it is a heavily fortified multiple-city-block mobile bunker. And every time that bunker is deployed into the nation beyond Washington is a new reminder of the seemingly unsolvable quandary we face: . We wish we didn't live in a world where such measures are necessary. Our presidents wish they didn't live in a world where such measures are necessary. It's not our fault, or theirs. But it's not going to get any easier. Wherever George Washington may have slept, if he were alive today the place would be surrounded by iron barricades, shut-down roadways and government sharpshooters bearing automatic weapons. It's the kind of thing that might keep a president awake at night. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Slogan ""George Washington slept here"" implied man-of-the-people event .

"Beijing (CNN) -- China's Foreign Ministry weighed in on the widespread anxiety over Iran's nuclear program on Friday, urging Iran to be flexible with the U.N. nuclear agency but staunchly deploring force amid talk of strikes against the country. Hong Lei, the ministry spokesman, made the comments, state-run news agency Xinhua said on Friday. They come ahead of a report on Iran's nuclear program expected to be released next week by the International Atomic Energy Agency. ""As a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iran should fulfill the relevant international obligations,"" Hong told reporters. The report is expected to focus specifically on research and development that Tehran may have carried out that would help it build a nuclear warhead. Iran said it is developing nuclear power for peaceful purposes but Western powers have long asserted that Iran aspires to build nuclear weapons. In recent days, there has been widespread talk in the Israeli media about the possibility of military strikes on Iran. The daily newspaper Haaretz reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was lobbying members of his Cabinet to back a military strike against Iran. On that same day, the Israeli military tested a new rocket propulsion system. Britain's Guardian daily newspaper said that country's armed forces ""are stepping up their contingency planning for potential military action against Iran amid mounting concern about Tehran's nuclear enrichment programme."" It reported that the Defence Ministry thinks the United States ""may decide to fast-forward plans for targeted missile strikes at some key Iranian facilities. British officials say that if Washington presses ahead it will seek, and receive, UK military help for any mission, despite some deep reservations within the coalition government."" China's stance is an important element in the diplomatic focus on the nuclear issue because of China's permanent U.N. Security Council membership. Even though China has supported some sanctions on Iran over the years, Beijing and Russia have not been as hard-line toward the Islamic republic as the other members of the Security Council -- the United States, Britain and France. Hong said disagreements with Iran should be resolved through ""dialogue and cooperation,"" Xinhua reported. ""The IAEA should positively clarify relevant problems by cooperating with Iran in an impartial and objective manner"" and ""Iran should be flexible and sincere when cooperating with the IAEA,"" Xinhua reported, citing Hong. China warns against the use of force but will promote ""dialogue and cooperation and play a constructive role"" in dealing with the Iranian nuclear issue. ""It is extremely important to avoid new turmoil in the Middle East"" and ""a peaceful settlement is the common benefit for both the Middle East and international society,"" Hong said, according to Xinhua.","Talk of force against Iran surfaces in the media .

"(CNN) -- The Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, who helped lead the civil rights movement, has died, the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute said Wednesday. He was 89. Shuttlesworth is among the iconic figures honored in the International Civil Rights Walk of Fame at the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site in Atlanta. King once called Shuttlesworth ""the most courageous civil rights fighter in the South."" President Barack Obama issued a statement honoring Shuttleworth, saying he ""dedicated his life to advancing the cause of justice for all Americans. He was a testament to the strength of the human spirit. And today we stand on his shoulders, and the shoulders of all those who marched and sat and lifted their voices to help perfect our union. ... ""America owes Reverend Shuttlesworth a debt of gratitude, and our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Sephira, and their family, friends and loved ones."" When the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against segregated busing in Montgomery, Alabama, Shuttlesworth rallied the membership of a group he established in May 1956 -- the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights -- to challenge the practice of segregated busing in Birmingham. Shuttlesworth also helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, with King and other civil rights leaders. Shuttlesworth's efforts weren't without a price: his home was bombed on Christmas Day in 1956, but he and his family were not injured. He was, however, hurt in 1957 when he was beaten with chains and whips as he sought to integrate an all-white public school. That same year, Shuttlesworth helped King organize the SCLC, serving as the organization's first secretary from 1958 to 1970. He later served briefly as its president in 2004. In 2001, President Bill Clinton awarded Shuttlesworth a Presidential Citizens Medal -- the nation's second-highest civilian award -- for his leadership in the ""non-violent civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s, leading efforts to integrate Birmingham, Alabama's schools, buses and recreational facilities"" and helping found the SCLC. Shuttlesworth also protested segregated lunch counters and helped lead sit-ins at the eateries in 1960. He participated in organizing the Freedom Rides against segregated interstate buses in the South when he joined forces with the Congress On Racial Equality. In 1963, he was injured again when a fire hose was turned on him during a protest against segregation in Birmingham. The blast of water, directed against demonstrators by order of Birmingham Commissioner of Public Safety Bull Connor, slammed Shuttlesworth against a wall. He was hospitalized but recovered. He was also a principal in the historic march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965, which he helped organize. In the early 1960s, he moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he fought homelessness and continued the movement against racism. There, he founded and served as pastor of the Greater New Light Baptist Church from 1966 to 2006. In the 1980s, he established the Shuttlesworth Housing Foundation in Cincinnati, which provided grants to help low-income families buy homes. The Ohio Civil Rights Commission has placed Shuttlesworth in its Hall of Fame. CNN's Tenisha Bell contributed to this report.","The Rev.

"HONG KONG (CNN) -- He's a three-time former champion and darling of the Roland Garros crowd, but this week Gustavo ""Guga"" Kuerten took to the clay in Paris for the final time. Tennis great Gustavo Kuerten will retire after his appearance at this year's French Open. He won the French Open as a virtual unknown in 1997, repeating his triumph in 2000 and 2001. The former world number one has suffered injuries and heartache during his 13-year career on the tour, and will be hanging up his racket after this event. Prior to going out in the first round to Paul-Henri Mathieu he told CNN about his Parisian love affair. CNN: How does it feel to be going into the tournament you've won three times as the World number 1,140, and it being the last tournament you'll ever play? GK: Actually the ranking doesn't matter for me. When I decided to take this farewell tour I wasn't looking for ranking points. I wanted to have the feelings that I had in the most special places for me, to enjoy them one last time, to see the people and the public. Today it's still very hard for me to think that in a week, five days, it will be over. I try not to think about it too much. I have worked so hard the past three weeks to be in good shape to play at least one good match, that my mind is totally focused on the tournament, as if I were still competing, like in the past years. I arrived in Paris, and like every year I immediately went to Roland Garros and practiced on center court. It feels like it is a normal year, but there's something different. CNN: What does the French Open mean to you? GK: It means everything. It is here that everything happened to me. I have a love relationship with this tournament, since the first time I came here and over the years I think everything came together, the tournament, the fans and I, all having this love affair. I have so much respect for the tournament. For me it is the most important tournament in the world. All these years on the tour, I always worked out my schedule towards Roland Garros. CNN: What are your favorite memories of Roland Garros? GK: It is very hard to pick just one, because everywhere I go here I have memories, even going back to the junior years. If I had to pick one match though, it would be the one against Michael Russell, in the 4th round in 2001, when I drew the heart [on the court] for the first time. It was just an amazing feeling. After I won the match I felt like I was floating, a feeling that is very, very hard to find. CNN: How does the event compare to the other Grand Slam tournaments? What makes it unique? GK: For me I can't even compare. Everybody asked me over the years if I wanted to win Wimbledon, the U.S. Open or Australian Open... Of course you want to win, but I would rather have won even more Roland Garros than these other Grand Slams. I think it is a combination of it being in Paris, being played on clay, the people and the courts. Even the clay in Roland Garros I think is unique; it is different from any other clay court in the world. CNN: What do the crowds in Paris mean to you? Will you draw another heart in the clay when you finally leave the court? GK: I am not a guy who plans these things ahead. I like things to come naturally. Even when I drew the heart, it was something spontaneous and it ended up being something very special, that showed all the love I have for the tournament and the crowd. I know they are expecting me to speak some French, so I am trying to practice a little this week, but I don't really know... Let's see how it goes. CNN: What else would you have like to have achieved in tennis? GK: I couldn't ask for anything else. I have achieved much more than I could ever expect. Even in my wildest dreams I couldn't imagine that I would win Roland Garros three times, win the Masters Cup and become the number one tennis player in the world... CNN: You're a national hero in Brazil. How does it feel to go back home? GK: I love being in Brazil. Many people asked me why I didn't buy a house in Monaco, or somewhere else, but I never wanted to live outside Brazil. I come from an island, a small city in the south of Brazil and people are used to seeing me there. Of course when I go to bigger cities, I stop for autographs, pictures, sometimes there is a crowd, but it's OK, it's satisfying. In the beginning I didn't really feel like an idol, but I learnt to deal with it and I feel proud to be an example and that people feel inspired by me. CNN: What will you miss most from giving up tennis? GK: Ah, the competition for sure... I am a very competitive guy. The one thing I won't miss though is all the traveling. CNN: What happens when the tennis stops? GK: First I want to take a couple of months off, just to relax, surf and think what I want to do. But I definitely want to be involved with tennis, help develop tennis in Brazil and do more work for my institute, the Instituto Guga Kuerten.

"(CNN) -- Lighthouse keeper J.A. Eckerman was the last person to see World War II Soviet submarine S-2 before it sank in January 1940 between Sweden and Finland. A team of Swedish and Finnish divers had been searching for the Soviet submarine S-2 since 1999. As the submarine dove near the island of Market, northwest of Aland, Eckerman heard a loud explosion and saw smoke rise from the water. The long-lost wreck was missing for 69 years until a team of Swedish and Finnish divers -- including Eckerman's grandson Ingvald -- discovered it this year. What remains of the sub was found between the Swedish coast and the Finnish island of Aland, northeast of Stockholm, in late February, the divers announced Tuesday. The submarine was very badly damaged by the explosion, said Marten Zetterstrom, one of the divers. The front gun is still there, and a torpedo is still in one of the tubes, but about 20 meters (about 65 feet) of the vessel is missing. The search had been going on for nearly 10 years, the divers said in a news release. The sub had a crew of 46 and four passengers when it sank. Sweden and Finland claim credit for sinking the submarine with mines. Russia has contacted Swedish and Finnish authorities to clarify what caused the submarine to sink, the divers said. Finland was at war with the Soviet Union at the time the sub sank. A deal between Germany and the Soviets had put the Nordic nation within the Soviet ""sphere of influence,"" and Soviet troops had invaded Finland late in 1939. The fighting was mostly confined to Finland's eastern border. Just two months after the submarine's sinking, a temporary peace agreement was reached. Sweden remained neutral in World War II. CNN's Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","Lighthouse watchman last saw it 69 years ago before it sank near island of Market .

"(CNN) -- It took more than five years to build, but since its opening last year, the Guangzhou Opera House has become the jewel among the sprawling Chinese megacity's bland urban landscape. Designed by British architect Zaha Hadid it looks more cosmic than communist, but Hadid has likened it to two rocks washed up from the Pearl River and deposited on its bank. From the smoothed corners of its asymmetrical exterior to the undulating 1,800-seat main theater, the concept of fluidity, like the flowing river nearby, goes from inside to out. ""I was very preoccupied at the time with things moving,"" said Hadid. ""That led to the drawings, and the drawings kind of led to distortion and deformation, and then the next influence was really landscape."" The building has gained plaudits from around the world and won the best cultural building award at the 2011 RIBA International Awards. The judges complimented the building on its internal places and external forms as well as how the asymmetry of the auditorium did not detract from the near perfect acoustics. In a career spanning three decades, Hadid has built a reputation for designing seemingly unbuildable structures and the opera house's construction explored new areas for both architect and builders. Essential for much of the design was keeping the building in harmony with the local topography and using natural materials to counter the subtropical climate. The exterior envelop of the buildings combine granite and glazing, with windows angled towards the ground to minimize heat from the sun. The granite cladding -- kept 50 centimeters away from the building -- is also in place to absorb heat and ensure that the interior of the building remains cool without excessive use of air-conditioning systems. Water from the Pearl River is also used directly in the building's cooling systems. When the opera house opened reports suggested that Guangzhou's humid climate and sub-standard construction led to problems with some of the granite slabs and glazing. The Guangzhou construction group that was contracted to build the opera house told the UK's Daily Telegraph that cracks stemmed from ""normal shrinkage"" and any problems since opening were only because of the unexpected complexity of the project and design. A spokesperson for Zaha Hadid Architects admitted that some ""superficial elements"" needed adjustment post-opening, but they have since been addressed. Despite teething problems, the opera house has transformed a once moribund area of the city into the site of one of the world's leading architectural icons.","Opera House was designed by Pritzker Prize winner, Zaha Hadid .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- When director Antoine Fuqua rolls into a community to shoot a movie, he becomes part of that community. Filmmaker Antoine Fuqua began a program to foster young moviemakers in poor communities. This isn't the case of a Hollywood filmmaker cherry-picking glamorous locations like Beverly Hills or Manhattan. Fuqua's interests lie a few miles away, in the grittier section of town. For his 2001 blockbuster, ""Training Day,"" he took stars Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke and shot in South-Central Los Angeles -- deep in the 'hood. And last year, the housing projects in Brooklyn's Brownsville district were key to his latest feature, ""Brooklyn's Finest."" Hawke stars once again, this time alongside Richard Gere, Don Cheadle and Wesley Snipes. Although Fuqua carries himself with the confident ease of someone who enjoys a certain stature in the industry, he's at home in the projects. And he should be. He was raised in a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, public housing complex, and hasn't forgotten what it's like to dream about making it out of the ghetto. Yet now that he's out, he wants back in.  Watch more about how Fuqua mentors young filmmakers » . During the filming of ""Brooklyn's Finest,"" he initiated the non-profit Fuqua Film Program -- an intense, 12-week moviemaking course eligible to young adults from Brownsville, ages 16 to 20. Last year, three students got the chance to write, direct and edit their own short film. This year, he hopes to expand the program to 10 to 15 students. Down the road, he's looking to bring the project to his native Pittsburgh, then roll out to other urban areas. After all, in Hollywood, it's all about who you know -- and Fuqua wants to give neighborhood kids the opportunity to know him. The following is an edited version of an interview CNN did with Fuqua. CNN: What was so compelling about the kids you chose to participate in the Fuqua Film Program? Antoine Fuqua: We selected three kids -- four kids, actually (one could not complete the program because he was sent to Juvenile Hall). ... The concept was to have them write an essay to find out which ones really had the passion for filmmaking. Most of the applicants were 18, 19 years old. Some lost their parents when they were 13, 12, 10. A few were involved in gangs -- or someone in their family is involved in gangs. A young lady just wanted to find a way out of living in the projects, and she wanted to go to college. So it was a number of things I found compelling, but most of all, they all had a little bit of light and a little bit of hope in each letter. CNN: When you handed the participants their video camera, you talked about ""No excuses."" Fuqua: Right. ""No excuses."" Exactly. That concept came from my parents and my grandmother -- the idea that you can't make excuses for things you don't have. You just have to go get 'em. ... If they go after it -- as they did with the essays -- someone's going to hand you a tool and say, ""Here you go. Now what?"" And then it's up to you to prove that you have what it takes. CNN: You've got the teens who are part of the program, and then you have a bunch of little kids (from the neighborhood) who were interested in what was going on, too -- the next generation. Fuqua: (Laughs) The next generation, yeah. They kind of took over the director's chair. I was over directing the actors, and I happened to turn around, and I just saw all these kids all around my monitor, and I said, ""Well, sit down, go ahead. Put the headsets on. You know, if you're going to be here, you can listen and hear what's going on."" And they loved it. I'd see them smiling, and laughing, and every time I yelled, ""Cut!"" they were clapping. And then a few of them would yell, ""Cut!"" and ""Action!"" I like to just go in there and say, ""This is all happening in your neighborhood, these two, three hundred crew members -- black, white, every other color."" You know, a crew is like a United Nations. It's an immediate opportunity to meet and greet people other than the ones you see every day in your community. We're there at four or five in the morning. We leave whenever we finish, which is normally in the middle of the night sometimes. So they see that dedication and that work ethic, and they see how we all get along and how we all have to communicate. And somewhere, I believe, it affects their behavior and how they deal with their lives. CNN: Did anybody do this for you? Fuqua: I'm just like them. I come from the projects in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the Hill District, so I know what it feels like to walk into these concrete buildings (the housing projects) and think that's the world. My goal is to show them that's nothing -- that's a blip in the world. ... Several people gave me opportunities. Mario Van Peebles was doing a little film in Pittsburgh and I was just a little kid running around, and I got to meet him. He was acting in it, and he was really nice and said hello to everybody. It wasn't a situation where they said, ""Go away! You can't be part of this."" CNN: On the set of ""Brooklyn's Finest,"" Denzel Washington spent time talking to the kids. Fuqua: Yeah, Denzel was giving them the real talking. ... He's involved with the Boys and Girls Club, and he does a lot quietly -- people don't even know. When I shot ""Training Day,"" he was, ""Absolutely you've got to shoot down there [in South-Central] -- where else you gonna shoot it?!"" And I remember one day down on the set with Denzel, I was filming and I couldn't find him, and I looked up on the porch, and he was up there on the porch with all these older women, and they were cooking for him, and all the young kids were around, and he was just hanging out where all the people were. And that told me right away what kind of person he was. I don't know how many times he was in his trailer. He was always with the kids -- him and Ethan (Hawke, his co-star) -- hanging out with everyone. And that influenced me a lot because I realized by watching the effect they had on these kids. CNN: What's been the most gratifying part of being involved in the community, and picking the kids for the Fuqua Film Program? Fuqua: I'm satisfied when I hear them talking about wanting to go to Europe, or curious of who Caravaggio is -- the painter -- or tell me they saw a Kurosawa film last night, and they never saw him before. You know, it's like the world is starting to open up -- their eyes are opening up. Maybe one of those kids is going to be the next Steven Spielberg, or the next Denzel, or who knows -- the next Antoine.","Antoine Fuqua started program for young filmmakers .

"(CNN) -- We are ... Penn State. I cannot recount the thousands of times that I have proudly proclaimed that chant throughout the years. I belted it out as a Penn State cheerleader, later as a proud alum standing in Beaver Stadium among nearly 100,000 raucous fans, and more recently on Saturday afternoons sitting solo in my TV room watching my Nittany Lions roar in those classic no-name jerseys. Those words still give me goosebumps nearly 20 years after I left State College, Pennsylvania, lovingly called Happy Valley. Looking down from my perch on other colleges over the past decade, I've watched major programs crumble as their dirty little secrets were revealed. And through all those college scandal headlines -- paying players, inflating SAT scores, falsifying classroom grades -- I have held Penn State up as a shining example of all that is good and right and pure about college sports. We are the good guys. We have Joe Paterno. We are ... Penn State. But today, I'm putting my pompoms down. I'm done covering up Happy Valley's secrets. And it's time for others in the program, starting with Coach Paterno, to do the same thing. And then, Joe has got to go, immediately. That is the only real alternative after the shocking allegations that Jerry Sandusky, 67 -- a former assistant coach who worked with the program for more than 30 years and who was viewed by many as Paterno's heir before he retired in 1999 -- has been charged with multiple felonies in the alleged sexual abuse of eight boys during a 15-year period. Prosecutors now expect that more boys will come forward with abuse claims. Before this week, I'd argued that Jo Pa should coach until he takes his last breath. He'd earned it. This year, Penn State tied with Stanford for the top graduation success rate among teams ranked in the October 30 Bowl Championship Series and AP Top 25 rankings, according to the NCAA. During his 46-year tenure, Paterno has had 47 Academic All-Americans, with 37 earning first-team honors. I made excuses for Penn State in 2007 when the women's basketball coach, Renee Portland, quit after the university was sued over her ""no lesbians on the team"" policy. Portland, who had coached at the university for 27 years, was accused of bullying and humiliating one of her young players because she believed the girl was a lesbian. Portland's homophobic views were well-known on the team. Still, I reasoned that she was just a rogue coach, an anomaly at the school. Surely, her brand of bigotry was not the norm. Right? And I even defended Penn State after my own ugly experience with discrimination, when an adviser for the cheerleading squad tried to force me to quit the team after I was elected by my peers as the first African-American captain. It wasn't the only racial hatred I'd experienced at the school. In the late '80s, it was routine to find the campus littered with leaflets from the local Ku Klux Klan telling us blacks to ""Go back to Africa."" Sometimes the writer even drew a nice little noose on the fliers. But I stayed at the school, kept cheering on my Nittany Lions. I was proud to be there. Plus, I reasoned that my struggles there would prepare me for the real world. Now, I've run out of excuses. According to a grand jury report, Paterno back in 2002 was informed by a grad assistant that he had seen former Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky naked and forcing a boy who appeared to be about 10-years-old to have anal sex in the showers of the school's sports complex. Paterno reportedly told his boss, Athletic Director Tim Curley, but it's unclear whether the coach did anything further to follow up on the shocking report. And incredibly no one, Paterno or his superiors, reported this alleged incident to the authorities. Those of us who have been on campus find it a joke that Coach Paterno would now say that he reported the incident to his bosses. What bosses? Everyone knows Paterno had as much or more power on that campus than anyone to make things happen, including the president. It's absolutely unforgivable if Paterno did nothing but pass the information up the chain. In fact, even after this incident was reported, Sandusky still had the keys to the complex and free rein to bring boys he mentored at his nonprofit foundation, the Second Mile, to visit the campus and hang out around the sports facility. If these allegations are proven true, this scandal is far worse than anything that's happened at other universities. Exploiting dozens and raping young boys could never compare to the minor infractions of boosters buying a car for a player or a player selling his autographed football jersey for a few bucks. Now, as I look back at my years at Penn State and realize that some of these alleged incidents were possibly taking place as I was a student there proudly waving my pompoms, I feel sick. We are ... Penn State. And we are ashamed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roxanne Jones.","Roxanne Jones is a proud Penn State alum, former Nittany Lions cheerleader .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The emergency room doctor who declared Michael Jackson dead testified Monday in the involuntary manslaughter trial of Dr. Conrad Murray that there was no way doctors could have revived the pop icon after he arrived at the hospital. Dr. Richelle Cooper testified Friday that Murray never told her that he had given Jackson the surgical anesthetic propofol before he stopped breathing, but she said Monday it would not have made a difference if he had because Jackson ""had died long before."" ""It is unlikely with that information that I would have been able to do something different that would have changed the outcome,"" Cooper said. Prosecutors argue that Murray's failure to tell paramedics and doctors trying to resuscitate Jackson about the propofol is one of the negligent acts that make him criminally responsible for Jackson's death. Another doctor testified Monday that the decision to place an aortic balloon pump in Jackson's heart was ""a desperate attempt, even though very much futile"" effort intended ""to prepare Dr. Murray mentally to accept the fact that Mr. Jackson could not be rescued and would allow Mr. Jackson to depart in peace and dignity."" Dr. Thao Nguyen said Murray asked that ""we not to give up easily and try to save Mr. Michael Jackson's life,"" Nguyen said, even though it seemed hopeless. They placed a balloon pump in Jackson's aorta in an unsuccessful effort to restart his heart, she said. ""It's not a case of too little, too late, but a case of too late,"" Nguyen said. Monday was the fifth day of testimony in Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial, which is expected to last at least four more weeks. The trial resumed without Jackson's mother. Katherine Jackson left Los Angeles for Canada with her son's three children during the weekend to attend Sunday's premiere of Cirque du Soleil's ""Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour"" in Montreal. A source close to the Jackson family said she would not return to the trial at least until October 10, since she will also travel to Cardiff, Wales, for a tribute concert for her late son. Jackson family members in court Monday morning included siblings Janet, Rebe, Randy and Jermaine. Prosecutors argue that Murray, who was Jackson's personal physician as he prepared for planned comeback concerts, is criminally responsible for the singer's death because of medical negligence and his reckless use of propofol to help Jackson sleep. The coroner ruled that Jackson's June 25, 2009, death was the result of ""acute propofol intoxication"" in combination with sedatives. Dr. Cooper had recommended at 12:57 p.m., when Jackson was still at his home, that paramedics stop resuscitation efforts and declare him dead. Jackson was the first patient she had ever treated in the emergency room after having made such a recommendation to paramedics in the field, she said. ""I have never given a time of death in the field and then have that patient brought to me,"" she said. She said this exception was not because Jackson was a celebrity, but because the patient had a physician with them who did not want them to give up. Prosecutors have criticized Murray, who is a cardiologist, for using propofol on Jackson, contending it should be used only by anesthesiologists who have proper monitoring equipment. Cooper, a prosecution witness, acknowledged under questioning by defense lawyer Michael Flanagan that she uses it regularly as an emergency room doctor. A Houston, Texas, doctor called by the prosecution Monday paid Dr. Murray a compliment Monday afternoon, saying she was ""impressed"" with Murray's ability to remember a patient and that patient's treatment when she called him ""out of the blue."" Dr. Joanne Bednarz-Prashad's testimony was important for the prosecution because she is one of the several people who spoke to Dr. Murray on the phone the morning Jackson died. Prosecutors say he effectively abandoned Jackson by leaving his bedroom to talk on the phone that morning. Dr. Bednarz-Prashad called Murray's cell phone to get his advice on a patient he had treated who was about to undergo surgery at a Houston hospital. Most doctors she calls in such circumstances have to call back after consulting medical charts, she said, but Murray recalled the correct information immediately. Prosecutors also called the first of three of Murray's girlfriends to the witness stand to talk about their conversations with the doctor just before he realized Jackson had stopped breathing . The judge prevented the prosecution from digging into the personal relationship between Murray and Bridgette Morgan, who previously testified at Murray's preliminary hearing about meeting the married doctor in a Las Vegas night club in 2003. Morgan's call to Murray came about 30 minutes before Murray apparently discovered there was a problem with his patient. Sade Anding, a cocktail waitress who met Murray when she was working at a Houston steakhouse, is likely to be one of the first witnesses Tuesday. Anding testified in January that she was on the phone with Murray when he suddenly stopped responding to her just before noon the day Jackson died. That is the moment prosecutors contend Murray first realized that Jackson had stopped breathing. ""I didn't hear him on the phone any more,"" Anding said. ""I heard commotion as if the phone was in a pocket and I heard coughing and I heard a mumbling of voices."" Anding said she stayed on the phone for another five minutes, listening and wondering why the man she sometimes dated wasn't responding. ""Hello, hello, are you there?"" she testified she said. The timing of the phone call is key to the prosecution's time line of when Murray realized his famous patient was dying. Based on testimony so far, the moment came at 11:57 p.m. Nicole Alvarez, the mother of Murray's youngest child, may follow them on the witness stand. Her testimony is especially important because the propofol Murray used on Jackson was shipped to her Santa Monica, California, apartment. Alvarez, 29, who met Murray around 2005 in a Las Vegas gentlemen's club, made it clear when she previously testified that she knew little about the doctor's activities. ""Dr. Murray and I were on a need-to-know basis, and I just know my place and my position in his life,"" Alvarez said. Murray called Alvarez from the ambulance as he accompanied Jackson to the hospital, according to testimony in the preliminary hearing. Representatives from two cell phone companies testified Monday morning about records of calls to and from Murray's cell phones the morning Jackson died. The call times play a key role in determining the time line of what Murray was doing in the hours before Jackson's death. The judge instructed lawyers not to disclose their witness list ahead of time. However, the prosecution has been following the same order of witnesses used in Murray's preliminary hearing in January. Los Angeles Police homicide Detective Dan Myers, who led the Los Angeles Police Department investigation of Jackson's death, is likely to testify Tuesday or Wednesday. Los Angeles County Coroner Investigator Elissa Fleak will probably testify within the next two days about searching Jackson's home after his death. She said at the preliminary hearing that she found seven pill bottles on the nightstand next to Jackson's bed and an empty bottle of propofol on the floor near his bed. Murray's defense lawyers contend Jackson caused his own death by swallowing eight lorazepam pills and orally ingesting propofol while Murray was out of the room. The judge imposed a gag order Friday, preventing lawyers for Murray from talking to reporters about the case. His order came after he learned Matt Alford, a law partner to lead defense lawyer Ed Chernoff, gave a television interview to NBC's Ann Curry on Friday morning. If convicted of involuntary manslaughter, Murray could spend four years in a California prison and lose his medical license.","NEW: First of three Murray girlfriends takes the witness stand Monday .

"Manchester, New Hampshire (CNN) -- Seven Republican presidential contenders faced off Monday in one of the first debates of the primary season, offering policy ideas and criticism of President Barack Obama to try to separate themselves from the competition almost 17 months before the 2012 election. With Obama intent on re-election, Republican viewers were paying particularly close attention to try to determine which candidates can defeat an incumbent who won in 2008 with strong support from independent, minority and young voters. Some of the contenders made news in the debate, with conservative Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota announcing she filed her papers Monday and would soon declare her formal candidacy for president. ""We're going to win,"" Bachmann said of Republican chances in the 2012 vote, drawing applause from the GOP audience at St. Anselm College's Sullivan Arena. ""Make no mistake about it. President Obama is a one-term president."" Dressed in dark suits, the candidates offered brief introductions in lieu of opening statements that emphasized their experience and values. The tone remained direct but cordial throughout the two-hour debate, with candidates focusing their strongest criticism for Obama. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the early front-runner in polls after his unsuccessful bid for the GOP nomination in 2008, maintained a steady drumbeat of criticism of Obama, saying the president's policies have failed and the administration erroneously thinks it knows what is best for the economy. ""He's failed the American people both on job creation and the scale of government, and that's why he's not going to be re-elected,"" Romney said, while Bachmann said Obama's economic report card ""right now has a big failing grade on it."" Bachmann also lambasted Obama's Libya policy, calling it ""substantially flawed"" and noting the United States still is uncertain about whether al Qaeda figures are part of the Libyan opposition trying to oust Moammar Gadhafi. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum said Obama had ""turned his back on American allies and he has embraced our enemies,"" while Texas Rep. Ron Paul called for an end to drone strikes in Yemen and Pakistan, saying ""our national security is not enhanced by our presence over there."" In the end, all praised each other, with Romney declaring that any of the seven on stage would be a better president than Obama. But CNN iReporter Charlotte Durden, an unemployed realtor and computer teacher from Long Beach, California, took issue with that notion. ""I think that we, the American people, should be upset that these seven candidates have all of the answers and, if they were president ... the county would be in a better place,"" according to Durden, who said she typically votes Democratic. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Monday showed Romney grabbing the support of 24% of Republicans and independents who lean toward the GOP. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin came in second at 20%, followed by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and the rest of the field. Palin and Giuliani, who have not announced that they will join the race, did not participate in Monday's CNN/WMUR/New Hampshire Union Leader debate. Participants were declared presidential candidates Romney, businessman-turned-talk show host Herman Cain, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, Paul, Santorum and Bachmann. The debate included questions from journalists, audience members and voters at gatherings across the state, which will hold the first presidential primary next year. Romney is the heavy early favorite in New Hampshire due to his time as governor in neighboring Massachusetts. Moderated by CNN's John King, the debate covered major domestic and foreign policy issues including economic policy, deficit reduction and the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. Answers illuminated key differences between the candidates. For example, when asked about a controversial Republican proposal to overhaul the government-run Medicare health insurance program for senior citizens, Gingrich cautioned against an extreme step akin to the Democratic health care reform law unanimously opposed by GOP legislators. He made similar comments when he kicked off his campaign last month and had to backtrack then under heavy Republican criticism, and on Monday night he moderated his stance by supporting the overall proposal with some modifications. The other candidates generally backed a major structural reform of Medicare. Gingrich, Pawlenty and Cain all drew applause by declaring their support for right-to-work legislation passed in some states that halts required union membership, and Pawlenty defended his economic plan introduced this week that was based on 5% annual growth, which has rarely been achieved in modern U.S. history. ""This idea that we can't have 5% growth in America is hogwash,"" Pawlenty said. ""It's a defeatist attitude. If China can have 5% growth and Brazil can have 5% growth, then the United States of America can have 5% growth. And I don't accept this notion that we're going to be average or anemic. So my proposal has a 5% growth target."" As the current favorite, Romney faced criticism from his fellow candidates. Santorum, an ardent foe of abortion, said it was important to look at a candidate's record when asked about Romney's policy switch from a pro-choice stance as Massachusetts governor to a pro-life stance in the 2008 campaign and today. Voters looking at candidates should consider ""the authenticity of that candidate"" and look at the record over time to see ""what they've been willing to fight for,"" Santorum said, touting his own pro-life credentials. Romney responded by saying that he believed ""people understand that I'm firmly pro-life,"" adding he would support Supreme Court justices who follow the Constitution rather than ""legislate from the bench"" and that he believed in the sanctity of life from beginning to end. Pawlenty, meanwhile, avoided an opportunity to repeat his criticism of health care reform in which he tied Obama's health care law to Romney's health care legislation in Massachusetts, coining a word: ""Obamneycare."" When pressed on Monday, Pawlenty declined to repeat the phrase with Romney standing nearby. While Romney was a focus of attention at the debate, Gingrich had the most to prove after last week's exodus of 16 top aides from his campaign less than a month after he formally announced his 2012 bid. The outgoing staff cited the candidate's questionable work ethic and fundraising ability as their reason for abandoning the campaign. Gingrich has vowed to continue and sought Monday to use his strong skills as a debater to demonstrate that his candidacy is still viable. When asked about immigration reform, Gingrich angrily rejected the narrow definition of the question, saying candidates should avoid giving a yes or no answer on such a complex issue. Also in the field Monday was Paul, who tried to appeal to a national audience in his third presidential bid. Paul has devoted and energetic followers, but he is thought to be somewhat out of the mainstream of GOP politics thanks to his calls to scale back U.S. military efforts abroad and his attempts to get rid of the Federal Reserve. But in the aftermath of the 2010 midterm elections, which saw Republicans make gains up and down the ballot after running campaigns built on scaling back the size of government, Paul insists that Republicans are moving toward his proposals. Santorum, Bachmann and Cain are all well-known in social conservative circles and now are vying for the support of that key voting bloc. All prompted applause Monday with forceful statements on red-meat conservative issues. Cain repeated that he would be uncomfortable with a Muslim in his Cabinet unless he was sure it wasn't one ""trying to kill us,"" while Santorum and Bachmann backed a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and woman. Santorum, however, broke from most of the other contenders by backing the repeal of the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy barring openly gay military personnel. CNN iReporter Egberto Willies challenged the value of the entire debate, saying it ""lacked intellect."" ""We heard nothing but talking points,"" he said. ""We've given these guys a platform to spill talking points that ultimately will never solve America's problems."" CNN's Paul Steinhauser, Peter Hamby, Tom Cohen, Mark Preston and Ed Payne contributed to this report.","Debate ends on lighter note with candidates praising each other .

"(CNN) -- Kenya's Patrick Makau set a new world record for the marathon in Berlin Sunday as previous record holder Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia failed to finish. Makau led home a Kenyan 1-2-3 in a time of two hours three minutes 38 seconds, shaving 21 seconds off the record set in the corresponding race in the German capital three years ago by Gebrselassie. Stephen Kwelio Chemlany took second with Edwin Kimaiyo placing third. Gebrselassie, 38, was prominent until the 35km mark before dropping out, just as he had done in the New York marathon last November. He was trying to gain a qualifying time for the 2012 London Olympics and will now target the Dubai marathon early next year to achieve his aim. Makau, 26, was successfully defending his Berlin crown, with the added bonus of taking the world record on a traditionally fast course. Kenya's Florence Kiplagat won the women's race in two hours 19 minutes and 43 seconds with Germany's Irina Mikitenko in second place. Britain's world record holder Paula Radcliffe finished third on her comeback to marathon after giving birth to her second child and a series of injuries. Her time of two hours 23 minutes 46 minute was over eight minutes slower than her world's best but qualifies her for the Olympics on home soil.","Patrick Makau of Kenya sets new world record in marathon .

"(CNN) -- Enduring privations of his own as a Civil War prisoner in Georgia, Cpl. Charles H. Knox was concerned about his wife and small child back home in upstate New York. Eight days before Camp Lawton was evacuated as Union forces closed in, Knox wrote to his wife, Frances, saying she might consider selling the family cow to raise money. Georgia Southern University Museum in Statesboro on Thursday announced the $2,100 acquisition of Knox's letter and medals from private collections. The correspondence is the only known surviving letter from Lawton prison, which was built near Millen, the university said. More artifacts unearthed at site of Civil War prison in Georgia . In his letter, Knox expresses hope that he will be part of a prisoner exchange between Union and Confederate forces. It was not to be. Knox, a member of the 1st Connecticut Cavalry captured by Confederate forces in May 1864 during the Wilderness Campaign in Virginia, was returned to the notorious Camp Sumter, commonly known as Andersonville. In his letter, Knox refers to the North as ""God's Land"" and the South as ""Cecesia,"" a reference to its secession from the United States. ""Little Charlie"" is his 4-year-old son. Knox also kept a diary about his experiences as a prisoner. He was paroled at Andersonville on February 27, 1865, near war's end, and resumed his career as a carpenter. He died in February 1895 at age 70. Knox's letter: . Lawton Prison, Ga November 14th, 1864 . Dear Wife, haveing a chance to send a line into God's Land-- & hopeing you may hear from me by it I write a few lines hopeing they will reach you in safety -- I have written to you every month since I was captured the 5th of May, last & have seen hard times since, but now hopeing the scene may soon change, for we all look for an exchange of most if not all of the Prisinors that are here -- God knows I hope so... for I am tired of (Cecesia) I have been a Prisnor 6 months & 9 days & I think that will do for this time, but I must change the subject ..

"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho's bust-up with a Barcelona coach has cost the Real Madrid boss a two-match ban which will not affect his pitch-side attendance in La Liga this season. The 48-year-old was punished after being seen jabbing a finger into the eye of Barcelona assistant Tito Vilanova at the end of the second leg Spanish Super Cup in August. Vilanova was suspended for one match for slapping the Portuguese in retaliation, with both men also fined 600 euros ($800). However, the suspensions apply only to the pre-season Super Cup played between the league champions and Copa del Rey winners, and not other domestic matches. Barca's website noted on Wednesday that the Spanish Football federation's ruling indicated ""the absence of injury or lack of conclusive evidence on the intention to do harm by Mr. Mourinho."" The August 17 match had erupted in ugly scenes in a repeat of last season's enmity between the two teams, with Barca winning 3-2 for a 5-4 aggregate success. Marcelo was sent off for a bad tackle on Barca's new signing Cesc Fabregas, whose teammate David Villa was red-carded along with Real's Mesut Ozil when both returned to the pitch from the substitutes' bench. Last season, Mourinho was given a European touchline ban for incidents in the tempestuous Champions League semifinal ties between the two teams. Real lost 3-1 on aggregate and Barca went on to claim the title for the fourth time.","Real Madrid coach handed two-match ban for future Spanish Super Cup matches .

"(CNN) -- There are many luxurious amenities a business traveler enjoys while sleeping on the road: fluffy beds, room service, decked-out fitness centers and concierges. These amenities make traveling more comfortable. But when it comes down to it, take it from Dorothy: There's no place like home. Some business travelers say they prefer staying in furnished vacation rentals, corporate housing and inns versus hotels, particularly for lengthier stays. That's not just because alternative accommodations usually come with more space, free Wi-Fi, free laundry facilities and free parking, but doing so helps battle the lonesome blues while offering homey and off-the-beaten-path experiences. ""Living in hotels can be very depressing,"" says Mark Mule, a traveling pit orchestra musician who is usually on the road for weeks or months at a time. ""Corporate and vacation rentals are homes. This is good for your head."" Hotel occupancy rates have slowly declined in recent years. Nationally, hotels enjoyed 63% average occupancy in 2005, according to Smith Travel Research. By the end of 2010, that figure had fallen to 57.6% (but it's up from its five-year low in 2009 of 54.6%). That's partly because of increased supply and less demand since then. As the economy recovers, travelers seek value. In a September 2010 survey by vacation rental booking site HomeAway.com, 10% of travelers say they have stayed in a vacation rental for a business trip, and 42% say they would consider a vacation rental while traveling for business. But booking a hotel still has its benefits. Survey results by market research group PhoCusWright show that hotels are, by far, the first-choice venue for corporate meetings and events, so staying in them is extremely convenient for attendees. Hotels providing newer, better club lounges . There's usually a fully equipped business center, maybe a pool and wait service. Members of hotel loyalty programs enjoy perks like free nights, free room upgrades, access to VIP lounges and preferential treatment. Sites like HomeAway.com, VacationRentals.com, VRBO.com, CorporateHousing.com, Wyndham Vacation Rentals (which rents the Breckenridge, Colorado, property in the photo above) and Craigslist.com have been around awhile for individuals to book short-term rentals, but new Web ventures such as AirBnB.com and Roomorama.com are making it possible for travelers to obtain cheaper rates for nightly lodging. Adventurous entrepreneurs can rent a room, but full, vacant properties are also available. AirBnB, which started in 2007, booked half of its 2 million bookings in the last six months, but it doesn't keep statistics on how many of those are business-related. The convenience of paying one price for furniture, housewares, amenities and utilities is attractive to business travelers, says Amanda Cook, director of membership and marketing for the Corporate Housing Providers Association. ""Corporate housing is ... specific to [clients'] unique needs and reduces stress for the user, which in turn makes them more productive at their jobs,"" Cook says. Saving money and hatred for nickel-and-diming are many travelers' motivations for booking alternative lodging, particularly at inns, 91% of which have free Wi-Fi and full breakfast, says Marti Mayne of the bed-and-breakfast industry's Better Way to Stay campaign. Many B&Bs also offer meal and activity packages, wine and cheese receptions, and 24/7 guest snack pantries. Other travelers seek more control over their routines. ""I almost exclusively stay in places I find through services such as AirBnB,"" says grant writer and frequent business traveler Ron Flavin. ""The reason I do this is to stay fit. Staying in an apartment with a kitchen makes it easy for me to prepare healthy meals."" Chris Brisson, an entrepreneur and co-founder of Automizeit.com, has used vacation rental websites AirBnB.com and VRBO.com to find private, local experiences for small, off-site company meetings. One of his recent snags? A three-story beachfront mansion in Costa Rica for $225 per night. When traveling overseas for the long term, travel security expert Clinton Emerson suggests checking with the destination's U.S. Embassy, which performs security and safety checks on vetted rental properties. This helps prevent what happened to Comunicano CEO Andy Abramson, who once reserved a corporate apartment online that did not turn out as promised. ""The matter got resolved, but not without a loss of time and effort to get the kind of apartment we had reserved,"" he says. ""Given the corporate apartment rentals are usually represented by multiple agencies, the key is to work with one that's reputable and to find a company where the level of consistency is there."" While more options are available for business travelers willing to be diligent, staying in a reputable hotel may be better when staying for the first time in a city, says Faruq Hunter, an executive vice president with GeniusCo who travels seven months out of the year. There's a better chance it will be close to the action and meet a traveler's comfort and safety standards, he adds. ""Remember the purpose of your trip,"" Hunter says. Those who don't mind getting personal could consider staying with clients and colleagues, as public relations executive Elyse Bender-Segall does. ""I have established great relationships with all of my clients and enjoy getting to know them on a personal level when I am in their towns,"" she says. ""To me, it feels more like home rather than to wake up alone in an unfamiliar hotel in a random city."" But travelers who really miss home may opt to skip overnights altogether. ""My schedule gets so tight sometimes that I choose not to spend a night in a hotel,"" says Ismail Humet, co-founder of MyFreebeez.com. ""Instead, I take a red-eye flight back and get some sleep on the plane. Oftentimes, a last-minute upgrade to first class will cost less than a room plus meal expenses. First class is comfortable enough for me. It's more important to get back home and spend time with my family.""","Some business travelers prefer furnished vacation rentals over hotels .

"London (CNN) -- News International chief James Murdoch rejected allegations Thursday his company behaved like a Mafia organization over the News of the World phone-hacking scandal. The accusation was put to the son of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch as he faced questions from lawmakers about what he knew and when. It is alleged that his company's newspaper intercepted cellphone calls and messages of almost 5,800 royals, politicians, celebrities and business leaders -- and most controversially of all, a 13-year-old murder victim. Public outrage over the scandal later led News International to close the best-selling tabloid in July and abandon a bid to take over British broadcaster BSkyB. Questioning Murdoch about why so little information was shared, Labour Member of Parliament Tom Watson suggested the company operated an ""omerta"" code of silence. He said the ""omerta"" was ""a group of people who are bound together by secrecy, who together pursue their group's business objectives with no regard for the law, using intimidation, corruption and general criminality."" ""Would you agree with me that this is an accurate description of News International in the UK?"" Watson asked. Murdoch replied: ""Absolutely not, I frankly think that's offensive and it's not true."" To gasps of amazement from fellow MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Watson went on: ""You must be the first Mafia boss in history who didn't know he was running a criminal enterprise."" Murdoch rolled his eyes, before saying that comment was ""inappropriate."" He said he ""disputed vigorously"" the version of events described by former News of the World editor Colin Myler and its former legal manager Tom Crone, who both left the company when the tabloid was closed. Myler and Crone claimed they made Murdoch aware of the contents of the so-called ""for Neville"" e-mail in 2008, indicating phone-hacking was widespread. The document is known as the ""for Neville"" e-mail, apparently after its intended recipient Neville Thurlbeck, then News of the World's chief reporter. CNN's Atika Shubert said Murdoch was caught in a ""Catch-22"" situation: if he wasn't aware of the extent of phone-hacking when the company paid an out-of-court settlement of $1.2 million to one victim, he could be seen to be incompetent; if he did know about it, it could be regarded there was a cover-up. Murdoch has maintained he only found about the full extent of phone-hacking by staff and investigators at News of the World in 2010 and was not shown the e-mail. Asked by Watson if he had misled the committee during his previous high-drama appearance alongside his father in July, Murdoch said: ""No, I did not."" He added: ""I believe this committee was given evidence by individuals either without full possession of the facts, or now it appears in the process of my own discovery ... it was economical."" Asked if he was accusing Myler and Crone of misleading the committee, Murdoch replied: ""Certainly in the evidence they gave to you in 2011 in regard to my own knowledge, I believe it was inconsistent and not right, and I dispute it vigorously."" Questioned about the ""for Neville"" e-mail that included transcripts of 35 hacked conversations, Murdoch denied again having seen it. His statement contradicted a letter Crone wrote to lawmakers in the summer saying he had ""no doubt"" Murdoch was aware of the e-mail in a meeting before he signed the check for $1.2 million. Murdoch said Thursday: ""I want to be very clear. No documents were shown to me or given to me at that meeting or prior to it."" Taking a contrite tone, Murdoch told lawmakers that the scandal had ""humbled"" the whole company and that he was ""very sorry"" about what had happened. He also said the company had ""moved into an aggressive defense too quickly"" when some of the claims were made against it in early 2010. If he had known then what he knows now, he said, he would have acted differently. Murdoch's position at the helm of News International is widely believed to have been jeopardized by the scandal, which has cost its parent company $150 million. Amid the furore, the Murdochs abandoned their attempt to buy the shares they did not own in British broadcaster BSkyB. Thursday's hearing came only days after News International admitted the Sunday tabloid hired a private detective to spy on lawyers defending hacking victims. Murdoch said he had no knowledge of the ""appalling"" and ""unacceptable"" action for which he apologized ""unreservedly."" The phone-hacking scandal blew up in July when News International admitted investigators hacked into the phone of missing teenager Milly Dowler, deleting messages to allow room for more. This gave the 13-year-old's family hope that she was still alive when she was already dead. Then it was alleged families of soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as relatives of 9/11 victims had been targeted and police officers bribed. Amid a storm of outrage and a boycott by advertisers, News of the World was closed down shortly afterwards while chief executive Rebekah Brooks and long-time Murdoch aide Les Hinton resigned. In July the Murdochs were summoned before parliament. At the dramatic appearance, Rupert Murdoch denied he was to blame for the scandal, but declared that this was ""the most humble day of my life."" Afterwards, Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron said James Murdoch had ""questions to answer in Parliament,"" after Myler and Crone accused their former boss of giving ""mistaken"" evidence. Until this year, News International had maintained that hacking was confined to one rogue reporter, Clive Goodman, and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, who were jailed in 2007 for intercepting the royal family's phones.

"(CNN) -- Syrian opposition groups said Saturday that they have formed a breakaway government, but many details were yet to emerge. The Local Coordination Committees, which organizes and documents protests against the Syrian regime, said 188 seats have so far been assigned to the council, but it may be 24 hours before the announcement of a presidential body. Groups including the Muslim Brotherhood of Syria, the Revolution Forces, the Public Council for Revolution Forces and the Superior Council of the Revolution have all joined the LCC in the opposition government, the LCC said Saturday. The groups are trying to create a Syrian National Council aimed at toppling the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Syria has been locked in a violent months-long uprising that has seen security forces clash with anti-government protesters calling for free elections and the end of al-Assad's rule. Activists said at least eight people died in protests and random shootings on Saturday, a day after the government said 13 security forces and three civilians died in clashes and an opposition group said 23 people, mostly civilians, died in the fighting. Activists also said women marched near the presidential palace in Damascus on Saturday, demanding the fall of the regime, the release of detainees and the lifting of blockades throughout the country. CNN is unable to independently confirm the claims. Al-Assad, who has characterized the protesters as ""armed gangs,"" has insisted his security forces are battling terrorists intent on targeting civilians and fomenting unrest. The United States, the European Union and a number of Arab countries have called an al-Assad to end the crackdown and step down. Tensions between the United States and Syria escalated after the Syrian ambassador to the U.S. was called Friday to the State Department over an attempted attack a day earlier in Damascus on American Ambassador Robert Ford, spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters. ""The ambassador was reminded that Ambassador Ford is the personal representative of the president, and an attack on Ford is an attack on the United States,"" Nuland said. About 100 pro-government protesters tried to storm a meeting between Ford and opposition leader Hassan Abdelazim, trapping Ford and others for more than an hour. Later, his convoy was attacked. The al-Assad regime had earlier accused Washington of inciting ""armed groups"" into violence against its security forces. Nuland said Ambassador Imad Mustapha was asked to compensate the United States for damage to the vehicles. In a Facebook post Friday, Ford said he respected ""peaceful protest"" -- including by pro-government factions to express their opposition to him and U.S. policy -- but insisted that Thursday's incident was ""not peaceful."" He described demonstrators wielding iron bars; throwing tomatoes, eggs and concrete blocks; attacking embassy vehicles; and trying to break into Azim's office. ""Americans understand that we are seeing the ugly side of the Syrian regime, which uses brutal force, repression and intimidation to stay in power,"" Ford wrote. ""We deeply feel for the Syrian families that are enduring the violence, killings and torture and pain. We hope that Syrians find solutions to the crisis soon, but we strongly doubt that the regime's terrorizing the population will end the crisis."" Syrian state-run media, citing the Foreign Ministry, reported Friday that ""necessary measures"" had been taken to protect Ford. Taking a page from the success of Libya's National Transitional Council, Syrian opposition groups meeting in Istanbul worked together to bring the various groups under one opposition umbrella. Among those expected to be represented by the National Council are the Muslim Brotherhood, the Assyrian Organization and the General Authority of the Syrian Revolution, the LCC said. The LCC does not identify its membership out of a fear of reprisals by al-Assad's security forces. CNN cannot independently verify the claims of the group because the Syrian government has denied international journalists access to the country. The meeting concluded the same day news broke that prominent anti-government activist Marwa al-Ghemyan was detained Friday by Syrian security forces at the Damascus airport. Al-Ghemyan was detained as she was preparing to depart the capital and taken to a military security building, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said in a statement. The opposition group, which documents Syria's anti-government movement, did not say how it confirmed her detention. Al-Ghemyan was previously detained by Syrian forces on March 4 and released on March 21, the group said. CNN's Elise Labott, Hamdi Alkhshali and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","NEW: Syrian opposition say they have formed breakaway government council .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson was ""totally addicted to propofol,"" the surgical anesthetic the coroner ruled killed him, the pop star's dermatologist said in an interview with the In Session network. Dr. Arnold Klein said he personally tried several times to prevent other doctors from administering propofol to Jackson for sleep. ""I knew this problem existed,"" Klein said in the interview Saturday. ""I did my best to prevent it. Whenever I could, I prevented it, but I'm only one man and I have to support my own life and take care of myself."" Klein disputed the argument by Dr. Conrad Murray's lawyers that he addicted Jackson to Demerol in the months before his death, saying he used only low doses of the painkiller while repairing Jackson's collapsed nose and jawline. Because Demerol was not found in Jackson's blood, the judge did not allow Dr. Murray's defense to call Klein as a witness in Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial, in which jurors are scheduled to resume deliberations Monday morning. But medical records of Jackson's visit to Klein's Beverly Hills clinic were introduced as evidence. Klein described three instances in which he said he was involved as interventions to prevent Jackson from getting propofol, although Klein gave no indication of when the incidents occurred. In the first instance, Klein said he chartered a plane to Las Vegas when he heard Jackson was getting propofol at a hotel where the singer was staying. Klein claimed he threw out the doctor involved to prevent him from giving Jackson the drug. In another encounter in Hawaii, Klein said he and his nurse slept on the floor of Jackson's room to prevent him from getting propofol from a plastic surgeon. Klein claimed he once ""saved"" Jackson in New York when another doctor administered propofol, combined with another drug. It made Jackson go ""running down the street,"" Klein said. A Los Angeles County jury is deliberating the fate of Murray, the physician caring for Michael Jackson when he died in June 2009. Klein, interviewed in his Beverly Hills home, said that while it was too upsetting to watch much of the trial, he watched enough to believe Murray wanted to ""make me look like a demon"" and ""make me as a scapegoat."" Murray's defense contends Jackson became addicted to Demerol through frequent visits to Klein's Beverly Hills dermatology clinic in the months before his death. Murray was unaware of the addiction, and therefore unable to understand why he could not help Jackson sleep, the defense contends. Medical records presented to the jury showed at least 24 visits by Jackson to Klein's office from March 12 until June 22, 2009, three days before Jackson's death. The defense previously said Jackson was given 6,500 milligrams of Demerol at Klein's clinic during those visits. Jackson received 900 milligrams of Demerol at Klein's clinic over three days in early May, the records showed. ""I would never give a person those doses they attributed to me,"" Klein said. The records are misleading because he was in Paris during most of May, he said. Other doctors working out of Klein's office may have given Jackson that larger doses of Demerol, he said. When asked if Murray's defense team knew they were not all Klein's medical records, Klein responded by saying, ""They absolutely had to know. Why do you think they covered the signature on the bottom of the chart?"" It was noted during testimony that no doctor's signature was on the medical records. Murray's defense team, which is under an order from the judge not to talk to reporters about the case, did not immediately respond to Klein's comments. Klein said he began the slow and painful process of rebuilding some of Jackson's facial skin in early April after his nose collapsed and after he lost his jaw line. Jackson, who was preparing for his comeback concert tour, wanted to look his best, Klein said. ""Michael was an absolute perfectionist,"" he said. Klein said he is being attacked because he is different. He likened his plight to Galileo and Michael Jackson. He cited the molestation trial of Jackson as an example of how the singer was targeted for being different. Klein said he was angry about Jackson's death under Murray's care. ""Where did they find this man?"" he said. Jackson recruited Murray to work as his personal physician after Murray had treated him and his children for minor illnesses while they were in Las Vegas, according to testimony. Klein said he did not believe Jackson would approve of the current trial of his doctor. ""This is insanity,"" he said. CNN's Alan Duke contributed to this report.","Dermatologist says he intervened 3 times to prevent Jackson's getting propofol .

"Washington (CNN) -- A half dozen Supreme Court justices, hundreds of members of the legal profession and other dignitaries attended the annual Red Mass in Washington Sunday to hear a call for them to pay attention to their spiritual health. Chief Justice John Roberts joined associate justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Stephen Breyer and Samuel Alito for the service at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, a beautifully ornate church located a few blocks from the White House. All are Roman Catholic except Breyer, who is Jewish. The current Supreme Court is composed of six Catholics and three Jews. The purpose of the Red Mass -- so named because of the color of the garments worn by clergy -- is to ""invoke God's blessings on those responsible for the administration of justice as well as on all public officials,"" according to the John Carroll Society, a lay Catholic group of prominent lawyers and professionals, which started the Mass in 1953. The Mass is celebrated traditionally on the Sunday before the first Monday in October, which marks the beginning of the Supreme Court's annual term. Critics have called the attendance of leading decision-makers, including members of the highest court in the land, inappropriate. They see the services as an unhealthy mix of politics, the law and religion. The Mass is a Catholic service, but power brokers of other faiths are asked to attend the event, which was also open to the public. Sunday's attendees included Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood and White House Chief of Staff William Daley. Archbishop of Seattle Peter Sartain gave this year's sermon, which was largely devoid of controversy, telling those in attendance that ""we are not fully alive, even if we follow a balanced, healthy lifestyle ... unless we give ourselves to someone beyond ourselves."" ""In the end, it is in our relationship with the Lord in which we find the spiritual health that reveals and makes possible true balance, true integrity,"" Sartain said. However, at one point in the service after the main sermon during what's called the Prayer of the Faithful, Montgomery County, Maryland, Circuit Court Associate Judge Joseph Quirk made a quick reference to the unborn, reciting a short prayer, ""We pray for the inalienable right to life for every human being."" See some of the important cases the court will consider . Archdiocese of Washington spokeswoman Chieko Noguchi Scheve said the prayer readings are determined before the service by the John Carroll Society. Past homilies by individual speakers have lamented the high court's ruling legalizing abortion and the constitutional separation of church and state, prompting one justice to stop going. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg attended Red Masses in the past, but has said she grew tired of being lectured by Catholic officials. Ginsburg, like Breyer and Associate Justice Elena Kagan, is Jewish. ""I went one year, and I will never go again, because this sermon was outrageously anti-abortion,"" Ginsburg said in the book ""Stars of David: Prominent Jews talk About Being Jewish"" by author Abigail Pogrebin. ""Even the Scalias - although they're much of that persuasion - were embarrassed for me."" CNN Supreme Court Producer Bill Mears contributed to this report.","The service is meant to invoke God's blessings on public officials .

"Exmouth, England (CNN) -- ""We are the 99 percent."" This is the one belief all protesters in New York's Zuccotti Park have in common, according to OccupyWallSt.org. Although they claim to be using Arab Spring tactics, they are actually continuing a practice that emerged in Great Britain and the United States near the end of the 18th century, quickly spread to other countries and is now a truly transnational phenomenon. For centuries, the street had been the stage for the 1% of society instead. Members of the civic, religious and military elite used public spaces to present themselves and underline their claim of authority and status in elaborate and carefully choreographed processions. Nowadays, the street has primarily become the forum for those who feel excluded from the halls of power, or not properly represented by the existing political institutions. Mass street protest has acquired a degree of political legitimacy that is astonishing, considering that well into the 20th century, the sight of ordinary people acting collectively in public on behalf of their own interest was widely regarded as a prelude to social unrest or even revolution. The French writer Gustave Le Bon gave this widely held view pseudo-scientific credibility in his 1895 book ""The Crowd,"" which described the latter as a dangerous and primitive entity which was highly susceptible to manipulation by demagogues. The perception of collective street protest as a public order problem persisted well into the 20th century and only started to change with the arrival of the middle-class based ""New Social Movements"" after the Second World War. Until then, even democratic governments frequently felt at license to act with overwhelming force and sometimes great brutality against protesters. The American Civil Rights Movement skillfully exploited this to its advantage in the 1960s, and new doctrines of restrained policing were developed in several countries to deny protesters the status of martyrs. Police crackdowns on orderly protests became rare, although the WTO meeting in Seattle in 1999 marked a shift back to a stronger emphasis on public order, at least in the United States. The events around the blockade of Brooklyn Bridge on October 1st show the dangers of this approach. Although the police framed their actions as a measure to keep the traffic flowing -- an argument that authorities around the world have used since the late 19th century to regulate protest marches -- and did not arrest those who walked on the sidewalks, the detention of more than 700 people appeared heavy-handed. The incident, together with a police officer using pepper spray against female protesters, turned the largely ignored campaign into a media story. Gaining exposure and media coverage is an important aim of all street protest. It not only provides opportunities to present political demands but also to showcase the movement behind the protest. Already the Labour Movement, whose 19th century demonstrations provided the template for all subsequent demonstrations, used them to present the public with an image of the working class in action. The choreography of the march with its orderly columns, the way the marchers dressed and the banners they carried with them represented the Labour Movement's intention as well as ability to create an alternative order of society. The route of the column usually led them through the territory of their opponents or to the centers of political power, thereby laying claim to both of them. Subsequent movements such as the suffragettes or the unemployed often followed the same pattern. The protesters in New York continue this tradition. By having a leaderless structure and holding general assemblies every day, they further underline their opposition to the hierarchical undemocratic world of Wall Street and publicly perform the alternative model of society they are propagating. Occupying Zuccotti Park and referring to it by its former name, Liberty Plaza Park, makes the same point. At least as important as the chance to gain access to the media is the effect such protests have on supporters and sympathizers. Collective action and confrontations with the police foster the internal cohesion of movements. Small successes, such as circumventing the ban on megaphones by collectively repeating the words of each public speaker, provide a sense of empowerment and create a positive public image. Support from celebrities or academics such as Joseph Stiglitz give further encouragement. Taken together, such successes can have a mobilizing effect as the start of demonstrations and occupations in other U.S. cities shows. In the light of the relatively small number of people involved and the apparent scarcity of resources the movement controls, these are considerable achievements. Unlike the protest in Tahrir Square in Cairo, the protest in New York will not start a revolution. But it has started a public debate and forced the media in the United States and abroad to report on the event. Because of that, whether the protesters will eventually be able to occupy Wall Street is of no real significance. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Matthias Reiss.","Matthias Reiss: Occupy Wall Streeters say they are the 99%, as opposed to the wealthy .

"(CNN) -- Two leading world sports officials were sanctioned by the International Olympic Committee Thursday over cash payments they received from a collapsed sports marketing agency. The IOC executive board meeting in Lausanne handed down a warning to IAAF president Lamine Diack of Senegal, while Cameroon's Issa Hayatou, who heads the African football conferederation (CAF), was reprimanded. But both will remain as IOC members. The board was acting on recommendations made by the IOC Ethics Commission, who launched an investigation into corruption after a BBC television documentary which accused both men of taking money from International Sports and Leisure (ISL). The agency, which was declared bankrupt with debts of around $300,000 in 2001, had among its clients FIFA and the IAAF, which runs world athletics . The documentary also placed former FIFA President Joao Havelange under the microscope. The 95-year-old Brazilian resigned as an IOC member earlier this week and the case against him was closed. IOC President Jacques Rogge told a media conference Thursday that the fact Diack and Hayatou were not IOC members at the time they had taken money was a ""mitigating circumstance."" He added: ""The IOC has proved that we have a high respect for ethical behavior."" He refused to comment on Havelange's resignation. Havelange resigns from IOC . The details of the findings in the cases against Hayatou and Diack were published on the IOC official website Thursday. Hayatou admitted in his evidence that he had received 100,000 French francs from ISL in 1995, but claimed that it was used to celebrate the 40th anniversary of CAF, which he has headed since 1987. He produced minutes of a meeting in 1998 and a note from the CAF Finance Director from March 2011 to back his claims, but the IOC cast doubt on his explanation. ""It (the Ethics Commission) noted that the documents produced by the person concerned, drawn up a long time after receipt of the funds, do not guarantee that the payments were indeed made into the CAF accounts,"" read their ruling. ""It considers that personally accepting a sum of money in these conditions constitutes a conflict of interests."" Diack confirmed that in 1993 he had received three cash payments totaling $30,000 and 30,000 French francs from ISL executive Jean-Marie Weber. He said Weber had given him the money because he felt sorry for him after his house was burnt down ""for political reasons"" in March 1993. He denied any connection between the marketing contract that ISL and the IAAF, of which he was then a vice-president, signed in June that year. The Ethics Commission took into account his personal circumstances at the time, but added: . ""It notes that by accepting a cash donation in these conditions from a marketing partner of the International Federation of which he was vice-president, Mr Lamine Diack placed himself in a conflict of interests situation."" Hayatou's reprimand is a more serious sanction, but Rogge confirmed both men will be able to continue all their duties as IOC members.","Two leading sports officials sanctioned by IOC over cash payments .

"(CNN) -- The strong performance of Islamist parties in the Egyptian elections this week raised eyebrows in some Western capitals. On the one hand, analysts say, the West is inclined to support popular Arab Spring movements that have toppled dictators and brought nascent democracy to the region. On the other hand, they worry about the ascension of radical Islamist movements in a region of critical interest to the United States and its allies. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reflected that tension this week when she urged Islamist parties in Egypt to ""embrace democratic norms and rules"" by creating a government that respects the full range of human rights. ""Transitions require fair and inclusive elections, but they also demand that those who are elected embrace democratic norms and rules,"" Clinton said Tuesday in a speech to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, meeting in Lithuania. The Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist party widely seen as being relatively moderate, won more than 40% of the vote, according to initial election results. The more hardline al-Nour party took as much as 25%. Run-off votes were held at the start of this week and more ballots are to come, as Egypt's complicated election process continues. ""We ... expect all democratic actors and elected officials to uphold universal human rights, including women's rights, to allow free religious practice, to promote tolerance and good relations among communities of different faiths, and to support peaceful relations with their neighbors,"" Clinton said. Analysts say the strong showing of Islamist parties in the first parliamentary elections since the ouster of former President Hosni Mubarak, a long-time U.S. ally, could inflame regional tensions and complicate key relationships. ""I don't think any Western government is happy about the result of the elections,"" said Marina Ottaway, a Middle East analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace. While the Muslim Brotherhood has pledged to respect minority rights and work with liberal parties, much of the concern has focused on the success of al-Nour, a Salafist party that supports broader application of strict Islamic law in Egypt. How the United States deals with the often unpredictable results of democracy will be key. ""The old formula is not going to work and if we want to be in a position to influence, it will depend on our credibility and the strength of our support for the processes of change,"" said Steven Heydemann, senior adviser for Middle East Initiatives for the United States Institute of Peace, an independent conflict management think tank created and funded by the U.S. Congress. In May, President Barack Obama suggested a new formula, saying that the Arab Spring movements were an opportunity ""to show that America values the dignity of the street vendor in Tunisia more than the raw power of the dictator."" He followed up last month, when protests flared again in Cairo's Tahrir Square over concerns that the Egyptian military was trying to cling to power. At the time, he called for the move to a civilian government ""that responds to the legitimate aspirations of the Egyptian people, as soon as possible."" But the ability of the United States to influence that change came into focus again Tuesday, when the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces granted most presidential powers to Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri. He took office Wednesday and swore in his Cabinet, which will serve until presidential elections are held next June. Despite Obama's statements of support for a civilian government, Rami Shaath -- a member of the Egyptian Revolutionary Alliance -- reiterated previous statements contending that Ganzouri is a figurehead for the Supreme Council installed to ""serve the need of the U.S. in the region over its people's demands."" ""He was chosen by the Supreme Council with no political base from Tahrir,"" Shaath said. ""When we demanded a national salvation government, we wanted a representative from the revolutionaries, not a puppet that serves the goals of the military who do not have the right to choose him anyway."" Criticisms such as Shaath's show how little influence the United States has over what's happening in Egypt, and how little it has to gain even if it supports democratic movements there, Ottaway said. ""The most they can do is put some pressure on the liberal parties to make sure they really keep on talking to the Muslim Brotherhood,"" she said. Should the United States pull back from its support for democratization in the region, it will lose all credibility among the Egyptian people, Ottaway said. But even if the United States and other countries do continue to support democratic movements in the Middle East, public opinion in the region has barely shifted, Heydemann said. ""The Arab Spring dividend has proven elusive for the Obama administration,"" he said. The best course, analysts say, is for the United States to continue to support democratic movements while setting out expectations, much like Clinton did Tuesday in Lithuania. If they do, the problem may sort itself out, CNN's Fareed Zakaria said in an opinion piece on CNN.com. ""For decades, political Islam was the language through which people resisted dictatorial regimes. That gave these parties a special status, a kind of halo effect, which has helped them once the dictators fell,"" he said. But the only way these parties can retain their popularity once in power is to govern effectively, he said. ""And to be competent at governing and to stay in power, these groups have to moderate themselves,"" he wrote. ""The history of countries from Indonesia to Pakistan suggests that over time, the more radical political elements lose their popular appeal because their mystical attraction was tied up in their opposition to the dictatorships. Once the dictatorships go, their appeal dwindles."" But it won't be a quick process, Heydemann said. The region is in for years of tumult during which the new Arab Spring democracies sort out the differences between conservative and liberal visions of Islamic democracies. And in many respects, the West will be left on the sidelines, watching and waiting, he said. ""Across a broad spectrum of issues, we face a long period of uncertainty,"" he said. ""We're kind of stuck in a way.""","Egypt's complicated electoral process continues, with more votes to come .
Egyptian Islamists should embrace ""democratic norms,"" Secretary Clinton says .
Western leaders aren't happy about Islamist success, analyst says .
But the U.S. and other countries should stand behind democratization, analysts say ."
"(CNN) -- Six volunteer astronauts emerged from a 'trip' to Mars on Friday, waving and grinning widely after spending 520 days in seclusion. Crowds handed each member of the group a red rose after their capsule opened at the facility in Moscow. Scientists placed the six male volunteers in isolation in 2010 to simulate a mission to Mars, part of the European Space Agency's experiment to determine challenges facing future space travelers. The six, who are between ages 27 and 38, lived in a tight space the size of six buses in a row, said Rosita Suenson, the agency's program officer for human spaceflight. During the period, the crew dressed in blue jumpsuits showered on rare occasions and survived on canned food. Messages from friends and family came with a lag based on the simulated distance to Earth. While they had a few luxuries -- a Christmas tree and a Halloween party -- they spent most of their seclusion gathering data to help future space travel. The simulated trip replicated all aspects of a real spaceflight to Mars, including orbiting the planet, landing and returning to Earth. ""This was like taking a psychological trip to Mars ... it was the first full-duration of a human mission to Mars,"" Suenson said. Though it did not expose the six volunteers from China, Russia and Europe to the weightlessness and radiation of a space mission, it replicated an important aspect of space travel. ""The study is helping to determine key psychological and physiological effects of being in such an enclosed environment for such an extended period of time,"" the space agency said. Data from the mission will give experts an idea of how the mind and body would cope with a long spaceflight to the Red Planet, according to Suenson. On their return Friday, the Mars500 crew addressed the media briefly and urged experts to put their data to good use. They will meet select family members and undergo quarantine for four days. Extra seclusion will allow them to get reacquainted with their surroundings, including sound and light, Suenson said. The six had personal items such as books, films and personal laptops during their stay at the facility in Moscow's Institute for Biomedical Problems.","NEW: Crowds hand each member of the group a red rose .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  --   More than 33,000 items of old denim -- jeans, hats and jackets -- were sent to Washington in a recycling effort that will benefit disaster-struck homes, officials said. Erek Hansen donated five pairs of his own outgrown jeans to the cause and collected almost 1,700 pairs. National Geographic Kids magazine encouraged readers to donate their old denim instead of throwing it away. The resulting 33,088 pieces of denim clothing set a world record, verified Wednesday by a representative from Guinness World Records, according to the magazine's blog. The thousands of pairs of jeans, which are on display at Union Station for two weeks, will be turned into housing insulation for homes affected by natural disasters. According to the magazine, there will be enough material to provide insulation for 60 houses. The jeans will be turned over to Cotton Inc., which collects used denim for natural fiber insulation made without carcinogens or chemical irritants. Paula Rosario, vice president of consumer marketing for the company, said that the new record ""certainly attests to the civic-mindedness of today's children."" The ceremony unveiling the denim display also honored 9-year-old Erek Hansen, who collected nearly 1,700 jeans. The elementary school student from Curtice, Ohio, said that his friends and classmates ""were happy to help the environment."" Hansen donated five pairs of his own outgrown jeans. The display also includes a pair from actor Ben Stiller.","National Geographic Kids magazine encouraged readers to donate old denim .

"(CNN) -- When Apple introduced Siri, the talking, voice-activated ""personal assistant"" that will come with its new iPhone 4S, the Web leaped to the obvious, rational conclusion: That it's a sinister, potentially alien artificial intelligence that's bound to kill us all. ""If you're wondering, 'Siri' can be pronounced two ways: 'Skynet' and 'GLaDOS,"" wrote Twitter user @AshleyEsqueda. That's a reference to 1) the computer system in the ""Terminator"" stories that gains self-awareness and unleashes killer robots on mankind and 2) the talking, sinister artificial-intelligence system that puts players through their increasingly life-threatening paces in the ""Portal"" video game series. To be sure, Siri's coming-out party Tuesday at Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters seemed the stuff of science fiction. When Apple Vice President Scott Forstall asked Siri where to find a Greek restaurant in Palo Alto, a monotone female voice responded that she'd found five and had listed them for him in order of their customer-review rankings. She told Forstall when he had a text message, read it to him, took his ""dictation"" to respond to it and then made a lunch date for him. ""Do I have any meetings Friday at noon?"" Forstall asked. ""You don't have anything on your calendar,"" Siri replied. She even knew where he was. Forstall said he could ask her to remind him to call his wife when he left work. Using global positioning, he said, Siri would see when he left Apple's campus and speak up. But, for anyone who's ever pondered the inevitable rise of our digital overlords, here's the real kicker. Forstall asks this simple, if existential, question: ""Who are you?"" Siri's answer? ""I am a humble personal assistant."" Uh huh. That's what they all say. ""Siri may be the beginning of Skynet,"" wrote Twitter user @KingJamesVrsn. ""I swear, if my iPhone asks me if I am Sarah Connor..."" That wasn't the site's only reference to the famous scene in which Arnold Schwarzenegger, as a robot assassin, hunts for Linda Hamilton's Connor. In fact, ""Skynet"" was briefly a trending topic Tuesday on the microblogging site, which tends to buzz during high-profile tech events like the Apple announcement. ""SkyNet is currently trending,"" said user @jasonpinter. ""This is EXACTLY what Siri wants. Siri = Schwarzenegger Irradicating Redblooded Individuals."" Of course, some folks go for a more classic approach to menacing, monotone. Enter HAL 9000, the digital antagonist in Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" This being 2011 and all, HAL has his own Twitter feed and, of course, was quick to chime in. ""I think I went to school with Siri,"" @HAL9000 posted. ""Cute female computer but she talked too much."" Then HAL had an apparent fit of jealousy (which cannot be a good thing). ""Siri thinks she's so cool because she has voice recognition but can she lip read?"" HAL wrote, a reference to a famous ""2001"" scene. ""That's the sign of a truly awesome computer."" By the way, we've used ""she"" here to refer to Siri. Apple's literature uses the gender-neutral ""it."" We're basing our determination on the female voice, as well as the fact that ""Siri"" is a female name that appears in several languages and is most often credited with having Scandinavian origins. Its meaning in the frozen northlands: ""Victorious beauty."" Plus ... do we really want to make her mad?","Jokes about ""Skynet,"" ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" flood Web after Apple introduces ""Siri""

"(CNN) -- Virginia State Police say they have identified the gunman who fired a high-powered rifle at four county deputies, killing two of them, officials said Monday, but they still don't have a motive for the shootings. Buchanan County Deputies Eric Dewayne Rasnake, 32, and Shane Earl Charles, 25, were shot multiple times after responding to a ""larceny in progress"" call at a salvage business in Vansant, Virginia, Sheriff Roy Foster said. The wounded deputies were able to crawl to a nearby residence for cover. Deputies Cameron Neil Justus, 41, and William Ezra Stiltner, 46, were shot with the same high-powered weapon after they rushed to the scene to help their fallen comrades, police said. Justus and Stiltner died at the scene. ""Please take comfort in knowing that their sacrifice was not in vain,"" an emotional Foster said Monday. ""These two men gave their lives for what they dedicated their lives to doing,"" Foster said. On Monday, Virginia State Police named Randy Gilbert Newberry as the suspect in the shootings. Officials say the 52-year-old was hiding on a ridge when he fired at officers responding to both crime scenes. After the shootings, officials said, they found Newberry about a quarter of a mile up the road from the salvage business, talking on a cell phone. Police said they repeatedly asked Newberry to ""put his hands up and get on the ground,"" but the suspect ignored their orders and instead aimed a handgun at officers. According to the state police, Newberry was then shot and killed. The Buchanan County Sheriff's Office is dealing with the tragic loss of its men while Virginia State Police tries to determine a possible motive. Foster praised his officers for their valiant efforts in a difficult time. ""I appreciate every single one of you that was there fighting for the lives of your fallen brothers,"" he said. ""It's been about 40 years since Buchanan County lost a man in the line of duty,"" Foster said, and ""to lose two more and to have two more seriously injured in the same day is overwhelming."" Wounded deputies Rasnake and Charles both remain hospitalized. Rasnake was shot three times, according to Foster, and Charles is on a respirator. Both remain in critical condition. ""Our prayers go out to their families to the hope that they will recover and maybe one day return to wear the uniform that we so proudly wear,"" a tearful Foster said. The close community is coming together in support of the fallen deputies. Local media report that a Facebook page has been set up to seek prayers for the deputies. The site, which has more than 3,000 friends, is encouraging people to attend a candlelight service Monday night at the Buchanan County Courthouse. Foster says churches will also be open for support and encouraged the community to come in and fellowship.","NEW: Buchanan County community to honor deputies killed, wounded in line of duty .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. NATISHA LANCE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Fridays are always awesome here on CNN Student News. And we thank you for spending part of your Friday with us. Hi, everyone. I'm Natisha Lance, sitting in today for Carl Azuz. First Up: Congressional Hearings . LANCE: First up, we're talking about hearings on Capitol Hill that caused controversy even before they started. The House Homeland Security Committee is holding these hearings to look into the radicalization of American Muslims. Basically, the idea that a group like al Qaeda could recruit U.S. Muslims and turn them into terrorists. Some critics called the hearings an unfair attack on loyal Americans. But Representative Peter King, who's the chairman of the committee, says that the goal is not to condemn Islam as a religion or American Muslims as a group. But he says the hearings are designed to limit the threat of terrorism. And he also believes they're important to America's safety. REP. PETER KING, (R) NEW YORK: Let me make it clear today, that I remain convinced that these hearings must go forward and they will. To back down would be a craven surrender to political correctness and an abdication of what I believe to be the main responsibility of this committee: to protect America from a terrorist attack. LANCE: One of the people who testified during yesterday's hearings was Representative Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to the U.S. Congress. He acknowledged that some Muslims are responsible for violent actions. But he said you can't blame an entire community for the evil of some individuals. He got especially emotional talking about a Muslim paramedic and police cadet who died trying to help others during the 9/11 terrorist attacks. REP. KEITH ELLISON, (D) MINNESOTA: Mohammed Salman Hamdani was a fellow American who gave his life for other Americans. His life should not be identified as just as a member of an ethnic group or just a member of a religion, but as an American who gave everything for his fellow Americans. Bullying Prevention . LANCE: Bullying has been a big topic in the news recently. And yesterday, President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama hosted the first ever White House Conference on Bullying Prevention. Parents and students got together to talk about the effects of bullying and how to stop it in school and online. Ed Henry, our senior White House correspondent, has more on that event. (BEGIN VIDEO) ED HENRY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: President Obama using this first-ever White House anti-bullying summit as a forum to try to bring attention to this very, very difficult issue and say, look, for too long there have been students all around the country who have just accepted it, that they were going to get picked on, that they were going to be bullied, be the subject of assaults and violence and that it was sort of a rite of passage for kids. The president says that given all these tragic incidents where some kids have committed suicide over bullying, he says it's time for all of this to end, for schools to have higher standards. And he and the first lady have used various social media tools like Facebook to bring that message directly to students, to report some of these bullying incidents, for example. The president used his forum at the White House to say that even he as a kid was bullied. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: As adults, we all remember what it was like to see kids picked on in the hallways or in the schoolyard. And I have to say, with big ears and the name that I have, I wasn't immune. I didn't emerge unscathed. But because it's something that happens a lot, and it's something that's always been around, sometimes we've turned a blind eye to the problem. We've said, ""Kids will be kids."" And so, sometimes we overlook the real damage that bullying can do, especially when young people face harassment day after day, week after week. HENRY: So the bottom line is, the key moving forward is going to be, will there actually be some action to back up some of the talk at this summit. Ed Henry, CNN, the White House. (END VIDEO) Wisconsin Showdown . LANCE: The showdown in Wisconsin may be over. The anger is not. This started with Republican Governor Scott Walker's budget proposal that would limit negotiating rights for workers' unions. Fourteen Democratic state Senators fled the state so that there wouldn't be enough people there to pass the bill. On Wednesday, Republicans took out all the parts of the bill that had to do with the budget. Voting on non-budget bills requires less people, so the reduced negotiating rights passed. Protesters at the capitol yesterday started pounding on the windows. That forced police to put the building in lockdown! They closed the capitol and forcibly removed anyone inside who wouldn't leave.

THOMAS ANDRES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's first Shoutout goes out to Mr. Govern's social studies classes at Riceville Community High School in Riceville, Iowa! What is the smallest type of bird? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it the: A) Finch, B) Sparrow, C) Egret or D) Hummingbird? You've got three seconds -- GO! Hummingbirds are the smallest; even the largest variety is only about 8 inches long. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! ""Hummingbird"" Drones . LANCE: Imagine if the military had a vehicle that was as small as a hummingbird. Definitely wouldn't be able to fit a pilot in there. But that's actually the point. We're talking about drones, aircraft that someone flies by remote control. The U.S. military has used drones for years. Chris Lawrence is going to show us one right now that could bring big changes to the battlefield. (BEGIN VIDEO) CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Imagine a drone as small as a hummingbird; same shape, same sound. Wait, don't imagine. It's here in this California lab. MATT KEENNON, AEROVIRONMENT PROJECT MANAGER: It looks more or less like an indigenous small bird, and it can fly through small clearings and through trees and seeing inside. LAWRENCE: AeroVironment's Matt Keennon says this is how the bird sees us from above. Right now, the hummingbird can only fly a little bit longer than 10 minutes. But at that size, imagine what it could do in 10 hours. The Defense Department has spent $4 million with that dream in mind: American troops armed with an unmanned vehicle that blends into the other birds or insects in a given country. KEENNON: The operator hovers the aircraft around until it finds an opening. LAWRENCE: Perhaps even buzz into a room, drop a payload and leave. But most unmanned vehicles, the hummingbird included, still depend on man to control their cameras or movements. LT. GEN. DAVID DEPTULA, U.S. AIR FORCE (RETIRED): But that's a vulnerability. That can be interrupted. That can be hacked. LAWRENCE: Retired General David Deptula says future enemies will cut the operator's connection unless drones become more autonomous. He says sure, drones have worked in Iraq and Afghanistan, because there's very few missiles to shoot them down. DEPTULA: But if you fly these same vehicles where there is an air defense, those MQ-1 Predators and MQ-9 Reapers would be falling from the sky like rain. LAWRENCE: Compared to other drones, the hummingbird has a six-inch wing span and weighs less than a AA battery. But the designer needs to add intelligence to its small size. KEENNON: It could be much more useful if the aircraft could keep itself safe. LAWRENCE: If so, the military has designs beyond battle. It envisions the bird helping to find victims, weaving through crevices created by an earthquake. (END VIDEO) Shoutout Extra Credit . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for a Shoutout Extra Credit!

"(CNN) -- The man who shot officers inside a Detroit police station had a relative who is scheduled to be sentenced for double homicide Monday, said the city's police chief, who would not confirm that as the motive behind the attack. ""We can't speculate as to motive,"" Chief Ralph Godbee said in a news conference Monday. ""There is nothing in this that makes sense at all."" Lamar Deshea Moore, 38, walked into a police precinct Sunday and ""indiscriminately began firing,"" Godbee said. He was shot and killed by return gunfire from police, according to the chief. Two of the four officers wounded in the shooting were hospitalized in stable condition Monday, Godbee said.  Cmdr. Brian Davis is recovering from a gunshot wound to back, and Sgt. Brian Anderson was grazed in the head, he said. Sgt. Ray Saati also was grazed in the head. He and Sgt. Carrie Schultz have been treated and released from the hospital.  Schultz was shot in the chest, but was protected by a bulletproof vest, according to police. The shooting has led to the reassessment of security measures by police officials. According to the chief, Mayor Dave Bing has committed to bringing in resources necessary to provide a safe environment, and interim measures will be put in place. ""We will do whatever is necessary to provide an environment for our officers that is safe,"" Godbee said, but he wouldn't specify any immediate changes. The chief said his office will be presenting the mayor with recommendations of security protocols that are ""reflective of the reality that we have to live with every day."" Officers involved in the attack were praised for their bravery. ""Through it all, our officers maintained courageous calm,"" he said. ""They returned fire, they took cover, they did all the things we train them to do under pressure."" Counseling will be provided for officers affected by the shootings, said the chief. Meanwhile, efforts to find a motive for the shooting continues. Godbee said the police plan to speak with members of Moore's family and friends to see whether they can provide any helpful information.","Two of the wounded officers are in stable condition, police chief says .

"(CNN) -- Courtney Hight told herself not to cry as police handcuffed her outside the White House. ""I knew I was doing the right thing,"" she said. ""So I did not cry."" On a cloudy day last month Hight, a former member of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, took a huge career risk and joined more than 1,200 protesters who were demanding that President Obama deny a building permit for Keystone XL, a planned oil pipeline that would stretch from Alberta, Canada, to Texas. The project, the protesters say, threatens to poison ground water across the heartland and extend America's reliance on climate-changing fossil fuels. Pipeline owners, Alberta-based TransCanada, say the project will pose no ground water risk and will provide jobs and decreased U.S. dependence on Mideast oil. A final decision on the permit is expected by the end of this year. Since the pipeline was first proposed, Obama has said the decision rests with the State Department, but Hight and others point out that the president has the power to make the final call. Hight, 32, worked as a grassroots student organizer. She joined Obama's campaign in 2007, rising to a position of Florida's youth vote director. For her and many other participants, the protest outside the White House represented a deeply personal threshold they'd never before crossed: ""It was the first time I'd ever remotely said anything critical of the president,"" she said. Many other Obama supporters have found themselves critical of the president's environmental policies. A big reason why Hight and other environmentalists, including former Vice President Al Gore, find themselves aligned against Obama goes back to his 2008 nomination speech when he pledged to fight the affects of climate change. ""I am absolutely certain that generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children that ... this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal,"" Obama said during the speech. ""That's great poetry, but it's not true anymore,"" says Joseph Romm, who served as acting assistant secretary of energy during the Clinton administration. ""There's no question there's been a shift in what he campaigned on and what he has done -- most specifically in the area of climate change, but in other areas like air pollution."" What Obama could do to help slow the rise of the oceans . It's a tough political climate for supporters of clean energy alternatives, such as solar or wind power. Almost every issue in Washington -- including the environment -- is overshadowed by concerns about the struggling economy and unemployment. Fossil fuel industries, blamed by many for climate change, are creating jobs and bolstering economies in the heartland and the Northeast. ""We still are suffering from a lack of an energy policy that can deal both with our environmental challenges, but also our economic challenges,"" Obama said during a Democratic National Committee event last month. Cody Pedigo, a 30-year-old welder in Bowling Green, Kentucky, understands the challenge, and he has a lot riding on the White House's decision about the pipeline. ""I want to see oil production, but I do care about the environment and I think there's a lot of ways we can work both of them together,"" said Pedigo, who is between jobs and with his wife Cherry is raising two boys, Jacob, 9 and Joshua, age 6. The country has been burning oil for a long time, he said, ""and it ain't going to change overnight."" He's very confident that he'll be able to snag a job on the project if it's green-lighted. ""Financially, what a job on the Keystone pipeline would do for me is get me out of more debt and help me lower my monthly bills,"" says Pedigo, a third-generation pipe-liner who's been welding since age 18. Environmentalists say Obama reneges on promises . Environmentalists were incensed last month when Obama decided to delay tougher ozone air pollution standards until at least 2013. The president's decision threatens the health of children, the elderly and victims of chronic lung diseases, the American Lung Association said. Some of the president's supporters reacted harshly to the ozone standards decision, Gore who posted on his blog that ""Obama appears to have bowed to pressure from polluters"" who fear the cost of following tougher air pollution standards. Gene Karpinski of the League of Conservation Voters -- which endorsed Obama in 2008 -- said the administration was ""caving"" to industry and the president's decision was a choice to ""punt."" Former Obama campaign staffer Elijah Zarlin, who also was arrested at the protest at the White House, said the president is ""missing an opportunity to lead this country in a better direction."" The White House insisted the delay wasn't political, but rather a need for further scientific study before implementing new rules, which would have cost 7.3 million jobs by 2020, said the Manufacturers Alliance. The American Petroleum Institute told the Wall Street Journal that the White House is ""beginning to understand that the regulatory burden does more to chill job creation than just about anything else out there."" The White House declined to directly respond to specific questions about Obama's environmental stance, but spokesman Clark Stevens, in a written statement for this story, strongly defended the president's record. ""In just a few years the Obama administration has put in place some of the most important public health protections since the passage of the Clean Air Act, achieved historic fuel economy standards that will save billions of barrels of oil and over a trillion dollars for families, while also expanding the clean energy economy, creating jobs, keeping America competitive, and putting our country on track to double renewable energy generation from sources like wind and solar in the president's first term,"" Clark wrote. Will the pipeline create jobs? Building the pipeline will directly create 13,000 construction jobs and indirectly generate 7,000 construction jobs, according to Ray Perryman of the Perryman Group, which TransCanada hired to provide an economic analysis of the project. Imagine 1,500 well-paid workers coming into any community and spending their money at stores, restaurants, motels, trailer parks and apartments, says Danny Hendrix of the Pipeliner's Union local 798 out of Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""It's like the circus coming to town -- but they stay,"" Hendrix said. But pipeline and community officials agree the project will leave very few permanent jobs. The lasting benefit from Keystone XL, says TransCanada spokesman Jim Prescott, would be greater economic stability in the U.S. energy sector by providing a reliable flow of about 1.1 million daily barrels of Canadian and U.S. oil to Texas refineries. An onshore pipeline would be less likely to be interrupted by hurricanes than oil delivered by oil tankers or from offshore oil rigs, Prescott said. ""That keeps thousands of workers at those refineries employed."" Does clean energy kill jobs? The Perryman Group estimates that some $5 billion of the pipeline's $7 billion total price would be spent on direct construction costs, such as materials and labor. That $5 billion -- if invested in clean energy production such as wind or solar power -- would generate slightly more jobs, says economist Heidi Garrett-Peltier of University of Massachusetts' Political Economy Research Institute and the Center for American Progress, an influential liberal think tank. Solar panel maker Solyndra went bankrupt last month despite receiving about a half billion dollars in federal loan guarantees initiated by the administration. A top energy official with the program has resigned in the wake of criticism. Ex-staffer: Obama needs to be 'the guy that he was' So now, the green movement is putting the White House on notice. The next three to six months present a ""very critical time"" for the relationship between Obama and environmentalists, says League of Conservation Voters' Karpinski. Many of Hight's former colleagues she met during the '08 Obama campaign say they're frustrated by the White House environmental track record so far. ""There is an element of feeling something owed,"" she says. ""He made a promise. This was a big promise that he talked a lot about. And now he risks letting them down."" The green community, advocates say, will be watching. Along with the pipeline, three other looming questions could serve as tests for the president's commitment to the environment. -- How hard will Obama fight in Congress for proposed EPA rules to regulate mercury and other toxic pollution from power plants? -- Will Obama consistently stand up and block efforts in Congress to limit the EPA's authority? -- How hard will Obama fight to establish the EPA's first-ever standards for greenhouse gas emissions from power plants? But the giant green issue for many will be the pipeline. ""It's going to influence a lot of people,"" says Romm. ""The cumulative weight of all these decisions will."" Bill McKibben, a top organizer of the White House sit-in, calls it ""gut check time"" for the president. ""It's time for him to do some heroic things on the environment."" As ex-Obama campaign staffer Zarlin put it, ""If he's going to win the election, I think he needs to get back to that guy that he was.""","Green advocates worry Obama softening on environment .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu turned 80 on Friday, days after a spat with the government over a visa delay that forced the Dalai Lama to cancel a trip to the nation. Tutu celebrated Thursday by dancing with the Soweto Gospel Choir during a church celebration to mark his birthday. Music and laughter rang out in the cathedral during the event attended by Irish rocker Bono of U2. The Dalai Lama had hoped to deliver birthday greetings personally but scrapped his planned visit after South Africa failed to issue him a visa in time. Instead, the Tibetan spiritual leader wished Tutu well in a webcast. ""Please take care,"" the Dalai Lama said. ""I will pray both to god as well as Buddha for your long life and healthy body."" ""I am quite sad,"" he said. ""And also this time, I was very much hoping to see Nelson Mandela, (who is) now very old. Now I have doubt whether I will have the occasion to meet Nelson Mandela or not."" Mandela turned 93 this year. Tutu lashed out at his government Tuesday, saying it had forgotten what the nation stood for. ""When we used to apply for passports under the apartheid government, we never knew until the last moment what their decision was,"" Tutu said at a news conference. ""Our government is worse than the apartheid government because at least you were expecting it from the apartheid government. The Dalai Lama had been invited to the country to receive a peace award and speak at various events, including a lecture in honor of Tutu's birthday. Tutu and the Dalai Lama are recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize. South Africa denies the visa was linked to pressure from China, a major trade partner. The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, and the nation pressures governments worldwide to deny him any legitimacy. Despite the setback, tributes came in early Friday for the man known fondly as ""the people's priest"" and hailed for his fight for human rights. In a birthday message, the U.S. Embassy in South Africa said he ""continues to provide a moral voice for the voiceless."" ""We congratulate Archbishop Desmond Tutu ... and join South Africa and the global community in honoring a man who is recognized for his fearlessness in speaking truth to power,"" the embassy in Pretoria said in a statement. ""From his work against apartheid in South Africa, to his championing of democracy, freedom and human rights, and advocacy for those still living under the scourge of homophobia, racism or xenophobia, Archbishop Tutu has served as the vocal conscience of a generation."" This is not the first time the Dalai Lama has not been able to visit South Africa. Two years ago, South Africa refused the Tibetan spiritual leader a visa to attend an international peace conference, saying it was not in the country's interest for him to attend. CNN's Kim Norgaard contributed to this report.","NEW: The Dalai Lama wishes Tutu well and says he is sad about his canceled trip .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- A strong 6.5-magnitude earthquake hit southern Mexico on Saturday night, killing two people and startling residents as far away as Mexico City, state media reported. It struck in Guerrero state at 7:47 p.m. local time, about 100 miles south-southwest of the capital, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The agency had previously put the quake's magnitude at 6.7. One person was killed when a rock fell on a vehicle, while another was crushed by a collapsed house, the state-run Notimex news agency reported, citing civil protection officials in Guerrero. At least 50 homes were damaged and at least four people were injured there, Notimex said. There were no immediate reports of major damage in the capital, but several areas were without power, Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard wrote on his Twitter page soon after the quake. Some startled residents in Mexico City ran out of their houses and into the streets. Loud sirens sounded after the quake, which had an estimated depth of 40 miles, the USGS said. Lorena Isla, a CNN iReporter in San Jeronimo Lidice, on the outskirts of Mexico City, took video of chandeliers swaying at her home. The side-to-side movement of the earthquake lasted about three minutes, said Isla, who lives on the third floor of a residence. ""This was the strongest one I ever felt,"" she said late Saturday. She took the video and rushed outside, where she said she fainted. ""Everybody is in panic,"" Isla said. Authorities urged residents to turn off natural gas devices. Some were having a hard time reaching relatives because of cell phone disruptions, according to Isla.

"(CNN) -- A bus carrying students and faculty from Abilene Christian University to a weekend mission project overturned Friday afternoon near Paint Rock, Texas, resulting in one death and multiple injuries, the school said. Grant Rampy, director of public relations for the university in Abilene, said the bus was headed to a children's home in Medina in south-central Texas. The crash occurred about 3:20 p.m. on U.S. 83 in Runnels County, the Texas Department of Public Safety said in a statement. The driver lost control and the bus struck a concrete culvert and rolled once, authorities said. Several students were ejected. Authorities said Anabel Reid, 19, of Petersburg, Texas, was pronounced dead at the scene. A number of helicopters were brought in to fly the injured to area hospitals, Rampy said. The victims had varying degrees of injury. The 2009 bus, registered to the university, is equipped for 24 passengers and a driver, officials said. The school's website said that 12 students, three faculty members and the spouse of one faculty member were on board. They were representing the Department of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. The Department of Public Safety said 16 people were on the bus. Top leaders in the university administration traveled to four hospitals to be with families.

Welcome to CNN Student News. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Today's show goes out to all of our CNN librarians and to all of you librarians and media specialists out there. Happy National Library Week. Now, let's get to the headlines. First Up: Deficit Plan . AZUZ: First up, President Obama announces the details of his plan to lower the country's deficit. It includes a mixture of spending cuts and tax increases. The White House says the president's plan will cut the deficit by $4 trillion over the next 12 years. Republicans have outlined their own plan. It would cut about the same amount from the deficit, but in very different ways. Republican leaders have criticized the president's plan, especially the idea of increasing government revenue by raising taxes on wealthy Americans. House Speaker John Boehner says the government doesn't have a revenue problem, it has a spending problem. During his speech yesterday, President Obama said he doesn't expect everyone to agree, but he does hope they can find a way to work together. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I don't expect the details in any final agreement to look exactly like the approach I laid out today. This is a democracy; it's not how things work. I'm eager to hear other ideas from all ends of the political spectrum. And though I'm sure the criticism of what I've said here today will be fierce in some quarters, and my critique of the House Republican approach has been strong, Americans deserve and will demand that we all make an effort to bridge our differences and find common ground. Is This Legit? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The Latin word ""fauna"" refers to a region's plant life. Nope. Not true! ""Flora"" refers to a region's natural plant life while ""fauna"" refers to animal life. Gulf Wildlife Report . AZUZ: There's a new report out looking at the status of the fauna from the U.S. Gulf Coast region. One year after the devastating BP oil spill, the National Wildlife Federation classifies the coast's wetlands as ""poor."" Some of the problems were around before the spill: erosion, storms. But the spill -- the worst in U.S. history -- made the situation worse. According to the report, around 3,000 miles of coast were contaminated by oil. And even the clean-up efforts can cause damage. As for the animals that call the area home, sea turtles and bluefin tuna were some of the species that were hit pretty hard. They were both given a condition of ""poor."" It's not all bad news, though. Brown pelicans and dolphins in the Gulf both have a ""good"" status. And the report says shrimp are recovering fairly well, too. Gas Prices & Politics . AZUZ: Drive past a gas station and you might just wince. Gas prices are high, and they keep going up! The national average for a gallon of regular unleaded was $3.81 yesterday. That is an increase of 24 percent from the start of this year. Lisa Sylvester is going to explain what's behind the rising prices and their impact on the political world. (BEGIN VIDEO) LISA SYLVESTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Coast to coast, from Atlanta to New York to Los Angeles, consumers are getting socked by high gas prices. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: $4.19 a gallon, that's ridiculous. It's absolutely absurd. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I have to drive, and they don't pay mileage. So, it's really, really sticking me. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, they're getting all the bailouts and the breaks, and we're getting squeezed. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's L.A., so it's even worse. SYLVESTER: Why are oil prices shooting upward now? The fighting in Libya is one contributing factor. Fears of unrest spreading to other countries in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, also has markets on edge. And, economists say, factoring in speculation and an increase in demand from countries like China. Higher gas prices hit consumers where it hurts most: discretionary spending. PETER MORICI, ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND: Consumers really feel a pinch. They are limited in their discretion because they have to pay their mortgage, they have to pay their utilities. So, to pay higher gas prices, they go out to dinner less, they go to movies less, they buy fewer clothes. The amount of money that most consumers have to work with is very limited. SYLVESTER: Gas prices are expected to continue to rise through the spring. The spike in prices is not just a pocketbook issue, it's also a political one. KEN VOGEL, POLITICO: There is not a lot of evidence that anything that political leaders are doing in the short term has as much impact on gas prices as market trends or long-term energy policy. But that doesn't stop politicians of both parties from pointing the finger at each other. SYLVESTER: The issue is already playing out like a campaign ad. Republicans are blaming President Obama. Democrats pushing back, pointing to Republicans' cozy ties with the oil and gas industry. (END VIDEO) Teens and Music . AZUZ: You've probably heard this before: Music is one of those things that can define a generation. But new research suggests that the music you're listening to might also define your state of mind. This study looked at teens who listen to a lot of music. By a lot, we mean four to five hours a day. And the research says those teens may be at a higher risk for depression. Scientists also looked into other forms of media. Teens who read more have a lower risk of depression. And TV doesn't seem to have much of an effect. The study's author recognized that some teens might use music for comfort. So, it raises the question: Do people listen to more music when they're sad? Or can listening to a lot of music lead you to be sad? Blog Promo . AZUZ: You know this is something we're talking about on our blog at CNNStudentNews.com. When we get a story like this one, that's really about you, we want to know what you think. When you're feeling down, do you find that listening to music is more helpful or harmful? Put some thought into it, let us know your opinions. This Day in History . AZUZ: It's April 14th, and on this day in history: In 1828, after more than two decades of work, Noah Webster published the first edition of his American Dictionary. In 1865, President Abraham Lincoln was shot by John Wilkes Booth while attending a play at Ford's Theatre. Lincoln died the following morning. And in 1986, the U.S. launched air strikes against Libya. This was in response to Libya supporting terrorism against American troops and citizens. Before We Go . AZUZ: Another event happened on this day in history back in 1910: President William Howard Taft threw out the first ball at the Washington Senators' home opener. With that flick of the wrist, he started the tradition of presidents tossing out the first pitch. Some of them threw from the stands, some from the mound. As we look back at this century-old tradition before we go today, see how many of these presidential pitchers you can recognize. (BEGIN VIDEO) [MUSIC; CLIPS OF PRESIDENTIAL FIRST PITCHES] .

"(CNN) -- Two of the biggest teams in world cycling are to merge next season, with the news that Lance Armstrong's RadioShack squad and Luxembourg outfit Leopard-Trek are to join forces. The new team, which will be called RadioShack-Nissan-Trek, have secured sponsorship for a two-year period and will continue to be licenced in Luxembourg. A formidable line-up of 30 riders will be confirmed later this month, which will contain Leopard's Schleck brothers Andy and Frank -- who finished second and third in this year's Tour de France -- and world time-trial champion Fabian Cancellara. Other high-profile riders will include American Chris Horner, Germany's Andreas Kloden, Jani Brajkovic of Slovenia, Jakob Fuglsang of Denmark and Italy's Daniele Bennati. Team chief Johan Bruyneel announced the news on the official RadioShack website, saying: ""With our sponsors' continuing commitment and the professionalism of our riders, I'm confident that RadioShack-Nissan-Trek will dominate cycling for years to come. ""With Team RadioShack, we won 30 races and dominated the most important American races in 2011. Now thanks to the presence of riders like Fabian Cancellara and the Schleck brothers, we now have the potential to win not only Classics and major stage races but Grand Tours as well. ""We are grateful our sponsors believe in this project. This is a great milestone for our team and our global sport."" Both teams are relatively new to the peloton, with RadioShack forming in 2010 around seven-time Tour de France champion Armstrong, while Leopard was set up last year and spearheaded by the Schleck brothers. The merger will free up an extra place in the 18-team Pro Tour elite section following the recent demise of HTC-Highroad and another merger between Belgian squads Omega-Pharma and QuickStep. However, one of those places is expected to be taken up by the new Australian outfit Green Edge, who have just announced the signing of top sprinter Matt Goss as one of their leaders.","RadioShack and Leopard teams to merge for 2012 season .

"(CNN) -- England captain Lewis Moody has dismissed suggestions his team have been handed an easy draw for the group stage of the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand. Moody, 33, is out of his team's opening match with Argentina in Dunedin on Saturday, as England look to reach a third successive World Cup final and repeat their victorious campaign at Australia 2003. Argentina, who finished third at the 2007 tournament in France, look set to present Martin Johnson's team with their toughest test of the opening round, with England's archrivals Scotland and minnows Georgia and Romania making up the rest of Pool B. ""No, there's no such thing,"" the Flanker told CNN when asked if his team's group was easy. ""There really isn't, I mean people will say that but it's certainly not the case. ""Argentina finished third in the last World Cup, Scotland have beaten South Africa ... We have a very big challenge in this tournament and first is making sure that we come out of the group in as strong a position as we can against tough opposition. ""You know it's just great that every nation that's involved in this World Cup is really lifting their standards and you know that every game you're going to be playing is going to be tough."" The 2011 World Cup will see Russia make their debut at the quadrennial competition, and Moody is convinced the sport's continued expansion into new territories bodes well for the future. ""More people are getting involved and will take it [rugby] back to their countries and, if they've done well, they will have all that support and it will grow their fan base in those countries,"" Mooday added. ""It's great for the sport."" Moody has already been a world champion once in his career, as part of the team which, captained by current coach Johnson, defeated hosts Australia to lift the Webb-Ellis trophy in 2003. Along with fly-half Jonny Wilkinson, who kicked the drop goal which won the final eight years ago, Moody is one of only two 2011 World Cup squad members who played in that historic match in Sydney. ""I remember being very nervous for a vast majority [of the final] because I was sat on the bench and all your anticipation, your anxieties, they are all with you until step across that white line on the pitch. ""When I did get on, I remember Ben Kay calling the line out with a minute to go with me at the back and, thankfully, Steve Thompson threw it, I caught it, the ball went to Matt Dawson and the rest is history. ""Dawson managed to get the ball to Jonny, who then kicked the drop goal. It was an incredible occasion and one that will stick with you for very fond reasons.""","Lewis Moody tells CNN there are no easy games at the Rugby World Cup .

"(CNN) -- England's Courtney Lawes was handed a two-match ban on Tuesday after he was found guilty of recklessly striking his opponent with a knee during his country's opening match of the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Lawes, 22, made the tackle on Argentina's Mario Ledesma during England's 13-9 victory in Pool B on Saturday.

""Taking into account mitigating factors being his excellent disciplinary record and remorse and the absence of aggravating factors, the Player was suspended for two weeks. ""In the context of the Rugby World Cup Tournament a week equates to one match. Therefore Lawes is suspended for two Rugby World Cup matches."" Lawes made his England debut in November 2009, in an 18-9 defeat to Australia at Twickenham, and now has nine caps.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Former NBA guard Javaris Crittenton waived his first appearance before a judge Friday as he faces murder charges in the death of an Atlanta mother. He had arrived in Atlanta the previous night, extradited from California, where he was arrested. Only his attorney appeared before Magistrate Judge Maureen Malone on Friday. The 23-year-old former basketball player's next court date is September 30, Fulton County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Tracy Flanagan said. He will remain in Fulton County Jail in the meantime. Crittenton is charged with homicide murder, felony murder and intent to commit aggravated murder, Flanagan said. He was arrested in late August at John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, on a fugitive warrant. Atlanta investigators say Julian Jones, 22, was killed in a drive-by shooting August 19. The mother of four may not have been the target of the shooting, Atlanta police told CNN affiliate WSB. Police believe Crittenton may have been targeting a man who stole jewelry from him. Jones was walking with two men when she was shot, the affiliate reported. Police believe one of the men with her was the target, the affiliate reported. Crittenton, who played for Georgia Tech before going professional, was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers in 2007 and then traded to the Memphis Grizzlies. He was picked up by the Washington Wizards in December 2008, but he was suspended and later released by the NBA in 2010 after a gun-related incident involving teammate Gilbert Arenas.","Javaris Crittenton waives first appearance before a judge .

"(CNN) -- Rugby World Cup hosts New Zealand ran in 13 tries as they recorded a commanding 83-7 victory over Japan in Hamilton on Friday. The Pool A match was all but over by half-time, with the All Blacks registering six unanswered tries to head into the interval at the Waikato Stadium with a 38-0 advantage. With their second triumph of the tournament assured, Graham Henry's team continued to press in the second period and added a further seven tries to complete a resounding success. Japan, who have participated in every edition of the World Cup and are coached by former New Zealand wing John Kirwan, had little reason to cheer, but did manage to touch down beyond the All Blacks' line in the second half through Hirotoki Onozawa. The result left New Zealand top of their group, with a maximum 10 points from their two games so far. For Japan, this was their second-straight defeat, after a 47-21 reverse against France, and they sit bottom of Pool A. New Zealand wasted no time in opening the scoring, center Conrad Smith grabbing the game's first try after just three minutes. The floodgates then opened as wing Richard Kahui, flanker Jerome Kaino and hooker Kevin Mealamu all went over to put the home side 22-0 ahead inside the first half an hour. The Brave Blossoms were struggling to cope with the All Blacks, who are searching for a first world crown since 1987, and conceded two more tries before half time as both scrumhalf Andy Ellis and flyhalf Colin Slade, who also kicked 18 points in the match, both got in on the act. New Zealand's pressure was relentless and after the break Kahui ran over for his second try of the match before center Sonny Bill Williams scored his first of the game. Wing Isaia Toeava made the score 59-0 to New Zealand before Japan finally mustered a response through Onozawa's converted try. Four more tries followed for New Zealand before the final whistle; hooker Andrew Hore, Ma'a Nonu and flanker Adam Thomas all contributing to the runaway score. Williams' second try minutes from the end completed the rout for New Zealand, who will head into their September 24 clash with France, the team who eliminated them at the quarterfinal stage of the 2007 tournament, full of confidence. Japan will continue their bid to advance beyond the pool stage of a World Cup for the first time against Tonga on Wednesday.","New Zealand thrash Japan 83-7 at the Rugby World Cup .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Life after the military can be tough for many war veterans who struggle to adjust to life after combat. John Raftery accepts his Veteran Entrepreneur of the Year award. But a scheme at The Whitman School of Management at Syracuse University aims to provides business training for U.S. war veterans that will make that transition easier. The Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans with Disabilities (EBV) teaches valuable skills that enable veterans to become self-employed and make their business ideas viable. The EBV was the brainchild of Mike Haynie, a military veteran who spent 14 years in the air force before becoming an entrepreneurship professor at Syracuse, where his Dean is a Vietnam veteran. ""Self-employment is a powerful path forward for people with disabilities, who may not have a way to plug in to traditional jobs,"" he told CNN. ""We recognized that this was an opportunity to teach entrepreneurship to serve those who have served all of us."" John Raftery, 30, was in the Marine Corps between 1999 and 2003. He left with post-traumatic stress disorder and told CNN that after leaving the military he endured a two-year ""desolate period"" when he was in and out of work. Raftery attended the first EBV at Syracuse in 2007. Two months later he quit his job and started his Dallas-based business Patriot Contractors, Inc. Patriot is now a thriving enterprise, with five employees and a projected revenue of $1 million for the year. He returned to Syracuse this year to collect the EBV's inaugural Veteran Entrepreneur of the Year award. ""It's been a lot of hard work but the program gave me the tools to do it,"" he told CNN. ""Coming out of the military you lose part of yourself. I was a Marine for so many years, and then I found myself back in the civilian world. The big thing about the course is that it gave me the confidence to go out and do it."" The courses are open to veterans with a ""service-connected disability"" who have served since September 2001. Haynie is proud of the fact that the program is funded entirely by donations from alumni and partner businesses with a stake in local communities. There is no charge for attending the program, but places are limited. Haynie said there were more than 400 applications this year for 115 places across the five schools, but there are hopes to expand the program. Former U.S. marine Joshua Pitcher is another beneficiary of the program. On his first tour of Iraq, with the Marines in 2005, Pitcher suffered a gunshot wound. He returned for a second tour, but in February 2007 his team came under attack from insurgents and a grenade exploded inches from his head. Surgeons in Iraq removed half his skull to relieve swelling in his brain, but the injury brought an end to his army career. Pitcher's bravery earned him two purple heart medals. Now 24 and living in New York State, he is trying to adjust to life after the military. Pitcher told CNN he has found an alternative career in furniture making and now has a workshop behind his house. Last week he attended his first session to help him on his way to building his furniture business. The EBV has three stages -- an online module where students get up to speed with business fundamentals, an intensive nine-day ""bootcamp"" at a university, and a year-long mentorship from the EBV and successful local entrepreneurs. Having completed stages one and two, Pitcher was impressed with the program. ""You learn a lot on the course,"" he told CNN. ""I had a business plan mostly set up before I went, but you're able to refine it, and that means you can actually hit the ground running when it's all done."" Syracuse University introduced the EBV in 2007. Since then the EBV Consortium of Schools has been launched and UCLA Anderson, Florida State University's College of Business, Mays Business School at Texas A&M University and Purdue University all run the EBV program developed by Syracuse. Elaine Hagan, executive director of Harold Price Center for Entrepreneurial Studies at UCLA Anderson School of Management, told CNN that veterans possess many of the qualities the school tries to instill in their MBA students, such as leadership, discipline and teamwork. Haynie told CNN that a key part of the EBV is to instill belief in the veterans. ""The program is designed not only to teach, but to inspire the students,"" he said. ""We bring in world-class faculty, entrepreneurs from all over the country and business leaders. We've had senators, congressmen and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies participate in the program. It's sends out the message to the veterans that we believe they can really do it.""","Marine Joshua Pitcher was wounded in Iraq and had to rethink his career .

"(CNN) -- There has been no change in NBA players' position in the face of an ultimatum from the owners as the two sides try to reach a collective bargaining agreement, the president of the players' association said Tuesday. ""There isn't any player that wants us to take a bad deal,"" Derek Fisher said. The league on Sunday gave the players' association until Wednesday afternoon to accept a deal after eight hours of meetings over the weekend. Fisher said Sunday that the offer was not acceptable, and he reiterated Tuesday that the players' association is holding firm. ""That doesn't mean we won't continue to negotiate,"" Fisher said at a news conference after a meeting of players representing all but one of the NBA's teams. NBA Commissioner David Stern has said the newest proposal gives players between 49% and 51% of revenues. If the players' association does not change its mind by Wednesday, the NBA will offer up another proposal -- one that offers players 47% of basketball revenues. The current proposal says that if the league exceeds certain revenue forecasts, the players would receive 51%. If it didn't, the share would fall to 49%. But Fisher said Sunday that ""there'd be no way in the world we'd ever get to 51%"" under the provisions. The players' association's executive director, Billy Hunter, told CNN sister network TBS that Tuesday's meeting was intended to spell out the details of the owners' proposal, which they were ""misunderstanding"" based on media reports that focused on the revenue sharing offer. Once they heard the details of the proposal, he said, ""they were all horrified by it."" He said it would ""decimate"" gains made by players in recent years. Hunter said he is likely to meet with Stern before the owners' deadline Wednesday to see if there was any movement in their position. Fisher, during the news conference, said the players are confident an agreement giving players a better deal would still be possible despite the owners' ultimatum. The NBA season has been canceled through at least November 30, and the two sides are hoping they can reach a resolution before more games are called off. Stern has said the 2010-2011 season was not profitable for most of the league's 30 owners, who want cost-cutting help from players. The league lost as much as $300 million last season, according to Stern. One of the battles has focused on the owners' rejection of calls by the players' union for an average $7 million player salary in the sixth year of a new labor deal. The current average salary is about $5 million. Other big issues include a fight over a move by owners to gain the bigger share of revenues and whether the NBA will strengthen its salary cap.

"(CNN) -- The struggle for women's rights against the backdrops of the Arab Spring and democratic progress in Africa will be recognized by this year's Nobel Peace Prize on Saturday, at a ceremony unlikely to repeat controversy seen last year. Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and Leymah Gbowee, a social worker and peace campaigner from the same country, will share the prize with Tawakkul Karman, an activist and journalist who this year played a key opposition role in Yemen. The three, chosen ""for their non-violent struggle for the safety of women and for women's rights to full participation in peace-building work,"" will be honored in Oslo, Norway, during a program of events that culminates on Sunday in a star-studded concert. All three will be interviewed by CNN's Jonathan Mann, a veteran of Nobel Peace Prize ceremonies, shortly after they receive their medals and $1.5 million in cash. The interviews and concert, hosted by actors Helen Mirren and Rosario Dawson, will be broadcast live online and mobile on CNN.com. Acts performing at the concert include David Gray, Jill Scott, rock band Evanescence and country duo Sugarland. Johnson Sirleaf, a 73-year-old Harvard graduate whose political resilience has earned her the nickname ""Iron Lady,"" became Africa's first democratically-elected female president in 2006, three years after decades of civil war ended. Crediting women with ending the conflict and challenging the dictatorship of former President Charles Taylor, she declared a zero-tolerance policy against corruption and made education compulsory and free for all primary-age children. Gbowee, 39, led a women's movement that protested the use of rape and child soldiers in Liberia's civil war. She mobilized hundreds of women to force delegates at 2003 peace talks to sign a treaty - at one point calling for a ""sex strike"" until demands were met. Read more about this year's Nobel Peace Prize winners . Although Karman, 32, emerged as an icon of change as Yemen was swept up in the tumult of the Arab Spring, the mother-of-three has long been active in campaigning for women and human rights. Karman, the first Arab woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize -- and one of its youngest recipients -- founded the rights group Women Journalists without Chains, and emerged as a key figure in protests against President Ali Abdullah Saleh's regime. While Johnson Sirleaf's Nobel achievement has stirred anger among Liberian political opponents who claim recent elections were rigged in her favour, this year's Nobel Peace Price is unlikely to attract the level of controversy seen in 2010. China and more than a dozen other countries, including Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran, boycotted the event over the decision to award the prize to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, a key figure in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Read more about the Nobel Peace Prize . Liu, who is serving an 11-year-sentence in a Chinese prison for what the government called ""inciting subversion of state power,"" was not allowed to travel to Norway to accept the prize, which China denounced as a ""political farce."" Awarded almost every year since 1901 (it has been halted during times of major international conflict) the Peace Prize has a history of contentious laureates. Previous winners include former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who won alongside Vietnamese revolutionary Le Duc Tho (who declined the award), and the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who won jointly with Israeli President Shimon Peres and former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. In 2009, the prize was awarded to U.S. President Barack Obama despite the fact he had spent less than one year in office. Two years earlier, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore was a joint recipient in recognition of work highlighting climate change. â€¢ Just hours after officially receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, this year's three co-laureates sit down with Jonathan Mann for an hour-long special interview. The interview will broadcast live on CNN International and CNN.com on Saturday at 1600 GMT (11 am ET) and repeated on Sunday at 0300 GMT (10 pm ET Saturday). â€¢ The concert in honor of the Nobel prize winners will be broadcast on CNN.com on Sunday between 1900-2000 GMT (2pm-3pm ET) and 2030-2130 GMT (3.30pm-4.30pm ET).","Three women to jointly receive the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A Palestinian man shot in the face with a tear gas canister during a West Bank demonstration died Saturday morning, according to protest organizers. Mustafa Tamimi, 28, was among dozens of protesters who gathered in the West Bank village of Nabi Saleh on Friday for a weekly protest against the encroachment of a nearby Israeli settlement. The protest turned violent when minor clashes erupted between Israeli military personnel and the protesters. During the fighting, an Israeli soldier shot him from a close range with a tear gas projectile in the face, according to protest organizer Jonathan Pollak. Tamimi was critically wounded and brought to an Israeli hospital for emergency treatment. A photo of the incident appears to show a projectile fired in his direction from the back of an Israeli military vehicle. Pollak, who serves as the spokesman for the Popular Struggle Coordination Committee that organizes the weekly protest, accused the Israeli military of acting ""in complete disregard"" of its own open fire regulations. In a statement to the media, Pollak, claimed that ""soldiers often shoot tear-gas projectiles directly at groups of protesters or individuals."" The Israeli military said Saturday it was investigating the incident and referred reporters to its statement Friday. In the statement, the military described the gathering in Nabih Saleh as a ""violent and illegal riot"" where protesters hurled rocks at Israeli security personnel who in turn responded with ""riot dispersal means.""","Mustafa Tamimi was among dozens of protesters who gathered in West Bank .

"(CNN) -- Unrest has spread across the Middle East and North Africa. Here's a look at what has happened -- and what is happening -- in various countries: . ALGERIA . Authorities in Algeria said Monday that they would lift a 20-year state of emergency in the ""coming days."" They acted after anti-government protesters chanting ""change the power!"" clashed with security forces in the capital over the weekend, witnesses said. The state of emergency was imposed in 1992 to quell a civil war that led to the deaths of what U.S. officials estimate to be more than 150,000 people. About 100 protesters were arrested during the protests in Algiers on Saturday, according to the opposition Algerian League for Human Rights. BAHRAIN . Protests were scheduled to take place Monday afternoon in the Persian Gulf nation of Bahrain, where at least three police officers and one demonstrator were injured in clashes Sunday, the state new agency reported. The injuries occurred during an attack on a police station during protests Sunday evening, the news agency said. After three officers were injured, police fired on protesters with rubber bullets, causing one injury, the news agency said. EGYPT . Unrest persisted in Egypt on Monday even after an 18-day revolution toppled longtime President Hosni Mubarak, who stepped down Friday. Egypt's banks remained closed Monday after protests by National Bank workers apparently drove out the head of the institution. The nation's stock market remained closed until further notice because of turmoil in the banking sector. In addition, current and former police officers continued a peaceful protest Monday in front of the Interior Ministry, saying they want higher pay, shorter hours, better benefits and more respect. And some police officers told reporters they were ordered to shoot protesters during demonstrations last week and threatened with prison if they did not. IRAN . Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched along Revolution Avenue in downtown Tehran on Monday, protesting the government of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, witnesses said. The wave of people remained largely silent as they walked toward the capital city's Azadi Square, though some clashes between security forces and demonstrators broke out in several parts of Tehran, according to witnesses. Security forces fired tear gas in some places and detained demonstrators in other areas of the city. The Iranian government rounded up activists last week after opposition leaders Mehdi Karrubi and Mir Hossein Moussavi called for supporters to gather at Azadi Square -- the site of mass protests by Iran's opposition movement after the disputed 2009 presidential elections. IRAQ . Thousands of people rallied this month in cities across the country, protesting rampant poverty, a 45% national unemployment rate and shortages of food, electricity and water. Most recently, hundreds of angry demonstrators took to the streets of Ramadi -- about 60 miles (100 kilometers) west of Baghdad -- to protest the government's inability to provide basic services. After the protests began, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki announced he would cut his salary in half amid the growing unrest over poor public services and water shortages. State television also reported this month that al-Maliki would not run for a third term when his current one expires in 2014. JORDAN . U.S. Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, traveled over the weekend to Jordan, where King Abdullah II swore in a new government last week following anti-government protests in his country. The new government has a mandate for political reform and is headed by a former general, with several opposition and media figures among its ranks. The appointment of new Prime Minister Marouf al Bakhit was seen as an attempt to shore up support among Jordan's Bedouin tribes -- the bedrock of the monarchy. Jordan's economy has been hard-hit by the global economic downturn and rising commodity prices, and youth unemployment is high, as it is in Egypt. Officials close to the palace have told CNN that Abdullah is trying to turn a regional upheaval into an opportunity for reform. LIBYA . There were calls made through Facebook for a day of peaceful demonstrations in Libya on Monday. The protests come in the shadow of leader Moammar Gadhafi, who has ruled the country for almost 40 years and had expressed support for former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak during the crisis there. It was not immediately clear Monday whether protests had taken place. PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES . Prime Minister Salam Fayyad's Cabinet submitted its resignations to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Monday, days after the announcement of new elections in September. The Palestinian Territories have not seen the same kind of demonstrations as in many Arab countries, but the government has been under criticism since Al-Jazeera published secret papers claiming to reveal some of the wide-ranging concessions Palestinian officials were prepared to make in negotiations with Israel. Negotiations have collapsed. Abbas' Palestinian Authority holds sway only over the West Bank. The militant Islamist movement Hamas controls Gaza. SYRIA . As protests heated up around the region, the Syrian government pulled back from a plan to withdraw some subsidies that keep the cost of living down in the country. President Bashar al-Assad also gave a rare interview to Western media, telling The Wall Street Journal for a January 31 article that he planned reforms that would allow for local elections and also included a new media law and more power for private organizations. A planned ""Day of Rage"" that was being organized on Facebook for February 5 failed to materialize, The New York Times reported. SUDAN . Demonstrators have clashed with authorities on several recent occasions in Sudan. Human Rights Watch has said that ""authorities used excessive force during largely peaceful protests on January 30 and 31 in Khartoum and other northern cities to call for an end to the National Congress Party rule and government-imposed price increases."" Witnesses said that security forces used pipes, sticks and tear gas to disperse protesters and that several were arrested, including 20 who remain missing. The Sudanese Embassy said that people in Sudan have the right to ""demonstrate as they wish"" but that ""some opportunists capitalize"" on incidents ""to inspire chaos or smear Sudan's image."" TUNISIA . The European Union's top foreign policy official, Catherine Ashton, met Monday with government and civil society leaders in Tunisia, the North African country where protests in December sparked unrest that has spread across North Africa and the Middle East. After weeks of demonstrations that started in December, longtime President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali fled the country. Since then, Italy has complained about a wave of migrants from Tunisia coming into its territory. YEMEN . Clashes broke out between pro- and anti-government protesters in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, for at least the third day in a row Monday. About 200 anti-government protesters were confronted by about 300 counter-demonstrators, and the two sides threw rocks at each other and brandished daggers and knives. Several protesters were arrested. On Sunday, hundreds of anti-government protesters marched toward the presidential palace, but were blocked by security forces. Protesters attempted to reach the palace on side streets, and riot police reportedly used force in attempting to disperse them. Human rights group Amnesty International condemned the use of force in a statement issued Monday. Clashes also erupted Friday night and Saturday. Yemen's Embassy in Washington said the opposition coalition had announced its intention to hold a dialogue with the administration. Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has been in power for 32 years and has pledged not to run for re-election when his current term ends in 2013.","The winds of unrest have sailed through North Africa and the Middle East .

"(CNN) -- The liberation of St. Louis begins now. Albert Pujols is leaving the city and you are free, dear people, to speak the truth. No longer do you have to cower. No longer do you have to worry about stern looks and furious retorts. No longer do you have to tiptoe around the mighty slugger and his Ruthian numbers, fearful that he might say to hell with riverboat casinos and go elsewhere, someplace warmer. No longer do you have to mindlessly utter the Cardinal company lines about all of Pujols' charity work and family life and what a wonderful person he is. With Thursday's news that Pujols has agreed to a 10-year, $254 million contract with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Cardinals officials, players and fans are finally permitted say what has gone unsaid far too long -- that Albert Pujols is a pain in the rear. I know. Albert loves kids. And puppies. And kids with puppies. He is a devout Christian who has written, ""My life's goal is to bring glory to Jesus."" His foundation raises large bundles of money to help kids with Down syndrome (and if you don't believe this, ask anyone associated with Pujols. They'll tell you. And tell you. And tell you.). He has never, apparently, drowned a dog or shot himself in the leg. Over the past 11 years, St. Louis' slugging infielder could do no wrong. And yes, it helped that he averaged 42 homers and 126 RBIs while leading the club to two World Series titles. And yet ... for the hundreds of people who work for the Cardinals, and for the majority of the thousands upon thousands of fans who have asked Pujols for an autograph or a handshake or the smallest of words, the three-time National League MVP is, well, terrible. Having now covered sports for 17 years, I've witnessed few professional athletes who show greater disrespect and outright disdain for loyalists than Pujols. He is a man who, during spring training, walks from station to station with his head down; who responds to ""Albert, we love you!"" not with a smile or a nod, but with cold nothingness. When people call his name, he almost never gazes up. When people ask for an autograph, he doesn't even bother with a ""Not now"" or ""Try me later."" Instead, he turns to devices that men such as Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent perfected in the recent decades -- the steel-faced, how-dare-you-even-talk-to-me, ignore-the-world two-step. It's not a problem that Pujols doesn't say much -- neither does Derek Jeter. It's not that Pujols is intense -- Jimmy Rollins is certainly right there with him. No, what rubs so many people wrongly is his frostiness. Or, as one longtime Cardinals usher told me last March, ""How about looking up at people when they talk to you? How about acknowledging that they exist?"" During the waning days of last spring training, I stood alongside Pujols' table during the annual Cardinals Autograph Day at Roger Dean Stadium in Jupiter, Florida. Admittedly, the event is one that no player enjoys; a contrived, goofy, strictly-for-the-benefit-of-the-fans labor of torturous obligation. Here is a direct, play-by-play transcript from the opening minutes: . Fan: ""Albert, great to meet you! You're my favorite player in the world!"" Pujols (not looking up): ""Thanks."" Fan 2: ""Albert, do you sign jerseys?"" Pujols: (not looking up): ""No."" Fan 2: ""Helmets?"" Pujols (not looking up): ""No."" Fan 3: ""Good luck this year, Albert. You deserve everything you get."" Pujols (not looking up): ""Uh-huh. Thanks."" Fan 4: ""Albert, my daughter loves you."" Pujols (not looking up): . Because of his endorsement deal with Upper Deck, Pujols signed only pictures and baseballs (every other player signed whatever was presented to him). To call him rude would be to personify an utter lack of emotion. Pujols wasn't rude -- he was absent. And yet, because baseball lathers itself in mythology, and because Pujols was St. Louis' Zeus, and because St. Louis clutches onto its ballplayers the way a 5-year-old clutches her American Girl doll, nothing negative could ever be said. Truth be told, inside the Cardinals' clubhouse Pujols was, on his best days, pleasantly present. When asked, younger players would praise his leadership skills because, frankly, that's what young players do. Yet with last season's arrival of the affable, open, intelligent Lance Berkman, members of the team were able to witness what genuine leadership looks like. Now, Pujols -- perhaps the most revered Cardinal since Stan Musial -- has pulled a LeBron James II, abandoning his adopted hometown when bigger bucks and a sniff of Hollywood came calling. Whereas once he had a chance to stand alongside Ted Williams and Mickey Mantle and George Brett and Cal Ripken Jr. as legends who spent their entire careers with one franchise, now he is but a nomad -- richer, without question, but shockingly smaller in stature. Though the idea of Pujols in an Angels uniform seems strange at this moment, our eyes will inevitably adjust. And in St. Louis, I believe, so will opinions. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Pearlman.","Albert Pujols is leaving the Cardinals, and St. Louis should be relieved, Jeff Pearlman says .

"(CNN) -- At 44 meters long (145 ft), Hemisphere is the largest sailing catamaran in the world. The makers of Hemisphere believe this is first catamaran superyacht to hit the water and could revolutionize the way people think about sailing. But you'll need deep pockets to afford this kind of luxury -- the ""supercat"" costs more than $250,000 a week to lease. It took more than three years for the first sketch of the vessel to become a reality. Hemisphere made her debut on the world stage last week with Monaco as the appropriately lavish backdrop. While it has taken longer than anticipated to build, those behind the project insist she is worth the wait. ""The level of finishing and luxury of Hemisphere brings her to the category of a superyacht,"" says chief naval architect Marc Van Peteghem. Peteghem believes those in the superyacht market are increasingly conscious of their environmental image and are turning to sailing vessels as a greener solution to luxury travel. He says the catamaran is far greener than motor boats, making the most of nature, rather than fuel, to move. Hemisphere's interior has been tailored specifically to the luxury market; 17 different types of granite have been used inside and 16 leather finishes have been applied, according to Burgess, the yacht's charterers. There are also five spacious ensuite cabins to accommodate passengers with the main cabin featuring complete 360-degree views. Hemisphere is decked out with a host of toys for the discerning seafarer to play with -- smaller speed boats to go water skiing and wake boarding, water scooters and diving gear, as well as a jacuzzi on the fly bridge. It also comes fully equipped with the latest in diving gear to make the most of the boat's shallow waters capabilities. The catamaran only has a draft of 3.1 meters, meaning it can explore areas previously out of bounds for superyachts.","At 44 meters long (145 ft), Hemisphere is largest sailing catamaran in the world .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Air Force admitted Thursday that it sent more sets of military personnel remains to a Virginia landfill than it originally acknowledged. Backtracking on initial information about how it handled the remains of American service members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Air Force now says the cremated body parts of hundreds of the fallen were burned and dumped in the landfill. Earlier, the Air Force said only a small number of body parts had been buried in a commercial landfill and claimed it would be impossible to make a final determination of how many remains were disposed of in that manner. The Washington Post broke the story Thursday, and the Air Force now confirms that body fragments linked to at least 274 fallen military personnel sent to the Dover Air Force Base Mortuary were cremated, incinerated and buried with medical waste. That procedure was in place between November 2003 and May 1, 2008. The Air Force also said that 1,762 body parts were never identified and also were disposed of, first by cremation, then by further incineration and then buried in a landfill. Congressman Rush Holt, D-New Jersey, Thursday accused the Pentagon of what he called ""willful blindness"" in not acting faster to identify and correct the problems and fully report them. ""For years, this has been handled unceremoniously and insensitively and, I would say, dishonorably,"" Holt said in a telephone interview. He said he had been asking the Pentagon for months about information about Dover, on behalf of a constituent whose husband was killed five years ago. ""They don't get it. They don't understand the degree of dishonor involved in all of this,"" Holt said. Last month, the Defense Department told the congressman that exact numbers could not be determined. ""Without individual case-by-case review, the exact number of Service-directed disposition of subsequent remains cannot be determined,"" said a fact sheet sent to Holt in November. ""It would require a massive effort and time to recall records and research individually."" When bodies are not intact -- for instance, in the aftermath of a crash or explosion -- a body may be released to the family before some parts have been identified by the Air Force Mortuary at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. Families can elect to be notified when parts are identified or leave it up to the military to dispose of them appropriately. Since the policy was changed in 2008, the unclaimed body parts are buried at sea. An earlier report found instances of mismanagement and inadequate accounting at Dover, noting that some body parts were missing from the mortuary and in one case an arm was sawed off so a body would fit in a casket. An independent group of experts is now investigating what happened at the mortuary and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has ordered the Air Force to look at how mortuary employees there were disciplined. Two civilians were transferred to other jobs and a military officer received a career-ending letter of reprimand. Holt pointed to how the United States spends millions each year searching for the remains of service members missing in action from previous wars, for instance in Southeast Asia. ""That makes us proud to be an American, that we would do that,"" Holt said. ""It is a level of response that honors our soldiers."" The mistakes at Dover send a different message, Holt said. ""It sends shudders to think that we engage in this kind of desecration."" But at the Pentagon, aides to Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Panetta is satisfied with how the Air Force responded in regard to the landfill policy and new information about how many of the American fallen were involved. ""I think the secretary is comfortable with the way the Air Force has handled this,"" said Pentagon spokesman Capt. John Kirby. And Kirby strongly pushed back against criticism by Rep. Holt. ""I don't think there is another federal agency in this town, I don't think there is another institution in this country,"" that understands more about how to properly treat the remains of fallen troops, said Kirby, tapping the briefing room table for emphasis. Kirby said the Air Force is establishing a call center (1-855-637-2583 or e-mail dover.pm@pentagon.af.mil) so families of the fallen can seek information. Until now, families may not have been informed if part of a loved ones remains had been burned and discarded with medical waste. Pentagon Press Secretary George Little said Panetta was aware of the new reports. ""The secretary supports the recent Air Force investigation and he wants to see all of this move forward in a way that allows the Air Force to do its work and to avoid the kinds of lapses we did witness, and those lapses were regrettable,"" Little said. Later Thursday the Air Force said it was ready to apologize to any family that objected to the disposition of a loved one's remains. ""We regret any additional grief to the families past practices may have caused,"" said Air Force Lt. Gen. Darrell Jones, deputy Air Force chief of staff. ""We are prepared to apologize. It causes great pain to know we have brought suffering to a family,"" Jones said. Jones said only nine people have contacted a hotline seeking information about body fragments that may have been cremated, then incinerated and finally dumped with medical waste in a landfill prior to 2008. Jones did not directly say that that now-abandoned policy was disrespectful. ""It is certainly not the way we would have done it, looking back,"" Jones said. ""That's why in 2008 when we saw that practice, we changed that practice."" He said that under current rules, body parts such as small fragments of soft tissue or bone are collected for ""retirement at sea,"" a respectful transfer of the remains to the ocean from a U.S. Navy ship. So far since 2008, he said, only 14 urns containing body fragments have been disposed of at sea.","Mortuary at Dover Air Force Base handles remains of returning war dead .

"(CNN) -- Taiwan's economy slumped 8.36 percent during the last three months of 2008, the government said Wednesday. People line up to receive $108 U.S. dollars worth of shopping vouchers in Taipei, Taiwan, last month. The island's economy spiraled into recession with its second straight quarter of economic losses. For the third quarter of 2008, Taiwan's real gross domestic product (GDP), adjusted for inflation, slipped about 1 percent, according to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. Behind the dismal economic numbers is a global recession that is sapping demand for the products Taiwan makes. ""The types of exports that Taiwan ships to the West -- electronics -- are very severely affected, very sensitive to changes in Western consumer sentiment,"" said Frederic Neumann, a senior Asian economist for HSBC. The GDP numbers are the broadest measure of Taiwan's economic activity. A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of falling GDP. Taiwan's central bank, in a move to boost the economy, on Wednesday dropped its key interest rate one-quarter point, to 1.25 percent. Since the end of 2007, the central bank has lowered rates by more than 2 percent. In January, the Taiwanese government offered the island's residents up to $108 each to go shopping, in another attempt to stimulate the economy. More than 90 percent of those eligible took up the offer, pumping about TW $86 billion ($2.6 billion) into the economy and sending shoppers to malls, officials said.","Taiwanese economy now in recession now after second straight quarter of losses .

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- The Florida A&M University Board of Trustees reprimanded the school's president Thursday for his actions in the aftermath of the suspected hazing-related death of a 26-year-old drum major. The trustees also voted to allocate money to hire a public relations firm to represent the board during the hazing controversy. By an 8-4 vote, the board chose to reprimand President James Ammons instead of putting him on administrative leave as administrators have done to the band's director, Julian White. During the board meeting, FAMU Trustee Rufus Montgomery proposed administrative leave for Ammons because he said the university ""did not act"" following the death of Robert Champion, who died last month after a halftime performance in a football game in Orlando, Florida. But Montgomery dropped the proposal, and the board delivered a reprimand instead. As he argued to put Ammons on leave, Montgomery noted how the board of governors of the State University System of Florida took action before the university's trustees could. ""It's been 19 days since the death of a student occurred, a death of a student that was in our structure of authority. I'm being advised don't say anything that could put us in a bad position here or there. What is right is right,"" Montgomery told the board Thursday. ""This student was under our care, under our authority. We did not act, we did not meet, we generally punted on this issue,"" Montgomery added. ""I'm of the opinion the (State University System of Florida) Board of Governors stepped in to fill the vacuum, when they did not have to. I believe that had we shown action -- prudent actions -- there would not have been a cause for them to have an investigation because we would have been conducting ourselves in a sound manner. The board of governors stepped in in an attempt to do our job,"" he said. No cause of death has been released in Champion's case, but police and university officials both have said they suspect it was related to hazing. Prior to Montgomery's remarks, Ammons said his administration took ""these occurrences very seriously."" ""We have taken all the actions that are part of policies, practices and procedures in dealing with allegations of hazing. Once allegations of hazing are (determined to be) true, they are immediately referred to our police department if it occurs on campus or to the Tallahassee Police Department if it occurs off campus,"" Ammons said. Ammons said his administrators have ""cooperated fully"" with Orange County Sheriff's investigators and added that the school has provided grief counselors to the student body and heightened anti-hazing awareness. White, who has served as director of bands since 1998, was placed on administrative leave with pay until the investigation is complete. The university rescinded its earlier decision to suspend him, with termination scheduled for December 22. The school also reversed an earlier decision to dismiss four students ""who received disciplinary action regarding a hazing incident with Mr. Champion,"" Ammons said. CNN's John Couwels reported from Orlando, Florida, and Michael Martinez from Los Angeles.","FAMU trustees opt to reprimand president instead of putting him on administrative leave .

"(CNN) -- Liverpool are waiting to learn the extent of the injury which prevented captain Steven Gerrard playing in the club's 2-0 win at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday, manager Kenny Dalglish has said. England international Gerrard, 31, missed the match after picking up an infection in his right ankle, having only recently recovered from a groin injury which has restricted the midfielder to just four English Premier League appearances this season. Dalglish also faced questions on the fitness of former England defender Jamie Carragher, who was ruled out of the match at the Hawthorns with a calf strain. ""Carragher has a calf strain. Steven Gerrard has an infection in his ankle,"" Dalglish, 60, told a press conference. ""Steven was in my mind for the game today but it just flared up. ""We are off tomorrow, so we'll have a more accurate idea on Monday or Tuesday when we return to training. We will be more accurate next week than what we can be now."" Dalglish, who also managed the Anfield club between 1985 and 1991, praised the injured duo, while also expressing his delight at seeing his charges pick up three points without two of the team's most influential players. ""We are certainly much better with them in the squad than out of it,"" he said. ""They have done magnificently for this football club and they will continue to do magnificently for us too. ""They will continue to make a contribution, even now. I suppose it is a reflection on the strength of the squad when the two talisman figures are not playing and you still come and put on such a top performance."" Gerrard and Carragher are products of the Liverpool youth academy, with both players part of the team which earned a penalty shoot-out victory over Italian side AC Milan in the 2005 European Champions League final. Dalglish will hope to have the duo available for the home match against Swansea City on Saturday.","Liverpool are waiting to learn how long injured captain Steven Gerrard will be out for .

"(CNN) -- Search and rescue teams on Friday were trying to reach an airplane that crashed with 18 people aboard in the mountains of western Indonesia, an air transportation official said. Air traffic controllers lost contact with the airplane Thursday morning shortly after it took off from the Medan Polonia Airport in North Sumatra. It was bound for the Kutacane district in Aceh province when it crashed in the mountains in North Sumatra, said Henry Bakti, Indonesia's director general for air transportation. The plane was spotted during an aerial search, and it appeared to be largely intact, Bakti told reporters. The condition of the passengers, including two children and two infants, was not immediately known, he said. Nusantara Buana Air owns the plane, which operates nine planes and services destinations in Aceh from the Medan Polonia and Banda Aceh airports. Airplanes are the primary mode of transportation between Indonesia's scattered islands. In May, a plane that crashed off the coast of Kaimana killed at least 15 people. Indonesia's poor aviation record has led the European Union and the United States to blacklist a number of the country's small airlines, including Nusantara Buana Air. CNN's Kathy Quiano contributed to this report.","The airplane carrying 14 people crashed in the mountains in North Sumatra, an air official says .

"San Juan, Puerto Rico (CNN) -- The father of a 7-year-old girl abducted and killed near her north Georgia home this month said Sunday he is ""relieved"" to have his daughter back in Puerto Rico, where she will be buried this week. A funeral for Jorelys Rivera will be held Monday in Penuelas, her father, Ricardo Galarza, said. The burial will take place Tuesday, he said. Services were held Saturday for mourners in Georgia before her body was flown to Puerto Rico. Galarza told CNN last week that he last saw his daughter two years ago, when she visited for the summer. She was supposed to visit for Christmas this year, Galarza said. Jorelys disappeared December 2 near a playground at a Canton, Georgia, apartment complex. Searchers found her body in a trash bin three days later. Authorities have accused 20-year-old Ryan Brunn -- a maintenance worker at the complex -- of killing her. Jorelys died of blunt force trauma to the head and was stabbed and sexually assaulted, according to authorities. A date for Brunn's arraignment has not been set. David Cannon Sr., one of Brunn's court-appointed attorneys, has said that his client will plead not guilty.","Jorelys Rivera's father says he is ""relieved"" to have her back in Puerto Rico .

"(CNN) -- Samuel Eto'o has rejected claims his move to Anzhi Makhachkala is all about money and claims he wants to transform the Russian club into a ""big"" team. The former Barcelona striker signed with Anzhi, who hail from the war-torn Dagestan region of Russia, on Wednesday from Italian outfit Inter Milan. The four-time African Footballer of the Year will be paid around $14 million a season for the length of his three-year deal with Anzhi said to have paid a reported fee of $30 million to seal the capture. Eto'o jetted into Russia on Wednesday and joined up with his new team-mates in Moscow on Thursday as they prepare for the weekend match with Rostov. Anzhi train in Moscow and fly to home games from the Russian capital -- a journey of some 1,250 miles. At a press conference Eto'o, who has won the European Champions League three times, told reporters he was excited by his new challenge. ""I'm impatient to play the first home game, but most important to take this project from the base and make it big,"" he said. ""I never say how many goals I'm going to score, my intention is to be happy and make sure that people around me are too. I think that when we are happy we can bring better results. ""I'm happy that they have trusted me, with this project, I believe I can return to him (the Anzhi president) inside the field and outside as well, helping the club with good results."" In local paper Sovietsky Sport daily the Cameroon striker insisted his move was not purely about finance. ""The project is very interesting, money is not so important for me, that's just part of football,"" Eto'o was quoted as saying. ""It was always important for me to be happy -- and now I am happy. I came to Anzhi because it is a new project and they are starting from scratch. I am interested. I have won everything I possibly could have in Europe."" In a statement on Inter's official web site Eto'o thanked the club and its president, Massimo Moratti, for a ""fantastic"" two years in Italy. ""I will never forget the affection of the Inter fans who made me feel like one of them and who always supported and helped me."" Meanwhile, English club Tottenham Hotspur confirmed Thursday they have signed Manchester City striker Emmanuel Adebayor on a season-long loan.

"(CNN) -- Texas police on Friday released a composite sketch of a man they believe broke into the homes of four former members of the same sorority, then sexually assaulted them. No name has been given for the suspect in the alleged break-ins and attacks, which took place between November 2010 and October 2011, according to a timeline from the Plano police. Detectives, however, do have ""a definite DNA profile on the suspect"" after a crime lab report, the police statement noted. Plano police in October released a video -- dated in April -- showing a man with a distinctive swagger who they believe is responsible. Snapshots from that video were distributed Friday. The alleged assaults occurred in the cities of Plano, Coppell and Corinth, all suburbs of Dallas. The alleged victims -- all females in their mid-50s to mid-60s -- were alumnae of the same predominantly African-American sorority: Delta Sigma Theta, according to police. They offered similar descriptions of their assailant as being a black male in his late 30s to mid-40s, weighing from 275 to 300 pounds and standing between 5 feet 7 inches and 5 feet 9 inches tall. ""He made it obvious to our victims that he knew information ... about them personally,"" Plano police spokesman Andre Smith said this fall, adding that none of the women believes they knew their attacker in advance. According to Corinth Police Capt. Greg Wilkerson, all the assaults occurred in ""residential settings"" between 9:15 p.m. and 4 a.m. when the victims were alone. The alleged attack in his city, 35 miles northwest of Dallas, took place on October 14. The late-night setting, the fact the victims were often asleep and the alleged assailant's ""attempts to conceal his identity"" make it challenging to definitively identify the attacker, said Wilkerson. Wilkerson said that the nature of the assaults suggest the alleged assailant was ""possibly suspecting surveillance, spending some time around the areas ... prior to the attacks."" The police captain said authorities do not know how the suspect learned details of the victims, speculating it may have been over the Internet, by accessing an old directory or noticing would-be victims with Delta Sigma Theta jewelry, placards or other paraphernalia out in public. Delta Sigma Theta President Cynthia M.A. Butler-McIntyre this fall issued a statement urging members in the Dallas area to take precautions. ""To think that our members are being targeted is disturbing and extremely disheartening,"" she said.","Plano, Texas, police distribute composite sketch of the sexual assault suspect .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Secretary of Defense says any agreement reached that keeps American troops in Iraq past an end-of-the-year deadline to withdraw must include immunity from Iraqi prosecution. ""If they want the benefits of what we can provide, if they want the assistance, if they want the training, if they want the operational skills that we can provide, then I think they have to understand that they've got to give us some protections in that process,"" Leon Panetta told sailors Friday during a visit to Naples, Italy, home of the U.S. 6th Fleet. Panetta's statement follows news this week that Iraq's top political leadership agreed that a number of American troops should remain in the country to aid in training and security, though said it was ""unnecessary"" to grant U.S. forces legal immunity. Panetta made the comments while answering a question from a sailor, who inquired about Iraq refusing to grant legal immunity to American forces and what it might mean for the future role of the U.S. military in Iraq. ""This is obviously a very pertinent question right now as we try to deal with the issue of whether or not we'll have a future presence in Iraq,"" Panetta said, according to a transcript released by the Department of Defense. The defense secretary said negotiations were ongoing between Iraq's political leadership, U.S. Ambassador James F. Jeffrey and Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, commander of U.S. forces in Iraq. Panetta said the meetings include discussions about what are the rights of American troops and what will be required in order for those troops to assist Iraqi forces in the future. ""If you're going to play a large role in dealing with another country where it requires, as I said, a large group of troops to be on the ground and to be dealing with that country, I want to make damn sure that you're protected,"" Panetta told the sailors. The U.S. has grown increasingly frustrated with the pace of the negotiations, which have dragged well past an Iraqi self-imposed August deadline to decide whether to keep troops. The negotiations have been strained following WikiLeaks' release of a diplomatic cable that alleged Iraqi civilians, including children, were killed in a 2006 raid by American troops rather than in an airstrike as initially reported by the U.S. military. The Pentagon dismissed the cable from U.N. investigator Philip Alston to U.S. officials, saying it had investigated the claims and found there was no merit. Shortly after the WikiLeaks cable gained attention in news reports in September by McClatchy Newspapers, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki ordered an investigation into the deaths outside of Tikrit. U.S. officials have long said they believe Iraq may need help with training, counterterrorism, air defense, command and control and intelligence operations. Any U.S. troops remaining to do those jobs might also need additional security forces. The prospect of U.S. troops staying beyond the end of the year sits uncomfortably with many Iraqis, who have routinely questioned American motives following the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Radical anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, whose Sadrist political party is closely aligned with al-Maliki, has vowed to escalate armed resistance if the U.S. military does not leave as scheduled, a move that could destabilize the country should his militia repeat the bloody battles it waged against American and Iraqi forces during the height of violence. Gen. Raymond Odierno, the new Army Chief of Staff, said last month there would be risks in leaving a large force of U.S. troops in Iraq. A large U.S. force, he said, could provoke new claims of U.S. occupation and distract from efforts to develop the Iraqi military's abilities. He would not comment directly on reports that the White House administration had decided to leave between 3,000 and 5,000 troops, should they be requested by Iraq. Odierno, who served as the top U.S. commander in Iraq, said training of Iraqi security forces was not complete. ""We need to probably be there to assist them at certain levels for a while,"" he said last month in a question-and-answer session with journalists at the Pentagon.

"Washington (CNN) -- House Republican leaders will unveil a 21-page ""Pledge to America"" on Thursday that presents a ""governing agenda"" for what Republicans would do if they win control of Congress in November. CNN obtained a copy of the document (PDF) Wednesday. The plan focuses primarily on jobs and the economy, with a short reference in the ""preamble"" to the party's position on social issues. According to the document, House Republicans want to permanently extend all the tax cuts due to expire at the end of this year, give small businesses a tax deduction equal to 20 percent of their income and require Congress to review any new federal regulations that add to the deficit. The document lacks, however, a pledge against unrelated pet projects that members of Congress insert in spending bills to bring funding to their home districts -- known as earmarks. Banning earmarks is typically a staple of Republican policy. Some provisions matched positions of the conservative Tea Party movement that has helped defeat mainstream Republican candidates in several primary elections this year. For example, the document calls for a federal hiring freeze on nonsecurity employees and requiring all legislation to include a clause showing that it is authorized under the Constitution. Other items would cancel unspent funding authorized by the economic stimulus bill, roll back spending to levels before the stimulus bill and earlier federal bailout legislation and repeal the health care reform bill passed in March. The document also calls for permanently prohibiting taxpayer funding for abortion. Several Republican sources said there was no intention to directly address social issues because the electorate is so heavily focused on jobs and spending. Republican leaders settled on a line that states: ""We pledge to honor families, traditional marriage, life, and the private and faith-based organizations that form the core of our American values."" This language was a late addition, according to a GOP source, after conservative Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana argued that social issues should be included in the document representing the agenda of House Republicans. House Democratic leaders said the document showed that Republicans want to return to what they called failed policies of the past. A statement from House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer's office mocked the GOP positions, saying they showed that Republicans pledged allegiance to hedge fund managers on Wall Street, insurance companies, the ""wealthiest of the wealthy,"" oil companies and big corporations that outsource jobs, ""with a recession and huge deficits for all."" The GOP document represents an updated version of the 1994 ""Contract with America."" That much shorter, 10-item document, with specific bills attached to each item that would be passed with a Republican victory, was rolled out on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and signed by GOP members of Congress and candidates. The 2010 version has more than 20 items, including changes to how Congress works and broad policy goals such as tougher sanctions against Iran. While it does contain legislative proposals, it does not include specific bills that would be introduced and passed if Republicans gain control of the House. Introduced at roughly the same time as the previous contract, several weeks before midterm congressional elections, the ""Pledge to America"" will be unveiled at a hardware store in Sterling, Virginia, outside Washington. A GOP lawmaker involved in putting together the document said House Republicans realize that voters are angry with both Democrats and Republicans. The agenda contained in the ""Pledge to America"" is intended to convince such voters that their concerns are taken seriously by Republicans, who will act differently if returned to power than they did when controlling Congress during parts of the Bush administration, the legislator said. CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this story.","NEW: Unlike 1994 ""Contract with America,"" ""Pledge"" has no specific legislation .
NEW: No pledge to ban earmarks .
Ban on federal funding for abortion, support for ""traditional marriage"" included .

"(CNN) -- England striker Wayne Rooney has escaped further punishment after a show of petulance following his sending off during Manchester United's weekend defeat at Fulham. Wayne Rooney confronts referee Phil Dowd following his dismissal during the defeat at Fulham. But Rooney will receive a formal written warning from the Football Association after punching the corner flag when ordered from the pitch. Rooney was dismissed for two bookable offences during his side's 2-0 defeat -- the second caution coming after he hurled the ball in the direction of where referee Phil Dowd wanted a free kick taken. Although Rooney exchanged words with Dowd after being shown red, the official has confirmed he was not sworn at by the player. An FA spokesman said: ""We have clarified with Phil Dowd that there was no abuse from the player after he was dismissed. ""In relation to the incident when he punched the corner flag, the referee did not see that and we have written to Wayne Rooney reminding him of his responsibilities."" It means Rooney will only be suspended for one game, the Premier League visit of Aston Villa to Old Trafford on April 5.","Wayne Rooney escapes further punishment following dismissal at Fulham .

"(CNN) -- Airline passengers are already able to check in to flights, download boarding passes, select a seat on the go and keep an eye on the upgrades list thanks to recent evolutions in smartphone technology, and the options just keep growing. A global industrywide Airline IT Trends Survey shows that more than 90% of the airlines surveyed are increasing their investment in mobile capabilities to ease the hassles of getting through the airport and improve the in-flight experience. And the airlines are likely to find a way to generate revenue, too. So what's a flier to expect from airline apps on the horizon? In the not-too-distant future, you'll probably be able to rent a car, pay bag fees and use augmented reality to find the nearest airport bar through your airline's smartphone app. Delta Air Lines is putting emphasis on improving mobile functionality. While some airline apps allow travelers to make flight reservations (a feature that Delta has not introduced but promises is coming), the world's largest carrier is one of the few airlines that gives customers the ability to adjust travel itineraries from their mobile device. Delayed Delta passengers who miss a connection now can immediately rebook a different flight and download a new boarding pass, all while in the air. The airline has some new app plans up its sleeve as well. Delta declines to give a release date for the feature, but it is close to unveiling a new tool where travelers can track checked baggage from their mobile devices, according to Delta spokesman Paul Skrbec. (They can already do so on the airline's website.) The airline eventually could offer other services on its mobile app that are already listed on its website, such as the ability to search for hotel and car rental reservations, Skrbec said. GuestLogix, a company that creates onboard merchandising technology, is already trying to integrate these services into an airline app with the launch of its OnTouch Mobile Concierge platform, which it pitched to major airlines this week, a company official said. The mobile app does not just offer access to itinerary details, but it also functions as a one-stop shop for airline passengers to make in-air purchases related to their trip, such as in-flight refreshments and arrangements for ground transportation, dining and entertainment in the destination city. GuestLogix says it is in talks with most major North American carriers about implementing the OnTouch Mobile Concierge, which would likely be offered by airlines as a separate app from the ticketing-based ones that exist. ""We are providing airlines with the opportunity to offer their passengers a streamlined experience,"" said Brett Proud, GuestLogix's executive vice president of new markets and products. ""Disparity within the mobile channel is a huge issue despite the fact that consumers are increasingly expecting cross-platform integration and a consistent experience. The fully integrated mobile platform that we have built allows travelers to check in to flights and hotels, view travel information and updates, and receive offers from multiple airline carriers, hotels and other services -- all at one time, and in one place."" The hope is the OnTouch Mobile Concierge will also allow airlines to generate new revenue streams by capitalizing for the first time on destination-related purchases. But integrating outside products and services into airline apps is not the only way that airlines hope to customize the passenger experience while increasing revenue. According to Delta's Skrbec, the demand is likely there for airlines eventually to offer add-ons such as standby upgrades and the ability to pay for extra checked baggage through mobile applications, but industry research suggests that offering those types of mobile transactions won't happen overnight. According to a report released this year by Amadeus, a company that develops technology for the travel industry, ancillary services -- from premium seating to in-flight meals -- are unlikely to be sold on airlines' mobile platforms on a widespread level for another year or two. So more add-ons and products will be available, but is help on the way for slogging through the airport? American, United and Continental airlines currently offer airport maps in their mobile apps, with Delta soon to join them. But the maps are generally useful only in locating gates; they don't offer detailed information on where to find food and shopping locations. Augmented reality technology may come to the rescue here. It allows users to point the camera on their smartphone at their surroundings and receive corresponding information about their current location, such as which restaurants and stores are nearby. Amadeus's report estimates it will take three to five years for most airlines to find a way to integrate augmented reality into an airline app. Airlines might take some cues from a new app released by Denmark's Copenhagen Airport this year, which became the world's first application to use augmented reality indoors successfully -- according to SITA, the app's developer. The app allows travelers at the airport to access not just gate information but also details on surrounding shops and services, saving them time while trying to catch a flight. Even when it comes to selling fares through mobile clients, a service that 85% of airlines in the Airline IT Trends Survey either offer or plan to offer by 2014, there is room for improvement. Currently, airline apps only offer tickets with their specific carrier, and mobile customers can't take advantage of the flexibility offered by airline alliances. ""Airline alliances, the Star Alliance in particular, haven't really kept pace with mobile developments,"" said Dennis Schaal, the North America editor of the travel tech site Tnooz.com. ""Granted, creating a mobile app that brings in dozens of airlines would be no easy task, but there should be some kind of booking capability at this juncture."" The Star Alliance has two mobile apps available for download: one that offers airport information in addition to the ability to search and track flights, and another that is a fare finder for flights on the alliance's airlines. The Star Alliance includes airlines such as United, Continental, Air Canada and US Airways -- which does not currently offer a mobile app. But those airlines that fail to take the full leap into the mobile world will quickly find themselves in the minority. Apps might not replace websites as the primary place where people purchase airline reservations, especially with new airline initiatives to integrate ticket-purchasing apps into social-media sites such as Facebook. However, they're beginning to offer a level of customer service and convenience that has never before been possible in the industry, and perhaps could even transform the experience of traveling enough to create a new barometer on which airline brands will be judged in the future.","Airlines are increasing their investment in mobile capabilities .

"(CNN) -- Greece's economic turmoil threatens to topple the eurozone, shake the global financial markets and bring down the protagonist in the political drama: embattled Prime Minister George Papandreou. Papandreou has been at the center of the financial storm in Europe, with his political future on the line after a turbulent day of political wrangling between the government and opposition. As the 59-year-old comes under fire for his call for a referendum on the latest bailout package from Europe, the world is anxiously watching. And uncertainty looms for a man surrounded by power from an early age. Born in Minnesota and educated in the United States, Sweden and several other countries, Papandreou has seen the world as a student and a diplomat. The son and grandson of former leaders, Papandreou is a product of Greece's political establishment. His grandfather served as prime minister in the 1960s, a position assumed about two decades later by his father after he founded the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK party. During his first run for Greece's top job in 2004, Papandreou did not shy away from touting his family legacy. ""I am very, very honored to have such a name,"" he said at the time. ""It is a heavy responsibility, but it is the Greek people in the end who make the decision."" While his name is a political institution in the South European nation, his rise to power was hardly preordained -- considering he was born more than 5,000 miles from Athens, on June 16, 1952, in St. Paul, Minnesota. His father, Andreas, joined the University of Minnesota faculty five years earlier as an associate economics professor, rising later to full professor before leaving in 1955 for a post at the University of Berkeley in California. ""He was a most charismatic character: His eyes seemed to burn with zeal,"" Scott Maynes said of the elder Papandreou in a University of Minnesota economics department newsletter. ""It bothered me that he seemed to see the CIA under every bed ... But what impressed me most of all about Papandreou was the strong commitment he inspired."" The prime minister's mother, Margaret Chant, graduated with a journalism degree in 1946, from the Twin Cities university. Six years later, the same year her son was born, she earned her master's degree in public health. In a letter in the 1972 edition of the University of Minnesota alumni news magazine, Margaret Chant Papandreou explained how her family left the United States in 1959 and settled into ""political life"" in Greece. She wrote then that she initially spoke little Greek, though her children -- young George included -- ""attended Greek schools."" Her friends, she said, tended to be educated in England or the United States. And she particularly bristled at what she deemed Greece's ""machismo"" culture, and the tendency of men in authority to demean and unfairly punish women who spoke out. ""They detested me,"" Chant Papandreou recalled of those aligned against her and her husband. ""I had 'mingled too much in politics,' they declared... If I weren't in the fight for the liberation of Greece, I'd surely be in the fight for the liberation of Greek women."" The Papandreou family's lives turned upside down following a military coup in April 1967, leading to a globe-trotting existence evident in the schools the prime minister attended including in Illinois, Stockholm and Toronto. Papandreou also attended Amherst College, a small and prestigious liberal arts institution in central Massachusetts where he roomed with Antonis Samaras, according to Amherst's news office. Samaras would later become his primary political rival as the leader of Greece's conservative New Democracy party. He has described the prime minister as untrustworthy and demanded he resign and call for snap elections in six weeks. After attending schools in far-flung cities, he eventually returned to Greece and immersed himself in politics. He first won election to parliament in 1981 and within a few years, he was a key figure in his father's PASOK's party. While still a parliamentary member, he assumed several ministerial positions where he coordinated the government's unsuccessful bid to win the 1996 Olympic summer games. After a short stint away from top ministry positions and fresh off heading Greece's winning 2004 Olympic bid, he emerged as a prominent international figure in the late 1990s. He became a tested diplomat on various issues, including fostering positive relations with Turkey, boosting support for the U.S.-led coalition against terrorism and serving as a key figure in helping defuse a 2002 crisis involving militants expelled from the West Bank after taking refuge in Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity. One of his biggest milestones came last month when he negotiated another round of bailout funding (and mandated austerity measures), worth about 130 billion euros ($178 billion). It remains to be seen whether that agreement will be realized, or whether Papandreou will be in power if, and when, Greece turns the financial corner.

"(CNN) -- Claudio Marchisio's late double gave Juventus a 2-0 win over reigning champions AC Milan Sunday to go back to the top of the Serie A standings. The game in Turin looked set to end in a draw until Marchisio scored three minutes from time then added a late second to seal three points which put Juve ahead of Udinese on goal scored. Defeat continued Milan's poor start to the campaign and they lanquish in 15th, two places and a point ahead of arch-rivals Inter. Juventus created a number of openings to break the deadlock but with the clock counting down made the breakthrough. Marchisio went for a one-two with Mirko Vucinic but in trying to intercept Milan's Daniele Bonera only succeeded in slamming the ball onto Marchisio's foot and into the net. In injury time, Marchisio beat Christian Abbiati with a long range strike which the goalkeeper should have saved. Earlier, Udinese kept pace with a 2-0 win over Bologna as Mehdi Benatia gave them the lead on 29 minutes. Captain Antonio Di Natale scored the second from the penalty spot after Pablo Armero had been fouled. Napoli are a point behind in third following a fine 3-0 win at 10-man Inter Saturday. Meanwhile in the German Bundesliga Sunday, coach Huub Stevens made a winning start for Schalke as they won 2-1 at Hamburg. Klaas Jan Huntelaar opened the scoring after 13 minutes only for Mladen Petric to level seven minutes before the break. Dutch ace Huntelaar grabbed the winner with 17 minutes left. In the other match played, Werder Bremen failed in their bid to join Bayern Munich at the top of the table as they were beaten 3-2 by Hanover. Mohammed Abdellaoue scored a hat-trick for Hanover, who held on despite a late Claudio Pizarro goal for Bremen.","Juventus top of Serie A after 2-0 win over champions AC Milan .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge on Monday blocked implementation of a law that would have mandated tobacco companies include on cigarette packages graphic pictures and messages showing the dangers of smoking. ""This case poses a constitutional challenge to a bold new tact (sic) by the Congress, and the FDA, in their obvious and continuing efforts to minimize, if not eradicate, tobacco use in the United States,"" concluded U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon, who cited First Amendment rights against unconstitutionally compelled speech as a factor in his 29-page decision. ""Notwithstanding the potential legal and financial ramifications of this challenge, the Government, for reasons known only to itself, is unwilling to voluntarily stay the effective date of this Rule until the Judicial Branch can appropriately review the constitutionality of the Government's novel -- and costly -- approach to regulating tobacco packaging and advertising. Thus, this Court must -- and will -- act to preserve the status quo until it can evaluate, on the merits (and without incurring irreparable harm to those companies genuinely affected), the constitutionality of the commercial speech that these graphic images compel,"" Leon wrote in his decision. Gallery: See the cigarette labels . He said the tobacco companies had shown: a substantial likelihood of success; that allowing the labeling requirements to proceed would cause them to ""suffer irreparable harm""; that ""neither the Government, nor the public, will suffer any comparable injury as a result of the relief sought""; and that the public's ""interest in the protection of its First Amendment rights against unconstitutionally compelled speech would be furthered."" The 36 proposed images include a man exhaling smoke through a hole in his throat; diseased lungs next to healthy lungs; a mouth bearing what appear to be cancerous lesions; a bare-chested male cadaver with chest staples down his torso. Opinion: Can scary labels, taxes end smoking? Leon noted that the some of the pictures appeared to have been digitally enhanced or manipulated to make them ""evoke emotion"" and are not therefore ""purely factual,"" as the government had asserted. Though Congress mandated the images fill the top half of the front and back of cigarette packages, Leon said the dimensions suggest it was trying to turn cigarettes into mini-billboards intended not to impart information about smoking but ""to advocate a change in consumer behavior."" In a statement, Matthew L. Myers, the president of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called the decision ""wrong on the science and wrong on the law"" and called for the Justice Department to appeal. ""If allowed to stand, this ruling would make it impossible to implement any effective warning labels,"" he said, adding that Leon's ruling ""ignores the overwhelming scientific evidence about the need for the new cigarette warnings and their effectiveness"" and ignores First Amendment precedent that supports the right of the government to require warning labels to protect public health. Myers noted that studies have shown that such graphic warnings are effective at ""informing consumers about the health risks of smoking, discouraging children and other nonsmokers from starting to smoke, and motivating smokers to quit."" FDA reveals bigger, graphic warning labels for cigarette packages . At least 43 other countries require such cigarette box warnings, he said. The law on the labels was to have kicked in beginning next September. ""They serve the compelling goal of reducing the death and disease caused by tobacco use, which kills more than 400,000 Americans and costs the nation $96 billion in health care expenditures each year,"" Myers said. Richard Daynard, a professor at Northeastern University Law School and head of the Tobacco Products Liability Project, said the case may not be resolved for years, and the matter is an urgent one. ""Even a relatively modest percentage improvement or a percentage reduction in initiation or continued use will potentially save tens of thousands of lives per year,"" he said.","Judge cites First Amendment rights against unconstitutionally compelled speech .

"(CNN) -- Greece is in a state of political turmoil sparked by Prime Minister George Papandreou's call earlier this week for a referendum on the latest bailout package from Europe. A confidence vote in his government is scheduled for Friday night -- in the meantime, uncertainty rules. The crisis is unfolding as leaders of the G-20 group of nations meet in Cannes, France, for economic talks, amid fears that a debt default in Greece could send shock waves through the global economy. So what could come next for Greece? Analysts see several potential scenarios. The vote of confidence in Papandreou's government is expected to go ahead as planned, despite discussions Thursday on the formation of an interim coalition or national unity government. If he wins the confidence vote, he could claim a fresh mandate for his ruling Socialist PASOK party -- although even some within his party think its days in charge are numbered. Senior PASOK lawmaker Tilemachos Chytiris told Greek state TV channel ERT that ideally Papandreou would win the vote, but a national unity government would then be formed. If he loses the vote, the government would go into caretaker status until early elections can be held, said Heather Conley, senior fellow and director of the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state. ""What's a foregone conclusion is that Papandreou would have to step down and allow a technocratic government that would receive the full support of parliament to be that caretaker,"" she said. In another scenario, the leader of the main opposition New Democracy party said Thursday that his party could enter a coalition government with the PASOK party, as an interim stage leading to new elections. Papandreou's office said he is prepared to enter a national unity government with the opposition, but rejected the condition that early elections be held. Opposition leader Antonis Samaras later Thursday said Papandreou should step down and called for snap elections within six weeks. Under Greek law, a vote cannot be held until at least 30 days after elections are called, meaning that the Greek people would go to the polls in early December at the soonest. In that case, it would be likely that the conservatives would win the most votes but would not have a parliamentary majority, forcing them to form a coalition government, said Kostas Gemenis, an assistant professor of politics at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. That coalition could include far-right parties or PASOK, but with the New Democracy lawmakers in the driver's seat. The conservatives have said Greece needs to bargain harder with Europe on any deal. Another scenario is that PASOK and the conservatives join in a longer-term grand coalition, or unity, government. That option would give greater stability, as it would avoid elections, and could ensure that Greece stayed in the euro and the European Union, said Gemenis. As for the planned referendum, the likelihood of it taking place appears to be diminishing. Papandreou told his Cabinet Thursday he was backing off from a referendum vote because the opposition New Democracy party had agreed to the need to pass austerity measures required by the bailout. And the office of Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said Friday he had confirmed to the European Commission that the referendum had been scrapped. That news would certainly come as a relief to Europe's leaders. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy warned Papandreou in Cannes Wednesday that Greece would have to leave the euro zone if voters rejected the bailout plan. But Greece could find it hard to put the cat back in the bag now it's been allowed out, Conley said. Although some observers say the referendum will not survive if Papandreou does not, she foresees a scenario where the Greek people demand a say in decisions that will affect them, and their country, for decades. She warns it could also lead to the governments of other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Italy, facing calls for difficult decisions to be put them to a referendum. The recent crisis has prompted talk of a ""democracy deficit,"" she said, as people in the different countries within the European Union complain that they have no say in important issues. Defiance of Europe's wishes would come at a substantial cost for Greece. At stake is a deal that would wipe out 100 billion euros in Greek debt, half of what it owes to private creditors, and a promise of 30 billion euros from the public sector to help pay off some of the remaining debts. That makes the whole deal worth 130 billion euros ($178 billion). If its people vote ""no"" to the bailout plan, European leaders have made clear they will not hand over a sixth tranche of European funds from a previously agreed bailout. The Greek government is expected to run out of money in mid-November, and that 8 billion euro (about $10.9 billion) tranche is needed to keep it afloat. There are already signs that Greece's domestic banking system is starting to seize up amid the doubts over future European funding, Conley said. As for the euro zone -- the group of 17 European nations that use the euro as currency -- the top priority will be to stop the turmoil in Greece spreading beyond its borders. Ahead of the G-20 summit, U.S. President Barack Obama made clear that the stakes were high for everyone and that ""contagion"" must be prevented. ""The most important task for us is to resolve the financial crisis here in Europe,"" he said, adding that the United States will ""continue to be a partner with Europe to resolve these issues."" Paola Subacchi, research director in international economics at the London-based Chatham House think tank, said it was imperative that a robust firewall be put in place around Greece to stop other countries being dragged down. Such a firewall would include a better-funded European bailout find and flexible credit for countries caught up on the margins of the crisis, she said. She predicts that whatever the fate of Papandreou's government, Greece is likely to be in a state of political paralysis for some time. Europe must put provisions in place to allow Greece to leave the euro, if that becomes necessary, with minimum damage, she said. ""The priority now is to focus not on Greece but on the rest of Europe, in particular Italy, which is the country most likely to be affected,"" she said. A joint statement from European Council president Herman Van Rompuy and European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso at the G-20 reiterated Europe's commitment to keeping the euro zone above water. ""Europe is fully aware of its responsibility in these difficult times. We, as the world's largest market, have to play a major role in the global recovery,"" they said.

"(CNN) -- October 6, 1981, remains etched in the minds of Egyptians who witnessed the assassination of President Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat at the hands of four military officers during an annual parade celebrating the anniversary of Egypt's 1973 war with Israel. In 1979, Sadat signed the Camp David peace treaty with Israel that won him the Nobel Peace Prize and the fury of many Arabs who accused him of betraying their cause. In a tribute to the former ""hero of war and peace,"" as the inscription on his grave reads, Egyptian State TV ran footage Thursday of the assassination, depicting the moment Sadat stood in the pavilion saluting his killers while they fired at him as French Mirage fighters screeched over the parade grounds as part of the festivities. Khaled El Islambouly, the lead gunman, was captured and executed. Sadat's bullet-riddled body was rushed to the Maadi Military Hospital and the president was proclaimed dead at 2.40 p.m. due to ""intense nervous shock and internal bleeding in the chest cavity."" Talaat El Sadat, a former member of parliament and the nephew of the slain president, recalls the details of that grim day. ""The president thought the killers were part of the show when they approached the stands firing, so he stood saluting them,"" El Sadat told CNN. El Sadat claims his uncle refused to wear bulletproof vests and always confidently argued, ""I am among my sons."" An investigation uncovered evidence that the killers had plotted the attack with Al Gamaa al-Islamiyya, a Muslim Brotherhood offshoot that had failed ambitions of launching an Islamic revolution in the mid-1980s. Aboud El Zomor, the leader of Al Gamaa al-Islamiyya, was convicted of plotting the assassination and spent almost 30 years behind bars before his release in April, among hundreds of political prisoners detained during President Hosni Mubarak's regime. Three decades later, in his first interview with a U.S. television news organization since his release, El Zomor was unapologetic about being a part of the killing of Sadat. ""Our role was related to assisting but not decision-making,"" El Zomor recalled in his interview with CNN. ""All that we did, our role, is that we had ammunition that we sent"" to the assassins. ""The idea was just to change and provide an alternative leader who could save Egypt from a crisis of the political dead-end we lived in then,"" El Zomor explained. ""I intended complete change, not just the murder of Sadat."" He cheered the January 25 revolution that ousted Mubarak on February 11 and felt ""jealous"" that his own religious revolution did not succeed. He also claimed that Al Gamaa al-Islamiyya has renounced its military arm because there was ""no need to fight the oppression of the former Mubarak regime."" The fall of regimes almost always comes with the unveiling of secret documents and conspiracy theories. Sadat's assassination was recently revisited by his daughter, Roqaya al-Sadat, a month after Mubarak was toppled. She filed a case in March at the general prosecutor's office claiming new evidence had emerged implicating Mubarak, who was Sadat's vice president. ""The lead gunman's machine gun jammed and he reached in the vehicle for another gun,"" said Talaat El Sadat. He demands an explanation to how guns without their safety pins were smuggled in. ""Where was my uncle's elite security all this time?"" ""The answer (to all of this) is Hosni Mubarak. He benefits the most from the killing, assisted by the Americans and the Israelis,"" El Sadat said. Meanwhile, the peace with Israel that Sadat worked relentlessly to achieve may be at the brink of collapse. Anti-Israeli sentiment in Egypt in the past few months has been its most violent since the times of Sadat, as highlighted by the pro-democracy protesters who breached the Israeli Embassy on September 9. The same protesters who brought down the Mubarak regime insist on ending the exports of gas to Israel and many call for the cancellation of the Camp David Peace Treaty after an incident on the Israeli-Egyptian border left five Egyptian soldiers dead.","Egyptian president was assassinated in October 1981 .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Boxing great Joe Frazier, who went toe to toe three times with Muhammad Ali, including the famous ""Thrilla in Manila"" fight, is seriously ill with liver cancer and is in a hospice, his personal and business manager said Saturday. Frazier, 67, is in a Philadelphia facility, manager Leslie Wolff said. The former heavyweight champion was diagnosed just four or five weeks ago. ""He's a true gentleman,"" Wolff said. ""Along with Muhammad Ali, (he is) one of the two most recognizable athletes in the world."" Frazier, nicknamed ""Smokin' Joe,"" used his devastating left hook with impunity during his professional career, retiring with a 32-4-1 record. Frazier, the son of a South Carolina sharecropper, boxed during the glory days of the heavyweight division, going up against greats George Foreman, Oscar Bonavena, Joe Bugner and Jimmy Ellis. But it was his three much-hyped fights against Ali that helped seal his legend. Frazier bested Ali at 1971's ""Fight of the Century"" at Madison Square Garden. In the 15th round, Frazier landed perhaps the most famous left hook in history, catching Ali on the jaw and dropping the former champ for a four-count, according to Frazier's bio at the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Frazier left the ring still the champ after handing Ali his first professional defeat. SI: Top 10 greatest fights of all time .

"Washington (CNN) -- The White House position on extraterrestrials is now clear: aliens haven't contacted Earth, but that doesn't mean the U.S. government isn't looking for them. ""The U.S. government has no evidence that any life exists outside our planet, or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race,"" wrote Phil Larson of the White House Office of Science & Technology Policy in a blog post on the White House website. The response went on to say that even though there is no proof that life exists outside Earth, ""that doesn't mean the subject of life outside our planet isn't being discussed or explored,"" he said . The petitions were submitted through ""We the People,"" a White House initiative that promises a White House response to any petition that can garner 5,000 signatures in 30 days. This response by the White House satisfies the demands of two petitions, one of which garnered over 12,000 signatures. That petition called on the White House to ""formally acknowledge an extraterrestrial presence engaging the human race."" ""Hundreds of military and government agency witnesses have come forward with testimony confirming this extraterrestrial presence,"" stated the petition. ""Opinion polls now indicate more than 50% of the American people believe there is an extraterrestrial presence and more than 80% believe the government is not telling the truth about this phenomenon. The people have a right to know. The people can handle the truth."" According to the White House, however, ""there is no credible information to suggest that any evidence is being hidden from the public's eye."" But Larson indicated that a host of government agencies are working ""toward the goal of understanding if life can or does exist off Earth,"" including the Mars Science Laboratory, SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence and Kepler, the NASA spacecraft. And even though the White House was clear that there is no credible evidence that aliens have contacted earth, Larson did point out that the odds are in favor of extraterrestrial existence, but not contact. ""Many scientists and mathematicians... have come to the conclusion that the odds are pretty high that somewhere among the trillions and trillions of stars in the universe there is a planet other than ours that is home to life,"" wrote Larson. ""However, that the odds of us making contact with any of them â€” especially any intelligent ones â€” are extremely small, given the distances involved.""","The White House says extraterrestrials have not contacted the human race .

"(CNN) -- ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3"" continues the franchise's tradition of high action, detailed fighting and a highly competitive multiplayer mode while still trying to let players play the way they want. The latest in the wildly successful series hits all the right notes in both its cinematic single-player campaign and its intense multiplayer mode. They also bring back the ""Special Ops"" mode from ""Modern Warfare 2,"" combining the best of both. The single-player campaign, while short, takes you hopping around the globe to major cities in the world's most powerful countries. Instead of battling in traditional hotspots (i.e., locales like Afghanistan), the story puts the player in Manhattan, London and Berlin to name a few. Each city is richly detailed and the combat, against opponents run by a smart artificial-intelligence program, is intense. The pacing from city to city varies based on mission and storyline presented in each location. One city will be frantic while another city might be a bit slower. But all are engaging. There are some unexpected, and tragic, moments played out in the single-player campaign's story. But they combine to bring the ""Modern Warfare"" story to a satisfying end. I wish it would have lasted longer, but the plot flowed nicely. The ""Special Ops"" mode takes the intense AI from the single-player game and adds elements that are usually found in multiplayer action. Creative strategist Robert Bowling said the development team wanted to give people who normally only tackle the single-player campaign the opportunity to experience some of the rewards only found during online multiplayer play. ""We noticed there were a lot of experiences that you were missing out on if you only played single player or, vice versa, you only played multiplayer,"" Bowling said. ""We wanted to find a platform that allowed the type of player from each of those to have those shared experiences rather than missing out because it wasn't their style of play."" Sixteen missions tie in to the campaign. Along the way, players earn credit for achievements like kill streaks and customizing weapons. There's a progressive ranking system that lets even the most ""lone wolf"" player climb up the leaderboard. The Survival mode is particularly grueling, with wave after wave of opponents coming after you. The core of the multiplayer action stays pretty true to the franchise's roots. Huge battles, lots of action and an experience-point system keep players involved and interested. Most of the modes remain the same with one new additional mode. Collecting tags from dead bodies adds a cool twist to straightforward killing of an opponent and actually promotes teamwork, something that's lacking from time to time in multiplayer action. There are 16 new maps to set the scene of your victories. Bowling said there are 30 million players who have played ""Call of Duty"" online and a new Elite program will help provide stats, tips and bring together the franchise community without dividing them among consoles. He also tweeted on Day One that the game's makers have already had to ban gamers from leaderboards -- and from playing altogether -- for trying to play unfairly or artificially boost their rankings. While the multiplayer mode hasn't changed much, it never really needed to. The ""Modern Warfare"" franchise has a great track record of addictive online play that remains enjoyable and exciting. Fast and furious multiplayer action, a cinematic single-player campaign and a Special Ops mode offering the experience of both takes ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3"" to the top of the class. At least until the next one comes out. ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3"" is available now for the PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It is rated M for mature due to blood and gore, drug references, intense violence and strong language. This review was done using the Xbox 360 version.","The single player campaign puts you in places such as Manhattan, London and Berlin .

"(CNN) -- Left-leaning Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega easily won re-election with more than double the votes of his closest rival, election officials said on Monday, amid complaints of voting irregularities. With 85% of the ballots counted, the incumbent had 62.6% of the vote, versus Fabio Gadea's 30.9%. ""I want to congratulate the current president,"" Roberto Rivas, president of the Supreme Electoral Council (CSE), told reporters. Opposition leaders have criticized Sunday's vote and Gadea, Ortega's closest rival, refused to accept the results. He was known until recently as a radio-station owner and journalist and as creator of the popular Nicaraguan radio character ""Pancho Madrigal."" ""We can't accept the results presented by the CSE as they don't reflect the will of the people,"" Gadea said. According to opposition leader Eliseo Nunez of the Liberal Independent Party, 20% of election observers had been stopped from entering polling stations. ""This has been a process plagued with irregularities,"" he said. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland similarly weighed in Monday on reports of procedural irregularities and voter intimidation. ""Frankly, if the Nicaraguan government had nothing to hide, it should have allowed a broad compliment of international monitors,"" she told reporters in Washington. Placing third, with 6% of votes, was former President Arnoldo Aleman. He was convicted of corruption during his term and sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2003, but in a controversial 2009 decision, the nation's top court overturned the conviction. Nicaragua's constitution bars presidents from being re-elected, but that did not stop Ortega from running in his sixth straight presidential race. Supporters of the president celebrated what was then his apparent re-election victory in the streets of the country's capital Sunday night. He was first elected as president in 1984, and ran unsuccessfully in 1990, 1996 and 2001 before being elected again in 2006. Ortega is known as an ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and was a public supporter of former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi during the Libyan uprising. But recently he has reached for the middle, making overtures to the business class and promising to lure foreign investors into the country. ""Our government program is the one in practice now and the one we have to improve, strengthen (and) develop,"" Ortega said recently. For his supporters, re-election guarantees that social and economic programs will continue. They want to see more investment in infrastructure and technology, and more public housing, projects often financed through Venezuela. Ortega came to power as part of the Sandinista rebels who overthrew the Somoza dynasty in 1979. He represents the Sandinista National Liberation Front. His detractors accuse Ortega of having too much influence over the Supreme Electoral Council and the Supreme Court of Justice, which allowed his candidacy. Yet his popular support remains high, particularly among the country's youth. ""The level of support shows a bit of a new generation that does not know the experience of the past, of 30 years ago, of the war that happened in Nicaragua,"" said Manuel Orozco, a senior associate at the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue. CNN's Lucia Navarro and Jack Maddox contributed to this report.","NEW: Daniel Ortega is declared the winner with more than double his closest rival's votes .

"(CNN) -- Federal health officials are expanding efforts to ensure no additional bacteria-tainted cantaloupes get to consumers in what has become the deadliest U.S. outbreak of a food-borne illness in more than a decade. The Food and Drug Administration said it has teamed up with state officials in the effort. ""FDA and its state partners are conducting checks at retail stores, wholesalers and distributors to make sure they have received notification about the Jensen Farms' whole cantaloupe recall and that they have taken appropriate action to notify their customers and remove the recalled whole cantaloupes from the shelves,"" the agency said in a statement Wednesday. Thirteen people have died in what has become the deadliest U.S. outbreak of a food-borne illness since 1998, according to records from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The outbreak -- blamed on the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes -- was first reported September 12. It was traced to consumption of Rocky Ford cantaloupes grown at Jensen Farms' fields in Granada, Colorado. What you need to know about Listeria . As of Monday, it had grown to 18 states, 72 illnesses and 13 deaths, according to the CDC's latest statistics. ""Because some of the wholesalers and distributors may have further distributed the recalled cantaloupes to food processors, it is possible that additional products that contain cantaloupe from Jensen Farms could be recalled,"" the FDA said. ""There is no indication of foreign distribution at this time."" In 1998, 21 people died from consuming tainted hot dogs, according to a CDC database. Food poisoning 101 . In the current outbreak, four people who ate contaminated cantaloupes died in New Mexico, two each in Colorado and Texas, and one each in Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. Public health officials also have reported illnesses in California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, North Dakota, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Listeria can grow even at low temperatures and can also can take three weeks or longer to make a person sick, so more cases may emerge in the coming weeks, officials said. Listeriosis causes fever, muscle aches, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms. It is rarely a serious concern for healthy children and adults, according to the CDC, but it is particularly dangerous for older adults, people with weakened immune systems. In pregnant women, it can cause miscarriages, stillbirth and premature delivery. Pregnant women may experience only mild flu-like symptoms, said Dr. David Acheson, a former chief medical officer for the FDA who is now the managing director for food and import safety practice at Leavitt Partners, a firm which advises clients on health care and food safety. Listeria can be devastating to a fetus, he said, particularly in the second or third trimesters, so pregnant women who may have been exposed and have any flu-like symptoms should see a doctor. Symptoms can be more pronounced in the elderly or those with compromised immune systems, he said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A man wounded Friday when a gunman opened fire at passing vehicles along a downtown street in Hollywood has died, a spokeswoman at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles said Monday. John Atterberry died shortly before 5 p.m. Monday, according to Simi Singer, the hospital spokeswoman. The music-industry executive was shot in the jaw at Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street. The gunman, 26-year-old Tyler Brehm, went on the rampage that ended with his being fatally shot by police, Los Angeles police spokeswoman Sgt. Mitzi Fierro has said. An amateur video captured the scene of Brehm walking down Sunset Boulevard wielding a handgun and firing at vehicles, seemingly at random. Brehm fired a ""significant number"" of rounds, police said. He then returned to an intersection, where he was confronted by a plainclothes police detective and an off-duty police officer working on a nearby movie set, officials said. ""At that point the police ordered him to drop his weapon and he pointed his gun at the police and an officer-involved shooting occurred,"" Fierro said. Brehm died later at a nearby hospital, according to a police statement. Christopher Johns recorded much of the incident from his apartment window and can be heard shouting at Brehm throughout. ""Why don't you come up here?"" he yelled, later telling CNN that he intended to distract the gunman. At one point, Brehm spoke with Johns, asking him for ammunition and to call an ambulance. Fierro said it appeared Johns could interact with the suspect without jeopardizing his safety. ""It appears from the video that he was able to distract the suspect and keep him from shooting at additional people before the police arrived,"" she said. Police have not indicated that they know Brehm's motive. Two others suffered minor injuries. Witnesses were stunned by the shooting spree. Amy Torgeson told CNN affiliate KABC that vehicles began ""swerving and braking,"" and she sought cover at a nearby bank. ""A car drove by and he just shot right into the car,"" Torgeson said. ""He was just shooting everywhere."" CNN's Regina Graham contributed to this report.","John Atterberry died around 5 p.m. Monday, a Cedars-Sinai spokeswoman says .

"New York (CNN) -- As the Occupy Wall Street movement grew and touched even more U.S. cities Saturday, the mayor of the city where it began blasted many involved and claimed they were targeting the nation's financial sector and ""trying to destroy the jobs of working people"" in New York City. The protest effort continued into its 22nd day in New York on Saturday. Yet its spread well beyond that city, with its anti-corporation, anti-government message echoing in many places this weekend -- from Cleveland to Las Vegas, from Washington to Prescott, Arizona. Open Story: See iReports from the protests. Yet this growing fervor has been met, in some cases, by vocal commentary. That includes New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who in a WOR radio appearance Friday said that city's labor unions -- many of whom swelled demonstrator ranks earlier this week -- depend on salaries that ""come from the taxes paid by the people they're trying to vilify."" The mayor did describe the city's unemployment rate as ""unacceptably high,"" and acknowledged that ""a lot of people are disaffected."" ""Some are legit, some aren't,"" Bloomberg said, describing the concerns of the demonstrators in Lower Manhattan. His comments coincided with the city's announcement that 700 education workers will be laid off in an effort to close a budget gap. They also follow recently released census data that shows New York's poverty level has increased to 20.1%, the highest in more than a decade. The remarks drew criticism from Tyler Combelic, a spokesman for Occupy Wall Street, who claimed Bloomberg ""hasn't really represented all of New Yorkers."" ""The fact is there are thousands and thousands of us out on the streets, and he's not really recognizing that we're a movement,"" Combelic told CNN on Saturday. ""We should be heard by New York politicians."" On Saturday, New York protesters set up a second base at Washington Square Park. The park in Greenwich Village is about two miles north of Zuccotti Park, a private park that's been considered the main rallying point for the largely leaderless movement in the city. A rally was held in Washington Square, followed by a now-customary people's assembly to discuss the movement and an art show Saturday evening. Demonstrators won't stay overnight at Washington Square Park, unlike Zuccotti, because it is a municipal park with a midnight curfew. As of 9 p.m., the New York Police Department did not report any related arrests. The ambiguously defined movement against corporate greed and other social ills has spread to more than a dozen cities, spurred lately by support from unions and other groups. ""Social and economic inequalities are the tipping point, and people are hungry for getting involved and trying to do something to change it,"" Jim Nichols, who has been involved in Occupy Atlanta protests, told CNN on Saturday. ""It's almost like, I want the American dream back."" Even before Bloomberg's comments Saturday, the effort was stirring a growing number of strong reactions from public figures. President Barack Obama, even as he defended the need for a vibrant financial sector, acknowledged that the protesters ""are giving voice to a more broad-based frustration about how our financial system works."" The No. 2 Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, Eric Cantor, meanwhile, slammed what he called the ""growing mobs"" who he claimed were ""pitting ... Americans against Americans."" On Saturday, U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel backed the demonstrators -- whom he has been visiting regularly over the past three weeks -- for venting their frustrations and exercising their constitutional rights. ""Their dreams are being shattered,"" Rangel told CNN's Don Lemon. ""They may be an inconvenience to a whole lot of people in that area, but people are going to sleep at night with an economic nightmare."" The New York Democrat urged ""more spiritual leaders"" to join a movement he claimed championed the poor and disadvantaged, saying ""there's no moral reason why they have to wait for something to catch on."" He also dismissed criticism that the demonstrators don't have a coherent purpose, saying despite their varied issues and lack of organization, their sentiments are raw and real. ""They don't have to know what the solution is,"" he said. ""There's one thing they know is (there's) something wrong when so many people are out of work, and we find the disparity with the very rich. ... Something is wrong."" Combelic, the New York spokesman, said the movement chiefly is trying to showcase ""active democracy and (show that) everyone has a voice in government."" He said the protests -- which have been associated with progressive causes -- are ""a rebuke of government, that includes the left and the right."" ""We're trying to broaden the discussion base. ... We're trying to represent 99% of the country that's felt disenfranchised over the past five years because of the recession,"" Combelic said. ""(Politicians) have not come together, they've not compromised on anything, and there's a reason why there's (low) congressional approval in this country."" The demonstrations have been largely peaceful. But in New York, some have been marred by scuffles with police. Last Saturday, police made hundreds of arrests as demonstrators marched without a permit toward the Brooklyn Bridge, blocking city traffic for hours. A week earlier, authorities detained dozens of protesters as they marched, also without a permit, through Manhattan's financial district toward Union Square.

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. Air Force investigators found ""serious misconduct"" in the handling of remains of the nation's war dead at the Dover Air Force Base Mortuary, the Office of Special Counsel said Tuesday. At a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz referred to ""gross mismanagement"" in some aspects of the mortuary's operations. Schwartz said Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has appointed a panel to review operations at the Dover mortuary. ""What I want to talk about is tough stuff. Given the context of this, if I find difficulty in finding the right words, you'll understand,"" Schwartz said at the news conference. The findings came after the Air Force conducted a year-long investigation into 14 allegations of wrongdoing made by whistleblowers involving the remains of four U.S. service members killed in action, the Pentagon official said. Although some of the specific allegations were not substantiated, the official said several cases of concern were confirmed, including: . -- Several instances in which portions of remains from troops killed in action were lost or unaccounted for. It included losing an ankle that had been in storage and some bags that held other body parts and remains. -- The body of a dead Marine being prepared for viewing by his family had a badly-damaged arm sawed off because it could not be arranged suitably for viewing purposes. The bone had fused at a 90-degree angle, according to officials. The report said Quinton Keel, a Dover mortician, had the arm sawed off without consulting the Marine's family. The Air Force found no wrongdoing and officials say preparing badly damaged bodies can be very difficult. But the federal Office of Special Counsel, which also investigated the matter, said the family should have been notified, according to a statement issued by that office Tuesday. -- A Pentagon official confirmed that elements of the Army and Air Force were criticized for shipping fetal remains from military families to Dover in cardboard boxes. At his news conference, Schwartz said the investigation began after allegations from three employees ""became known to us."" He did not identify the employees or their positions. But the report from the Office of Special Counsel identified the three as James Parsons, Mary Ellen Spera, and William Zwicharowski. The Air Force said all three are still employed by Dover Air Force Base. ""The fundamental result of the investigation was that senior Air Force mortuary operations affairs officials did not meet standards in that they failed to act with clear indications that processes and procedures ... were inadequate to ensure accountability of remains,"" Schwartz said. He said among their findings, investigators ""concluded that the loss of two specific portions of remains constituted gross mismanagement."" Those two cases involved the remains of an Army soldier and those of an Air Force airman. ""In one case we have reason to believe that the remains were properly disposed of; in the second case, we cannot make that argument. It is simply unknown what happened to the second set of remains,"" Schwartz said. ""This gross mismanagement dealt with the fact that ... supervisors, of which there were three, failed to properly perceive and then act upon ... clear indications that there were systemic issues with respect to accountability of remains in the mortuary."" A Defense Department official confirmed that Keel, a civilian, was demoted to a non-supervisory job and now works in another area at Dover outside the mortuary. Another civilian, Trevor Dean, a mortician and funeral director there, has been transferred to a non-supervisory job. Col. Robert Edmonson, the mortuary commander between January 2009 and October 2010 when the incident occurred, was issued a letter of reprimand, which is usually a career-ending move. Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner said the Air Force hasn't taken ""sufficient disciplinary action against the officials responsible for wrongdoing,"" the OSC statement said. But Schwartz said that he did not believe the situations cited in the report were intentional. He emphasized that ""this was difficult work, 24/7. And while their performance did not meet standards, this was not a deliberate act, in my personal view."" The Air Force said it is improving procedures at Dover but admitted that ""the mortuary staff failed to maintain accountability while processing remains for three service members."" ""While it is likely that the disposition of remains was by appropriate method, it could not be shown that it was in accordance with the families' directions,"" the Air Force said in a statement. Panetta noted that ""one of the Department's most sacred responsibilities is ensuring that the remains of our fallen heroes are recovered and returned to their families with the honor and dignity they have earned. ""I was deeply disturbed to learn about questions involving the possibilities of improper handling and preparation of remains of four service members at the Air Force's Dover Port Mortuary,"" Panetta said in a statement. The Office of Special Counsel -- an independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency -- said that while the Air Force investigation ""confirmed most of the whistleblower's factual allegations,"" it ""nonetheless failed to admit wrongdoing."" ""The Air Force did, however, respond positively by changing numerous practices at the mortuary,"" the OSC said in a statement. The OSC said that in the incidents in which ""three body parts of service members killed while on active duty were lost by the Port Mortuary,"" the Air Force acknowledged its ""negligent failure,"" but ""still concluded that there was no obligation to notify the families."" The families of the fallen whose remains were not properly handled were first notified of the investigation, and the results of the probe, over the past weekend. Gen. Schwartz said Tuesday regarding the timing of the informing the families, ""We waited until it was clear that the Office of Special Counsel was going to render their report, we got 48 hours notice and we acted upon that notice."" The OSC also criticized the handling of some fetal remains from military families that ""were shipped to Dover inside plastic pails, which were in turn placed in non-reinforced, used cardboard boxes, even though military guidelines require that remains be treated with 'reverence, care and dignity.' ""The Air Force acknowledged that this handling was 'substandard' and that it 'wasn't very dignified,' but nevertheless said the remains were afforded the requisite reverence, care and dignity,"" the OSC statement said. The remains of those killed in Iraq and Afghanistan have regularly been flown to Dover since the wars began. More than 6,300 deceased individuals have been returned there. Due to combat injuries, remains are often difficult to identify and officials have long acknowledged that Dover does retain some human remains and parts that are so damaged they are not possible to identify. During his tenure as defense secretary, Robert Gates allowed the media for the first time to attend some return-of-remains ceremonies with the permission of the service members' families. President Barack Obama has also attended ceremonies at Dover. Lerner said the OSC was investigating claims by three of the whistleblowers that the Air Force retaliated against them for bringing up the problems, in one case attempting to terminate the employment of one of them. ""The mortuary for the United State military should boast the best conditions and best practices of any mortuary,"" Lerner said. ""These events are deeply troubling, as is the Air Force's failure to acknowledge culpability."" In a letter to Obama, the OSC said the report ""demonstrates a pattern of the Air Force's failure to acknowledge culpability for wrongdoing relating to the treatment of remains of service members and their dependents. While the report reflects a willingness to find paperwork violations and errors, with the exception of the cases of missing portions, the findings stop short of accepting accountability for failing to handle remains with the requisite 'reverence, care, and dignity befitting them and the circumstances.'"" The Air Force has contacted families of the war dead and Schwartz has asked Panetta for an independent assessment of mortuary operations at Dover. Former Surgeon General Richard Carmona will lead that investigation and provide a report to Panetta within 60 days. Schwartz said that he and Air Force Secretary Michael Donley ""have taken personal responsibility for this."" ""I want to assure our men and women in uniform, and the American public, that the Air Force mortuary standards they expect for our fallen heroes are being met,"" Schwartz said in a statement. The Air Force has set up a toll free number for the families of fallen service members to call if they have questions about the investigation. They can call 1 855 637 2583 or e-mail dover.pm@pentagon.af.mil. CNN's Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report.","The mortuary at Dover Air Force Base handles returning war dead .

"(CNN) -- The Virginia Tech community on Monday remembered Deriek Crouse, the police officer who was gunned down last week while conducting a routine traffic stop on campus. The funeral service for Crouse, 39, was held at Cassell Coliseum, near where authorities say he was shot dead Thursday by Ross Truett Ashley. A witness saw Ashley approach the officer's vehicle -- where Crouse was at the time -- and open fire, then flee the scene, police said. The 22-year-old shooter, who was not involved in the traffic stop and had no connection with Crouse before the shooting, killed himself about 30 minutes later a quarter of a mile away, authorities said. ""He was a lifelong public servant,"" Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell said of Crouse at Monday's service. ""For the last four years, he went to work here protecting the citizens of the state and the students and the faculty and the administrators of Virginia Tech, swearing the oath of the Constitution, strapping on his gun, putting on his badge and doing a police officer's duty."" Crouse, an Army veteran, joined the Virginia Tech police force six months after a 2007 mass shooting on the Virginia Tech campus, according to the school's website. He had worked at the New River Valley jail and with the Montgomery County Sheriff's Department. Crouse was trained as a crisis intervention officer, firearms instructor and defensive tactics instructor. The Christiansburg, Virginia, resident is survived by his wife, Tina, plus five children and stepchildren, his mother and brother. Students, supporters and others affiliated with Virginia Tech have championed Crouse's memory since his death, including making attempts to help his family.

"Memphis, Tennessee (CNN) -- The leader of a Memphis-based YMCA group said he felt ""gut-punched"" by a televised report in which two men alleged a former coach with that organization had sexually abused them as boys. Keith Johnson, the president and CEO of the YMCA of Memphis and the Mid-South, said he first heard of the allegations against Robert ""Bobby"" Dodd while watching ESPN's ""Outside the Lines"" program on Sunday. He said the sports network didn't contact him in advance of the piece. As of Monday, several days after Memphis Police Director Toney Armstrong announced his department would investigate the claims against Dodd, Johnson said that law enforcement had not touched base with his YMCA organization. In the ESPN report, Dodd's accusers said he sexually abused them in hotel rooms during tournaments when they were 12 to 16 years old. CNN has not been able to reach Dodd, 63, for comment on the allegations. ESPN said it also had been unable to reach him. On Monday afternoon, Memphis police Deputy Chief Dave Martello said the investigators' options are limited given that no one has filed a formal complaint against Dodd. ""A person is going to have to actually come to the police and report this,"" Martello told reporters. ""The fact they go on TV and make these accusations is not notifying the authorities."" Martello said police are still trying to determine ""where (the alleged crimes) happened, when they happened and who was involved."" But if a person doesn't offer details directly to police, there are only ""going to be a lot of baby steps,"" he said. Dodd, who is not a direct relative of the late former Georgia Tech football coach of the same name, was a basketball coach affiliated with the Memphis YMCA in the 1980s, Johnson confirmed. Two now grown men alleged in the ESPN report that Dodd abused them during that time. The allegations were made amid child sex scandals at Penn State and Syracuse universities and The Citadel. Both men accusing Dodd told ESPN the publicity from the scandals prompted them to act. The YMCA said Dodd left in 1992 ""to pursue AAU sports full-time,"" including founding an organization called the YOMCA, which stands for Youth of Memphis Competitive Association and is unrelated to the YMCA. He eventually became president and CEO of the Amateur Athletic Union, a position he held until his dismissal on November 14. Johnson came to Memphis as head of the Fogelman Downtown YMCA a year after Dodd left. In his time with the organization, including over the last decade as an executive for the regional YMCA, Johnson said he had never heard complaints regarding the former coach. Martello said that Memphis police began looking into the case after the AAU gave them information last Friday. AAU spokesman Ron Sachs had also said that his organization kick-started the child sex abuse criminal probe -- although the group has varied as to whether it claims to have contacted authorities last Thursday or Friday -- telling CNN that the organization provided the identities of three of Dodd's accusers, including not brought up in the ESPN report. This disclosure followed a nearly monthlong investigation ordered by the AAU, Sachs said Sunday. The AAU got ""cryptic, brief"" e-mails, signed only as ""shrimp breath,"" on November 7, 8 and 9 that ""alleged, in a very general way, that Bobby Dodd engaged in child sexual abuse,"" Sachs said. On November 9, the organization got two brief voice-mails along the same lines. There was no name or contact information left in either case. Those messages were sent to the AAU's compliance and general counsel office, and AAU officers were notified on November 11. The board members, several of whom flew into Orlando, convened the next Monday, November 14, ""to confront then-President Bobby Dodd,"" said Sachs. In that meeting, Dodd said he had gotten similar phone messages and said he was innocent, according to Sachs, who said he had spoken with several AAU officers who were at the meeting. ""Despite those denials, the AAU officers directed that Bobby Dodd leave the premises and leave his position (as president and CEO) for an indefinite period,"" said Sachs. The YMCA of Memphis and the Mid-South and the AAU have launched independent investigations into the matter, their respective leaders have said. One of Dodd's accusers, identified by ESPN as Ralph West of Miami, said he was 14 at the time of the alleged abuse. He said that he was talking publicly, despite the potential embarrassment to him and his family, not to ""gain anything"" but because he felt ""the guy shouldn't be around kids anymore."" West said that he was on a YMCA basketball team run by Dodd, who he said would sometimes slip into his then player's hotel room. Asked how Dodd could have entered the hotel room on that and other occasions, West said, ""He had a key. He always somehow had a key to whatever room I was in."" West said Dodd abused him or tried to abuse him six times, including at least once in which he tried ""to put his hand in my boxer shorts"" while West was sleeping. During out-of-town basketball tournaments, West said that he tried to find ways to keep Dodd out of his hotel room,, adding he was ""afraid to even fall asleep."" ""He would push his way in the room and then end up, I'd see, I wouldn't see him, I would hear him, he'd lay at the floor of the bed masturbating,"" West said. ""And you just lay there horrified. But you don't know what to do. What, are you going to blow the lid off of this at 14 years? All you want to do is pretend it didn't happen and not address it at all. You want to hide and bury it."" Another accuser, whom ESPN did not identify, said Dodd gave him alcohol before taking him to a bedroom and touching him inappropriately. ""The last thing that I can really remember was him carrying me into his bedroom and I can remember him, you know, touching me in ways that I, I didn't uh, I didn't want another man touching me,"" the man said. That accuser said he called Dodd on November 11 and confronted him. Dodd, he said, then apologized for the alleged abuse. The network said it examined the man's phone records and verified an eight-minute phone call to Dodd's number. Both men said they had never reported the alleged incidents to police and had only recently told their families, ESPN said. Until they or other accusers contact Memphis police, Martello said investigators can only work from the limited information they've been given by the AAU. ""We're just going to have to go with the facts, as they come forward,"" he said. The statute of limitations, which mandates that charges cannot be filed for a crime if a certain amount of time has elapsed since it allegedly took place, could be a factor in the case. Shelby County District Attorney General Amy Weirich on Monday said such laws are ""very technical"" and ""very confusing,"" declining to go into details as to how it would apply in this case lest that would prevent complainants from talking to police. ""What we don't want to do is encourage made-up claims or discourage valid claims to be made to the Memphis Police Department,"" Weirich told reporters, encouraging victims of any crime to contact police and not worry about the statute of limitations. Sachs criticized the half-hour ESPN report for not quoting AAU President Louis Stout's video statement on the matter or others from the AAU. The organization, which has 80,000 adult volunteers involved in coaching and works with hundreds of thousands of young people, is asking outside experts to review its policies for protecting children, which Sachs called the AAU's ""No. 1 priority."" The spokesman also clarified that Dodd told his successor, Stout, that he had colon cancer and needed surgery after his dismissal. Dodd allegedly asked that he be able to retire for medical reasons, a request that Stout denied, according to Sachs. ""(Stout) told Mr. Dodd to go focus on your health, go through this surgery and we'll deal with this issue later,"" said Sachs. Dodd has been back at the AAU's offices one time since his ouster, contrary to the organization's earlier reports that he had not returned. The occasion was a ""forensic audit"" that Sachs called standard for outgoing leaders of organizations. ""Bobby Dodd is no longer part of the AAU,"" said Sachs. ""He has no continuing role (or) involvement in their programs. There's no contact with him. Whatever compensation he would have been entitled to -- accrued vacation time -- will be paid, and that's it.""","Memphis police says no accusers have contacted them, making their probe challenging .

"(CNN) -- Despite the worldwide economic downturn it seems there is one commodity that remains as valuable as ever. With media companies around the world paying record sums for broadcasting rights, the English Premier League -- with its array of world-class players -- continues to  prove a hugely marketable. Manchester United won an English Premier League competition that was beamed into 600m homes. With the new 2009-2010 football season approaching, the Premier League appears to have usurped every other domestic league as the sporting product of choice for most international broadcasters. The fact that companies are still willing to hang their financial hats on the Premier League, despite increased global uncertainty, is a testament to the large audiences the thrills and excitement of the competition can draw. And, with the division's international broadcasting rights for the next three years currently up for tender, there appears no sign that financial constraints are hindering the bidding process. A Premier League spokesman told CNN: ""Currently we have 39 international rights broadcast holders, beaming the Premier League into 211 countries worldwide. ""Premier League matches are played into 600 million homes around the world, with an estimated audience of four billion viewers and there is no sign that the huge interest in the product is subsiding in any way."" The spokesman added: ""The quality of the Premier League stimulates interest to markets everywhere and attracts audiences from all over the globe. ""It's a very polished product. The grounds are full, the atmosphere is passionate and the top clubs attract supporters from every corner of the globe. ""If broadcasters are going to invest in any sporting property, they are going to choose the one that brings in the biggest audiences, which in turn makes it the most attractive for advertisers."" The Premier League is touted by many as the ""most competitive"" in Europe, but pinning all you financial strategy on one product is a dangerous game -- as one broadcaster recently found to its cost. Ireland-based broadcaster Setanta, which also had major audiences in Great Britain and the United States, had an impressive portfolio of sporting rights and events at its disposal. But the company's purchase of 46 Premier League matches, for £131 million ($215m) was the centerpiece of its coverage for two seasons -- a figure they hoped to recoup from customer subscriptions. But when the company lost the rights to half of their games, meaning they could show only 23 matches of the upcoming campaign the British operation was forced to cease trading due to a projected loss in subscriptions. American broadcaster, ESPN, quickly snapped up the rights in a bid to increase their market share, a policy that makes sense according to football business expert Michael Stirling, of sport sponsorship company Global Sponsors. ""Not only is the quality of the product excellent, but the fact that the Premier League is full of players from all over the world makes it both viable and successful,"" Stirling said. ""Unlike some other major leagues, it is not a foregone conclusion who wins the Premier League. There is a greater distribution of top players across the teams than in any other league and that makes it both interesting and exciting. ""In recent seasons we have seen the growth in popularity in Asia and Africa. In the past, countries like China have tried to down-play the Premier League in an attempt to promote their own domestic competitions. ""However, the demand and popularity of the league has been too great for these countries not to broadcast matches, and now they embrace it completely.""","The English Premier League's international rights are currently up for tender .

"(CNN) -- Syria's President Bashar al-Assad ""must step aside,"" European Union foreign ministers said in a blistering statement Monday, adding the Syrian government's crackdown on anti-government protesters may amount to crimes against humanity. The EU also expanded sanctions on Iran and Belarus to protest their crackdowns on their citizens, it announced. But the 27 foreign ministers of the union reserved their sharpest criticism for Syria and its president. ""The EU condemns in the strongest possible terms the ongoing brutal repression led by the Syrian regime,"" they said after a meeting in Luxembourg. Syria's leader must resign ""to allow a political transition to take place in Syria,"" they said. And they welcomed the creation of the umbrella opposition Syrian National Council, a day after Syria's foreign minister warned other nations against recognizing it. The ministers said they were ""deeply disappointed"" that the United Nations Security Council failed to increase sanctions on Syria -- a milder statement than had been expected. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said the union would continue to press for strong action on Syria. The harsh words on Syria follow last week's failure by the U.N. Security Council to agree on a resolution calling for an immediate end to a military crackdown against opponents of President al-Assad. China and Russia opposed the resolution, which was supported by the EU's Great Britain and France as well as the United States. Al-Assad has been under international pressure to end a seven-month crackdown on demonstrators calling for the end to his regime. The European Union has slapped Syria with a number of sanctions, including barring the import of Syrian oil and banning the delivery of Syrian currency produced in the EU to the Syrian Central Bank. It also has placed travel restrictions on and frozen the assets of officials it says are involved in the attacks on the opposition. The European Union is also expanding its sanctions on Iran in light of ""growing concern about the human rights situation"" there, Ashton announced Monday. She expressed concern about ""repression of citizens and human rights defenders, journalists, women activists, minority groups, members of the opposition."" She called on Iran to ""fully respect the rights of their people."" Iran was already under EU economic and trade sanctions related to its nuclear program. Ashton said the union was continuing to talk to Tehran about its controversial nuclear ambitions. The EU also renewed and expanded sanctions on Belarus. Nearly 200 people were already subject to an asset freeze and travel ban over the ""crackdown on civil society and democratic opposition"" after the last two presidential elections. The EU added three companies and 16 individuals to the list of those facing restrictions, and it extended the existing restrictions until the end of October 2012, it announced. It is expected to name them on Tuesday. The ministers extended the visa ban and asset freeze on 192 people in Belarus who the EU maintains are responsible for political repression and ""violations of the international electoral standards"" in the former Soviet republic's 2006 and 2010 presidential elections. The sanctions were imposed against Belarus following the December 2010 presidential election that saw the re-election of President Alexander Lukashenko amid allegations of widespread electoral fraud. The government cracked down on mass protests following the election, including the beating and jailing of former presidential candidate Uladzimir Nyaklyaeu. Other political figures and journalists also were jailed. The ministers also expressed support for Libya's interim government. Ashton said the existing EU office in Tripoli would soon become ""a fully-fledged EU delegation."" CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","NEW: The European Union expands sanctions against Iran over human rights .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Norio Ohga, the former president and chairman of Sony Corporation who helped to develop the compact disc, died Saturday of multiple organ failure, the company said. He was 81. Ohga worked for what is now Sony as a consultant and adviser while still a music student in Tokyo, before joining the company full time in 1959. He rose to the ranks of chairman and president and is credited with driving the company's growth in movies, video games and music. Ohga saw the potential of the compact disc early and spearheaded Sony's efforts in that area, the company said. His training as a musician led him to push for a 12-centimeter format, providing enough storage to allow listeners to hear all of Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony without interruption, according to Sony. Those specifications are still in use today. The company sold the world's first CD in 1982 and within five years, CD sales overtook LP record sales in Japan. Ohga is also credited with launching Sony's game business and was head of Sony when it bought Columbia Pictures in 1989. He was a senior adviser to Sony at the time of his death. ""By redefining Sony as a company encompassing both hardware and software, Ohga-san succeeded where other Japanese companies failed. It is no exaggeration to attribute Sony's evolution beyond audio and video products into music, movies and games, and subsequent transformation into a global entertainment leader to Ohga-san's foresight and vision,"" Sony Chief Executive Howard Stringer said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- Brett Ratner has resigned as a producer of this year's Academy Awards show for an anti-gay remark he made over the weekend, the movie director said Tuesday in an open letter to his colleagues. ""Over the last few days, I've gotten a well-deserved earful from many of the people I admire most in this industry expressing their outrage and disappointment over the hurtful and stupid things I said in a number of recent media appearances,"" Ratner said in the letter, which was given to CNN by his representative, Allan Mayer. ""To them, and to everyone I've hurt and offended, I'd like to apologize publicly and unreservedly."" Ratner met with the representatives of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation prior to announcing his resignation, GLAAD said in a news release Tuesday. When asked during a question-and-answer session about his newly released action comedy, ""Tower Heist,"" whether he rehearses with his actors before shooting a scene, Ratner replied, ""Rehearsing is for f*gs,"" GLAAD said in its release, citing New York Magazine's Vulture blog. ""When we sat down with Brett today, he seemed very sincere in his desire to use this experience as a way to begin speaking out against anti-gay language in popular culture,"" said Herndon Graddick, senior director of programs and communications at GLAAD. ""We believe his resignation is just the first step and will be announcing a series of concrete actions with Brett in coming days and weeks."" In his statement Tuesday, Ratner said ""it pains me deeply that I may have hurt"" his colleagues who ""are members of the LGBT community."" ""Having love in your heart doesn't count for much if what comes out of your mouth is ugly and bigoted,"" Ratner said. ""With this in mind, and to all those who understandably feel that apologies are not enough, please know that I will be taking real action over the coming weeks and months in an effort to do everything I can both professionally and personally to help stamp out the kind of thoughtless bigotry I've so foolishly perpetuated."" Ratner said he had called Tom Sherak, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, to resign as the producer of the Academy Awards show. ""Being asked to help put on the Oscar show was the proudest moment of my career,"" Ratner said. ""But as painful as this may be for me, it would be worse if my association with the show were to be a distraction from the Academy and the high ideals it represents.""

"(CNN) -- Jonny Wilkinson, who enshrined his name in rugby history with his match-winning drop-goal in the 2003 World Cup final, has announced the end of his international career. The flyhalf struggled to regain the giddy heights of that day in Sydney, when England won the sport's biggest prize for the first time, as he suffered frustrating injury setbacks in the following years. The 32-year-old was one of many England players to struggle at this year's tournament, which ended in a quarterfinal exit to France and the subsequent departure of his 2003 teammate Martin Johnson as manager following a series of controversies among the squad and the ruling body. ""To do so fills me with great sadness, but I know that I have been blessed in so many ways to have experienced what I have with the England rugby team,"" Wilkinson said on his website on Monday. ""To say I have played through four World Cups, two Lions tours, 91 international games and a ridiculous number of injuries and other setbacks gives me an incredibly special feeling of fulfillment. But by now I know myself well enough to know that I will never truly be satisfied."" A perfectionist in his approach on and off the pitch, perhaps best illustrated by his painstaking goalkicking style, Wilkinson was twice rugby's record points scorer before the mantle was retaken by New Zealand's Dan Carter this year. He totaled 1,246 in all internationals for England and the British & Irish Lions, and has a record 277 scored at World Cups -- helping beat Australia 20-17 in extra-time eight years ago, then losing to South Africa in the 2007 final. Wilkinson started his career at Newcastle in 1997, but joined Toulon in 2009 and will continue his career with the French club. Stuart Lancaster, who has taken over as England's interim head coach, said Wilkinson was one of the nation's greatest players. ""He will of course be remembered for that drop-goal but he is more than that, a model sportsman -- down to earth and hard working, who has never stopped trying to be the best that he can,"" said England's head of elite player development. ""Everyone who has played with, coached and watched Jonny play should feel privileged to have had an involvement with him. Not only has he been a world-class player but he has inspired thousands to play and watch the game of rugby. ""He will continue to do great things with Toulon and I would like to go and see him in France to learn from his vast knowledge and experience of 13 years at the very top of the international game.""","England flyhalf Johnny Wilkinson ends his international career at age of 32 .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Two policemen were killed by a suicide car bomber in Russia's North Caucasus republic of Dagestan, the Dagestani Interior Ministry said on its website Monday. The ministry said the officers were patrolling the town of Kizilyurt in a minivan around midnight when an unidentified bomber sitting in a parked Lada car set off an unidentified explosive device in his car as the police minivan was passing by. The explosion left a crater 1.5 meters (5 feet) wide and 15 centimeters (6 inches) deep, the ministry said. The police minivan was burned out, the ministry said. Dagestan has been hit by a series of deadly attacks recently, including fatal bombings and shootings. It is the largest and most volatile of the five Northern Caucasus regions. Rebels continue to stage frequent attacks on security forces, police and civilians. In August, the head of the Federal Security Service Alexandr Bortnikov told the Russian president that in the first six months of this year, 169 terrorist acts were committed, of which 110 took place in Dagestan. In recent years, Dagestan has faced ethnic friction, spillover from the discord in neighboring Chechnya and attacks on government officials by militant Islamists, the International Crisis Group has said.","The officers were on patrol when a car bomber detonated a device .

"Second Life allows people to lead two lives -- one in the real world and another in the virtual. But in a way, Second Life itself leads two lives. In just fours years of existence, Second Life has moved far beyond people simulating other lives on the Internet. In its first, well-publicized life, it's a forum for residents to socialize, shop and even have sex via on-screen avatars. In its second life, it's a flexible platform for running inexpensive simulations and experiments. The latter might prove to be the most important. ""Second Life's real potential may be that of an experimentation platform,"" says Eric Klopfer, a professor at MIT. He notes the ability within Second Life to rapidly construct objects and experiences ""without having to build the world from scratch."" Indeed, it's relatively easy for residents to build objects that others can use, sit on, walk through, pick up and so on. That can mean anything from a hammer to a house to a landscape. And since it's also easy to share, replicate and tweak creations, Second Life is a world of abundance for creators. That makes it an effective testing platform for trying out concepts quickly and cheaply. David E. Stone, an MIT research fellow, reports creating simulations in three days -- for $350 -- that others proposed building in six months for $60,000. That's caught the attention of the corporate world. Many companies see potential savings, for instance, in moving parts of their new-employee training programs to a virtual world. Stone has been hired by a range of companies -- from a pest extermination firm to a power plant operator -- to create prototypes of such systems in Second Life. Security concerns . Testing a concept in Second Life doesn't have to mean hosting the final product there. Security might be a concern, for instance. ""By definition, social networking is open,"" notes Paul Terlemezian, president of iFive Alliances, a corporate-training consultancy in Atlanta. ""That's kind of contrary to corporate training, which is closed and proprietary."" A company, then, might try to find a more secure virtual environment, or perhaps add security elements within Second Life. Of course, most of the experimenting done in Second Life is far more light-hearted. But it's still often easy to envision commercial or educational applications. In one YouTube clip a man is seen exercising on a treadmill in front of a large plasma screen that displays scenes from Second Life. Using the wireless controller from Nintendo's Wii console, he appears to indicate which scenery he would like to jog ""through"" on the screen. If that's a workable concept, the fitness equipment industry might like to know about it. Other Second Life experiments aim to make experimentation itself easier -- especially important for those with little programming knowledge. This suggests that the level of creativity will only increase. Many residents who have learned how to create objects -- like a house -- still lack the scripting skills to add behavior to those objects. So Eric Rosenbaum, a grad student at MIT's Media Lab, is building a user-friendly programming tool for easily adding behaviors. When the tool is available, turning a static dance floor into an interactive one that shakes when stepped on could simply require dragging a ""Shake"" module over it. How a capability like that might be used is anyone's guess, including Rosenbaum's, he admits. But, he adds, ""We could see a blossoming of new content created by people who don't have any background in programming, but who can imagine and create new kinds of experiences in Second Life."" Tapping users' creativity . Of course, back in 2003 when Second Life was launched as a largely user-generated virtual world, how it would be used was anyone's guess. But the whole idea was to tap the creativity of the residents themselves. ""I'm not surprised by the amount of experimentation in Second Life,"" says Philip Rosedale, founder and CEO of Linden Research, the company behind the virtual world. ""I always expected to see resident innovation and creativity."" Yet this aspect of Second Life has been overshadowed of late. Residents who socialize primarily in the virtual world have been chided to ""get a first life."" Madison Avenue has been lampooned for spending large sums on branded virtual islands that nobody hangs out on. But aside from these cycles of hype and anti-hype, the original goal of uninhibited mass experimentation proceeds apace. Just as the company gave up some control to encourage creativity, some creations in Second Life operate freely on their own. Resident-created Svarga Island, for instance, boasts an interdependent ecosystem within Second Life that acts according to the rules of ""nature,"" with tropical plants needing the insects and everything needing the physics-driven rain clouds. Every element acts according to rules, but within that framework there is much randomness -- just like with nature. It's easy to see the educational possibilities. Some experiments involve bringing things out of Second Life and into the real world. Residents are now looking to three-dimensional printers, among other methods, for turning their virtual objects into real ones. ""The possibilities on Second Life are endless,"" says Janet Travers, who designs virtual ball gowns she hopes to bring to the real world. ""We are only limited by our imaginations."" Other experiments within Second Life are kept out of general view. Stone tells of a surreal encounter he had with a software programmer's avatar about six months ago. On a dark night in the virtual world, he says, ""we walked off the edge of his land to a spot deep beneath the ocean and into an underwater cave. He then showed me some achievements in software engineering that were well beyond what I then thought was possible in any environment, real or virtual."" Whether Second Life continues as a popular place to hold such experimentation remains to be seen. Rosenbaum was attracted by its ""large existing user base"" and ""creative culture."" Other platforms, though, have drawn attention for their own merits. Croquet, for instance, trumpets being open-source and decentralized. As a proof of concept, though, Second Life has already been an interesting experiment. E-mail to a friend .","Second Life's real value may be to test ideas, analysts say .

"(CNN) -- Eight former executives and agents of Siemens AG and its subsidiaries have been indicted in a bribery scheme alleging that they paid or promised Argentine officials $100 million to land a contract worth 10 times as much, the U.S. Justice Department said Tuesday. They are charged with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, wire fraud and money laundering. None of the defendants named in the indictment is in the United States. Justice officials said those involved in the decade-long scheme are from Germany, Switzerland, Argentina and other countries. According to the indictment, the Siemens executives paid millions in bribes in 1994 to secure a bid to create a national identity card system in Argentina. After the project faced suspension in 1999, the defendants are accused of promising even more bribes to the next presidential administration to keep the project afloat. To top it off, once the project met its demise in 2001, Siemens filed an arbitration claim against Argentina claiming wrongful termination of the contract and seeking $500 million in lost profits. The company hid from the proceedings that it had illegally acquired the contract in the first place, the indictment said. Justice Department officials praised Siemen's cooperation and said the company that has 60,000 employees in the United States played a large and cooperative role in exposing the alleged conspiracy. The eight indicted men include Uriel Sharef, former member of the central executive committee of Siemens AG; Herbert Steffen, former CEO of Siemens Argentina; and Andres Truppel, former CFO of Siemens Argentina. Also named in the indictment are Ulrich Bock, Stephan Signer and Eberhard Reichert, former senior executives of Siemens Business Services; and Carlos Sergi and Miguel Czysch, who were agents of Siemens in the alleged bribe scheme. ""There were few lines these executives were not willing to cross,"" said Robert Khuzami, director of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission. Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer said, ""Today's indictment alleges a shocking level of deception and corruption."" In short, the company committed to pay more than $100 million in bribes to win the $1 billion contract, Breuer said. About $60 million was allegedly paid, he said. ""Business should be won or lost on the merits of a company's products and services, not the amount of bribes paid to government officials,"" Breuer said. Ronald Hosko, special agent in charge of the FBI in Washington, said corruption is among the FBI's highest investigative priorities, adding, ""Foreign bribery is not an acceptable business practice. Backroom deals and corrupt payments to foreign officials to obtain business wear away public confidence in our global marketplace."" If convicted, the defendants could each be sentenced to 20 years in prison and face fines, officials said. CNN's Jim Barnett contributed to this report.","Former Siemens officials are accused of paying more than $100 million in bribes .

"(CNN) -- The rivalry is so intense that Barnes & Noble actually spoke its competitor's name: . ""Kindle Fire is deficient for a media tablet,"" Barnes & Noble CEO William Lynch said as he unveiled his company's Nook Tablet on Monday. ""Content will render better on Nook than on Kindle Fire."" That jab essentially re-opened the fight between Barnes & Noble and Amazon over customers looking for digital-book-reading devices. Round I in this donnybrook was between the Nook and Kindle e-readers. Next week, however, both companies will put their next-generation tablets on the market, setting up a new battle for holiday shoppers looking for gadgets that are good for reading books, watching videos and browsing the Internet. Here's a quick comparison of the devices, which are called the Nook Tablet and Kindle Fire. (The gist, in case you're in a hurry, is that they're pretty darn similar; the Kindle costs $50 less, while the Nook has twice the storage space and a longer advertised battery life). Price . Nook Tablet: $249 . Kindle Fire: $199 . Sale date . Nook Tablet: November 17 . Kindle Fire: November 15 . Screens . Both: 7-inch touch-sensitive screen with color display . Purpose . Both: Reading books, watching videos and browsing the Web. Both of these devices are more focused on the book-reading experience than the Apple iPad, which dominates the tablet field. Operating system . Both: Customized versions of Google Android . Apps . You'd think these Android-based tablets would give owners access to the popular Google Android Market, which houses more than 250,000 apps. But no.

"Miami (CNN) -- The 4-year-old girl sobbed as rescuers rushed her ashore. In the boat behind her, the faces of her fellow survivors were painted with ""a thousand-yard stare,"" one witness said Monday. That girl and three others spent 20 hours stranded in stormy water after their 22-foot boat capsized off the Florida Keys over the weekend. They were picked up Sunday afternoon by Coast Guard rescuers. A few hours earlier, David Jensen was maneuvering the Snap Shot, his fishing charter boat, from Duck Key to the open sea when he and others ""saw a big object floating in the distance."" ""The closer I got, I could see a guy waving,"" Jensen said. They found three men clinging to part of what had been their boat. One charter customer quickly jumped in to help, while others threw life jackets to the men, only one of which could muster the energy to swim over, Jensen said. Once aboard, a language barrier -- the rescued men were Spanish-speaking -- and raw emotions made it difficult to ascertain exactly what had happened. One who did speak English was very upset: ""He lost his mother,"" Jensen explained. Officer Robert Dube of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said Monday that a son had tried to hold onto his 79-year-old mother in the hours after their ship went down around noon Saturday. But she slipped away into the rough waters, Dube said, before rescuers could reach her. This victim, later identified as Zaida San Jurjo Gonzalez, and the men had clung to the capsized boat's hull. But four others -- three women and the young girl -- couldn't hold on, and drifted off, Jensen said, based on his conversations with the survivors and authorities. The charter boat captain contacted the Coast Guard after learning others were unaccounted for, and he took his boat out five miles in the direction where the four had drifted away. He saw no signs of them. But rescuers did come upon the four Sunday morning, bringing them aboard near Marathon, which is roughly halfway between Key Largo and Key West, according to a Coast Guard statement . Authorities later learned that the three women, wearing life jackets, had held tight to a floating cooler and took turns holding the girl through the afternoon, night and next morning. ""That definitely saved their lives,"" Dube told CNN. ""It could have been a lot worse situation."" Wayne Crosby of Captain Hook's Marina and Dive Center said he watched rescuers bring the four to a dock in Marathon on Sunday. They handed the girl off the boat first, he told CNN affiliate WSVN. ""They had her all wrapped up. ... She couldn't stop crying. She was panic-stricken,"" Crosby said. At the dock, rescuers scrambled to tend to all the victims. ""They just had that look on their face, like a thousand-yard stare,"" Crosby told WSVN. The group had suffered multiple jellyfish stings over the course of their ordeal, Dube said. And by Monday, the 4-year-old had been treated for mild hypothermia and exhaustion. But the wildlife officer added that, by then, she appeared to be ""in very good spirits."" Ernie Perroncello, owner and operator of Sea Tow in Marathon, said weather in the area Saturday when the boat went down was terrible. ""You can get yourself in trouble real quick "" on the area's water, said Perroncello, whose company salvaged the capsized boat.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Two airmen on a U.S. Air Force F-15 Eagle died when the plane crashed in eastern Afghanistan early Saturday, the U.S. military said. A U.S. Air Force F-15 Eagle similar to this one crashed Saturday in eastern Afghanistan. The two-man fighter went down while it was conducting military operations, another source, Lt. Col. Reid Christopherson, said earlier. ""At this time, we are very comfortable in stating there was no hostile fire in the incident,"" Christopherson said. He added that a board of officers will investigate the crash of the highly maneuverable, all-weather tactical fighter. In a news release, the military said the incident occurred at 3:15 a.m. Kabul time and also noted that there was no ""hostile fire."" ""We mourn the loss of these two airmen and our thoughts are with their families, loved ones and their unit,"" the news release said. ""Only after a deliberative and thorough investigation will we know what caused this event. "" A spokesman for the governor of Afghanistan's central Ghazni province, who goes by the single name Jihangir, confirmed that a U.S. plane crashed in Ghazni's Nawur district before dawn. ""The crash site was sealed off by coalition forces,"" Jihangir told CNN by telephone, ""Afghan police were not allowed to have access to this area."" The Afghan official said the plane crashed in Ghazni, some 160 kilometers west of the town of Ghazni, between the communities of Qaracha and Bahari. The jet crash comes in a bloody month in Afghanistan. July's toll of international military fatalities stands at 50, the highest tally so far, a CNN count of official statistics shows.

"(CNN) -- As the dust settled after the latest agreement was struck to solve the Eurozone debt crisis, French President Nicolas Sarkozy admitted it had been a ""mistake"" to admit the stricken Greeks into the monetary union. ""Let's be clear; it was a mistake,"" Sarkozy told French television. ""Greece came into the Euro with numbers that were false and its economy was not prepared to assume an integration into the Eurozone. It was a decision that was taken in, I believe, 2001, for which we now are paying the consequence."" Wednesday's agreement, reached in Brussels, will slash Greek debt, recapitalize European banks and more than double the European Union bailout fund's resources to handle future sovereign defaults. ""It's great news that we've got an agreement,"" said Deutsche Bank economist Gilles Moec. ""When Europe puts its heads together, they do actually begin to cooperate."" However speculation is rife about China's role in the success of the plan, with suggestions they will provide capital to bolster the euro -- a scenario Sarkozy has no qualms about. ""If the Chinese, who have 60% of global reserves, decide to invest in the euro instead of the dollar, why refuse?"" he asked. China has welcomed the EU Summit consensus, whose main elements include a 50% reduction in the value of Greek government bonds, steps recapitalize European banks and plans to attract capital for the already overburdened European Financial Stability Facility rescue fund, in order to reduce Greek debt from the current astronomical 160% of its current economy to 120% of total economic output over the next 10 years. China indicated that it may be in its best interest to contribute to a solution, although made no mention of specific plans to do so. ""We believe that, as the largest economy in the world, the steady, sound, and healthy growth of the EU economy and the Eurozone is vital to the world economy's recovery,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said at a regular press briefing on Thursday. ""We are also ready to work with the EU to overcome the difficulty."" But Chinese support would depend on Europe's ability to guarantee the safety of any investment, Li Daokui, a member of China's Central Bank Monetary Policy Committee, told the Financial Times. ""It is in China's long-term and intrinsic interest to help Europe because they are our biggest trading partner but the chief concern of the Chinese government is how to explain this decision to our own people,"" Li said. Li added that China could use fiscal support as leverage to deter Europe from criticizing China's currency policy, which is often criticized for being undervalued and unfairly benefiting Chinese exports. Europe hopes to attract capital from sovereign wealth funds, particularly from developing nations like China and Russia, to supplement the â‚¬440 billion rescue fund, but analysts note that the structure of these investments remains unknown. In a phone conversation with Sarkozy on Thursday, Chinese President Hu Jintao made no mention of specific plans to invest in the scheme, but lauded Europe's progress in solving the debt crisis. The leaders discussed plans for the upcoming G20 Summit, with Hu saying the annual meeting had become a platform for cleaning up the global economy and that he hopes it can continue to adhere to the spirit of cooperation and common success, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported. ""It is not in China's interest to fund this scheme,"" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics told CNN Money. ""It is better advised to sit this out and buy assets at liquidation than to invest in a sinking ship."" Meanwhile the EU's bailout fund chief Klaus Regling will meet with officials in Beijing and Tokyo Friday, though no reason has been given for his visit.","""Let's be clear; it was a mistake,"" Sarkozy, on the Euro for Greece .

"(CNN) -- His golf career might be in a seemingly downward spiral, but Tiger Woods is still the world's most valuable sportsman according to a top business magazine. The American, who this week dropped out of the world's top 50 golfers for the first time in 15 years, has retained his position as Forbes' top individual sports brand. The 36-year-old has, according to Forbes' calculations, lost $17 million from his brand worth in the past year. But his $55 million value is still $29 million higher than the second-placed athlete, tennis star Roger Federer. Despite the scandal that broke in late 2009 about the marital infidelities that led to his divorce from wife Elin Nordegren, Woods has begun to restore his portfolio of endorsements with June's agreement with Japan's Kowa Company, which deals in medical equipment and pharmaceuticals. Fellow golfer Phil Mickelson is ranked third with $24 million, while basketball star LeBron James is catching fast with $20 million. The Miami Heat player earned half that total from his deal with Nike -- again Forbes' most valuable overall brand, up 40% to $15 billion after spreading its swoosh into even more world markets. English football club Manchester United lost top spot in the team brands to baseball's New York Yankees. While United suffered due to the British pound weakening against the dollar, with a worth of $269 million, the Yankees' value -- now $340 million -- has boomed 57% since 2007 according to Forbes' Mike Ozanian. ""Had the exchange rate held fast since 2007 the Red Devils, who are looking to capitalize on their global fan base with an IPO (public share offering), would still be the most valuable team brand,"" Ozanian said. The NFL's showpiece Super Bowl, with a brand value of $425 million, stayed well clear of the Summer Olympics ($230 million) and the FIFA World Cup ($147 million).","Tiger Woods tops Forbes' most valuable brand list despite his form slump .

"(CNN) -- Arriving in central Bangkok from the sparkling international airport, a visitor might not know at first glance that much of the city is under water. Shops and restaurants are open as usual, while the futuristic sky train continues to ferry commuters to work in the numerous office complexes that make up the central business district. But just a few miles northwards along the Vibhavadi Rangsit highway, the road gradually disappears into a sea of filthy brown water -- floodwater from the north of Thailand that shows little sign of disappearing quickly. This is due in large part to a system of floodgates set up to protect the commercial center of the city and other key industrial areas by diverting the run-off to these parts. For almost a month, residents in outlying areas such as Rangsit and Lumlukka have been living in water that is often chest-high. Many defied government evacuation orders to protect their property, even if it meant being stranded with limited food and no clean running water. Read predictions that flooding would remain for weeks . Romeo Romei, a local businessman, lost his house and is battling to save his factory, but he still manages to take a boat out each day with his friend Alex Stamp and cousin Duccio Lucchesi to distribute water, food and clothes to those in need. From his factory office in Rangsit, supplies donated by friends and family are sorted into rescue packs for men, women and children, while the factory workers man an array of water pumps -- some of them cannibalized swimming pool pumps -- around the clock, praying that the defensive wall they erected around the warehouse doesn't collapse. They are literally under siege from the water. Yet Romeo is concerned about the 10 families around the corner who have been forced to set up camp on the upper floors of a dilapidated industrial building nearby. Watch Romeo visiting families in a Rangsit warehouse . Riding in the fully-laden dinghy across what was once the factory's car park, he explains what spurred him into action. ""For the first few days after the floods we went about our business dealing with the factory. But soon we couldn't bear to see people suffering."" He says the government is not helping these people, while aid agencies are nowhere to be seen around these flood-hit streets. ""I saw one boat with around 10 packs of food, but there are thousands of people here,"" he said. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra laid out a three-point recovery plan, including immediate aid to those whose homes and businesses have been destroyed. Meanwhile, relief workers have been distributing aid to evacuation centers but face difficulties reaching residents who have decided to wait out the crisis in their homes. As we unload the supplies of eggs, fruit, rice and medicine at our destination, the conditions the families are living in is humbling. On the ground floor, children play in the same stagnant water that dogs defecate in, while the adults gather in their damp makeshift sleeping areas with what little they could salvage from their homes. However, the atmosphere is not depressing, especially since a year-old baby has taken his first steps in this unlikely setting. Romeo points out that Thais never complain and always have a smile on their faces. He contends this is because there is no expectation that anyone will be there to help them. Watch Romeo and friends boat down a road in Rangsit . As the boat pushes off to find more people to help, we're immediately surrounded by people. Some are asking if we have water, while others are looking for diapers. No one seems greedy or aggressive. They paddle around in anything that will float, from polystyrene blocks to an old refrigerator, while small children swim about in ""life jackets"" made from empty plastic bottles strung together and stuffed into pieces of clothing. This, Alex says, is evidence of the Thai ability to improvise and adapt in adversity. Impact Your World: See how you can help . An internet security consultant, Alex frequently has to field calls from clients on the boat. He says he even dropped his iPhone into the water during one call and could not find it for five minutes. He eventually fished it out, and it continues to work. After passing a partially submerged McDonalds drive-thru and a golf course which now resembles a Florida-style swamp, we spend time feeding countless abandoned dogs and cats -- a reminder of how quickly some people were forced to leave their homes. Romeo points out that one dog had been tied to the same railing for over a week. The obvious buildup of garbage, both in and around the water, has raised fears about the spread of disease. According to the country's Ministry of Public Heath, some 20,700 kits have been distributed that test for leptospirosis, a severe bacterial infection that can affect areas where water has been stagnant for more than three weeks. Romeo says he made sure his workers have had tetanus shots. While most businesses around Rangsit and Lumlukka -- including the domestic Don Muang airport -- have been forced to close, the local hospital has remained open for emergency cases only -- provided patients can negotiate the improvised jetty and barking dogs at what was the emergency room entrance. The ER has been completely destroyed, but a functioning triage unit has been set up on the first floor among piles of dental chairs rescued from another flooded wing. The staff -- doctors, nurses and administrators -- have all been living in the hospital since the crisis began. ""We are coping,"" says the friendly receptionist without a hint of dissent. Back on the highway-turned-river, the boat makes several stops to help people struggling to paddle or wade their way through chest-high water -- including a woman pushing a five-month baby in a kitchen basin, as she searched for diapers -- before we reach the house of Romeo's father on an affluent street. The street signs are almost all under water here, indicating a depth of at least two meters. We take our own measurement: 2.20 meters. When we reach the house, dark green tide marks on the outer walls illustrate how the water had recently neared 2.5 meters. The ground floor is a disaster, as pieces of furniture float freely around what was the lounge. ""I'm still smiling,"" Romeo's father says through gritted teeth. His son can barely recognize the house he grew up in. The smell of stagnant water is also overpowering, while mold is starting to appear on the upper floors, thanks to the ""cooking"" of the water below in mid-afternoon heat. There's no electricity to power a fan or air-conditioning unit. Two blocks away, Romeo's own house has not fared any better. A car roof can just be seen in the drive. Romeo's father, who moved from Italy to Thailand more than 30 years ago, thinks it will be months before the water will be gone. ""But where will the water go?"" he asks. ""I can't see central Bangkok avoiding this."" By now it's almost pitch-black, with almost no street lamps working. The water is so congested with other boats -- some carrying cars -- that it takes us an hour to reach dry land. The changing depth is also a major hazard, as the propeller on the boat occasionally smashes against concrete. Another hour-long journey in a car this time, and I'm back in central Bangkok. Commuters are heading home, and bars and restaurants are open. It's a different city.","Floodwaters from north Thailand show little sign of disappearing quickly .

"(CNN) -- For a good part of her career, Martina McBride's success has largely been due to relying on Nashville songwriters and approaching arrangements in a pop-country fashion. While hits like ""Wild Angels,"" ""A Broken Wing"" and ""Wrong Again"" solidified her position as country radio royalty, McBride's shaking things up these days. She's ditched both of those early crutches and now is exploring writing on her own and injecting a more roots-oriented sound into her instrumentation. Such is the case with ""Eleven,"" McBride's 11th studio album, which drops today. These days, she's working with new management, has a new label in Republic Nashville and wrote six of the 11 songs that appear on her latest project . As the 45-year-old singer soldiers on, what about this moment inspired change, and how's her own songwriting coming along? CNN spoke with McBride recently as she was prepping for a concert in Minot, North Dakota. CNN: ""Eleven"" comes with a lot of professional changes. Why is this? Martina McBride: You know, sometimes it's just time to shake things up a little bit. When you've been at a certain place and management for 18 years, I just felt like I really need someone around me with some fresh ideas, some new passion and energy. CNN: As female country musicians age these days, are there pressures to stay youthful? How does one age gracefully in Nashville? McBride: Oh, I think the same way you age gracefully anywhere else. Females have always had more of a focus on the way they look. No matter what business your in, if you're in the public eye -- whether you're an actor or a rock musician or even head of a corporation, it's always been that way. You just try ... I don't know, I try not to focus on it. I'm still the same voice I had before, and I still have a lot to say. CNN: ""Eleven"" was largely written by you -- something you've taken on recently. What's your writing process like? McBride: It's different every time. Sometimes I'll have an idea or a title. ... I'm still growing as a writer. One thing I think I bring to the table is having a certain type of lyric, in that I want the song to feel honest and real. I don't do it 365 days a year, so I'm fresh. I also don't know a lot of the rules, which is probably a good thing. For me, it's still about discovery. I'm still in the stage of writing that I'm discovering, getting confidence as a writer and that I do have some talent for it. It's a good discovery at this stage of the game. CNN: And sometimes songwriters who start out at 20, by 30 they feel like they're all tapped out. McBride: I grew up admiring Linda Ronstadt, Pat Benatar, Reba (McEntire). I didn't really grow up enamored only with singer-songwriters. When I moved to Nashville, it wasn't a big deal for me just to find songs by great writers and make them my own. But what I really found with this record was that it's so nice to not have to wait for someone to write something. Obviously, I love every record I've made, but I feel like this record is more authentic to me. I don't know. It's different than just singing a song after it's already been written. I'm excited about that. CNN: On ""Eleven"" the first single's called ""Teenage Daughters,"" which is about the trouble they can cause. Did you give your parents any heart attacks growing up? McBride: Oh, oh, yeah. So far, my daughter is much better than me. I grew up on a farm in really rural Kansas, where there was nothing to do. Out of boredom, the activities we found to do, weren't exactly the best for my parents to go through. But I think the song's about -- the teenage experience and wanting that independence and rebelling against the rule is so common, no matter where you are in the world. CNN: It seems harder these days to be a teenager. McBride: It's different. They have a lot of peer pressure. We all did, but they have a cavalier attitude about things. They don't have the same caution about certain things and are more like ""whatever, it's not that big a deal."" CNN: You were associated with the pop-country movement of the '90s, but listening to ""Eleven"" and looking at your recent output, it doesn't seem like you're interested in that anymore. McBride: It's interesting that you say that. I don't know if I ever stood out to make a particular type of record. Before, I was so dependent on the songs I found and the songs that came in. I was drawn to certain types of songs but I didn't have the luxury of waiting around for years and years. I had a vision of ""Eleven"" being more organic, more retro, like a '70s rock record. It is less pop. CNN: On the Grammys, you performed a tribute to Aretha Franklin with Christina Aguilera, Florence Welch, Jennifer Hudson and Yolanda Adams. Are there aspects of pop and rock these days you find intriguing? McBride: I love Train's new record. And I love One Republic's record. My daughter's really into the Avett Brothers and Mumford & Sons, so I've been listening to them recently. That's a whole new type of thing; I don't know what you'd call that.","Martina McBride drops her 11th album today .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Brooke Mueller has reconsidered her decision to undergo at-home drug rehab. Instead, Charlie Sheen's ex-wife has checked into an in-patient treatment center, her spokesman said Tuesday. Mueller was arrested in Aspen, Colorado, on December 3 and charged with assault and cocaine possession, police said. Mueller's publicist told CNN Monday that she would ""take a different approach to deal with her addiction"" with a daytime rehab program and around-the-clock supervision at home. ""After further reflection and consideration, Brooke has decided to remove herself from the media spotlight and has entered a long-term in-patient treatment center where she can focus on her recovery without distraction,"" spokesman Steve Honig said Tuesday. Mueller, 34, checked into the rehab facility before the announcement was made, he said. ""Brooke's goal is to maintain her sobriety and she believes this is the best option to reach that goal,"" Honig said. The 2-year-old twin sons she shares with Sheen ""will remain in their home and familiar surroundings and be under the care of their longtime nanny,"" he said. ""Charlie and Brooke's parents fully support her decision and everyone recognizes the importance of maintaining the children's normal routine,"" he said. The incidents in Aspen began when a woman at the Belly Up -- a bar and performance venue there -- complained that Mueller had been ""the aggressor"" in an assault, Aspen police said. Mueller was found and arrested after midnight at another bar, Escobar, police said. She was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, which is a felony, and third-degree assault, which is a misdemeanor. She was released after posting an $11,000 bond, Aspen police said. A court date is scheduled for Monday. Mueller has appeared as an actress in several movies, including 2004's ""A Love Song for Bobby Long,"" according to IMDb. But she is more widely known as the ex-wife of Sheen. The twin sons and Mueller were part of Sheen's volatile public fall-out with CBS earlier this year as he left his starring role on the network's ""Two and Half Men."" She claimed in March that he'd threatened to kill her, saying, ""I will cut your head off, put it in a box and send it to your mom,"" according to a declaration made in a restraining order against Sheen. The revelations led to a court order removing the 2-year-old boys from Sheen's home. The actor called the allegation ""colorful"" and described the quote attributed to him as fabricated in an interview with NBC's ""Today Show."" Mueller has sought help for substance abuse and stress-related issues in the past. Last December, her attorney, Yale Galanter, said that she entered a sober living facility. Earlier, in April 2010, Mueller had checked into a treatment facility for help with stress management to prevent a ""return to old problems,"" her representative said. She was in substance abuse rehab earlier in 2010 ""to get her health in order,"" Galanter said at the time. The couple was involved in an alleged domestic dispute in Aspen on Christmas Day 2009 that resulted in felony charges against Sheen. CNN's Jack Hannah contributed to this report.","Mueller can ""focus on her recovery without distraction"" in rehab, a spokesman says .

"(Health.com) -- Women run a lower risk of having babies with certain birth defects if they eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains during their childbearing years, a new study suggests. Women who followed healthy Mediterranean-style diets in the year before pregnancy were up to one-half as likely as those who ate diets high in meat, fat, and sugar to have a baby with anencephaly, a neural-tube defect that blocks the development of the brain and tends to result in miscarriage. Compared with fat- and sugar-heavy diets, healthier diets -- which included plenty of folate, iron, and calcium -- were also associated with up to a one-third lower risk of cleft lip, a one-quarter lower risk of cleft palate, and a one-fifth lower risk of spina bifida, another neural-tube defect. ""Diet quality matters, and it was protective,"" says Suzan L. Carmichael, Ph.D., the lead author of the study and an associate professor of pediatrics at the Stanford School of Medicine, in Palo Alto, California. Health.com: Feed the Belly: Recipes for a healthy pregnancy . The defects covered in the study are very rare overall, occurring in less than 0.1% of all births. They have become less common since the 1990s, when government health officials led a campaign to increase folic-acid intake among pregnant women through supplements and fortified grain products. Deficiencies in folic acid -- the synthetic form of folate, a B vitamin -- have been linked to both neural-tube defects and cleft lip and palate. Carmichael and her colleagues took into account whether the women in the study were taking folic acid, which suggests that a healthy diet provides protection against birth defects over and above that provided by folic acid. Women of childbearing age should, however, still take folic-acid supplements, says Gail Harrison, Ph.D., a professor of community health services at the UCLA School of Public Health, in Los Angeles. ""Folic acid has made a difference,"" says Harrison, who was not involved in the study. ""In countries that have used fortification levels higher than the U.S., it has made an even bigger impact."" Health.com: How to soothe heartburn during pregnancy . Most research on diet and birth defects has focused on single nutrients, such as vitamins A and B12 (in addition to folate). Carmichael and her colleagues took a different approach by looking at overall diet quality -- a method that has become common in cancer and heart-disease research. The government-funded study, which appears this week in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, compared the diets of 3,824 mothers whose children experienced birth defects with those of 6,807 mothers of healthy children. The researchers collected detailed questionnaires about the women's diets in the year before they became pregnant, and used that data to score their diet quality on two indexes, one modeled on the U.S. Department of Agriculture dietary guidelines and another based on the Mediterranean diet. Both indexes considered fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and ""good"" fats to be healthy, and saturated fats and sweets to be unhealthy. Health.com: Good fats, bad fats: how to choose . Across the board, women with the healthiest diets were far less likely to have had children with birth defects than the women with the poorest-quality diets. High scores on both indexes were associated with a reduced risk of defects, although the association was stronger for the USDA score. Seventy-eight percent of the women took supplements containing folic acid during early pregnancy, but higher-quality diets were protective regardless of whether the women took folic acid.

"(CNN) -- As the powerhouses of the rugby world continue to battle over the Web Ellis trophy in the knockout stages of the World Cup, some of the sport's less-fancied teams are making their way home after a valiant, if unsuccessful, fight in the group stages. Since the tournament began in 1987, only four nations have walked away as world champions: New Zealand, South Africa, Australia and England. Canada's Canucks, Georgia's Lelos or the U.S. Eagles were never the bookmakers' favorites to win the Cup and for obvious reasons. These emerging nations do not compete anywhere near as regularly as the elite sides and, along with tactical and experience deficiencies, face a daunting challenge to emerge from the bruising challenge of the pool matches in the world's most prestigious event. But these teams do have heart and motivation and -- perhaps most of all -- they have the joy and passion of national pride. Whether or not they walk away with wins, it's being there, representing their nations and improving the standard of rugby within their countries, that matters most for them. ""When that flag is waving and the anthem plays before the game, if that doesn't get you going, you need to see a cardiologist,"" former Eagles player and coach Jack Clark told CNN. ""It's just one of those moments where you feel not only a lot of responsibility, but you feel really privileged to have that responsibility."" Lelos making strides . Georgia did not make an appearance in the Rugby World Cup until 2003, but the they became an overnight sensation during that year's tournament with their passionate play, despite not actually winning a match. The Lelos, named after an indigenous Georgian sport similar to rugby, also qualified for the 2007 finals and nearly caused a sensation by coming within a whisker of beating established nation Ireland. Just 11 days later, they beat Namibia 30-0 to record their first World Cup success. For a nation that considers rugby to be a minority sport, Georgia are supported by an intensely loyal fan base and host a number of players who regularly compete in France, adding to their level of conditioning. ""The strength of our team is in our physicality,"" media manager Lasha Khurtsidze told CNN. ""We always have very good forwards and our scrum is considered to be in the top five in the world. Our players have a very strong sense of pride and courage. They play like they are on a battlefield protecting their country."" Georgia qualified for this year's tournament after defeating Russia 36-8 and winning the European Nations Cup in 2010. ""We are determined to show the world that we are not underdogs,"" Khurtsidze added. ""We want to prove that we deserve a place among the elite teams. We aim more at playing with dignity rather than winning, however, to win one or two matches is very important because expectations are very high here in Georgia."" In this year's tournament, Georgia narrowly lost to Scotland, England and Argentina, but beat Romania 25-7. ""I think Georgia surpassed expectations in this year's World Cup,"" Alex Payne, a Sky Sports broadcaster who regularly covers rugby, told CNN. ""I would have expected them to have lost more heavily to Scotland, England and Argentina, given those teams would have been very aware of what Georgia are capable of. Georgia were not taken lightly by any of those teams, and yet still, the margins of victory were more than respectable for a side that doesn't get that much competitive play. ""Georgia have come a long way in a short state of time,"" Payne added. ""If they can add a bit more creativity and flair behind what they've got up front, then they will push forward."" Eye on the Eagles . The U.S. Eagles have participated in each World Cup since 1987 (except 1995, when they did not qualify), but going into this year's Cup, they had only ever won only two matches, both against Japan. Although they are a national team, the Eagles are not considered part of the professional game. The U.S. players were exposed to rugby in high school or college and many are former American football players. ""These are regular people with normal jobs who have learned to challenge themselves outside the usual lifestyle,"" Julie McCoy, coach of the USA sevens side, told CNN. ""The majority of those players have come through the high school and college All-American system over the last 10 years. They finally have a pathway. It's not just a bunch of guys saying 'Hey, who wants to go represent the U.S. in the World Cup?' That was the mechanism 10 years ago."" While other countries were holding training camps in July, the Eagles were unable to practice as a team, according to head coach Eddie O'Sullivan. When the players do get together, they have to make up for lost time in addition to preparing for a global tournament. ""It's a pretty meager existence, but we make those sacrifices so we can get our proper training and conditioning in,"" Eagles center Paul Emerick told CNN. ""It's a testament to the guys who are dedicated. Everyone wants to be here and put their time in."" The main core of the current U.S. squad played together in the 2007 tournament, and the players have managed to maintain a tight chemistry. That, combined with the pride they take in representing their country on a world stage, provides Team USA with its greatest strengths. ""The ultimate thing you want to do is represent your country,"" Eagles lock Scot LaValla told CNN. ""That's the dream, the goal, the end result if you're really committed to your sport. One of the things I'm constantly impressed with is the chemistry on the team. Physically you have a team here who is strong as any other team, but our commitment to each other is an asset."" The Eagles fell to Ireland and Italy , and were thrashed 67-5 by Australia. However, they achieved an important goal by defeating Russia 13-6, a result that saw them finish fourth in Pool C, ahead of the Russians. ""I would expect that they wanted to beat Russia by more,"" Payne said. ""The disappointing thing for them will be the hammering at the hands of Australia. That is the kind of gap they will want to close in the future. They will be disappointed not to have made more of a statement at the Cup, but they showed that they've got some really talented players."" Canucks still improving . Canada have appeared in every World Cup since 1987 and have already qualified for the 2015 tournament. in England. Going into this year's tournament, the Canucks were the top qualifying Americas team and have continued to improve in rank throughout the year. But they have only made it past the pool phase once, in 1991, where they were knocked out in the quarterfinals by New Zealand. Canada entered this years tournament in good stead with victories over the U.S. and maintained that form with a 25-20 success over Tonga. Defeat against France followed, before a tense 23-23 draw against Japan. Former Canadian international Gareth Rees told CNN: ""They've been really honest and hardworking in this tournament despite not everything being perfect. In terms of their attitude and setting up for the next four years, it's been an outstanding World Cup."" Canada were thrashed 79-15 by host nation and tournament favorites New Zealand in their final match and Rees believes if the Canucks want to improve on the international stage, they need to re-evaluate their structure, beginning with a bigger pool of players to choose from. ""The biggest issue is we have is to be playing at a higher intensity,"" he said. ""We need more regular games at a higher level, so when we get to the pool games, the intensity and the mental preparation isn't quite as much of a shock to the system. ""I'd like to see us knocking on the door, like when Tonga upset France. I'd like it if Canada could be that team upsetting other teams -- I think we can get up there to being at the top of the Tier 2 nations.""","Canada, Georgia and the U.S. are emerging as leading contenders in world rugby .

"(CNN) -- Move aside oom-pah bands. The new Germany has no space for your lederhosen-clad image. And forget that dark German music scene promulgated by metal industrial bands like Rammstein. Here comes Madsen, a four-piece indie rock band with heart and high-energy live shows. They are one of the most popular new bands in Germany, with several top 10 hits. Madsen is made up of brothers Sebastian, Johannes and Sascha Madsen and their friend Nico Maurer. They are touring the United States to promote the German language and their audience is mostly high school and college students like 10th grader Maya Dudley of Chamblee, Georgia. She saw the band in Athens on a field trip with her German class. ""Most of their songs sound like anything you would hear on the radio here,"" she says. Their sound has been compared to Green Day and the band members claim Nirvana as one of their influences. Their lyrics are smart, fun and distinctly German. ""Our English isn't very good,"" said Madsen's lead singer, Sebastian Madsen, in his first interview in English. While he only has a slight accent, he's not ready to translate into English any of their more popular tunes like ""Du schreibst Geschichte"" (You Write History)  or ""Mein Herz bleibt hier (My Heart Stays Here)"". ""It's more interesting to sing German in America, because it's a challenge for the people here,"" he says. That's why the entire tour is sponsored by the German government, the European Recovery Program and others interested in promoting Germany's culture and language, such as the Goethe Institute. ""In the U.S., many German programs have been cut down,"" says the Goethe Institute's Bjoern Technau. German language education is being pushed out by other languages, like Mandarin Chinese, according to a 2009 survey by the Center of Applied Linguistics. ""We try to keep German on the screen, so to speak."" Technau says. The 12-city Madsen tour is supposed to help. The band has been playing mostly in school auditoriums in the daytime. The audiences are American students who dance and sing along in perfect German. That's because they have studied the lyrics in class. The Goethe Institute developed lesson plans for German teachers around the band's songs. ""Mad about German -- Mad about Madsen"" is the tag line for the U.S. tour. Besides getting kids interested in the language, Madsen wants to push out German music stereotypes one American auditorium at a time. ""German music still has the reputation of being somewhat dark,"" says Sebastian Madsen. ""We want to counter this clichÃ© and surprise our audiences."" One big surprise is that Madsen's live shows are just as energetic in a school auditorium as they are at a huge Berlin music festival. ""It doesn't matter if there are 10 people or 10,000, we always want to give a good show for everybody. That's very important to us,"" says drummer Sascha Madsen. The last date on Madsen's U.S. concert tour will be November 18 in Denver.","German rock band Madsen is touring the States .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- After weeks of headlines about the outage of its hacker-compromised online gaming system, Sony on Monday looked to change the conversation with Playstation Vita, a machine they say will ""revolutionize"" handheld game play. The gaming system, which will be available by this year's holiday season, marries advances in portable gaming with the Playstation's longstanding gaming pedigree, said Sony president of consumer products Kazuo Hirai. ""Playstation Vita will revolutionize the portable entertainment experience,"" he said. ""It is an experience you really need to see and feel to believe."" The Vita was unveiled as part of Sony's presentation on the eve of the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, which officially begins Tuesday. The device will have a 5-inch touch screen and feature front and back-mounted cameras and touch pads in addition to a pair of mounted joysticks. The system will let players use any, or all, of those controls during a game. With more than 80 titles already in development, according to Sony, the Vita will offer cross-platform play, letting players continue some games between the Vita and the Playstation or, in some cases, even play multiplayer games against others using either a Vita or Playstation. The Wi-Fi only version will sell for $249 and a 3G model, with exclusive AT&T service, will be $299. The Vita, which Sony had been calling the NGP (next-generation portable) before its official unveiling, marks the company's biggest advance in the handheld gaming space since it introduced the Sony PSP in 2006. It doesn't feature 3D gaming, like rival Nintendo's 3DS, which was rolled out at last year's E3. But Hirai teased that the dual cameras will be used in another emerging video-game space -- augmented reality. ""With Playstation Vita, the whole world really is in play,"" he said. John Davidson, of gaming website GameSpot, liked what he saw of the Vita after an early look, calling its visual fidelity ""remarkable."" ""Definitely closer to handheld 'HD' experience than previous handhelds,"" he said in an email to CNN. Jack Tretton, president of Sony Computer Entertainment of America, didn't waste time Monday addressing the hacker-caused outage that had the Playstation Network down for the better part of a month for most players. He called it the ""elephant in the room"" and thanked gamers for staying loyal during the down time. ""You are the lifeblood of this company. Without you there is no Playstation,"" Tretton said. ""I want to apologize, both personally and on behalf of the company, for any anxiety we caused you. ""I know we took you away from what you enjoy most ... and it is you that causes us both to be humble and amazed at the amount of dedication and support you continue to give to the Playstation brand."" Noting the weeks of negative headlines, he jokingly said ""you're welcome"" to members of the media. He said that more than 90 percent of users have returned to the online network, which saw its online store returned last week. Sony also kept up the push for 3-D gaming Monday by taking on what's been considered one of the key stumbling blocks to its success: Price. Acknowledging that the cost of 3-D television remains prohibitive for many gamers, Tretton announced that Sony will be making a Playstation-branded 3-D console that will sell, along with a set of 3-D glasses and the upcoming 3-D game ""Resistance 3,"" for $499. The 24-inch console, which can also be used to watch 3-D movies and television, offers a split-screen mode for multi-player gaming. ""We know that gaming is going to drive 3-D adoption,"" Tretton said. Among the upcoming games Sony featured, the two that got the most attention were ""Uncharted: Drake's Deception"" and ""Bioshock: Infinite."" Both will be available for the Playstation and Vita.","Device will have 5-inch touch screen, cameras, touch pads and a pair of mounted joysticks .

"(CNN) -- Some manufacturers of consumer-grade speaker systems are scrambling to make their products compatible with Apple's wireless features. The first audio equipment with out-of-the-box support for Apple AirPlay protocol debuted in April. The feature allows users to press a button on their iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad or iTunes software and instantly transmit audio from the device to the speaker system over a Wi-Fi connection. Some audio equipment companies say they're feeling the pressure to add this Apple-specific feature to more of their product lines. That comes as Apple is mulling whether it will scale back or entirely do away with the iPod-dock speakers and alarm clocks it sells in its retail stores, according to a person familiar with Apple's discussions who was not authorized to discuss the plans. Apple's proposal to cut back on the supply of dock products it carries was first reported by Twice, a consumer-electronics trade publication. An Apple spokeswoman didn't respond to a request for comment. Apple's push for AirPlay is consistent with a history of flexing its influence to shape partners' businesses, as it did for pricing digital music, enforcing guidelines on accessory makers and changing rules for app developers. Although some Apple product users enjoy having an alarm clock with a dock by their bedsides to charge their phones, AirPlay has notable advantages. Docking a 10-inch tablet like the iPad is impractical, and AirPlay also allows you to transmit music directly from a computer. Apple laid out its grand vision for an untethered computing world on Monday with the announcement of iCloud. That came nine months after Apple announced AirPlay. Apple often nudges its suppliers into supporting new technologies, and one of those ways is by putting its marketing might behind the company's newest offerings, said Ross Rubin, a music-industry analyst for the NPD Group. ""The Apple Store is clearly an important retailer for selling iPod docks, and it is a retailer that strives to showcase the latest technology directions from Apple,"" Rubin said. ""A lot of the products carried in the Apple Stores tend to be at the higher end of the price spectrum."" iPod-dock systems without the wireless bells and whistles should continue to drop in price, serving a large mass market at stores like Best Buy and Walmart, Rubin said. However, for the equipment companies targeting the Apple faithful -- consumers who learn about and buy many of their products at Apple stores -- it's an important venue to occupy. Pioneer Electronics, for one, is hoping to piggyback on Apple's customers. Nearly half of the people who own a Pioneer device also own at least three Apple gadgets, according to a Pioneer survey. Pioneer debuted its first batch of AirPlay-enabled receivers in March and announced five more this week, with all but the base model using AirPlay. Philips is also marching to Apple's tune. ""Philips has several products in the pipeline for the back half of 2011, including a new range that incorporates AirPlay, and we look forward to continuing our partnership with Apple,"" spokeswoman Shannon Jenest said in a statement. Apple had not alerted the company to any changes in distribution plans, she said. Two companies that sell speakers in Apple Stores, Altec Lansing and Harman International, which makes the JBL brand, declined to comment. Another, Bose, didn't respond to requests for comment. Integrating Apple's wireless technology into sound systems doesn't require manufacturers to pay additional licensing fees beyond the one Apple charges for including its iPod dock connector and ""Made for iPod"" sticker, equipment makers say. However, Apple requires that companies use a certain processor in their electronics and, of course, include a Wi-Fi chip, which can increase costs, they said. Where Apple does have ample space, like in its larger stores, speaker inventory appears to be unchanged. But in other Apple retail locations like the one in Fashion Show Mall in Las Vegas, little space is left over since Apple redesigned its stores to include ""personal training"" and ""personal setup"" stations. There, Jawbone's Jambox, a small rectangular gadget that uses Bluetooth for wireless transmission instead of AirPlay, is hanging on a wall in the back rather than on display like it is in other Apple Stores. Jawbone is confident it's in a better position by embracing wireless technology, CEO Hosain Rahman wrote in an e-mailed statement. ""We think docks are dead,"" Rahman wrote. ""We need devices that can keep up with our on-the-go lifestyle. You shouldn't be tethered to a dock."" Sonos, a wireless speaker system, isn't carried by Apple and sells most of its units through Best Buy and Amazon.com. Sonos uses a proprietary wireless system but recently added a workaround for AirPlay. The 8-year-old company began specializing in wireless music services long before the equipment makers turned their attention to that market. ""In many ways, docks were more like CD players, tape players or record players in that you take this thing, and you stick it in,"" Sonos co-founder Thomas Cullen said. ""Building an iPod dock was not very different from building a CD player."" Now, many equipment makers are looking at wireless options, and some are taking a scattershot approach. AirPlay, Bluetooth and DLNA, another standard that works with Windows computers and some Android devices, are making their way into audio receivers, and in some cases, all three. Add a dock to that, and you might have a product too big to fit on Apple's shelves.","Audio equipment makers are scrambling to support AirPlay .

"(CNN)  -- Glitzy Dubai lures globetrotters with its modern architectural wonders and a bounty of luxury shopping, dining and lodging. This United Arab Emirates metropolis boasts ""sunshine, shopping, seaside, sports and safety"" as key selling points on its tourism website. Caroline Faraj is CNN's chief operations director in Dubai and editor of CNN Arabic. Faraj, originally from Jordan, moved to Dubai in December 2001. We asked Faraj to share her tips for visiting this dynamic city: . Where can you get the best view of the city? At Burj Khalifa, which is the tallest building in the world. The tower's observation deck, At The Top, is located on level 124. To which restaurant would you take your loved one for an anniversary or other special occasion? Try Pierchic at Madinat Jumeirah Hotel. This romantic restaurant is at the end of a pier that stretches over the waters of the Persian Gulf. Time Out Dubai named Pierchic as the best seafood restaurant in 2010. Where is the best place to people watch? The Dancing Fountain at Burj Khalifa. On a lake outside, choreographed water shows are put on multiple times each evening. What is your favorite neighborhood? Zabeel Park, where you can run, walk, play games, barbecue, rent a boat on a small lake or visit the space and science museum. This park stretches over about 117 acres in central Dubai. What's the best way to blend in? Visit one of the souks (markets), like the gold market, or spice, textile or fish souks. What's the biggest misconception about your city? Some come to Dubai with a misconception that you can do whatever you want in Dubai. To a certain extent that might be true, but there are restrictions, rules and the need to respect the culture of the country. For example, with regards to consuming alcohol, only Christian ex-pats can apply for a license to buy alcohol from special shops, but visitors can find it in hotels, too. Where do you go to relax? I go to a spa, and the best one is at the Park Hyatt. The hotel's Amara spa is on the banks of the Dubai Creek. I also go sometimes to a resort to enjoy the beach. What essential thing should visitors see/experience if they only have a few hours? Take a creek tour in an abra, a small crossing boat. And if there is time, take the bus tour that gives you a quick briefing on the architecture and souks as well as the desert safari trip in the middle of the dunes. Where's your favorite place to spend a night out on the town? Trader Vic's with its Cuban live music. Are there local specialty dishes or drinks that visitors must try? If you like seafood, then I would recommend trying fish cooked the traditional way, which is either salt cured (called maleh), sun-dried (Al kaseef) or ground dried fish (sahnah). What is a good local souvenir? The United Arab Emirates is a federation of seven emirates, so I would suggest the bottles that have sands in seven colors coming from the seven emirates.","CNN's Caroline Faraj recommends a Dubai Creek tour to visitors .

"Los Angeles (CNN)  -- Keep debating whether video games are art if you wish. At E3, the world's biggest gaming expo, it's a closed question. Here, video games are definitely art -- and a gallery-style exhibit aims to prove it to as many people as care to look. ""Into the Pixel,"" a juried art show now in its eighth year, opened on Tuesday, showcasing work that supporters say is finally receiving its just due in the sometimes-cloistered art world. ""There actually is no line at all between the video-game artist and the fine-art world,"" said Nora Dolan, an independent curator who has worked at galleries including the Ansel Adams Museum in San Francisco and the Whitney Museum in New York and was one of the jurors for the show. ""There's no difference to me. This is as high-quality an exhibit as could be."" Seventeen images were selected for the show out of hundreds of submissions. After showing at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the exhibit will spend the next year traveling to festivals and conventions around the world. As may be expected, there were dragons and spaceships, creepy monsters and brave heroes depicted in the show. But other pieces might not be pegged as video-game images at all if not for the setting. ""Oktonok Cay Cannery,"" by David Guertin from the game ""Ratchet & Clank: All 4 One,"" is a rendering of a highly abstracted shipyard that wouldn't look out of place next to work by Salvador Dali. ""The Pelican,"" by Andrew Kim from ""Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception,"" is a detailed look at the interior of an empty and vaguely ominous East End London pub. The prints on display at the opening in the Los Angeles Convention Center were created for video games that range from massive hits from major companies to small, independent games. Some were touched up slightly for their gallery debut, but many are directly lifted from gameplay. Tyler Breon's entry, ""Cronos Battle,"" from last year's ""God of War III,"" depicts an enormous monster hulking over the game's main character, peering down at him with a look hovering somewhere between perplexed and annoyed. Breon, a senior character artist for Sony, had his first gallery showing at ""Into the Pixel."" Video-game art, like other emerging art forms, needed time to earn wider acceptance, he said. ""You look at all kinds of media that were new -- anything that's new, people aren't really comfortable with initially,"" he said, citing the way comic-book art is now taken seriously, but only after decades of scorn. ""I think the longer they're exposed to it, they come to be more comfortable with it."" The past year may have been a turning point in the art world's comfort with video games. The Smithsonian Institution announced that, in 2012, it will be opening ""The Art of Video Games,"" an exhibition spanning four decades of gaming images. And, last month, the National Endowment for the Arts announced video games would join film, radio and other media that are eligible for government support. ""There are signs that this is really happening,"" said Martin Rae, president of the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences which, along with the Entertainment Software Association, sponsors ""Into the Pixel."" ""We now have a realization within the government that what we do is art,"" Rae said. Rae compares video-game art to photography. In its infancy, art communities dismissed photo-taking as a simple act of point-and-shoot, merely copying an image that already existed. ""I think we had the same thing here,"" he said. ""But the public is catching up."" By showcasing the work in ""Into the Pixel,"" Rae and others hope to speed that process. ""Every time traditional fine arts people look at what we have in our industry, they immediately recognize that the artists within our industry are exceptional,"" he said.","Supporters say video game art is finally receiving its just due .

"(CNN) -- Mansour Daou is known as the ""Black Box"" of Moammar Gadhafi's regime -- like an aircraft's data recorder, he knows some of Libya's darkest secrets. And as one of Gadhafi's top security officials, who remained at his side until the final hours, Daou has a unique insight into the astonishing downfall of Africa's longest-serving leader. Now in an interview with CNN he describes how the dictator, who was once of the world's most feared leaders, was forced to scavenge for food and hide in abandoned houses in the coastal city of Sirte. ""He was very worried and erratic -- this could be because he was afraid,"" Daou said. According to Daou, Gadhafi became desperate to travel to his birthplace, the village of Jaref, 20 kilometers west of Sirte, a journey that Daou feared was ""suicide."" ""He wanted to go to his village, maybe he wanted to die there or spend his last moments there,"" he said. Finally, after NATO jets attacked his convoy, Gadhafi tried to escape on foot through drainage pipes, but was caught. He was later killed in circumstances that are still far from clear. Gadhafi's autopsy reveals he was shot in head . Daou spoke as he awaited trial at a detention facility in the city of Misrata, which bore the brunt of the regime's most brutal assault during the conflict. The most significant charges he faces relate to his alleged role in the Abu Salim prison massacre in 1996, and his role in the alleged hiring of African mercenaries by the regime during the conflict. He told CNN he had no role in those events. The interview was initially delayed by a few hours -- officials said Daou was being interrogated and asked CNN to return in the evening to speak to him. The CNN crew was taken to the bottom floor of the building and led into a conference room where Daou sat at a long table with his interrogator -- a tall, tough-looking Libyan man. Daou, in his late 50s, wore a traditional Arabic gray dishdasha robe and seemed to be in good health. During the hour-long interview, Daou described how he had been in the same car as Gadhafi as they made their chaotic escape from the former leader's hometown of Sirte. Gadhafi left Tripoli for Sirte on August 18, according to Daou -- just two days before fighters seeking to oust him entered the capital. Daou said he remained in Tripoli until it became clear the city was no longer safe for the regime's top tier. He then fled to the city of Bani Walid on August 22, along with Gadhafi's son, Saif al-Islam and intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi. He stayed with them for four days before joining the former dictator in Sirte. Daou said their living conditions went from bad to worse as the rebels tightened their siege of the city. They moved around abandoned houses every three to four days, he said, surviving on the little food they could find. Towards the end, they had no power, water or communication with the outside world. ""Our lives had turned by about 180 degrees."" Gadhafi spent his final days writing and reading books he had stacked in suitcases, Daou said, but his behavior became more unpredictable. As fighters surrounded Sirte, Gadhafi's group wanted to leave the city. Daou said he and others knew that if they did not leave before the siege there would be no way out. But Gadhafi refused to leave -- until October 20 -- when he and his son Mutassem decided to make the move to the former dictator's birthplace. Their group of about 350 men had dropped to fewer than 200, according to Daou. ""It started dropping daily with some killed, others wounded and those who had left with their families,"" he said. Daou described their force as a mostly undisciplined civilian one under the command of Mutassem. They had no plan -- not for fleeing and certainly not for fighting. Their convoy of more than 40 vehicles was supposed to head out before dawn when they thought anti-Gadhafi forces would be resting -- but they were too late. At about 8 a.m. they set out to Gadhafi's birthplace but NATO jets quickly struck one of the vehicles in the convoy. The impact of the explosion triggered the airbags in the car and Gadhafi sustained a slight injury to his head or chest. Daou remembered a scene of chaos, confusion and horror. As they tried to escape he says anti-Gadhafi fighters opened fire on their cars as they attempted to flee. Then a second airstrike by NATO followed. ""That is when we had the most casualties and destroyed vehicles, our car was hit after we got out of it. Here were many injured: someone lost an arm, another a leg, some were dead. It was terrifying,"" Daou recalled. They had no option but to run; their escape on foot ended with heavy fire from fighters who surrounded them by the drainage pipes they were using to escape through. Daou said he lost consciousness after he was hit by shrapnel in his back and does not know how Gadhafi died. The death of Gadhafi ended the possibility of an insurgency that his loyalists could have mounted, he believes. ""The regime and any power it may have had died with Gadhafi,"" he said. The legacy of Libya's former dictator is now being debated. ""It will be up to the historians, everyone has their opinion, some see him as a dictator who killed his own people, and there is an opposite view. History is usually written by the more powerful,"" he said. Gadhafi believed he could remain in power, Daou said, adding that he and other members of the inner circle tried to convince the former strongman to leave the country since March ""to leave with respect ... to save face."" His sons rejected the idea, especially Saif: ""It is not easy for someone who had been in power for 42 years, to believe that it is over in a minute,"" Daou said. Daou said he had no idea where the former regime's most wanted men -- Saif and al-Senussi -- were. But with the International Criminal Court pursuing them, he believes they are probably still in Libya as no country will take them. ICC: Mercenaries may try to help Gadhafi son escape . When asked if he thought Saif, who during the conflict vowed to fight until the end, was a fighter, Daou laughed quietly and said: ""I don't know -- I don't think so."" As unrest broke out in the region in January, officials in Libya were worried, Daou recalled. ""There was fear and there was concern that this wave could reach Libya and the feeling was right,"" he said. Daou said he was in a car with Gadhafi and al-Senussi driving back to Tripoli from Sabha in the south when news reached them about the ousting of the president of neighboring Tunisia. He said they had a serious discussion, but the threat was not taken seriously. According to Daou, Gadhafi felt betrayed by world leaders he considered allies. ""He spoke of friends he said let him down, and did not stand by him, like (Italian Prime Minister Silvio) Berlusconi, (former British prime minister) Tony Blair, the French president (Nicolas Sarkozy) and (Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip) Erdogan,"" Daou said. But a bigger betrayal came from within. Daou says there was a defense plan in place for the capital, but it was treason among the ranks of those who were tasked with securing Tripoli that led to the fall of the capital in a few days. He said more than 3,800 troops were supposed to guard Tripoli's gates, but on the night anti-Gadhafi fighters entered the capital, fewer than 200 troops were on duty. ""There was big betrayal by the general who was in charge -- it was his brigade that was in charge. Tanks and military vehicles had no crews, watch towers were abandoned, security forces withdrew from the streets because this brigade was not present,"" Daou said. With the regime he served for decades now history, Daou awaits trial by Libya's new rulers. He told us in the presence of his interrogators he is being treated well -- but has yet to see a lawyer whom he has requested. Daou has not visited Tripoli since August. He has no TV and does not know what it looks like now, with his former regime's green flags replaced by the new national flags and walls covered with anti-Gadhafi graffiti. He says the revolution was the people's will and they won -- now he says they have to preserve it -- and Libya's unity. Asked if he regretted being part of the regime, he sighed and chuckled. ""Sometimes I regret everything, I have even regretted being alive, of course a person has regrets at a time in his life and looks back but unfortunately you sometimes regret when it is too late."" CNN's Raja Razek contributed to this report.","Mansour Daou was one of Moammar Gadhafi's top security officials .

"(CNN) -- Move over, Cookie Monster. And pipe down, Oscar the Grouch. There's a new muppet in town, and she's hungry. Her name is Lily, and the newest member of the muppet pantheon symbolizes a serious social condition in today's recessionary era: nationwide hunger. Colored pink and sporting long pigtails, Lily has been designed by Sesame Street to look like a 7-year-old girl. Her character confronts a growing national struggle -- food insecurity. Her story offers an optimistic scenario of how the community at large is supporting her and her family. Sesame Street and the Jim Henson Co. are introducing this new muppet in an hour-long special, ""Growing Hope Against Hunger,"" Sunday on PBS. In the special, Lily is prompted to make a revelation when one of the more popular muppets -- Elmo -- remarks that he ""didn't know there were so many people who didn't have the food they needed."" Lily then confesses to him that she doesn't know where her next meal is coming from and that times can be difficult. Food insecurity is defined as the lack of a consistent access to food for active, healthy lives, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The USDA says 14.5% of households were food insecure at least some time during 2010 and that 5.4% of households experienced very low food security the same year. ""Numerous studies suggest that children in food-insecure households have higher risks of health and development problem than children in otherwise similar food-secure households,"" the USDA says. The Great Recession, which set off a wave of layoffs and plummeting home values, left many families without access to adequate food. Since 2001, the number of households receiving emergency food has grown steadily, according to the USDA. The most significant increase took place between 2007 and 2009 -- during the recession -- when the number of households making use of food pantries rose from 3.9 million to 5.6 million, an increase of 44%, according to the USDA. Sesame Street really wanted to convey the scope of the problem, a spokeswoman said. Many children whose families suffer food insecurity are part of the program's target audience, said Rocio Galarza, senior director for content and outreach at the Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind Sesame Street. ""We made very specific choices for this characters so it conveyed the message that anyone could be going through this,"" Galarza said. ""It could be your neighbor, could be part of your family sometimes. The character is going through this with her family but is benefiting from the support of her entire community."" This isn't the first Sesame Street muppet with a social message: The show has previously featured Jesse, whose father passed away, as a character dealing with the issue of grief. Sesame Street in South Africa also has an HIV-positive muppet named Tammy.","Lily is a pink muppet with long pigtails, resembling a 7-year-old girl .

"(CNN) -- The musician Bjork is releasing the first ever app-album. It's called ""Biophilia,"" and it goes on sale in the Apple App Store on Tuesday. The app-album is a collection of games, visualizations and musical scores that accompany Bjork's songs, which also is available for a traditional audio-only download. Each song, in effect, becomes its own visual-and-audio experience, letting Bjork's fans interact with her songs in an entirely new way. The main ""Biophilia"" app is available for free. Each sub-application, which contains a song and some sort of interactive game, costs 99-cents, or $9.99 for the whole album. A non-app version of the album also is available. The Icelandic artist is known for being innovative. Her 2004 album ""Medulla"" was composed almost entirely from human voices, which were remixed into a myriad of sounds. On ""Volta,"" she used touch-sensitive instruments that predate the iPad. ""Apps and iPads are just tools -- they have to be human and they have to have soul,"" she said. Bjork sat down with CNN to talk about the creative process and purpose behind ""Biophilia."" You can listen to a CNN Radio Report podcast of the interview. The following is a transcript: . CNN: How did the idea of creating an app for your album or wanting to make your music interactive first come about? Bjork: Well, believe it or not, this project started because I wanted to simplify things, and then ended up being one of the most complex things I've done. But the initial idea, in a way, was because of the arrival of the touch screen. I was already on my last tour from 2006 to 2008, the ""Volta"" tour. I had a touch screen instrument called the Lemur and another one called Reactable. And I was performing or people who were playing with me in the band were on those. Once the tour was finished in 2008, I was excited not just to perform with touch screens, but to write with them or kind of use it as much as you could. For me, it tapped into an issue I had as a child and sort of had since. CNN: Even before you started with this project and started developing with these technologies to write these songs in creative ways, what has been your experience with listening to music? How do you experience music? Is this something you wish had been around before as a way for you to interact with other artists' music? Bjork: That's a good question, I never really thought about that. Yeah, for sure! People obviously tend to be scared of new tools and always think they have no soul in them. The reason why there is no soul in them is because no one put it there, like you cannot really blame the tool ... Obviously technology is so sophisticated now that you ... don't have to be the biggest programming genius on Earth to do it. You can do it now in a simple way. And I feel if some of my favorite musicians would do something like this, it would obviously be important that they would do something that is idiosyncratic for them. That it is not just accessorizing their music just for the novelty factor. Because tools are just tools and obviously apps and iPads are just tools, they have to be human and they have to have soul. CNN: Could you elaborate on the educational workshops that you'll be doing and why they are important for you? Bjork: The core of this project is kind of educational, not only that I want to teach basic musicology for beginners, but it actually ended up being the project that I learned most. I feel like I've been three years in this intense university. So that's really the core of the project. It's hard to say why. Maybe I'll look back in 10 years time and say why. It felt like the shows are only a part when I'm obviously singing and expressing myself. But it also had to be the other angle where the kids could come and they could express themselves and be interactive. So far, we've gotten offers from some natural history museums and science museums around the planet. Because it would be nice if it was not just the musical side of things, but also the biological. For example, they could come in and they could play with crystals and biologists could tell them about crystals. And musicologists could tell them about structures in music. Then they can get the app to try it out, write their own little songs, and put it on a USB key and take it home. That's the way I think it will work best in the spirit of the project. It cannot really be without that aspect. CNN: What do you hope people can get out of this app and this experience of interacting with your music? Bjork: For me, obviously, I want to show that there's connection between nature and music ... It's kind of an interesting project because I understand it more now that I am doing interviews than when I was doing it -- that the core or idea of this project is taking something that has usually been quite academic or bookish and making it impulsive and tactile. So actually explaining it or doing an interview about it or writing or reading a press release about it, makes it sound like 500 times more complicated that it actually is. It's like trying to explain how to dance in an e-mail. If you would just turn it on and do it together, it'd be way easier. I am hoping that it would sort of dissolve this VIP status that musicology has -- that's in only for the chosen few, if you are super clever, and you've studied for billions of years, you understand about scales.","Bjork's new album, ""Biophilia,"" debuts on Tuesday .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli sailors boarded two aid ships headed to the Palestinian territory of Gaza on Friday, the Israeli military said. While no resistance was reported, activists criticized the Israeli action as ""illegal"" and vowed that activists ""will keep coming, wave after wave"" to try to deliver aid to Palestinians in Gaza. Activists on board the ""Freedom Waves to Gaza"" mini-flotilla were ""attempting to break the maritime security blockade that is in place in accordance with international law,"" the Israeli military said, and were refusing to heed their calls to turn back. ""The boarding was carried out in line with directives from the Israeli government and after all attempts to prevent the vessels from reaching the Gaza Strip were made, but to no avail,"" the military said. ""The boarding was carried out following numerous calls to the activists on board and during different points at sea. Following their unwillingness to cooperate, and after ignoring calls to divert to the port of Ashdod, the decision was made to board the vessels and lead them there."" Sailors ""took every precaution necessary to ensure the safety of the activists on board the vessels as well as themselves,"" the Israel Defense Forces said. Activists will be handed over to Israeli police and immigration authorities, the military said. According to the activist organizers, this mission was the eleventh attempt to run Israel's blockade of Gaza by sea. Five missions arrived safely in Gaza between August and December 2008, with the rest intercepted by Israel. The activists said Friday that ""ground support crews lost contact with two ships, the Saoirse of Ireland and the Tahrir of Canada."" It said there are 27 civilian passengers. The boats are carrying medical supplies and letters of support for people in Gaza. The activists said the navy interrogated people on the Tahrir around 7:30 a.m., when it was about 48 nautical miles from the Gaza coast. Thirteen minutes later, ground support crews lost contact with two ships. Asked by the Israeli Navy for their destination, Canadian activist Ehab Lotayef replied, ""The conscience of humanity,"" the activists' said in a statement. When they repeated the question, asking for final destination, Lotayef said, ""The betterment of mankind."" Kit Kittredge, an American traveling with the Tahrir, said Israelis made contact with the group and told them to change their radio channel. Kittredge said the group declined to do so. Late Thursday, two Israeli navy ships shadowed the ships before pulling back, the group said. The activists said the ships had been ""illegally boarded."" ""It's clear that 27 civilians on two small boats, carrying only medicine, constituted no security threat to the Israeli state, and that the determination to keep them out is only a furtherance of Israel's policy of collective punishment, a crime against humanity,"" said Huwaida Arraf, spokeswoman for Freedom Waves to Gaza. ""Despite this Israeli aggression, we will keep coming, wave after wave, by air, sea, and land, to challenge Israel's illegal policies towards Gaza and all of Palestine,"" Arraf said. ""Our movement will not stop or be stopped until Palestine is free."" Jane Hirschmann, U.S. coordinator for the Freedom Waves to Gaza flotilla, said, ""Had the passengers been permitted to proceed to Gaza rather than being stopped on the high seas by armed force, there would have been no threat to their safety. The IDF's statement is like the mugger promising to escort his victim home safely."" Ann Wright, one of the organizers of the Freedom Flotilla that attempted to sail to Gaza last June, said,""It's a little hard to imagine how 27 unarmed civilians on two small boats carrying medicine and letters threaten Israel's security. Israel is simply determined to maintain its policy of collective punishment against the 1.6 million civilians in Gaza. This is a crime against humanity and violation of international law. Despite Israel's consistent use of military force against nonviolent protests and demonstrations, activists around the world will continue to challenge the occupation of Palestine and the blockade and Gaza."" Passengers on the boats are from Canada, Ireland, the United States, Australia, and the Palestinian territories, the activists say. The flotillas have sparked international controversy. In 2010, an Israeli raid on one flotilla ship, the Mavi Marmara, resulted in nine Turkish activists being killed, a development that led to the deterioration of relations between Israel and Turkey, once close allies. Israel was roundly criticized by many over the deaths. A U.N. report criticized Israel for its use of excessive force in the incident but described the blockade -- which activists call illegal -- as a ""legitimate security measure."" Israel says it is concerned about the smuggling of arms to Gaza militants intent on attacking the Jewish state. Gaza is controlled by the anti-Israel Hamas militant group, regarded as a terrorist group by the United States and Israel, . But activists say Israeli embargoes of goods into Gaza from land and sea are collective punishment of civilians in what is a tiny and densely populated strip of land along the Mediterranean coast. Israel has said any organization or state that wants to give humanitarian aid to Gaza can do so in coordination with Israeli authorities via existing land crossings into the Palestinian territory. CNN's Kareem Khadder and Nicky Robertson contributed to this report.","Activists are from different countries .

"Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- When I'm not on the road working, I want to feel as if I'm on vacation. That's why I live in Fort Lauderdale. I travel a lot for work and for pleasure, but every time I walk through my door, I say to my husband, ""I love our home."" Fort Lauderdale, just north of Miami, is a beautiful oceanfront town known for seven miles of sandy beach. When I'm in town, I take advantage of a path that gives bicyclists an ocean view while they exercise. This inviting stretch of sand became popular when it was shown on the big screen in the 1960 film ""Where the Boys Are,"" starring Connie Frances and George Hamilton. Things have changed a lot in Fort Lauderdale since that movie. The strip, the section along the beach where most of the shops, hotels and restaurants are congregated, is still there, and the businesses have gone upscale over the past few years. But you still don't have to dress fancy even for the finest restaurants. Fort Lauderdale has embraced the laid-back beach culture where a nice pair of jeans with a presentable shirt is fine in almost any establishment. An everyman's guide to L.A. Where can you get the best view of the city? No one cares about the city views when you can look at the beach and the blue Atlantic Ocean. So, I'll tell you the best place to sit, have a drink and look at the beach. The recently opened deck at McSorley's Beach Pub has a great unobstructed view of the ocean and is walking distance from the strip. On a night when the moon is not reflecting off the water and the ocean is obscure, you need to travel only a block or two from the beach to the Intracoastal Waterway. There, you can sit at any of the restaurants or bars on the waterway and watch the boats go by. If you're traveling with children, the best place to go is to Benihana; when you aren't being entertained by the chef, you can look out the window and watch boats of all sizes go by. International correspondent shares Moscow tips . Which restaurant would you take your loved one to for an anniversary or other special occasion? We would go to one of several restaurants, depending on our mood and how much we want to spend. I know I'm going to get in trouble with some locals for making this public, but Sage French Café and Café Vico are two very good restaurants off the tourist trail. They are a few minutes from the beach in strip malls. Sage French Café never disappoints. The price is right, and the meal is always good. You can bring your own bottle of wine for a $15 corkage fee. The bar serves only beer and wine. If you want a full bar and great Italian food, go to Café Vico. It is also hard to resist a maître de, who is really the owner, greeting you as if you grew up in the old country together. We always order a plate of gnocchi as an appetizer to share with the table. It's wonderful, but it's too rich to eat as a meal. If it's seafood you crave, then you must go see chef Dean Max at 3030 Ocean in the Marriott Harbor Beach hotel. While you're there, make sure you congratulate the chef for wining last year's Great American Seafood Cook-Off. He was handpicked by the governor to represent Florida and compete against chefs from 13 states. I am proud to tell you that chef Max brought home the bacon -- bragging rights for the Sunshine State. Speaking of bacon, if it's meat you're hungry for and you have plenty of money to spend, order the Kobe beef at Steak 954 in the W hotel. An 8-ounce Kobe fillet is $65, but the entire menu is not that expensive. You can get a regular 8-ounce fillet for $35. Aside from the food, a highlight here is the jellyfish tank; it's worth, at the least, going to the bar for a drink. What is your favorite neighborhood? I'm not sure it has a name, but all my friends know where to find me when I'm in town. I call it my favorite beach block. It is on the beach and Sunrise Boulevard, about a mile north of the strip. This three-block radius has something for everyone. After the sun goes down and you get a drink at McSorley's, you can walk across the street to the Parrot Lounge. I recently became the Foursquare ""mayor"" of the Parrot Lounge, although my mother thinks I should own the place by now. The friendly staff has retained me as a loyal customer for decades. For many locals, this is our version of Cheers. But instead of a Norm, we have a Rich who can always be found at the end of the bar. The Parrot is known by locals as a ""Philly bar."" It caters to Philadelphia's sports teams, and the place is packed when the Flyers, Phillies, Eagles or even Penn State has a televised game. The extensive menu includes foods that Philadelphia is known for such as cheesesteak and soft pretzels. Even if you can't find Philadelphia on a map, it's a fun place where tourists and locals mix. Doors away from the Parrot, you will find a Thai restaurant, smoke shop, kava bar, St. Barts coffee shop, tattoo parlors, bar/restaurant Cafe Bluefish, Yo Mama's homemade ice cream shop  and a couple of shops selling T-shirts and souvenirs. It's also where you'll see my husband every Sunday at about 6 p.m. picking up pizza from my favorite spot, Primanti Bros. This beachfront sandwich shop is open 24 hours a day and serves the best pizza in town. How do tourists stick out? Knowing a person is a tourist is easy in Florida. I think our engineer Max Lewis said it best: ""You look for the pink people. We used to call them flamingos when I was a kid."" I'm not sure that the term is still used, but the pink people continue to be one good way to tell when someone is in town on vacation. If their sunburn doesn't give them away, things like a Hawaiian shirt or camera around the neck will. A tip: Save your money on the new shirt and buy good sunscreen! Is there a tourist trap actually worth seeing? The Jungle Queen riverboat has been transporting tourists around Fort Lauderdale's canals and New River for as long as I can remember. The tour guides are funny and informative as they point out the multimillion-dollar homes on the water and the names of famous residents who live there. This tour allows you to see these residences from behind the gates. They also stop on their own island, where you can watch an alligator being wrestled. If you want to see an alligator in its natural habitat, I advise you to rent a car and drive to Shark Valley in the Florida Everglades. It's not in Fort Lauderdale but worth the trip! It was only last year when I discovered this spot, and I haven't stopped talking about it since. I have never seen so many alligators in one place. I was so amazed by what I saw that I wrote a story for CNN's Travel page. Have you been to Fort Lauderdale? Share your tips in the comments section below.","Fort Lauderdale's best views are of the water with cocktails in hand .

"(CNN) -- Most conservationists would agree that you should not interfere with mother nature. But there are exceptions to every rule. Staff and tourists at Kapani Safari Lodge in Zambia were caught by surprise when a mother and baby elephant became trapped in mud. Saying they couldn't just ""stand by and watch them slowly die,"" what ensued was a dramatic rescue. Together with the South Luangwa Conservation Society (SLCS) and the local wildlife authority, the team devised a plan to get the elephants out. The rest of the herd initially tried to help the screaming mother and baby escape, but they were stuck too deep. Team managers from the conservation society slipped a rope around the baby and after a few attempts managed to pull her out of the muddy pit. The team says it took a lot of coaxing to get her out and on her feet though, adding that she ""was terribly frightened and wouldn't leave her mum's side"". Getting the adult elephant out of the mud was a far more challenging task -- by the time the baby had been rescued, its mother was dehydrated and exhausted. But the SLCS team eventually pulled her out too, using a tractor and rope. Staff at Kapani Lodge say it was ""heart-warming to see how many local people joined in the efforts to free the two elephants... it was the happiest possible ending.""","Mother and baby elephant stuck in mud at game lodge in Zambia .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A 24-year-old Connecticut man affiliated with the Anonymous hacking group was arrested and charged Tuesday with electronically attacking the website belonging to Gene Simmons of the rock band KISS, authorities said. Kevin George Poe, of Manchester, Connecticut, made an initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Hartford on Tuesday, and a judge ordered him released in lieu of a $10,000 bond, federal prosecutors said. Poe is charged with two counts: conspiracy and unauthorized impairment of a protected computer, prosecutors said. He was ordered to appear in federal court in Los Angeles at an undetermined date, prosecutors said. The servers to GeneSimmons.com, the website belonging to the KISS band member, are based in Los Angeles, said Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles. Poe's federal public defender didn't respond to messages late Tuesday. Using the screen name of spydr101, Poe joined other persons linked to Anonymous and allegedly conducted a ""distributed denial of service"" attack against Simmons' website during a five-day period in October 2010. That attack allegedly involved sending tens of thousands of electronic requests designed to overload the website and shut it down, a prosecutor's statement said. Poe allegedly used the computer program Low Orbit Ion Cannon -- ""a favorite software tool of the Anonymous collective"" -- to send a high volume of ""packets"" or requests in an effort to overwhelm the server, prosecutors said. If convicted of both charges, Poe could face up to 15 years in federal prison, prosecutors said.","Kevin George Poe, 24, of Connecticut is accused of being an Anonymous hacker .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli officials were working on repairs at a cemetery in an Arab section of the coastal city of Jaffa Sunday after vandals covered graves with graffiti. ""I am shocked. We should not permit it. It was done by a tiny minority, but the crime is terrible,"" Israeli President Shimon Peres told CNN Sunday. ""To try and violate the holiness of a cemetery is against everything that we stand for, so both in public terms and religious terms, we shall take all the measures to get hold of these criminals and put an end to it."" More than 100 graves were vandalized in the Muslim cemetery of al-Kazakhana and at a nearby Christian cemetery in the Ajami neighborhood of Jaffa, according to residents and a CNN producer who visited the locations. Words spray-painted in Hebrew on the gravestones included ""death to all Arabs,"" ""death to all Russians"" and ""price tag."" Graffiti also included words associated with a local football fan club. ""Price tag"" is a term frequently used by radical Israeli settlers to denote reprisal attacks against Palestinians in response to moves by the Israeli government to evacuate illegal West Bank outposts, or as retribution for attacks by Palestinians. Mayor of Tel Aviv-Jaffa Ron Huldai decried the vandalism and met with leaders of the Arab community to discuss it Sunday. ""I expect the hands of those who do such crimes to be cut off,"" he said. ""The public in Jaffa has always been the most mature above all the extremists. We will find the way to return to normal (relations) despite the provocations."" After authorities found the graffiti, Arab and Jewish residents of Jaffa held a small protest against racism and for coexistence Saturday night. During their demonstration, a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a synagogue elsewhere in the city. No one was injured and the building was not damaged in that incident, but police were investigating. The vandalism in Jaffa took place less than a week after the arson of a mosque in northern Israel and the painting of swastikas on the walls of a Jewish holy site in the northern West Bank. Residents say the vandalism took place Friday evening as the Yom Kippur holiday was beginning in Israel, but police suggested it might have taken place a day or two prior. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also condemned the incident Sunday and pledged to prosecute those responsible. ""We are not prepared to tolerate any act of vandalism, especially that directed against religious sensitivities,"" Netanyahu said at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting. Police were still following leads and investigating the case Sunday, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. No arrests had been made. Contrary to previous reports, police said graves were spray painted but were not smashed. Police officials said they had stepped up patrols in the area and were reaching out to community leaders. But one lawmaker said Sunday that officials had not done enough to stop such attacks. ""The Israeli government is responsible, Many times something like this has happened and they did nothing, and so these people who do that are not deterred. They think they will not catch them and they will not be punished,"" said Dr. Jamal Zahalka, a member of the Israeli Knesset. ""We call here now for everybody, Jewish and Arab to unite in a front against racism. The situation is deteriorating rapidly. After the mosque, the cemetery and tomorrow, actions against people. It will not stop "" According to Israeli police, reprisal attacks have increased in the past year, prompting them to create a special investigative unit. In the past year, four West Bank mosques have been set ablaze. The United Nations has reported a measurable spike in violence against Palestinian property in 2011. On Wednesday, a shrine holy to Jews was desecrated in the West Bank. Jewish worshippers arrived at Joseph's Tomb in the city of Nablus to find swastikas and graffiti sprayed on the walls. It is unclear when the graffiti was left there. The site is under Palestinian Authority rule, and Jews visit every couple of months to pray. CNN's Izzy Lemberg, Dan Morgan and Kevin Flower contributed to this report.","Israeli president: ""The crime is terrible (and) against everything that we stand for""

"New York City is the quintessential metropolis, the city other cities aspire to be. Frenetic, chaotic and glamorous, it may not be the capital of America, or even New York State, but in many ways it's the capital of the world. New York's skyscrapers are instantly recognizable architectural icons. More than anywhere else, New York symbolizes the American Dream and the aspirations of the 20th century. Ever since it was christened New Amsterdam in 1694 it has been a beacon for immigrants, the Promised Land where anyone can be anything they want. The ""huddled masses"" who disembarked at Ellis Island under the gaze of the Statue of Liberty built a city on hard work, determination, and a belief that anything was possible. The result is the Big Apple, the city that never sleeps, the place where you can make things happen. New York is a celebrity city -- even if you've never been there you'll recognize it from countless movies and TV cop shows. There's something innately cinematic about its skyline of tapered high-rises reaching towards the heavens. The skyscrapers of Shanghai and Hong Kong may be more modern, and those of Dubai and Kuala Lumpur more immense, but only New York's are instantly recognizable architectural icons. When most people think of New York they think of Manhattan, but there are of course four other boroughs in the city, each made up of countless distinct neighborhoods. The relentless pace of New York life means no neighborhood maintains its identity for too long -- you won't find many Italians in Little Italy these days. Watch Candace Bushnell take My City_My Life on a tour of New York. » . It also means that the latest ""in"" place will soon be ""out"", giving way to the newest up-and-coming neighborhood known by a suitably convoluted acronym -- whether its Soho (South of the Hudson), Tribeca (Triangle Below Canal Street), Sobro (South Bronx) or Dumbo (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass). While Manhattan is still the beating heart of the city, rents there are beyond the reach of most New Yorkers, and the relentless tide of gentrification has flowed into the other boroughs. Where New York was once known for its mean streets, mayors Giuliani and Bloomberg have cleaned up the city with their zero-tolerance approach to crime. The city's murder rate is now a quarter that of the early 1990s, the height of New York's crack epidemic. While no one would complain about that, some feel that recent noise laws and bans on smoking indoors and serving trans fats in restaurants are signs that the city is losing the edginess on which it always thrived. The last century may have belonged to New York, but the world is changing. London is staking a claim as the world's financial capital, with Singapore and Hong Kong close behind. And while the Big Apple practically invented the idea of ""cool,"" cities like Berlin and Moscow are building a reputation as hipper, grittier alternatives, where the real underground action happens. But New Yorkers love competition. They're the reason the city bounced back from 9/11, the Great Depression and various Wall Street crises. They put up with the noise, crowds and the astronomical rents because they know there's nowhere on Earth that can match New York for sheer excitement. It's still the city where anything is possible and, for hopeful dreamers around the world, it's still the Promised Land, where anyone can be anything they want.","New York City is frenetic and glamorous, the quintessential metropolis .

"Los Angeles Film Festival (June 18 -- 28) Since the Oscars are a closed shop to the general public, turning up in L.A. for the biggest night in the movie calendar -- unless you happen to be on the guest list -- is pretty much a non-starter. Don't miss the Mr and Mrs Muscle Beach competition on Venice Beach . If you're a film buff much better instead to hit town for the annual film festival, where you can delight at over 100 features, as well as star-studded premieres, seminars with industry bigwigs and outdoor screenings. Mr and Mrs Muscle Beach Competition (July 4) It may not seem the obvious way to celebrate America's emancipation from British colonial rule, but the annual Independence Day competition on Venice Beach is definitely a spectacle, and a unique slice of Americana to boot. Now in its 75th year, the event features bikini-clad women contestants as well as a plethora of Arnie Schwarzenegger wannabes all hoping to be crowned the golden couple of muscle. The Long Beach Jazz Festival (August 7 -- 9) What nicer way to enjoy a warm summer evening in the city than with the crash of the Pacific sounding on one side and melodious jazz on the other.

"(CNN) -- Ten years ago, NBC, eager to come up with its own version of the unexpected CBS reality hit, the competition series ""Survivor,"" adapted a Dutch series called ""Now or Neverland"" and proudly presented it -- with pro-wrestling-style fanfare -- as its newest series: ""Fear Factor."" Monday night, NBC revived ""Fear Factor"" in a version best described as ""new and unimproved."" The show, which has contestants do disgusting things, is alarmingly gross, no question. But should we worry that its return marks a new and deeper descent into depravity for American TV-watchers? A jump-off into a new binge of revolting reality-show programming? Never fear. There are other factors at play. For one thing, the show's earlier version had raised the bar very high for disgusting. We've already gone there. More important, it's NBC. Only at NBC, where audience levels are well below every broadcast network, save Univision and the CW, would it be considered progress to reach back to a decade-old TV series -- and a horrible one, at that. Then again, NBC is the network that in its most recent attempts to revive old TV series, looked over the entire history of broadcast television and opted to present new versions of ... ""The Bionic Woman"" and ""Knight Rider."" ""Fear Factor"" is a known entity -- not a good one, but a known one -- and that makes it easier to promote than a series created from scratch. And ""Fear Factor,"" like any reality competition show, is the type of program that can be plugged into any airtime hole, in any order, and it'll get more viewers than whatever it's replacing. For many, even seeing someone smothering on scorpions or immersed in blood (as in its premiere Monday night) beats watching ""The Playboy Club."" It didn't have to be, of course. There were other new NBC shows from 2001 that could have been brought back instead. ""The Weakest Link,"" a quiz show based on another series from abroad, premiered that year. So did ""Kristin,"" a sitcom starring Kristin Chenoweth, which I'll bet not even she remembers clearly. And ""Emeril""-- the sitcom, not the cooking show. So to be fair, NBC's current management doesn't exactly have a lock on developing bad TV. But each of those bottom-of-the-barrel NBC shows from a decade ago -- and sadly, as a TV critic, I saw and recall them all -- was better than ""Fear Factor."" Then and now. I'd say that ""Fear Factor,"" as a programming strategy for the fourth-ranked broadcast network, has an air of desperation. Except that the air is a lot more foul than that. It smells, in fact, a lot like cow's blood. In Monday's two-hour 2011 revival premiere, returning host Joe Rogan (how proud he must be, to land that job twice) explained to the four pairs of contestants that one of their tasks was to climb inside a tank filled with ""3,000 gallons of cow's blood,"" submerge themselves to locate cow's hearts lying on the bottom of the tank and place them in the mouth of their partners, whose job was to spit them into smaller containers next to the giant tank. Cow's blood. Cow's hearts. Udderly revolting. There were other tasks, too, such as chewing and eating live scorpions, which made some of the contestants gag. At home, I wasn't far behind. The stunts on ""Fear Factor,"" Rogan said helpfully at the start of each hour, were designed and supervised by trained professionals. ""They should not be attempted,"" he added, ""by anyone, anywhere, anytime."" If you're watching ""Fear Factor"" to begin with, you just might need that warning. (And if you need it, you probably aren't bright enough to heed it.) I'm a TV-viewing professional. Here's my warning: "" 'Fear Factor' should not be viewed by anyone, anywhere, anytime."" The real shame of it is, NBC has some really good programming coming up early next year, starting with the musical drama ""Smash"" and the psychological thriller ""Awake."" Preceding those with ""Fear Factor"" not only sends the wrong message, it gathers the wrong audience. If NBC wants stupid, ""Fear Factor"" is the perfect smelly bait. It's also, amazingly, the modern equivalent of ""The Magic Christian,"" the 1969 Terry Southern parody film starring Peter Sellers as Guy Grand, a wealthy man who spent a fortune proving that people would do anything for money. In that film's climax, Guy filled a giant outdoor vat with animal waste -- blood, urine, feces -- and floated money on top of it, daring people to wade in and grab the cash. And they did, to the tune of Thunderclap Newman's ""Something in the Air."" All these years later, ""Fear Factor"" and NBC have made that ridiculous image come true: people wading in animal waste in exchange for cash. How offal. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Bianculli.","David Bianculli: NBC's ""Fear Factor"" redux is even more disgusting .
It's not a new wave of gross-out shows, Bianculli says; it's a desperate NBC .
Network is relaunching known entity because it's easier to promote, he says .
Bianculli's advice: ""Fear Factor"" shouldn't be viewed by anyone, anytime ."
