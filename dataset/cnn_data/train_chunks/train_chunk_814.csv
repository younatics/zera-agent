"By . James Rush . Tulisa Contostavlos (pictured arriving at court today) appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court today where she faces a charge of assault . Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos punched a celebrity blogger who she claimed was stalking her in an 'out-of-control' attack at the V Festival, a court heard. The 25-year-old pop star is said to have hit showbiz blogger Savvas Morgan in the face at the event in Chelmsford, Essex. Contostavlos appeared under her real name, Tula Contostavlos, at Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court this morning where she faces a charge of assault. The court heard Contostavlos, who pleaded not guilty to the charge at an earlier hearing, rowed with Mr Morgan at the close of the festival last summer. It emerged during the proceedings there was a long history of tension between the two after Mr Morgan used his website to publish a sex tape involving the singer. Contostavlos sat in the centre of the court alongside her personal assistant Gareth Varey, 28, from London, who has pleaded not guilty to harassment of Mr Morgan. The court heard during a heated confrontation before the alleged assault, she told the celebrity blogger she was 'worth £10m pounds' and that she knew 'gangsters and people from the streets' as they clashed in the early hours of the morning on August 18 last year. Contostavlos, her entourage and Mr Morgan - who runs a celeb website - were walking towards the VIP camping area when the alleged assault happened at about 12.30am. Taking to the stand to give evidence today Mr Morgan said Tulisa was 'behaving very aggressively' in the moments before the incident. Mr Morgan said: 'Tulisa pushed Gareth away and told him not to get involved. She said ""I will handle this"". The arguing went 'back and forth' in the moments before Contostavlos is said to have struck. Mr Morgan added: 'Gareth tried to hit me and then someone pulled him away. I turned and he was on the floor. I don’t know what happened and then as I looked, there was more and more people running towards me and just coming at me and then she hit me.' Matthew McNiff, prosecuting, said: 'Who is ""she?""' Mr Morgan answered: 'Tulisa Contostavlos.' The court heard Contostavlos, who pleaded not guilty to the charge at an earlier hearing, rowed with Mr Morgan at the close of the festival last summer . When asked 'where were you hit?' Mr Morgan used his hand to point to his left eye socket. Mr Morgan said she hit him in the face after 'swinging both arms' towards him. A friend of Tulisa’s, Jaqueline Moore, then ran towards the melee but slipped and was knocked unconscious in the fall, distracting Contostavlos and her 'entourage', the court heard. Mr Morgan told the court the alleged attack left him with a 'puffy, swollen eye' and he contacted police to report the incident. Mr Morgan told the court three newspapers had contacted him for information about the story but he denied accusations that he was trying the profit from the drama. He said in the build-up the one-time N-Dubz member was, 'was just being really aggressive and saying ""this is the end of the journey"", ""stop following me"", ""stop stalking me"". 'I just remember her repeatedly saying ""this is the end of the journey"". Contostavlos is said to have punched showbiz blogger Savvas Morgan (pictured, left, arriving at court today) in the face at the festival in Chelmsford, Essex . 'She was saying it aggressively. I told her ""I am not coming with you, I have no intention of coming with you, I am not trying to get on your tour bus"",' he added. Mr Morgan, who says he is friends with various pop stars including Rita Ora and X Factor contestant Misha B, said before the alleged attack there had been tensions throughout the day at the festival. He said: 'There was just general whispering by both of the accused. It made me feel uncomfortable throughout the day.' Contostavlos sat in the centre of the court alongside her personal assistant Gareth Varey (left) who has pleaded not guilty to harassment of Mr Morgan . The pair first saw each other in the . Mahiki nightclub tent during the afternoon and then saw each other in . and around the festival throughout the day although there was no direct . conversation until the alleged attack, the court heard. The court heard that Contostavlos asked for security staff to eject Mr Morgan from the tent, leaving him 'embarrassed' according to a text he sent to a friend. Mr Morgan was accused by Jeremy Dein QC of 'stalking' the one-time X Factor star and 'manipulating the facts' of the case and 'making up' evidence. The court heard Mr Morgan had been responsible for republishing footage of a sex tape involving Contostavlos leading to hundreds of comments on his website which attracted around 150,000 followers in 2012. His website featured comments from commentators saying 'thoroughly obnoxious and defamatory' insults towards Contostavlos but Mr Morgan said he was originally unaware of the abusive comments. He claimed the video was removed from his website four hours after it had been posted, but the court heard he was the recipient of a High Court order banning him from publishing the footage. He said: 'I simply directed people to the website where I got it from.' He added: 'It was nothing personal against Tulisa.' Mr McNiff said Contostavlos's defence was that she had been careful to keep her arms behind her back, and someone else assaulted Mr Morgan. Mr Morgan said he had never been accused of stalking anyone else in the business. Beyonce had been headlining the V Festival at Hylands Park, Chelmsford, on Sunday, August 18, 2013, prior to when the alleged incident occurred . The singer, who gave the same London address as Varey to the court, faces up to six months in prison if found guilty at the end of the trial which is listed for three days. Moore, 39, from Manchester, admitted being involved in the incident. Before the start of the trial today she pleaded guilty to a public order offence and was hit with a £130 fine and ordered to pay costs of £450 and a victim surcharge of £20. The case against Contostavlos and Varey continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Tulisa Contostavlos said to have punched showbiz blogger Savvas Morgan .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . San Fransisco-based Joe Veix, 26, joined Tinder as a dog because, as a journalist, he was mildly interested to see how other users would interact with him as a non-human. Tinder, the hugely successful dating app whereby users are matched simply by swiping through profile photos of people nearby and skipping or approving potential suitors, is known for its unique approach; convenient at best and shallow at worst. Joining initially as a male golden retriever called Hero and receiving a series of vapid and predictable 'matches' who were clearly very bored, the game changed when Mr Veix switched his gender to female. Boy meets girl: Journalist Joe Veix joined dating app Tinder to see how well he would do posing as a 26-year-old - in dog years - golden retriever called Hero (pictured) Mr Veix, who wrote about the experiment for DeathAndTaxes.com, 'approved' every profile he swiped past throughout the test, and received 206 matches in the space of a week as a male dog. Then, re-entering the cluttered digital dating pool as a female dog, he was surprised to be bombarded with 300 male matches in a mere two hours - at 9.30am on a dreary weekday morning no less. And while the University of Rochester recently conducted a study which revealed that men are 40 per cent more likely to email a woman than the other way around, no one expected this statistic to hold strong cross-species. In character: It started off harmlessly enough when Mr Veix was pretending to be a male dog, female Tinder users like Lizze (pictured) with arguably a little too much time on their hands willingly playing along . Canine loving: Golden retrievers are undeniably handsome dogs, certainly so for 'swimmer, traveler and engineer' Stephanie (pictured) 'There were too many matches to keep up,' writes Mr Veix, who tells MailOnline he has tried online dating as himself a few times, but not 'seriously'. 'It became difficult to swipe right at a steady pace, because the “It’s a Match!” screen animation would play after every profile and slow me down.' Bizarrely, a large number of the chats he received as female dog were 'immediately' sexual he notes. Things take a turn: When Mr Veix switched from being a male to a female dog, his profile was suddenly flooded with eager, and often aggressive, male Tinder users like Curtis (pictured) Frequent deeply un-original references to 'doggy style' flooded in. One man, a 31-year-old Wall Street worker (according to his profile) took the time to construct a series of well-worded advances. 'I'd  donate a kidney and two from my annoying coworker just to take you on a long hike around Fort Funston,' he writes. 'I'll bring the tennis ball. Deal?' Several were aggressive or downright rude. Curtis, 23, for example, whose captivating profile summary was: 'Hi how you al doin let me know let me think [sic]', opened his line of communication with the simple phrase, 'Shut up b**ch.' Steady on: Worryingly, many of the men were entirely unperturbed by the fact they were addressing a dog - so long as she was female, she was a sufficient target for lewd remarks . Scary: For Hero the female dog, Mr Veix writes 'there were too many matches to keep up', from fine gentleman such as Rovert (pictured) who appears to have something of an anger problem . Another somewhat concerning character, whose profile puzzlingly reads: 'I won't freak out if you don't reply back immediately', messaged the canine with: 'Yeah that's right ya mutt bring me the remote' and 'Stop your f**kin barking or the shock collar is coming on [sic].' And 25-year-old Jon, whose only biographical snippet of information is that he stands at 6 ft 1 tall, offered: 'Oh Hero, if only I weren't all alone and you were a real woman... We're so compatible!' before continuing with, 'Maybe you can try? To be real? For me?' These responses were in sharp contrast to the messages he received as a male dog, which were far more light-hearted. Dashing: This Wall Street trader might even be an appealing candidate, but for the fact that he is willingly engaging in a well-worded exchange with a fictional female dog . And then there's plain desperate: Sergio (pictured) was locked in menial conversation with Hero the dog for over an hour, according to Mr Veix, who quickly got fed up and deleted the app . Lizze, 22, joined in the game and engaged in a series of 'woof woof' and '*wags tail*' type exchanges. Stephanie, also 22, flirted using cat emojis, and another spent over an hour chatting inanely and submitting gems such as: '1 bark means yes and 2 barks mean no?' Mildly amused by playing a male, and quickly fed up of experiencing a taste of the dog-eat-dog world of being a female on Tinder - fictional or otherwise - Mr Veix deleted the app, which claims to match over five million people worldwide every day. 'It does . seem like female users have to experience an unfair amount of . objectification and casual misogyny' 'I got sick of my phone being overloaded with Tinder notifications and awful messages. Even if you’re a dog, online dating is terrible,' he concludes. When we asked Mr Veix what he deduced from his ill-fated experiment, he said: 'I'm hesitant to derive too much meaning from . pretending to be a golden retriever on a dating site, though it does . seem like female users have to experience an unfair amount of . objectification and casual misogyny simply by logging in. 'It's not . necessarily the fault of dating sites, but perhaps a reflection of some . ugly aspects of our culture that I hope we can improve upon.'","Joe Veix, 26, was surprised by how his 'matches' changed when he switched from being a male to a female dog .

"By . John Drayton . Peter Scudamore’s position as Premier League chief executive took a severe blow after sexist emails sent from his account were described as ‘unacceptable’ by Prime Minister David Cameron. Scudamore has been under fire for the past week following the publication of sexist emails sent from his Premier League account. The Premier League was on Sunday forced to defend its working environment after the woman who blew the whistle on Scudamore said she was 'humiliated, belittled and disgusted' when reading the messages. Expressing his view: Prime Minister David Cameron has described sexist emails sent by Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore as 'unacceptable' Feeling the heat: Scudamore has been under fire following the publication of sexist emails sent from his Premier League account . A Downing . Street spokesman said Prime Minister David Cameron shared the view . expressed by sports minister Helen Grant that Scudamore's comments were . ‘unacceptable’ but that it was for the Premier League to decide on his . future. The . Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'Helen Grant ... was right to . say what she did, I have clearly associated the Prime Minister directly . with those remarks. 'But in terms of staffing decisions at the Premier League, it's for the Premier League.' A . Premier League statement said: 'We do not recognise this . characterisation of the working environment at the Premier League, nor . do we believe that it can be supported by the facts. 'The . chief executive has already apologised for any offence caused and a . proper review of all the evidence is now under way within the Premier . League's established and rigorous procedures. 'This . process is not yet concluded and it is therefore not possible to offer . comments in detail at this stage. However we will make a further . statement in due course. 'The Premier League continues to be fully committed to treating all staff fairly and on merit, regardless of gender.' Important role: Scudamore presented Man City players with their Premier League winners' medals . The emails referred to women in a derogatory terms, contained sexual innuendos, and made jokes about 'female irrationality'. The . Football Association's independent board member Heather Rabbatts, who . will chair a meeting of its inclusion advisory board to discuss the case . on Tuesday, has also issued a statement saying Scudamore should . consider his position in light of 'growing evidence of a closed culture . of sexism' at the Premier League. Abraham said she felt she had a duty to speak out about the contents of emails between her boss and his lawyer friend. 'Mr Scudamore has a huge amount of influence and is paid a vast sum of money and has behaved wrongly,' she said. 'Having . witnessed that I felt I had a duty to speak out. If I didn't then I'd . somehow be condoning his behaviour - just like the other people who saw . those messages. Pressure: Heather Rabbatts believes Scudamore should consider his position at the Premier League . 'Despite . what some people have said since the Sunday Mirror printed the story . last week, this is not the sort of thing that goes on in offices these . days. 'And . for those people who've attacked me for saying they were just 'jokes' I . wonder how they would feel if their wife or girlfriend or daughter had . to read messages like that. 'And how would they feel if those messages were written about their wife or girlfriend or daughter?' 'We've heard of casual racism and I think there's a lot of casual sexism in the game.' Sponsor . Barclays has expressed also its disappointment to the league, which has . raised the stakes ahead of Monday's meeting of the league's audit and . remuneration committee, chaired by Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck. Buck . is a friend and shooting partner of Scudamore's, but the committee only . has the power to make a recommendation and consists of four members, . the others being Manchester United director David Gill, Stoke chairman .

"By . Leon Watson . A convicted rogue trader's bizarre attempt to evade justice has ended after he walked across to the French border to face jail. After a legal saga that captured the national imagination, a pilgrimage to the Pope and a plea for presidential clemency, the former Societe Generale trader Jerome Kerviel finally handed himself in. For weeks, Kerviel had been . marching to Paris from Rome where he met the Pope earlier this year, in . protest 'against the tyranny of financial markets'. Journalists surround convicted rogue trader Jerome Kerviel (left) as he arrives on the Franco-Italian border in Menton . Kerviel, assisted by priest Patrice Gourrier (left), surrenders to police at the French border . Kerviel (centre) enters a car as he is being put under arrest by French plainclothed policemen . He had been followed . by a crowd of reporters and live television crews. But last night he was shown in footage broadcast on French television crossing the border from Italy to France by foot. A police official in the French border town of Menton said Kerviel was in custody in a local precinct just after a midnight deadline to begin serving his sentence. It was not immediately clear when or where he would be taken to prison. Kerviel cost Societe Generale 4.9 billion euros ($6.4bn; £4bn)  in losses in 2008, rocking the banking world just before the financial market meltdown. He argued that the bank had quietly welcomed his unauthorised trades when they made money, but turned against him when his trades turned sour. Kerviel, who has spent two months walking from Rome to protest his treatment by the courts, resumed his march toward France where he he was arrested shortly before the midnight deadline at which he had to check into a French police station . A police official in the French border town of Menton said Kerviel was in custody in a local precinct just after a midnight deadline to begin serving his sentence . Kerviel gained nationwide supporters and turned himself into a crusader against a corrupt financial world . French judges found Kerviel guilty . anyway. He was sentenced to three years in prison in a 2010 verdict that . was upheld recently by France's highest court. But he gained nationwide supporters and turned himself into a crusader against a corrupt financial world. 'The fight will continue regardless of what happens,' he told journalists while walking toward the border on Sunday night. Kerviel, pictured here in the middle of a walk from Rome to Paris, was convicted in 2010 of carrying the record trading fraud . The French rogue trader on a pilgrimage to meet the Pope . Before the deadline to begin serving . his sentence, Kerviel traveled to Italy to meet the pope and on Saturday . appealed to French President Francois Hollande to intervene. Hollande's . office said it would consider a specific request for mercy 'according . to the usual procedure.' But Finance Minister Michel Sapin described Kerviel on Sunday as a criminal. 'The . crook is caught, the crook is convicted, the crook should of course . serve his sentence,' Sapin said Sunday on LCI television. Jerome Kerviel, seen here in October 2012, has not made a statement about the verdict . Kerviel's lawyer Patrice Spinosi talks to the press the Paris' court at the end of the appeal . An internal report by Societe Generale found that managers failed to follow up on 74 different alarms about Kerviel's activities. A few executives resigned, and Kerviel's superiors were questioned, but none faced charges. In March, France's highest appeal court upheld his three-year jail term. But it quashed 4.9 billion euros in civil damages that judges had ordered Kerviel to pay to compensate SocGen for its losses when the bank unwound the trader's positions in the midst of the financial crisis. Over the weekend, Kerviel appealed to French President Francois Hollande to give immunity to unnamed witnesses he said would be willing to testify in his favour. He claimed he was not guilty and that his criminal conviction was unfair. The French president's office has only replied that if Kerviel asked for presidential grace, his request would be examined according to usual procedures. Kerviel rejected that offer, saying it would imply an admission of guilt on his part. In an emailed statement on Saturday, a spokesman for Societe Generale criticized the media hype around Kerviel. He said Kerviel had been the subject of a meticulous investigation, judged three times and found guilty each time.","Legal saga around Jerome Kerviel captured French national imagination .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A Colombian drugs lord let a cocaine mule with a kilogram of contraband in his stomach die - before cutting out the packet and selling it on, police say. The body of a well-connected young lawyer was discovered in a forest near Malaga, Spain, in August 2010. The man was found without clothing, wrapped in clingfilm and with a cut in his abdomen. A handout photo from Guardia Civil shows what appears to be an X-ray of the mule with packages still in his stomach. He had ingested almost a kilogram of drugs in numerous packages, officers say . Now, four years later, the Spanish Civil Guard have announced they discovered what happened to the man - known in reports as J.A.U.I. The man, a Colombian national with Spanish citizenship, was hired by a drug lord - known as J.A.V.H in records - to bring a packet of cocaine from South America to Spain. J.A.U.I made it from Colombia to Chile and eventually to Spain - but by the time he landed, he was suffering from terrible pains in his stomach, officers said. It is thought the pain was caused by several bags of cocaine - thought to weigh up to a kilogram - in his intestines. Clearly not too interested in his mule's welfare, J.AV.H. just waited for him to die, The Local reports. Pictured: Some of the cocaine thought to have been smuggled from Colombia to Spain by the mule - a well-connected lawyer. A drug dealer has been arrested by Spanish authorities following the 2010 death . An autopsy showed that J.A.U.I was given painkillers as he was dying, however. After the man died, the drug lord cut out his contraband - removing it through his stomach.It is thought J.A.V.H then sold on the drugs. A later forensic examination concluded the lawyer died from intestinal obstruction. It added a package was removed via a cut in the man's stomach  - which was later stitched up with fishing line. Spanish police have now arrested the drug lord - who is now awaiting punishment. It is thought he had several identities, addresses and security personnel.","Well connected lawyer found dead in a forest in Malaga, Spain in 2010 .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Midwife Jeanette Matthews faces a series of charges relating to alleged misconduct and lack of competence . A pregnant woman was told to ‘hurry up’ and have her baby by a midwife who was desperate to get home after ordering a takeaway curry, a tribunal heard. Jeanette Matthews allegedly threatened the expectant mother at Airedale General Hospital in Keighley, West Yorkshire, by saying: ‘If you don’t hurry up and have the baby I’m going to cut you’. The midwife also told the patient that the labour ward was short staffed and that she did not want to be there, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) heard. The details have emerged after the expectant mother, known only as ‘Patient A’, made a complaint against Matthews, who was the midwife assigned to her on the hospital’s labour ward in February 2011. Matthews faces a series of charges relating to alleged misconduct and lack of competence at the NMC tribunal in central London which she has chosen not to attend. Greg Unwin, for the NMC, said Matthews, who qualified as a nurse in 1987 and as a midwife in 2002, was first investigated after ‘Patient A’ complained about her conduct. He said:  ‘Patient A was admitted to Airedale General Hospital on the 19 February and delivered her baby during the night shift of the early hours of the 20 February. ‘The registrant was her allocated midwife. ‘It is said that the registrant was rude in her conduct, that she inappropriately asked Patient A to stop using pain relief and that she had the patient in the lithotomy position, which is when the mother’s legs are placed in stirrups without providing any proper explanation or obtaining any consent.’ As a result of the complaint, the matter was investigated by Ms Sarah Bennett - an investigating supervisor of midwives. Mr Unwin added: ‘Ms Bennett interviewed the registrant about the incident and the registrant denied that she had told the patient to stop using her pain relief. ‘She did admit that on occasion she would sometimes say to mothers that she might have to give them a little cut in order to encourage them to push harder.’ Jeanette Matthews allegedly threatened the expectant mother at Airedale General Hospital in Keighley, West Yorkshire (pictured) in February 2011, by saying: 'If you don't hurry up and have the baby I'm going to cut you' Matthews also claimed she had obtained proper consent before putting the patient into the lithotomy position, the panel heard. Following the complaint, she was placed on a supervised programme of practise at St James’ Hospital, Leeds, when it is said she failed to demonstrate competence as a midwife. On June 6 2012, she failed to react when a patient who had recently given birth started haemorrhaging, the panel heard. ‘When that occurs it requires immediate response to minimise the blood loss to the mother,’ said Mr Unwin. ‘The registrant showed no indication that she was concerned about the risk of blood loss.’ On a second supervised shift on 27 June of the same year, Matthews failed to make proper records for a young, first time mother for two hours, it is said. She was suspended from the hospital and practise as a midwife following an interview on 3 July 2012. If the panel find the allegations against her to be true, she could face a period of suspension or being struck off the register. The hearing continues.

"By . James Rush . A woman whose husband is dying of cancer was told by a holiday company to 'take someone else with you' when she tried to cancel their Spanish anniversary holiday. Chris Quick, 58, and her husband Keith, 61, of Southsea, had booked and paid for a trip to Benidorm next month to celebrate their 38th wedding anniversary. They were also looking forward to another trip in October to the Spanish resort, where they have friends. Chris Quick (pictured on a previous holiday with her husband Keith) was told by a holiday company 'to take someone else with you' when she tried to cancel two holidays after her husband was diagnosed with lung cancer . But when Mr Quick went to the GP about a persistent cough, the couple were given the devastating news he had lung cancer. Last week they were told it is terminal and they told travel operator Thomson's Hilsea branch that the two Benidorm breaks would have to be scrapped. The company warned however that not all of the money would be refunded and suggested Mrs Quick should find another travel companion. Mr Quick said ‘I’m so disgusted we have been treated this way. 'I never expected to get cancer, yet this isn’t an exceptional circumstance for them. 'All of this has been so emotional and hasn’t helped at all. 'I wanted to say goodbye to my friends one last time, and I won’t be able to.' Mrs Quick, who worked at a women’s refuge before she retired, said: 'We go out to Benidorm about four times a year every year to see our friends out there. 'I am so angry about this. It’s not about the money as we are sorting it with our insurance. The couple were given the devastating news that Mr Quick had lung cancer after he went to the GP about a persistent cough . 'I want an apology for the way we have been spoken to. This has been a very emotional time for us. 'When we got given this terrible news I told my daughter to ring Thomson to cancel the holiday for us.' Their daughter Kerry Holt, 36, called Thomson with the news and was warned that not all the money would be refunded. She said 'The attitude of the person on the phone was appalling - I was told to ""shut up"" at one point. 'There was no empathy to my dad’s situation. He didn’t want this to happen. 'Mum and dad have used Thomson for the past four years and thought they would show more compassion. Mrs Quick said the couple (pictured on a previous holiday to Benidorm) go out to the destination about four times a year every year to see friends . The couple had booked and paid for a trip to Benidorm next month to celebrate their 38th wedding anniversary (file picture) 'Instead they suggested my mum should go on holiday with someone else.' Thomson have so far paid back £538 for the holiday in June, which cost £1,900. Refunds for the October holiday have still not been sorted out. According to Thomson's website, customers who have travel insurance with Thomson Insurance may be covered if they were unaware they had a condition at the time of booking. The company does say however the insurance does not cover those who knew there was a possibility they may have to cancel. In more general circumstances, the Citizens Advice Bureau says under package holiday regulations, customers 'only have the right to cancel if your organiser has made major changes to your holiday.' It goes on to say: 'If your organiser hasn’t made any changes to your holiday your right to cancel will depend on the terms and conditions of your holiday contract. You may be able to cancel your holiday but your organiser might charge you a cancellation fee. 'You will normally be able to find information about your organiser’s cancellation policy in your holiday brochure or with your booking information'. A spokesman said: 'Thomson is very sorry to hear that Mr and Mrs Quick were unhappy with the service they received when cancelling their holiday. 'We sympathise with their situation and understand this must be a very difficult time. 'Our customer service and retail teams always aim to offer the best possible service to all customers and this includes providing them with details of all the options available to them. 'We would like to reassure the couple that we never intended to cause offence or undue upset by providing this information. 'As their holiday has now been cancelled we have advised Mr and Mrs Quick to contact their insurance provider to settle their claim.' In February this year, MailOnline reported on grandfather Bruce Crawcour who won a full refund from Thomson Holidays in a landmark case. Mr Crawcour, 66, launched his battle with parent company TUI Travel after he was forced to cancel a holiday when his wife Kay, 63, fell ill. Instead they charged him the full £2,256 for the two-week break the couple were due to have last May in Majorca at the luxury Protur Biomar Gran Hotel. But the retired civil servant managed to prove the company was not out of pocket after the flights and hotel room vanished from the Thomson website before the departure date. He argued this meant they had managed to sell the package on. In February, he became one of the first holidaymakers in the UK to be awarded damages from a tour operator for a cancelled holiday. The pensioner, who represented himself at Telford Small Claims Court, was awarded a full refund as well as £300 court costs. At the time it was reported the ruling could spell major changes for holidaymakers who follow suit and sue travel firms over cancellation clauses in package holiday contracts. Experts believed it may force tour operators to change their policies on late cancellation fees.","Chris and Keith Quick booked trip to Benidorm for wedding anniversary .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A family’s £500,000 dream home has been demolished after it breached planning rules by being built 6ft too high by bungling builders. The four-bedroom house, in East Dunbartonshire, Scotland, was flattened in just a day after it was built 6ft higher, 9ft longer and 4ft wider than originally applied for by car sales manager Andrew Murray and his wife Frances. Mr Murray, 51, paid £164,000 for the building plot and spent a further £300,000 building the ‘dream home’ despite not having a permit or approved planning permission. The four-bedroom house, in East Dunbartonshire, Scotland, was flattened in just a day after it was built 6ft higher, 9ft longer and 4ft wider than originally applied for by car sales manager Andrew Murray . The local council rejected Mr Murray's planning application because his house exceeded size guidelines . He splashed out on a fully-fitted . designer kitchen at a cost of £27,000 and spent £25,000 putting four . bathrooms into the property and hoped the council would grant planning . permission retrospectively. However, . East Dunbartonshire Council ruled the house had to be demolished for . breaching planning regulations and for not being in line with local plan . policy. Council planners said the property was built larger than the plans stated, had too many windows and an unapproved 13ft balcony. The original plans for the house also stated it was to be only two floors high, but an unapproved third floor was later added. Mr Murray, 51, paid £164,000 for the building plot and spent a further £300,000 building the ‘dream home’ (left) before council officials rejected planning permission for it and ordered for it to be demolished (right) Mr Murray, 51, splashed out on a fully-fitted designer kitchen at a cost of £27,000 and spent £25,000 putting four bathrooms into the property and hoped the council would grant planning permission retrospectively . Fences were erected around the house two weeks ago but the house was torn down today after a digger was brought in to flatten the building. Neighbour John Houston, 76, welcomed the demolition and said the ‘eyesore’ had blighted the area since it was put up. He added: ‘I’m so glad to see it gone. It was an absolute eyesore and blocked the sunlight getting into my house and my garden.

The council said the original plans for the house stated it was to be only two floors high, but an unapproved third floor was later added . Next-door neighbour John Houston, 76, welcomed the demolition and said the 'eyesore' had blighted the area since it was put up . ‘I woke up the other day and thought the bedroom light was on but it was just the sunlight coming in the window. ‘We haven’t had that for four or five years because it was blocked out by that building. ‘You would look out my windows at that side of the property and just see a wall which wasn’t good. ‘I have never seen the man who owned it anywhere near the house. ‘There is now a massive pile of rubble where the house was and I’ve been told that it has to stay there for three days before they start removing it and that will apparently take them into next week. ‘Nobody bothered about the neighbours when it was built and it has been empty ever since going up. ‘I’m delighted it’s gone and we can get things back to normal.’ Mr Murray, who currently lives with his wife, 53, and their family in Strathaven, Lanarkshire, was forced to pay £11,500 to have the property demolished. It has been claimed the family will now have to sell their current £350,000 home to meet their debts. Ahead of the demolition, Mr Murray said: 'It’s a disaster for us. We’ll be out on the street. 'I don’t blame the council. They have exhausted every other avenue.' Andrew Murray had to pay almost £12,000 to demolish his dream home, pictured, after the council denied planning permission . Mr Murray said that some of the interior fittings inside the property had been removed prior to its demolition and said it had been broken into and vandalised . The family blamed bungling builders for the incorrect measurements of the property, saying he left the project in the hands of architects and builders who ‘failed to follow the plans’. In a letter to planners at East Dunbartonshire Council, the father-of-three wrote that he had put ‘trust and faith in the professionalism of our friend who we understood to be a reputable builder who would oversee the project on our behalf.’ He added: ‘However, it is now evident we were too trustworthy and that we did not give the project the attention that we should have.’ Diane Campbell, East Dunbartonshire Council’s director of governance and regulation, said: ‘Formal enforcement was agreed in September 2013 and work to bring the house down has now begun.’ Thomas Glen, the council’s head of development and enterprise, said the house differed ‘considerably’ from the initial planning application. He said: 'The house as constructed differs considerably from a previously-approved scheme, is not in line with local plan policy and guidance, and raises considerable amenity and potential precedent issues.’ Mr Murray claims builders Textura and the architects told him the home would meet council regulations and planning consent would be given retrospectively. But in the two years it took for the house to be built, neither planning permission nor a building warrant was successfully obtained. Neighbour John Houston said: 'I'm so glad to see it gone. It was an absolute eyesore and blocked the sunlight getting into my house and my garden' Thomas Glen, the council's head of development and enterprise said: 'The house as constructed differs considerably from a previously-approved scheme' Ahead of the demolition, father-of-three Mr Murray said: 'It's a disaster for us. We'll be out on the street' The property also lacked an electricity supply, plumbing and a waste water system. The builders have since gone bankrupt and it is thought subcontractors were not paid and stripped out fixtures and fittings. The house was also broken into and vandalised before it was flattened. Mr Murray said: 'The whole thing has had a terrible effect on my family. It is a financial catastrophe. 'To invest all this money in a new home and lose it, and lose my old home because of the huge debts is beyond a nightmare. 'We were never rich. But we worked hard to attain what we thought was a comfortable position. All of that is gone now and we don’t know where to turn.' Mr Murray used Textura UK Ltd to build the house which used CRGP Ltd Architects and Surveyors to lodge the unsuccessful planning application with East Dunbartonshire Council. According to company records, the building firm Textura UK Ltd is in 'voluntary creditors' liquidation' and not able to comment. A spokesperson for the architect firm CRGP said: 'We cannot make any comment at this time.' Fences were put up around the property two weeks ago and the roof was carefully removed ahead of today's demolition . Mr Murray, who currently lives with his family in Strathaven, Lanarkshire, was forced to pay £11,500 to have the property razed to the ground . Council officials objected to the large balcony at the rear or the property and claimed if they allowed it to remain it would set a precedent .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A 'Shirley Valentine' ex-pat who lived on benefits in Britain is begging to move back to the UK with her Tunisian toyboy - because they are broke. Deborah Chniti, 43, from Stoke-on-Trent, was claiming disability living allowance when she emigrated to Tunisia in 2012 so she could marry Ala, 27, who she met on Facebook. But Mrs Chniti's plan to return to the UK has now been scuppered after her husband was denied a visa - because the couple do not have enough money. Deborah Chniti, 43, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, emigrated to . Tunisia in 2012 to marry her toyboy Ala, 27, pictured, but now wants to return to the UK with her husband because they . have run out of money . Mrs Chniti, who according to her Facebook page lives in Tunis, claims they are broke because she is too ill to work while her husband, who works as a labourer, earns just five pounds a day. Now the mother-of-three has said it is 'disgusting' that her huband's visa application has been turned down and they cannot move back to Britain together. She said: 'I’m missing out on my grandchildren growing up. I think it’s disgusting. The law has to change. The Government just want my money and letting all the wrong immigrants in.' Mrs Chniti moved to Tunisia in June 2012, two years after becoming friends with Ala on Facebook. She believed she could return with him to the UK - without him needing a visa - for up to four years after she left. But new rules were introduced by the Home Office in 2012, in a bid to stop immigrant spouses, who might not work once they arrive in Britain, relying on the taxpayer for money. Mrs Chniti was claiming disability living allowance when she lived in the UK and says she is still too unwell to work. Her husband works as a qualified labourer in Tunisia but gets paid £5 per day, she says . Rules now say Mrs Chniti - who says she cannot work because of a bad back, depression, anxiety and asthma - needs to earn . at least £18,600 a year or have savings of £62,500 before her husband can join her. People who have been married outside of the UK for more than four years are now no longer able to apply for the visa for their spouse. Mrs Chniti said: 'I gave my house up, lost my car and my kids and went to live with my daughter. Every single thing in the UK I owned is gone. I’ve got nothing now. 'I need to go home. I want to be with my children and grandchildren, but I can’t leave my husband. I’m an emotional wreck. No-one speaks English where we live. I’m stuck in the house all day. 'I can’t go to the shops because they don’t understand me as they don’t speak English, and that’s the only language I speak. People stare at me because I don’t dress like them, and women knock into me.' Mrs Chniti, left, says she cannot work because she has a bad back from three car crashes. She claims her husband, right, will 'work 24 hours a day to support' her if he is allowed into the UK . Ala Chniti is said to be working from 6am to 3pm each day and Mrs Chniti says they cannot possibly start to save up on what they are collectively earning . Mrs Chniti, left, said her husband 'doesn't want a penny' from the Government but she does not have the required salary or savings needed for him to obtain a visa . She added: 'It’s unfair for us to be apart when we have lived together for two years. Why does money have to stop us having a normal life? He’s a qualified labourer. 'He doesn’t want a penny from the Government. He said he will work 24 hours a day to support me if it comes to that. I can’t work because I have a bad back from three car crashes and will need a knee replacement operation when I am 70. 'I can’t walk long distances and can’t sit or stand for a long time. I also have asthma and have suffered with depression, stress and anxiety since I was 21. The mother-of-three left Stoke-on-Trent in 2012 but says she now needs . to earn £18,600 a year - or have £62,500 in savings - before her young . husband can return to the UK with her . 'My husband works from 6am to 3pm and gets the equivalent of five pound a day. We can’t save on that.' Mrs Chniti said she missed the birth of her fourth grandchild last Thursday, and has never seen her third grandchild. Her eldest daughter Laura Hughes, 22, said: 'I miss my mum, I just want her back. It’s been really stressful because we just want to be a proper family again.' The couple have lived in Tunisia for four years and claim they are . living below the poverty line. According to her Facebook, the couple . live in Tunis, pictured above . The Home Office brought in 'family rules' in July 2012 to ensure spouses coming to the UK do not become reliant on the taxpayer for financial support. Any British citizen who wants to sponsor their non-European spouse's visa must be able to show they will have a guaranteed job paying at least £18,600 a year, which will start within three months of returning to the UK. They must also show they have been earning the equivalent to £18,600 in the past six months. If they are not earning that salary each year, the British citizen must prove they have £62,500 in savings. Stoke-on-Trent South Labour MP Rob Flello who has written to the Home Office about the issue. He said: 'We are dealing with this case. I sympathise with Mrs Chniti and have been in contact with the Home Office to try to find a solution.' But a Home Office spokesman said: 'We welcome those who wish to make a life in the UK with their family, work hard and make a contribution, but it must not be at the taxpayers’ expense. 'Our family rules were brought in to make sure that spouses coming to the UK do not become reliant on the taxpayer for financial support, and are well enough supported to integrate effectively. 'This is fair to applicants and to the rest of the public.'","Deborah Chniti, 43, moved from Stoke-on-Trent to Tunisia in 2012 to marry .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A man has told how a mugger attacked him from behind as he laid flowers on his parents' grave. Terence Boyle, 68, was grabbed by the neck, punched and wrestled to the ground by a man who ambushed him as he visited his parents' grave on the anniversary of his mother's death. The retired factory worker, from Gorton, Manchester, needed a CAT scan to check for bleeding on the brain after he was attacked at Gorton cemetery on Saturday lunchtime. Terence Boyle, 68, was tending his parents' grave when he was attacked from behind by a mugger . Mr Boyle had been in the graveyard for an hour, tending the graves of his mother, Norah, and father, John, when he was attacked by a man who police believe had lain in wait for him. He fought back, but the mugger punched him in the face twice before escaping with his wallet, which contained £140 cash. Mr Boyle, who suffers from atrial fibrillation, which means he has an irregular heartbeat, called his brother for help on his mobile phone and was found leaning against a headstone suffering with severe shock and a cut to his mouth. The bachelor, who visits his parents' graves regularly, escaped serious injury but was rushed to hospital for brain scan. He said: 'I was tending to my parents' graves and was just about to leave when I felt a hand on my collar and a hand in my back pocket. 'I swung round and grabbed hold of the individual and there was a struggle and I fell to the ground.' He said the 'scruffy looking' man punched him in the face twice, knocking off his glasses, before fleeing. Mr Boyle regularly visits the grave of his parents Norah and John Boyle, pictured at a family wedding in 1990 . Mr Boyle was rushed to hospital for a CAT scan to check for bleeding on the brain after he was assaulted . Mr Boyle said: 'My glasses had gone and I was dazed.  There was nothing I could do - I felt helpless.' He added: 'My mum died of heart disease 19 years ago and I used to come here with my dad before he died and we used to sit on the bench and knock our thoughts about. 'On the day of the attack I went to reflect on our life together - now this day is just a bad memory. 'My mum would have been heartbroken' Mr Boyle's mother died in May 1995 from heart disease at the age of 85, while his father, John, died in 2001, aged 89. The mugger is described as white, of stocky build, and aged between 35 and 40. He was about 5ft 8in tall with short brown hair and was wearing blue stonewash jeans and a navy jumper. Detective Constable Michael O’Connor of Greater Manchester Police said: 'To attack a man at a graveside is an appalling act of cowardice and the actions of the person responsible smack of absolute desperation. 'This man needs to be caught and brought to justice.'","Terence Boyle, 68, was ambushed on Saturday as he tended parents' grave .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . European migrants should be restricted from working in the EU, according to almost three-quarters of MailOnline readers. More than 40,000 people took part in a major survey to gauge public opinion on key issues including the EU, immigration, tax, crime and gay marriage ahead of European elections this week. It reveals 44 per cent want Britain to leave the EU while 40 per cent disagree with the idea of severing ties with Brussels. Scroll down to see video . 72 per cent of MailOnline readers who took part in the survey say migrants should be restricted from working in the UK . MailOnline readers are split 44-40 on whether the UK should remain in the European Union . A majority of the 40,000 people who took part in the survey say that resources should not be distributed across the EU from rich to poorer countries . Some 48 per cent of those surveyed said that overall EU membership has been a 'bad thing' for the UK . More than 9 in 10 people said immigrants must adapt to the values and culture of the United Kingdom, with just 4 per cent of people disgareeing . The EUvox quiz was launched by a collaboration of leading academic institutes and NatCen Social Research on 22nd April and completed by 40,000 people through MailOnline. Analysis of the data reveals what MailOnline readers really think of Europe, as political parties slug it out in the final days of campaigning before polls open on Thursday morning. The question of whether Britain should remain in the European Union has been central to much of the debate, with Ukip wanting to pull out altogether and the Tories promising an in-out referendum by 2017 after clawing back some powers. Overall 23 per cent of MailOnline ‘completely disagree’ that the UK should remain part of the EU, while another 22 per cent ‘disagree’. By contrast 11 per cent completely agreed Britain should remain, with another 28 per cent saying they also agreed, while 16 per cent said they neither agreed nor disagreed. Almost half – 48 per cent – agreed that ‘overall, EU membership has been a bad thing for the United Kingdom’. Just one in five – 21 per cent – thought the EU should ‘redistribute resources from richer to poorer countries’, with 63 per cent disagreeing. Giving gay couples the same rights as heterosexual couples to marry is backed by 57 per cent of MailOnline readers surveyed . On tax, most people said it was wrong to redistribute wealth from the richest people to the poorest, with only 27 per cent of people agreeing . 44 per cent of people want to see the top rate of tax - currently 45p - to be reduced, with 39 per cent of people disagreeing . A large majority of people - 76 per cent - think that when a state rescues a bank it should also take control it, with 13 per cent take the opposite view . The ability of EU migrants to move to Britain to work, or claim benefits, has also dominated headlines in the run-up to polling day. Some 72 per cent of readers agreed that the right of EU citizens to work in the United Kingdom should be restricted, compared to 21 per cent who disagreed. Users were asked whether ‘immigrants must adapt to the values and culture of the United Kingdom’. Nine out of 10 people – 91 per cent - either completely agreed or agreed, with less than 1 per cent completely disagreeing. More than half of readers – 57 per cent – backed same sex couples having the same rights as heterosexual couples to marry, but fewer than a third disagreed. On the economy, more than half of MailOnline readers who took part in the survey – 55 per cent – do not think that wealth should be redistributed from the richest to the poorest, while 27 per cent said it should. Exploiting shale gas trapped deep underground is backed by 51 per cent of those people who took part in the survey on MailOnline last month . People convicted of less serous crimes should avoid prison, according to 53 per cent of MailOnline readers . 47 per cent of people said restricting citizen privacy was acceptable to combat crime, with 37 per cent disagreeing . Just 12 per cent of people who took part in the survey said the UK should welcome a larger number of asylum seekers from war-torn countries . The top rate of tax should be cut further from 45p, according to 44 per cent of readers while 39 per cent disagreed. More than three-quarters said that when a state rescues a bank it should take control of it while more than half of people said the government should go ahead with the exploitation of underground shale gas through the process known as fracking. On law and order, restrictions on citizen privacy to combat crime are backed by 47 per cent of readers, but opposed by 37 per cent. More than half of those who took part – 54 per cent – said less serious crimes should be punished with community service and not prison, with 35 per cent disagreeing. Only 12 per cent said the UK should welcome a larger number of asylum seekers from war-torn countries, with 71 per cent saying they disagreed. Dr. Matthew Wall, Lecturer of Political and Cultural Studies, Swansea University added: ‘The huge amount of readers that took the quiz has provided us with remarkable level of insight and understanding about how Mail Online readers feel about the issues being brought up by the European Elections. ‘What’s perhaps most interesting is the relatively even split over whether the UK should remain in the EU. It’s certainly going to make for an interesting election come May 22nd.'","40,000 people took part in  NatCen Social Research survey through MailOnline ahead of European elections this week .

"By . Lucy Crossley . A pilot managed to parachute to safety and land on a roof as his glider nose-dived into a field following a dramatic mid-air collision at 3,000ft. Onlookers said they saw the aircraft 'corkscrew' out of the sky, tumbling into a field after it struck another glider in the skies above the village of Great Gransden, Cambridgeshire. Fortunately the pilot managed to bail out of the falling glider and activate his parachute before he touched down on the roof of a farm outbuilding. Escape: A pilot managed to parachute to safety and land on a roof as his glider nose-dived into a field following a dramatic mid-air collision at 3,000ft . Drama: The pilot managed to bail out of the falling glider and activated his parachute before he tounched down on the roof of a farm outbuilding . He unhooked his canopy and climbed down and walked away unhurt. The second glider, which had been flying with a pilot and passenger, remained in the air and they safely returned to nearby Gransden Airfield where two planes had deparetd from. Eyewitness Adrian Penrose said: 'I was out in the garden enjoying the sun when I heard a strange noise. 'I looked up and saw this glider corkscrewing straight down - I couldn’t believe it. Landing: After landing on the roof the pilot was able to detach from his parachute and walk away from the farm building unharmed . 'It landed in a field and apparently gave a woman riding her horse quite a fright. 'I was so relieved when I saw the pilot’s parachute. It’s just so lucky that nobody was hurt.' The crashed glider landed around 200 yards away from buildings in Great Gransden. A spokeswoman from Cambridge Gliding Club said: 'At 13.35 on Sunday two gliders collided near Gransden Airfield.

"By . Martin Robinson . AstraZeneca has today rejected a 'final' £69.3billion takeover bid from US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, sending its own share price plummeting. The American business last night offered the board of the British company £55-a-share but said this would be their best and last offer. But AstraZeneca has quickly turned it down, which could now kill the deal unless they are offered closer to £60-a-share, sources have said. The decision sent its shares down 13 per cent when the London Stock Exchange opened this morning - a drop of £6 to £42 each. Its market value is now £52billion, £17billion less than the value Pfizer had put on the company. Takeover: Pfizer has improved its bid for British rival AstraZeneca to £55 a share but it was turned down this morning . AstraZeneca said today the proposed deal would bring 'uncertainty and risk' for its shareholders and 'undervalues the company and its attractive prospects'. Chairman Leif Johansson said: 'Pfizer's approach throughout its pursuit of AstraZeneca appears to have been fundamentally driven by the corporate financial benefits to its shareholders of cost savings and tax minimisation.' He said that from the time of initial talks in January, the US company had 'failed to make a compelling strategic, business or value case'. Pfizer . said it would only proceed with the takeover if it received the support . of the AstraZeneca board who have so far been hostile to the bid. AstraZenica previously rejected an offer worth £50-a-share claiming it undervalued the company. Pfizer has said if the deal is successful, it will create the world's largest pharmaceutical company with a headquarters in New York but based for tax reasons in Britain. AstraZeneca has laid out details of its pipeline of new drugs and argues there is no inevitability about a Pfizer deal, although its management also acknowledges the board would have to consider a compelling bid. There has been a mounting political backlash against the proposed deal in Britain, the United States and Sweden, where AstraZeneca has half its roots. Grim: This share graph shows how AstraZeneca's share price closed at more than £48 each on Friday, but fell to £42 each within minutes of opening today . The Swedish government launched a concerted effort on Friday against a merger it fears will lead to cuts in science jobs and research, echoing concerns aired by British lawmakers at two parliamentary hearings last week and fears for US jobs in states where AstraZeneca has a large presence. It came after a weekend of talks involving Mr Johannson, his chief executive Pascal Soriot and finance director Marc Dunoyer after Pfizer made an offer of £53.50 a share for the UK-based group.This was increased to £55 a share by Sunday evening but was again rejected today. Mr Johansson said that in response to the Friday offer, it had indicated that 'even assuming that other key aspects of the proposal had been satisfactory' that the price at which it would have been prepared to recommend a sale would be more than 10 per cent higher. He added: 'The final proposal is a minor improvement which continues to fall short of the board's view of value and has been rejected.' Pfizer said the new company would have its headquarters in New York but would have their tax base in Britain . Mr Johansson said Astra had created a 'culture of innovation, with science at the heart of its operations'. He reiterated widely expressed concerns that a deal would have 'serious consequences for the company, our employees and the life sciences sector in the UK, Sweden and the US'. Best bid: Pfizer, who make Viagra (pictured), said last night's bid is their final offer . Astra outlined four key points underlying its rejection of the deal, starting with planned cost-cutting which would 'imply a meaningful reduction in research and development potential and capabilities'. It also said the integration of the two companies would risk 'significant disruption' to the delivery of its new drugs - echoing Mr Soriot's claim before MPs last week that life-saving medicines could be delayed by the distraction caused by a mega-merger. The UK firm pointed as well to Pfizer's past record, saying its previous large-scale takeovers had 'highlighted the challenges around the negative impact of integration on research and development productivity and output'. Finally, Astra expressed concerns about the impact of plans by the US firm to separate out its operations into three business units. In addition, the rejection statement repeated the concern expressed about the 'tax-driven inversion structure' of the deal. This refers to the controversial proposal to re-domicile the newly merged giant to the UK for tax purposes while maintaining corporate headquarters in the US and a listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Astra noted in its statement that this had 'already been the subject of intense public and governmental scrutiny' and brought 'increased uncertainty' for shareholders. The company also pointed to the fact that the majority of the offer was still in the form of shares - which many Astra investors would have to sell. 'The board believes that Pfizer's final proposal, in relation to price, form of consideration and the four particular points that are central to the board's concerns around value, remains inadequate,' the firm said. 'Accordingly, the board has rejected the final proposal.'","Pfizer had offered £55-a-share to UK rival on basis it was their best offer .

"By . Amanda Williams . The dictionary makers have taken to Twitter to find new words for the next edition of the lexicon - asking users to choose which words should make the final edition . The latest edition of the Collins English Dictionary could include Twitter slang words such as 'adorkable' and 'fatberg'. The dictionary makers have taken to Twitter to find new words for the next edition of the lexicon - asking users to choose which words should make the final edition. The list of suggested words includes fracktivist - someone who protests against fracking - and felfie, a term used to describe a farmer who takes a selfie, or photograph of themselves. The 12th edition of the dictionary will be the first to contain a word that has been voted for by Twitter users - who have until midnight on May 28 to vote for the new word. Once selected, it will be included in the next edition of the dictionary, which is released in October. The dictionary publisher says that the rise of social media and the hashtag has seen new words and ideas - that they scout for every year - become mainstream much quicker than in the past. Andrew Freeman, associate publisher at Collins, said: 'Twitter offers us an immediate snapshot of how much a word is used. 'The tried and tested approach to compiling dictionaries has to adapt to embrace the ways in which language is developing through use on social media, and this is a fun way to get Twitter users involved in defining the English language.' Collins has been publishing the dictionary since 1819 and is the largest single volume dictionary in print, with the words it contains sourced from the Collins Corpus, which contains more than 4.5 billion words, as well as the open source site collinsdictionary.com, where users can submit words for consideration.

According to language experts, the list, which also contains the word adorkable, referring to someone who is dorky in an adorable way, is a sign of the way language is changing in the 21st century. Ian Brookes, lexicographer and consultant editor to the Collins English Dictionary, said: 'Language has always had to develop in response to changes in society and technology. In the 20th century the development of the motor car, air travel, television, and the personal computer changed the things that people did and so brought many new words into the language.

"By . Richard Spillett . With its boarded-up windows and faded whitewash walls, walkers could be forgiven for ignoring this decaying concrete building tucked away in the Welsh hills. But Criggion station, not far from Welshpool, Powys, was once the heartbeat of Britain's naval communications and played a vital role in many key military decisions. The centre was built during the Second World War amid fears the Germans could bomb the UK's main communications post at Rugby, Warwickshire. Criggion Station near Welshpool, Powys was once the centre of British naval communications, beaming messages out to submarines and battleships around the world . After it was abandoned at the end of the 1990s, the once-important building has since been left to rot and photos show the current state of its once-bustling halls . Radio devices which once sent out messages around the world have grown rusty while the building has been ignored and vandalised (left). Three radio masts (like that pictured, right) which stood at the site were demolished in 2003 . While Criggion was still being tested, a fire knocked out the centre at Rugby, making the Welsh station Britain's foremost naval communications post, sending out orders to our huge fleet of submarines and battleships. The station was used in ordering the sinking of German battleship Scharnhorst in 1943, seen as huge psychological blow for the German high command and the nation as a whole. But it was after the Second World War that the station was at its busiest. It became the top-secret hub of Cold War communications and 160 people worked at the site during the tense 1960s, as messages were beamed across the Atlantic during the Cuban Missile Crisis. As the centre of communications with missile-launching submarines, it was feared the site would be one of the first Russian targets in the event of nuclear war and it soon saw protests by nuclear disarmament campaigners and activists. The centre . remained key to Britain's naval communication right up until the end of . the 1990s, but its three 700ft-high radio masts and three 600ft-high . towers were demolished in 2003. Eerie new pictures of the abandoned building have emerged ahead of plans to turn it into a war museum. In its heyday in the 1960s, the centre was the hub of communications with Britain's nuclear submarines and was believed to be a key target in the case of a Russian missile strike . Locals now want to turn the building into a war museum, celebrating the centre's importance in many of Britain's 20th century conflicts . The building is nearby 'Rodney's Pillar', a 1782 monument dedicated to naval hero Vice-Admiral Sir George Bryden Rodney to commemorate the defeat of a French fleet in the West Indies . A panoramic view from beside Rodney's Pillar. The abandoned Criggion site lies in the shadow of this 'gateway to Wales' landmark . Local councillor Graham Brown, who is leading a campaign to revamp the decaying centre, said: 'You would not believe what went on in these buildings that were linked up to Hawaii and Colorado in the USA. 'It is believed Margaret Thatcher’s direct order to sink the Argentine ship the General Belgrano during the Falklands War was transmitted through Criggion. 'The buildings have been left to decay over the past decade but we want to turn them into a museum exhibition which could have both historical and educational value.' The area's naval traditions go back to the building of 'Rodney's Pillar' on Breidden, a mound created by underground volcanic activity. The 1782 monument which tops the hill is dedicated to naval hero Vice-Admiral Sir George Bryden Rodney, to commemorate the defeat of a French fleet in the West Indies. Four bidders are believed to have come forward to Criggion's current owners Telereal Trillium and the potential sale is expected to be completed by the end of June. Orders to sink the Scharnhorst (pictured left), a key German warship, during the Second World War, were sent from the station. The centre was at it busiest around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis, as US President John F Kennedy (pictured right) prepared for potential nuclear war on the other side of the Atlantic . The centre is believed to have been used to route orders from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to sink the Argentinian cruiser General Belgrano in 1982 .","Criggion station became Britain's most important naval communications centre during the Second World War .

"By . Amanda Williams . Wendy White has walked free from court and has been ordered to pay back just £1 in compensation after she bought a pre school to its knees . A bingo addicted mother who ran up £20,000 worth of debts and left a children’s nursery facing bankruptcy after she stole from its bank account has been ordered to pay back just £1. Wendy White, 35, stole thousands of pounds from the pre-school after her habit of playing an online version of the game left her massively in debt. Locking Stumps, in Birchwood, near Warrington, Cheshire was left just 'days from closure' after the mother-of-three plundered its account. In a desperate bid to prevent it from going bust, the school's skeleton staff of five agreed to work for free and parents launched fund raising events to help save it. White, an assistant manager at the pre school, admitted theft by employee but a judge at Warrington Crown Court told her she only needed to pay back the 'nominal' sum of a pound due to her 'extensive debts.' Speaking after the case, Gemma Antell, a trustee at the nursery which has 29 children on its roll said: 'We appreciate she has young children and a custodial sentence would have been difficult for but we don’t see what deterrent paying back £1 will serve. ''The penalty is completely pointless, we do not understand charging her £1. We were within days of closing, the only reason we didn’t close was because staff worked unpaid for months and the pre-school had to borrow money to pay bills. 'We can never thank staff enough, to do that shows their dedication. The parents in the community have fundraised and supported us to get us where we are today.' Christopher Bringau, 28, a parent of a child at the nursery said: 'Everyone is really shocked at the fact that this woman has only had to pay a pound. 'It’s ridiculous and it just goes to show people can steal and get away with it. It seems the message from the court is go ahead and spend other people’s money and it will be ok. 'People have said if this lady was that hard up, they would have leant her the money if she had asked.' He added: 'Both my kids have been to or go to the pre-school. I went in one day to collect my son and the staff were all crying because they didn’t have enough money to pay the wages. 'The company I own do charity organising so we stepped in to help. The pre-school was on the verge of closing and all the parents wondered where would our kids go. 'We thought it was terrible what happened. We did a couple of events at the local pub like charity fundraising evenings, BBQs and raffles. Locking Stumps pre-school was almost forced to close after the mum-of-three siphoned off cash from its account to help pay her online bingo debts . 'All the parents in the area rallied . around and thankfully we did enough to keep the pre school open. If it . wasn’t for the community doing that then we wouldn’t have a preschool . for our kids now - and all the troubles were down to one woman. 'Our . fundraiser raised £1,500 in just three weeks and the school staff were . over the moon. We’re just so relieved we saved the place from closing . down.' Earlier the court was . told White was responsible for financial affairs at the pre school but . began signing cheques to herself. Her thefts emerged in May last year . when trustees realised there was no money in the account. Prosecutor John Oates said: 'White was responsible for the financial affairs and was one of two people authorised to sign cheques on the school account. The co-signee was advised by the bank on May 16 that a cheque had bounced. “She was quite sure it shouldn’t have bounced because there was substantial funds in the account.' White was arrested later and confessed she had been signing cheques as she had debts in the region of £20,000 and had already taken out pay day loans to stem her debts caujsed by online bingo. She admitted stealing £2,212. Her defence counsel Mr Simeon Evans said: 'It’s a classic tale in the modern internet age and the accessibility to users of gambling which can be accessed from the comfort of one’s home in which enormous debts can be run up. White was arrested later and confessed she had been signing cheques as she had debts in the region of £20,000 and had already taken out pay day loans to stem her debts caujsed by online bingo. She admitted stealing £2,212.18 . 'Effectively her downfall can all link back to when she first discovered the world of online gambling. She was paying herself in advance and some times she managed to pay off a significant amount in her own wages but some times she couldn’t. 'She is a pariah in the small community because so many of her neighbours have children who go to the nursery. She is not only shunned but has remarks aimed at her in the street.' White was also given a 12 month community order including supervision. The judge Mr Recorder Geoffrey Lowe told her: . 'You had financial difficulties because of your initial and growing interest in online gambling. 'Everyone knows what you have done and the fact there has been a reaction to that is a profound punishment in itself.'","Wendy White, 35, stole thousands of pounds from the pre-school .

"By . Richard Spillett . With his red ministerial box perched handily within reach of the study desk, and the uncovered keys of his piano awaiting a tune, a visitor might think that Sir Edward Heath was merely away in London, sat gloomily in the House of Commons. The effect is perhaps exactly as the former Conservative Prime Minister intended when he stated in his will that his Arundells estate next to Salisbury Cathedral, Wiltshire should be opened to the public after he died in 2005. After struggles to maintain the wishes of the former Tory leader - known for his grumpiness after he was deposed by Margaret Thatcher - the house has now been re-opened exactly how it was in his final days. Sir Edward Heath's former home, Arundells, which is next to Salisbury Cathedral in Wiltshire has reopened to the public . Heath - a famously skilled pianist - kept photos of many of the famous leaders and figures he met during his life on his grand piano in one of the downstairs rooms . Visitors to the reopened property will, for the first time,  be able to view Heath's study, where he worked at a desk once owned by another former Prime Minister David Lloyd George . The estate first opened to the public in 2008, but the . charity running it has since had difficulty maintaining the initially high numbers of visitors and, at one point, they even considered selling the . property. After Peter Batey, Sir Edward’s former Private Secretary and now a business consultant, stepped in to cover a budget deficit, the house and gardens were re-opened to the public this spring. The house is set out exactly as the former Prime Minister, who held office from 1970 until 1974, left it when he died at the age of 89. His Order of the Garter, a high honour he received from the Queen in 2001, is on display, alongside photos of him with some of the 20th century's most important figures. Along with Chinese leader Chairman Mao, Cold War Russian premier Nikita Khrushchev and former US president Richard Nixon, are pictures of French President Georges Pompidou and German Chancellor Willy Brandt, raising memories of Heath's controversial decision to take Britain into the European Economic Community in 1973. The home's dining room, laid out exactly as it was in Heath's final days. The property also features paintings by famous artists including John Piper, Walter Sickert, John Nash and L S Lowry . Heath requested in his will that the historic house and gardens be kept open for public viewing, a duty that is upheld by the Sir Edward Heath Charitable Foundation . Heath, pictured outside his former home, moved into Arundells in 1985 and he died in the property 20 years later . Heath pictured in the garden of the house in 1993. There has been a garden on the site for at least 700 years . The visitors’ book contains the famous names of many of Heath's guests, including Sting, Bob Geldof, John Cleese, Des Lynam, Richard Branson and Princess Margaret. As well as gifts given to Heath by Chairman Mao, the house features paintings by Winston Churchill, William Wyllie, John Singer Sargent, John Piper, Walter Sickert, John Nash and L S Lowry. Champion sailor Heath - who won the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race in 1969 on his boat Morning Cloud - also brought together models of his many yachts in the house's impressive hall. A mixture of a number of architectural eras, the house is 18th century at the front and 13th century at the back. A housekeeper’s flat and staff offices occupy much of it, with the main section including just three bedrooms. The only other British leader to have their home open to the public is Sir Winston Churchill, whose Chartwell estate in Kent receives visitors. Arundells is open Saturday to Wednesday until October 29. The house includes photos and gifts from Chinese Communist leader Mao Tsetung, pictured here with Heath in 1975. File photo .

"By . Martin Robinson . A murderer who absconded from an open prison has today been traced and arrested after going on the run for the fourth time. Arnold Pickering, 44, who stabbed a blind man to death, was held for being unlawfully at large at an address in Oldham this morning. The killer was recaptured by Greater Manchester Police after failing to return to jail on Saturday afternoon. Thomas Moffett, a violent thief and fellow inmate with Nazi tattoos who was also on temporary licence, also absconded on the same day from the same prison.  Last night Moffett was arrested and being held in custody. Back in custody: Arnold Pickering (left), a convicted murderer, was found today, hours after robber Thomas Moffett (right) was also been recaptured in Blackburn . Their escape comes a fortnight after . Michael ‘Skull Cracker’ Wheatley absconded from an open prison and . allegedly robbed a building society before being caught four days later. Justice . Secretary Chris Grayling this morning promised to 'tear up' the current . day release programme and suggested prisoners who had a history of . escaping would no longer be allowed out. It came after MPs attacked the . 'absolute scandal' of murderers being allowed out of prison 'willy . nilly'. In 1991, a judge said Pickering . appointed himself as an ‘executioner’ when he decided to kill . 53-year-old Thomas Leigh, who was wrongly thought to be a paedophile. He . was serving 18 years for that murder when he went missing on Saturday. His three previous escapes have been from Strangeways in Manchester and . open prisons in Lancashire and Sussex. Pickering, 44, and Moffett, 51, . had been allowed out from HMP Kennet – an open category C prison in . Maghull, Merseyside – at 9.30am on Saturday. They failed to return as . agreed at 4.30pm. Moffett, . who has swastika tattoos on his arms, was jailed for seven years in 2006 . for a two-month spree of ‘professionally executed robberies’. He . threatened shop workers with a nail gun in a series of raids on off-licences in Blackburn. He was caught after an employee slipped an . explosive dye pack into a bundle of cash. Crime: The men failed to return to prison after leaving HMP Kennet, in Maghull, at around 9.30am on Saturday morning . The day release programme is designed to help prisoners settle back into ordinary life towards the end of their sentence by allowing them to attend work or training. But it has come under fierce attack for leaving the public at risk from unreformed, dangeours criminals. The Government has admitted that more than 1,600 murderers, druglords and other hardened criminals were granted day release last year. Last July, Ian McLoughlin (pictured above) was convicted of murdering Graham Buck in the village of Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, while on day release. Murderer Joseph Williams carried out 11 armed raids on bookmakers after being handed a release pass in 2010. And Mark Neville, a drug dealer, spent his day out of prison in 2008 overseeing a £14million cocaine deal. Last week it was revealed more than 400 killers were kept in open prisons, which have minimal supervision. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling this morning added: 'I'm not happy with the way things are at the moment. 'Although the number of people absconding is tiny, we've seen in the last few months a number of serious offences committed by people on temporary licence. But we are tearing up the system as it exist at moment.' Mr Grayling said he would ban prisoners being allowed to walk around town centres.He said: 'Town-leavers will only be allowed out on temporary licence to do something tangible like a day's work. 'Serious offenders will be subject to a much stricter risk assessment. And I can't see why we allow back into open conditions people who have absconded before, so I'm looking at moving reforms in that area quickly. 'People who have absconded cannot go back to open conditions. These changes will happen within next few weeks.' But prison officers said overcrowding and job cuts were to blame for the escapes. Peter McParlin, chairman of the Prison Officers Association, said: 'We have been saying for many years now that we have overcrowding in the prison estate, people are being put into open conditions who are unsuitable for open conditions. 'Twenty prisons have closed in the last three years and prison staff numbers have reduced by 6,000 since 2010. ""There is immense pressure on the system and it is clear to me that the tick box mentality that goes into transferring prisoners to open conditions has failed the public. Tory . MP Philip Davies added: ‘Convicted murderers should not be released on . temporary licence, it’s common sense, the public are being put at . unnecessary risk. The idea that there is a robust risk assessment in . place is for the birds, the system is in complete shambles. ‘If it wasn’t so serious it would be funny, but these are dangerous people who the public deserve to be protected against.’ Armed robber Michael Wheatley, AKA the Skull Cracker, went on the run for four days after absconding from open prison . He said the disappearances were an 'absolute scandal' and questioned why convicted murderers were ever given temporary release when figures which he obtained through parliamentary answers showed 106 had absconded in the past 10 years. A . spokesman for Merseyside police said both Pickering and Moffett had . been ‘risk assessed’ as suitable for release, but warned the public not . to approach them and to call officers instead. Pickering was jailed for life with a minimum of 18 years for stabbing Mr Leigh to death in Oldham. But . he absconded while in the exercise yard of Strangeways prison and later . went on the run from Kirkham open prison in Lancashire after being let . out to empty bins in Manchester city centre. Kent Police issued this mugshot of 'Skull Cracker' Michael Wheatley, after he went missing while temporarily being allowed out of prison earlier this month . He . disappeared from Ford open prison in Sussex in 2006 and spent nine days . on the run before being caught in a flat in Bournemouth. A . third prisoner who absconded from HMP Kennet two months ago remains on . the loose. Robert Gavin, 36, disappeared on March 23 and police say the . robber poses a risk to some former contacts.

"By . Sebastian Shakespeare . and James Chapman . and Richard Eden . The founder of Ukip last night revived claims that Nigel Farage repeatedly used  the n-word when referring to black voters – as the party was plunged into turmoil over allegations of racism. Professor Alan Sked said a storm of controversy provoked by Mr Farage’s remarks last week about Romanians ‘backs up what I have always said’ about the Ukip leader’s private views on race. ‘He told me, “We needn’t worry about the n****r vote”,’ Professor Sked told the Daily Mail. ‘He added: “The n**-n**s will never vote for us.”’ Scroll down for video . Distanced: Ukip founder Professor Alan Sked, who revived claims that leader Nigel Farage repeatedly used the N-word when referring to black voters . The professor of international history at the London School of Economics added: ‘His comments were made when he was urging me to allow former National Front candidates to stand for Ukip [in 1997]. I refused.’ Professor Sked resigned as Ukip leader in 1997 because of what he said was a growing influence of the far-Right in the party’s ranks. Denial: Mr Farage said the claims made by Professor Sked were 'absurd' ‘They are obsessed by immigration, Islam and race. When I first reported that Farage had used those words, he got [disgraced publicist] Max Clifford to ring up the newspaper [in which the report appeared] and threaten to sue. He never did.’ Professor Sked’s claims, which were denied as ‘absurd’ by Mr Farage, came amid chaos in Ukip ranks over a ‘car crash’ radio interview the party leader gave last week. Over the weekend, Ukip was defiant over Mr Farage’s suggestion on LBC radio on Friday that he would feel uncomfortable if Romanians moved in next door. Challenged over the difference between Romanians and Germans, the Ukip leader, who is married to a German and has bilingual children, retorted: ‘You know what the difference is.’ But last night Mr Farage offered a semi-apology, though aides said he stood by his central suggestion that Romanian immigrants were responsible for a crime wave. ‘I regret the fact that I was completely tired out. I didn’t use the form of words in response that I would have liked to have used,’ he told ITV News. Labour leader Ed Miliband insisted the Ukip leader was guilty of a ‘racial slur’. ‘I think his remarks he made were deeply offensive ... I think they were a racial slur,’ Mr Miliband said. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Mr Farage’s mask was beginning to slip, and ‘behind the beer-swilling bonhomie is a really nasty view of the world’. Despite a slew of allegations of racism, misogyny and homophobia against Ukip candidates, polls suggest Ukip could be on the cusp of a historic victory in Thursday’s European elections. Criticism: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Mr Farage’s mask was beginning to slip while David Cameron condemned his remarks about Romanians as 'frankly unpleasant' A ComRes survey yesterday put Ukip ahead with the support of 35 per cent of those certain to vote – 11 points ahead of Labour. However, an ICM poll suggested Ukip had slipped to third place behind Labour and the Conservatives. A third poll for YouGov, which has placed Ukip ahead of Labour in polls for the European elections four times, yesterday had them one point behind. Labour were on 27 per cent, Ukip on 26 per cent and the Conservatives on 23 per cent. A spokesman for Mr Farage said of Professor Sked’s claims, which he first made in 2005: ‘There is no truth to these allegations and never has been. Many observers would be forgiven for feeling Professor Sked simply cannot come to terms with a party he founded but fronted with very little success being on the verge of a massive breakthrough in British politics. ‘We will not allow his frequent regurgitation of this absurd claim to deflect us from our work.’ David Cameron yesterday shied away from direct criticism of Mr Farage, having condemned his remarks about Romanians as ‘frankly unpleasant’. He said the Conservatives had a ‘very clear message’ for the European elections ‘which is “look, Labour and the Liberals think there is nothing wrong with Europe, Ukip think there’s nothing right, we think you’ve got to get stuck in, change it, get a better deal for Britain and give people a referendum”.’","Professor Alan Sked said Ukip leader's remarks over Romanians 'backs up what I have always said'

"By . Harriet Arkell . The British director of a new film on the artist JMW Turner has said that his film is 'not a documentary' and anyone who complains about it straying from the facts can 'f*** off'. Mike Leigh, 71, spoke out against pedantic art historians at the Cannes Film Festival, where his new biopic, Mr Turner, is one of 18 in the running for this year's Palme d'Or award. Speaking alongside actor Timothy Spall, who plays the Romantic landscape artist, Leigh said he was anticipating criticism from Turner anoraks. Scroll down for video . Artist JMW Turner is the subject of Mr Turner, a new biopic by Mike Leigh, centre, starring Timothy Spall, right . Spall stars as the eccentric landscape painter in the film which, says Leigh, is not strictly historically accurate . He said: 'The Turneracs, as we call them - the real Turner nuts - haven't seen it yet, but we've ordered some protective armour to wear at the screening. 'It's not a documentary, but there's always going to be some serious complainers.' The ebullient director, who won the Palme d'Or in 1996 for his film Secrets & Lies, added: 'But hey, they can f*** off,' the Times reported. Leigh, whose other hit films include Abigail's Party and Life Is Sweet, said his new film was based closely upon the artist's life, though it did not stick 100 per cent to the facts for the plot. But he said he and his team had worked hard to make it as realistic as possible, by studying the artist's letters and written by works to get a feel for how he spoke, as well as striving to make sure the costumes and houses were historically correct. The film, described by Mail film critic Brian Viner as 'something of a masterpiece', tells the story of the later years of the eccentric painter. Artist: Spall portrays Turner as a neglectful father and melancholic, but prone to great bursts of bonhomie . Landscape: The film's British director said he went to great lengths to ensure the film's authenticity . Its precise depiction of the Victorian era is based in meticulous research; Leigh told the audience in Cannes how he believed compromising on dialogue or costumes resulted in unconvincing films which audiences would struggle to believe in. He also told how he fell out with the owner of a period house who refused to let him paint it black, as it would have been at the time, for the film. Last week, Timothy Spall told how he spent two years learning how to paint before making the film, and said he spent hours in the Tate gallery looking at Turner's paintings 'until the colours got into the bloodstream'. Leigh said he would not stay on in Cannes this week to find out if he had won the prestigious film prize, following previous years when he missed out on it having packed his black tie and bought the plane tickets.  This year, he said, he would be staying at home. Born in 1943, Leigh is best known for his grittily realistic depictions of people's everyday lives. He began as a playwright in the 1960s before he began making films for television. It was in 1977, with his suburban satire Abigail's Party, that he made a name for himself.  Starring Alison Steadman, who was married to Leigh from 1973-2001, it centred on a toe-curling suburban drinks party with lines such as 'Tone?  A little cheesy-pineapple one?'. Mike Leigh's long career has included such hits as Abigail's Party, Secrets & Lies, and Life Is Sweet . Cult classic: Leigh's 1977 masterpiece Abigail's Party starred his then wife, Alison Steadman, top right . In 1989, his bitter satire, High Hopes, portrayed life in post-Thatcher England, and won the Venice Film Festival's FIPRESCI prize. The following year, Leigh's comedy Life Is Sweet garnered massive acclaim, featuring Jane Horrocks as a bulimic insecure young woman, as well as Steadman, Jim Broadbent, and Mr Turner star, Timothy Spall. And in 1993 his bleak film Naked, starring David Thewlis as a drifter, won huge acclaim, with Thewlis named Best Actor at Cannes and Leigh named Best Director. Leigh, whose other works include Vera Drake and Topsy-Turvy, was honoured at Cannes again in 1996 for his film Secrets & Lies, telling the story of a woman's adoption and reunion with her family.  The film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes and actress Brenda Blethyn won Best Actress at the Golden Globes. Leigh, who has two grown-up sons by Steadman, now lives in Camden, north London. The painter lived from 1775-1851 and was considered controversial for his almost impressionistic style . Turner is considered to have elevated landscape painting to a position rivalling that of historical painting .","The 71-year-old British film director speaks out at the Cannes Film Festival .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Ian MacDonald discovered he had lung cancer when blundering hospital officials sent his test results to his home address by mistake . A grandfather discovered he had lung cancer when hospital test results were mistakenly sent to his home, rather than to his consultant. Ian McDonald, 78, found his diagnosis in the last line of a six-page report, revealing he had 'bi-lateral carcinoma (cancer) of the right lung'. The diagnosis came after Mr MacDonald underwent a radiology examination, and was told to expect a further appointment date in the post, where he would be told the results. But he received the news in the post on a Saturday late last year, leaving him and his wife Irene to face an anxious wait to speak to his doctor the following Monday. The couple, from Rosyth on the Firth of Forth, have since received an apology from Ninewells Hospital in Dundee. Administrators there should have directed the test results to Mr MacDonald's consultant at the Queen Margaret Hospital in Dunfermline. 'I was stunned to be told in such a blundering way,' Mr MacDonald said. 'To be honest, I thought someone would sit me down and break the news more gently. 'Instead I had to read through a detailed MRI report peppered with all sorts of information. 'It said my kidneys and liver were clear but when I reached the last line it told me I had 'bi-lateral carcinoma of the right lung', which is the medical term for lung cancer. 'I felt I had been handed the worst news possible in a shocking manner. 'What I received was obviously part of my hospital notes.' The former Royal Navy engineer, spent the weekend coming to terms with the diagnosis and consoling his wife. 'I had to set my own feelings aside and help her because she was distraught,' he added. He claims his consultant at the Queen Margaret was furious the news was broken in such a slapdash way. The six-page report, which revealed Mr MacDonald had 'bi-lateral carcinoma of the right lung', should have been sent by Ninewells Hospital in Dundee to Mr MacDonald's consultant at the Queen Margaret Hospital in Dumferline . Mr Macdonald, a father-of-six, said: 'I was stunned to find out in such a blundering way' 'We were asked to see him straight away and he did his best to make us feel at ease, but it was clear he was far from happy,' Mr MacDonald said. 'I've heard other people have been treated in the same way.' Father-of-six Mr MacDonald, who worked as a driver after leaving the navy, has since received an apology from NHS Tayside. It arrived in December, two weeks after he was wrongly sent the medical notes. The paperwork contained the results of his full-body MRI scan, which was prompted by his GP who was worried about Ian's persistent cough and breathlessness. Mr MacDonald has since undergone chemotherapy to stabilise the cancer but doctors have warned him surgery is not possible. He said: 'They say it is inoperable and I will know in a few weeks if the drugs have halted the spread.' The 78-year-old former Royal Navy engineer received the letter one Saturday late last year, leaving him and his wife Irene an anxious wait before they could speak to Mr MacDonald's doctor the following Monday . Mr MacDonald, who retired in 1996, believes the cancer may be a legacy from exposure to radiation fallout he received while serving with the Royal Navy during the Christmas Island nuclear test explosions. He said: 'I have been told that those who were near the test grounds in the Pacific islands in 1957 are at a higher risk.' A spokeperson for NHS Tayside said: 'We have apologised to Mr MacDonald for this administrative error and have made changes to our IT processes to minimise the risk of this happening in future.'","Ian MacDonald received a six-page hospital report by mistake .

"By . Martin Robinson . Strife: Michael O'Leary's Ryanair has revealed its first drop in profits for five years but maintains their customer service is improving . Ryanair has suffered its first fall in annual profits for five years but maintains its much-maligned customer service is improving 'rapidly'. The budget airline has today revealed its post-tax profits were eight per cent lower at £426.5million (523million euros) to the end of March 2014 - down around £37million on a year earlier. The slide came despite boss Michael O'Leary's promise that the company would 'stop unnecessarily . p****** people off' and treating customers 'like the enemy'. Today the chief executive described the results as disappointing but said efforts . since September to reinvent Ryanair's image and reputation helped . passenger traffic rise four per cent in the second half of the year. After years of growth the budget airline was forced to issue an unprecedented two profits warnings in the past 12 months. O'Leary also decided to offer a more 'sophisticated' experience of passengers, including ending the scramble to get on his planes by offering allocated seating for almost £5. As part of ending the airline's 'over-abrupt', 'go to hell' culture, he also promised strict hand-luggage . restrictions would be relaxed. He also pledged not to overly penalise passengers who make a ‘genuine . mistake’ – such as forgetting to bring their boarding card, which often . results in a £70 charge to reprint them.

"By . James Chapman . Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has warned he may take action over large mortgages . Housebuyers could be banned from borrowing many times their salaries to cool the property market – as new figures suggest the price of the average home is rising by almost £10,000 a month. The Governor of the Bank of England expressed concern about the return of large mortgages and suggested that the Government’s flagship scheme to make home loans cheaper will be reined in  within months. Mark Carney said he was ready to take action on a number of fronts if Britain’s resurgent housing market begins to threaten the economy. He expressed particular concern about the return of big mortgages – more than four and a half times a borrower’s salary – which were widespread before the financial crash of 2007 and now ‘creeping up’ again. The Governor is thought to be worried that Help to Buy – by sending a message that houses can be bought with a deposit of as little as five per cent – might encourage other homebuyers to borrow than they should. Startling figures published  by Rightmove show asking prices rose by 8.9 per cent in the year to May, meaning the average property is on sale at a record high of £272,003. The annual rate crept closer to the 10.4 per cent seen in October 2007 while a month-on-month increase of 3.6 per cent, or £9,409, was the highest ever seen for the time of year. The Daily Mail revealed earlier this month that discussions were underway in Whitehall and at the Bank on paring back Help to Buy following warnings of a risk of Britain’s housing market overheating. Carney's wrning comes as new figures suggest house prices are rising by almost £10,000 a month . Senior Tories dismiss claims of a bubble, pointing out prices remain a long way off their pre-crisis peak in most areas. But yesterday Mr Carney said it was clear there were ‘deep, deep structural problems’ in the market and it represented the biggest risk to the economic recovery. ‘There are not sufficient houses built in the UK,’ the governor said. Mr Carney suggested the Bank could adopt a range of measures  including a new ‘affordability test’ for borrowers and advising the Government to rein in Help to Buy . He told Sky News’s Murnaghan programme. ‘We could limit amounts of certain types of mortgages that banks could undertake, we could provide advice ... on changing the terms of Help to Buy.’ The scheme guarantees £130billion of mortgages, and is available for loans of between 80 per cent and 95 per cent of the home value. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg suggested the Government was ready to act, telling the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme: ‘If [Carney] says we should pare back on some government schemes like Help to Buy then I think we should do that.’ Prime Minister David Cameron said the governor was ‘absolutely right when he says fundamentally we need to build more houses in Britain.’ He added: ‘Now we have reformed the planning system to simplify it, the building of houses is going up.'","Mark Carney warns he is ready to take action to cool property market .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Comedian Paul Merton, 57, claims he no longer enjoys stand-up comedy and now prefers improvisation sketches . Comedian Paul Merton has turned his back on stand-up comedy for good because drunken hecklers have ruined the atmosphere of the genre which made him famous. The performer and TV presenter, who has appeared as a team captain on BBC’s Have I Got News For You for more than two decades, claims he doesn’t even go to watch stand-up shows anymore because he simply doesn’t enjoy them. The 57-year-old, who made his name as a comedian in the 1980s and broke onto the scene with Channel 4’s Saturday Night Live, said stand-up is no longer his ‘idea of relaxation’. ‘I’d go along thinking, “That’s a good joke”, or “That joke could be better”,’ he told The Times. ‘It’s not something that interests me to be honest.’ The comic, who is married to fellow comedian Suki Webster, now prefers improvisation describing it as way to break out of the straightjacket performances stand-up offers, which he claims he wasn’t ‘temperamentally suited’ to. His life-long love affair with improvisation prompted him to create Impro Chums – a unique comedy show which sees him and four others perform sketches based entirely on suggestions from the audience. The ‘chums’, made up of Merton, his wife Suki, Richard Vranch, Lee Simpson and Mike McShane, are set to take the show to the Edinburgh Fringe this year – but it will start no later than 4pm to avoid the rowdy crowds late night shows bring. ‘A comedian can have put-downs ready but if you had a row of drunken hecklers at an impro show they would completely destroy it,’ Merton said. Despite turning his back on the world of stand-up for good, the performer is still set to continue with his role on Have I Got News For You, which ultimately helped cement his fame. Paul Merton, right, has appeared as a team captain on the BBC's Have I Got News For You alongside Ian Hislop, left, for more than two decades after making his name as a comic through Saturday Night Live in the 1980s . The 57-year-old comedian and TV presenter, pictured hosting BBC's Room 101 show, now prefers improvisation and his most-recent show, Impro Chums, is set to feature at this year's Edinburgh Fringe Festival . The show, which is now in its 24th year, . has survived many controversies, not least the departure of host Angus . Deayton in 2002, which Merton was at the centre of. At the time he said he ‘couldn’t care less’ who replaced Deayton, who was dismissed from his role after BBC executives and the show’s makers, Hat Trick Productions, claimed press coverage into his personal life - including accusations of prostitutes and cocaine use - was making his role as host ‘untenable’. It was widely known that Merton, and his rival team captain Ian Hislop, supported the decision because keeping him on would have compromised the show. Paul Merton with his wife Suki Webster in 2010 . ‘I don’t think I ever behaved in an underhand way towards Angus’, Merton said in the aftermath of the scandal. ‘Michael Parkinson once asked me whether I felt I’d stabbed him in the back and I replied, “No, I stabbed him in the front.” To be honest, I don’t think I even did that. 'Angus had to go, but it wasn’t me who forced the issue. ‘He was a great straight man. The problem was that his place on the show had become untenable.’ Nowadays, the comedian keeps himself out of the limelight – even avoiding social media. After the breakdown of his first marriage to actress Caroline Quentin, the comic started seeing TV producer Sarah Parkinson, marrying her in 2003, shortly before her death from breast cancer. It was in 2004 he met his now-wife Suki, and since their marriage in 2009 they have managed to live away from the glare of media attention. ‘That’s deliberate,’ he said. ‘I don’t like red-carpet events. The celebrity world means nothing to me.’","The 57-year-old comedian claims stand-up is no longer his 'idea of relaxation'

"By . Mark Duell . Parents have been left furious by a scheme punishing schoolchildren for being off sick for just one day by excluding them from a free trip to the ice-cream van. Pupils at West Horndon Primary School in Essex with a 97 per cent attendance record at the end of each half-term are rewarded with membership of ‘The 99ers Club’, entitling them to a free ice-cream. But those youngsters who fall short of the benchmark are made to wait indoors while their classmates go to collect their cornets from the van outside. Prize: Children will find out this Friday whether they have earned an ice-cream for missing no more than half a day of school since Easter (file picture) And now some parents have registered formal complaints with headteacher Matt O’Grady, claiming children as young as five are too young to understand why they are not allowed an ice-cream. The scheme was launched as a trial in February - with the first round of ice-creams awarded on the last day of term before Easter. Children will find out this Friday whether they have earned an ice-cream for missing no more than half a day of school since Easter. By Friday, there will have been 23 school days since Easter Monday, meaning that to achieve at least a 97 per cent record, pupils will need to have attended school for at least 22.5 days in that period. One local parent, who did not want to be named, said: ‘It’s created merry hell as you can imagine - it’s outrageous. The ones who didn’t get it were left in the classroom watching the ice-cream van. ‘At the end of the day you’re talking about pretty young kids who just don’t understand it. The kids in Years 1 and 2, they didn’t understand what was going on.’ However, Mr O’Grady said the trial scheme had been well received by the majority of parents, as well as the local educational welfare officer.

"By . Emma Innes . He is her best friend, her guardian angel and her housekeeper. Meet Billy the Jack Russell who not only empties his owner’s washing machine, helps her get dressed and answers the door to visitors – he has also saved her life. Billy, who is eight, lives with Carol Willacy, 45, in Fleetwood, Lancashire. Billy, a Jack Russell, is an assistance dog who lives with Carol Willacy, 45. Ms Willacy has severe arthritis . Ms Willacy has had severe osteoarthritis for eight years and spinal damage caused by falling off a horse and has mobility problems as a result. She also suffers from unexplained extreme fatigue and uses a wheelchair to get around. She told MailOnline: ‘Billy is my world – he is everything to me. I just think that whatever else life throws at me, nothing really matters as long as I’ve got him. ‘I feel like the luckiest person in the world that I get to spend my days with him. ‘He really is a dog in a million – I have never known another one like him and I have had dogs all my life. He is my guardian angel. When Ms Willacy was first unwell, she accompanied a friend who was going to look at a puppy. Billy helps his owner by emptying the washing machine, putting his head inside it to check he has taken everything out and then closing the door behind him . Billy is also able to open and close doors for Ms Willacy. He open them by pulling on ropes attached to the door handles. He then closes them again by pushing them closed with his body . While they were meeting the puppies, they noticed that the one her friend was buying did not want to be separated from its brother. As a result, Ms Willacy decided to buy the brother – Billy – because she lives next door to her friend and the puppies would be able to grow up together. Initially, Billy was just a pet. However, when he was about a year old, Mr Willacy saw an assistance dog on the television and wondered whether Billy could also be taught some of the skills this dog had. As a result, she called the charity Support Dogs, in Sheffield, to ask about training. After an assessment, Billy was accepted on to a training programme. Ms Willacy said: 'Billy is my world - he is everything to me. I just think that whatever else life throws at me, nothing really matters as long as I've got him' Ms Willacy bought Billy as a pet but she then saw another assistance dog and wondered whether Billy could learn some of the same skills. As a result, he went to the charity Support Dogs for training . He had four weeks of initial training with the charity and then Ms Willacy joined him for another two weeks of training. He then spent three months practicing his new found skills before graduating as a fully qualified assistance dog. He is now able to empty the washing machine, check he has removed all of the clothes and then close the door. He can also open and close the front door using ropes attached to the door handle and he can help Ms Willacy take her shoes and coat off. He can . also find items that she asks him for – including keys, her phone and . the television remote control – and picks up anything she has dropped. He even turns on lights when he enters a room and then turns them off again when he leaves. Billy can also help Ms Willacy take her shoes and coat off when she comes into the house . On one occasion, Ms Willacy collapsed in her garden and Billy ran down the road to find her carer who lives nearby. He located her house and led her to Ms Willacy even though he had never been there before . Ms Willacy said: ‘He does simple things that make a tremendous difference. ‘He is my little hero. He tries to do everything for me – he is incredibly protective.’ She added: ‘If my cats annoy him he chases them out of the back door and then closes the door behind them.’ But Billy is not only better at housework than the average man – he has also saved Ms Willacy’s life. Last summer she was doing some gardening when she became very tired. Determined to finish it, she persisted, but she soon collapsed. Unbeknown to her, Billy ran to a neighbour’s house and started pawing at the front door. This neighbour had just accepted a job as Ms Willacy’s carer but Billy had never been to her house. It remains a mystery how he knew the way. On another occasion, Ms Willacy collapsed on a winter's night and Billy licked her face until she came round . The carer heard him pawing at the door and opened it to find him running up and down the road. She followed him and he led her straight to Ms Willacy who was still unconscious in the garden. Fortunately, when the carer shook her, she came round and was able to be put to bed to recover. On another occasion, Ms Willacy fainted while getting out of her car on a dark winter’s night. She eventually came round two hours later to discover that Billy had been licking her face since she lost consciousness. She believes that had he not kept licking her, she would have remained unconscious outside all night. On . a third occasion, Ms Willacy woke up with breathing difficulties and . found that the cords she uses to pull herself up in bed were tangled up. She started to panic but before she knew it, Billy had turned the lights on and untangled the cords so that she could sit up. Ms Willacy said: 'He does simple things that make a tremendous difference. He is my little hero. He tries to do everything for me - he is incredibly protective' Ms Willacy is now a staunch supporter of Support Dogs. She told MailOnline: ‘The charity is amazing but they are struggling for funds at the moment. ‘They get no help from the government so they have to rely on public donations. ‘They are the most fantastic people you could ever meet – I really owe my life to them.’ For more information, or to support the charity, visit www.support-dogs.org.uk . Billy has been entered into the Drontal Special Roles competition run by Drontal, a maker of animal worming products. The competition is seeking to find some of Britain's most exceptional pets and the winning owner will receive £500 in cash and their pet with feature in a Drontal magazine advert.

"By . Hazel Knowles . A pet dog was crushed to death by a 16ft-long python in front of a British mother and her two horrified young children. Art dealer Katie Heyring was on a countryside hike with daughter Kaia, seven, son Kaspar, five, and their five dogs when the snake struck. Charlie, a mongrel cross, had run ahead of the family along a path in Hong Kong’s Sai Kung West Country Park on Saturday. Tragic: Family pet Charlie, who was crushed to death by a snake while out walking with its owners on Saturday. The family were walking in Sai Kung West Country Park when the 16ft creature struck . Mrs Heyring, 41, tried to fight off the snake by hitting the serpent with a walking stick but eventually fled with her children when she realised Charlie was dead. The tragedy comes two weeks after a British couple fought off a python attacking their dog in another part of the same park. Different snakes are believed to be responsible for the two attacks, which were five miles apart, but the latest incident was in an area where there have been three other python attacks on dogs in recent years, one of them fatal. Mrs Heyring, from Windsor, Berkshire, deals in Vietnamese art and has lived in Hong Kong with her husband and children for two years. They are planning an imminent return to Britain as their two older children are at boarding school in the UK. Mrs Heyring yesterday explained how Charlie, who the family adopted from a rescue centre, was  killed by the snake. Shock: Katie Heyring with another one of her pets. She said today the attack was 'terrifying' ‘It was massive,’ she said. ‘It had to easily be about 16ft because Charlie was a big dog of about four-and-a-half stone and he was almost the size of my Labrador. ‘The scary thing is that it happened so quickly, from hearing Charlie’s awful squeal and coming round the corner to being confronted by the horrific sight of the huge snake coiled around Charlie. ‘It was terrifying. The kids were screaming and the other dogs were barking. They were going ballistic. ‘After about a minute of me hitting it, Charlie stopped squealing and I knew that was it. ‘There was nothing I could do and I just had to get the kids and the other dogs away. ‘We are all very upset. Charlie was a rescue puppy. He was about 18 months old and a lovely dog. ‘It was a horrific thing to witness and to feel so helpless. I had my husband’s diving knife in the back pack because I had read about the snake attack the other week, but the snake was colossal and I was so scared it would turn on the kids. ‘My youngest is about the same size as Charlie. I keep thinking “what if my son Kaspar had been in front?”. What would the snake have done to him? It’s just too horrible to contemplate.’ Two weeks ago British expatriates Courtney Link and her husband Pete managed to rescue their 4st dog Dexter from the grip of a python which attacked as they walked around a coastal peninsula about five miles from the scene of Saturday’s attack. There have been three other python attacks on dogs since 2006 close to the spot of the latest attack. Two were rescued but the third, a husky, died. Briton Dave Willott, who works as a part-time snake catcher in Hong Kong, said it was possible the python which attacked Charlie could be the same snake behind the three previous attacks. A python, similar to the one that attacked and crushed Charlie to death. The attack comes just two weeks after another British couple lost their dog to a snake in the same Hong Kong park . He recommended pet owners not let their dogs off the leash, as pythons were predators which lie in wait for passing mammals. ‘Many times people ask me what they should they do if a python attacks their dog,’ he said. ‘You have to really go for it. Grab it by the tail and start yanking it and walking backwards. ‘Pythons don’t like the idea of not being anchored down. It might tighten up at first but keeping pulling it by the tail and it will let go.’ Pythons are Hong Kong’s biggest natural predator and are protected under law. They can grow up to   20ft long and normally feed on small mammals and wild boar.","Katie Heyring was hiking with her children and five dogs on Saturday .

"By . Sam Webb . Forces loyal to a rogue Libyan general attacked the country's parliament today, claiming they are targeting Islamist politicians who protect the extremist militias now plaguing the nation. Lawmakers in Tripoli were forced to flee the attack, which was met with resistance from other troops, Mohammed al-Hegazi, a spokesman for General Khalifa Hifter, told Libya's al-Ahrar television station. Gunfire near parliament could be heard for miles around. Scroll down for videos . In this Saturday, May 17, 2014 photo, Libyan Gen. Khalifa Hifter addresses a press conference in Benghazi, Libya. The death toll from fighting over the weekend in Libya's eastern city of Benghazi between troops loyal to Hifter, a rogue general, and Islamist militias has risen to at least 70, the Health Ministry said on Sunday. In a statement late Saturday, Libya's interim prime minister, parliament speaker and the head of military warned Hifter against further pursuing his offensive and threatened the troops cooperating with him. (AP Photo/Mohammed el-Shaiky) Smoke billowed from a distance over the parliament building, as witnesses said the attacking forces shelled the building from the southern edge of the city. Al-Hegazi said Hifter blames the officials for allowing extremists forces to exert unrivalled influence in the country. A security official said the attackers also shelled a nearby military base controlled by an Islamist militia. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief journalists. 'This parliament is what supports these extremist Islamist entities,' al-Hegazi told the station. 'The aim was to arrest these Islamist bodies who wear the cloak of politics.' Al-Hegazi said forces loyal to Hifter met resistance from militias he accused of 'holding the country hostage'. He called the parliament the 'heart of the crisis' in Libya. Hifter is carrying out an offensive against Islamist militias in Benghazi, the country's second-largest city in the east. He says the central government and parliament have no mandate and vowed to press on with his operation after authorities called it a coup. The country has struggled to implement an effective government since Gaddafi (pictured) was toppled in 2011 . Since Hifter's offensive in Benghazi began on Friday, many of his supporters have pushed for him to take action in the capital, Tripoli, complaining about the ineffective government. Lawmakers say security officials evacuated them from the building out of fears it would be stormed. Libya's parliament is divided between Islamist and non-Islamist forces who have bickered over appointing a new government and holding new elections. Recently, Islamists forces backed the naming of a new prime minister, amid walkouts from the non-Islamist groups. But splits in Libya are also regional and . ethnic, with longstanding rivalries between the country's eastern and . western regions. The new interim prime minister has not yet named a Cabinet. A spokesman for the Libyan Revolution Operation Room, an umbrella group of militias groups who answer to the interim parliament and are in charge of the security in the capital, said fighters engaged the attackers but there were no reports of casualties. Forces loyal to the interim parliament set up checkpoints around the parliament, sending journalists away. An Associated Press journalist saw militias armed with machine-gun mounted vehicles gather near the parliament. The security official told the AP that lawmakers received warnings ahead of the attack that the building would be assaulted. Al-Ahrar reported the same. The bases of the al-Qaaqaa and Sawaaq militias are located near the parliament. They both operate under the government's mandate but back non-Islamist political forces. The fighting that broke out in Benghazi on Friday killed 70 people, Libya's Health Ministry said Sunday. Benghazi, the birthplace of the 2011 uprising that toppled Libya's late dictator Moammar Gadhafi, was quiet Sunday, though its airport remained closed for a second day. Libya's weak central government describes the offensive by forces loyal to Hifter, which includes air support, as tantamount to a coup. The violence there and in the capital, Tripoli, shows how precarious government control remains three years after the 2011 civil war that toppled Gadhafi. Libya's military banned flights Saturday to Benghazi and said in a statement that it would target any military aircraft flying over the city.

"By . Martin Robinson . The BBC has spent almost £30million on hotels for staff in the past three years including one room costing £633-a-night. Despite the corporation promising to cut costs, the bill is up by 32 per cent in the past year, with up front spending for the upcoming World Cup in Brazil and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow blamed. New figures have revealed that in 2011 the total paid out for hotel rooms stood at £8.4million, rising to £8.8million in 2012. But in 2013 it rose to £11.6million, taking the three year total to £28.8million. Big spender: BBC has paid almost £30million for hotel rooms in the past three years, including here at the Art Hotel in Amsterdam . A breakdown of the most expensive rooms reveals that one room booked cost £633 for a night, but on several occasions in excess of £300 a room was spent. But the BBC has refused to name many of the hotels, who stayed in them and for how long. A . BBC source, who asked not to be named, said today: 'It's fair to say . that BBC staff go all over the world, sometimes at short notice, to . cover events, but to pay more than £600-a-night for a hotel room is . taking the mick. 'Most normal people would make do with a basic hotel, like a Premier Inn or Travelodge for a maximum of £100-a-night or so. 'The . simple fact is that it's not your average BBC worker living it up in . these hotels, it's the big bosses or presenters - and that's what makes . everyone a little bit peeved off when we are meant to be cutting back on . expenses.' High price: One BBC staff member stayed in the NH Doelen Hotel in the Dutch capital but the Corporation says it is trying to keep costs down . Favourite: At least one BBC worker stayed at this Hotel Dante in Barcelona on three occasion, costing an average of £400 a night or more . Hotels stayed at include the trendy 84-bedroom Art Hotel in Amsterdam, the NH Doelen Hotel, again in Amsterdam, and the Premier Dante Best Western Hotel in Barcelona. The 'room rate' price paid for the Premier Dante Best Western Hotel in Barcelona by the BBC in 2013 is listed as £400.38, despite the fact that you can book a room at the hotel for £116 today. The 'room rate' paid for a stay at the Art Hotel in Amsterdam by the BBC in 2011 was £254.29, but again, if you were booking a room today it could cost you as little as £121-a-night. In 2012 the BBC paid a 'room rate' of £443.91 of the NH Doelen Hotel in Amsterdam, when you could book a room now for £113 for the night. And in all 30 'top prices' paid for hotels, just one was in the UK - booked in 2013 for £378-a-night. Top 10 hotel 'room rate' prices for 2011, 2012 and 2013 paid for the BBC, revealed in a Freedom of Information request; .

"By . Rupert Steiner . Boots, which is part of the Alliance Boots group, could be taken over by US rival Walgreens in a matter of months . Boots the Chemist may be the next major British born brand to be snapped up by a US giant in a £10.5billion deal. The High Street stalwart, which is part of the Alliance Boots group, could be taken over by rival Walgreens in a matter of months shaving millions off the tax bill of its US suitor. It comes as Britain’s second largest pharmaceuticals firm AstraZeneca is stalked by America’s Pfizer in what could be the largest foreign takeover of a British firm worth some £62.7billion. The ease with which British firms can be taken over by foreign companies has become controversial since Kraft, now called Mondelez snapped up Dairy Milk maker Cadbury. Some workers and politicians feel the playing field is not level with other countries such as America and France operating more protectionist policies. They are also concerned about the commitment to jobs. Boots became Alliance Boots in 2007 when American private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts teamed up with Italian billionaire Stefano Pessina in a £12billion deal. Its tax domicile is in Switzerland. Last year Walgreens bought a 45per cent stake in the firm with the option of buying the reminder from February next year. Investors in Walgreens want it to buy Alliance Boots sooner because of the scale of savings in the tax bill. Walgreens would move its tax domicile to either the UK or Switzerland cutting the rate from 37.5per cent to 20 per cent in a complex transaction known as a ‘tax inversion’. Sources close to the firm said: ‘It’s possible but very unlikely at this stage.’ The source said it would be hard to complete the manoeuvre prior to next February even if it started now anyway. The news comes as Britain's second largest pharmaceuticals firm AstraZeneca is stalked by America¿s Pfizer . Alliance Boots declined to comment. Boots, which can trace its roots back to Nottingham in 1849, started as a herbal medicine shop by John Boot. But it was his son Jesse who grew the business having helped his mother run it from the age of 10 following the death of his father in 1860. Now the retail giant has close to 2,500 stores in the UK along with the No7 beauty range. The wider group operates in more than 25 different countries. It has 108,000 employees and has a wholesale business. Last month it announced it was buying pharmacy chains in Mexico and Chile after long eyeing expansion in emerging markets. It is spending £375million buying Mexico’s Farmacias Benavides and Farmacias Ahumada in Chile.","Major high street retailer is already part-owned by Walgreens .

Mr Ozdil told the Daily Mirror: 'I saw a worker with a belt around his neck as he tried to commit suicide. 'There was gas so I withdrew. I was told some of the workers had hit their heads against walls.' He claimed the gas masks being used by some of his colleagues were not working. He added: 'The masks have to be inspected every six months, but no-one inspects.' Anger continued to surge in the wake of the coal mine inferno in the western town of Soma that has killed at least 298 miners.

In . Istanbul, police forcefully broke up a crowd of about 150 people who lit . candles and lined up mining helmets on the ground to honour the victims . of the disaster, the DHA news agency reported. Energy minister Taner Yildiz said at least 298 people died in Tuesday's tragedy. Another two or three people are believed to be missing underground while 485 miners escaped or were rescued. Flashpoint: Police used tear gas to disperse people who gathered to commemorate the Soma mine accident victims and protest the government's labor policy in Kadikoy, Istanbul . Remembering the dead: Around 150 people lit candles and lined up mining helmets on the ground to honour the victims of the disaster before being forcefully broken up by police . However, other political parties believe that estimate is too low, with one union official claiming the final death toll could be 'more than 400 and possibly as high as 500'. The . government has asked for a parliamentary inquiry into the disaster to . find out what happened and why - but it appeared that officials had . already made up their minds yesterday. 'There's . no negligence with respect to this incident,' insisted Huseyin Celik, a . deputy leader of the ruling party. He said the mine in Soma 'was . inspected vigorously 11 times since 2009'. He added: 'Let's learn from this pain and rectify our mistakes...(But) this is not the time to look for a scapegoat.' Tragedy: A dead miner is carried to an ambulance as efforts continued to retrieve bodies or rescue survivors . Manhandled: Riot police detain a protester as several hundred protest against the government in Soma . Mr Bicak, however, said the last . inspection at the Soma mine was six months before the disaster. He said . the inspectors only visit the top 100 yards of the mine and the managers . knew that. So, the managers would clean up the top part of the mine and the inspectors never saw what was below, he said. The . miner said the pathways are really narrow and steep down below, and the . ceilings are so low miners cannot stand up, adding that is why it was . so hard to get out. But Akin Celik, the Soma mining company's operations manager, echoed the government's argument. 'There's . no negligence with respect to this incident. We all worked with all our . heart and soul. I have not seen anything like this in 20 years,' he . told reporters. The question remains, however, of how the mine could have been checked so often and still have such a deadly fire.

He . says there is a mine accident every three or four months in the Soma . region and eleven workers have died in the last three years. Mine inspections do take place but the owners are tipped off up to a week before, he alleged. Mr . Ozel's party has criticised the government for not adopting the . International Labour Organisation's convention on mine safety, widely . regarded as the industry standard. Joe . Drexler of the Global Union Federation visited Turkey several times . between 2008 and 2010 to urge government officials to ratify the ILO . convention and improve health and safety in the country's mines. Anger: Relatives of the trapped miners protest at the government days after fire knocked out power and shut down the ventilation shafts and elevators, trapping hundreds underground . Up in arms: Anti-government protesters chant slogans on a monument for the town's miners, during a march in Soma where the tragedy happened . 'I have no doubt that this disaster could have been averted if this convention had been accepted,' he said. Funeral prayers were said in mosques throughout Turkey for the victims and football fans draped their team's scarves over some of the graves in Soma.

The disaster could hurt his political ambitions - he has made no secret of his desire to run for president in the country's August election after serving as prime minister for the last 11 years.

"By . Mark Duell . An obese hospice nurse who has had £30,000 of weight-loss operations funded by taxpayers is so addicted to junk food that he liquidises kebabs and burgers to cheat his gastric band. Chris McDonnell, of North London, who even blends deep-fried Mars bars to avoid them making him sick, has put on seven stone in a year - and had his band adjusted last month for the eighth time. The 31-year-old - who has been addicted to eating since he was 12 - revealed his concerns that the addictions of obese patients are often not being addressed, despite them receiving surgery. Obesity problem: Chris McDonnell - who has had £30,000 of weight-loss operations funded by the taxpayer - is so addicted to junk food that he liquidises kebabs and burgers to cheat his gastric band . He told the Sunday Mirror’s Gemma Aldridge: ‘The problem isn’t in your stomach, it’s in your brain.’ Mr McDonnell said of his food addiction since childhood: ‘I did it without thinking. Huge portions four, five times a day, with several courses. Kebabs, pizzas and burgers were my favourites. ‘Kids would point at me in the street and comment to their parents about how big I was. People told me to diet and I tried - but I just loved food too much. It was the most important thing in my life.’ He weighed a whopping 32 stone at the age of 24 - eating 15,000 calories each day, which is six times the recommended amount for an adult male. But it was after struggling to fit into an aeroplane seat on the way home from a family holiday in the Dominican Republic that Mr McDonnell realised he had to do something about his weight. In the past: Mr McDonnell weighed a whopping 32 stone at the age of 24 (left), before dropping to 15 stone following surgery (right). Now, he has gone back up to 22 stone . He had been reading on holiday about . former X Factor judge Sharon Osborne’s gastric band - and went to his GP . to find out more about having an operation, reported the Mirror. Inspiration: Mr McDonnell had been reading about Sharon Osborne's gastric band while on holiday . Mr McDonnell received NHS funding within two weeks for it - which would have cost £9,000 privately - and lost more than half his body weight in the two years following the operation. After making it down to 15 stone, he was given further operations on the NHS to remove his folds of loose skin - which saw the total cost of his surgery hit £30,000. But Mr McDonnell was still addicted to fast food, and found himself vomiting small amounts of kebabs he tried to eat. During a four-year period he gained and lost six stone on two occasions. Doctors have been loosening his gastric band but warning him to stick within a strict diet.

"By . Richard Spillett . The number of armed police officers could drop dramatically due to a watchdog's plans to stop them conferring while writing up reports on shootings, it has been claimed. The Independent Police Complaints Commission wants to make sure all armed police are separated from each other while writing up reports on shootings and the use of tasers. But a leading figure in London's Metropolitan Police says the changes would see about half of armed police refuse to carry arms over fears they'll be 'criminalised' or put on trial for murder. A police chief has warned proposed changes to the way armed police report on shootings could lead to hundreds of officers refusing to carry guns. Pictured: Armed police outside the US Embassy in London . Police are currently given 48 hours after a shooting to produce a statement and can confer about events in the lead up to the incident. But the IPCC want to stop officers conferring and force them to write up their report before they go off duty. Commander Neil Basu, Met Police head of armed policing, says the changes would seriously hit his force's ability to tackle gun crime and place even more pressure on armed officers. He said: 'We remain deeply concerned that the proposals will see officers being treated as suspects, separated from colleagues and questioned at what is always a traumatic and stressful time. 'Rather . than assist an investigation we believe these proposals will greatly . hinder the evidence-gathering process and prevent the best evidence from . being obtained. 'Armed . officers place themselves in harm's way for the good of the public on a . daily basis. They are highly-professional and dedicated individuals who . deserve our support.' He fears more than 50 per cent of the Met . Police's 2,000 armed officers would refuse to carry a weapon if the changes were brought in, and far . fewer officers would apply for the roles. Commander Neil Basu (left), head of armed policing at Scotland Yard, says changes to how police shootings are reported would have a huge impact of tackling gun crime . The IPCC proposals come after the controversy surrounding the death of Mark Duggan, who was shot dead by police in Tottenham, north London in August 2011. His killing led to protests in the area, which turned into the riots which spread across London and Britain that summer. In that case, police officers spent eight hours together preparing their reports on the events leading up to shooting, days after the incident occurred. In January this year, an inquest jury concluded by a majority of eight to two that Mr Duggan was lawfully killed. The jury found unaminously that he had a gun with him in a minicab shortly before he was shot. They found it was more likely than not that he had thrown the weapon just before he was killed. A gun was found about 20 feet from the scene. The IPCC later questioned the police use of a 'hard-stop' tactic in the case, in which suspects are intercepted and confronted by armed officers. Armed police at Heathrow Airport. The IPCC want to stop officers conferring when producing reports about shootings and wants them to complete the paperwork immediately instead of within 48 hours . Lawyers say the proposals could lead officers involved in shootings to refuse to take part in investigations for fear they'll end up on trial for murder. Commander Basu said that the IPCC was protecting its own reputation after a survey found 80 per cent of armed officers lacked confidence in the changes. The same survey found that two thirds of the Met police officers 'would think seriously' about handing in their weapons if the plans changes were approved. The IPCC was accused of mishandling the probe in the so-called 'Plebgate' affair, in which cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell clashed with officers in Downing Street,  and the watchdog was criticised earlier this year over investigations into deaths in custody. But the IPCC's director of investigations, Moir Stewart, has backed the proposals, which would need to be approved by Home Secretary Theresa May before being brought in . Mr Stewart said: 'Separating officers after an incident, as soon as it is practical to do so, allows them to provide their accounts and importantly, and often overlooked, it adds integrity to their accounts and protects them from accusations of a cover up or collusion. 'I believe that explainable inconsistencies are more credible than unexplainable consistencies. 'The proposals we have put forward... will increase public confidence in the police version of events, and help ensure our investigations are as robust and thorough as they can be.'","IPCC have put forward changes to the way shooting reports are prepared .

"By . Sara Smyth . Two women who spent their 94-year-old relative’s money on cars, designer handbags and expensive jewellery have had their cloak of anonymity lifted by a judge. Janet Miller, 72, and Margaret Johnson, 61, from Derbyshire, were not allowed to be named publicly in order to protect their victim Gladys Meek. But now, the women who spent more than £230,000 of Mrs Meek’s savings, have been identified following her death at the age of 94. Shocking: Janet Miller, 72 and Margaret Johnson, 61, from Derbyshire, who spent Gladys Meek's money on watches, jewellery and cash gifts were named at the Court of Protection, sat at the High Court . Mrs Miller, who was a niece of Mrs Meek’s late husband Bert and Mrs Johnson, a great-niece, were given power to manage Mrs Meek’s finances in 2010. At the time it was decided that Mrs Meek’s dementia meant she lacked the mental capacity to make decisions about her estate. But rather than protect her aunt’s savings, Mrs Miller went on to spend £17,000 on an Omega watch, more than £10,000 on rings and treated herself to two Mulberry handbags worth more than £1,000. Named and shamed: Two women who spent their relative's savings on luxuries like a Rolex . She used money from Mrs Meek’s accounts to buy her daughter and granddaughter Vivienne Westwood handbags. Mrs Johnson’s ‘gifts’ to herself included an £18,000 Rolex watch, a £16,000 ring and a £20,000 ‘cash gift’. She also gave her daughters designer handbags and spent £500 on a Derby County football club season ticket for her husband. The two women donated more than £50,000 of Mrs Meek’s money to charities. In 2013, the women were stripped of their power after they were accused of ‘extravagant’ spending Judge David Hodge QC. Judge Hodge made the decision to name the women following the latest in a series of hearings in the Court of Protection - which handles cases relating to sick and vulnerable people. Before Mrs Meek died in April 2014, the court considered whether a police investigation should be called. But rather than have Mrs Meek questioned as part of the investigation, the judge ruled that a £270,000 ‘security bond’ offered by Mrs Miller and Mrs Johnson should be called in instead. Judge Hodge concluded that publication of names would pose no risks to anyone other Mrs Miller and Mrs Johnson. Judge Hodge said: ‘Mrs Miller and Mrs Johnson engaged in a course of conduct involving extravagant gifts, not only to charities, but also to themselves and members of their respective families, and involving the purchase of a motor car for each of them, computers, jewellery, watches, designer handbags and football season tickets, and involving very large transfers of cash.’ He said in April this year records showed that Mrs Meek’s assets to be worth nearly £115,000. But he said more than £90,000 of that could be eaten up in legal costs.","Janet Miller, 72 and Margaret Johnson, 61, spent Gladys Meek's savings .

"By . Dan Bloom . From defiant Vietnam protesters to thronging markets and tube stations, these striking photographs capture 30 years of life in Britain's capital. The lively black and white images were taken by Bob Collins, who gave up his job as a watchmaker in Covent Garden to turn his photography into a life-long passion. He chronicled the rise of Shirley Bassey and Tony Hancock for the ill-fated TV Mirror magazine - until it went bust because only Radio Times had the right to print coveted television listings. All change, please: A Royal Guard marching outside Buckingham Palace during the Changing of the Guard in around 1955. A series of street photographs of London life by Bob Collins, who rose to fame for his depictions of celebrities including singer Shirley Bassey and comedian Tony Hancock, has gone on display at the Museum of London . Familiar sight: Many things have changed in central London since 1960, but some things have remained depressingly similar - including the capital's wet weather . Collection: Children gather around a pile of comics for sale at Romford Market in around 1947. This is one of Mr Collins' earliest works, when he was still a watchmaker . But he continued a dazzling career, much of it spent on London's streets, right up until his death in 2002 aged 78. Born in London's East End, the photojournalist never married or had children and was instead wedded to the job. He captured crowds at the Royal wedding of Charles and Diana alongside street protests against the Vietnam War with the same vibrancy as everyday market scenes near his childhood home of East Ham. Now an exhibition has brought together 50 of his most treasured scenes of London life, including Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park, the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace and the crowds in the evening rush hour. Mr Collins' cousin John Acton worked as his assistant for almost 50 years. The 75-year-old, who now lives in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, told MailOnline: 'His style was strictly candid - he worked best when the subjects didn't realise he was there. Life is a blur: Using techniques ahead of his time such as a slow shutter speeds, the photographer bestowed new depth on scenes like this one in 1960 at Victoria station . Moments in history: Left, clashes at an Oswald Mosley riot in Trafalgar Square between supporters, protestors and the police in around 1960. Sir Oswald Mosley was a leader of the British fascist movement. Right: A photographer peers through the railings at Admiralty Arch the day before the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 . Documentary: The photographer adopted a candid style but occasionally one of his subjects would catch his eye, such as in this photo at Billingsgate fish market . 'He would go around things like the East End markets and do things along the south coast. 'He just picked people at random. He had this kind of eye, you know - he saw something immediately and it would be recorded. He admired the work of Henri Cartier-Bresson and tried to emulate him. 'He took rolls and rolls of film, particularly if he thought something was special. I went to the Royal wedding with him and I spent most of the day just feeding him film. 'He was very much a Londoner so he didn't have to think about where he needed to go. He just had this instinct for street life.' Born in 1924, Mr Collins lasted just days serving in the Second World War when he was called up at the age of 18. Fighting in Anzio, Italy, he stepped on a land mine which almost destroyed his leg and spent six months recovering in a hospital in Rome. Later he would describe the blast to family members as a 'blessing in disguise'. A very English day out: Well-dressed women attending the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club Championships at Wimbledon in 1960 - and all looking at the scores . A day at the races: A spectator reads a newspaper at Epsom Downs Racecourse, Surrey, on Derby Day in around 1960. Mr Collins also took his work outside the city . Another spectator at the racecourse on Derby Day, held every year in June and the highlight of the racing season at Epsom Downs, attracting a varied crowd . When he returned to London, the skyline was changing by the day as historic war-damaged buildings were torn down and high-rise blocks provided new places for city-dwellers to live. While Collins’ portfolio was dominated by . portraiture, from stars of the screen to eminent artists, the new . exhibition shines a light on his documentary . work. The 50 images on display were . selected to show Collins’ observational skills when photographing . within crowded places. Drawn from his days both as an amateur . and later professional photographer, their subjects range from the buzzing West End at night to the . porters of Billingsgate Fish Market – which Collins . photographed over five consecutive mornings, starting at 4am. He recorded crowds at Wimbledon in 1960, central London in the grip of rush . hour and protests against the politics of Oswald Mosley. Swinging Sixties: A couple kissing at a Skiffle Club party in Soho in 1959. The BBC programme of the same name was one of the most pop music radio shows of its day . Beyond the city: Many of Mr Collins' photos were shot beyond the boundaries of London, This image of five pensioners was taken on Brighton Beach in around 1955 . Queuing: Some British traditions will never die. Before the days of automated ticket gates, these crowds huddled towards a single inspector at Victoria station in 1960 . Successful: Bob Collins (pictured) left his job as a watchmaker in Covent Garden in the early 1950s and carved out a successful career as a photojournalist in the capital . The photographs are going on show at the Museum of London, which has an estimated 150,000 photos in a collection built up over the last 102 years. The exhibition will also show the . photographer’s contact sheets for the very first time, shedding light on his methods. Anna Sparham, the museum's curator of photography, said: 'In his documentary photography, Collins . honed the art of successfully detaching a person or telling moment from a . busy scene or making remarkable images of the crowd itself. 'He is an . inspirational figure in London’s 20th century photography, . providing a fabulous visual record of our capital.' Observing the Crowd: Photographs by Bob Collins is free and will run at the Museum of London from Friday, May 16 to Friday, July 13.","Photographer left job as a watchmaker in 1950s to photograph rising stars such as Shirley Bassey and Tony Hancock .

"By . James Chapman . Mr Clegg told colleagues not to lose their nerve ahead of a probably drubbing in elections as rumours swirl of plot against his leadership . Nick Clegg urged Liberal Democrats not to ‘lose their nerve’ yesterday as the party prepared for a drubbing in this week’s European and local elections. With rumours swirling of a plot against his leadership, the Deputy Prime Minister told colleagues it would be ‘highly self-defeating’ to turn inwards just as the Government’s key decisions are being ‘vindicated’. He also snapped at the BBC’s Andrew Marr, accusing him of ‘sneering’ at him for insisting the Lib Dems could form another coalition with the Tories after 2015 despite rising tensions between the two parties. The Lib Dems are braced for humiliating results at the polls this week, with strategists saying that hanging on to just four of their 12 MEPs would be a good result. Candidates were said yesterday to have been shaken by the hostility of many voters towards Mr Clegg. Senior party figures dismiss as fanciful the idea that he could be replaced  by Danny Alexander or Vince Cable, but are preparing for a difficult period if the results are as bad as expected. In several European election polls the party has been languishing in fifth place behind  the Greens. A poll yesterday suggested  that only 46 per cent of Lib Dem voters would want Mr Clegg to stay in his job if the party does end up in that position. One idea that has already been floated in Lib Dem circles, but rejected by his allies, is for Mr Clegg to remain Deputy Prime Minister but relinquish the party leadership, allowing another senior  figure to front next year’s general election campaign. David Cameron and senior Tories, meanwhile, are said to be planning a ‘Save Clegg’ operation that will see the Lib Dems given ‘wins’ in the forthcoming Queen’s Speech. Senior party figures dismiss as fanciful the idea that Clegg could be replaced by Danny Alexander or Vince Cable, pictured, but David Cameron has launched a 'save Clegg' operation ahead of the Queen's Speech . The Deputy Prime Minister said yesterday: ‘Of course it has been tough. We had to take all those difficult decisions to repair and reform the deeply damaged British economy. ‘I am immensely proud that our resilience, our unity – despite endless breathless predictions, which we’re seeing again right now to the contrary – have actually delivered the stability necessary to deliver economic recovery. ‘Sure, there might be individual decisions which people don’t like that this government’s had to take – the Liberal Democrats have had to take. ‘But I think it would be highly self-defeating precisely at the point when our big judgments are being vindicated for us to lose our nerve, and that’s why my party is not going to.’","Deputy PM says it would be 'highly self-defeating' to turn inwards .

"By . Julian Robinson . Former Bond girl Fiona Fullerton has defied her neighbours and cut down two 'iconic' trees outside her mansion - despite being warned felling them would be 'vandalism'. The 57-year-old actress came under fire after she obtained a licence to fell the towering Cypress trees as part of a major renovation of her £900,000 home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. Ms Fullerton says she is just following guidance from council officers who said the 70-year-old trees are unsafe. Workmen cut down cypress trees outside the new home of former Bond girl Fiona Fullerton in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire .

But neighbours believe they should be saved and have accused the Strictly Come Dancing star of putting profit before the community. The huge trees have now been cut down. Sarah Knightly Brown - who has lived alongside the star's home for 30 years - dubbed the trees 'iconic'. She said: 'The greenery of this area is what makes it so special. 'If you look at this road, the old trees are so important to the way it looks. Felling them will change the whole atmosphere. 'A lot of residents feel very strongly about this. We don't want these trees to go. They are iconic and have been there ever since I moved in. 'I think it is a shame for the area, it will look very different without those trees. 'We will notice it more in winter because they were evergreens which came into their own at that time of year. Before: The Cypress trees  as they once looked outside the new home of former Bond girl Fiona Fullerton in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire . After: Workmen have now cut down the trees, even though a neighbour called them 'iconic' 'I just hope they plant something else there in their place.' Peter Swales, chairman of Cheltenham Bridge Club who also lives alongside the property, added: 'Felling these trees basically amounts to vandalism. 'It's just property developers making some cash without a care for the community.'

Pictured left, workmen fell trees outside the property which is being renovated . 'The . tree preservation officer actually asked us if we were going to take . down the trees because they were inappropriate for the area,' Ms . Fullerton said. 'We also took advice from three different tree surgeons and one of the trees is old and unsafe. 'We are just doing what we have been directed to do. 'The trees will be replaced with Holm oaks, fitting in with the ones across the road. If neighbours have any concerns we are happy to talk to them about it.' The former Bond girl, who starred as a KGB spy in 1985 film A View to a Kill alongside Roger Moore, has released books on how to renovate properties to increase their value. But she flatly denied this project was about making a quick buck. She added: 'It's going to be our home. It has been used as offices for the last 60 years but we are bringing it back to residential use. It's a beautiful house.' Fiona Fullerton says the felling came following guidance from council officers who said the 70-year-old trees were unsafe . Lindsey Mulraine, tree officer at Cheltenham Borough Council, said the authority had decided the cypress trees were not worth keeping. 'It is a shame to lose these two trees, but it was felt they were not worthy of a preservation order,' she said. 'We did publicise the proposed works and no objections were received. 'It is felt the trees have reached the end of their useful life but we do hope the applicant continues with intentions to replace them with Holm oaks.'","Fiona Fullerton had trees felled despite neighbours calling it 'vandalism'

"By . Political Correspondent . Tens of thousands of primary pupils are sitting tougher exams brought back by Michael Gove in 2012 . Tens of thousands of 11-year-olds are being stretched by more difficult tests that have been revived by Education Secretary Michael Gove. Only the brightest pupils are expected to pass the tougher versions of Level 6 exams. Labour axed the exams, which test 11-year-olds with material more suitable for 14-year-olds, in 2002 before the Coalition brought them back in 2012 for maths and reading. Last year, the tests were also brought in for grammar, punctuation and spelling. From 2016, the current standard tests for 11-year-olds will be replaced by a compulsory exam which will include many of the harder questions asked in the Level 6 papers. It means all youngsters will be expected to be taught at a higher level to meet the tougher exam requirements. Currently, the Level 6 is optional and teachers tend to test only the most academic pupils with it. But figures released today show that primary schools are increasingly using them to challenge students and raise aspiration. Last year, just 3 per cent – 2,200 out of 70,000 pupils – who sat the reading exam reached a Level 6 pass. Just 8,500 out of 59,000 passed the spelling, punctuation and grammar test (14 per cent) while under half – 35,000 out of 78,000 – passed the maths test. A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We brought back these tests because we wanted to give teachers the chance to set high aspirations for pupils in literacy and numeracy. ‘We want to see every school stretching all their pupils. These figures show that primary schools have embraced the opportunity to stretch their brightest 11-year-olds by  teaching them more demanding new material, in line with the new curriculum, and by entering them for the Level 6 test.’ From 2016, the current standard tests for 11-year-olds will be replaced by a compulsory exam which will include many of the harder questions asked in the Level 6 papers . Mr Gove has said: ‘It is plain wrong to set a ceiling on the talents of the very brightest pupils and let them drift in class. 'Letting teachers offer Level 6 tests means that the most talented children will be fully stretched and start secondary school razor-sharp.’ To achieve a Level 6 in reading, children have to trace an idea, explore different levels of meaning in a text and explain how a writer tries to influence a reader. Those sitting a Level 6 in maths have to convert between fractions, decimals and  percentages, explain number patterns through graphs and algebra and understand formulae for calculating volume and area. To gain a Level 6 in grammar, punctuation and spelling, pupils must use complex  nouns, a range of verb forms and understand subordinate clauses as well as use semi-colons properly.","Level 6 exams test 11-year-olds with material designed for 16-year-olds .

Louis van Gaal dropped the heaviest hint yet that he will appoint compatriot Robin van Persie as captain when he takes over at Manchester United, claiming the pair have a similar outlook on life. The Holland manager has grown close to the striker, who captains his country, and is set to favour him over Wayne Rooney for the skipper’s armband at Old Trafford. Rooney had looked certain to be made permanent captain under David Moyes. VIDEO Scroll down to watch RVP scoring with a sensational volley against Ecuador . Double Dutch: Louis van Gaal (right) sees Robin van Persie as his perfect captain at Manchester United . A sign of things to come? Van Persie (right) poses with Kluivert (left), Louis van Gaal's assistant manager . Class: Holland captain van Persie scored a fantastic volley in their 1-1 draw with Ecuador on Saturday . Van Gaal rarely singles his players out but he gushed about Van Persie after the 30-year-old scored a superb goal in Holland’s 1-1 World Cup warm-up draw with Ecuador. Van Persie was out injured for six weeks towards the end of United’s  disappointing season after suffering a knee injury in their Champions League victory over Olympiacos in March. ‘Even coming from a bad injury, he scores a fantastic, unbelievable goal, just brilliant,’ said Van Gaal about the striker’s 37th-minute equaliser at the Amsterdam ArenA on Saturday. Van Persie is not 100 per cent fit, according to Van Gaal, but looked sharp as he sprinted to meet a superb pass from Feyenoord midfielder Jordy Clasie. He controlled the ball with his chest before volleying past the baseball cap-wearing keeper Maximo Banguera. ‘I was happy with his performance, but he is also a fantastic captain — and that is important, too,’ said Van Gaal. ‘I think you always make a player captain when you have the same morals and philosophy as they do. ‘Not only about football and tactics and what is happening on the pitch but about life as well. ‘We click and I think that’s very important. I believe that Van Persie and Van Gaal share the same philosophy.’ Superb: Van Gaal praised his star striker's scoring record in the year and a half since he took over . Future skiper? Rooney (left) was thought likely to be United's next captain but Van Persie is the new favourite . Worst start: Jefferson Mentero had put Ecuador ahead after nine minutes against van Gaal's Holland team . Van Gaal is expected to be announced as the next Manchester United  manager today, his final rest day before Holland’s World Cup preparation camp begins. He will inherit a squad of players at Old Trafford in which he has had no say but will take the decision of appointing a captain very seriously. He has spoken in the past about the need for him to ‘click with’ and ‘admire’ his chosen leader on the pitch and Van Persie fits that profile most obviously. ‘He is my captain,’ Van Gaal said simply. ‘He’s my top scorer in the one-and-a-half years that he has played under me for the national side.

"By . Lucy Crossley . Apology: Shop girl Elisha Ram, 23, was suspended from her work at Bentalls department store and forced to apologise after she called Chelsea star John Terry 'a pig' A shop assistant was suspended from work and forced to apologise after calling Chelsea defender John Terry 'a pig' and 'a disgrace'. Elisha Ram, 23, was working at a department store concession when the former England captain and his wife Toni walked in - and overheard her telling a colleague 'he is quite good looking in real life - but he's a pig.' A tearful Miss Ram said she was sorry, but the defender demanded to see her manager at Bentalls in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, to complain about her conduct. Miss Ram was then suspended from her job at the store's All Saints concession, pending an investigation by her bosses. Miss Ram said she had greeted Terry, 33, as he walked into the shop on Monday, before turning to her workmate and told them her feelings on the footballer, describing him as a pig. The worried colleague told Miss Ram to be quiet, and she then realised the conversation had been overheard by Mrs Terry, who married the footballer in 2007 after the pair started dating as teenagers. The footballer, who lives in nearby Oxshott, then reportedly marched towards Miss Ram, and told her she should not have called him a pig while his wife was present. 'I said I was really really sorry. Then I just snapped, got defensive and retaliated, saying, 'you're a disgrace,' Miss Ram's friend told The Sun's Andy Crick. Terry then asked to see her the . manager, telling Miss Ram's boss that he wouldn't have commented on Miss . Ram as he did not know her, adding: 'And she doesn't know me to call . her a pig.' According to The Sun, . Miss Ram told a friend that she had made the pig remark after reading . reports which alleged Terry had cheated on his wife, who is mother to . his twin children Georgie John and Summer Rose - who turn eight on . Sunday. Couple: John Terry and his wife Toni overheard Miss Ram saying 'he is quite good looking in real life - but he's a pig' It was claimed . Terry had an affair with the former girlfriend of his then Chelsea . teammate Wayne Bridge, French model Vanessa Perroncel. She . denied having an affair with Terry, who was stripped of the England . captaincy following reports about their relationship in 2010, saying . that the pair were 'friends'. A spokesman from clothing company All Saints said it was not the brand's policy to comment on matters relating to individual staff members. It is understood that senior shop staff sent a formal written apology to Terry, who last week signed a new 12 month deal with Chelsea, taking him to 20 years with the west London club.

"By . Paul Collins . Daniel Sturridge has been relaxing in Miami this week before meeting up with the England squad ahead of the World Cup. The Liverpool striker was named in Roy Hodgson's 23-man squad for the tournament in Brazil and will be crucial if they are to progress into the latter stages. And the 24-year-old, who finished his club season on Sunday, chose to have a break in Florida with his girlfriend - despite England flying over to Miami to play two friendlies in just over a fortnight's time.

Hodgson did make it abundantly clear that he didn't want players taking long-haul flights before the competition. 'If I’m not careful, I will be treating all the players like children and telling them what they can and can’t do in their spare time,' Hodgson said in February. 'But I certainly wouldn’t encourage them to go that far away, no. 'My advice will be if you are going to go away with your family, keep it much closer to home and avoid the very, very long journeys. 'But whether or not I go as far as to say ""if you’ve booked a holiday to Las Vegas, then you can forget a place in my 23"", I’m not sure I’ll go that far.'

Whale watchers caught these colourful displays on camera as the huge mammals spouted RAIN-BLOWS into the air as they blew water from their breathing holes. Making a splash entrance! A whale is seen doing a flip in the Strait of Juan de Fuca in Washington . Rainbow: One whale 'blew' a rainbow out of its spout . Whales were spotted in both Cape Cod and Washington State . The bright sunlight was reflected through the fountain of water, causing a multi-coloured spectrum effect and creating the illusion of a rainbow. The curious whales were captured on film as they swam alongside whale watching cruise boats off the coast of America - in Cape Cod, Massachusetts and Washington State. Randy McConnell captured the incredible sight as the whales cruised in the waters off Cape Cod. Mr McConnell said: 'The rainbow came as a complete surprise. I guess I was just in exactly the right place at the right time as the whales came up for air. Having fun? The whales are seen in the water with a rainbow overhead . Putting on a show! One whale swam close to whale watchers . Magical! The whales delighted the onlookers . 'I love wildlife and I have traveled to many places around the world - but this was probably one of the most magical things I have seen. 'You are able to get very close to them and it seems they are just as curious about us as we are about them.' But while the whales are eager to explore the boats, they pose a danger to the largely endangered creatures who can be harmed by the boat's propellers. Wildlife photographer Sara Shimazu added: 'One of the whales I have photographed is known as ""split fin"" because of the damage to its dorsal fin. 'And although the injury is healed it serves as a permanent reminder that boaters need to be ""whale wise"". 'We need to slow down and stay out of the path of whales so we can continue to experience them and enjoy the beautiful whale rain-blows.'","Whale watchers caught these colorful displays on camera in Cape Cod and Washington State .

"By . Jonathan Veal, Press Association . Rotherham's dream of back-to-back promotions is still alive after they booked their place in the League One play-off final at Wembley by beating Preston 3-1 in a blockbusting semi-final second leg. The Millers, who won automatic promotion from League Two last year, have had a magnificent season but they saved one of their best performances for the most important night and prospered thanks to goals from Wes Thomas, Lee Frecklington and Kieran Agard. Rotherham boss Steve Evans was forced to usher ecstatic fans off the pitch when they ran on before the final whistle, but he could not hold back the jubilant hordes when their place at Wembley was confirmed. Going to Wembley: Kieran Agard celebrates scoring Rotherham's third goal in the play-off win against Preston . Packed out: Rotherham fans staged a pitch invasion at the end of the game . Man of the people: Rotherham's James Tavernier finds leaving the pitch harder than expected . Heroes: Rotherham can gain back-to-back promotions if they beat Leyton Orient at Wembley on May 25 . Party animal: Steve Evans led the Rotherham celebrations in the directors' box . On the edge: Evans is supported as he waves to the Rotherham fans on the pitch below . It was a trademark display of attacking . endeavour, orchestrated by the influential Ben Pringle, which could have . yielded a bigger winning margin but was enough to set up a date at the . home of football with Leyton Orient. Simon . Grayson's men more than played their part in an enthralling clash as . they took the lead early on through Paul Gallagher's free-kick and then . twice hit the woodwork in their attempts to get back into it though Jake . King and Joe Garner. But North End, who were among the pre-season favourites to go up, will now spend a fourth season in League One. The . tie was finely poised after Saturday's 1-1 first leg draw at Deepdale, . but after a cagey opening the visitors seized the advantage in the 16th . minute. Rotherham . defender Kari Arnason needlessly fouled Garner and from the resulting . free-kick 30 yards out Gallagher's dangerous delivery evaded everyone, . creeping into the far corner. However, . the Millers' response was swift and after Arnason should have atoned . for his error almost immediately with a header that was superbly saved . by Declan Rudd, they levelled in the 24th minute. From . a free-kick in a similar position to Preston's Pringle whipped in an . equally delicious centre, which Thomas got a flying header to and it . sailed through the hands of Rudd. That . quick riposte gave the Millers the impetus and again thanks to . Pringle's incisive left foot they took the lead 10 minutes before the . break. The . midfielder, who attracted interest from Reading earlier in the season, . was afforded time and space on the left and sent in a pinpoint delivery . which a late-arriving Frecklington superbly headed in off the post. In front: Preston took the lead early on thanks to Paul Gallagher's goal but were then outclassed . Fightback: Wes Thomas got the hosts back on level terms less than 10 minutes after Preston's opener . Heads in front: Lee Frecklington then scored to put Rotherham 2-1 up before half-time . Game over: Agard made sure of the victory by adding a third goal for Rotherham in the 67th minute . The . game was now completely open and Preston had several chances to claw . themselves level before the break, but Garner and Gallagher both shot . over. And . the Millers' biggest escape came on the stroke of the interval, . goalkeeper Adam Collin left to thank a higher power as he inexplicably . allowed John Welsh's shot to slip through his grasp but he breathed a . huge sigh of relief as it dropped just wide. The . see-saw nature of the clash continued into the second half and Pringle . almost put his side further ahead, but his sweet volley crashed into the . bar while North End's top scorer Garner went close to emulating his . superb first-leg volley with an effort at the back post from Gallagher's . cross which flew over. After . Gallagher wasted a free header from 12 yards the Millers put one foot . on Wembley Way in the 67th minute thanks to Agard's 26th goal of the . season. But . his strike owed much to the creativity of James Tavernier who foraged . down the right, twisted David Buchanan inside and out and rolled the . ball across for Agard to turn into the bottom corner. Preston . did not lie down as they desperately tried to mount a recovery, King's . 35-yard effort clipping a defender on the way through and crashing into . the upright before Garner endured a similar fate, as the Millers did . enough to win. Out of luck: Preston boss Simon Grayson has got teams promoted from League One three times before . Job well done: Rotherham boss Steve Evans contests a decision during his side's win against Preston . Staying put: Preston and Kevin Davies are now resigned to another season in League One .

"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . The most disturbing aspect of the Richard Scudamore sexist email controversy has been the way the whole affair has been swept under the carpet by the Rupert Murdoch empire. The story involving the most powerful figure in English football has been practically ignored or given the slimmest of coverage by Sky and the News International newspapers — despite dominating the agenda elsewhere. Sky’s Premier League packages have been pivotal to their sports business since the formation of the top flight in 1992, while the Sun and the Times became PL partners in the current deal with their digital rights to show clips of goals from 380 matches. Serious: The Premier League have hired a crisis management agency to try and help Richard Scuadamore . And not wanting to jeopardise these relationships with the PL can be the only reason such an important football issue has not received the attention it merited from the Murdoch media. It’s understood the message has come down from on high not to get involved in the Scudamore debate, much to the angst of female staff on Sky Sports News, while those writing about the beleaguered CEO have had their copy spiked. A Sky spokesman made no comment. Quiet: The Times, The Sun and Sky, all part of Rupert Murdoch's empire, have barely covered the Scudamore scandal . It has emerged that Kevin Plumb, head of legal at the Premier League who looks after corporate and commercial affairs, was involved in one of the puerile email exchanges with chief executive Richard Scudamore and DLA Piper lawyer Nick West. It resulted in Scudamore’s now infamous backing of China’s one-child policy to stem ‘female irrationality’. A statement in response to the allegations of a sexist culture at Gloucester Place made by whistleblower Rani Abraham, a temporary personal assistant to Scudamore, stated: ‘The Premier League continues to be fully committed to treating all staff fairly and on merit, regardless of gender.’ However, it will cause more embarrassment to the League that their senior in-house lawyer is involved in the exchanges when DLA Piper have mounted a full investigation into West’s role. ............................................................................................... David Walsh, the award-winning sports journalist responsible for exposing Lance Armstrong, has finally agreed to ghost Kevin Pietersen’s autobiography, to be published by Little, Brown after his confidentiality agreement with the ECB expires in September. Walsh has started work with Pietersen in India, where the underperforming batsman’s Delhi Daredevils are bottom of the IPL. ............................................................................................... Minister for Sport Helen Grant and Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, who never give the impression that sport is high on their DCMS priorities, nevertheless turned up at Wembley for the FA Cup final festivities. So hopefully Grant, who couldn’t name last year’s Cup winners when ambushed for a sports quiz, will be able to identify Arsenal as the 2014 victors when she is inevitably asked the question. Premier League to stand by chief . The Premier League’s audit and remuneration committee, who meet on Monday to recommend to clubs what action to take against chief executive Richard Scudamore, are aware there is little or no appetite among the 20 teams to remove him from office. But the least they can do is to take steps to reform the antiquated governance of the League which has just a two-man board in Scudamore and interim chairman Peter McCormick, one of his shooting pals. Lawyer McCormick was heavily criticised in the FA panel report for the shambolic way he represented Luis Suarez in the Patrice Evra racism case. And it can’t be right that Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck, another member of that shooting party, continues to chair the committee that decides Scudamore’s seven-figure bonuses and salary. Doubt: There are growing concerns whether Scuadamore's friend Bruce Buck should be A and R chairman . The PL clubs last discussed increasing their board four years ago. But when Bolton chairman Phil Gartside recommended bringing in FA chairman Lord Triesman — Scudamore’s arch foe — he found no support. Meanwhile, the League would not disclose who is paying for the expensive services of Milltown Partners, the crisis management agency brought in last week to reinforce the effort to keep Scudamore in office.","News International and Sky have barely covered the sexism scandal involving Richard Scudamore .

"By . Martha Kelner . Follow @@marthakelner . Louis van Gaal is expected to be announced as Manchester United's new manager this week, but what are the salient points to take away from his appointment? Sportsmail's Martha Kelner has been over in Holland this week and talks through five things we are set to learn about the Dutch head coach. Looking ahead: Louis van Gaal is ready to be announced as the new Manchester United manager this week . Press conferences are unlikely to be boring . Louis Van Gaal press conferences are punctuated by extended periods of silence where he stares down his inquisitor, seemingly attempting to unnerve with his steely gaze. At Saturday’s press conference, one Dutch journalist idly asked Van Gaal how he would be spending his two-day break from Holland’s pre-World Cup training camp. ‘I don’t ask you how you are spending your weekend, so why should I tell you?’ the manager snapped back. ‘He always feels like he’s being attacked,’ one Dutch football journalist remarked, ‘so he is constantly on the defensive. He lacks the personal skills of someone like Ruud Gullit. But you’re in for an entertaining season.’ Van Gaal has a stern manner and according to one Dutch journalist who has been reporting on football in the Netherlands for 30 years, his brusqueness extends to his personal life. ‘He has two grown up daughters,’ the journalist said, ‘and they still address him very formally. There is no casual conversation with Louis.’ It's not all smiles: The Holland head coach's press conferences are very rarely boring affairs . Talent: United hotshot James Wilson could be handed a chance under the new boss next season . Youngsters will get their chance . As a former PE teacher, Van Gaal is well-versed in handling young people, although one imagines he was probably the strictest teacher at his school. On Saturday he gave starts to three of the youngest members of his World Cup squad. Van Gaal selected Terence Kongolo, Feyenoord’s 20-year-old defender, to take to Brazil despite him being previously uncapped. PSV Eindhoven’s Memphis Depay, 20, also started and both sparkled at times. Jordy Clasie, Feyenoord’s highly rated 22-year-old playmaker played the superb pass that led to Robin Van Persie’s equaliser. Van Gaal’s trust in youth will come as welcome news to United’s thrusting youngsters, including 18-year-old James Wilson who scored twice on his debut in the 3-1 defeat of Hull City earlier this month. Robin Van Persie will be a Van Gaal favourite . It is obvious simply from observing the way they interact that there is a lot of respect, even warmth, between the pair. Van Persie was among the first to shake Van Gaal’s hand after the final whistle. It was also notable that Van Gaal - who usually refrains from mentioning individual players for plaudits or criticism - singled Van Persie out for praise in the post match press conference. The striker is already very highly regarded by Van Gaal but his exquisitely taken goal to level proceedings at the Amsterdam ArenA will have only enhanced his reputation with the manager. Van Persie will feature prominently in Van Gaal’s plans at Old Trafford. ‘It has been a tough year,’ said Van Persie beforehand. ‘For the first time in my career I won’t be playing in Europe.’ Van Gaal will aim to soften that blow by aiming for the top four or higher next season. Partnership: Robin van Persie shares a special bond with Van Gaal and will be handed major responsibility . He’ll probably be able to devote himself to United sooner than he’d like . Holland have an even tougher ask than England to get to the latter stages of the World Cup after being drawn in the ‘group of death’ with Spain, Chile and Australia. If they come second in the group, they will probably face Brazil on their home soil. They were missing star names Nigel de Jong, Wesley Sneijder, Rafael van der Vaart and Arjen Robben on Saturday night but judging by the lacklustre performance in their absence, a meeting with the hosts would be one step too far. Van Gaal could find himself swapping the sun, sea and sand of Brazil for the charms of Manchester sooner than he would like. Close knit: Patrick Kluivert has flourished as Van Gaal's assistant with the Dutch national team . Dugout demeanour . Van Gaal is not one for patrolling the technical area. He has no obvious affectations, no Fergie-style gum chewing or AVB crouching. But his special notebook was ever-present. ‘I always have it with me in the dug-out and it attracts a lot of remarks,’ Van Gaal has said. ‘For me, it’s an extremely valuable aid, so it’s not important what other people think. First I always jot down the collective mistakes that go against the pre-planned tactics. That’s the most important aspect. Next, I always note down individual mistakes, of course. 'This way I have a logical sequence of aspects about which I can talk to the players during the interval. That’s why I find a list so useful. The chance of forgetting something important is negligible.’ Distinctive: Van Gaal doesn't have a dugout trademark like Andre Villas-Boas but still makes himself heard .","Van Gaal is likely to hand Van Persie a senior role at Old Trafford .

"By . Deni Kirkova .

"By . Mike Dawes . Tillakaratne Dilshan and Kithuruwan Vithanage powered Sri Lanka to a 10-wicket win over Sussex in their Twenty20 tour match as they chased down 127 in just 9.1 overs at Hove. The home side's 126 for seven, anchored by 63 from Matt Machan, was never likely to provide too stiff a task for the world champions but they could not have expected to be blown away in such fashion. Dilshan scored 73 off just 31 balls with 16 fours while Vithanage contributed 52 off 24 deliveries with five sixes. Driving force: Tilakaratne Dilshan hit a magnificent 73 not out from only 31 deliveries at Hove . Easy does it: Kithuruwan Vithanage raises his bat after making 50, as the Sri Lankans swept to victory . Pulling away: Though Sussex's 126 was never enough, England may be concerned about Sri Lanka's form . Up and over: Vithanage smashed five sixes in his 52 not out at a rate of more than two runs per ball . Sussex got off to a brisk start after winning the toss and were 25 without loss after three overs but Luke Wells (11) was the first man to go as he got a leading edge off Lasith Malinga and Dilshan claimed the catch. That brought Michael Yardy to the crease and he helped the Sharks reach a rather pedestrian 60 for one at the halfway stage but he also fell for 11, caught in the deep by Suranga Lakmal off Ajantha Mendis. Rory Hamilton-Brown lasted just three balls before nicking Thisara Perera to Dinesh Chandimal and at that stage Sussex were 67 for three. Ben Brown helped Machan, who brought up his 50 with a huge six, steady the ship but the scoring rate was still slow and the former was gone for 14 in the 17th over. The wicketkeeper was dropped by Lahiru Thirimanne but fell the very next ball when he top-edged Malinga to Sachithra Senanayake. That prompted a late flurry of wickets and Machan's 45-ball effort was ended as he found Lakmal off the bowling of Perera. Big hit: Luke Wells smashed Dinesh Chandimal for a huge six before being removed by Malinga for 11 . Caught out: Ben Brown was caught by Sachitra Senanayake for 14 as the Sussex innings stalled . Danger man: Lasith Malinga took 2-20 in his impressive spell, as Sussex struggled to maintain momentum . Resistance: Matt Machan, who made 63, was the only Sussex batsman to make any sort of impression . Steffan Piolet was then bowled by Lakmal in the final over before Will Beer was run out as Sussex posted a total which always looked chasable. And Sri Lanka wasted no time in setting about their task, with Vithanage launching a six and a four in the first over before Dilshan hit four consecutive boundaries in the second. Two further Dilshan boundaries opened the next and Vithanage clobbered three consecutive big sixes as Sri Lanka reached 63 without loss in just four overs. Dilshan brought up his fifty with a four in a sixth over that cost 16 runs and the boundaries kept coming with the tourists bringing up their 100 inside seven overs. A single in the ninth brought Vithanage his 50 in just 22 balls and Dilshan sealed an emphatic victory with a four soon after.","Dilshan and Vithanage chase down 127 in just 9.1 overs .

"By . Bianca London . She said she was worried she'd lose her shape after honing her already impressive physique on Strictly Come Dancing. But judging by her latest beauty campaign, Abbey Clancy has nothing to worry about. The model and Strictly star shows off her incredible figure as the new face - and body - of Scholl and Veet. No wonder she's proud of them! Abbey Clancy reveals that her legs are her best asset as she showcases them in her new Scholl and Veet campaign . Speaking about her new campaign, which sees her showing off her famous assets to perfection in a 1950s style swimwear shoot, Abbey said: 'I’m excited to be . fronting this campaign for Scholl and Veet. I’ve always thought my legs . were my best asset and then of course as a model and enthusiastic dancer . my feet work very hard for me! 'I feel most confident when I’ve carried . out my beauty basics such as waxing and foot care. It’s not just about . how great your feet and legs look, but how you feel when they are . prepped and ready to bare as soon as the sun comes out. 'Any mum with a full-time job knows that . fitting in time to do even the simple things like going to the gym and . shops can be a struggle, never mind having the time to visit a salon. That’s why products that are quick and easy to use at home are a God-send. 'With such a busy lifestyle and a little . girl to run around after I barely have time to visit a salon for beauty . treatments, so easy-to-use products such as Scholl Express Pedi and . Veet EasyWax help me get long-lasting professional results from home. Dancer's body: 28-year-old Abbey's new campaign sees her showing off her famous assets to perfection in a 1950s style swimwear shoot, as well as a near naked one . She works out: Since leaving Strictly, Abbey has been maintaining a rigorous work-out regime - and it's clearly paying off . 'It’s no wonder women keep their legs and . feet covered up when they feel unprepared to bare their skin, I know I . tend to hide in a pair of skinny jeans and ballet pumps when I’ve . neglected my legs and feet. 'There’s no need to hide away your legs and feet - it’s time to show them . off!' A spokesperson for the brands said: 'We are delighted Abbey is our brand ambassador. As a model, TV presenter and one of the UK’s most photographed women, Abbey always looks impeccable. 'Abby is also down to earth and knows home grooming can produce salon-quality results with no fuss. She is aspirational yet women can relate to her. We hope that together we can encourage more women to feel confident and dare to bare this summer!' Model behaviour: The model and mother-of-one is encouraging women to up their beauty regime ahead of summer . Speaking about her love of summer, Abbey, who has become something of a fashion icon, said: 'I love the beach and spend a lot of time abroad when I get the chance to take time off from work. I love the summer not just for the long days and warm weather but also the fashion. Summer dresses and little shorts are my summer wardrobe-musts .' Since leaving Strictly, Abbey has been maintaining a rigorous work-out regime and was spotted last week throwing herself into . an energetic martial arts session in Liverpool with her sister Elle last week. Emerging . from the studio looking her usual flawless self, the 28-year-old cut a . trim image and showcased her legs as she garnered tips from the . muscle-bound instructor. Abbey has previously admitted to being worried the intense routines on Strictly made her too muscly and masculine. Summer style: Abbey says she loves the summer not just for the long days and warm weather but also the fashion, citing summer dresses and little shorts as her go-to seasonal styles . She told the Huffington Post ahead of the BBC show's final: 'I've got a six-pack and no boobs, I'm turning into a boy. 'I've definitely toned up, I'm obviously not used to doing this much intense exercise. But it feels good, I feel healthy.' Keeping up the fitness drive, Abbey's latest campaign shots, as well as her ones for Ultimo, show she should have no cause for concern over her figure. The model and TV presenter, who is married to footballer Peter Crouch, has taken over as the new face of the lingerie brand from Michael Bublé's wife Luisana Lopilato.

"By . Bianca London . Royal Ascot is one of the most . popular events in the sporting and social calendar, with an annual . attendance of nearly 300,000 people.

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . A new contraption that enables adults to carry children on their shoulders hands-free so they can 'use a cell phone or walk the dog' has sparked a torrent of hilarious reaction. SaddleBaby, priced at $89, features a chest strap and a foam padded seat that fits over the shoulders - the infant is then secured in place with Velcro ankle straps. While product makers tout it as a 'safe and fun way to bond' with children, many commenters have been less enthused about the device, with one humorously writing on Gizmodo: 'Just wait till your kid has to go potty and you can't unstrap him fast enough!' More time to multi-task: A new parenting gadget which enables adults to carry children on their shoulders hands-free so they can 'use a cell phone or walk the dog' has sparked a torrent of hilarious reaction . Another sniped: 'If you need a device to carry your child . on your shoulders then maybe you should not have them up there in the . first place. Seriously, it's not that hard.' A father added in agreement: 'Somehow I managed to haul around my kid on my shoulders with just maybe my shoulders as the ""saddle"".

One remarked that the SaddleBaby appears to be a 'dad-only' piece of kit as the chest strap makes it 'incompatible with female breasts.' But while it's built for the male body, some men said that they would never wear the accessory because it would make them feel like an 'upright-walking pack mule'. However, one parent lauded the invention: 'This is amazing . for me since my kid has a neuromuscular disease and can't walk or hold . his own weight very well.

A promotional video highlights the benefits of giving hands-free shoulder rides. 'In this . busy multi-tasking world that we live in today we need out hands to do . more, hold siblings, bags, dog leashes, cell phones, cameras, water . bottles, you name it,' a voice-over says.

"By . Ted Thornhill . Shoppers at Tesco can now pop in for bread, milk – and an HIV test that takes just one minute to perform. The check-up will be offered from Monday at Tesco Extra in central Slough, with the results ready in just 20 minutes. The scheme is being run by campaign group Thames Valley Positive Support (TVPS), with the aim of ‘normalising’ sexual health tests. Testing times: A charity is running HIV checks at Slough's Tesco Extra (pictured) The free test, which takes place in a private room, is carried out using a mouth swab that is rubbed once along the upper and lower gums. While customers wait for the results, they will be able to talk over any sexual health concerns they have with the practitioner that administers the test. TVPS chief executive Sarah Macadam told Metro: ‘Testing in supermarkets has only ever been offered as a one-off event and not a regular basis. ‘We are extremely pleased that Tesco are so committed to their community’s well-being which is enabling us to bring such an innovation in testing to Slough.’ Concern: There are currently over 100,000 people living with HIV in the UK, according to Public Health England . The charity said that Slough has been targeted because it’s been identified as an HIV ‘hotspot’, with the third-highest rate of infection in the south-east outside London. There are currently over 100,000 people living with HIV in the UK, according to Public Health England. Campaigners are concerned that of these, a fifth do not know that they are carrying the infection. The Terrence Higgins Trust said: ‘People who have HIV but don’t yet know it are far more likely to pass the virus on unwittingly.’ In 2012, 490 people in the UK with HIV died.","Shoppers at Tesco Extra in Slough will be offered a one-minute test .

Across the globe, life expectancies are increasing with the highest male life expectancy being in Iceland - 81 - and the highest female life expectancy being in Japan - 87 . At the top end of the scale, Japanese women have the highest female life expectancy in the world at 87, and Iceland has the highest male life expectancy – 81. The next highest female life expectancies were in Spain (85), Switzerland (85), Singapore (85) and Italy (also 85). After Iceland, the highest male life expectancies were found in Switzerland (80), Australia (80), Israel (80), and Singapore (also 80). In the UK, life expectancy for a boy born in 2012 is 79 and for a girl it is 83. In the U.S. a boy born in 2012 can expect to live to 76 and a girl can expect to reach 81. If all high-income countries are taken together, the average male life expectancy is now 76. This is 16 years more than for a boy born in a low-income country, where life expectancy is now 60. Globally, the leading causes of lost years of life due to premature death are heart disease, lower respiratory infections - such as pneumonia - and strokes . Worldwide, a girl born in 2012 can expect to live to 73 and a boy can expect to live to 68 but life expectancies in low-income countries remain much lower than those in high-income countries . For a girl born in 2012 in a high-income country, life expectancy is 82. For a girl born in a low-income country, the figure is just 63. ‘In high-income countries, much of the gain in life expectancy is due to success in tackling non-communicable diseases [i.e. chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes],’ said Dr Ties Boerma, Director of the Department of Health Statistics and Information Systems at WHO. ‘Fewer men and women are dying before they get to their 60th birthday from heart disease and stroke. ‘Richer countries have become better at monitoring and managing high blood pressure for example.’ Declining tobacco use is also a key factor in helping people live longer in several countries. However, the ‘World Health Statistics 2014’ report shows that the greatest progress was made in low-income countries where average life expectancy increased by nine years between 1990 and 2012. In many low-income countries female life expectancy is still held back by high rates of death during childbirth . And the greatest increases in life expectancy were in Liberia (from 42 years in 1990 to 62 years in 2012), Ethiopia (from 45 to 64 years), the Maldives (58 to 77 years), Cambodia (54 to 72 years), Timor-Leste (50 to 66 years) and Rwanda (48 to 65 years). ‘An important reason why global life expectancy has improved so much is that fewer children are dying before their fifth birthday,’ says Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. ‘But there is still a major rich-poor divide - people in high-income countries continue to have a much better chance of living longer than people in low-income countries.’ The figures also revealed that across the world women live longer than men. In high-income countries they live for an average of six years longer, and in low-income countries they live for an average of three years longer. At the bottom end of the scale, life expectancy for both men and women is still less than 55 years in nine sub-Saharan African countries – Angola, Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lesotho, Mozambique, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. One of the reasons that life expectancies have increased in low-income countries is that infant mortality rates fell significantly between 1990 and 2012 . The WHO figures also revealed that the top three causes of years of life lost due to premature death are coronary heart disease, lower respiratory infections – such as pneumonia – and strokes. However, globally, the greatest causes of death vary. In 22 African countries 70 per cent or more of the years of life lost due to premature death are caused by infectious diseases. In contrast, in 47 mostly high-income countries, non-communicable diseases and injuries cause more than 90 per cent of years lost. These are diseases that cannot be passed between people, such as cancer and heart disease. More than 100 countries are transitioning rapidly towards a greater proportion of deaths from non-communicable diseases and injuries. Most deaths in children under the age of five occur as a result of premature birth. The second highest cause of infant mortality is pneumonia.","A girl born in 2012 can expect to live to 73, a boy can expect to live to 68 .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A seemingly healthy young woman was left paralysed down one side of her body after suffering a major stroke - aged just 20. Elizabeth Ashmore, complained of a headache after Sunday dinner and went to bed and woke the following morning with no feeling down the left side of her body. When she temporarily lost her memory and the ability to even tell the time, doctors declared she had suffered a major stroke. Shock: Elizabeth Ashmore, 20, ended up paralysed down her left side after suffering a stroke . The news was a huge shock to the fit and active student, who doesn't smoke and regularly attended Zumba classes. Elizabeth, . from Canterbury, Kent, was eventually diagnosed with a middle cerebral . artery infarct, which is a blockage of a blood vessel in the brain. It could have been brought on by kidney condition nephritic syndrome, which can cause blood clotting. Three months later Elizabeth, a graphic design student, has returned home after intensive physiotherapy in Kent and Canterbury Hospital. She uses a wheelchair and stick to get around and still has no feeling in her left arm, hand ankle and toes, but is learning how to cope only using her 'good' side. Elizabeth said: 'I'd had a normal day at home on the Sunday but after dinner I had a massive headache I couldn’t get rid of. I went to bed, but couldn’t stop shaking. Support: Elizabeth with her boyfriend, Luke. She was so weak when he came to visit her in hospital that she could only give him the 'thumbs up' sign . 'My mum tried to stand me up, but I collapsed. I didn’t know what was happening. My mouth was drooping and I couldn’t move my left arm at all or lift my leg. 'When I woke up, I was really upset. I didn’t understand where I was and then it hit me that I was paralysed. Currently, almost a third of strokes occur in people under the age of 65, and this figure is set to rise, according to the Stroke Association. Strokes occur when blood flow to the brain is blocked, either through a clot or a bleed. Anything that raises blood pressure increases this risk, so smoking, alcohol consumption and obesity can all increase your risk of stroke., whatever your age. The contraceptive pill can also increase the risk of stroke, particularly if there’s a history of high blood pressure within the family. Pregnancy is another potential risk factor for stroke in young women. 'My boyfriend came to visit and all I could do was a thumbs up sign. I was just staring at him. I also lost my memory - I couldn’t even tell the time, which was scary.' She added: 'It was upsetting because doctors didn’t know if I’d be the same person I was before. 'It was scary and really emotional at first. It’s made me realise how much people take things for granted. I watch people using both hands and it upsets me. You don’t think you’ll lose something so big, so young. 'Everything has changed. I’m starting to come to terms with the fact my hand might not ever work again. 'It’s a case of getting life back to how it was before, but in a different way.' Elizabeth now realises a strange episode when her left arm went numb a month earlier could have been a warning sign - and is campaigning for more awareness of stroke in young people. On January 5 - a month before the stroke - she went to A&E with a numb arm but doctors said it was just a trapped nerve. She said: “At the time, I joked ""imagine if it stopped working"". I never expected it to actually happen. 'The doctors didn’t investigate whether it could be a stroke because of my age. Rehabilitation: Three months later Elizabeth uses a wheelchair and stick to get around and still has no feeling in her left arm, hand ankle and toes. She is learning how to cope only using her 'good' side . 'We think it might have been a warning sign and if doctors had spotted it they could have given me blood thinning drugs. 'I’m not angry with the doctors - there just needs to be much more awareness that strokes can happy to 20 year-olds.' A stroke is a medical emergency - it's essential to recognise the early warning signs and call 999 immediately. A mini-stroke (also known as TIA or transient ischaemic attack) is a sign you may be at major risk of having a stroke. It’s symptoms are the same as a stroke, except that they last for a short amount of time and no longer than 24 hours. There is a very high risk of going on to have a major stroke within the first few days following a mini-stroke, so it’s important to get the right treatment fast, says the Stroke Association. The FAST test can help identify the signs of a mini-stroke: . * FACIAL weakness: Can the person smile? Has their mouth or eye drooped?* ARM weakness: Can the person raise both arms?* SPEECH problems: Can they speak clearly and understand what you say?*TIME to call 999 . Elizabeth hopes to go back to her studies at the University for the Creative Arts in Surrey and as a part-time sales assistant job at Fenwick. 'The nurses were brilliant and the physios and occupational therapists were amazing. 'I was lucky my leg started moving in week three. I never thought I’d have to learn to stand up and walk again.' Around 75 per cent of strokes affect the over 65s, but Elizabeth is keen to raise awareness of the risk to younger people. She added: 'I want people to know the symptoms and get checked out if they show signs of any. 'Don’t assume that just because you’re young, it won’t happen. 'It’s scary to think I nearly died but you just have to get on with it. You learn to not take things for granted. I’m stronger than I was before.' Elizabeth’s boyfriend Luke Elliott, 21, and friend Alexandra Podd, 21, are running 30km in June to raise money for the StrokeAssociation.

"By . Lizzie Parry . A couple whose daughter died six hours after she was born at a midwife-led birthing unit have today warned of the dangers of giving birth away from a major hospital. Rhiannon Davies and Richard Stanton appeared on ITV's This Morning to urge prospective parents to be cautious in the face of the new draft NICE guidelines. The radical shift in NHS policy is set to encourage hundreds of thousands of mothers to give birth in their homes or at stand-alone midwife-led units, away from consultant run labour wards. Their daughter Kate Stanton-Davies died . on March 1, 2009, after suffering a rare condition where blood leaks . from the foetus into the mother during pregnancy. Scroll down for video . Richard Stanton and his wife Rhiannon Davies today urged expectant parents to make informed decisions about where to give birth after their newborn daughter died at six hours old after she was delivered at a midwife-led birth unit 31 miles from the nearest major hospital in March 2009 . Mrs Davies suffered complications in the last month of her pregnancy, which led to a series of hospital trips and various tests. But medics responsible for her care, determined she was suitable to give birth at Ludlow Community Hospital - a rural midwife-led unit - around 40 minutes from the nearest district hospital in Shrewsbury. Just two hours after she was born, Kate's tiny body collapsed and she was flown by air ambulance to Birmingham Heartlands Hospital where she died at 4.05pm the same day. An inquest jury at South Shropshire Coroners' Court unanimously concluded in November 2012 that Kate would have survived had she been delivered elsewhere, and the decision by clinicians to treat Mrs Davies' pregnancy as low risk contributed to Kate's death. Mrs Davies pictured with her daughter Kate moments after she was born in March 2009 . Mrs Davies and her husband Mr Stanton, who married in 2011, said they would urge new parents to ensure they have all the information they need to make the decision about their child's 'most important moment', their birth. Mrs Davies told the show, her pregnancy had been classed as low-risk, leading medics to tell the couple she would give birth at the rural community hospital in Ludlow. She said she was given no choice, adding: 'When you are pregnant you are terrified of giving birth, you are in the hands of clinicians and you listen to absolutely everything they say.' The couple said while they do not want to put people off midwife-led units, which are recommended by the NHS for women who have experienced no complications during pregnancy. But they stressed it is important women have the right to choose. The couple appeared on ITV's This Morning to discuss the new NHS draft guidelines revealed this week, which say new mothers should be encouraged to give birth in midwife-led units and second mothers should be urged to have a homebirth . A radical shift in NHS policy will see hundreds of thousands more women encouraged to give birth at home. Mothers-to-be will be told that unless there is a high risk of complications they do not need a hospital delivery. First-time mothers are to be advised they are just as safe having their baby in a small midwife-led unit as on the labour ward. For most of those having their second child, giving birth at home is as safe as hospital – and far more pleasant – say new draft NHS guidelines revealed this week. Currently, 94 per cent of the 730,000 women who go into labour in England and Wales each year give birth in hospital. Only 2.5 per cent give birth at home with the remainder going to midwife-run centres. Having a baby at home or in a midwife-led centre is far cheaper than having a hospital birth as women do not need a hospital bed. Staffing costs in midwifery units are also lower and they tend to rely less on pain relief or other interventions. Studies have shown a birth at home costs the NHS an average of £1,066, compared with £1,450 at midwife-led centres and £1,631 in hospital. Previously, NHS guidelines said mothers should be free to choose where they gave birth but urged caution over home births for women having their first child. Women will now be advised to give birth outside hospital as long as their pregnancy is considered low risk and they do not suffer from asthma, diabetes, epilepsy or other chronic health conditions. Midwife-led units aim to create a more homely environment and there are typically between four and ten beds and water-birth facilities. They are either stand-alone centres in the community or attached to hospitals. Doctors are summoned only in an emergency. 'I support a woman's right to choose, when you are given the information to make an informed choice,' said Mrs Davies. 'In our case we had no idea what could go wrong, how long it could possibly take to get me or my baby to a centre of care.' The Royal Shrewsbury Hospital was the nearest major hospital to Ludlow, 31 miles away. Mrs Davies said: 'When Kate was born it was noted she was pale and floppy and her temperature reading was hyperthermic. 'She was in respiratory distress, unfortunately it went unrecognised. 'For a prolonged period of time she was suffering oxygen starvation and was brain dead.' Mr Stanton said: 'There was only one qualified clinician, one midwife who was alone. 'The inquest showed she placed Kate, who was in a hyperthermic state, into a cold cot and left her alone.' His wife added: 'She was on her own, I was in another room and Richard had been sent home. 'When the ambulance came they grabbed her and ran, there were no notes, nothing. 'They took her to an air ambulance they had called. The doctor on board had no notes and tried to stabilise her on the ground for some time before they had to leave.' Mr Stanton said he rushed back to the hospital in Ludlow, and got in the car with his wife and parents with no idea which hospital the air ambulance was heading to. He said they knew it was a Birmingham hospital and so headed for the city. But en route his wife collapsed due . to the shock and he had to dial 999. Mrs Davies was taken to a hospital . in Worcester, while he carried on with his parents, desperately calling . hospitals in Birmingham to try and locate Kate. Minutes . later a doctor called him to say he believed he had his daughter, but . said all the information he had was her time of birth and her name . recorded as Rhiannon - that of her mother. The couple said it is vital that parents expecting a child consider how far the nearest hospital and consultant-led team is, before agreeing to give birth at a midwife-led centre . Mr Stanton said: 'We came to this from the perspective of losing Kate. 'It is really important that mothers have . the choice, but we would urge them to be on the side of caution for . what's possibly the most important moment in your child's life - the . birth. 'We go out and we buy the best car seats to cradle them, and the softest linen to wrap them in, to bring them home. 'But mothers should have the opportunity to make choices that should be informed choices. 'With that information should come the times it takes to get to a centre of excellence, a consultant-led unit, a surgery theatre if needed and a paediatric ward. His wife added: 'Ask for it (the information), research it. 'Think long and hard about giving birth in an environment where you are likely to be transferred in (to hospital). 'Forty-five per cent of home births are transferred in to a consultant-led unit. 'Your fall back is the ambulance service and we know that is under-funded. If you need an ambulance and it doesn't come you and your baby could die.' After the inquest, Cathy Smith, head of . midwifery and deputy centre chief for the women and children's centre at . The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, said: 'We will now be . taking the time to reflect on the jury's findings.'","Rhiannon Davies gave birth to Kate at a midwife-led unit at Ludlow Community Hospital in March 2009 .

"By . Lizzie Parry . The parents of a sport-mad 11-year-old today told of their anger after school nurses branded him fat. Alfie Brady, who is 4ft 5ins and 6st, exercises every day taking part in tennis, gymnastics and netball classes. But after a check-up with the school nurses, his father David and step-mother Julie Haydon were sent a letter telling them Alfie is considered 'overweight' and is likely to become an overweight adult. The youngster, who rides his scooter to school everyday and regularly roller blades, said he has been left upset by the label, which his parents have branded 'outrageous'. David Brady, right, is furious after receiving a letter from school nurses telling him his 11-year-old son Alfie, left, is 'overweight' Experts today told MailOnline the BMI measure is a 'waste of time' unless at least three measurements are taken over a set period of time. Tam Fry, chair of the Child Growth Foundation said any BMI measurement must be taken in conjunction with an assessment with a healthcare worker, who can make an informed judgement taking into account a child's lifestyle. 'If . the boy is sporty that immediately tells you he will have more muscle, . which weighs one and a half times as much as fat - and BMI takes no . account of that.' Mr Brady, 41, said: 'To class Alfie as overweight is a disgrace - it’s outrageous. 'He is an active 11-year-old and, due to his gymnastics and other sports he plays, he has a good physique and is quite muscly. He is clearly not overweight.' The health and safety officer from Portishead, near Bristol, added: 'He was a bit bothered by the letter but we reassured him that he was fine and not overweight at all and that the tests didn’t take into account his muscle. 'Luckily Alfie is sensible enough to accept that there is nothing wrong with how he is. But I am angry that my son has been pigeon-holed in this way.' Alfie exercises every day, tkaing part in tennis, gymnastics and netball classes. But when measured by nurses at his school, his BMI - calculated from his height and weight - declared he was 'overweight' and in the 93rd percentile for someone of his age . Tam Fry, . chair of the Child Growth Foundation, said, told MailOnline: 'The thing to remember first . off is that BMI is a waste of time in that all it will do is tell you . how tall, how short, how thin or fat a child is on that given day. 'If . you are to make any kind of judgement about what is appropriate or not . for that individual child, you either have to measure them again in three . to six months or use clinical judgement to determine whether the boy is . normal or overweight. 'If . the boy is sporty, that immediately tells you he will have more muscle . which weighs one and a half times as much as fat, and BMI takes no . account of that. 'When . making a judgement on any individual you have to actually see the . person holistically and know a bit about them, whether they are sporty . or not, or tall for their age. 'It is really important a clinical judgement is made by somebody who knows what they are doing, a healthcare professional. 'Measurements taken at school are sent to parents at home without clinical assessment. 'A . computer inputs the measurements and BMI into a pre-formed letter and . that can annoy parents who know exactly how the child lives, exercises, . eats and their standard of living. 'It is the interaction between the health professional and parents which will achieve a sensible outcome. 'BMI . is a useful measure but only  when taken sequentially, so a curve can . predict the child's growth, and whether it is normal or veering towards . overweight or underweight. And for that you need two, ideally three . measurements.' Alfie was weighed and measured by nurses . from the North Somerset Community Partnership who visited his school, . Trinity Primary in Portishead, near Bristol, two weeks ago. He was measured at 137cm, 39.15kg, putting him in the 93rd percentile for this age. In the letter, the school nursing team said: 'The results suggest that your child is overweight for their age, sex and height. 'If your child is overweight now, they are more likely to grow up to be overweight as an adult. 'This can lead to health problems. You and your child can make simple changes to be more active and eat more healthily.' Alfie, from Portishead, said he was upset by the letter and added: 'My mum and dad told me not to believe what it said. I’m pretty happy with the way I look.' Both Mr Brady and Ms Haydon, 43, are now calling for changes to how the letters are written. Ms Haydon said: 'The letter is written in a blunt way and is quite patronising. 'What concerns us is if this letter was seen by a child who was more impressionable and already had issues with self-esteem and how they looked. 'To be labelled as overweight like this could have a really negative effect on them and lead to problems with eating disorders in the future. 'What happens in your childhood can affect you for the rest of your life. Children these days are under enough pressure without being labelled like this.' The North Somerset Community Partnership - who has sent out letters to thousands of parents across the district - has apologised for any upset the letter may have caused. Fiona Owens, assistant lead for school nursing at NSCP, said: 'The letter was sent as part of the National Child Measurement programme in which all children in reception year and year six have their height and weight checked, unless their parents opt-out. Mr Brady said: 'To class Alfie as overweight is a disgrace - it's outrageous' 'The heights and weights taken are used to calculate a Body Mass Index (BMI). 'The BMI thresholds have four categories, underweight, healthy weight, overweight or very overweight and this falls in line with guidance from the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE). 'Across the country every health provider is asked to provide feedback to parents to try and encourage families to engage with the School Nursing Service. 'They can provide help and support if needed and actively ask parents to get in touch with any concerns. 'This letter was not meant to cause distress or upset and we apologise if this has been the case. 'The School Nursing Service will be contacting Mr Brady direct to discuss this issue further.'","Alfie Brady, who exercises every day, is 4ft 5ins and weighs 6st .

"By . Emma Innes . An elderly woman has spoken out about her eye condition which causes hallucinations - meaning she sees men's faces and tortoises in her home. Retired teacher Joan Dearden, 84, has Charles Bonnet syndrome caused by age-related macular degeneration - which causes loss of central vision. The first hallucination she had was a man at a bus stop who then suddenly disappeared. Joan Dearden, 84, hallucinates and sees things that are not there - including men's faces and tortoises . Since then, she has regularly seen faces and objects - including a man's face who appears above her bed at night, tortoise-like animals running into her fire and even extra beds in her bedroom. Ms Dearden, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, who was head of science at Leeds Girls’ School for 27 years before retiring in 1989, said: ‘I think because I come from a scientific background it has helped me deal with the condition. 'This is because I'm interested in it and want to find out more - as opposed to other people who might say they don't want to know anything about it. ‘And because I've done my research into the condition, I don't find it as scary as someone who doesn't know why they are seeing objects that aren't there. ‘To some people, me seeing a face above my bed at night, or a man in the street who isn't there, might sound terrifying. ‘But because I know what's going on, it's not scary to me. That's why I want to talk about the condition, to raise awareness so that if it happens to other people they aren't scared. ‘As far as I'm aware around half of people with macular degeneration get Charles Bonnet syndrome so there must be a lot of people experiencing these symptoms. Mrs Dearden (pictured in 2002) has age-related macular degeneration and as a result has developed Charles Bonnet syndrome which causes her hallucinations . It is believed the hallucinations occur because the brain responds to the lack of visual stimulation by creating images of things that do not actually exist . ‘Before this condition was diagnosed people must have thought someone who said they saw objects was going crazy. Thank goodness we know what's going on now.’ Until recently, the medical profession assumed it was a short-lived phenomenon which caused no real harm. Charles Bonnet syndrome is a condition common among people who have lost their sight. It causes people who have lost a lot of their vision to see things that are not there. Most people with the condition only see visions for a year to 18 months after losing their sight but many patients find them distressing. The condition is associated with a number of conditions which cause vision loss, including age-related macular degeneration, cataracts and glaucoma. There are thought to be more than 100,000 people with the syndrome in the UK and some research suggests up to 60 per cent of people with serious sight loss develop it. The exact cause is not known but it is thought to be associated with the way the brain deals with a loss of visual stimulation. Some patients see simple shapes and patterns while others see people, animals, landscapes and buildings. There is no cure for Charles Bonnet syndrome but many patients benefit from reassurance that their hallucinations are not caused by dementia or by mental health problems. Souce: RNIB . However, new research by King's College London and published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology, revealed it both lasts longer than previously thought and has more damaging effects. Details were taken from almost 500 people with the condition, including Ms Dearden, who has been affected for more than a decade. Doctors widely assumed the condition lasted only months but eight in ten of those questioned have been affected by hallucinations for more than five years and a third found the experience unpleasant, distressing or negative. Ms Dearden said: ‘The first hallucination I had was when I went to catch a bus. It looked as if there was a man standing by the bus stop, but then he vanished. At first I was really puzzled as to where he went. ‘A couple of years later I started regularly seeing a face that appeared to be just out of reach. I have also seen little animals that look a bit like tortoises running along the carpet, they run up the hearth and into the fire. ‘Then the other day I saw another bed next to my bed with someone sitting on it. As I looked, it seemed to merge into the wall and disappear.’ Ms Dearden’s vision is slowly deteriorating, and she is now unable to drive, read or play her beloved piano. Of those . with Charles Bonnet syndrome, 38 per cent regard hallucinations as . startling, terrifying or frightening when they first occur and 46 per . cent say hallucinations affected their ability to complete daily tasks, . the new research revealed. Age-related . macular degeneration causes a loss of sight and it is believed . hallucinations are the brain's reaction to the loss of visual . stimulation. Ms Dearden (pictured in 1989 when she retired from teaching) says she wants to raise awareness of the condition so that other sufferers know about it and are not scared by the hallucinations . Mrs Dearden said: 'Before this condition was diagnosed people must have thought someone who said they saw objects was going crazy. Thank goodness we know what's going on now' More than half of people with severe sight loss experience hallucinations but many do not tell others for fear they will be seen as mentally ill. Tony Rucinski, chief executive of the Macular Society, said: ‘It is essential that people affected by sight loss are given information about Charles Bonnet syndrome at diagnosis or as soon after as possible. ‘Losing your sight is bad enough without the fear that you have something like dementia as well.’ The Macular Society's helpline is 0300 3030 111. A father-of-two has told how he lives also lives with Charles Bonnet syndrome. Matt Harrison, 42, from Nottinghamshire, says that when he hallucinates he sees cartoon characters. He says has seen giant red and yellow jelly babies on the bus and floating cartoon heads while in meetings at work. Mr Harrison, who is partially sighted, has had the condition for the last four years. He said: ‘I have an inherited condition which started 10 years ago and means I have lost the sight in the centre of both of my eyes. Matt Harrison, who is partially sighted, also suffers from Charles Bonnet syndrome. When he hallucinates he sees images of cartoon characters and colourful jelly babies . ‘The images I see fill that space and the first hallucination I experienced was really strange. ‘It was a green cartoon head with red lips and it just appeared in my vision. ‘But I remembered it from my teaching days, it was an image I used in the classroom back in 1996 and it was obviously stored in my subconscious. ‘Since then I’ve had a series of cartoon skulls, dancing green cartoon figures, what looks like an Indian tapestry and two laughing Tibetan monks. ‘When I saw the Tibetan monks last winter I was on a bus. It was quite inconvenient as I was trying to see my stop and they were in the way. ‘Some of the cartoon figures look a bit like jelly babies - sometimes they can be quite pleasant visions but other times they can be distracting to say the least. ‘It’s not like I see Micky Mouse running around - they are cartoon-like images of people that my own brain has formed in its own weird and wacky way. ‘They aren’t really scary but they can be off-putting. I’ve been in an important meeting when I started hallucinating - I completely lost my trial of thought.’","Joan Dearden has age-related macular degeneration - causes loss of vision .

"By . Sophie Borland . New figures show the NHS is short of 12,500 nursing posts with many hospitals struggling to recruit highly trained, senior staff . Older nurses who have quit the NHS are being urged back onto wards over concerns of desperate staffing shortages. Officials are drawing up plans to try to entice back nurses who left ten or 20 years ago to start families or pursue different careers. New figures show the NHS is short of 12,500 nursing posts with many hospitals struggling to recruit highly trained, senior staff. The push for older nurses comes as critics say modern nursing training creates nurses with degrees who are ‘too posh to wash’ patients - although nursing unions fiercely reject the claim. Concerns have also been raised that nurses with university degrees lack hands-on experience in care as they have spent too much time in the classroom. Health Education England, the body in charge of recruitment, is preparing to launch a campaign to encourage back ex-nurses which is likely to include attractive pay-rates and flexible working. Many of these nurses may not have worked in the NHS for more than 20 years having qualified in the 1980s - without a degree - and subsequently left to start a family. Meanwhile a new report shows that 83 per cent of NHS trusts are short of nurses with the NHS estimated to be down on 12,566 posts over all. A survey by NHS Employers - which represents managers - also shows that on average 1 in 10 posts are vacant at hospitals also at some having more than 100 are empty. Professor Janice Stevens, managing director of Health Education West Midlands, who is overseeing the plans said: ‘Where trusts do have shortages of nurses, it is often those with experience that they need most. ‘Attracting nurses back to practice has the potential to address current shortages. ‘The next phase of our work will involve designing an efficient process to ensure the success of any campaign encouraging nurses to return to practice. ‘Preventing staff leaving is equally important and also requires focus and attention.’ Last week the NHS watchdog NICE recommended that all wards should have a minimum of one nurse for every patient otherwise safety will be put at risk. But unions say this is simply unachievable given the current shortage of nurses. Last week the NHS watchdog NICE recommended that all wards should have a minimum of one nurse for every patient otherwise safety will be put at risk . The NHS Employers report, published yesterday, also revealed that nearly half of hospitals have recruited nurses from abroad in the last 12 months including from Spain, Portugal and India. Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing said: ‘This is further evidence of the crisis in nurse numbers facing the NHS. ‘It is certainly positive that NHS organisations are now acknowledging the need for more nurses, but urgent action must be taken to address the current shortfalls in the nursing workforce. ‘One part of the solution should be to encourage registered nurses who no longer work in the NHS to return to practice. Bringing their skills and experience back to the health service can be a relatively quick and cost-effective means of plugging the gaps in staffing. ‘Such nurses are an invaluable resource for the NHS, but attracting them back into work will require the provision of dedicated support from employers. ‘There needs to be sufficient funding for return to practice programmes and suitable supervision and mentoring processes in place.’ Nurses who have not worked for a certain amount of time have to complete a return to practice course - usually run at universities - to ensure their skills are up to date.","New figures show the NHS is short of 12,500 nursing posts .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A brother and sister claim their elderly mother lay dead in her hospital bed for two hours until they discovered her - because nurses had failed to notice she had passed away. Helen Weldon's body was found cold and with food dried to her mouth at Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham. Anastasia and Jimmy Weldon then faced a 20-minute wait for medical staff to come to their mother's bedside to check her pulse and confirm she had died. Helen Weldon's children found her dead in her bed at Birmingham's Heartlands Hospital . The 85-year-old from Birmingham was admitted to the hospital for a routine check-up after being taken into A&E when she choked on some water. Mrs Weldon, who suffered from dementia, was due to be discharged three days later. But when her children arrived to visit her they realised she was dead. Despite making a complaint to the hospital days after she died, four years on they have never received a response. Ms Weldon, 45, gave up her job in IT at Birmingham City Council to care for her mother at home after she became concerned about the care she had received in a hospital two years previously. She said: 'As soon as I walked through the door and saw my mum I knew something wasn't right. Mrs Weldon (pictured in her early 20s) is thought to have been dead for as much as two hours, her children say . Anastasia and Jimmy Weldon say nurses had failed to notice that their mother was dead . 'I said to my brother - Mum is not OK. She was yellow and her skin was waxy. It was awful. 'She was cold but still had food in her mouth. 'There was a glass of water by the side of her water which had some starch in. 'A doctor had recommended adding it to her drinks to help her swallow more easily. 'But the water in the glass next to her bed had set like wallpaper paste. Mrs Weldon's children say that even when they raised the alarm it took 20 minutes for staff to help them and to confirm that she was dead. Mrs Weldon is pictured with her daughter, Anastasia . 'She must have been lying there for at least two hours for no-one to have noticed. 'She couldn't feed herself - whoever fed her had left as she was and then she couldn't do anything. 'Other staff definitely would have passed her bed in the time that she was lying there dead. 'I approached the staff - they had changed shifts and were standing in a group chatting. 'I told them, ""I don't know how to say this but I've just found my mother dead"". Anastasia and Jimmy Weldon say they complained to the hospital but that they never received a response . 'She just looked at me blankly and said, ""we'll be with you"". 'But . it was 20 minutes before anyone came over. In that time a friend of . mine had managed to drive from Walsall to the hospital to see me because . I was so upset and even she arrived before a nurse. 'It was so insensitive and I want answers. I want to know why my mum was neglected. 'The person responsible for the ward wasn't even around to answer my questions. 'We logged a complaint as soon as we got the death certificate a week later but we never had a response. Just days ago Martyn James says that he also found his mother, Joan James, dead in her bed at the hospital . 'I am still haunted by it. I surround . myself with photos of her in happier times but I can't get rid of the . vision of her lying there dead.' Mr . Weldon, 60, had to pull a curtain round his mother's bed in a bid to . try and preserve her dignity and not distress other patients on the open . ward. A Heartlands . Hospital spokesperson, said: 'We would like to again send our sincerest . condolences and apologies to the Weldon family for the care and . treatment given to Helen Weldon in August 2010. 'This is not the standard of care we aim for and behaviour we expect from our staff. 'We continue to invest in training for our doctors and nurses to ensure we provide the best possible care to all our patients at all times.' Mr James says when he found his mother (pictured with her grandson, Sam) nurses had no idea she had died . Mr Weldon said: 'The nurses just gawped in shock when we told them. 'We knew she was dead and I pulled the curtain round her to give her a bit of dignity. 'But her starched water had gone solid as a rock, so she must have been there for at least two hours. 'That is the lasting image of my mother I have in my head - it's the stuff of nightmares.' The news comes just days after a retired policeman claimed he found his mother dead in a bed at the same hospital. Martyn James, 54, says he found Joan James, 85, 'propped up' and 'cold' when he went to visit her on January 22 last year. He says nurses at the hospital had no idea she had died until he raised the alarm.","Anastasia and Jimmy Weldon found their mother at Heartlands Hospital .

Not so for one U.S. insect expert who decided to allow 1,000 of the creatures to give him a temporary 'tattoo'. Johnny Fedora allowed the bedbugs to feast on his arm in a bid to see what would happen to his skin. Scroll down for video . Johnny Fedora allowed 1,000 bedbugs to feast on his arm in a bid to see what they would do to his skin . Mr Fedora put a rabbit-shaped stencil over an open jar of bedbugs and then put it over his arm . Two hours after the experiment, he had a red, rabbit-shaped mark on his arm where he had been bitten . Mr Fedora placed a stencil of a rabbit over an open jar full of bedbugs. He then placed his arm over the mouth of the jar and allowed the creatures to bite him, io9.com reports. The colony of bedbugs was being kept to train a bed bug sniffing dog - Bob the beagle - to find them in hotel rooms. Mr Fedora said while it was not painful he could feel the bugs biting him. As they were feeding on his arm he could see them in the jar swelling up and turning red as they filled up with his blood. Two hours after the experiment, he was left with a neat red rabbit-shaped mark on his arm. After 24 hours the whole area had turned an angry red and the rabbit was no longer visible. At this point, his arm was also very swollen and itchy. About 24 hours after the experiment, the area was red, swollen and itchy and the rabbit was not visible . Mr Fedora then developed a series of blisters where he had been bitten by the bedbugs . Some 72 hours after the experiment, the rabbit-shape mark had returned and the blisters had gone down . He . then developed a number of blisters which he says are an atypical . response to bedbug bites - he says people who are bitten once or twice . will not usually develop blisters but that having hundreds attack you . can lead to pus-filled lumps. By 72 hours after the experiment, the neat rabbit tattoo had returned. Two weeks later the mark had almost entirely disappeared. Bedbugs are small blood-sucking insects that can live in the cracks and crevices around a bed. They are attracted by body heat and crawl out at night to bite people and feed on their blood. Some people develop no signs of the bites at all while others develop itchy red bumps. They are not dangerous and they do not transmit any human diseases.","Johnny Fedora wanted to discover what the bugs would do to his skin .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . They may look like the spindly mechanical robots from War of the Worlds, but these sculptures are much less menacing. The conceptual structures are designed as a way of ‘reclaiming’ Beirut’s shoreline for locals who could use them to harvest electricity and as ‘look outs’. Designed to look like an eye, the ‘Iris’ sculptures would open and shut like an eye to provide shelter and would be connected to a buoy in the sea to harvest electricity, if they are ever built.

In this way, the sculpture would blink with the rhythm of the sea. The concepts were designed by Najjar & Najjar Architects, which has an office in the Lebanese capital. The architects said that the sculptures connect ‘the dense city and the open sea’ and that ‘waves transform the kinematic structure into an experience of place and to harvest energy for the fishermen community’. Separated at birth? The three-legged spindly sculptures look a little similar to the martians in H.G.

"By . Mark Prigg . Researchers have warned that young women are becoming increasingly rare in rural communities in America's Great Plains. They say many rural communities hard hit by decades of population declines, young men increasingly outnumber young women. The study of Kansas and Nebraska census data shows in places with 800 or fewer residents, the proportion of young men increased by an average of nearly 40 percent as people went from their teens to their 20s. Researchers say many rural communities don't often provide the same opportunity to women - who never return after going to college . Researchers used the 2000 census to calculate the ratio of boys to girls aged 12 to 17 in more than 2,200 Nebraska and Kansas cities, towns and townships. They then compared that figure to the ratio of men to women aged 22 to 27 in the 2010 census. they chose those age ranges to establish a roughly high-school-aged population cohort in 2000 and to take a second look at it in 2010 -- a time span allowing for completion of college and establishing a household. Those findings suggest leaders should consider the needs of young women in economic and community development plans, said Robert Shepard, a University of Nebraska-Lincoln doctoral candidate who conducted the peer-reviewed research. His study results were published in April's Great Plains Research journal. 'The whole point of this study was to look at it quantitatively, to see if the numbers bear out this story of younger people leaving and not coming back,' he said. My study was important in helping to substantiate that this is a problem associated with gender.' Examining census data from 2000 and 2010, Shepard found that more than half of 1,627 villages, rural townships, precincts and other locales with 800 or fewer people experienced an increased ratio of young men to young women. The median increase was just under 7 percent, but many of the smallest communities saw extreme increases -- in excess of 200 percent -- in the proportion of males to females. 'The big implication here is that if these ratios don't trend back toward equilibrium, there is some concern about the long-term population stability of those areas,'Shephard said. He wanted to learn whether young women were staying in rural areas or returning home after college at the same rates as young men. 'There is a lot of awareness that younger people are leaving rural communities,' Shepard said. 'Where some of the men can come back, because there are a lot of traditionally male jobs like agriculture and industry to return to, many rural communities don't often provide the same opportunity to women. 'As long as that imbalance is there, it's going to limit the development or growth of that age group.' The study of Kansas and Nebraska census data shows in places with 800 or fewer residents, the proportion of young men increased by an average of nearly 40 percent as people went from their teens to their 20s. He found no previous research that evaluated migration patterns of his target group, young adults who would be starting families. Shepard found a growing proportion of young women in urban areas during the post-college years. Major cities and suburbs, including Omaha and Kansas City, Kan., had nearly equal ratios of males and females in the 22-to-27 age group. In several others, including Topeka, Kan., and Scottsbluff, women outnumbered men in their age group. College may be a significant reason why many young women leave rural communities, Shepard said. As of 2000, women comprised 56 percent of 25- to 29-year-olds with at least four years of higher education. Social and economic reasons often prevent college graduates from returning home -- they may have formed bonds with new people or the rural job market may be unfavorable. In previous studies exploring women's attitudes toward the rural Great Plains, some women reported limited job opportunities, while others described a patriarchal culture in some rural communities. In some communities, young men left in greater numbers than young women -- but the ratio of males to females still increased. That's because the number of women in that community already was small. Blaine township in Clay County, Kan., for example, lost 11 of 19 males and 9 of 11 females from 2000 to 2010. Its ratio of males to females in the cohort changed from less than two men for every woman to four men for every woman.","In rural communities young men increasingly outnumber young women .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . These stunning images were captured in the blink of an eye - literally. Former engineer-turned-photographer Alexander Augusteijn used a high-speed camera to record the moment a gun fires a bullet straight through the heart of a falling water droplet. The whole process took just 28 milliseconds, from the moment the gun was fired to the time the shot was taken - and the shot was perfectly engineered to make the image as precise and uniform as possible. This image was taken by 56-year-old Dutch photographer Alexander Augusteijn. It captures the moment a bullet passes through three drops of water, filmed using different coloured lights. The image was shot using a high-speed camera and shutter that was automatically triggered when the gun was fired . Augusteijn’s droplet shots are part of a range of photographs that capture bullets travelling through objects. The 56-year-old has previously caught the moment a bullet breaks a water balloon, smashes through a lit lightbulb and destroys a stack of dice. To take such precise shots, Augusteijn’s uses a pool of water that is lit from various angles, with coloured lights used to add hues to the drops. He begins by placing water in a time-release valve above a pool of water below. As the drop leaves the valve it hits the pool. When this drop reaches a certain point, the gun is set to fire automatically, which in turn triggers the camera’s flash and shutter. The former engineer built the system himself and the whole process takes just 28 milliseconds from the moment the gun is fired to the time the shot is taken. As a result each shot is perfectly engineered to make the images as precise and uniform as possible. The reflection also creates a mirror effect . To take such precise shots, Augusteijn's uses a pool of water that is lit from various angles, with coloured lights used to add hues to the drops. He begins by placing water in a time-release valve above a pool of water below. As the drop leaves the valve it hits the pool . Augusteijn told Mashable that the system takes ‘a few hours’ to setup, but once constructed each shot is ‘spot on, due to the precise level of control.’ But, despite this level of control, Augusteijn takes hundreds of images on any given experiment before selecting his favourites. Augusteijn took up photography in 1976 and mostly shot black and white images which he developed and printed himself. He has also captured microscopic images of crystals, from sugar to paracetamol and Vitamin C, and created images of women and animals using smoke. More of Augusteijn's photographs can be viewed on his website. When the drop reaches a certain point, the gun is set to fire automatically, which in turn triggers the camera's flash and shutter.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . No matter which stars or on show or which teams are competing, one thing will stay constant at this year’s World Cup - the ball. Unveiled by adidas a few months ago, the so-called ‘Brazuca’ is the official ball of Brazil 2014 and it’s the 12th ball adidas have made for the World Cup. And now the science inside the ball has been revealed to show how the best players in the world will have the best technology in the world on the pitch. The science behind adidas's football for this World Cup has been revealed. The ball is known as the 'Brazuca' (pictured) and it is apparently a big improvement from the last World Cup. It has longer and deeper seams to make it less volatile in the air and that means it will travel further and more accurately during games . Adidas came under fire at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa as the ball used at that tournament, the Jabulani, was criticised for its unpredictability. The Brazuca ball has six polyurethane panels that are bonded to keep the ball the same weight and roundness in even the heaviest of rain. The never-before-seen panel shape revolutionizes the game by producing faster flight speed and maintaining true roundness. The bladder of the Brazuca ball is made of latex and provides the desired rebound. The ball is textured and feels more like the adidas’ Finale 13, the official UEFA Champions League ball, than the adidas Jabulani used in South Africa four years ago. The adidas Brazuca ball, in a bold white/night blue/multicolor colorway befitting Brazil, is the most colorful ever for a FIFA World Cup. The sports giant claims the Brazuca, though, will have vastly improved touch and accuracy.‘We do extensive flight path analysis and the results have shown constant and predictable paths with deviations hardly recognisable,’ Matthias Mecking, Adidas football director, told the BBC. The ball itself weighs 437 grams (0.96 pounds) and it has a water absorption rate of just 0.2%, meaning it can retain its shape, size and weight even in the rain. It is created by six propeller-shaped polyurethane panels being themally bonded together. Between the seams the Brazuca also has a different geometry to different balls, helping it remain more stable in the air.‘The most important thing on the soccer ball is how much roughness you have,’ Dr Rabi Mehta, an aerodynamics expert at Nasa’s Ames Research Center in California, told the BBC. Smoother balls, as seen with the previous Jabulani, are more unpredictable due to a process known as ‘knuckling’. As air passes over the seams it can create a force that knocks or moves the ball. The Brazuca, with its multiple seams and roughness, will be less prone to the ‘volatile swoops’ of the Jabulani. ‘The smoother you make the ball, the higher the speed at which it knuckles,’ says Dr Mehta. ‘In essence what happened in my opinion is that with the traditional ball, the critical speed at which you got maximum knuckling was lower than the typical kicking speed in World Cup soccer. ‘By making the ball smoother, that critical speed went up and happened to coincide with the typical kicking speeds, about 50 to 55 miles (80 to 88 kilometres) per hour, especially in free kick situations.’ This year’s rougher ball brings us ‘back to square one’ says Dr Mehta. The ball itself weighs 437 grams (0.96 pounds) and it has a water absorption rate of just 0.2%, meaning it can retain its shape, size and weight even in the rain. Its circumference is 27.2 inches (69 centimetres) and it has a rebound rate from the ground of 55.5 inches (141 cenitimetres) The Brazuca is set to be one of the most aerodynamic balls used at a World Cup in recent memory. Its deep and long seams, seen here, ensure that it won't move unpredictably in the air . Another way the Brazuca has been improved over the Jabulani from four years ago is the depth of the seams. The Brazuca’s are about 0.06 inches (1.56 millimetres), compared to just 0.02 inches (0.48 millimetres) for the Jabulani, about three times shallower. The total length of the seams on the Brazuca are also longer, at 128.7 inches (327 centimetres) compared to 79.92 inches (203 centimetres) on the Jabulani . All of this combines to make the ball rougher, and it also travels further – like dimples on a golf ball, the seams disrupt the flow of air. ‘This agitation is essential for fast and reliable flight,’ Dr Simon Choppin, a research fellow at the Centre for Sports Engineering Research at Sheffield Hallam University. ‘A perfectly smooth ball experiences large amounts of drag and high aerodynamic forces. ‘The seams of a football disturb the flow of the air. ‘This results in a smaller wake-area of low pressure - behind the ball - reducing the pressure difference and reducing the force, which slows the ball down. The lower drag force means the ball travels for a longer distance.’ The result is that the ball should more closely resemble traditional 32-panelled balls that most footballers are used to. Despite this ball having just six panels, the deep and long seams will create one of the most advanced footballs yet used at a World Cup. ‘I am pretty sure the Brazuca is going to behave more like the traditional 32-panel internally stitched ball, so the complaints we got in the last two World Cups will be minimised,’ says Mehta.","Adidas has unveiled how the Brazuca has been improved for the players .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Killer robots may seem like a dramatic term taken straight from a science fiction film such as The Terminator, but the technology is very real. And the threat it poses is so serious, the United Nations is holding a summit this week to debate the future of Lethal Autonomous Weapons (LAWS). Discussions will include the rise of technological developments, the legal challenges LAWS cause, as well as the ethical and sociological implications. The United Nations is holding a summit to debate the future of Lethal Autonomous Weapons (LAWS), or 'killer robots'. Stock image from Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is pictured. Discussions will include technological developments, the legal challenges, as well as the ethical and sociological implications . Reports earlier this week claimed the U.S. military is seeking to build a robot capable of moral reasoning with a $7.5 million grant from the Office of Naval Research. The grant, given over five years to researchers from Tufts, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Brown, Yale and Georgetown, will be used to explore how to build an autonomous robot with a sense of right and wrong. 'Even though today’s unmanned systems are ‘dumb’ in comparison to a human counterpart, strides are being made quickly to incorporate more automation at a faster pace than we’ve seen before,' said Paul Bello, director of the cognitive science program at the Office of Naval Research. But, research from University of Wisconsin-Madison has found robots are incpable of having feelings and developing rational thinking. Using mathematical model of how our brains create consciousness, they claim emotional machines will never exist. This is because computers can't handle any process that completely integrates information, so they cannot be conscious and capable of feeling, an expert claimed. Member states and officials will also focus on the deployment of autonomous weapons, and the possible impact on military operations. The conference is called the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) Meeting of Experts on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems. The purpose of the convention is to ban or restrict the use of specific types of weapons that 'are considered to cause unnecessary or unjustifiable suffering to combatants or to affect civilians indiscriminately.' Michael Møller, Acting Director-General of the United Nations Office at Geneva said to conference members 'have the opportunity to take pre-emptive action and ensure that the ultimate decision to end life remains firmly under human control.’ Ambassador Jean-Hugues Simon-Michel of France, who is chairing the four-day meeting, added: ‘Lethal autonomous weapons systems are a challenging emerging issue on the disarmament agenda right now.’ The outcomes of the Geneva discussions will be submitted to the formal conference of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons in November 2014, where states will discuss possible next steps on autonomous weapons. The purpose of the convention is to ban or restrict the use of specific types of weapons. Michael Moller, Acting Director-General of the UN Office at Geneva, pictured, said conference members 'have the opportunity to take pre-emptive action and ensure the ultimate decision to end life remains firmly under human control' The discussions are supported by a report issued earlier this week by the Human Rights Watch. It claims killer robots ‘jeopardise basic human rights, whether used in wartime or for law enforcement’ and is demanding they are kept out of policing. This follows comments made by the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in his report on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict issued in November 2013. He said important questions have been raised as to the ability of such systems to operate in accordance with international humanitarian and human rights law. The discussions are supported by a report issued earlier this week by the Human Rights Watch. The Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, pictured in London, claims killer robots 'jeopardise basic human rights, whether used in wartime or for law enforcement' and is demanding they are kept out of policing . ‘Although autonomous weapons systems have not yet been deployed and the extent of their development as a military technology remains unclear, discussion of such questions must begin immediately and not once the technology has been developed and proliferated,’ said Ki-Moon. While noting the Meeting of Experts was only a first step towards addressing lethal autonomous weapons, Acting Director-General Møeller urged the delegates gathered in Geneva to take bold action. ‘All too often international law only responds to atrocities and suffering once it has happened,' Mr. Moeller said and noted that Geneva has had ‘a historical record that is second to none for achieving results in disarmament and international humanitarian law negotiations.’","The United Nations is debating Lethal Autonomous Weapons (LAWS)

Lenticular printing is a way of producing images that give an illusion of depth. The images are printed onto strips of plastic on cards. As the cards are moved in a person’s hand, the photos appear to change or move; known as a 'hologram effect.' The Moju app, developed by Mok Oh in California, uses a similar principle to create its animated images. For each Moju, the user takes up to 24 shots of an object or landscape from different angles. These shots, when taken in succession, are stitched together to form the single, finished image. As . the user twists the phone in their hand, the app rotates through each . image from left to right to make the object appear to move in 3D.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Following the mysterious disappearance of Malaysia flight MH370 in March, a satellite firm is now going to track flights free of charge to prevent such a disaster happening again. A total of 11,000 commercial passenger planes will be monitored and followed by London-based Inmarsat – the firm that helped reveal the last position of MH370 in March. In addition, the firm will also provide a ‘position reporting’ tool in case flights veer off track, and a so-called ‘black box in the cloud’ to track real-time data remotely. Inmarsat's technology, pictured, helped reveal the last position of missing flight MH370 in March, and now the London-based firm is offering free tracking to 11,000 commercial passenger planes. In addition to free tracking, the company is also offering a 'black box in the cloud' that will store historic and real-time flight data . On . board a plane there are cockpit voice and flight data recorders – the . ‘black boxes’ – which each include a ‘pinger’ that sends a transmission . up to 30 days after submersion underwater. In . the black box is an ASD-B flight transponder which, unlike the GPS in a . car, broadcasts its location by sending information back to air traffic . controllers every second. Crews are also able to speak to their airline through discrete radio channels. The cockpit voice recorders can additionally reveal conversations and other sounds to hint at problems that may have occurred during the flight. This remote black box is triggered automatically if the plane deviates off course, or communication is lost. and also sends historic recordings to a team of experts. Inmarsat’s service additionally streams cockpit voice recordings. This service is being offered to planes which are already equipped with an Inmarsat satellite connection, which the firm claims is ‘virtually 100 per cent of the world’s long haul commercial fleet’. The London-based company made the announcement ahead of an International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) conference in Montreal, Canada today. Analysis of data from Inmarsat and the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch in March showed the Malaysian Airlines plane crashed in the southern Indian Ocean. Rupert Pearce, chief executive of . Inmarsat, said: ‘We welcome and strongly support ICAO's decision to . place the delivery of next-generation aviation safety services at the . heart of the industry's agenda at its meeting on 12 May. ‘Inmarsat . has been providing global aviation safety services for over 20 years . and we are confident that the proposals we have presented to ICAO and . IATA (International Air Transport Association) represent a major . contribution to enhancing aviation safety services on a global basis. Inmarsat's remote black box is triggered automatically if the plane deviates off course, or communication is lost, and also sends historic recordings to a team of experts. The service additionally streams cockpit voice recordings. This graphic reveals how plane tracking technology works . The service is being offered to 11,000 planes already equipped with an Inmarsat satellite connection, stock image of a Boeing 777 cockpit is pictured. The firm claims the service will cover 'virtually 100 per cent of the world's long haul commercial fleet' ‘In the wake of the loss of MH370, we believe this is simply the right thing to do. ‘Because of the universal nature of existing Inmarsat aviation services, our proposals can be implemented right away on all ocean-going commercial aircraft using equipment that is already installed.' Flight MH370 vanished on 8 March with 239 people on board, during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Evidence revealed on 15 March by the Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak suggested the jet was deliberately diverted by someone on board. Five days later, Australian search teams announced they were investigating two objects spotted on satellite images in the southern Indian Ocean. On 24 March, Razak said analysis of satellite data - by Inmarsat - confirmed the plane went down in the Indian Ocean. More debris was spotted on 28 March. The latest update, at the start of last month, claimed to have detected ultrasonic signals from the plane's black box. Two months on, the plane has still not been found and an update on the search efforts is expected on Wednesday.","Inmarsat helped reveal the last position of missing flight MH370 in March .

"By . Mark Prigg . Apple and Google's Motorola Mobility unit have agreed to settle all patent litigation between them over smartphone technology, ending one of the highest profile lawsuits in technology. In a joint statement on Friday, the companies said the settlement does not include a cross licence to their respective patents. The deal ends between Apple and Google's Motorola Mobility one of the highest profile lawsuits in technology. Apple and Google have both been sued nearly 200 times in the last five years by businesses that exist solely to file patent lawsuits. Apple last year was the top target for patent lawsuits, and Google was among the top three. To combat trolls, both companies earlier this year asked the Supreme Court to make it easier to collect lawyers’ fees from patent holders who lose frivolous patent suits. Now, the firms plans to work together to bring about patent reform. 'Apple and Google have also agreed to work together in some areas of patent reform,' the statement said. Apple and companies that make phones using Google's Android software have filed dozens of such lawsuits against each other around the world to protect their technology. Apple argued that Android phones that use Google software copy its iPhones. The two companies informed a federal appeals court in Washington that the cases should be dismissed, according to filings on Friday. However, the deal does not appear to apply to Apple's litigation against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, as no dismissal notices were filed in those cases. However, patent expert Florian Mueller says the deal could mean an end to that dispute is also in sight. 'At first sight one would assume that this Apple-Google agreement makes a near-term Apple-Samsung settlement much more likely, but this depends on whether Apple's decision-makers have fully realised just how non-thermonuclear their patent portfolio is,' he wrote. He also believes the settlement was due to both sides realising they were unlikely to win outright. 'The parties have entered into a second-class settlement from a position of mutual weakness. 'They had to recognise that under the procedural circumstances their patents were not strong enough to give either party decisive leverage over the other, at least not anytime soon.' The most high-profile case between Apple and Motorola began in 2010. Motorola accused Apple of infringing several patents, including one essential to how mobile phones operate on a 3G network, while Apple said Motorola violated its patents to certain smartphone features. Motorola, owned by Google, accused Apple of infringing several patents, including one essential to how cell phones operate on a 3G network, while Apple said Motorola violated its patents to certain smartphone features. The cases were consolidated in a Chicago federal court. However, Judge Richard Posner dismissed it in 2012 shortly before trial, saying neither company had sufficient evidence to prove its case. Last month, the appeals court gave the iPhone manufacturer another chance to win a sales ban against its competitor. Google acquired Motorola Mobility in 2012 for $12.5 billion, and this year announced was selling Motorola Mobility's handset business to Lenovo, while keeping the vast majority of the patents.","Google's Motorola accused Apple of infringing several patents, including one essential to how mobile phones operate on a 3G network .

The rising waters have also triggered more than 2,000 landslides across Bosnia and Serbia and, though the worst of the rain has ceased, more deaths are feared. The floods came after three months of rain fell in only three days, laying waste to entire villages and disturbing land mines that have been left over from the region’s conflict in the 1990s.

"By . Margot Peppers . A devastated mother has described how her 16-year-old daughter has transformed from a straight-A student and beauty queen into an uncontrollable delinquent. In an episode of Dr Phil that aired on Thursday, Stephanie reveals that her daughter Ashley has become dangerously unruly; she has been caught shoplifting, abusing drugs and alcohol and even stole her car when she was just 12. But the TV host has words for both daughter and mother, admonishing Stephanie for being light on discipline and thereby enabling Ashley to treat her without respect. Scroll down for video . Good girl gone bad: In a recent episode of Dr Phil, mother Stephanie expresses her concern for her daughter Ashley, 16, (pictured), who has transformed from a straight-A student to a teenage delinquent . Scary behavior: Stephanie reveals that when Ashley doesn't get her way, she becomes violent, screaming, punching holes in walls, kicking out car windshields and threatening to kill her . In the episode, Stephanie reveals that when Ashley doesn't get her way, she becomes violent, screaming, punching holes in walls, kicking out car windshields and threatening to kill her. To make matters even more dire, she recently discovered a gun in her daughter's car, which Ashley claimed belonged to a former boyfriend, who was 21 years old. 'You're afraid she could hurt you, she could kill you in a fit of rage,' Dr Phil says to Stephanie as he encourages her to be a more involved parent. 'Now, she's armed.' And the bad behavior doesn't stop there; Ashley admits to having unprotected sex starting at age 14 and has been caught multiple times with marijuana, failing a drug test only a month ago. Transformation: Ashley was a beauty queen when she was younger (pictured), but recently she has been caught shoplifting, abusing drugs and alcohol and even stole her mom's car when she was 12 . Shifting the blame: 'So don't act like this is all my fault - you let me get away with it for too long,' Ashley, who has been known to be manipulative, tells her mother . What's more, she even broke the rules set out by Dr Phil producers, who asked her to stay in a hotel with her mother throughout the duration of filming. Instead, she went to stay with her boyfriend. 'You didn't respect our rules and guidelines either, did you?' Dr Phil asks her. 'I guess not,' she says coolly. 'Don't act like this is all my fault - you let me get away with it for too long' But the TV host points out that her behavior is just as much a product of her upbringing as it is a part of her personality. Calling Stephanie a 'doormat' for her daughter, Dr Phil says she needs to change her attitude or risk being abused by Ashley forever. 'OK, here's rule number one: Remember this for the rest of your life: You do not reward bad behavior,' he tells her. 'Because behaviors that get rewards tend to repeat.' And even Ashley herself recognizes that her mother's submissive attitude is partially to blame for her own belligerence. Time to change: Dr Phil agrees that Stephanie needs to become a stricter parent. 'You do not reward bad behavior,' he tells her. 'Because behaviors that get rewards tend to repeat' Progress: Dr Phil offers Stephanie an opportunity to send her daughter to a treatment center which specializes in troubled teens, and she accepts . 'You know whenever I used to hang out with my old friends, I would tell you I was going to a party, and you wouldn't say anything about it,' she says. 'So don't act like this is all my fault - you let me get away with it for too long.' The teenager adds that her estranged father's abusive nature was an added difficulty growing up, and that she fears she has inherited his bipolar disorder. At the end of the episode, Dr Phil tells the mother-daughter pair that a 'structured environment' is the only setting that can whip Ashley into shape. 'She is going to wind up 17, pregnant, and you're going to be raising the child while she's going out and partying,' he warns Stephanie. 'That's where you're headed, unless you have the backbone to say, ""This stops here. This stops now.""' He offers Stephanie an opportunity to send her daughter to a treatment center called Center for Discovery, which specializes in troubled teens. After some hesitation, she finally accepts.","Stephanie's daughter Ashley has been caught shoplifting and abusing drugs and alcohol, and she even stole her mother's car at age 12 ."
"By . Kieran Corcoran . They say a man forms a special bond with his first car - and one man pensioner proved the strength of that devotion by tracking down his classic motor for a second time, 61 years after he first bought it. After saving for months, 17-year-old Brian Rollings bought the car of his dreams in 1953 - a 1936 Austin Opal Tourer. The young engineer bought the second-hand car for £140, and spent hours polishing the bright red convertible, which even helped him woo his wife-to-be. Scroll down for video . Reunited: Brian Rollings, 77, managed to track down his beloved first car and restore it . First love: brian, pictured at the wheel in 1953, saved for months to afford his dream car . Decay: The car was rusted and decaying after years of neglect when Mr Rollings tracked it down . The famous model - known as the 'baby Austin' - was wildly popular when first manufactured, and remains much-loved today. In 1955 Mr Rollings reluctantly traded the car in for a larger alternative, but never forgot about his first ride. Decades after the fateful sale his passion for classic cars led him to strike up a search to see whether he could track down the old car and buy it back. Miraculously, the search was successful and, aged 77, Mr Rollings was able to buy the Austin 7 back for £4,000. In the 56 years since he had seen it the car had decayed considerably, but after three years of loving attention, it has been restored to its formerly glory. It has even passed its MoT. Restored: The much-loved model is back to its former glory after three years of work . Adored: The much-loved model even helped Mr Rollings woo his wife Sylvia . Mr Rollings, who has now retired and lives in Walsall, West Midlands, said: 'I bought the car from a greengrocer in Birmingham for £140 in 1953. 'I must have saved for months to find the money and I was worried someone else would snatch it up but when I drove it home for the first time I felt like a king. 'I sold it in 1955 after trading it in for a bigger car but I always regretted doing that. I loved the car and over the years I just wanted to get it back. 'I got into classic cars and bought a . Rolls-Royce and a Mark VI Bentley convertible but I always hankered for . the old 1936 Austin Seven. 'Finally I saw it advertised when I went to the Practical Classics Restoration Show at the NEC in 2011. I enquired about the car immediately but was devastated to learn it had been sold the day before. Poor condition: Both the interior and the exterior of the car were in a bad way when Mr Rollings bought it back in 2011 . Rusted: It took a lot of work to restore the car, a process which has cost some £10,000 . Gutted: The car, which had turned a shade of orange, was completely stripped down and repainted . 'It had been off the road for 40 years in a barn in Coleshill in Warwickshire. It was rotten and covered in toy teddy bears. I didn't recognise it. But when I saw the number plate my heart jumped. 'I was determined not to let it slip away. The purchaser had agreed the deal and, even though it was painted orange and in a very grim state, I knew I could get it back to how it used to be. 'I collected the car the following week and started on the restoration immediately. I was 75 when I got the car back so I felt time was of the essence. 'Then on November 4, 2012, just eleven months after the project began it passed its MoT first time. I love driving it around now. I feel exactly like I did when I was 17.' Wife Sylvia, 77, a retired adminstrator, added: 'I always say to people that Brian loved two things in this life, me and that Austin Seven. 'I remember him driving me around when we first started courting and it is lovely to go out again and re-live all those wonderful memories.' The Austin 7 - or 'Baby Austin' - was one of the first breakout success stories of British motoring. Developed in the face of flagging fortunes from its manufacturers, the diminutive model lowered the cost of motoring and was a first car to thousands who had never driven before. The car - which is so tiny it can fit on a billiards table - eventually sold 375,000 models, and the designed was licensed in countries including France and the USA, giving it even further reach.

"By . Adrian Durham . Follow @@talkSPORTDrive . MAN CITY MUST DOMINATE IN EUROPE TO KEEP SHEIKH MANSOUR SATISFIEDJOSE MOURINHO HAS WRECKED ASHLEY COLE'S ENGLAND CAREER . Let me highlight three young English players who ended the Premier League season on a high, and who I would love to see build on that next season. Firstly, Carl Jenkinson at Arsenal. He poked home his first goal for the Gunners at Norwich and then charged towards the travelling fans to celebrate like it meant the world to him – probably because it did. He’s an Arsenal fan, from a family of Arsenal fans and having met him and talked to him I can confirm it is genuine – this kid is a Gooner through and through. If he wasn’t playing for them, he’d have been in the away end at Carrow Road. Boyhood dream: Lifelong Arsenal fan Carl Jenkinson scored his first goal for the club in the 2-0 win over Norwich on Sunday . What a moment: Jenkinson has supported Arsenal all his life and realised a dream by scoring in a Gunners' shirt . It must have been so frustrating for Carl to watch Bacary Sagna picked ahead of him week in week out last season. Especially when you see the England squad and realise another right-back is needed. I’m a big fan of Carl Jenkinson, I think he has the talent that can be developed and turn him into a top full-back for club and country. From an England fan’s point of view, I hope Sagna leaves Arsenal this summer – he’s being linked with Manchester City. England need Carl Jenkinson to blossom at the Emirates sooner rather than later. And how lucky are the Gunners fans? They have one of their own playing for them, and caring about the results and performances as much as they do. Whoever you support, you’d all love a player like that in your team. First choice: Bacary Sagna has played ahead of Jenkinson in Arsenal's defence this season . Secondly, Dwight Gayle. As a Posh fan, I watched him at Peterborough United and even though he was only with the club a few months, and we were relegated in that time, it was obvious he had the ability to go higher. Crystal Palace paid £6m for him - and in all honesty it was probably too much - but the critics couldn’t stop banging on and on about that transfer fee. Especially when it emerged Ian Holloway didn’t really know how to get the best out of him, and Gayle then got injured. He scored Palace’s goal of the season – a stunning strike to win a Christmas fixture at Aston Villa – but I always got the impression Tony Pulis felt Gayle was too much of a risk while Palace were still fighting for survival. Top form: Dwight Gayle has shown he can handle the pressure in the Premier League with a number of goals for Crystal Palace . Curled: Gayle fires home a free-kick to score his second goal for Palace in the 2-2 draw at Fulham on Sunday . Allowed to play a part with Palace safe, Gayle flourished. He didn’t just score goals, he took up positions, he made runs, he outwitted defenders. His finishing was fantastic. He started only eight Premier League games for Palace this season, but ended up top scorer for the club. That’s some achievement for a player who was playing in the sixth tier with Bishops Stortford two years ago. There is speculation Gayle will be sold by Tony Pulis this summer. I hope the manager has seen enough to challenge himself to turn Gayle into an international striker. To be honest I would have been happier seeing Gayle on Roy Hodgson’s World Cup standby list ahead of Andy Carroll. On call: Dwight Gayle should be ahead of West Ham's Andy Carroll on England's stand-by list for the World Cup . Thirdly, another player who I felt was ahead of Carroll for England recognition: Sunderland’s Connor Wickham. For so many reasons he should have been on Roy Hodgson’s standby list. He ended the season strongly, making a major contribution to Sunderland’s incredible survival run. But he has also represented England at several age levels, including 17 games for the Under-21s and he has tournament experience at that level as well. His brilliant form at the right time should have been rewarded with a place on standby for the World Cup, and that would also be a way for Roy to tell young players if they do the business at junior England levels, that will be recognised at senior level. Leaving Wickham out makes me wonder if the Under-21s are worthwhile. Wickham needs to bring consistency over the course of a season in the Premier League. I’m hoping he achieves that in 2014-15. Fine season: Connor Wickham has been instrumental in Sunderland's Great Escape from the Premier League relegation zone .","Jenkinson's goal at Norwich shows how much he loves Arsenal .
Gayle has shown he can cut it at top level with goals for Crystal Palace .
Wickham should have been above Andy Carroll on World Cup standby list ."

"By . Meghan Keneally . Fired: Jill Abramson was paid significantly less than her male counterparts for the past 13 years . The recently-ousted executive editor of The New York Times had been paid more than a hundred thousand dollars less throughout her career at the paper than her male counterparts, new reports reveal today. Jill Abramson's unexpected removal from the paper of record came as a shock to many and once speculation began to swirl that she had raised concerns about gender pay discrepancies before her firing, the owner of The Times tried to dismiss those claims by saying that she was paid more than her male predecessor- a statement that has now been proven untrue. Bill Keller was the paper's executive editor from July 2003 until he resigned and Abramson replaced him in September 2011. Her starting salary at that point was $475,000 while Keller's salary in 2011, after eight years as editor, was $559,000. The New Yorker reports that her salary was raised at some point in the past three years to $503,000 and then when she complained about the discrepancy recently, it was raised again to $525,000- but that still left her $34,000 short of Keller's final salary. This is a direct contradiction to what Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr, said in a public statement that he released to attempt to tamper the fires once word got out that pay discrepancy was a factor in Abramson's dismissal. Scroll down for video . Succession plan: Bill Keller (right) left the executive editor spot in September 2011 and Abramson (center) replaced him- though she was paid nearly $85,000 less at the time. Dean Baquet (left) has since replaced her . 'Her pay is comparable to that of earlier . executive editors. In fact, in 2013, her last full year in the role, . her total compensation package was more than 10% higher than that of her . predecessor, Bill Keller, in his last full year as Executive Editor, . which was 2010,' Sulzberger said in the statement. 'It was also higher than his total compensation in any previous year.' December 2000: Jill Abramson becomes the Washington bureau chief, taking over after Phil Taubman. He was reportedly paid at least $100,000 more than she was . July 2003: Abramson and John Geddes were appointed as co-managing editors by Bill Keller, who had just been appointed as the paper's executive editor. Abramson earned $398,000 which was less than Geddes, though it is unclear how much he earned . September 2011: Keller stepped down and Abramson took his place, making her the first female executive editor of the paper. Keller's salary was $559,000 at the time and Abramson's starting salary was $475,000 . If The New Yorker's figures are true, Sulzberger's statement is factually incorrect. Behind closed doors before her dismissal, Abramson was reportedly angered further when she later discovered that the pay discrepancy did not just start when she reached the top of the masthead. She learned that she consistently earned less than her male counterparts when she was both managing editor and the Washington bureau chief. As managing editor, she earned $398,000 which the New Yorker reports is less than what John Geddes, her male co-managing editor, earned. Phil Taubman was paid at least $100,000 more than Abramson when he served as Washington bureau chief before she did from 2000 to 2003. These figures, reported late Thursday . by The New Yorker's media reporter Ken Auletta, contradict what . Sulzberger Jr said in the public statement that he released to attempt . to tamper the fires once word got out that pay discrepancy was a factor . in Abramson's dismissal. 'It . is simply not true that Jill’s compensation was significantly less than . her predecessors,' he said in the statement released Thursday . afternoon, one day after he announced the removal of Abramson. The . Times' spokeswoman Eileen Murphy has made the point repeatedly that the . editors' compensation levels cannot be looked at as one solitary figure . because the editors also receive bonuses, stock grants, and unspecified . long-term incentives. #pushy: Recently canned New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson is using her newly discovered free time to take up boxing...and to fuel rumors she was fired for being #pushy with this Instagram photo posted by her daughter . According to The New Yorker reporter Ken Auletta, Ms Murphy 'conceded' that Abramson's recent decision to hire a lawyer to look into the discrepancy issue did play a role in her firing- not because of the famously-liberal company's lack of dedication to equal pay but because 'it was part of a pattern'. Sulzberger has consistently tried to paint the firing as a result of conflicting management styles- Abramson's allegedly being too brusque and, as quoted in one report, 'pushy', as opposed to her replacement Dean Baquet who is known for being well-liked in the newsroom and more approachable than his female predecessor. Memo from Arthur Sulzberger Jr. obtained by POLITICO . Dear Colleagues, . I am writing to you because I am concerned about the misinformation that has been widely circulating in the media since I . announced Jill Abramson’s departure yesterday.  I particularly want to . set the record straight about Jill’s pay as Executive Editor of The . Times. Pushback: NYT publisher Arthur Sulzberger, Jr. has already swung back with a Thursday memo to employees that said not only was Abramson not paid less than her male predecessor, but was compensated more . It is simply not true that Jill’s compensation was significantly less than her predecessors.  Her pay is comparable to that of earlier executive editors.  In fact, in 2013, her last full year in the role, her total compensation package was more than 10% higher than that of her predecessor, Bill Keller, in his last full year as Executive Editor, which was 2010.  It was also higher than his total compensation in any previous year. Comparisons between the pensions of different executive editors are difficult for several reasons.  Pensions are based upon years of service with the Company.  Jill’s years of service were significantly fewer than those of many of her predecessors.  Secondly, as you may know, pension plans for all managers at The New York Times were frozen in 2009.  But this and all other pension changes at the Company have been applied without any gender bias and Jill was not singled out or differentially disadvantaged in any way. Compensation played no part whatsoever in my decision that Jill could not remain as executive editor. Nor did any discussion about compensation.  The reason — the only reason — for that decision was concerns I had about some aspects of Jill’s management of our newsroom, which I had previously made clear to her, both face-to-face and in my annual assessment. This Company is fully committed to equal treatment of all its employees, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation or any other characteristic. We are working hard to live up to that principle in every part of our organization.  I am satisfied that we fully lived up to that commitment with regard to Jill.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Isaac Barnett took a bold step last year: He told teachers and classmates at his Kansas high school that the student they had known as a girl now wanted to be accepted as a boy. His close childhood friend, who also identified as transgender, was ready to reveal his secret, too. With the administration's blessing, a segment featuring the two friends talking about their transitions aired in the school's classrooms, alongside a basketball team promotion and a feature on the importance of the arts. 'I didn't get any questions or hate or put-downs or anything like that,' said Barnett, now 18, adding that they called him Isaac immediately - a drama-free coming-out that would have been extraordinary in schools a decade ago. Change: Transgender high school students Isaac Barnett, (left), and his prom date, Jasen Wilson, pose for photos after picking up their tuxedos for prom in Kansas City, Missouri . With children rejecting the birth gender at younger ages and the transgender rights movement gaining momentum, schools in districts large and small, conservative and liberal, are working to help transitioning youth fit in without a fuss. California this year became the first state with a law spelling out the transgender student rights in public schools, including the ability to use restrooms and to play on sports teams that match their expressed genders. Another 13 states prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity in schools. Dozens of districts, from Salt Lake City and Kansas City to Knoxville, Tennessee, and Decatur, Georgia, have adopted similar protections. Parents are increasingly seeking a comfortable learning environment for their transgender children, according to Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund Executive Director Michael Silverman. Happy: Isaac and Jasen were both born as females and are open about their transgender status in their schools and say friends, teachers and administrators have been much more supportive than they expected . His group represented the parents of a transgender Colorado grade school girl who was prevented from using the girl's restroom until state civil rights officials ruled in her favor last year. There's 'a new generation of parents who grew up in the age of the gay rights movement and are saying, `We want to do what is best for our children,' he said. The trend is likely to accelerate with help from the federal government. Last month, the U.S. Education Department alerted districts in a memo on sexual violence that it would welcome civil rights complaints from transgender students under Title IX, the 1972 law that bans gender discrimination at schools. The guidance gives families new leverage to negotiate access to locker rooms, sports teams and other kinds of accommodations covered under California's law, said Mark Blom, a National School Boards Association attorney. Stroll: Isaac and Jasen, walk along a creek in the Country Club Plaza in Kansas City, Missouri . He said the memo surprised him because courts have said Title IX doesn't provide protections for sexual orientation or gender identity. 'It's going to create a real problem for school districts because the department has the right to go in and attempt to require the district under threat of losing federal funding to meet the standard the department articulates,' Blom said. School officials in states without anti-discrimination provisions for transgender residents already have been grappling with how to serve students whose needs conflict with traditional views about when and why boys and girls are separated. The ACLU of Mississippi got involved last year when a high school senior who was born male but identified as a girl wanted to dress accordingly. The principal balked, saying the dress code required clothing to conform to gender. The school board relented and stood by its decision, even after some parents and students complained, said Bear Atwood, then the state ACLU's executive director. Laces: Issac and Jensen prepare for their prom after announcing they were transgendered - a move which would have been more difficult a generation ago . 'For a long time they would have told you we don't have any trans kids here,' Atwood said. 'But as more and more kids are coming out everywhere else in the country, that is true in Mississippi as well. 'There is this sense of, `We have to start figuring out how to deal with this,' Atwood said. Last week, a Christian legal group, Alliance Defending Freedom, asked the Louisville, Kentucky, school board to overrule a high school principal who allowed a transgender freshman to start using the girl's bathrooms. The principal has since limited the student to one girl's restroom but said treating her like other female students adhered to the recent Title IX guidance. Moving on: Isaac Barnett, left, and his prom date, Jasen, walk towards the Kansas City skyline . 'When the issue of gender identity was brought to my attention, I had to educate myself on the issue and what this means in terms of fair and just treatment of transgender people,"" Atherton High School Principal Thomas Aberli said. Alliance Defending Freedom attorney Jeremy Tedesco said schools should instead give transgender students the option of using staff or unisex facilities, as many do. 'The fact that we are in a position culturally where schools are just caving to these demands is very concerning,' he said. Kim Pearson, training director of Trans Youth Family Allies, estimates that for every case that makes headlines there are dozens that are resolved quietly and easily. Since she co-founded the support and advocacy group in 2007, Pearson has worked with parents and educators in half of the states. 'If a school wants to get it, they will,' Pearson said.","Schools across the United States are adjusting their classrooms and locker rooms to accommodate transgendered children .

The 87-year-old woman missing since her husband was found murdered at their Georgia home and found Friday in a lake has been revealed to have died of a blow to the head. Shirley Dermond's body was found after missing for weeks since husband Russell Dermond was discovered decapitated on May 7, authorities said. Russell Dermond, 88, was stashed in the garage of the elderly couple's $1 million Great Waters home. Shirley Dermond pulled from Lake Oconee, only miles away. Tragic find: Shirley Dermond's body was found in a lake on Friday afternoon. Police have been searching for her since May 7, when her husband Russell was found murdered in their $1 million home . Shirley Dermond was killed before she was tossed into the lake by her murderers, a law enforcement source told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. she did not drown. Divers are now combing the lake about two hours east of Atlanta for Russell Dermond's head, the source added. Sources told 11 Alive that a fisherman had discovered the elderly woman's body near a dam on Friday afternoon, . Investigators said they still have no leads on the murder of Russell Dermond, and his head has still not been found. They had offered a reward of up to $20,000 as police began an extensive search effort to try to find Shirley Dermond, and her husband's killer. Investigators . in Putnam County, Georgia, are completely baffled by the gruesome crime . and no one can understand why anyone would want to harm the beloved . elderly couple. A coroner said Russell Dermond was dead before his head was removed, and had possibly been shot or struck with a large object. His wife was never a suspect in the murder, and this latest discovery confirmed that theory. Nothing was taken from the couple's home and their car keys and cellphones were left behind. Gruesome: Russell Dermond's decapitated body was found at the couple's exclusive lake-front home on May 7 . Discovery: Officers dredge a lake during the search for Shirley Dermond. Her body was found by a fisherman . Earlier this week officers began dredging a lakes and woods near the couple's home for clues. One . of the Dermond's three heartbroken children said the family had . been trying to come up with a possible motive - but they say their . parents did not have any known enemies. Before his mother was found, 55-year-old Keith, from Jacksonville, Florida, told MailOnline: ‘We are . completely devastated ...The . thought of her suffering is just unbearable. ‘Each . hour that goes by, my brother, my sister and me are becoming more . resigned to the fact that we may never see her again and we may never . know what happened. ‘If . she is still alive, we can’t imagine what she is going through. The . human spirit is incredibly strong… but it has almost got to the stage . where we hope she is with our father, just to ease her suffering. ‘Whoever did this was so sick in the head that I just can’t imagine it.’ Russell Dermond was last seen on May 1 at a supermarket not far from his home in the gated Reynolds Plantation east of Atlanta. Concern: The alarm was raised when the couple failed to turn up to a Kentucky Derby party . Shirley . Dermond had started the next day’s newspaper crossword puzzle, but no . one had taken the couple’s May 3 mail out of their mailbox.  That same . day, last Saturday, the Dermonds failed to show up at a friend’s . Kentucky Derby party. Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills has said financial and phone records . have not turned up anything to suggest the Dermonds would be the target . of criminal activity. Sheriff . Sills has been forced to deny rumors that Mr Dermond – whose body was . found in his garage - was in a witness protection program and may have . been killed by mobsters.

Mark . was shot in Atlanta as he apparently tried to buy crack cocaine . on his birthday. Troy Major was convicted and sentenced to life . imprisonment for murder. He . was also hit with consecutive terms of 20 years for aggravated assault . and five years for possession of a firearm during the commission of a . felony.

However, . with Van Gaal currently preparing the Holland squad for a . friendly on Saturday, there is only so much time he can spend in . conversation with his future employers at the moment. Once Holland’s friendly with Ecuador is out of the way on Saturday, United hope to sit down with Van Gaal again the next day. Ryan Giggs meanwhile, has been offered the job as Van Gaal’s No 2 after holding talks at the Dutchman’s penthouse apartment. Giggs . was seen coming out of a hotel in the seaside town of Noordwijk, 20 . miles southwest of Amsterdam, and it is understood that the discussions . took place at Van Gaal’s luxury home a few hundred yards away. Keeping an eye on things: Giggs made it back to Old Trafford to watch the U21 final against Chelsea . Waiting game: Giggs (right) was back in Manchester to watch the Under 21s lose to Chelsea . Van Gaal, 62, is said to have offered Giggs the job as his assistant although it is unclear if the United icon has accepted yet. The . Holland coach made the most of a day off from his World Cup camp in . Hoenderloo to return to Noordwijk and meet Giggs, having arranged the . talks last week. Dutch training will resume on Thursday when . more foreign-based players, including United striker Robin van Persie, . join up with the squad ahead of Saturday’s warm-up game against Ecuador. Van .

He returned to Manchester to . attend Wednesday night’s Premier League Under-21 Final between United and . Chelsea at Old Trafford which the Blues won 2-1. During their meeting, Van Gaal is . understood to have emphasised his commitment to playing attacking . football, as well as outlining the role Giggs would have in the new . set-up. The 40-year-old grew disillusioned with United’s cautious . style under Moyes as well as his own peripheral role in the backroom . team before taking charge as interim boss for the final four games of . the season following the Scot’s sacking. Switch: Van Gaal announced his Holland team will play a 5-3-2 at the World Cup in Brazil . If he accepts the job, . Giggs will be one of two assistants to Van Gaal, who prefers to have a . Dutch coach and one with close links to the club by his side, as was the . case during his time in charge at AZ Alkmaar, Barcelona and Bayern . Munich. Van Gaal is keen to draw heavily on Giggs’s knowledge and . insight of United. He is particularly interested in the youth academy . and has already picked the former Wales international’s brains over the . top young players coming through at the club, as well as the senior . stars who could be coming and going this summer. In his last home game in charge, it was notable that Giggs gave senior debuts to James Wilson, 18, and 20-year-old Tom Lawrence. The . identity of his other, Dutch, assistant remains unclear however. Van . Gaal has not offered Patrick Kluivert the job and Rene Meulensteen, . United’s first-team coach under Sir Alex Ferguson, remains a . possibility. Frans Hoek is almost certain to join Van Gaal at United as goalkeeper coach along with video analyst Max Reckers. The . new management will have a major rebuilding job on their hands after a . dismal season at Old Trafford descended into bickering and acrimony . among the players.

Many of the men buried at Ranville died in Operation Tonga - the codename for the airborne operation undertaken by the British 6th Airborne Division between June 5 and 7 1944. During the assault, paratroopers and glider-borne troops landed on the eastern flank of the invasion area, near to the French city of Caen.

Their aim was to capture two strategically-vital bridges over the Caen canal and Orne River - one the now-famous Pegasus Bridge, as well as to destroy some other bridges and secure several important villages. The troops were plagued by a combination of bad weather and poor navigation which caused many of them to be dropped inaccurately. But despite the problems, they successfully assaulted the Merville gun battery; secured the two bridges; destroyed others; and liberated a number of towns and villages, including Ranville.","Jason Purnell's inking features tanks, soldiers and Large Spitfire plane .

"By . Leon Watson . and Liz Hull . They would have been a deeply unwelcome sight in 1944 – and 70 years on, nothing has changed. Visitors who turned up to a D-Day commemoration wearing Nazi uniform were banned from shops and accused of being insensitive and offensive. Some 25,000 people – many in period costume – flock to Haworth every year for the West Yorkshire town’s 1940s Home Front festival which highlights the heroics of those involved in the Second World War. But two years ago a handful of visitors in Nazi uniforms tried to hijack the two-day event, upsetting a number of people including a group of German visitors to the town which is a tourist hotspot because of its links with the Bronte family. Organisers decided to take action but were powerless to ban offensive clothing, so teashops, pubs and stores put up No Nazi notices and refused to serve anyone in SS uniform.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Losing appetite: Cone sales plummeted last year and Cornetto was the worst hit with a 14% drop . If the weekend’s warm weather had you heading for the supermarket freezer cabinet, chances are you weren’t stocking up on Cornettos. Traditional ice cream cones are falling out of favour, with more Britons opting for indulgent 500ml tubs and luxury brands, says a report. Sales of cones have slumped 5.5 per cent in the past year, while demand for tubs of ice cream, including brands such as Ben & Jerry’s and Häagen-Dazs, has rocketed. According to trade magazine The Grocer, we got through 7.2million more tubs of ice cream last year than in 2012 – an 18 per cent rise. Data from market analysts Kantar . Worldpanel show that overall volume sales of ice cream rose 3.4 per cent . year on year to 341.1 million litres while value sales grew 6.9per cent . to £839.6 million. The . study says the hot summer played a big role in boosting the performance . of impulse lines with volume sales of luxury ice cream tubs also soaring . by 18.1 per cent. Cornetto has been one of the worst hit by the decline of the cone, according to the magazine, with sales plummeting nearly 14 per cent in the past year. In an attempt to revive fortunes, manufacturer Unilever plans to launch a new product this month – Cornetto Choc ‘n’ Ball – which features a cone topped with a chocolate-covered ice cream ball. The firm has tipped the new invention as 'the ultimate manly snack'. Unilever said it 'caters specifically for male consumers seeking a substantial snack offering'. Meanwhile, Ben & Jerry's is developing new products to cater for the growing appetite for frozen yoghurt. One new range is the Greek-style forzen . yoghurt tubs which come in three flavours: strawberry shortcake, vanilla . honey caramel and raspberry chocolatey chunk. Tidy: During the hot summer months, Britons opted for drip-safe tubs rather than traditional ice cream cones . 'The new products will launch to grow current and anticipated consumer and category trends - such as the growth seen in frozen yoghurt, luxury desserts and handheld formats and the trend towards consuming ice cream as a snack,' Unilever said. There will also be a line of 'gelato' Carte D'Or products designed to cater for the rise in luxury desserts on family shopping lists. The firm said it will 'enable consumers to bring the Italian gelato experience into their homes'.","Last year sales 7.2m more tubs sold than in 2012 during hot summer .

"By . SIMON JONES . The whistles of derision that greet Cesc Fabregas's every touch at Barcelona are being noted at Manchester United and Arsenal. Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino and club directors have launched a staunch defence of the 26-year-old who has been targeted by fans throughout the season and more so in recent weeks following their team's Champions League exit followed and defeat to Real Madrid in the King's Cup. Teammate Andres Iniesta said: 'Of course it hurts to see Cesc jeered. You try to ignore it and hope it does not happen, but these situations are not comfortable.' VIDEO Scroll to the bottom for Moyes and Fabregas on the proposed move in summer 2013 . On his way? Cesc Fabregas could find his time at the Nou Camp up soon, with some fans booing him on Sunday . Staunch defence: Coach Gerardo Martino has refused to criticise his midfielder this season . There would be no sense for Barcelona to sell Fabregas unless they have their transfer ban lifted but they will hold talks with him and his representatives to ascertain his state of mind and where they see changes over the coming weeks. Barcelona's board will offer Lionel Messi an improved contract but have held meetings already to discuss who could leave with some key changes expected. Wingers Pedro and Cristian Tello are also among players who could depart as is Alexis Sanchez.President Josep Bartomeu said: 'Some decisions have been made and there are others to be made. This is not the time to announce them because we are still playing in competition. There will be time for that in a few weeks. 'A lot of work has been done and it has all been good work. There won't be a revolution, but there will be in-depth restructuring of the football team.' Are we going to see this again? The Gunners are on red alert if Fabregas is free to leave the Nou Camp . Dean Saunders' son attracting Premier League attention . Newcastle and Tottenham are among the clubs showing interest in Crewe's latest starlet Callum Saunders. The 18-year-old striker is the son of former Liverpool and Wales international Dean Saunders and is showing his father's old traits in front of goal. Saunders has scored more than 30 goals this season playing for Crewe's development sides and in the FA Youth Cup, where he notably scored twice against Coventry and Reading. Although coaches insist he still needs to get stronger, he is quick, bright and has an obvious instinct to push himself into the right areas. Crewe have high hopes and have offered Saunders a three year professional contract and signing it will be a crucial decision if other clubs are serious in showing the same commitment to his development. His father Dean is keen to play down Callum's prospects, when pressed on TV recently he would only say: 'He has a chance if he keeps working hard.' Saunders Jr could yet opt to stay and follow the route of other Crewe youngsters safe in the knowledge scouts will always be present to see the latest starlet to roll off the Gresty Road conveyor belt. Bilbao winger Iker Muniain too expensive . Interest gathering in Athletic Bilbao winger Iker Muniain could be tempered by a pending increase in his buy-out clause. Despite the 21-year-old having only one year left on contract, his clause is set to move up to a whopping £40million on July 1, similar to that of teammate Ander Herrera. Manchester City, United, Liverpool and Arsenal are all firm admirers of the boy from Pamplona but won't deal at that price. The notoriously stubborn Athletic board have rebuffed all talk of selling for reported bids of a cut-price £14million so the real work will be done by his representatives. Clubs are hoping to persuade him not to sign any new contract at Athletic and instead move as a free agent next summer. The warning signs for the youngster though are that Fernando Llorente took a similar path but endured a troublesome time before his eventual departure to Juventus. Too expensive? Iker Muniain could have his buy-out clause at Athletic Bilbao upped at the end of the season . Waiting game: Leeds United will not rush into offering a new deal to striker Ross McCormack . Ross McCormack won't be offered new Leeds contract soon . Leeds United will not rush into offering a new deal to striker Ross McCormack. The 27-year-old has talked up his chances of getting improved terms despite having only signed a four year contract last summer. The Scotland international is on 28 league goals going into today's game against Nottingham Forest and could become the first Leeds player since John Charles in 1957 to score 30 league goals in a season. Talking after his latest goal earned the 1-0 win over Barnsley at the weekend, McCormack said: 'In terms of my future, I've got a couple of years left on my contract. It's up to the new owner if he wants to put a contract in front of me to sign, be part of this new regime and hopefully take the club forward.'If that's not the case, we'll look at other things.' He added: 'It's good to be talked of in the same breath as John Charles. Hopefully I can nick another two between now and the end of the season. Personally, it's been a great season. It's just unfortunate that collectively we've not been good enough and the table does not lie.' Despite failed bids by West Ham and Cardiff in January, Leeds' only other offer for McCormack has come from Middlesbrough and that was last summer. West Ham remain in the market for a striker, however, McCormack may find surprise options in Italy. New owner Massimo Cellino who is in the throes of selling his other club Cagliari said: 'Ross McCormack is a real striker and I'd love to see him in Italy.' Surprise in store? Massimo Cellino said he would like to see McCormack ply his trade over in Italy . Matty Taylor a wanted Hammer . West Ham's Matty Taylor is figuring on a few shortlists ahead of the summer. The 32-year-old has been left out of the starting line-up in recent weeks and is a free agent at the end of the season when his contract runs out. His Premier League experience and versatility are making him an option for sides looking to bolster their squad with British players. Taylor has figured at left-back, left midfield and centre midfield. On the move? Matty Taylor is wanted by a selection of clubs when the season finishes next month . Goncalo Guedes wanted by Arsenal . Arsenal are continuing to track Benfica midfielder Goncalo Guedes. The 17-year-old winger has impressed in the UEFA Youth League this season scoring four goals in nine games including one in the 2-1 win over Manchester City in March. Borussia Dortmund and Manchester United have also shown an interest but Benfica are pushing for the player to sign a new contract so they can hike up his value.

Kim Jong-un's ex-girlfriend appears to have risen from the dead with reports she was seen on North Korean state television for the first time since she was reportedly executed in 2013. The North Korean former love interest was said to have been executed in September last year, alongside dozens of singers and dancers, for making a pornographic film. But the story, published by the country's own newspapers, is being questioned after Hyon Song-wol made an appearance on television.

Kim Jong-Un¿s ex-girlfriend, Hyon Song-Wol, was recently seen delivering a speech at a national art workers rally on national television, despite rumours she had been executed . During her speech, the Moranbong band member even thanked Kim for his leadership while pledging to work harder to 'stoke up the flame for art and creative work', according to the Herald Sun.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Jellyfish blooms around the world are on the rise. Recent warm weather and global warming have both been linked with an increase in sightings as well reports of giant jellyfish reaching the shores in the UK. To accurately plot this upsurge, a team of international researchers has created the Jellyfish Database Initiative, or JeDI, to track locations and predict the future spread. The Jellyfish Database Initiative, or JeDI, pictured, plots the location of jellyfish globally. It is the first of its kind to track how the marine creatures are distributed. Researchers from Southampton have already used to it discover the spread in the North Atlantic Ocean is thought to be due to the sea surface temperature . They look like something from a horror film, but barrel jellyfish recently spotted off the coast of the UK are the 'basking shark' of their species - enormous but harmless, feeding only on miniscule prey. Often they are spotted from boats in the deeper waters of the English Channel, the Irish Sea and off the Outer Hebrides. But it is rare for them to swim closer to the coast or inland, which is why recent sightings in Cornwall have made headlines. And when the seas warm up in summer and autumn they breed at a phenomenal rate, creating huge swarms. Beneath the dustbin lid-shaped bell are hundreds of tiny mouths ('pores'), each surrounded by tiny stinging tentacles to catch plankton. The stings, however, are not strong enough to harm humans. Source: Marine Conservation Society . As well as tracking where the largest concentrations of jellyfish currently are, scientists can use the database to learn more about their ecosystems. The international study was led by the University of Southampton. Currently, tracking the ecological and societal impacts of jellyfish and jellyfish blooms is hampered due to a lack of information. The JeDI map attempts to address this knowledge gap and covers the upper 650ft (200 metres) of the world’s oceans. This can be used to explore what causes the patterns of distribution, and why jellyfish are concentrated in certain locations around the world. For example, using data from JeDI, authors of the study were able to show that jellyfish and other gelatinous zooplankton are present throughout the world's oceans. But the greatest concentrations are in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. As well as tracking where the largest concentrations of jellyfish currently are, scientists can use the database to learn more about their ecosystems and plot the future spread and distribution. Stock image of the purple-striped jellyfish, also known as the Chrysaora colorata is pictured . In the North Atlantic Ocean, in particular, dissolved oxygen and rising sea surface temperatures were found to be the main cause of the large spread of jellyfish in this area. The greatest concentrations were spotted in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Dissolved oxygen and rising sea surface temperatures were found to be the main cause of the large spread . ‘With this resource, anyone can use JeDI to address questions about the spatial and temporal extent of jellyfish populations at local, regional and global scales, and the potential implications for ecosystem services and biogeochemical processes,’ said Dr Rob Condon of the University of North Carolina Wilmington. The analysis will be the first step to establishing a database that plots gelatinous presence in the Earth’s oceans. From which, future trends can be assessed and hypotheses tested. The map complements the findings of a 2013 study, led by Dr Condon: ‘If jellyfish biomass does increase in the future, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, this may influence the abundance and biodiversity of zooplankton and phytoplankton, having a knock-on effect on ecosystem functioning, biogeochemical cycling and fish biomass.’ JeDI currently holds more than 476,000 records on global jellyfish populations spanning the past two centuries. It has been designed as an open-access database for researchers, and the public, to use and contribute to. The results of the study, led by Dr Cathy Lucas from Southampton University, appear in the latest issue of Global Ecology and Biogeography .","Jellyfish Database Initiative, or JeDI, plots the location of jellyfish globally .

'SHC, please explain to me why MY SISTER . cannot receive the same treatment as every other student? Why Sacred . Heart Cathedral?' he wrote on Twitter. Jessica's girlfriend, Katie . Emanuel, said outside the school: 'I support my girlfriend. I love my school, and . I want to make it as good as it can be for people like us.' As pressure . grew against the school, it released a statement suggesting it would . try to change the policy - without saying what would happen with . Urbina's picture. 'As we prepare to pass out yearbooks, it . is always regretful when a student portrait is omitted for any reason,' the statement said. 'We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that . all students are included in the future.' Support: Jessica, 18, is pictured in the tux with her girlfriend, Katie Emanuel, at the school prom . But her brother said that the school just wanted to use a different picture of his sister, rather than the tux image. In a statement, he said: 'I am . embarrassed to call myself an alumni of a high school that does not . equitably acknowledge, respect, value and empower all of its students.' The principal, Gary Cannon, addressed reporters outside the school. 'Every student, every senior, is in the . yearbook,' he said outside the school. ' It has to do with the ‘senior . portrait issue’ and the regulations that we have. Those policies are . clearly laid out.' According to the school policy, girls must wear 'drapes' and boys must wear a shirt, tie and coat. School: Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory said the Archdiocese of San Francisco's policy dictated that girls must wear dresses in yearbook photographs . He said that he had previously spoken with Jessica about what was allowed in the photograph. He added: 'Straight, gay, bi, transgender, all that. They’re all welcome at Sacred Heart Cathedral, and at the same time we’re going to be clear in terms of being a Catholic institution what the Catholic church teaches and how do we live out that faith in a meaningful way, and in a supportive way with all of our students,' he said. Michael Urbina is meeting with school administrators about the issue on Friday or Monday. Neither he nor his sister have seen the final yearbook.","School officials want to use an alternative picture of Jessica Urbina, 18, in the school yearbook, her brother has said .

"By . Michael Zennie . A 68-year-old woman has killed her husband and critically injured her daughter and son-in-law after accidentally plowing her SUV through her house and crashing it into a lake - all while her 3-year-old grandson sat on her lap. Police arrested Carol Fedigan after the tragic accident Saturday night at Sammamish Lake, Washington, outside Seattle when they came to suspect she was driving under the influence. Her horrified neighbors, however, say that Ms Fedigan was simply re-parking her brand-new Jeep when it suddenly accelerated out of control. Before her arrest, she said she thought a mechanical problem was to blame for the crash. Scroll down for video .

The SUV came to a stop with its back wheels caught on the porch and its front end dangling in the lake. The toddler was not hurt - nor was Ms Fedigan. 'She had her grandson on her lap, was re-parking the car, put it into gear and it just took,' neighbor Kevin Connolly told KIRO-TV. Another neighbor told KING5-TV that she could not get the SUV into gear correctly and it suddenly accelerated 40 feet through the house. Police, however, suspect alcohol or drugs are a factor. She is charged with one count of vehicular homicide and two counts of vehicular assault. Injured: Fedigan's daughter Megan Berry (right) and her husband Sean Berry (left) are in critical condition.

"By . Meghan Keneally . New York City mayor Bill de Blasio's wife has told how being a mother did not come naturally to her when she first had children. Chirlane McCray has made a startlingly honest confession about how she had trouble adapting when her daughter Chiara was born 19 years ago. 'The truth is, I could not spend every day with her. I didn’t want to do that. I looked for all kinds of reason not to do it,' she told New York Magazine. Opening up: Chirlane McCray has described how, as someone who had worked since she was 14-years-old, she found it difficult to give up when she had her first child at the age of 40 . She explained in the interview published today that the role of mother is one that she did not expect later in life. 'I was 40 years old. I had a life. Especially with Chiara- will we feel guilt forever more? Of course, yes,' she said of how she found herself trying to get back to work after having her first child. ‘I love her. I have thousands of photos of her—every 1-month birthday, 2-month birthday. But I’ve been working since I was 14, and that part of me is me. It took a long time for me to get into “I’m taking care of kids,” and what that means.’ Mrs McCray was two months pregnant with Chiara when she married de Blasio, and the New York Magazine profile explains that by the time their son Dante was born three years later, Chirlane had adopted the role as the ‘default parent’ while her husband was working as the regional director of the Department of Housing and Urban Development for then-President Bill Clinton. Childhood: McCray, seen in this undated photo with husband Bill de Blasio, daughter Chiara and son Dante, said that by the time her son was born in 1997 she decided to stop work completely for a few years . 'It took a long time for me to get into ¿I¿m taking care of kids,¿ and what that means,¿ McCray said, seen here with Chiara shortly after her birth in 1994 . She returned to work after several years off but was still focused on child-rearing. ‘The kids came first,’ she said. Opening up: McCray spoke to New York Magazine about her life as NEw York City's first lady . Chiara and Dante came into the spotlight during the campaign, with Dante and his famous Afro starring in an ad for this dad that is credited with turning the tide of the race. Chiara was regularly featured on the campaign trail as well but her bigger moment came on Christmas Eve- just days before her father was sworn into office- when she released a video describing how she has been undergoing treatment for depression and drug abuse. ‘I've had depression like clinical depression for my entire adolescence,’ Chiara said in the video. ‘My mom was trying really hard to help me, just like, you know, any little thing she could and my dad was doing the same but obviously he was very busy. But you know they were both very emotionally commited to trying to figure out some way to get me better.’ The New York Magazine piece is far from the first time that Mrs McCray has been open about her personal life, as she penned an essay for Essence Magazine in 1979 coming out as a lesbian. She had romantic relationships with women for the majority of her adult life before dating de Blasio, and she told New York that one of the most moving moments early on in their courtship came when he introduced her to his mother and his aunts, that he called ‘The Three Graces’, who had raised him after his estranged father’s suicide. ‘That moved me. It really did,’ Mrs McCray said. Celebrating: McCray, seen with her husband and children on Mother's Day, is now back at work and is a constant advisor to her husband, personally vetting most staff picks for City Hall . Their relationship has grown from there, with New York City’s first couple celebrating their 20th wedding anniversary last week and Mrs McCray posted a photo on her Twitter feed of the pair smiling while toasting champagne. Throughout the mayoral campaign, Mrs McCray was often described as a co-mayor, but insiders painted her role as more of a constant partner and sounding board for her husband. Some advisors actually nicknamed her ‘mophie’, which is the name of a type of iPhone case used by de Blasio, because ‘one entirely covers the ¬other; they are inseparable’.","Chirlane McCray told how it took her a while to adjust to not working and raising her children instead .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Day release: Michael Wheatley, who is charged with being unlawfully at large, was on temporary release when he fled an open prison . More than 1,600 murderers, druglords and other hardened criminals were granted day release last year. They joined 518,000 other convicts who were handed freedom passes in 2012-13 - almost double the rate 10 years ago. But 431 failed to return, and seven are still at large. The shocking figures reported in The Sun have emerged after 'Skull Cracker' Michael Wheatley fled an open jail last week while serving 13 life sentences. Last July, Ian McLoughlin, 55, was convicted of murdering Graham Buck in the village of Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, while on day release. Murderer Joseph Williams, 52, carried out 11 armed raids on bookmakers after being handed a release pass in 2010. And Mark Neville, a drug dealer, spent his day out of prison in 2008 overseeing a £14million cocaine deal. Parole officers insist the system is a necessary part of rehabilitation. A temporary licence is designed to help prisoners settle back into the community towards the end of their sentence by allowing them to attend work or training. Some can be granted a pass to visit a dying family member or seek medical treatment. However, campaigners and politicians last night blasted the restraints as 'uncontrolled', allowing convicts to escape. Other cases: Last July, Ian McLoughlin (left), 55, was convicted of . murdering Graham Buck while on day release. Joseph Williams (right) raided 11 bookmakers during his time on temporary release in 2010 . Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan has written to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling calling for tighter restrictions and demanding an explanation as to why Michael Wheatley was granted release. He told The Sun: 'Prisoners mustn't be let out willy-nilly, but only for hood reasons after suitable checks.' Michael Wheatley will appear at Guildford Crown Court on May 29 charged with robbery, possession of a firearm or imitation firearm, and being unlawfully at large.

Infamous South Boston dive bar Triple O's - where Bulger allegedly ran his gang and business enterprise - will be recreated for the film using the façade and interior of the Polish American Club.

The original bar is now a Japanese restaurant in the increasingly gentrified area known as 'Southie' by locals. Sept. 3, 1929: James Bulger is born to Irish immigrant parents living in Boston’s Dorchester neighborhood. He is the second of six children. His shock of platinum blonde hair earns him the nickname 'Whitey.' 1956: Whitey Bulger is sentenced to federal prison for bank robbery. After he’s suspected of plotting an escape from one prison, he’s transferred to Alcatraz. 1960: Bulger’s younger brother, William, is elected to the state House of Representatives. John Connolly, a childhood friend from South Boston, works on the campaign. 1965: Bulger is released from prison returns to Boston. He becomes a top underling to local mobster Howie Winter, boss of the Winter Hill Gang. 1970: William Bulger is elected to the state Senate. 1975: Bulger cuts a deal with Connolly - now a Boston-based FBI agent - to provide information on the Italian Mafia in exchange for protection. 1978: William Bulger becomes president of the state Senate. 1981: Roger Wheeler, owner of World Jai Alai, a gambling . enterprise from which Bulger was skimming money, is . shot between the eyes in the parking lot of his country club in Tulsa, . Oklahoma. 1982: Bulger and Stephen “The Rifleman”  Flemmi gun down a former henchman in broad daylight on a South Boston street to silence him over the Wheeler murder. Connolly files a report with the FBI saying rival gangsters made the hit. July 1982: Flemmi and Bulger order a hit on John Callahan, the former president of World Jai Alai. January 1995: Bulger disappears on the eve of his indictment on racketeering charges. 1997: The FBI, under court order, admits that Bulger was a 'top echelon' informant launching a federal probe into the agency’s corrupt ties to its mob informants. June 22, 2011: Bulger is arrested in Santa Monica, CA, with girlfriend Catherine Grieg. Aug 12, 2013: Bulger is found guilty of a raft of racketeering charges, including his role in 11 murders. Nov 13 2013: Bulger, aged 84 , is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences plus five years. Before announcing her sentence, the judge tells Bulger that the 'scope, callousness and depravity of your crimes are almost unfathomable.' She says they are made 'all the more heinous because they were all about money.' Despite his eventual downfall, Bulger -  the inspiration for Jack Nicholson's sinister character in the . 2006 Martin Scorsese movie The Departed - was seen for years as a Robin Hood figure who . bought Thanksgiving turkeys for working-class residents . and kept hard drugs out of the neighborhood. But that . image was shattered when authorities started digging up bodies linked to . Mob killings in the Boston area more than a decade ago. Corrupt Boston FBI agents protected . Bulger for years while he worked simultaneously as a crime boss and an . FBI informant who ratted out the rival New England Mafia and other crime . groups. However, in . 1994, police and the DEA launched an investigation into Bulger's . gambling operations, with the gangster and associate Stephen Flemmi set . to be indicted. But Bulger's former FBI handler and friend John Connelly tipped him off, allowing the criminal to flee with his common law wife, . Theresa Stanley. Missing her children, it was only a month before Stanley returned with Bulger, but he fled soon afterwards with his mistress Catherine Greig. Bulger had been a great source of embarrassment for the FBI after he had infiltrated the Boston office of the bureau and bought off agents who protected him. Some feared he would never be caught and he was soon placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives List - at one point he was only second to Osama Bin Laden. FBI . agents have told how they struggled to find a workable lead for ten . years - nor did they have any good photographs of the pair. They were aware of the couple's love of animals, but appeals to veterinarians proved unsuccessful. There . had also been reports that Greig had once had breast implants and other . plastic surgery in Boston before they fled the city, and, grasping at . straws, they turned to cosmetics surgeons in the hope of a clue. To their astonishment, one came from Dr Matthias Donelan, who not only found her file in storage - but crucially, photographs. It gave them the lead they'd been looking for and started putting out public service announcements on women's television shows asking if anyone recognised Grieg. Then they got a call from a neighbour. Deputy U.S. Marshall Neil Sullivan, who took the lead, said: 'The tipster specifically described that they were caring for this cat and their love for this cat. 'So that was just one piece of the puzzle on the tip that added up to saying ""if this isn’t them it’s something we better check out immediately because it sure sounds like them.""' The pair were arrested in Santa Monica on June 22 2011. Prosecutors at Bulger's two-month trial . portrayed him as a cold-blooded, hands-on boss who killed anyone he saw . as a threat, along with innocent people who happened to get in the way. Bulger was defiant to the end, . calling his trial a sham and refusing to testify . or provide information to probation officials preparing a sentencing . report for the judge. Finally, on August 12 2013, a jury convicted Bulger in 11 of the 19 killings he was charged with . participating in but acquitted him of seven and could not reach a . conclusion on an eighth. New drinking hole: Infamous dive bar Triple O's was being recreated in a Cambridge Square on Wednesday . Favourite haunt: The original dive bar where Bulger spent time running his underground empire . Quiet on set: The inside of the building is currently being worked on to use for the Black Mass interiors . Refurbishment: The Polish American club in Cambridge is being used for the movie . Judge Denise Casper told him the depravity of his crimes is 'almost unfathomable,' calling them 'heinous' and 'all about money'. Bulger looked directly at her, listening intently. 'The . testimony of human suffering that you and your associates inflicted on . others was at times agonizing to hear and painful to watch,' Casper said . 'At times during the trial I wished that we were watching a movie, that what we were hearing was not real.' She then sentenced him to two consecutive life sentences plus five years, as prosecutors had requested. The new film is slated for release next year. And director Cooper said he was determined to 'get to the root of the psychology and behaviour' in his film, telling Collider that he was looking forward to working with Depp. 'I only want to work with actors to have a strong . point of view and who want to race to set,' he said.  'And Johnny is that type of . actor.  He’s always pushing himself and . always playing something different.  He’s one of the best actors in . American screen history. 'Our hope is to really craft a full-bodied . portrait in ways that you haven’t seen.  It’s exciting to see an actor . like Johnny really attracted to a part like this because you’ve never . seen him like this.","Depp was on set of new film 'Black Mass' about notorious gangster's life .

"By . Daniel Mills . A Queensland prison boss whose affair with a junior female colleague was sensationally outed on Facebook has quit his post following the scandal. Andrew Pike, the General Manager of Stuart Prison in Townsville, resigned last week amid allegations he was involved in an affair with 23-year-old clerk Samantha Wallis, who works for Queensland Corrective Services with both Mr Pike and his wife. Details of the jailhouse affair were publicised on Facebook by Ms Wallis' jilted ex-fiance Nick Billing, who said he 'wanted the world' to know about his former lover's secrete dalliance with Mr Pike. Outed: The former boss of a Queensland prison, Andrew Pike, quit in disgust over allegations he was having an affair with a much younger female staff member . It sparked a six-month investigation by Queensland Corrective Services, and follows a number of previous allegations into prison officers having sex with inmates and offers of sexual favours in return for money or drugs. There's no suggestion Mr Pike is involved with any other investigation. Mr Billing wrote how his ex-lover was 'sleeping with her boss at Townsville Correctional Centre Andrew Pike for the last few months.' He said while he usually wouldn't put a post of that nature on Facebook, this was perfect opportunity to out the pair. Wanted the world to know: Nick Billing posted the message (right) about his former-fiance Samantha Wallis, 23, (left) to Facebook the moment he found out about the alleged affair . A corrective services officer told the Courier Mail resigning was the former prison boss's only realistic option.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . VIDEO  Scroll down to see Dawn French speaking at the time of her divorce to Lenny Henry . Racism: Dawn French revealed she and ex-husband Lenny Henry were victims of an arson attack . Dawn French has spoken out about the racist abuse she suffered during her marriage to Lenny Henry, revealing that her house was nearly burnt down in an arson attack as the couple slept. The 56-year-old star, said: ‘It was massively shocking to me. Someone put an oily rag through our front door and tried to burn us down. Luckily I woke up and smelt it, otherwise I’m not sure we would be here.’ Dawn, who has a mixed-race daughter Billie, 23, with Lenny, 55, is concerned that racist attitudes have not changed in 30 years. And she believes that her daughter and ex-husband – who recently found himself at the centre of a race row after a UKIP candidate said he should leave Britain to live in a black country – are experiencing racism by stealth. The comedienne and actress said: ‘It’s the little snidey comments or things people think it is OK to say, a kind of gradual erosion that I find particularly dangerous.’ The pair, who split in 2010 after 25 years of marriage, have previously spoken of other shocking abuse they suffered as a mixed-race couple. They were once targeted by members of the Ku Klux Klan who smeared excrement on their front door and doorstep and daubed graffiti on their walls. Miss French made her comments on Friday evening’s BBC Radio 4 Front Row show while promoting her first solo touring show about her life, Thirty Million Minutes. Commenting on her body image, Miss French who has seen her weight fluctuate in recent years, said: ‘You are just never allowed to be anything other than a fat woman,’ she said. ‘And I thought, let me have control of this. If I can talk about things in my own voice and control how it is said, then that is best.’ She said she would not be discussing her new husband, charity boss Mark Bignell, 51, in her stage show. But she revealed she regards him as her ’sacrificial anode’. Long relationship: Dawn French and Lenny Henry, who has a daughter Billie, 23, split up in 2010 after 25 years of marriage . She said: ‘A sacrificial anode is a piece of metal which is put on the side of a boat, usually a big boat, and it gathers all the corrosion and the rust to it, so that the boat survives for longer. And that is how I regard him.’ Asked how they met she added: ‘He had known my mother for years and was a colleague of hers, helping people with drug and alcohol problems. ‘I hadn’t noticed him as I was happily married. Then I did notice him and that was that.’ Ukip candidate William Henwood was forced to resign from the party last month after he suggested Lenny, should emigrate to a ‘black country’ . His remark came after the star launched a campaign for more people from ethnic minorities on British TV and media.","Dawn French and comedian Lenny Henry suffered racist abuse .

"By . Associated Press . A mother has been arrested for allegedly grabbing a 12-year-old boy by the throat while confronting him about bullying her daughter. Delia Garcia-Bratcher, 30, of Santa Rosa, California, came to Olivet Charter Elementary School at around lunchtime on Friday and asked her son, who also attends the school, to point out her daughter's alleged tormentor, police said. The mother then grabbed the boy by the throat in front of a number of children, the Sonoma County Sheriff's office added in a statement. Remote: Delia Garcia-Bratcher, 30, came to Olivet Charter Elementary School (pictured), in Santa Rosa, California, to confront her daughter's alleged tormentor at lunchtime on Friday . No adult saw the confrontation, and Garcia-Bratcher apparently had not checked in with the school office before coming on campus, authorities said. The young witnesses later told a deputy the mother threatened the boy about bullying her daughter. The boy then ran to a classroom, told a teacher and the two went to the office where school officials took pictures of the injuries. The staff at the school took photos of red marks on the boy's neck as soon as they learned about the alleged assault, authorities said. Garcia-Bratcher was arrested on a charge of felony child abuse. She was released from jail after posting a $30,000 bail. A telephone number for a Delia Bratcher was disconnected. But on a Facebook page that said it belonged to Bratcher, she posted that she was hurt by the accusation and asserted that 'the truth will be told.' Lt. Mark Essick told the Santa Rosa Press-Democrat that deputies were looking into the bullying claims but have not substantiated them. Mixed views: News of Ms Garcia-Bratcher's arrest was met with mixed reaction as it circulated through Twitter and other social media sites . 'It's pretty unreasonable for a parent to go storming on campus like this,' Essick said. 'You can see fingerprints on his neck. 'To take it into her own hands was absolutely the wrong thing to do.' However, news of Ms Garcia-Bratcher's arrest was met with mixed reaction as it circulated through social media sites. One Twitter user, identified only as Greg, wrote: 'My mom would've done the same thing 25 years ago and did. Beware bullies.' Wayne Street wrote on another site: 'Good for Mom. Hopefully the kid will get the message.' Matthew Hayward wrote on Santa Rosa's The Press Democrat newspaper comment section: 'I have three kids, and the idea of them getting pushed around makes me upset. 'However, we, as adults, have to set the example for children. 'The kids who witnessed this event will think vigilante justice is ok. She could have made her point, without putting her hands on the kid. She resorted to violence, which puts her on par with the bully.'

As a writer myself, it’s brilliant to be reminded how passionately readers feel about books they love. 'The Women’s Prize was founded in 1996 both to celebrate exceptional writing by women and also to promote outstanding books by women to as wide a range of male and female readers as possible, whatever age, wherever they live, whatever their circumstances or experiences. 'This project - marking the first year of our exciting new partnership with Baileys - is a wonderful way to encourage readers to share their #ThisBook stories via social media. Our eminent group of women have started the ball rolling and I can’t wait to see what other books have had such an impact.

"By . Lillian Radulova . When Kathryn Eliza Matiszak, 31, sped through a red light in Melbourne on August of 2011, she claimed the lives of two parents and sentenced their young children to a lifetime as orphans. Matiszak was sentenced to six years in jail with a minimum of three years and three months and had her licence cancelled for four years at the Victorian County Court on Monday. She had been driving 15km/h over the speed limit and the traffic light had been red for six seconds when she drove through the intersection and hit Fernando Marino, 33, and Karen McGovern, 31. Fernando Marino, 33, and Karen McGovern, 31, were the victims of a fatal crash in Melbourne, when Kathryn Eliza Matiszak, 31, sped through a red light at 15km/h over the speed limit in 2011 . The family of the couple killed, say they are devastated she could walk from jail in as little as almost three years, with Ms McGovern's father Peter McGovern dubbing the sentence too lenient. 'Devastated, we all are,' he said outside court. 'No sentence is good enough for what we've lost. We've got a life sentence, her children have a life sentence. 'It's not enough. It never will be enough.' At a hearing on Thursday, Mr McGovern said: 'I can never ever forgive this person for the lives she has destroyed,' The Age reported. Mr Marino's mother Maria told the court on the same day, that her intense grief sometimes left her struggling to breathe. Matiszak, wept in a Victorian County Court dock on Monday as Judge Damian Murphy outlined the consequences of her crime. Kathryn Matiszak, who has resumed taking heroin since the incident, wept in the Victorian courtroom as she was sentenced to a maximum of six years in prison . 'Your conduct has resulted in the death of a loving couple, the building block of our society, and left two children orphans,' he said. 'Your dangerous driving has destroyed the natural order. Parents should not have to bury their children. 'Children should be raised by their parents, not grandparents, aunties and uncles.' The couple from Albion Park in NSW were on a weekend trip to Melbourne to watch Ms McGovern's beloved AFL team the Sydney Swans play at the MCG, when they were hit while crossing a road in Carlton's restaurant district. They both died in hospital from their injuries. One of the victim's father, Peter McGovern, said he could never forgive the driver and dubbed her sentence as too lenient . Matiszak of Keilor, pleaded guilty to two counts of dangerous driving causing death. She never provided a reason for her lapse of concentration, but Judge Murphy condemned her combination of speed and significant inattention. 'For a period of nearly 10 seconds you were inattentive ... and exceeding the speed limit to boot,' he said. He accepted Matiszak was genuinely remorseful for her crime and said her young son would provide incentive for her rehabilitation. On Thursday, Matiszak's defence lawyer told the court that 'Her remorse truly is dreadful to behold.' He said that she had begun to take heroin, despite having been rehabilitated years ago, and was finding it too difficult to care for her son. A psychiatrist also revealed that since the incident, Matiszak had begun to suffer from severe anxiety and depression, and claimed to have heard voices.

"By . Zoe Szathmary . A petition calling for Obama and the Department of Health and Human Services to commission a study re-examining female genital mutilation (FGM) figures has reached over 47,000 signatures. The petition is led by 24-year-old Jaha Dukureh, who lives in Atlanta, Georgia. Dukureh writes on the petition's Change.org page that she was a victim of FGM as an infant in Gambia. Scroll down for video . Activist: Jaha Dukureh, seen in these 2013 file photo, was born in Gambia and subjected to female genital mutilation as an infant . 'This is just the beginning of our work and we won't back down,' Dukureh says . 'It took away a part of my femininity, my ownership to my body,' she says. 'Some girls, including my half-sister who died from complications from being cut, even lose their lives.' 'When I was 15 and I got married and I was unable to have sex it was like I went over FGM all over again, because when they cut you open, even though this initially happened to me as a baby, but the re-opening process was just them cutting me again,' she said in a video interview with the Guardian. The World Health Organization says the practice doesn't have health benefits and carries multiple risks, including infertility, urinary tract infections and cysts. Dukureh says on the petition's page that she's spoken with American victims of FGM. 'These young women are your average American teenagers -- some of them you know, some of them you went or go to school with,' she says. 'And there are many more girls in the US that are at risk of being cut.' Call for change: Dukureh is asking the Obama administration and the CDC to commission a study that shows how many women and girls are victims of FGM and how many are at risk in the US . The practice was outlawed in the United States in 1996. Dukureh notes that while Obama signed the Transport for Female Genital Mutilation Act in 2013 - which makes it illegal to take girls out of the country for FGM - there aren't recent statistics on the number of victims and those at risk. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in 1997 that an estimated 168,000 women and girls either had or were at risk for FGM. Sanctuary for Families says the number of women and girls at risk increased by 35 percent between 1990 and 200. Dukureh's campaign was backed by Congressman Joe Crowley (D-NY), UN representative Nafissatou Diop and Guardian editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger at its launch last week. The paper previously endorsed a FGM awareness campaign in the UK. 'This is just the beginning of our work and we won't back down and we won't go away until girls are protected,' Dukureh says.","Petition is led by 24-year-old Jaha Dukureh, who says she was a victim of female genital mutilation (FGM) as an infant .

"By . Liz Hull . Police at one of the country’s largest forces are not dealing with crimes in person because of budget cuts. Officers in Lancashire have been told not to attend certain incidents, including minor thefts and burglaries at shops, unless there is a realistic chance of solving them. Instead, victims are being told to report crime online or even over the phone. Officers in Lancashire have been told not to attend certain incidents, including minor thefts and burglaries at shops, unless there is a realistic chance of solving them . Other minor investigations such as mobile phone theft and lost property will be shelved. Crime scene investigators will no longer be sent to routine vehicle or criminal damage incidents. Lancashire Constabulary has already made around £43million of cuts, resulting in a loss of around 500 frontline officers, but the Government says it must find another £20million of savings. The policy emerged locally when Paul Hansen, 35, from Preston, was told that police couldn’t attend to help him recover his stolen moped because of budget cuts. The bike, which Mr Hansen was restoring, was stolen from outside his house and, after reporting it to the police he found it himself, smashed up by a canal. Lancashire Constabulary has already made around £43million of cuts, resulting in a loss of around 500 frontline officers, but the Government says it must find another £20million of savings (stock image) The dad-of-one said: ‘As somebody that pays taxes we are supposed to have faith in the police. Somebody can steal a motor vehicle or cause criminal damage and the police are not interested. ‘I am still raging. There’s fingerprints on it. If they took the prints they would find the perpetrator. This is nothing short of embarrassing, not only does it show the police do not care, it also shows the blatant disregard for the victims of crime.’ The force has also stopped providing crime numbers for people who have had their mobile phones stolen - something required by most mobile phone companies and insurers in order to get a replacement. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Bates defended the move. ‘Every report of crime to Lancashire Constabulary is scrutinised by a police officer and a decision is made on the most appropriate course of action,’ he said. ‘This action could range from the immediate attendance of an officer, through to a telephone-based investigation. We have not stopped dealing with non-domestic burglaries and minor thefts, however, the way we deal with them has changed. ‘As with all crimes, we assess each of these types of incidents that come into us and from that, we decide whether there is a realistic chance of being able to solve the crime with the evidence available.’","Officers in Lancashire have been told not to attend certain incidents .

"Police have launched a murder investigation after a post-mortem revealed Antionio James Tammaso, 49, did not die in a fire as previously thought, but actually died of stab wounds . Detectives have launched a murder investigation after the body of a man discovered after a fire was found to have suffered a number of stab wounds. A post-mortem examination found that Antonio James Tammaso, 49, had been dead for two to three days prior to his flat being set alight in New Barnet, north London. Scotland Yard said police were called to the property at around 7.30pm on Thursday when the body of Mr Tammaso, who lived alone in the flat, was found. He was declared dead at the scene, and initially the death was not thought to be suspicious, but a post-mortem examination on Friday found he died of multiple stab wounds. Detectives believe the killer returned to the flat and set fire to the property and are appealing for the public's help for information about the victim and who he knew. They have released an image of a red petrol can which was recovered from the scene along with a picture of the bicycle Mr Tammaso rode. The incident is now being investigated by Homicide and Major Crime Command and an incident room has been opened under Detective Chief Inspector Glen Lloyd. Mr Lloyd said: 'We are appealing for the public's help in this investigation. 'We believe following Mr Tommaso's murder, the suspect or suspects came back to the flat two to three days later and set fire to the property. 'We would like to hear from everyone who knew Mr Tammaso to build an understanding of who he was. Who did he socialise with? Who would he be seen with? Police believe Mr Tammaso, who lived alone, may have laid dead for days in the flat before the killer returned to burn the body. They have released this picture of a petrol can in the hope of tracking down a suspect . 'Mr Tammaso would have been known locally, frequenting the New Barnet area, especially around Potters Road often riding his bike. 'We would also be keen to hear from anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious at Sheridan Lodge in the days before the fire, . 'Especially anyone who would have seen someone carrying a red petrol can, like the one the pictures we have released today. 'Maybe someone saw its owner filling it up at a local petrol station? Or walking to, or from, one? If you did, please call us.' Mr Tammaso's next-of-kin have been informed.

"By . Kate Lyons . A group of parents of autistic children have come forward with complaints against a special needs school in Melbourne with allegations that staff locked children in a darkened room, led them around the hallways on leashes and wrapped one boy in a blanket to restrain him. Two parents have taken their case to the Human Rights Commission and a third is currently before the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal over incidents that allegedly occurred between 2010 and 2012 at Marnebek School in Cranbourne, which caters for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The woman before the tribunal, who is suing the Victorian government and who cannot be named, has alleged teachers locked her son in a fenced-off courtyard as a form of punishment and restrained him during school assemblies, even though he found them distressing. Rebecca Cobb (centre), holding her daughter Shelby, has complained to the Australian Human Rights Commission about the treatment of her son Tristan (in green), whom she claims was locked 'terrified' in a dark room as a punishment. Chris Scandolera (back row, right) is also complaining to the AHRC about the school's treatment of his twin boys Harley and Matthew (front, in striped jumpers) Another woman, Cranbourne mother Rebecca Cobb, is taking action through the Australian Human Rights Commission on the basis that her son was discriminated against because of his disabilities, after finding him locked in a darkened room for misbehaving. On March 6, 2012, Ms Cobb was asked to come to the school to pick up her son Tristan, now 11, who had apparently been acting up in class. According to the teacher's notes, he had refused to do the work set for him, but was not acting in a violent or threatening manner. When Ms Cobb went to collect him, she found him locked in the 'time-out room', a dark empty room 'about the size of a disabled toilet.' Tristan was lying on the floor of the small room, which had a boarded up window and the lights switched off. She said that at the time it happened, he was 'terrified' of the dark, so she couldn't imagine that he had turned off the lights himself. 'I saw him lying on the floor, crying his eyes out, he had a (self-inflicted) bloody nose… when I opened the door he jumped up and he was like: ""Mum, take me home"".' Ms Cobb found Tristan locked in the room on two other occasions. The second time, which occurred on March 10, 2012, a small chair had been left in the room, which Ms Cobb said could have been a safety risk. 'If he is in a fit of rage, all he has to do is trip over, impale himself [on the chair] and no one would know,' she said. Chris Scandolera took his twin sons Matthew (left) and Harley out of Marnebek School amid concerns about their treatment . Matthew (left) and Harley Scandolera left the school in 2012 after their father allegedly saw children being led around with leashes . Another parent, who does not wish to be named because her daughter still attends the school and who is yet to take any legal action, said that children at the school know the room as a 'punishment room'. On one occasion, the woman's daughter told her that a teacher dragged her in there 'kicking and screaming'. The girl was put into the room toward the end of the school day and did not understand what was happening. 'She honestly thought, because there was no answer when she was kicking and screaming, she actually thought she'd been pushed in there, locked in there and had been left there for the night,' said the woman. Julie Phillips, a disability advocate for the Disability Discrimination Legal Service, who is helping all the parents with their claims, said: 'The purpose of these rooms is to punish the child, it's a very barbaric way of dealing with challenging behaviours and complex disabilities… It's just 19th century stuff.' Ms Phillips says the parents have been 'pushed into' taking legal action because the Victorian Department of Education has ignored their requests for an investigation and seems 'completely disinterested' in the issue. The alleged incidents took place between 2010 and 2012. The school denies the parents' claims . She claims that when the parents initially voiced their concerns last year, the Department of Education responded by sending someone to the school to look at its current practices. 'That is a cover-up. If [the Department of Education] were concerned, they'd get an independent inquiry,' said Ms Phillips. She also alleges that stories of the 'time-out room' are 'just the tip of the iceberg'. Ms Cobb said her first indication that anything was wrong at the school came in 2009, just one year after her son began attending Marnebek, when she saw a teacher wrap up a distressed child in a blanket 'like a sausage roll' and drag him along the corridor. The boy, aged 10 or 11, had become upset when he dropped a stress ball he had been carrying while walking back to class, said Ms Cobb. When he tried to go back so he could pick up his toy, three teachers threw a blanket on the ground, tackled him, wrapped him up in the blanket and dragged him down the corridor, she claims. 'I was just shocked. I don't know this child, so I didn't know what his issues are. But he wasn't doing anything, he just wanted his ball,' said Ms Cobb. One woman alleges teachers at Marnebek School locked her son in a courtyard (pictured) and left him there unsupervised, as a punishment for misbehaving . She also alleges that the teachers would use physical restraint to get children to perform in Christmas concerts. 'At a Christmas concert, a child would go to walk off stage. [The teachers] would grab them and walk them back onstage… If that didn't work, they'd get them to sit down and they'd sit behind them and restrain them with both arms, sort of bear hug them,' she said. Chris Scandolera pulled his twin sons, Harley and Matthew, from the school in 2012 after he became concerned about their treatment and he has since complained to the Australian Human Rights Commission about the school. Mr Scandolera said he saw children being led around the school on leashes, attached to harnesses around their chests and at least in one case this was done without the consent of the parents. 'My understanding was that the mother was not happy with him being put in the harness,' he said. Mr Scandolera was also concerned about the emphasis the school placed on medicating the children. 'Almost everyone was pushed to have their kids on medication,' he said. 'When I removed [sons Harley and Matthew] off Ritalin, [the school] went over my head to child protection trying to force me to keep them on the Ritalin, and I had to leave them on it,' he said. Mr Scandolera says the school would refuse to communicate with parents and would not seek alternative ways of treating the children, even if the methods they were employing were not working. 'They were putting my boys into isolation and time out and their tantrums and mood swings would worsen, yet they continued to do this as a means of punishment instead of looking at other solutions,' he said. Since Mr Scandolera removed the children from the school in 2012 he has seen a marked improvement in their development and behaviour. 'The boys have come so far… They're starting to read, they're stringing words together,' he said. 'It's not a miracle, it's the fact that they're in a school that knows what they're doing,' he said. All allegations were put to the school and the Department of Education. A spokesperson for the Department of Education and Early Childhood Learning said they were satisfied by 'current practices' at Marnebek School and stated: 'The Department denies the allegations and will vigorously defend the matter at VCAT.' The principal of Marnebek School, Karen Dauncey denied that the school ever punishes children by isolating them or leaving them outside without teacher supervision, adding: 'Our school is a very caring school where the students are at the centre of everything we do.' The case is currently before the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal.","Parents say their children were mistreated at Marnebek School, Melbourne .

"By . Emily Crane . A driver has been photographed watching a video on his iPad after shocked witnesses spotted him drifting in and out of his lane for 12 kilometres. The distracted driver drifted between lanes while driving along Queens Road and the Princes Highway in Chadstone on Sunday night, his iPad screen shining brightly the entire time.

"By . Daniel Mills . and Sarah Dean . Tens of thousands of disgruntled Australians have voted with their feet on Sunday, marching in protest against the Federal Government's unpopular budget. More than 10,000 people gathered in Sydney alone, where they walked from the CBD's Belmore Park to Broadway, railing against cuts to essential services and objecting to Tony Abbott's stance on human rights, the environment and industrial relations. The backlash against the PM and his government was also trending on social media, with people taking to Twitter to vent their anger. Anti-Abbott: Protestors march through Sydney's CBD today in opposition to the Abbott Government's stance on refugees and the environment . 'Personally victimised': Two young women by Belmore Park, Sydney, feel like they have been attacked by government cuts . Sunday's events coincided with an emergency meeting between state and territory leaders, which was ordered to discuss the $80 billion in cuts to health and education spending planned over the next four years. The meeting resulted in every single one of the nation's premiers, except Western Australian Colin Barnett, demanding an urgent discussion with the Prime Minister over the cuts. Speaking with MailOnline, national event organiser and spokesperson of the March in May event, Loz Lawrey, said the mass rallies provided an opportunity for people to stand-united against Tony Abbott's 'attack' on ordinary Australians. More... Tony Abbott is a liar: protesters . Budget gives Labor its voice: Shorten . Baird needs to make promise on GST: Opp'n . 'We are making the point that this budget was only ever about the government's bottom line,' Mr Lawrey said. Standing for healthcare: Protestors hold a green sign up against 'Medicare bulk killing' 'Enough is Enough:' More than 10,000 people gathered today in a rally at Belmore Park, Sydney, opposing the Federal Government's recent budget announcement . Taking a stand: An indigenous woman joined in the protest movement, which was spread across Australia's main capital cities today . Yellling: People cheered and shouted in Belmore Park, Sydney, against Abbott's government . He said protesters were most concerned with the axing of health and education funding and the thousands of jobs cut from the public sector. Hikes in university fees and the Medicare co-payment were also deeply unpopular issues. Many protestors were wearing black “F*** Tony Abbott” T-shirts that were on sale for $25 each at the Sydney rally. In other parts of the country, some 5,000 people supported a no-confidence motion in the Abbott government as they gathered in Adelaide's city centre, while a smaller gathering of 600 gathered in Brisbane's Queens Park, next to the Treasury Casino. Broken promises: Tony Abbott has been the subject of recent criticism over the government's budget announcement, which many voters believe included a number of pre-election policy back flips . Disgruntled: One woman asks 'who voted for this?' as she stands in Belmore Park . Joking: Three students claim they want to be 'wined and dined before we get f****d' Ready for battle: A smiling woman in a red coat tells the government 'bring it on' Activist Luke Rogers told the crowd at the Adelaide rally that today's protests would send a message  'that enough is enough.' 'We are here today as we were here in March, and as we will be in August, to express a vote of no confidence in the current government.' The event in Sydney was a politician-free zone, with offers by the Greens, the Labor Party and the Socialist Party to speak at the rallies turned down by organisers. Crowds began to swell at Belmore Park from 1pm and by 2.45pm there were around 8000 protestors ready to make their voices heard, according to police estimates. Making noise: A man blew a trumpet in Belmore Park . Call for help: Sunday's events coincided with an emergency meeting between state and territory leaders, which was ordered to discuss the $80 billion in cuts . The demonstrators marched to Victoria Park, watched carefully by the cops, and arrived about 4.30pm. Some of those that disobeyed police directions to stay on the planned protest route were arrested. One of the Sydney protestors, Blacktown resident Michelle Konnecke. said she wanted to show her frustration about GP co-payments. The health changes mean seeing a doctor who previously bulk-billed (or accepted the relevant Medicare benefit as full payment for their service) will now cost $7 instead of no fee. 'Hands off': There are fears that the government is destroying Australia's national public broadcaster with its huge cuts . Not happy: Police estimated 8000 people were present in Sydney's Belmore Park by 2.45pm . It is one of the most controversial announcements in the Federal Budget and will affect the 80 per cent of GP consultations that are currently bulk-billed. Ms Konnecke wore a home-made placard, which said: 'This sign is too small to list all their broken promises.' 'This is only the second time we've come to a protest and we just decided to make a sign to make our voice heard. It's my daughter's and granddaughter's future we're talking about,' she told the Sydney Morning Herald. Greens leader Christine Milne told AAP she was overwhelmed by the ground swell of anger across the country over the budget.

"By . Chris Pleasance . Marco Pierre White’s flagship restaurant in Birmingham has been given a zero food hygiene rating from environmental health officers. The four-star Marco Pierre White Steakhouse, which is on the 25th floor of The Cube, although it has now been revealed they failed a visit by the Food Standards Agency in March. The abysmal rating relates to either poor standards of hygiene structure, confidence in management or a combination of these factors and now means urgent improvement is necessary. Marco Pierre White's flagship steakhouse, on the 25th floor of The Cube in Birmingham (pictured), has been given a zero rating by food safety inspectors . A restaurant spokesman has confirmed the rating, but said staff are working with the council to address the issues . The restaurant boasts stunning views of Birmingham, and costs around £50 per head. A Birmingham City Council spokeswoman said: 'Marco Pierre White was informed their FSA rating would drop and it has been published on the FSA website. 'A certificate and window sticker confirming their zero rating was sent to the restaurant on March 25, 2014.' Despite the bad review, a spokesman from Marco Pierre White said they have acted on what needed addressing and continue to work closely with the council. The spokesman said: 'We can confirm that we received a visit from the Environmental Health Department of Birmingham City Council earlier this year. 'The feedback was provided in an informal manner by the EHO with some recommendations. 'These were acted on by the management team and subsequent revisits have been very positive. 'We continue to work closely with Birmingham City Council and have appointed a third party food safety consultant to ensure we remain up to date with the rigorous industry regulations and the ongoing changes in legislation and practice.' White trained with Albert and Michele Roux at La Gavarouch and Albert once described him as 'my little bunny' The zero rating will remain valid, until the date of the next inspection, which could be between six and 18 months’ time. The restaurant can call inspectors back in the meantime if staff believe standards have improved, but so far the FSA have not revisited. The Marco Pierre White Steakhouse joins a list of 140 eateries in Birmingham with a zero rating. The Birmingham City Council spokesman added: 'In Birmingham most food business operate to a good standard, but if they fall below satisfactory standards, our officers carry out revisits and take proportionate enforcement action to ensure that standards are improve. 'Where premises pose an imminent risk to health - eg where there is an active rodent infestation, severe drainage problems or filthy conditions - officers will act to close a business down immediately until it has rectified the problems. The restaurant, where meals cost roughly £50 per head, serves up 28 day aged 'native beef' steaks (file pic) 'This usually only takes a few days to allow the business to bring in proper systems and carry out necessary treatment and repairs. 'On average, we will take emergency action on about 40 food businesses - from between 3,000 and 4,000 inspections - each year. 'Therefore a very small proportion of serious problems are found in food businesses and the public can be assured these are dealt with quickly.' The news comes just a week after it was revealed Jamie Oliver's upmarket butcher Barbecoa, in the City of London, was forced to close after failing a health inspection. On that occasion food inspectors found mouse droppings, out of date wagyu steak and mouldy cow carcasses. Barbecoa, next to St Paul's Cathedral in the City of London, shut down for 24 hours when officers gave it the worst possible hygiene rating - branding it 'hazardous'. Mould was found growing on carcasses in the basement chillers and expensive meats including wagyu beef, oxtail, onglet, and Spanish-style pork called lomo de cana. Dirty slicers and vacuum packers were also found, as well as a 'heavy presence' of mouse droppings. Old chicken which had been de-boned and vacuum packed was found to be relabelled with a later use-by date. Sirloin steak (file pic) which will set diners back £27.95 at Mr White's steakhouse .

"By . Ryan Lipman . You could own a slice of Aussie paradise, a sprawling beachfront mansion with the lot: dual-heated pool, tennis court, spa and your very own boathouse. But it will cost you $18 million. That's how much a couple paid for this palatial home in Brighton, in Melbourne's south east, after it was offered for only the second time at what's believed to a record price in the affluent 'golden mile'. The modern looking double-storey mansion was put on the market three years ago by Wallace Cameron, the shareholder of a pathology company, and wife Joan, The Age reported. Scroll down for video . A palace to call home: The double-story mansion was on the market for three years before reportedly selling for a reported $18 million . What a view: Looking onto Port Phillip Bay, the home is set among other luxury properties in an area known as the Golden Mile . Deluxe: The home's finishings are of the highest quality and it features a range of living areas boasting water views . It is believed the couple bought the stunning home for $5 million about 15 years ago. In a reported off-market deal, the sale is said to have been finalised last week, in a purchase by retired businessman and philanthropist Julius Colman and wife Jadwiga. Named Shannagolden, the luxurious home is one of the largest set among the desired stretch of homes known as the Golden Mile. Set high at 12 Moule Avenue, the 35-year-old four-bedroom and five-bathroom house has undergone recent updates including a marble kitchen and stone-finished bathroom upgrade. Spanning 85 square metres and offering an endless list of deluxe features, the home also boasts a dual-heated pool with spa and tennis court overlooking the bay. With manicured lawns and gardens throughout the estate, it offers a boathouse and the yard sprawls onto its own  3903 square metres of beachfront. Luxurious finishing inside the home include ornate columns, sunken living areas, contrasting tiled floors and plush carpets. Fancy a match? If the new owners are fans of tennis, they do not have far to go if they are up a game . Room with a view: Waking up in one of the mansion's five-bedrooms might be easier when you're looking out over the idyllic bay . The palatial home's inground swimming pool is dual-heated and features a spa . On the JP Dixon property listing, the home is touted as existing in a 'world of its own at Melbourne's most privileged beachfront address' set at the end of its own tree-lined avenue. The double-garage manor also features an entertainer's bar, formal and casual living areas and grand formal dining room. The library/study is one of one two rooms in the whole mansion to not have sweeping view of the bay. The agents selling the home confirmed it had sold but have not revealed the price it was bought for . Set among other multimillion dollar homes, cricketer Shane Warne bought a nearby four-bedroom home for about $4 million earlier this month . Sought-after: The property is located in the Melbourne suburb of Brighton, about 11km south east of the CBD. The area is one of the wealthiest in the city and features some its most grand homes . If the home did sell for $18 milllion, that is about $2.5 million more than the previous record for a mansion in Brighton. It would have also attracted state government stamp duty of approximately $990,000. Cricketer Shane Warne bought a four-bedroom home in Kinane Street, Brighton earlier this month for about $4 million. The purchase followed the sale of his Italianate mansion Kilkerran at 6 William Street, Brighton, for $10.85 million.

"By . Louise Cheer . A quadriplegic man had to leave his wheelchair behind when an airline told him he could not bring it onboard. Peter Darch, a former West Australian of the Year, was travelling from Perth to Bali with his wife, parents and grandparents when he was approached by the same Air Asia staff who had checked him in an hour before takeoff to say they would not stow the wheelchair. His wife, Azucena, was forced to stay at the airport overnight and wait pay $700 for a flight on another airline who did allow her take the foldable, electric wheelchair with her. Peter Darch, 29, was not allowed to bring his electric wheelchair on board an Air Asia flight last Tuesday . The 29-year-old said he was 'disgusted' by the move. Mr Darch, from Mundurah, Western Australia, who was 2011's Western Australia Young Person of the Year, has complained to the Australian Human Rights Commission about last Tuesday's incident, saying it was disability discrimination. Initially the airline cited the wheelchair's batteries as the reason why they could not let it onboard. But despite having a dangerous goods certificate that ruled the batteries safe for travelling, the airline still refused to take it. Mr Darch said he tried to compromise by offering to remove the batteries and repurchase some in Bali. The wheelchair, similar to the one above, was instead taken by his wife to Bail after she forked out $700 for another flight . 'The airline’s response was no, that even without the battery – which had originally been used as the reason the chair could not travel on the airline – it would not be allowed in the cargo hold,' he told Perth Now. Mr Darch also said the size of the chair was not an issue as it could be folded down to a size that was 'not much bigger than a suitcase'. Furthermore, when asked if he could use one of the airline's airport wheelchairs to transport him to his Bali hotel, he was also told 'no'. Air Asia has denied Peter Darch was discriminated against by staff at Perth Airport . To get around, Mr Darch had to hire a wheelchair from a travel company in Bali. Unfortunately this is not the first case Australian Disability Discrimination Commissioner Graeme Innes was aware of. Mr Innes said it was potentially a breach of legislation if an airline refused to carry a person's mobility aid. In a statement, Air Asia denied Mr Darch had been discriminated against. A spokesperson said their website had a strict policy on the storage of battery-operated wheelchairs and mobility devices.","Peter Darch told an hour before takeoff he could not bring his wheelchair .

"By . Sarah Dean . A woman who fell 12 metres at The Rocks while trying to retrieve what is believed to be a packet of cigarettes remains in intensive care at St Vincent's Hospital. The 29-year-old, from the inner city, is suffering a collapsed lung, laceration to her liver and fractures to her back. 'She's stable, in intensive care' a St Vincent's spokesman told MailOnline. Life-threatening: A woman, 29, was stretchered into an ambulance after she fell 12 metres in The Rocks, in Sydney's CBD, early Sunday morning . The life-threatening accident occurred at 12.20am on Sunday as the woman was sitting on some steps on George Street, near the intersection with Hickson Road. It's believed she had just left Bar 100 when she reportedly dropped an item through a balcony railing, down a gap behind the stairs, and then tried to retrieve it, The Daily Telegraph reports. The Rocks is a popular tourist location in Sydney's CBD, steeped in history, where many late night revellers go at weekends. Witnesses saw her climb over the railing and she appeared to then slip or step off, falling between 10 and 12 metres to the ground below. 'Perhaps in the next few days she will be able to tell us just what happened,' a police spokesman told the paper. Accident: The woman was reportedly sat on some stairs in the rocks after leaving Bar 100 when she fell . Historic: The Rocks is a popular tourist destination in the heart of Sydney . Police Inspector Sean Heaney told the ABC the woman is lucky to be alive. 'She's been seen to climb over the stairs and it appears she may have slipped or stepped off the side of the railing, not realising there was a vacant drop rather than a solid landing,' he said. 'She's fallen about 10 to 12 metres down the side wall of the building.' Emergency services attended with police from Sydney City Local Area Command and Ambulance Paramedics assisting the woman. She was treated at the scene and rushed to St Vincent’s Hospital. Police are now investigating the incident.","She fell outside a bar in The Rocks, in Sydney's CBD .

"By . Sam Webb . A war hero who survived Dunkirk has been condemned to life in a wheelchair by a string of NHS blunders, he claimed today. Douglas Mainwaring, 92, of Bridgend, South Wales, visited his GP with a sore foot but alleges his botched treatment left him needing his left leg amputated. And while he was in hospital recovering from the amputation he caught MRSA - which has left him facing the prospect of losing his right foot as well. Loss: War hero Douglas Mainwaring has lost his left leg and claims it was removed after his treatment was botched. Now he faces losing his other leg . Now Mr Mainwaring, who used to be so fit he walked five miles every day, has been left devastated by his disability. He said: 'I went through a lot during the war - but what I am going through now is far worse.  'This has absolutely ruined my life.' Mr Mainwaring, who served in the Royal Army Service Corp in Europe and Africa during the Second World War, added: 'I used to be out in my garden, growing vegetables. Now I can't stand up. 'My right foot is black and I can't put any weight on it. These doctors have ruined my life.' Veteran: Mr Mainwaring served in the Royal Army Service Corp in Europe and Africa during the Second World War . His family have now contacted a solicitor and are making a legal claim against the NHS. The GP who treated the father-of-five Douglas worked for the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board which is currently at the centre of a probe into high death rates and poor care for patients. Retired long distance lorry driver Douglas's ordeal started when he visited his GP, suffering from a painful foot. The doctor said it was likely to have been caused by a verruca and tried to treat it with a freezing spray. But the spray is believed to have caused an infection that spread from his foot to the leg - which became so gangrenous it had to be amputated. Daughter Yvonne said: 'The GP sprayed quite a large area of dad's foot. Less than a month later we noticed his foot turning black. 'We took him to hospital and the first thing the surgeon asked was: ""When did you have frostbite?"" 'After that things just got worse and worse. He was in terrible pain.' Douglas, who has been married to wife Jean, 81, for 63 years, suffered repeated problems with his leg. Finally, in October 2012, medics made the heart-breaking decision to amputate his leg.  But when he was in Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend, recovering from the amputation a chiropodist cut his remaining foot while clipping his toe nails. The family say he developed MRSA in the wound and NHS staff failed to notice.  The infection has now spread to most of the foot, turning his toes black. In a few weeks the retired long distance lorry driver will find out if the foot can be saved. The war hero at home with his wife Jean and daughter Yvonne. They are now looking into legal action against the NHS . Yvonne added: 'Before this disaster Dad was the fittest man you could find for his age. Now he is in pain and has to have everything done for him.' Two hospitals run by ABMU, including Princes of Wales Hospital where Douglas was treated, are at the centre of a probe into high death rates and poor care for patients. A spokesman for ABMU said: 'We can confirm the GP surgery received a complaint and met with the patient. 'The surgery's understanding is the issues raised were resolved. The health board has not received any formal complaint. At this stage it's not appropriate to comment further.'","Douglas Mainwaring, 92, used to walk five miles a day and do his gardening .

"By . Sarah Michael . Tony Abbott has shrugged off disastrous new post-budget poll results for his government, after it was revealed he is now as unpopular as Julia Gillard ever was. The Prime Minister has also said he won't be rethinking his budget despite the states and territories promising to inflict political pain on his government over $80 billion in budget cuts. Premiers and chief ministers are demanding an emergency meeting with the prime minister before the end of July, saying cuts to health and education funding will have an immediate impact on services. Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Monday said he won't be rethinking his budget despite the states and territories promising to inflict political pain on his government . Both Newspoll and Fairfax-Nielsen show a big drop in support for the coalition after last week's unpopular budget. Nielsen shows Mr Abbott's negative rating has hit minus 28 per cent, which is as low as any number former Prime Minister Ms Gillard recorded at her most unpopular. Newspoll shows the coalition's primary vote dipped two percentage points to 36 per cent, compared to Labor's 38 per cent. But the prime minister shrugged off results showing his personal standing with voters has plunged. 'I'm just getting on with what we were elected to do,' he told ABC radio on Monday. 'In the end, my job is not necessarily to win a popularity contest, my job is to run the country effectively.' Mr Abbott's negative rating has hit minus 28 per cent, which is as low as any number recorded by former Prime Minister Julia Gillard (pictured in September 2013) On a two-party preferred basis Newspoll gives the ALP a 10-point lead - 55 to 45 per cent - and has Labor leader Bill Shorten leading Mr Abbott as preferred prime minister by 10 points. Mr Abbott says the results were to be expected. 'We never said it was going to be be easy,' he said. 'The last government which brought down a very tough budget - the Howard government in 1996 - took a big hit in the polls too. 'But in the end we were elected not to take easy decisions but to take hard and necessary decisions, and that's what we've done.' On Monday Mr Abbott also rebuffed the demand for an emergency meeting with premiers and chief ministers, saying he speaks regularly to state and territory leaders. He says the cuts to health and education funding won't come for three years so the Commonwealth and states have time to develop a new funding model. Mr Abbott says he has delivered a budget in line with Australians' expectations, despite 75% of people polled by Galaxy claiming they will be worse off . 'There's plenty of time to come to grips with this and the best possible ways to deal with it,' he told ABC radio. 'Let's talk all of this through and come up with a system that come 2017-18 ... we have schools and hospitals which are well funded, which are better run, and let's have a federation that works better as well.' But at a meeting in Sydney on Sunday state and territory leaders rejected the cuts as 'completely unacceptable' and said hundreds of hospital beds would have to be closed across the country. South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill promised the states and territories will cause the 'maximum amount of political pain' for the Abbott government unless it reverses the cuts. The Labor party are not the only one opposing the new cuts and payments. The Greens and the Palmer United Party are also opposed to the measures . 'We can explain to people the depth of these $80 billion cuts, the effect that they're going to have on people getting quality health care or get a quality education for your children,' he told ABC radio. NSW Premier Mike Baird predicted NSW would lose $2 billion over the next four years. Victoria's Denis Napthine dismissed suggestions the cuts would have no impact until 2017. 'Our advice is that's simply not accurate and we need to sit down and sort that out,' he told ABC radio. Tony Abbott says everyone needs to help pay down the nation's $667 billion debt . The Abbott government is facing a voter backlash over Tuesday's budget, which hiked the fuel excise, cut welfare, health and education spending, and introduced a new GP co-payment and deficit tax on the wealthy. Mr Abbott spent Sunday again defending the budget, which includes a Medicare co-payment, pension cuts and a fuel excise rise. In one interview the Prime Minister admitted his first budget included 'increased taxes' and in another he pointed to selective listening for confusion about election promises. 'Well, I know that people hear different things,' Mr Abbott told ABC's Insiders TV program. Tony Abbott said no election promises were broken when Joe Hockey (pcitured) handed down his budget .","Prime Minister's support from voters has plunged, new polls show .

"By . Daniel Mills . When a $250,000 Rupert Bunny artwork went missing from Albert Watt's Victorian home - little did he know it was the work of a man who used to live right next door. Not only did thief Peter Rand not arouse Mr Watt's suspicions because they where once neighbours, but because the pair were the closest of friends. They had known one another for 40 years. But despite this long-held friendship, Mr Rand, it was revealed in a Victorian court hearing in 2011, was the mastermind behind the theft of the missing work he took from Mr Watt's home in 1991. Mystery: The missing artwork which was taken from Albert Watt's home in 1991 by a friend who he had known for more than 40 years . The case sparked a lengthy police investigation, and one by Mr Watt's two nephews and original heirs to the artwork that they would have inherited when their uncle died in 1993. They even hired a private investigator to track it down - to no avail. More... Pictured: All that was left of a £30,000 Mercedes hire car that was stolen and stripped for parts before being dumped at the side of the road . Rossetti painting of his lover (who was also his best friend's wife) expected to sell for record £7million . Over the years they were never able to trace its whereabouts - until 2010, when its new, unsuspecting owner had it valued and exhibited at the  National Gallery of Victoria. Having known about the missing piece of rare art, the gallery tipped off police which led them to the home of Mr Rand's lawyer, Frank Levy, who had the painting left to him by his client when he died in 1997. Without any knowledge of its theft, Mr Levy had the painting hanging in his home for more than 10 years. Born Rupert Charles Wulsten Bunny, the Australian painter achieved success and critical acclaim for a number of his works, including the missing piece Girl In Sunlight . But upon receiving the tip-off, police seized the work and returned it to its rightful owners, the nephews of Albert Watt. A relieved Michael Watt told the Age Newspaper in 2010: 'My brother and I were both very happy to discover the painting was in Melbourne after all these years,'' But Mr Levy wasn't satisfied that they were in fact the rightful owners. He launched legal action a year later claiming that he had a right to the work he had inherited and hung in his home for more than a decade. He claimed any rights the Watt family had to the painting expired under the statute of limitations. From the court documents in that matter, details of the Girl in Sunlight saga can be revealed. Tip-off: Workers at the National Gallery of Victoria tipped police off about the stolen artwork when it was exhibited there during a retrospective exhibition on Rupert Bunny's work . According to the statement lodged in court in 2011 by both Watt brothers, from 1953 until 1961 their father and Mr Rand were neighbours in an apartment block in South Yarra, and Mr Rand ''was a regular visitor.''The painting was prominently displayed in the apartment,' Michael Watt states. 'Rand was a friend and knew of the [my father's] ownership of, and affection for, the painting.''In the early 1960s, the two men moved again within South Yarra, and lived just a few doors down from each other in Domain Road. And their friendship continued further when Mr Watt relocated to the 1970s, to his knew home where the Bunny painting was 'prominently displayed' in his dining room.For the past three years, the case has been before the Supreme Court. Last week Mr Levy finally lost his appeal.Twenty-three years after Girl in Sunlight disappeared, the painting is once again with Mr Watt's heirs.","Missing Rupert Bunny artwork was stolen from Albert Watt's home in 1991 .

Like his father, Stiles III was born with ectrodactyly, a congenital disorder that makes hands and feet resemble claw-like appendages. Stiles IIi, along with his sister, who also has the disorder, toured around the country with their father as the 'Lobster Family.' Grady Stiles III, son of Grady Stiles Jr., better known as 'Lobster Boy,' says his father was a 'drunken bastard' who was killed by a man hired by his mother after his parents got into a fight . Grady Stiles Jr., known as 'Lobster Boy,' shows off his claw-like hands caused by a congenital condition known as ectrodactyly. He was known to be verbally and physically abuse to his family, and sometimes others as well . Grady Stiles III talks about his father, 'Lobster Boy,' on an episode of the AMC program 'Freakshow,' which will air on Tuesday . 'I'm not a fan of my dad as a person,' Stiles III says on the program. 'My father was racist [and] abusive. When I cried, [he was like] ""I'll give you a reason a to cry.""' He added that his father was a big drinker and that as a result, 'it brought out the worst in him.' Grady Stiles Jr. was known to drink whiskey and smoke three packs of cigarettes a day, according to the Huffington Post. He was also know to be verbally and physically abusive to people. He gained notoriety in 1978 when he shot and killed his oldest daughter's fiance in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on the eve of their wedding. During the trial the following year, Stiles Jr. openly confessed to the murder. But he avoided jail time and instead got 15 years of probation since no prison in Pennsylvania was equipped to handle an inmate with ectrodactyly. Mary Teresa Stiles, center, flanked by her children, Grady Stiles III, left, and Cathy Stiles Berry, is shown as she leaves a courthouse in Tampa, Florida on July 18, 1994. Mary was convicted and sentenced to 12 years in prison for manslaughter and conspiracy to commit first degree murder for the death of her carnival sideshow husband, Grady Stiles Jr., better known as 'Lobster Boy' In November 1992, Stiles Jr., 55, was shot dead by a 17-year-old sideshow performer, Chris Wyant, who was allegedly hired to do the hit by Stiles wife, Maria, and her son from another marriage. At he trial, Mrs. Stiles told the judge, 'My husband was going to kill my family. I believe that from the bottom of my heart. I'm sorry this happened, but my family is safe now.' But Stiles III now says his father's murder didn't happen exactly as was told in court. 'What actually happened was my mother and my dad had gotten in another fight as usual and my mother had made the comment that something needed to be done,' Stiles III said. 'My brother had overheard that and went to the neighbor kid and told him that something had to be done. 'My brother thought that meant scaring him or beating [my dad] up or something to make him realize that he was going to lose his family. A little while later, my dad was shot.'","Grady Stiles III, son of Grady Styles Jr., also says his father was racist and abusive toward him .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Authorities in Florida say a naked body found in the water under a causeway in Tampa Bay might be that of a 9-year-old girl who has been missing since Friday afternoon. Felecia Williams was reported missing after a family friend took her to her apartment complex while the girl's mother was at a hair appointment. Tampa police and police from Temple Terrace searched the complex with K-9 units but there was no sign of the missing girl. Police say a body found under a causeway is that of 9-year-old Felecia Williams, who was reported missing Friday afternoon . About 3:30 p.m. Saturday, fisherman at the Courtney Campbell Causeway called 9-1-1 and reported seeing a body floating near the shore below them.

Authorities have not identified the family friend, but say that she does in fact exist and is cooperating with the investigation. Leads: Police say they are following up on several leads to figure out what happened to the little girl . It wasn't until five hours after Felecia was last seen that the family friend called 9-1-1 or the girl's mother. 'She told me she hoped to find her before calling me,' Demerson said. 'I'm sitting here hoping there will be good news,' Demerson said Saturday . morning. 'I know my baby. She would call her mama if she could.' Demerson said there was another adult at the apartment when Felecia was there. That person, Demerson claims, was in a bedroom and never saw the girl. 'Felecia would never, never, just leave,"" her 24-year-old sister, Shakelia Givens, said. 'She would never, never wander off. … She wouldn't just leave.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The title deed to Buckingham Palace is to go on show as part of a new exhibition at Windsor Castle. Documents from the Royal Family’s private archive have been brought out of storage – some for the first time – to mark the centenary of the archives being housed in the castle’s Round Tower. A title deed dated April 20, 1763, and . bearing King George III’s wax seal records the purchase of ‘Buckingham . House’ from Sir Charles Sheffield for the sum of £28,000 – £2 million in . today’s money. A title deed dated April 20, 1763, and bearing King George III¿s wax seal records the purchase of 'Buckingham House' from Sir Charles Sheffield for the sum of £28,000 . The property was bought by the monarch for his wife, Queen Charlotte, to accommodate the pair's growing family — 14 of their 15 children were born there. The house was later remodelled, and became an official residence for Britain's monarchs in 1837. The exhibition also includes a 100th birthday card from the Queen to Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother and a letter from Prince Albert to Queen Victoria, written during their engagement. More than 100 documents from the archives will be published in a new book, Treasures From The Royal Archives, and 25 of the items go on display at the Castle tomorrow. Among the collection are the official papers relating to the sale of Buckingham Palace – which has been used as the official London residence of Britain’s sovereigns since 1837. Some of George III's personal reflections on the loss of the American colonies are also included in the release, although they are published in book form and will not be shown at the exhibition. Insight: Also on show is Queen Elizabeth II's account of her parents' coronation in 1937 (pictured) 'America is lost!' he wrote following the War of Independence in 1783, and expressed the hope that 'we shall reap more advantages from their trade as friends than ever we could derive from them as Colonies.' Other exhibits give a glimpse of what monarchs were like as children, long before they came to the throne. One showed what the Queen  — as 11-year-old Princess Elizabeth — wrote down after her parents' coronation in 1937 in Westminster Abbey. 'I thought it all very, very wonderful and I expect the Abbey did, too. The arches and beams at the top were covered with a sort of haze of wonder as Papa was crowned, at least I thought so,' she wrote. 'At the end the service got rather boring as it was all prayers,' she added. The exhibition runs from Saturday to January 25 at Windsor Castle.","Deed dated April 20, 1763, shows sale of Buckingham House for £28,000 .

When they did tell us, that's when it hit home that we won't have our little girl for very long,' Taurima said. The Olympic medallist said it was a 'catch-22' situation, because his daughter could have died in intensive care, or they could spend three weeks playing and having fun with her. Taurima and Ms Smith temporarily lived across the road from the Sydney Children's Hospital, where they spent up to nine hours a day with their daughter.

"By . Associated Press . A new federal investigation has revealed that two planes nearly crashed into each other as one was landing and another was taking off at Newark Airport last month. The National Transportation Safety Board report classified the April 24 incident between a United flight coming from San Francisco and an ExpressJet flight bound for Memphis as a near midair collision. According to the report, the planes came within approximately 200 feet laterally and were separated by about 400 feet vertically. Little room to spare: The planes were 400 feet away from each other vertically but only 200 feet laterally, and the outbound pilot is heard telling air traffic control that he was 'real close' to the other plane .

At that . point, the United flight was about three miles away. By the time the . ExpressJet flight started its takeoff roll, the United flight was about . one mile away. As the two planes approached each other, the United flight was ordered by the tower to abort its landing and go back up.

Close call: A United Airlines 737 jet landing at Newark nearly collided into a smaller plane that was taking off in April (not pictured) At one point he tells the tower the United flight came 'real close' to him. The incident occurred at the northeast corner of the airport, where two north-south runways intersect with Runway 29, an east-west runway. Runway 29, shorter by about one-third than the two north-south runways, normally is used to provide additional capacity or offer an alternative if high winds make the other two more treacherous. It has been used more frequently since the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey- which operates the airport- began a 60-day rehabilitation of one of the two north-south runways at the beginning of April.

"By . Ap  Reporter . Battery problems resurfaced on Boeing's 787 on Tuesday, after gas was discovered coming out of a battery on a plane parked in Tokyo. Boeing said the problem on a Japan Airlines 787 was discovered during scheduled maintenance. No passengers were on board. The company said it appears that a single battery cell 'vented', or released gas. The incident comes a year after a fire in a lithium ion battery aboard a Japan Airlines 787 parked at Boston's Logan International Airport. More problems: Staff inspect a grounded All Nippon Airways (ANA) Boeing 787 Dreamliner at Haneda airport in Tokyo, Japan, following an incident with a leaking battery in early 2013. The 787 Dreamliner model of US aircraft producer Boeing has suffered a series heightened safety concerns, which led airlines all over the world to temporarily ground their Dreamliner fleets in 2013 . That was followed nine days later by . another battery incident that forced an emergency landing in Japan by an . All Nippon Airways 787. Those problems prompted the FAA and other authorities to ground all 787s for more than three months. The . planes began flying again after Boeing changed the battery system, . adding a tougher box to hold the battery and measures to contain any . short-circuit or fire. Boeing said those changes appear to have worked as designed in the battery incident on Tuesday. Disaster: Last year, a parked Ethiopian Boeing 787 Dreamliner caught fire at Heathrow airport . July 28 2012: A fan shaft fails during runway tests in South Carolina . December 2012: A Dreamliner was forced to make an emergency landing in New Orleans . January 7 2013: A battery on an unoccupied Dreamliner at Boston airport overheated and started a fire . January 15 2013: . A flight made an emergency landing in Japan after a smoke alarm went . off. The string of incidents led to regulators ordering a global . grounding of the entire Dreamliner fleet, which lasted for four months . June 2 2013: Battery-related problems were reported on a Japan Airlines aircraft forcing the airline to use an alternative plane . June 12 2013: A flight in Japan was cancelled after one of the engines failed to start . June 18 2013: A United Airlines flight was diverted to Seattle due to an oil-filter problem . June 24 2013: A Dreamliner operated by United Airlines had to make an emergency landing in Denver due to a brake problem . July 3 2013: Polish airline LOT cancelled a Dreamliner flight to Chicago because the aircraft had ‘problems with the power supply' July 12 2013: Ethiopian Airlines plane catches fire on the runway at Heathrow, forcing the closure of the whole airport . July 18 2013: . Japan Airlines plane bound for Tokyo had to return to Boston's Logan . airport after take-off because of a possible issue with the fuel pumps . November 2013: Japan Airlines pulls 787s from two international routes amid concerns about ice forming on the planes . It said it's working with Japan Airlines to get the plane flying again. Because the incident happened in Japan and involved a Japanese airline, Japanese authorities would take the lead in any investigation. If the Japan Transport Safety Board opens an investigation, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board 'would certainly participate,' NTSB spokesman Peter Knudson said. The NTSB said the incident was reported to it as a 'smoke event'. The NTSB expects to finish its investigation of the 787 fire in Boston by the end of March, and present findings at a public meeting this fall. 'Anything we can learn about the (latest) battery failure would be helpful (to the ongoing investigation),' Knudson said. The Federal Aviation Administration said it is working with Boeing and with the Civil Aviation Bureau of Japan to investigate the latest malfunction. United Airlines is the only U.S. 787 operator. 'Our 787s are operating normally, and we haven't experienced any issues with the batteries,' spokeswoman Christen David said. She declined to say whether United 787s were getting extra inspections, beyond the routine maintenance checks the airline gives all of its planes. Boeing shares fell 69 cents, or a half-percent, to close at $140.01 on Tuesday. On its official Twitter account, Boeing wrote that the '787 issue on ground at Narita appears to involve venting of single battery cell during maintenance'. A follow-up tweet claimed that 'improvements to 787 battery system appear to have worked as designed'. What isn't clear yet is what exactly went wrong to cause the smoking battery in the first place — the airline is currently investigating the incident, and Boeing says that it is working with Japan Airlines to return the plane to service. The 787 - the first passenger jet built mainly from lightweight carbon-composites.- incorporates a raft of changes in the . way passenger jets are designed, including greater use of electrical . systems that save weight compared with older hydraulics. It has suffered a spate of disasters since it was introduced to commercial airlines in 2011. In July last year, a 787 jet operated by Ethiopian . Airlines caught fire on the runway at Heathrow - forcing the closure of . the entire airport. A month earlier, Japan had been forced . to cancel a 787 flight and use an alternative plane for another due to . battery-related problems and engine failure. Despite its numerous issues, the 787 plane is still considered one of the . most impressive and advanced aircraft in the industry.","Boeing spent much of last year trying to fix problems with its 787 Dreamliner airplane .

"By . Julian Robinson . A former record-breaking athlete was forced into prostitution by a lesbian madam who ran a 'ruthless' sex ring in London, a court has heard. The Bulgarian woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, sobbed as she told a jury how she came to Britain for a 'better life' but was made to work for a ‘high class’ escort agency. Tatiana Shmyrova, 45, exploited the former runner after she had a holiday romance with her son Artyom, Southwark Crown Court heard. After she was encouraged to come the UK and promised a 'well paid' job as a tour guide, the group took her money and forced her into prostitution, it was alleged. Sex ring: Tatiana Shmyrova allegedly had a business arrangement with Natalia Cannon, pictured left, and her estranged husband William Cannon, right, which helped force a former athlete into the sex trade . Shmyrova is said to have advertised the . sex workers on a website operated by Natalia Cannon and her estranged . husband William, 52, who used the earnings to fund a lavish lifestyle. The ring is said to have included Michael Poole, pictured, who was hired by Shmyrova as a 'fixer' to ensure that prostitutes were ready and willing to carry out clients' demand, the court heard . The ring is said to have included Michael . Poole, 28, who was hired by Shmyrova as a ‘fixer’ to ensure that . prostitutes were ready and willing to carry out clients’ demands. Giving evidence from behind a screen, the Bulgarian woman who had been a promising athlete securing a national long distance record as a teenager said: 'When Artyom started to talk about London, I said I never wanted to work as a prostitute. 'For me, it is not important to have money and all those things like that, I prefer to have a normal job, so I can feel proud in myself, not feel ashamed in myself like now.' The woman, 34, told the court that before her flight in November 2012, she gave all her money including her savings to her lover Artyom. She said: 'He said I don't need any money when I come here, so when I arrived in London I did not have a penny even - I was vulnerable. 'I was scared, I didn't know what is going to happen because he did not explain anything to me. 'I told him many times I am not going to work that kind of job. I repeated that many, many times. I remember, I will never forget that.' On the profits of the sex ring Natalia Cannon indulged in shopping binges at Harrods, splashing out on designer brands such as Versace and Prada, as well as Cartier jewellery, the court heard. The 34-year-old, who is accused of conspiracy to control prostitution for gain, also lived in a £1.5million Chelsea Harbour apartment that she rented for £2,200-a-month. Russian-born Shmyrova was said to be a central part of the lucrative business that ‘bartered in human beings and human bodies’. She housed sex workers in a number of leased properties, using a network of employees to organise the ‘prostitutes’ diaries and lives’. One such colleague was her ‘partner in love and work’, Irina Bespalova, 32, who arranged photo shoots of the working girls. The madam used the internet to advertise the sex workers, having arrangements in place with a number of websites, including the Cannons’s site. Natalia Cannon, who is accused of conspiracy to control prostitution for gain, also lived in a £1.5million apartment at Chelsea Harbour, pictured, that she rented for £2,200-a-month, the court heard (file picture) Southwark Crown Court heard that those . involved in the sex ring were behind a conspiracy to traffic women to . the UK from countries such as Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania and Russia. A boarding school-educated Bulgarian woman, 34, who was told that she would be ‘working in a legitimate job’ after moving to the UK, is one of the group’s alleged trafficking victims. The 34-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was a promising athlete as a teenager and secured a national athletics record aged just 16. Having passed up the opportunity to train in America, she finished her studies at home but fell into debt after breaking her leg and struggling to pay for treatment. Shmyrova’s son Artyom , who is believed to be residing in Russia, convinced the woman to move to the UK after they enjoyed a holiday romance in Bulgaria, it was claimed. The woman was ‘excited by the prospect of coming to London’, believing she would be working as a tour guide, but was eventually ‘pushed into prostitution’. Prosecutor Riel Karmy-Jones said: ‘She was told that she would be working in a legitimate job, that she would be well paid, well treated and looked after. ‘She was persuaded by promises that it would change her life for the better. ‘However when she arrived, she found herself in the hands of people who operate a network of so called ‘high class’ escort agencies across London, mainly based in Kensington and Chelsea, Mayfair and other affluent areas. The court was told that Natalia Cannon indulged in shopping binges at Harrods, splashing out on designer brands such as Versace and Prada, as well as Cartier jewellery . Shmyrova, who lives in a gated residential block in Fulham, South West London, is said to have taken 50 per cent of the girls’ earnings, as well as charging them rent and a fee for being driven to hotels by chauffeurs. Describing Shmyrova as a ‘modern day madam’, Miss Karmy-Jones said: ‘She lives her life through prostitution – but organising prostitutes through largely the mechanism of the internet. ‘This was not an insignificant enterprise, and she also employed others to do this work - fixers to assist with the controlling of prostitutes diaries and lives.’ Co-defendants Ryzard Goreki, 37, was employed as a driver while Jerzy Molczun, 26, worked as a receptionist and ‘heavy’, jurors heard. The alleged sex ring was exposed after police launched an undercover sting in February last year. Miss Karmy Jones said: ‘This case involves a sustained conspiracy, or agreement, to traffic a young woman, for the purposes of exploitation, namely to use her as a prostitute in this country. ‘The rationale behind this is an obvious one - to make money for those involved in this enterprise, including these four defendants, who the Crown say ruthlessly pursued that objective, without any thought for those they exploited to get it.’ Shmyrova, Natalia Cannon and William Cannon all deny conspiracy to traffic persons into the United Kingdom for sexual exploitation. Both Cannons and Michael Poole deny conspiracy to control prostitution for gain, while Natalia Cannon denies possessing £13,899.79 in criminal property and a further count of failing to comply with a disclosure in relation to a four digit code for an Apple iPad. Bespalova, Gorecki and Molczun have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to control prostitution for gain and will be sentenced at the conclusion of the trial. The trial continues.

A 64-year-old grandmother who lost consciousness in the dentist chair while undergoing a complex procedure to have 20 teeth extracted all at once, died just one hour later in hospital. Retired librarian, mother-of-two and grandmother Judy Gan was having the extractions, together with implants and grafts performed at Dr. Patel’s Enfield Dental Surgery in Connecticut on Feb. 17 when she became unresponsive. The two dental assistants present have since told investigators that they begged Dr. Rashmi Patel to stop what he was doing after his patients' vitals kept dropping. Scroll down for more . Mother-of-two Judy Gan, 64, lost consciousness in the dentist chair while undergoing a complex procedure to have 20 teeth extracted at once and later died . Patel, a practicing dentist in the state for almost 11 years, allegedly refused a first request by his staff to halt the procedure and call 911 and even continued working after Gan had briefly woken up and asked him to stop. The Department of Public Health and the state Dental Commission suspended Patel's license last month after receiving an anonymous tip following Gan’s death, reports WFSB. The state alleges that Patel's actions led to her death and he could lose his license permanently at a June 18 hearing before the Connecticut State Dental Commission. According to documents obtained from the state Department of Public Health, Patel is accused of failing to respond appropriately when the woman's oxygen levels dropped, and improperly attempted to extract the teeth in a single visit. Dr. Rashmi Patel has his dentist license suspended last month while the Connecticut State Dental Commission determines if he is responsible for Judy Gan's death . Patel was aware that Gan had pre-existing medical issues. Records show that she consented to the dental work while Patel's office received four medical clearances from other doctors. The doctor’s two dental assistants have since told state investigators that Patel was repeatedly made aware that Gan's oxygen levels were falling, yet he reportedly wanted to finish his work. The assistants told investigators that ‘an assistant asked if we could call 911 and he (Patel) said no.’ The dentist soon noted one of the monitors was not working. According to the documents, that is when ‘that same assistant told Dr. Patel to stop the procedure and help her. 'He then injected the PT with the reversal agent. I thought we were going to stop. I was (relieved) because the oxygen was so unstable I didn't think it was safe to keep working.’ ‘The PT began to wake up and she asked Dr. Patel if we could please stop the procedure and call it a day,’ the assistant continued. ‘Dr. Patel wanted to get the implants in so I took over suctioning.’ Gan was having the extractions, together with implants and grafts performed at Dr. Patel's Enfield Dental Surgery in Connecticut on Feb. 17 when she became unresponsive . The . documents said she ‘kept telling Dr. Patel the PT's oxygen was dropping. He told her not to tell him again unless it goes under 60. It kept . dropping.’ It . wasn't until the situation grew even worse, according to official . statements and after a second plea to call 911 that Patel finally . agreed. However by then it was too late as Gan had already flatlined, according to the report. Just an hour after an ambulance had arrived and rushed Gan to Bay State Medical Center in Massachusetts she was pronounced dead. On her death certificate the cause reads 'pending further studies.' 'It's my belief that (Gan) did not have to die to receive this dental treatment and it is because of… Patel's negligence that she died,' wrote Dr. Gary Pearl, who was asked to review the case by the state's Department of Public Health. The health department alleged Patel . failed to respond to changes in her condition, failed to interrupt the . procedure to assess and evaluate and failed to administer any other . emergency medications when the patient's condition continued to . deteriorate. The website for Dr. Patel's Enfield Family Dental features several videos claiming people of all ages can benefit from his state-of-the-art compassionate care, but nowhere does it state that he is not currently allowed to practice following his suspension . Judith 'Judy' Gan, 64, died suddenly on February 17. She had lived in Ellington, Connecticut for 26 years and had been a children¿s librarian before retiring . Patel's attorney, Michael Kogut, said there is no medical information indicating that Patel's actions resulted in Gan's death. Gan's family had no comment. Besides Gan’s death, the health department says that another patient spent six days in the hospital in December following a procedure carried out by Patel. Despite not currently being allowed to practice, Patel continued to runs two surgeries in Connecticut, one in Enfield and one in Torrington. Both currently remain open with patients being treated by other dentists on staff. The website for Dr. Patel's Enfield Family Dental features several videos claiming people of all ages can benefit from his state-of-the-art compassionate care. ‘We have the technology to give you a smile you can be proud of at any age,’ Patel said in one of the videos. Nowhere on the site does it state that Patel is not currently allowed to practice following his suspension. The board will decide on June 18 whether to revoke Patel's license, suspend it for an additional amount of time or clear him of these charges and reinstate the license.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Connecticut judge has blasted the 22-year-old Quinnipiac University student accused of calling in two bomb threats to her college's graduation ceremony and set her bail at $10,000. Judge Philip A. Scarpellino said Danielle Shea caused panic for thousands for 'very, very selfish, minimal reasons' reasons. Shea told police she didn't want her mother to find out she hadn't been attending class in the spring and would not be graduating - despite taking thousands of dollars from her family to pay for her education. Scroll down for video . Behind bars: Bail for Danielle Shea, 22, was set at $10,000 at her arraignment today in a Connecticut courtroom . Shea was still wearing the blue summer dress she put on under her graduation gown. She was at the ceremony when she was arrested Sunday . Evacuation: Up to 5,000 people had to flee the main quad at the Quinnipiac University commencement after Shea called in bomb threats . 'I'm understanding that the whole year was a lie,' the furious judge told Shea, according to the Hartford Courant. Authorities say Shea can't account for the money that her mother gave her. When graduation arrived this weekend, Shea panicked when relatives didn't see her name on the graduation roster, they said. According to police, Shea made two calls to the university's public safety department. In the first, about 20 minutes before the start of the 6 p.m. graduation ceremony, she stated there was a 'bomb in the library,' said police. In the second call, about 20 minutes later, police said Shea warned 'Several bombs are on campus' and noted 'You haven't cleared out graduation. That's not a good idea.' The ceremony had to be moved from the main campus to TD Bank Arena because of the threats. However, graduation proceeded as normal - just 90 minutes late . Confession: Danielle Shea of Quincy, Massachusetts, admitted making the threats after being arrested at the indoor campus athletic arena, the TD Bank Sports Center, where commencement was taking place . Hamden and university police identified Shea using the telephone number she'd called from and then found her at the arena. She was wearing her graduation cap and gown, which she had apparently bought to keep up the ruse with her family. In court on Monday, she was still wearing a floral blue and white dress that she had on under her gown. She has been charged with first degree threatening and falsely reporting an incident. University spokesman John Morgan said 388 students were part of the commencement ceremony for the College of Arts and Sciences. It was delayed 90 minutes due to the threats. Two earlier ceremonies were held at 9 a.m. and 2 p.m.","Danielle Shea, 22, was ordered held on $10,000 bail .

"By . Lydia Warren . A mother has unexpectedly received a letter her son wrote as part of a school project before he was killed in a car crash. Gail Sharp, from Andersonville, Tennessee, said she was shocked - but ultimately grateful - when the letter addressed to her son, Cameron, arrived in the mail around Mother's Day. She recognized his handwriting on the envelope, and when she opened it, she discovered a short note that he had written while attending Norris Middle School on May 22, 2007, when he was 12.

Night at the Museum. My favorite teacher is Mr. Cawood.' His teacher at the time, Dale Caldwell, explained to WBIR that the letter had been part of a class project in which students wrote letters to their future selves. They were encouraged to write about their favorite things in life - such as friends or school activities - and write down their life goals. Mr Caldwell said he would then post the letters to their homes as they were about to graduate high school so that they could reflect on their good times or see whether their goals had changed.

"By . Ryan Gorman . Tens of thousands of dead fish floated into a southern California harbor this weekend because the water was depleted of oxygen, experts believe. Anchovies, sting rays and other dead marine life numbering as many as 70,000 blanketed the surface of Marina Del Rey Saturday afternoon. The layer of fish sent birds into a feeding frenzy and bait fisherman scrambling to snag as much free bait as they could before work crews cleaned up the mess – it also created a foul odor that permeated the air. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Mass kill: More than 70,000 dead fish floated to the surface of Marina del Rey this weekend . Mass grave: Some of the thousands of dead fish were found floating in Marina del Rey this weekend . Oxygen starved: The Los Angeles County Sheriff's office said the dead anchovies, stingrays and even an octopus rose to the surface at a section of the harbor Saturday evening . ‘It was like a Hitchcock movie,’ Michael Quill told KABC. ‘There were so many birds diving into the water and feeding. You could see the silver of the fish underwater, it was crazy.’ Several people speculated that warmer weather may have caused an algae bloom leading to a lack of oxygen that doomed the fish. Benjamin Kay, a marine biologist, told the station called the inlet an ‘oxygen dead zone,’ and said that heated water ‘can't hold oxygen as normal as if it were cooler, then we get these massive fish kills.‘This is a classic harbor event.’ Marine activist Matthew King, of Heal the Bay, told KNBC that ‘hot weather always has been associated with low oxygen levels in the water.’ Gold mine: A fisherman sets adrift to scoop up as much as he can . 'A classic harbor event': Marine biologists believe a lack of oxygen in the water, caused by this week's heat wave, may have led to the massive fish kill .

Massive effort: A worker shown among the hundreds of garbage bags of dead fish hauled from the site . The disturbing deaths occur almost once a year, the marine biologist argued, but at least one long-time resident in the community about four miles from Los Angeles International Airport disagreed. ‘I’ve been here for about 20 years and this is the first time I’ve seen a fish kill like this one,’ Tom Difloure told KTLA. Workers had cleaned up most of the dead fish, and their unbearable stench by late Sunday, KNBC reported. About 175 garbage bags weighing a combined 7,000 pounds were taken away. But the horrific smell lingered and questions remained. Local officials were not able to be immediately reached by MailOnline, and they have not given an official cause of the kill-off.","About 70,000 dead fish, sting rays and other marine life washed into the suburban California harbor over the weekend .

"By . Jennifer Newton . The US Supreme Court has ruled that a copyright lawsuit over the 1980 Oscar-winning film 'Raging Bull' can go ahead despite the movie being more than 30 years old. The film, starring Robert De Niro as Jake LaMotta and directed by Martin Scorsese, is the story of a boxer who has a self-destructive attitude and obsessive rage. Frank Petrella collaborated with Mr LaMotta on a book and two screenplays, which is said to have inspired the movie. He died in 1981, passing copyright on to his daughter, Paula. Scroll down for video . Robert De Niro played the lead character Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull, with Frank Petrella said to have inspired the screenplay for the story . She tried to sue movie studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 2009 seeking royalties due to the continuing commercial use of the film, but the case was dismissed saying the delay of nearly two decades of bringing the case was unreasonable. However, the Supreme Court has now reversed the ruling giving Ms Petrella the chance to resurrect her lawsuit. The decision is said to be a blow to movie studios, which have long relied on the legal doctrine of unreasonable delay to prevent distant relatives and estates from bringing copyright claims years or decades after movies have been released. Federal copyright law allows people to bring copyright claims within three years of an infringing act. Ms Petrella's claim fell within that time because the studio continued to release the film on DVD and other formats for years and every new release essentially reset the clock for copyright purposes. MGM argue that she delayed filing her case on purpose in hopes of getting more money, saying she waited until after the 25th anniversary of the movie in 2005 to press her claim. But allowing the suit to go forward, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said: 'There is nothing untoward about waiting to see whether an infringer is making money, so that litigation is worth the candle . 'It will put at risk only a fraction of the income MGM has earned during that period and will work no unjust hardship on innocent third parties, such as consumers who have purchased copies of Raging Bull. Mr Petrella's daughter Paula believes she is entitled to royalties from the film, pictured here, starring Mr De Niro, left and Joe Pesci, right . In dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer said the legal doctrine of unreasonable delay should apply to Ms Petrella's case because she waited 18 years after renewing her copyright to file a lawsuit. The effect of delaying legal action can give plaintiffs an unfair advantage in a copyright claim as witnesses die and memories fade, Breyer said, and should be a viable defence. Groups including the Motion Picture Association of America, Consumer Electronics Association, DirecTV and TiVo sided with MGM, arguing that it's unfair to allow plaintiffs to wait years or decades to file copyright claims while studios invest millions in their products. Ms Petrella won support from groups including the Authors Guild and the Songwriters Guild of America in her case concerning the film Raging Bull . But Ms Petrella won support from groups including the Authors Guild and the Songwriters Guild of America. They argued that the rolling three-year copyright protection is fair to artists and gives them incentive to create their works . Jan Constantine, general counsel for the Authors Guild said: 'This is definitely a victory for the little guy who don't have teams of lawyers and boundless financial resources. While Brad Newberg, a copyright law expert at the Reed Smith law firm in Northern Virginia added: 'What you have now is the ability for a plaintiff to come out of the woodwork and say that some creative work that was a hit in the 70s, 80s or 90s belonged to them. 'I would say there's now going to be an explosion of these types of cases.'

Tragic: Brendan Houston, 6, was killed in Shreveport on Thursday after being struck down and killed by the school bus that dropped him home . Horrific: Brenden died shortly after being struck by this school bus on Thursday. He wore tie shoes to school instead of Velcro . 'He wasn't paying attention because he was in his own world. That's how he lived. He didn't cause it, the bus driver didn't cause it, all the things surrounding it didn't cause it,' heartbroken mother Jennifer Houston told KTAL-TV. 'It happened, it was an accident, and we'll never get him back, but he'll be in our hearts forever.' The community has responded to the tragedy with an outpouring of support for the Houston family. Brenden had seven brothers and sisters - including a twin sister. Handwritten cards from Brenden's classmates have showed up at the Houston family's door. More than 20 teachers from Brenden's school came to his bedside at the hospital to pray for him. But Mrs Houston spoke out the day after her son's death to support Ms Stevens, the 59-year-old driver who has been suspended pending a police investigation. 'People just need to understand, things line up like that sometimes and there's nothing we can do about it,' she said. Brendan Houston, who has a twin sister, was described as a child who was 'always smiling' 'It doesn't make it hurt any less. But blaming somebody that's in as much pain as we are.... Two people are victims here. She is one of them. She's a grandmother and she loves those kids. Brenden was one of her favorites; he sat behind her everyday.' Brenden's grandfather repeated those sentiments at a memorial service for him on Monday. 'We certainly want to extend to her our love and support and total forgiveness,' Randy Riley told KSLA-TV. 'We have absolutely no animosity toward her. It's just what you call an accident and if the Lord allows it, we'll learn to deal with it if that's what his will is going to be. We're OK.' A roadside memorial has been created in Louisiana at the spot where a six-year-old boy was killed by his own school bus on Thursday afternoon. Witnesses say that Brendan Houston, a first-grade student at Herndon Magnet School, had alighted the bus in North Highland, a suburb of Shreveport, when he realized his shoe laces had been tied together. A local emergency worker is overcome at the scene . He stopped to fix the laces, but the bus driver, Debra Stevens, didn't see him and pulled out. Brendan was rushed to University Health in Shreveport, where he died of his injuries. 'I heard somebody say, ''Uh oh, oh, oh, oh,'' like that,' Sara Ward, whose house is near where the accident occurred on Winter Garden Drive, told KSLA.'Somebody was laying in the road. I thought maybe a child had passed out, or got knocked down.' It then became clear it was much more serious. 'His shoe laces had been tied together and when he got off, you know, he was shuffling and he reached down in front of the bus to untie his shoe laces. She did not see him,' Ward said. Ward added: 'The bus driver was out here (on the grass), right here next to my little bridge just in hysterics, in hysterics.' Shreveport Police say Stevens was taken to the hospital for routine toxicology tests, but that impairment is not suspected. Flowers and a stuffed animal have been left there near the intersection. Friends, classmates and neighbors are struggling to comprehend the sudden and tragic loss of the little boy, who was said to be 'always smiling'. Caddo Parish School Board spokesman Victor Mainiero said additional counselors were on hand to help students and staff.","Brenden Houston was killed by his school bus after getting off Thursday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Police were called to the Los Angeles home of V. Stiviano on Monday morning after someone reportedly smashed a window and attempted to get into the house. TMZ are reporting the incident happened around 11.30am and that the mistress of LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling was not at home at the time. The prowler is said to have broken a front window. Both Stiviano's sister and brother were in the house at the time and heard the commotion. 911: Police have confiremd there was an attempted break-in on Monday morning at the Beverly Hills home of V. Stiviano, the mistress of LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling . Stiviano, who has become something of a media sensation and is known for wearing visors over her face, was not at home at the time of the would-be break-in . It is understand the prowler was scared off when they realized Stiviano's brother and sister were inside the house, on the 8400 block of Fourth St, at the time . When the would-be thief tried to jimmy open a second window, they were scared off after observing the people inside. However, TMZ are also reporting that no one at the home called 911 until 2.50pm, hours after the incident. Stiviano is the woman who leaked a phone conversation with Sterling that eventually had him banned from the National Basketball Association and slapped with a $2.5 million. While Stiviano denies having anything to do with the leak, the tapes had Sterling tell her not to bring black people to his games or pose with them in photos on Instagram. She had posed in a picture with basketball great Magic Johnson several weeks earlier. CNN reported Monday evening that Sterling has until May 27 to to respond the NBA after it 'initiated a charge' to terminate his ownership rights in the franchise. V. Stiviano, pictured right at the wheel of her Ferrari and wearing her customary visor . The Clippers owner will reportedly ask for a three-month extension to prepare his response. Under . league rules, Sterling's rights over the franchise can be terminated . only if 75 percent of the 29 team owners sustain the charge and vote for . him to sell. A lawsuit filed by Mr Sterling’s estranged wife of 50 years, Rochelle, claimed to show how the Clipper’s owner treated his girlfriend by lavishing her with a series of gifts including the Ferrari, two Bentleys, a Range Rover and a $1.4 million apartment. I'm sorry: Mr Sterling, pictured at a Clippers game last October, revealed he is sorry for the racist comments he made in recorded conversations with girlfriend V. Stiviano . At the center of the controversy: V. Stiviano (right) posted a picture of her and Magic Johnson on her Instagram, causing Sterling to get mad at her and telling her not to pose for pictures with black people . Miss Stiviano has described herself as being Sterling's 'confidante and friend'. During a television interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Sterling started by apologizing for his racist comments. 'I’m not a racist,' he told Cooper. 'I made a terrible, terrible . mistake.' 'I’m the guilty one for uttering those . terrible, ugly words.' But as the interview progressed he blamed the media for blowing his words out of proportion before going on an angry attack against Magic Johnson, one of the targets of his racist remarks. Barbara Walters interviewed V. Stiviano, pictured, about Donald Sterling's alleged racist comments . Sterling first said the former basketball star was a ‘good person’ but his tone quickly changed and he made a series of disparaging remarks about Johnson's HIV-positive status, dismissing his work in charity and business and saying he's not a proper role model for children. He then said he believed his estranged girlfriend duped him by recording their private conversations. ‘She would always use the word “black,”’ Mr. Sterling said of Stiviano. ‘That's a black girl, that's a black guy, this is black, that's black. So when she said to me I'm going to bring “four gorgeous black guys to the game,” players she was referring to either football or basketball, I was a little jealous maybe.’ The NBA swiftly punished Sterling following the release of the first recordings, banning him from the league for life and hitting him with a $2.5million fine. They may also force him to sell the team, and the NBA's Advisory/Fianance committee met by conference call last Wednesday to discuss the possible termination.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . When a media team devised a social experiment asking the Indian public to support their campaign to kill poor people, they expected much more of a backlash. But far from being disgusted, they found that some were more than willing to support the cause after taking their bogus appeal far too literally. Wearing a billboard declaring 'kill the poor', actor Nick Arya took to the streets of Connaught Place, a wealthy district of New Delhi, to gauge the public's reaction. Scroll down for video . Testing the social divide: Indian actor Nick Arya wears a billboard saying 'kill the poor' as part of an experiment to gauge the public's reaction on the streets of Delhi to their spoof campaign . Getting on board: One member of the public tells Mr Arya that the 'poor are responsible for all the crime' Insensitive reaction: The man then takes the campaign all too literally when he agrees to support Mr Arya in his bogus quest to kill the poor . In a video posted on YouTube created by YTV Network India, he is . seen explaining their appeal to one man who readily agrees, adding: . 'Poor are responsible for all the crime.' Two . other men appear unmoved when Mr Arya details how they can donate to . the fake organisation and then they would 'kill them (poor people).' He . also struggles to gain the attention of two police officers, who do no . more than ask him politely to leave without taking any further action. This was even after Mr Arya explained to them how the group would use poor people's body parts to their advantage. Supportive: Another member of the public appears to side with the campaign by admitting the idea was 'really good', although it's not clear whether he was thought it was either a metaphor or tongue-in-cheek . Political statement: When Mr Arya explains to the man that he is trying to spread the message, he replies that 'Congress has been doing this for 40-60 years' Money for 'murder': Mr Arya explains to these two gentlemen how his fake organisation works . Law and disorder: Mr Arya tries to grab the attention of a police officer by handing him a leaflet . Naman . Sharma, the CEO of media company U'th Time, which devised the . experiment, told MailOnline: 'The purpose of this social experiment was . to test whether citizens of India had genuine concern and care for the . poor. 'We knew that people would react strongly if our actor became a human billboard asking people to ""Kill The Poor"". 'But to our surprise a lot of people didn't seem to be appalled by the idea of an organisation trying to kill the poor. 'Instead, some of them even agreed with us and gave us ideas to execute our social experiment.' Nonplussed: Police officers listen in as Mr Arya explains how his fake group can use poor people's body parts . Told to move on: Police officers ask Mr Arya to leave the area, but take no other action over his campaign . People DO care: This man was among the few citizens who took issue with the experiment, swearing at Mr Arya and accusing of him of being 'mad' Some do, however, take issue with Mr Arya, with one man swearing at him and calling him 'mad'. Later . in the video, he swaps his 'Kill The Poor' billboard for one saying . 'Help The Poor' while rattling a tin to test the public's reaction to a . more positive appeal. But the team found that only one person donated any money. Mr . Sharma said: 'We were in for a big surprise when people reacted . insensitively to killing the poor and didn't even donate when we asked . them to help the poor. Role reversal: Later in the video, Nick swaps his 'Kill The Poor' billboard for one saying 'Help The Poor' while rattling a tin to test the public's reaction to a more positive appeal . 'Hypocritical of the public': The team found that only this man donated any money to the 'Help The Poor' appeal . 'This was, in a way, extremely hypocritical of the general public of our nation.' The campaign was similar to that carried out by a charity on the streets of London last month. It . featured a member of the The Pilion Trust, which helps the most . vulnerable in society, wearing a sandwich saying: 'F*** the poor'. The charity found that while Londoners did care about the plight of the poor, they weren't likely to stop to help.","Actor wears billboard saying 'kill the poor' in wealthy district of New Delhi .

"By . James Rush . Spanish police have said an increasing number of migrants are risking their lives by hiding above ferry engines in a bid to get to new lives in Europe. A pair of stowaways, aged 29 and 31, were caught this week after making the 20 mile journey from Tangier to southern Spain, just inches from the engine of a ferry. The pair were caught a week after a Moroccan man risked his life by balancing on a narrow metal platform above the propulsion system of a ferry. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A pair of stowaways, aged 29 and 31, were caught this week after making the journey from Tangier to southern Spain inches from the engine of a ferry . A Moroccan man risked his life by balancing on a narrow metal platform above the engine of a ferry last week . Omar Iziel, 20, had put on a wetsuit and managed to clamber into position before the ferry set off also from Tangier to the port of Tarifa, in the southern Spanish province of Cadiz. Two hours later after clinging on despite the cold and the rise and fall of the ship, the ferry arrived in Tarifa. But as the ferry reversed in order to dock, border guards spotted the stowaway and were waiting to arrest him when he swam ashore. Police confirmed the Moroccan man did not have an entry visa and he was arrested and jailed, pending being deported back to Morocco. Spanish police spokesman Martial Portillo Alfaro, 43, said: 'It was incredibly dangerous and if he had slipped it would have meant certain death. 'Yet it is an increasingly common way for people to try and enter the country, in fact this was the 31st person caught trying this trick so far this year.' Police released the video of the failed attempt to warn people that they knew about the stunt, and that vessels are being checked each time as they start to come into port .

"By . Zoe Szathmary . Gregg Steinhafel, who stepped down from his position as President and CEO of Target earlier this month in the wake of last year's data breach and the company's shaky Canadian expansion, will receive an estimated $15.9million in his severance package. Target released the numbers in its annual proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. Fired: Ex-Target CEO Gregg Steinhafel, pictured, will receive a severance package worth an estimated $15.9million . Steinhafel will receive $7.2million in severance payments and nearly $10million from an 'officer deferred compensation plan' Target froze in 1996. Steinhafel was eligible because he joined the company in 1979. The severance package also includes nearly $4million in stock. Despite these amounts, Steinhafel will have to pay back $5.4million in retirement benefits. The package is worth an estimated $15.9million. The package's exact amount will be based on interest rates and Target's stock price on May 5, Steinhafel's last day on the job, according to the filing. Steinhafel's exit was listed in the proxy statement as 'an involuntary termination for reasons other than for cause.' Unhappy: Stockholder feedback said Steinhafel's pay 'was too high given Target's performance to peers' Steinhafel's total compensation was also cut by about a third. This year, Steinhafel received $12.9million in total compensation - considerably less than the $20.6million he received in 2012. His base salary was $1.5million for both years. Shareholders . felt that 'overall pay for our former CEO was too high given Target's . performance relative to peers,' the company said in the proxy. Steinhafel will continue to receive his full CEO salary and benefits through August 23, while he works as a company advisor during its transition period. Meanwhile, interim president and CEO John Mulligan's salary will increase on May 22 from $700,000 to $1million and he will receive a one-time grant of restricted stock units.","Gregg Steinhafel's severance package is worth an estimated $15.9million .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated Press . When most 13-month-olds are picky, it's all about taste. For Maehlee Her, it's a matter of life and death. Little Maehlee has a rare digestive disorder that makes her white blood cells attack her body every time she swallows food. Her desperate parents have been able to find one foot that doesn't cause her to break out in horrible fits of vomiting and diarrhea - squash. Struggle: Parents Marci Flory and Kao Her are desperate to find new foods that their daughter Maehlee Her can tolerate - so far it's only squash . Maehlee had to be fed medical food through a tube that ran from her nose to her stomach for most of her life. But she can now eat squash . Mother Marci Flory and father Kao Her tell the Topeka Capital-Journal that they were lucky to find that one thing their daughter could eat. For the first several months of her life, Maehlee lived in nonstop misery as her body attacked itself every time she swallowed any food. 'She didn't sleep, and she started refusing to eat,' Ms Flory told the newspaper. At one point, she hadn't eaten anything for 15 hours straight. Even a single morsel could set her body against her. On recent afternoon, Maehlee found a doughnut crumb at her grandmother's house and put it in her mouth. Vomiting and screaming for hours followed almost immediately. Topeka doctors told Mr Flory and Mr Her that Maehlee simply had a colic or bad acid reflux. Happy baby: Keeping Maehlee healthy and happy is difficult. But it's easier now that her parents have found one food she can tolerate . The medical food that still makes up most of Maehlee's nutrition isn't covered by her insurance and costs up to $900 a month . But, after months of enduring their daughter's screams, the family took Maehlee to Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri, where doctors found . white patches in her throat and a biopsy showed high levels of white . blood cells. 'The white blood cells are wired wrong, and when children with this . condition eat food, the white blood cells come in to fight off the food . because they think the food is a foreign invader,' Ms Flory explained to . the Capital-Journal. Doctors said Maehlee had eosinophilic esophagitis, a . digestive disorder. They told the parents to . take her off all food and put her on Elecare, an amino acid-based . medical food. For months, the Elecare had to be fed directly into Maehlee's stomach through a tube in her nose. Now, she can drink the food through a bottle. But it doesn't taste very good. 'It tastes like cardboard. It's the most disgusting stuff I've ever tasted,' Ms Flory said. Maehlee used to cry all day - every single day because of the pain that eating caused her. She even started refusing all food . Her parents have slowly but surely been trying out simple foods to see whether Maehlee can tolerate them. It's no mystery when something doesn't agree with her. She screams and cries and throws up. So far, the only thing that her parents have found is squash. However, they are currently testing her with white potatoes, apples and bananas - all in very small quantities. Ms Flory's insurance covers the doctors visits, but it does not cover the medical food - which Maehlee still needs to survive. It costs Ms Flory and Mr Her up to $900 a month. Meanwhile, the girl's parents hide their own eating from their daughter because she wants to have what they're eating. 'We have to hide it from her, which is not very fair,' Ms Flory said. 'With all the appointments, it's a struggle to keep her feeling good every day and to keep up with all our everyday business.'","Maehlee Her is 13 months old and has eosinophilic esophagitis .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Hugo Carrasco has lived in the U.S. since he was ten years old, having entered illegally with his family, and is now married to an American with whom he has two children. Still, he lives in fear of being deported to his native Mexico at any given time, having already suffered one close shave which nearly tore his family apart, an experience he writes about for Salon.com. In 2011, Mr Carrasco was arrested and charged with identity theft - having 'made up' a social security number in order to gain employment - and spent 90 days in county jail while his wife was pregnant with their first child. Fragile future: Hugo Carrasco (right) has lived in the U.S. illegally since he was ten years old, and has an American wife, Leslie (left), and two children (pictured) he is afraid he might be separated from . 'After years of complicated legal issues, I live in limbo,' he says of his release from prison three years ago. 'The authorities could reopen my case and order my deportation at any time.' Mr Carrasco's life in America begun when he was smuggled across the border from Chihuahua, Mexico - a dangerous region fraught with drug wars - to Douglas, Arizona as a ten-year-old boy, along with his siblings and mother. He says he remembers very little about the journey but recalls his family's excitement at the prospect of being reunited with his father, a construction worker who had been working in Arizona illegally for several months. Mr Carrasco admits that while growing up he was aware his family was 'undocumented', he didn't comprehend the full weight of that status until he reached high school. Choices: After growing up knowing he was 'different' Mr Carrasco (pictured with Leslie) 'made up' a social security number to gain employment and was caught and sent to prison for 90 days . 'I started to feel pretty bad about myself, like I wasn’t good enough, because I wasn’t like the other kids,' he says. 'I couldn’t ask a girl out on a date, because I couldn’t drive. What if she wanted to see an R-rated movie, and I didn’t have the proper ID to go?' Regardless, Mr Carrasco tried to live as normal a life as possible, making up a fake social security number, which 'didn't belong to anyone else' he points out, in order to score a job as a bartender. 'I started to feel pretty bad about myself, like I wasn’t good enough, because I wasn’t like the other kids' He also worked hard as a volunteer for a charity, Young Life, where he mentored 'at-risk' high school students, and where he ended up meeting his wife, Leslie. Not long after the happy couple had saved enough money to buy their first home, the infamous Sheriff Joe Arpaio - known for his raids on restaurants to expose illegal immigrants, and for once arresting a six-year-old girl - tracked Mr Carrasco down and sent him to jail. Worry: Due to his conviction, Mr Carrasco can't apply for citizenship via any of the usual routes, like through his marriage, and he lives in fear that he could be deported at any time . He says it was the day his 'world ended'. With the help of a good lawyer, Mr Carrasco was released from jail in time for his son's birth and put on a 'home-monitoring program.' 'If I’m sent back to Chihuahua, my . children won’t have their father by their side, and my wife won’t have . the support she needs and deserves' He has since welcomed his second child, a daughter, and is now an advocate for an immigration reform; meeting with members of Congress to share his story. He is unable to apply for citizenship through his marriage - a common route - or through the government's DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program due to his previous conviction for using falsified documents to work. Mr Carrasco is one of an estimated 11.5 million 'unauthorized immigrants' residing in the U.S., according to the Department of Homeland Security. Of that number, over 600,000 illegal immigrants were forcibly deported in 2102, the latest figure available, and Mr Carrasco is still terrified that he could join that statistic. 'If I’m sent back to Chihuahua, my children won’t have their father by their side, and my wife won’t have the support she needs and deserves,' he says. 'Who could ever call that justice?'","Hugo Carrasco was born in Chihuahua, known as Mexico's 'murder capital'

"By . James  Nye . Troubled discount retailer Target need look no further than the state of the shelves in its own stores to comprehend its huge $2 billion loss in Canada since opening there in 2013. Launching north of the border with much fanfare last year, the embattled one-stop-shopping giant appears to have fundamental problems simply keeping its shelves adequately stocked - judging by these stark and miserable pictures taken at an unidentified Canadian Target outlet. Having already endured the disastrous aftermath of losing millions of customer's credit information to a data-breach before Christmas, which cost CEO Gregg Steinhafel his job, Target's profits are down 46-percent this last quarter. Empty: It may have been a good day at the Target store, but judging by the equally unstocked shelves behind it seems they have just been left untended . Indeed, the photographs of empty clothing racks, and shelves boasting 'unbeatable prices' on non-existent merchandise, suggest that Target's goal of generating $6 billion a year in sales in Canada by 2017 is an optimistic goal. In some instances the store's Canadian display's resemble a flea market in terms of organization and with traditional strong performers at the bedding department and toys woefully understocked. Market experts have scratched their heads as to why the discount chain is suffering so badly in Canada. The launch in 2013 was huge, even for a firm boasting revenue of $72 billion and more than 300,000 staff across the US and Canada. Nothing to see or sell: Shelves in the unidentified Target store in Canada seem depressingly empty . Let down: Bedding is usually one of Target's best sellers - although you wouldn't be able to tell from this picture which shows a woefully understocked shelf . Renowned for its 'cheap chic', Target opened 123 stores in Canada and the first mistake they made is claimed to be buying out the premises of the now defunct Zellers chain, whose store leases it bought in 2011 for $1.8 billion. The trouble with that was, the stores  were often smaller than those in the United States, and found in down-market malls rather than up-and-coming retail destinations. Some analysts said that Target's Canadian woes began with that while the company's inability to stock the stores with items Canadians want at the prices they expected is what ultimately alienated customers. Indeed, it seems in some cases Target is not even stocking the shelves with any items, let alone products Canadians do not even want. No toys for the kids: Rows of empty and mismanaged model cars and the latest games for children . Write caption here . 'Canadians were expecting the U.S. Target experience,' said Doug Stephens, president of Retail Prophet Consultants in Toronto. 'Instead they got Zellers with lipstick.' Canadian shoppers also complain that prices are higher than they thought they would be, that there's inadequate selection of goods on the shelves, and that the company's supply chains don't meet the expectations drummed up by its advertising. 'For Target, every time they have something on sale in the flyer, they don't have it when you get to the store,' said Katie Witzell, 31, who was shopping at a Toronto Wal-Mart with her toddler. Toronto interior designer Christine Tavares, 40, shopping at a Target store where some shelves were oddly barren of merchandise, said, 'I was here within the first week when it opened, and I was so disappointed. The shelves were empty. We were expecting what we saw in the States.' It won't be easy for Target to sweeten the sour first impression it has made on Canadian shoppers, who were familiar with the retailer's U.S. stores and expected more selection and better prices. 'They over-promised and under-delivered and they're wearing two big shiners for it,' said Jim Danahy, chief executive of consultancy CustomerLAB and director of the Centre for Retail Leadership at York University's Schulich School of Business. HQ: This is the Target store and training facility in Guelph, Ontario - (not the store featured in the photographs) Not fully stocked: Barbie is a mainstay of children's toy merchandise . Running low: Target reported in February that its fourth-quarter profit fell 46 percent on a revenue decline of 5.3 percent as the breach scared off customers . Target says it's working on the problems, though fixing them may take time. 'Again, it's not done, it's not perfect, and it's not everyday,'' said Eric Hausman, a Target spokesman. 'On any given day, in any given time, we think it's incrementally better than it was several weeks ago, several months ago and that's what we're looking for.' The company expects $300 million to $400 million in capital spending in Canada this year, down from the peak of more than $1 billion in 2013, to fix the stores, John Mulligan, Target's former chief financial officer and now interim chief executive, said in February. Mulligan said last year that the stores were in very poor condition, with $10 million to $11 million in renovations expected for each location. It's an investment that may yet pay off with customers who laud the clean stores and customer service they are used to in the U.S. 'I settle for a few items that I can get here rather than go somewhere else like Wal-Mart,' said Raeanna Guitard, a little person who needs help reaching high shelves, as she shopped at a Target in Toronto. 'I won't go to Wal-Mart unless I need to. It's unorganized and no one can ever assist me.' Spot one: There are scant opportunities on these shelves to pick up any merchandise, let alone get 70 percent off the product . But Guitard, a government worker, also still shops at Target in the United States once a month, saying the furniture, clothing and household selection is better than it is in Canada. Canadians are used to paying more for goods than in the U.S. and the disparity is more or less tolerated. It is often blamed on currency fluctuations, taxes, tariffs and transportation costs. Hani Shabbir, 26, a stay-at-home mother of two, shopping with her infant son, said she likes Target because it is conveniently located and has good products, but she finds the shelves are often empty. 'This one is more expensive. Also, there are a lot of people near here, so you have to be the first to grab things, if you're late you'll miss it, it's gone,' she said. 'My son has colic, and we need gripe water, and it's never in stock. It has been three weeks, and there is no gripe water -- we want the right kind. We end up running all over looking for it, and come back here a few times but it is never in stock.' Still, there is hope fashionistas drawn by Target's reputation as a treasure trove for fun, cheap clothes and higher-quality merchandise than Wal-Mart may extend their patience a little longer. It's just up to Target to deliver. Katie Witzell, the Wal-Mart shopper, said she gave Target five or six tries when it first opened, and may give it another. 'The only thing I like at Target, why I may go back, is their sheets,' she said. 'They do have good quality bedding.'","Depressing pictures of empty shelves taken at unidentified Target store in Canada reveal discount retailers struggles north of the border .

"By . James  Nye . A leisurely stroll along a Florida beach threw up an elephant-sized opportunity for Todd Unbehagen to take a glorious and very unusual selfie. Capturing the huge creature wading knee-deep off the shores of Gulf Coast Redington Beach on Saturday, Unbehagen joined dozens of other perplexed onlookers in wondering just how an elephant had managed to end up there. The amusing picture spread across social media and the lady responsible for the gentle giant's appearance over the weekend has come forward to explain why she rented Judy the elephant and how, amazingly, it was completely legal. Scroll Down for Video . Not an every day sight: Judy the elephant is seen in the background of Redington Beach, Florida in this picture taken by Todd Unbehagen on Saturday . Claudia McCorkle was five-years-old when she turned down the chance to ride an elephant 55-years ago in Fort Lauderdale. She never got over that regret and decided in February that when she celebrated her 60th birthday party on Saturday that she would pay $4,500 to enjoy four hours in the company of Judy the elephant. 'Elephants are so symbolic,' said Claudia McCorkle to Tampa Bay News. 'Symbolic of karma and such wonderful qualities as loyalty and love, memory and longevity.' Happy birthday to me: Claudia McCorkle hired Judy for her 60th birthday after missing out on an elephant ride when she was five-years-old which she never forgave herself for . Look at me! A party goer at Claudia McCorkle's 60th rides Judy and seems to thoroughly enjoy the experience . Deciding to stun her guests with Judy, Claudia contacted Orlando based party specialists, Xtreme Entertainment to rent the 58-year-old elephant. Indeed, despite common sense dictating that some laws may have been broken in carting an elephant to a quiet Gulf Coast beach on a weekend, it turns out that the city commission was well aware and had approved. Back in February, McCorkle registered her special request to have Judy and the city commission even allowed her an empty lot to move the elephant from Gulf Boulevard to North Redington. Obviously, for the successful realtor, it helps if you know the town mayor, especially if he is to be a guest at the party. RSVP: Claudia's 'Big' bash party invitation's gave guests some indication that Judy might be the star guest . Elephant jokes: Well-wishers leave humorous messages for Claudia after their time with Judy the elephant on Saturday . 'Mayor Nick Simons referred to the letter from Claudia McCorkle and her request to be able to have an elephant on her beach property for a birthday party,' city meeting minutes from February read. 'Motion passed with all ayes.' Judy, who weighs, 6,200 pounds, also gave rides to some of the 40 guests as a pianist played the Elephant Walk inside McCorkle's beachfront home. Judy elephant waded in around sunset, and her presence stunned other beach-goers. Mr. Unbehagen was with his family when he shot the video and selfie. 'We were walking down the beach, and someone had a private party at their beach house with an elephant. It was at North Redington Beach, Florida. So, we stopped for a while to take pictures. You don't see this every day!!!""which he later posted to Facebook.' Born in Thailand, Judy's trainer Bones Craig said that she loves the ocean. 'There's days that she seems to like it and days that she doesn't,' said Bones, who has owned Judy since 1977.","Beachgoers on Saturday were stunned to see an Indian elephant wading in the waters of Redington Beach on Florida's Gulf Coast .

No adult saw the confrontation, and Garcia-Bratcher apparently had not checked in with the school office before coming on campus, authorities said. The young witnesses later told a deputy the mother threatened the boy about bullying her daughter. The boy then ran to a classroom, told a teacher and the two went to the office where school officials took pictures of the injuries. The staff at the school took photos of red marks on the boy's neck as soon as they learned about the alleged assault, authorities said. Garcia-Bratcher was arrested on a charge of felony child abuse. She was released from jail after posting a $30,000 bail. School district officials are also investigating the possible bullying. A telephone number for a Delia Bratcher was disconnected. But on a Facebook page that said it belonged to Bratcher, she posted that she was hurt by the accusation and asserted that 'the truth will be told.' Lt. Mark Essick told the Santa Rosa Press-Democrat that deputies were looking into the bullying claims but have not substantiated them. Mixed views: News of Ms Garcia-Bratcher's arrest was met with mixed reaction as it circulated through Twitter and other social media sites . 'It's pretty unreasonable for a parent to go storming on campus like this,' Essick said. 'You can see fingerprints on his neck. 'To take it into her own hands was absolutely the wrong thing to do.' However, news of Ms Garcia-Bratcher's arrest was met with mixed reaction as it circulated through social media sites. One Twitter user, identified only as Greg, wrote: 'My mom would've done the same thing 25 years ago and did. Beware bullies.' Wayne Street wrote on another site: 'Good for Mom. Hopefully the kid will get the message.' Matthew Hayward wrote on Santa Rosa's The Press Democrat newspaper comment section: 'I have three kids, and the idea of them getting pushed around makes me upset. 'However, we, as adults, have to set the example for children. 'The kids who witnessed this event will think vigilante justice is ok. She could have made her point, without putting her hands on the kid. She resorted to violence, which puts her on par with the bully.'","Delia Garcia-Bratcher, 30, allegedly came to Olivet Charter Elementary School in Northern California at around lunchtime on Friday and confronted the boy, 12 .

"By . Associated Press . A Mississippi man who sent letters dusted with the poison ricin to President Barack Obama and other officials has been sentenced to spend 25 years in prison. James Everett Dutschke was sentenced Monday after telling the judge that he had changed his mind about wanting to withdraw his guilty plea in the case. In addition to 25 years in jail, Duetschke was also sentenced to five years of supervised release and remains in federal custody. Changing stories: James Everett Dutschke initially entered a guilty plea, then tried to change it last week, but decided against that and was sentenced to 25 years in jail today . Dutschke waived his right to appeal. He wasn't fined or ordered to pay restitution because he doesn't have enough money, federal prosecutor Chad Lamar said. The 42-year-old Tupelo resident sent the letters to President Obama, Republican Senator Roger Wicker and Mississippi judge Sadie Holland in what prosecutors have said was an elaborate plot to frame a rival, Paul Kevin Curtis. Poisoned letters addressed to Obama and Wicker were intercepted before delivery, but one letter reached Holland. She was not harmed. U.S. District Judge Sharion Aycock had already signaled that she intended to accept the original plea, and Lamar said that Aycock found the outcome to be balanced. ‘She found our agreement to be a fair sentence and one that represented the severity of the crime committed,’ Lamar said after the hearing. The 42-year-old Tupelo man complicated matters on May 13 when he told Judge Aycock that he wanted to withdraw the plea agreement he made with federal prosecutors in January. Rivals: Dutschke, a martial arts instructor . (left), tried framing his longtime enemy Paul Kevin Curtis (right), an . Elvis impersonator, of sending the letters last spring . In a half-hour speech, the former martial arts instructor told the judge that federal prosecutors lied when they said he made the poison and about finding his DNA on a dust mask. He renewed accusations that Elvis impersonator and entertainer Curtis had committed the crimes. Curtis was initially arrested by federal prosecutors but was abruptly released after officials found no physical evidence of ricin in his home. Although he pointed the finger at Curtis, Dutschke also argued last week that had only used castor beans to make a fertilizer that couldn't hurt anyone, not a true form of the poison ricin. Bound for bars: Dutschke sent the letters to Obama, Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker and Mississippi judge Sadie Holland in what prosecutors have said was an elaborate plot to frame Curtis (pictured in April 2013) At the end of the May 13 hearing, Judge Aycock had told Dutschke to file a formal motion asking to withdraw his plea. A decision on that motion would have been up to the judge, but Dutschke had a change of heart and on Friday, defense attorney Ken Coghlan sent a letter to Aycock saying his client would stick with the guilty plea. The prosecutor said he didn't know what prompted the reversal ‘other than he changed his mind and did not want to withdraw the plea.’ Pulling back the plea could have opened Dutschke to a possible life sentence as well as a longer sentence in a state court proceeding where he had pleaded guilty to fondling charges. State prosecutors have recommended that Dutschke serve his proposed 20-year sentence in the unrelated fondling case at the same time he serves any penalty on the federal charges.","James Dutschke has been sentenced to 25 years behind bars and five years probation after sending ricin-laced letters to government officials .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A close aide of newly-elected Indian prime minister Narendra Modi is tipped to join his government despite facing three charges of murder. Amit Shah, a former minister in Mr Modi’s home state of Gujerat, helped mastermind the election victory that swept the controversial Hindu nationalist to power on Friday. He was appointed to run the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) campaign in Uttar Pradesh, India’s biggest state. Amit Shah (centre) is facing charges linked to the killing of three alleged Muslim terrorists in Gujerat . His efforts secured 71 of the 80 seats in the state - a significant proportion of the country's 543 MPs. The Congress party only secured 44 seats nationwide. As a reward, Shah is expected to be handed a top job in the new administration when it is announced today. Mr Shah faces murder charges linked to the killings by police of three alleged Muslim terrorists in Gujerat, where he was home minister. He denies the charges, which he says are politically motivated to discredit the new leadership. According to recent figures, India has a . record number of politicians facing criminal charges with more than a . third of acting officials. Mr Modi, who was chief minister in Gujerat, faced criticism in 2002 for not doing more to prevent the  slaughter of 2,000 Muslims in reprisal attacks in the state. He masterminded the campaign that gave Narendra Modi (pictured) a landslide victory on Friday . Yesterday, he held meetings with leaders at Gujarat Bhavan, a government guesthouse in Delhi. The official building will act as his residence until he moves into 7 Race Course Road, India’s equivalent to 10 Downing Street.

"By . Hayley Coyle . Novelist Adele Parks - whose latest project is from the perspective of a dementia sufferer . Her best-selling novels are normally filled with dilemmas involving love and romance. But a dinner party with friends prompted Adele Parks to deviate from the ‘chick lit’ genre she is known for and become the first author to write from the point of view of a dementia sufferer. Miss Parks found herself moved by the difficulties faced by several aquaintances struggling to help loved ones with the illness but afraid to speak about their battles openly. The 45-year-old has written 13 novels in 13 years, all of which have topped the Times Bestseller List, but it is Whatever It Takes which was released last year, that she regards as one of her ‘most rewarding projects’. The novel tells the tale of a young mother who moves to the countryside to be near her husband’s family and discovers that her mother-in-law has dementia. The narrative switches between telling the story from the perspective of Margaret who has Alzheimer’s and her daughter-in-law. Speakinmg about the novel for the first time and explaining the inspiration behind Whatever It Takes, Miss Parks said she was moved by the heartbreak of a friend who had had to have her father tagged and placed in a care home as he battled the late stages of dementia. She said:  ‘The very first nugget of an idea came when I was at a dinner party. Towards the end of the evening one of the guests kept getting phone calls about her father.  We asked if she was alright then she started talking about him and how he was in the late stages of dementia. 'She told us a horror story about how he had gone missing from his care home. He’d left then forgotten where he lived. 'Then she said we’ve actually got him tagged now and I feel terrible. People say it’s taken away his liberty but she said, I just want him to be safe. My heart was breaking for her. 'Soon after that a close friend of mine told me his mother wasn’t well but no one knew what it was. Then after dozens of tests it turned she had Alzheimer’s. 'So it was these two incidents that started the idea for the book.’ Around 800,000 people in the UK have been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. Miss Parks, a married mother of one, spent months meticulously researching and spending lots of time with dementia sufferers and their families before publishing her book for public consumption last year. The 45-year-old has written 13 novels in 13 years, all of which have topped the Times Bestseller List, but it is Whatever It Takes which was released last year, that she regards as one of her 'most rewarding projects' Miss Parks, whose other bestselling titles include Husbands and Playing Away,  said: ‘I’m the first author to do this I believe, write from the point of view of a dementia sufferer in mainstream fiction. ‘I absolutely wanted to write from the Alzheimer sufferer’s perspective. It was essential to me – I didn’t want to write in a way that was just what everyone else thinks it must be like. The author's latest novel Whatever It Takes, which was released last year . ‘And as far as I’m aware and as far as people who have written to me, lots of people – either those suffering from Alzheimer’s or families and friends – all have said we hadn’t come across a book written like this before.’ And her depiction was ‘exactly right’, she said. ‘I described dementia as a ‘black smudge’ on your memory… absolutely horrifying. ‘And the sufferers I spoke to said that’s exactly what it’s like, a bit of your memory that’s just been rubbed out but  you know used to be there’, Miss Parks explained. She said: ‘What was interesting, and very important to me, is that without exception everyone wanted to open up [about ementia] because it’s almost a secret they feel they have to keep. ‘There was a definite sense of relief just being able to talk about it.’ According to a poll carried out by the Alzheimer’s Society, to mark Dementia Awareness Week which runs until May 24, 41 per cent of those affected by the disease said they were keeping their concerns about it bottled up. A further 64 per cent of the 1,043 people polled admitted to waiting six months or more after noticing symptoms before seeking professional help. Miss Parks was speaking to raise awareness about Dementia Awareness Week which is organised annually by the Alzheimer’s Society.","Adele Parks, 45, is known for her best-selling 'chick lit' novels .

"By . Lucy Crossley . 'Horrified': Giving evidence at her assault trial, former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos described the publication of a sex tape as 'one of the worst times of my life' Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos told her assault trial that the leaking of her sex tape was 'one of the worst times' in her life. The singer claimed she had not known of the existence of the tape, which was made with an ex-boyfriend, and that celebrity blogger Savvas Morgan had been involved in it being leaked to the press. The 25-year-old spoke out about the tape while giving evidence at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court, where she is standing trial accused of assaulting Mr Morgan at V Festival in Essex last August. Writer Mr Morgan said he suffered swelling to the eye after the alleged incident involving the N-Dubz star at the Chelmsford festival site. Contostavlos denies an assault charge, while her assistant Gareth Varey, who is also standing trial, denies threatening behaviour. Giving evidence today, Contostavlos, wearing a black suit and black polo neck jumper, gave her occupation as 'singer and television personality'. She also told the court that Mr Morgan had a 'strange obsession' with her, and that while at V Festival he had called her a 'whore and a nobody', and made reference to her mother's mental illness. Asked by her barrister Jeremy Dein QC if she assaulted Mr Morgan, she said: 'Most definitely not.' Mr Dein then asked Contostavlos about the sex tape, which had been made with an ex-boyfriend. She said she found out Mr Morgan may have been involved in this. She added: 'I couldn’t confirm at the time that he was involved because I didn’t know at the time the tape existed. 'Once I knew, a couple of details made me believe he was involved a lot more than he made out.' Describing the publication of the sex tape, she went on: 'I was horrified - it was one of the worst times of my life. 'I recorded a video on YouTube explaining the situation and put it up online and posted it on my Twitter account. 'An . ex-boyfriend had taken what was supposed to be private footage of us . and many years later tried to sell it and put it online.' She said she held no grudge against Mr Morgan: 'There were many people involved. 'I feel that some of the things he . was doing were very mean, I didn’t like the man, but he was one of many . people who had issues or dramas with me. 'It’s part of my life and I’m pretty used to it by now.' Scroll down for video . Accused: The 25-year-old is on trial at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court with her assistant Gareth Varey (left), who is accused of threatening behaviour . Denial: Contostavlos said in her police interview that 'at no point' was she threatening or abusive towards Mr Morgan (right) at V Festival, and that she feared he may have been about to attack her . In a police statement read to the court earlier today, Contostavlos had said that Mr Morgan’s 'considerable ill-feeling and resentment' towards her stemmed . from an incident at the Whisky Mist nightclub in Mayfair, London, when . she asked security to request Mr Morgan to leave after he attempted to . join her in a VIP area. Describing . the incident to the court, she said she had been filming for The X . Factor with groups Little Mix and The Risk when Mr Morgan tried to join . their table. She said Chloe Green, star of Made in Chelsea and daughter of Topshop mogul Sir Philip Green, was with Mr Morgan. 'When I saw these people I had never . seen before I alerted the security guard that we were filming and asked . that they be removed from the table,' she added. Matthew McNiff, prosecuting, quoted part of her autobiography, Honest, in . which she describes how she suspected Ms Green had an affair with fellow . N-Dubz member and former boyfriend Fazer. She said: 'This came after the Whisky Mist incident.' Asked if she had come across such incidents before, she said: 'All the time. 'When . something comes with the job, when you make that decision, it becomes . part of your life and you just have to learn to get on with things and . have a certain amount of control of the situation. Celebrity: Giving evidence wearing a black suit and black polo neck jumper, Contostavlos, pictured arriving at court, gave her occupation as 'singer and television personality' 'At the time I didn’t actually know who he was until I was alerted by the tweets he was sending.' Contostavlos told the court she had no criminal record. She . said that on another occasion, while working at the luxury Mondrian . hotel in Los Angeles, she had been involved in an argument with Mr . Morgan. He claimed she was . making too much noise and as she tried to leave the argument, he . attempted to push his way through her bedroom door, Contostavlos said. Contostavlos told the court that Mr Morgan had a 'strange obsession' with her, and said that he had 'followed' her around the globe. 'For the past two years he has been causing drama in my life as much as . he can and has been following me to hotels across the world,' she said. 'It is something I have learned to deal with.' Describing the alleged attack at V Festival, Contostavlos, said the incident was nothing more than a 'playground slanging match' which had been used as part of Mr Morgan's 'vendetta' against her. 'This is my life on the line, my livelihood,' she said. 'I cannot believe it has been taken to this point and I'm standing here today.' Contostavlos said Mr Morgan had . attempted to follow her back to her Winnebago at the festival after she . had watched a performance by singer Beyonce when she asked him to stop. 'There was a point that I swore,' she added. Sex tape: Contostavlos told the court she had discovered that Mr Morgan may have been involved in the publication of her sex tape . 'At the start I was trying to be calm but this approach did not seem to work with him as he got more heated.' The singer, who claimed she kept her . hands behind her back during the confrontation, described how Mr Morgan . called her 'a slag, a whore and a nobody' and made reference to her . mother's mental illness. Earlier the court had been told, via Contostavlos's police statement, that Mr . Morgan had previously made 'unfounded and vicious' allegations against . both her and Varey, following the Whisky Mist incident. Referring . to the alleged assault backstage at V Festival, Contostavlos added: 'At . no point was I threatening or abusive towards him.' She said she saw Mr Morgan being restrained and struggling and feared he may attack her. Dispute: Contostavlos, pictured with Varey, told the court she had been involved in an argument with Mr Morgan in Los Angeles . Detective . Sergeant Amanda White told the court stars who witnessed the incident, . including singer and rapper Misha B, Mutya Buena of the Sugababes, . singer Alexandra Burke and rapper Wretch 32, had all been asked to give . police statements through their representatives, but none were provided. In his statement, Varey said neither he nor Contostavlos had attacked Morgan. 'Neither . of us would have done this as it was exactly the reaction he was . looking for so he could make unfounded allegations against her and me,' he added. Both of the defendants gave virtually identical accounts in pre-prepared statements to detectives. They refused to answer further questions. The pair said they knew Mr Morgan as he had sought to befriend them to obtain gossip for his blog. Varey told the court that the Festival was the first time Contostavlos had appeared in public since a front page story following a newspaper investigation into another matter. 'The eyes of the world were on her and every photographer wanted a picture of Tulisa,' he added. Describing the confrontation, he said Mr Morgan had raised his voice and been aggressive in an intimidating manner. But he said neither he nor Contostavlos had attacked him and the first he knew about the claim was when he was contacted by journalists the following day. 'Vas (Mr Morgan) is doing it to get his name in the paper,' he added. Varey said he had accepted a police caution for a previous incident in which he sent an email threatening to kill the personal assistant of Sun on Sunday investigative reporter, Mazher Mahmood, who is known as the Fake Sheikh. Yesterday Mr Morgan told District Judge Angus Hamilton that during the V Festival incident, Contostavlos raised her fists in the air and was swinging her arms. 'Everyone was jumping around trying to get at me, there was a lot going on,' he said. Prosecutor Matthew McNiff said the incident happened at 12.30am on August 18 as Mr Morgan was about to leave. He said Contostavlos accused Mr Morgan of stalking her, and swore at him. A third person, Jacqueline Moore, 39, . from Manchester, has admitted a public order offence in connection with . the incident. She was fined £130 yesterday. Contostavlos and Varey, 28, both of Friern Barnet, north London, are both on unconditional bail. The trial will not sit on Wednesday or Thursday and is expected to conclude on Friday.

"By . Chris Pleasance . No Cannes premiere is complete without A-list celebrities, red carpet receptions, and banks of paparazzi. But the eagerly awaited Welcome To New York starring Gerard Depardieu managed to do without all that, attracting attention of its own thanks to its controversial sexual content. Loosely based on the rise and fall of former French presidential hopeful Dominique Strauss-Khan, it was screened in the local Star Cinema, previously known for its pornographic offerings. Scroll down for video . A scene from the film Welcome to New York, which is loosely based on the rise and fall of former French presidential hopeful Dominique Strauss-Khan . Welcome to New York (pictured), a film based on the sex scandal that engulfed Dominique Strauss-Khan in 2011, has premiered at Cannes . In the film Gerard Depardieu (left) plays Mr Deveraux a powerful sex-addict, thought to be based on Strauss-Khan (left) who was accused of sexually assaulting a chambermaid in a New York hotel . Depardieu plays sex-addict Mr Deveraux, a character said to be based on former head of the IMF Mr Khan. The French statesman was arrested in 2011 just as he was preparing a bid to become the next French president, accused by Nafissatou Diallo, a New York chamber maid, of trying to rape her. Lawyers for Mr Strauss-Kahn proved that a sex act which took place was consensual, but he was forced to step down from his $500,000 a-year job at the International Monetary Fund. Diallo then sued Mr Strauss-Kahn, but the two sides reached a financial settlement late last year, the details of which have never been disclosed. In the film, Mr Deveraux is seen taking part in several alcohol-fulled orgies involving prostitutes in a New York hotel room while on a business trip, before raping a hotel chambermaid as she comes to clean the room the next day. Deveraux is then arrested, given a full strip search captured in an unflinching single shot, before another harrowing flashback sequence shows him sexually assaulting a female journalist sent to interview him. In the explicit film, Mr Deveraux is shown raping a chambermaid, also in a New York hotel . The two-hour film, which also stars Nip/Tuck actress Jacqueline Bisset as the character Mr Deveraux’s wife, premiered at the festival on Saturday with a private showing. The film will not be shown in French cinemas but will be released on video-on-demand websites. It will appear in cinemas in other countries however, including the UK, at a later date. Before the screening Depardieu , director Abel Ferrara and Jacqueline Bisset, took to the stage of The Star cinema to introduce the film. Depardieu said he 'disliked politicians' and was 'happy' to participate in the film, while Mr Ferrara said Depardieu had not only agreed to act in the film but also put up 'half the money'. Since the premiere the film has received mixed reviews, with US actor Mickey Rourke saying it was Ferrara's best film in years. Rourke also praised Depardieu as having 'more courage than any other living actor today', according to Yahoo, while French director Claude Lelouch also hailed his performance. However, The Telegraph called the film 'superficial and pretentious', giving it just two stars out of five. Before the screening Vincent Maraval, producer of the film, said the French elite tried to block the  there is an ‘incestuous relationship between the media and political elite’ in France. He told the Independent: ‘No French TV station wanted to finance us. ‘Everyone warned us not to make this film, both our friends and our enemies.’","Welcome To New York, starring Gerard Depardieu, premiered today .

"By . Mail Online Reporter . A South Carolina dog that had its head trapped in an air conditioning duct pipe for up to a week was finally freed yesterday. The male stray dog, named Piper by animal rescuers, was caught by Oconee County animal officials with traps and tranquilizer guns after days of trying to catch the pooch.

Despite being a stray dog, Charles Williams has been friendly with Piper for around a year. The dog will also be neutered while in veterinarian care and receive shots. Upstate . Animal Rescue spokesman Kelly Blair said last week that the dog . couldn't eat or drink with the metal tube clamped tightly around his . head. According to Blair, . the pup refused to let anyone get near to help, so she hoped someone . who is trained to use a tranquilizer gun would come to his aide. Blair said people frequently abandon their pets with no food or water in the area where the dog was found. The black-and-white pooch was discovered last Monday in Oconee County, stuck in the pipe which may have occurred while Piper was chasing a small critter. Being a feral animal, the pooch did not allow anyone to come near him. Running scared: Being a feral animal, the pup ran  away every time someone attempted to go near him for help . Ruff life: The pooch likely was abandoned as a puppy and has been living on the streets for a year, relying on the kindness of neighbors . Neighbor Charles Williams told the station Fox Carolina that volunteer rescuers had come out to try and catch the dog, but he bolted and went into hiding. The dog has been living on the streets . for a year. On Upstate Animal Rescue Foundation's Facebook page, Kelly . Blair wrote that local residents have been feeding the animal. On Friday, animal control officials set up a large trap in hopes of capturing the poor, frightened animal, but it wasn't until Monday that Piper was caught. Upstate Animal Rescue officials said this was a first for the organization, which has been around for 30 years. The group needed donations to help with the pup's medical bills.

"By . Lucy Crossley . Seventeen British men have been arrested in a global raid on people alleged to have used malicious software to take over computers and steal 200,000 usernames and passwords. The worldwide investigation targeted developers and prolific users of Blackshades, a set of 'malware' tools designed to control personal computers. According to the National Crime Agency, the tools are sold online for less than £100 and investigators believe UK users may have extracted around 200,000 usernames and passwords of victims across the world. Scroll down for video . Arrests: Seventeen British men have been arrested in a global raid on people alleged to have used malicious software to take over computers and steal 200,000 usernames and passwords (file photo) Among the malware tools is a remote access tool, or Rat, which enables cyber criminals to remotely take over and control operations of an infected computer. It can be used to access a victim’s webcam, turning it on without their knowledge and taking screen shots, as well as accessing personal files and documents, and to download new content. The Rat can also be used to infect USB devices, aiding the further spread of malware, and infect other computers via peer-to-peer communications. In the dark: Victims are typically infected by clicking on external links on social networking and communication platforms. Often they will be unaware their computer has been affected . Blackshades tools can also capture usernames and passwords, allowing criminals to view stolen data in a similar way to an email inbox. Computers are typically infected when a user clicks on external links on social networking and communication platforms and instead of viewing a picture or video they unwittingly install the malware. In many cases, those affected will have no indication they are infected. Blackshades, and other similar software, enables cyber criminals to remotely access and seize control of a user's computer - stealing passwords and personal information as well as turning on webcams. Once accessed, the information may be used to blackmail victims, and the software also allows users to encrypt computer data which can only be released when a ransom is paid. The software - which can be purchased for less than £100 - is not illegal, but in many countries, including the UK, it is against the law to install it on another person's computer without their knowledge. Typically computers are infected when users click on links on social networks or in emails which claim to lead to pictures or videos - according to the National Crime Agency. According to the FBI, Blackshades has been purchased by thousands of people since it was created in 2010. The 17 British men were amount 97 people in 16 countries arrested on suspicion of developing, distributing or using Blackshades. They were arrested in Derbyshire, Birmingham, Halesowen, Wolverhampton and Newcastle-under-Lyme, Brixham in Devon, Andover in Hampshire, Ashford in Kent, Liverpool, Manchester, Warrington, Essex, St Andrews, Glasgow, Leeds, Humberside and London, the NCA said. The cyber crime operation was carried out jointly with the FBI, and in Europe with Eurojust and Europol. 'Criminals throughout the UK and across the world are finding out that committing crimes remotely offers no protection from arrest,' said Andy Archibald, deputy director of the NCA’s National Cyber Crime Unit. 'The unique scale of this cyber operation shows what can happen when law enforcement agencies at local, national and international level work together to tackle the perpetrators and help keep people safe. 'Cyber crime is one of the most significant criminal threats to the UK. The NCA is helping to build the capacity of its partners across the country and co-ordinating the UK’s collective efforts as part of the response. 'The commitment of our police partners in the cyber arena has been clearly demonstrated by the work culminating in this week’s dramatic activity.' Deputy Chief Constable Peter Goodman, the national policing lead on e-crime, added the operation 'demonstrates the determination of the National Crime Agency, its partners overseas and the UK’s newly-established regional cyber crime units to identify, trace and disrupt those whose potential criminal activity presents a threat to the public’s lawful use of the intranet.'","Men arrested as part of probe into developers and users of Blackshades .

"By . Mark Duell . Jailed for 14 years: Floyd Evans, 19, went on a drink and cocaine binge before arming himself with a knife . A homophobic teenager who left a gay man fighting for life after he stabbed him in the heart during a drug-fuelled ‘hunt’ for homosexuals was jailed for 14 years today. Floyd Evans, 19, went on a drink and cocaine binge before arming himself with a knife and wandering over to a well-known meeting point for gay people on the Roman city walls in Chester. He then used a trick to ambush 35-year-old Brazilian cleaner Francisco Nascimento while the victim was talking to another man - and plunged the knife into his chest. The blade pierced Mr Nascimento’s heart and cut an artery. A policeman who arrived to help applied pressure to his wound before paramedics took him to a specialist trauma unit. The victim was given life-saving surgery at the Royal Liverpool Hospital and was kept in for 11 days - four in intensive care. He has recovered physically but was left ‘mentally distraught’. Evans - whose brother is gay - had deliberately gone to the crime scene to attack a homosexual for kicks, Chester Crown Court was told. The teenager was arrested as he was about to take up a job at a council highways department. He was charged with attempted murder but convicted of the lesser charge of wounding with intent. Scene: Evans went to a well-known meeting point for gay people on Chester's Roman city walls (file picture) Giving him an increased sentence due to the stabbing being a ‘hate crime’, Judge Elgan Edwards said: ‘It is a terrible thing to see a man of just 19 - only 18 when you committed this crime - standing in the dock. But your behaviour that night was quite disgraceful. ‘You armed yourself with a knife, wandered round the streets of Chester and found your way deliberately to the walls at a place you knew well was a meeting point for homosexuals. ‘I’m quite satisfied this was [a] pre-meditated, homophobic attack - you did not have that knife on you for any other reason. All this man was doing was talking to his friend, but he ended up nearly dead.' Earlier, the court had heard how Evans had a history of causing trouble and in the months before the attack made a 999 call in which he threatened to stab police officers and set them on fire. Famous area: The victim encountered a friend on the city walls in Chester (file picture), whom he chatted to for 40 minutes, but both noticed Evans approaching wearing a hat and a hoodie . He later claimed he only did it . because he had a row with his brother about living arrangements and . wanted to get himself arrested to have a free bed in police cells. Sentencing: Judge Elgan Edwards said Evans had committed a 'pre-meditated, homophobic attack' On . the night of the stabbing on October 21 last year, Evans was drunk on . lager and spirits and had been snorting cocaine in the toilets of a pub . in the city. Mr Nascimento, who has lived in the UK since 2005, had been shopping at a Tesco store in Chester but had decided to walk along the city walls, in the hope of finding ‘someone to talk to’. He encountered a friend on the city walls . named Gareth Davies, whom he chatted to for 40 minutes, but both . noticed Evans approaching wearing a hat and a hoodie. The teenager appeared to give a signal used by gay men but then attacked Mr Nascimento without warning. Police were alerted and an officer - who later won a commendation - gave emergency first aid whilst waiting for paramedics. Evans calmly walked away after the attack but was arrested three weeks later after a policewoman identified him from CCTV footage taken on the night of the assault. He denied carrying out the attack, saying: ‘I have no anti-gay views. Everyone is equal. My brother is gay and I’m perfectly happy with that.’ Violence: Evans 'went to the city walls that night because he thought his victim was gay, the local CPS said . From above: Chester's city walls were first built by the Romans and later extended in the Middle Ages . He claimed cocaine made him ‘stupid not aggressive’, and said he could not remember carrying out any attack. Walkaround: A map of Chester's Roman city walls . In a statement Mr Nascimento said he was suffering anxiety, paranoia and insomnia and is awaiting counselling. He is also reluctant to go swimming - something he did regularly before the attack - because of the scarring on his chest. After the case, he said: ‘I hope that . Floyd Evans realises that he could have been facing a murder charge had . it not been for the lifesaving skills of the police, paramedics and . surgeons. ‘I thank God and the amazing people . who saved my life. I will never forget the incident and will always have . the scars, but I am also very grateful to still be alive.’ Cheshire . Constabulary Detective Inspector Helen Spooner, who led the . investigation, said: ‘The victim almost died as a result of the actions . of Floyd Evans. This was an unprovoked and violent attack on a man not . known to him, which left him fighting for his life. ‘Physically . the victim has recovered from this ordeal but mentally he is destroyed. He will have to live with what happened to him for the rest of his . life. The experience has been traumatic.’ Chief . Superintendent Phil Jones, who is in charge of policing in Chester city . centre, said: ‘Violent crime of any kind is not acceptable and this . particular case was treated as a hate crime. ‘We . hope that verdict reassures both the victim and those in the local . community that hate crime is treated extremely seriously and will not be . tolerated.’ 'I will never forget the incident and will always have the scars, but I am also very grateful to still be alive' Francisco Nascimento, victim . Richard Riley, Senior Crown Prosecutor with Mersey-Cheshire Crown Prosecution Service, said: ‘We have always believed that Floyd Evans stabbed My Nascimento because he thought he was gay and that Evans went to that part of the city walls that night for that very reason. ‘Evans is clearly a violent man, quite possibly harbouring sinister feelings towards certain sections of our community. This was what we describe as a hate crime and the Crown Prosecution Service is determined to bring those responsible to justice. ‘Mr Nascimento had done nothing wrong on the night he was attacked. Evans now has several years in prison ahead of him to reflect on the violence and recklessness of his actions on that night.’","Floyd Evans went to well-known meeting point for gay people in Chester .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Two men have been convicted of trafficking and raping eight teenage girls after they groomed them online, took them to hotels and plied they with alcohol. Yasir Ali, 28, and  Daaim Ashraf, 19, are now facing jail after they were found guilty of a total of 24 charges at Cambridge Crown Court today. During the eight week trial the court heard how the pair, who are both from Peterborough abused the vulnerable girls, who were aged between 13 and 16 at the time of the allegations, between 2008 and 2013. Guilty: Daaim Ashraf, 19, (left) and Yasir Ali, 28, (right) were convicted of exploiting vulnerable teenage girls for sex at Cambridge Crown Court today . Jury members were told that Ali and Ashraf had abused the girls who they had groomed after . meeting them through social media. Six of the victims were abused at a . hotel in Peterborough in January and February last year. One of the . girls was also raped in an alleyway in Stamford. A further two victims were identified . during the investigation and disclosed to having been raped in cars at . Ferry Meadows in 2008 and 2010. The girls were traced after being . identified as being at risk of being exploited through an information . trawl by police and Peterborough City Council in January last year. Ali was convicted of four rapes, seven . charges of trafficking for sexual exploitation, two charges of making . indecent images of children and engaging in sexual activity in the . presence of a child and intimidation. Probe: The girls were traced after being identified as being at risk of being exploited through an information trawl by police and Peterborough City Council . Ashraf was convicted of five counts of . trafficking for sexual exploitation, sexual assault, sexual activity . with a child and engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child . and intimidation. Ali was cleared of a further count of . rape from 2008 while a third defendant, James Daly, 25, of Grange Road, . Peterborough, was cleared of a single charge of rape. Charges against two other men were dropped earlier in the trial. The jury of seven women and five men had deliberated for 14 hours and 37 minutes before delivering their unanimous verdicts. Detective Superintendent Gary Ridgway said: 'Today’s convictions are part of the ongoing joint inquiry by Cambridgeshire Constabulary and Peterborough City Council’s Children’s social care to safeguard young people and bring offenders to justice. Decision: The jury of seven women and five men had deliberated for 14 hours and 37 minutes before delivering their unanimous verdicts at Cambridge Crown Court . 'The girls were targeted due to their vulnerability and groomed via social media. They were made to feel special. 'These men preyed on their innocence and took them to hotels where they were plied with alcohol then sexually abused. 'They have each been through horrific ordeals and have shown great bravery in giving evidence against their abusers at court. 'It will no doubt take many years for them to rebuild their lives, but hopefully the knowledge that these men have been brought to justice will be an important step forward for them. 'Our priority has always been, and remains, to protect young people. We will continue to work with the city council and other partner agencies to keep young people safe from harm.' Ali and Ashraf are due to be sentenced next month.","Yasir Ali, 28, and Daaim Ashraf, 19, found guilty of a total of 24 charges .

"A family has begged for the speed limit to be cut outside their house after ten serious crashes in 18 months. The Pinnocks from Wickford, Essex, say it is only a matter of time before somebody is killed after another head-on crash last week left two people in hospital. They have taken pictures of almost all the accidents, including one which left a car on its roof, another smashed into a tree and one vehicle that destroyed their fence and ended up in their garden. Dangerous: An Essex family says that somebody will soon be killed after ten crashes in 18 months outside their home, including several who smashed through their fence and into their garden . Black spot: These two cars were totalled on February 7 2014 at 6am   - which has led to calls for a cut in the speed limit from 60mph . Latest incident: Police inspect a vehicle after a crash that led to two men being taken to hospital last Tuesday . Alison Pinnock, 47, said: 'There have been 10 accidents on this stretch of road, in the past 18 months. 'A number of them have ended up with cars crashing in to our garden. 'We have written to the council a number of times about the problems here. 'We want to see the speed limit reduced from 60mph to 40mph or 30mph. People are just driving along here too quick. Dramatic: This vehicle was left on its roof following an accident ion December 1 last year. The family living next to the crash site say it will inevitably cost lives sooner rather than later . Another fence destroyed: This lorry piles into the Pinnocks' garden near Basildon in Essex on February 13 . In bad shape: This transit van was destroyed in yet another crash on December 30 last year, and the local council has now confirmed plans to improve the road . Another casualty: This smashed estate vehicle is towed away and just last week two people were treated in hospital after another crash on December 1 last year . 'We are frightened it is just a matter of time before someone is killed.' Councillors say highways engineers will be looking at changing the layout of the road as part of the redevelopment of the nearby Runwell Hospital site. Decimated: Vehicles have regularly lost control and smashed into the family's fence. This picture was taken after a crash in February last year . Last week two people were taken to hospital, one with serious injuries, following a head-on smash on the same stretch of road. Malcolm Buckley, Basildon Council member for regeneration said: 'There has been a proposal to for the entry to the site to be moved down the hill, from the Toby Carvery. 'We are also considering weight restrictions on Runwell Road to discourage people from using it as a cut through between the Rettendon Turnpike and Wickford. 'Changes to the speed limit would be part of the considerations by highways engineers.' Councillor Ray Ride, who represents Runwell, said he was aware of the problems in Runwell Road and was working with councillors at Basildon and County Hall. He said: 'It is a dangerous spot with a record of accidents all affecting the Pinnock's home. 'Within the redevelopment of the Runwell Hospital site, which is imminent, road improvements will go in. 'Those might well assist my view that there should be further protection for the Pinnock family and their neighbours. 'We are looking at what options are available.' The Pinnocks family are urging the council to reduce the speed limit after the following 10 crashes occurred outside their property within an 18-month period. 30 Nov 2012  -  5.30am, car overturns onto roof and driver is taken to hospital for treatment1 Dec 2012 -  1.30am, silver Ford hatchback crashes and leaves man trapped inside 1 Dec 2012  - 4.30am, blue hatchback crashes and knocks out electricity in the area 30 Dec 2012 -  9.20pm, white Ford Transit crashes15 Jan 2013 -  Car spins around in road and crashes into next-door neighbour's tree3 Feb 2013 - 3.20am, crash outside property, no further details7 Feb 2013 - 6am, Ford Ka and another vehicle crash.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The granddaughter of the late Labour firebrand Tony Benn is on course to become the first generation of her family to be elected to public office. Emily Benn, 24, is expected to become a Labour councillor this week, continuing a political dynasty dating back more than 100 years. She hopes that winning in the London Borough of Croydon will build on the legacy of her uncle, grandfather, great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather who have all been MPs.

Local elections are being held across the country on Thursday, the same day as elections to the European Parliament.

Her . uncle, Hilary Benn, was Environment Secretary in the last Labour . government and sits in Ed Miliband’s shadow cabinet with the local . government brief. Grandfather . Tony Benn, who died in March, was first elected as an MP in 1950 and . stood down in 2001, serving in Harold Wilson’s Cabinet and stood . unsuccessfully to become Labour’s deputy leader in 1981. Miss . Benn told the Mirror: ‘I find it very strange he's not here and it's a . huge regret that he did not live a few months longer. He would have loved to see me elected…If I'm elected.’ Emily Benn, aged 24, hopes to follow uncle Hilary (left) and late grandfather Tony in being elected to public office this week .

Great-grandfather William Wedgwood Benn was elected as a Liberal MP in 1906, serving in the Asquith government, before he quit in 1927 to join the Labour party, later sitting in the Cabinet of Ramsay Macdonald. Her great-great-grandfather, Sir John Williams Benn, was a Liberal MP from 1892-95 and again from 1904-10. Another great-great-grandfather, Daniel Homes, was a Labour MP from 1911-18. Miss Benn herself stood for Parliament in 2010, in the safe Tory seat of East Worthing and Shoreham. ‘Sadly I could not persuade the electorate of East Worthing and Shoreham to break their habit of a lifetime,’ she added. Far from being a hard-left firebrand, she works in a City bank and describes herself as being New Labour. She added: ‘Parties have to talk about the issues that are central to people's lives, about things like the challenge of finding of a job. ‘All I have to do is talk about how much it costs to live in London, and suddenly you get a wave of stuff and they are interested in politics. I want to buy a house one day and that's not going to happen. ‘There's no point saying this is the Labour Party and this is what we think. We must ask people what they think and take up their issues. Politics isn't about me. It's about their lives. I want to change people's lives for the better.’ If, as many expect, she does make it to Parliament, she will join a long list of MPs with politics in their blood. One in 12 MPs is related to another politician in dynasties dating back 140 years. It includes six married couples who sit alongside each other on the famous green leather benches, 21 MPs whose parents served in the Commons and three pairs of siblings. Among them are David Cameron's great-grandfather Sir William Mount, a Tory MP from 1900-06 and again from 1910-22, Ed Miliband's broth David who quit the Commons after losing out on the Labour leadership and married couples Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper, Duncan Hames and Jo Swinson, and Harriet Harman and Jack Dromey.","24-year-old standing to be a councillor in London Borough of Croydon .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . The dream of building a Grand Designs family home is fading for thousands of Brits - despite Government claims to have sparked a 'self build revolution'. Ministers appointed TV star Kevin McCloud to oversea the revolution, with Tory chairman Grant Shapps boasting that self builds would double under the Coalition. But the prospect of families building their own dream home has collapsed since the last election, official figures reveal. Grand Designs presenter Kevin McCloud was supposed to oversea a revolution in self builds in Britain, but instead the number of families building their own home has slumped dramatically . The number of self-build houses built has fallen by 22% since David Cameron became Prime Minister. In 2010 10,588 homes were self built, according to Treasury calculations. By last year this had slumped to just 8,235, according to the figures released in a Parliamentary Answer to Labour's shadow communities secretary Hilary Benn. Self build homes, like this one in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, were a popular choice for families when the Coalition came to power . Shadow communities secretary Hilary Benn said the Government's pledge to kick start a revolution in self builds was in tatters . Mr Benn told MailOnline: 'Despite the popularity of shows like Grand Designs, and the unending flow of optimistic press releases from DCLG about a purported ""self-build revolution"" the truth is laid bare in these damning HMRC statistics. 'The number of people claiming VAT relief on their self-build homes, DCLG’s own proxy measure for the number of homes completed, far from doubling has actually fallen by a fifth. 'At a time where young people and families are crowded into insecure and expensive rental properties, this Government is doing too little to help them realise their dreams of home ownership, and isn’t doing enough to support self-builders. 'One Nation Labour is committed to building the homes we need and Ed Miliband has made it clear he expects us to reach our goal of getting 200,000 homes built a year by the end of the next Parliament, and we want self-build to make an important contribution.' But Housing Minister Kris Hopkins . defended the Coalition's record. He said: 'When in Government, Labour . did absolutely nothing to support self-build and presided over a massive . housing crash and reduction in mortgage lending which hit all housing . sectors, including self-build. 'This . Government’s long-term economic plan has turned the housing market . around, and we are the first Government ever to actively promote . self-build as an option to those on all incomes.' The self-build 'revolution' was launched in 2011 by then housing minister, now Chairman of the Conservative Party, Grant Shapps. He claimed that government policies would see the size of the self-build market double. In May 2012 Grand Designs presenter Kevin McCloud was appointed as the Government self-build tsar, leading a delegation of industry figures and reporters to the Netherlands to learn from their success. And then in October last year, the Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: 'We’re taking practical steps which will unlock the potential and will turn our country, which is famously a nation of shopkeepers, into a nation of self-builders too.'","Tories pledged to double number of self build homes to tackle housing crisis .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Northern criminals are up to three times more likely to return to a life of crime than southern offenders, official figures revealed this morning. In the north east, up to one in six criminals reoffend within three months of being convicted. But in the south east and Midlands, just one in 18 convicted criminals return to crime. The Government today admitted reoffending was too high and needed to be tackled 'urgently'. But a Labour source said the number of hardened criminals blighting people's lives in struggling northern towns pointed to deeper problems. Almost all of the worst areas for reoffending are in the north east of England. The local authorities with the best records for turning criminals' lives around are all in the Midlands and the south east . The failure to rehabilitate tens of thousands of serial criminals is costing the country £10 billion a year . Percentage of criminals reoffending within three months: . Hartlepool 17.12% . Middlesbrough 16.79% . Newcastle-upon-Tyne 16.46% . Sunderland 14.91% . Darlington 14.88% . Carmarthenshire 14.26% . Stockton-on-Tees 13.26% . Newport 13.16% . Hammersmith and Fulham 12.87% . North Tyneside 12.71% . Redcar and Cleveland 12.59% . Gateshead 12.54% . Durham 12.53% . Wrexham 12.50% . Swindon 12.23% . Northumberland 12.12% . South Tyneside 11.97% . Cardiff 11.69% . City of Kingston upon Hull 11.63% . York 11.59% . Britain's north-south divide in reoffending was revealed in figures published by the Ministry of Justice this morning. Town Halls were ranked by their ability to stop hardened criminals reoffending after being convicted. Of the worst 20 local councils, 14 were in the north of England. Hartlepool in the north east was the worst performing authority in the country, where 17.12 per cent of criminals reoffend within 12 weeks of being convicted of their original offence. Middlesbrough, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Sunderland and Darlington make up the bottom five in the reoffending league. The only area of southern England to come close to the reoffending rates found in the north east is Swindon, in Wiltshire. Wales is also struggling to turn around criminals' lives, with Carmarthenshire, Newport, Wrexham and Cardiff in the 20 worst performing councils. The reoffending crisis in the north is in stark contrast to the situation in the Midlands and south of England. Just one local authority north of Birmingham - Staffordshire - makes it into the top 20 for stopping criminals reoffending. In the City of London, the best performing area in the country, 19 out of 20 criminals do not reoffend within their first three months are on probation. Sandwell, Dudley and Buckinghamshire have similar success stories - with all three managing to drive down reoffending rates to below seven per cent. All the other 20 best performing councils are found in the Midlands and the south east of England. This morning, the Justice Minister Jeremy Wright admitted that 'reoffending has been too high for too long'. He said: 'Last year more than 500,000 offences were committed by those who had broken the law before - despite spending of £4 billion a year on prisons and probation. We need reform, and we need it urgently. 'Our new approach will ensure that for the first time all prison leavers spend at least 12 months working towards their rehabilitation in the community. 'Local adult reoffending statistics do not show a true measure of reoffending - they only record a three-month period whereas the national measure covers a 12-month period.' But Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: 'This data is very revealing and shows what a postcode lottery there is with crime. 'This confirms that depending where you live criminals are more likely to go on and commit more crimes. That's worrying and the Government need to urgently address this so all communities are safe.'

"By . John Hall . A construction worker was killed by a 'piece of flying machinery' just weeks after dodging death in a similar incident, it has been revealed. Ben Wylie, 24, from Westbury in Wiltshire, was killed after being struck in the head by an object while laying foundations for a new office block in Maidenhead, Berkshire last Tuesday. Just six weeks earlier Mr Wylie had posed for photographs with the mangled wreckage of crane that was crushed by a digger only minutes before he planned to move into the area. Escape: Just six weeks before the fatal accident, Mr Wylie posed for photographs with the mangled wreckage of crane that was crushed by a digger only minutes before he planned to move into the area . Mr Wylie was killed after being struck in the head by a piece of flying machinery that had broken off, according to witnesses. Despite emergency services being called to the scene and an air ambulance landing nearby, he was declared dead at the scene. Forensic examiners later attended the site, where Mr Wylie’s body was seen lying next to a 30 foot tall piling drill . with blood covering his head. One builder working at the site, who asked not to be . identified, said: 'A piece of machinery has flown off and hit him. Police are investigating it.' Following the fatal accident, Mr Wylie’s girlfriend, Chrissie Harland, said that she had been left devastated by the tragedy. 'The . guy in this picture is the love of my life and always will be, he . wasn’t only my boyfriend he was my bestfriend, my soul mate! People say . we made such a beautiful couple and I agree, the moment I seen him he . caught my eye,' she told friends. Tragic: Following the fatal accident, Mr Wylie’s girlfriend, Chrissie Harland (left), said she was devastated. Her 24-year-old boyfriend (left and right) was killed by 'a piece of flying machinery' last Tuesday . An inquest was today opened into Mr Wylie’s death. A . date had not yet been set for the full hearing of the inquest where a . coroner would hear the full facts behind what had occurred. Just six . weeks before the fatal accident, Mr Wylie told friends he had cheated . death when he dodged a potentially lethal accident by two minutes. He had been working on a building site when a digger driver reversed into a small crane, crushing its platform. Mr Wylie told friends he would have been between the two vehicles and crushed if the collision had happened two minutes later. Posing for photographs with the twisted metal, Mr Wylie said: 'So, I may be smiling here but if it would have happens to minutes later then I probably wouldn’t of been smiling [sic]'. A spokesman for the building firm, McAleer and Rushed said: 'We are all in shock at the moment. We will be releasing a statement in due course.' A spokesman for the Health and Safety Executive said: 'HSE has been informed and is making initial enquiries. An inspector will be on site later this afternoon. We will be working alongside Thames Valley Police, who have primacy.' The inquest continues.

"By . Mark Duell . Thief: Jayne Rand, 49, stole luxury leather handbags over her shoulder from department stores . A mother of two was today ordered to pay back more than £117,000 she made on eBay after stealing 905 designer handbags in three years. Jayne Rand, 49, of Purton, Wiltshire, would sling the luxury leather items over her shoulder in department stores - pretending they were her own handbag - to fund her lavish lifestyle. Police believe the housewife is Britain’s biggest designer-label handbag thief - stealing almost one a day from 2009 to 2012 around the UK. She targeted brands such as Gucci, Radley and Ted Baker, to sell them on eBay. Rand started stealing after the property business she ran with her husband got into financial difficulty. Her home-run business made her £117,171 by selling them to eBay customers all over Britain. But she may now have to sell her home to pay back the proceeds of her handbag crimes. Prosecutor David Wooler told an earlier hearing: ‘She targeted department stores including Debenhams, House of Fraser and John Lewis. ‘Her usual method of theft was to go into the store without a bag, pick up one from the display, walk around with it on her shoulder for a while, then simply walk out of the store. Sometimes she would have to remove the security tag, but usually she wouldn’t have to.’ She was told by Judge Tom Crowther QC at Cardiff Crown Court today that she must repay everything in the next six months that she made by selling them, or face two years in jail. Andrew Taylor, defending, had told the court Rand would need six months to organise her property portfolio to pay back the money. Stolen goods: Rand targeted brand names such as Gucci, Radley and Ted Baker - to sell them on eBay . Luxury: Her criminal business made her £117,171 by selling the handbags to eBay customers across Britain . He said: ‘Although the property market may be in the early stages of recovery it isn’t always easy to sell. Given six months they will be able to organise their portfolio of properties to be able to sell.’ Rand’s one-woman crimewave was brought to an end by two eagle-eyed security workers at a House of Fraser outlet in Cwmbran, South Wales. Couple: Rand is pictured with her husband Philip, 50 . She admitted the theft and then confessed to police to stealing 905 handbags since 2009. The bags were worth between £175 and £200 each. Rand admitted stealing 905 handbags and four purses from House of Fraser and various retail outlets between December 2009 and December 2012. She also admitted converting criminal assets from 838 handbags. Rand was jailed for 18 months last year at Newport Crown Court after admitting stealing the handbags to order and selling them online. She was released after six months on a home detention curfew. Rand’s 50-year-old planning consultant husband Philip, and her grown-up daughters Gemma, 19, and Amber, 23, had no idea she was shoplifting. Mr Taylor told the court: ‘She became almost immune to the feeling of wrongdoing. She was almost addicted to stealing high-value bags in an attempt to keep the ship afloat. 'She never expected to find herself in such dire circumstances and out of desperation took this course of action.’ Rand walked free from the proceeds of crime hearing today with her husband. A Ministry of Justice spokesman told MailOnline today: ‘We do not comment on individuals. ‘Home detention curfew provides a crucial opportunity for low risk offenders . to be resettled back into the community while subject to a strict set of . licence conditions. If an offender breaches their licence conditions . they can be recalled to prison.’","Jayne Rand stole luxury leather handbags over her shoulder from stores .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . It was supposed to be a moment of triumph and skill - arms thrown wide in jubilation after an arduous climb. But one cyclist's attempt to show off for the cameras took a turn for the worse as he lost his balance and plunged ingloriously into a grass verge. Matt Adams, a 36-year-old IT manager was just about to crest Box Hill in Surrey - part of the 2102 Olympic road cycling route - when he spotted a photographer and spread his arms wide with a grin. Look mum, no hands! Matt Adams, 36, was climbing Box Hill in Surrey when he made his triumphant - and doomed - gesture . Pride before a fall: Mr Adams manages to hold the pose for a brief second - but disaster is looming... Turn for the worse: The IT manager's triumph turns sour as he swerves towards the verge . Downfall: With no hope of recovery, Mr Adams begins to fly over the handlebars, arms outstretched . But the exuberant gesture was to be his downfall, as just seconds after striking the pose, his wheels wobbled and he lost control of the bicycle. The sportsman, of Basingstoke, Hampshire, stretched out his hands and went tumbling sideways towards the grassy verge. With one arm he tried to wrestle the handlebars back, but had already lost his grip and could only prepare for the worst. Mr Adams - who was uninjured by . his misadventure - was cycling in the London Revolution Sportive bicycle . race. The 185-mile event was well into its second day by the time Mr . Adams and his fellow cyclists reached the famous Box Hill incline. Before . his moment of pride and folly, he would have cycled through Windsor . Park, and past Ascot racecourse. The route also cut through central . London, where the racers passed over Tower Bridge. Flying: The cyclist, thankfully wearing a helmet, flings his other arm in front of him as he braces for impact . Bottoms up: Mr Adams's bicycle tipped and his saddle flew high as he made his inelegant descent . Paradise lost: Mr Adams - who wasn't hurt by his fall - turned red-faced towards his fellow riders and passing traffic . Not the descent he had in mind: Mr Adams slips a few places as the competition zooms by . Lycra-clad Mr Adams hardly finds himself alone in his enthusiasm for competitive cycling, fuelled, some say, by the notable successes of British champions including Sir Chris Hoy, Sir Bradley Wiggins, Jessica Pendleton and Chris Froome. England will once again play host to world-class cycling in two months' time, when two stages of the Tour de France will be held in Yorkshire. Riders will pedal 190km from Leeds to Harrogate on Saturday, July 5, then 200km from York to Sheffield on Sunday 6. The following day riders will head from Cambridge to London before continuing in France. In recent years the sport has gone from strength to strength throughout Britain, with 99,000 more people cycling now than in 2008. According to a recent survey by Sport England, over 2million people now cycle at least once a week. Figures compiled by British Cycling show that 25,000 Britons compete regularly in cycling events, with more than 3,500 races taking place every year. In taking on the Box Hill climb, Mr Adams joined a long line of cycling Olympians - though they mostly remain upright during the attempt. British champions Chris Froome and Bradley Wiggins, who both won medals in 2012, took on the ascent during the road race event. However, though they rode to triumph in other races, road cycling was not to be theirs, with Wiggins finishing at number 103 and Froome at 109. Alexander Vinokourov of Kazakhstan came away with the gold medal that day, boasting a time of 5 hours, 45 minutes and 57 seconds. Olympic glory: In this image Christopher Froome, right, is shown leading the pack up Box Hill, with Bradley Wiggins two places behind. They would later slip more than 100 places, though neither fell over .","Matt Adams, 36, was climbing Box Hill in Surrey as part of a 185-mile race when he spread wide his arms .

"By . Mark Duell . A cat hid undiscovered inside the engine of a campervan for four days while the vehicle underwent an MOT test and a service, it has been revealed. Oliver was snuggled under the bonnet of the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 316 vehicle - but was missed by mechanics, who carried out work including an oil change. His owner Clare Waterfield, 49, and her two children Tara, 15, and Jorge, 12, had searched for their beloved tabby after he vanished from their home in Plymouth, Devon. Missed by mechanics: Oliver was snuggled under the bonnet of the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 316 vehicle . In the meantime, the family broke off from the hunt to take her motor home to her local garage for an MOT test and a full service. Staff checked for faults and carried out essential maintenance before handing back the keys to her. But after the car was back home, the family's other cat Benji began sniffing the campervan's bonnet - and they heard a quiet meow when they went to investigate. They opened up the bonnet and were amazed to see Oliver beneath the engine block. It took her 30 minutes to coax the pet out of his hiding place but he eventually emerged completely unscathed. Sports therapist Mrs Waterfield said: ‘We're just relieved to have him back. He's so timid and doesn't normally go out. It took us half an hour to coax him out of the motor home.’ Found: Owner Clare Waterfield had searched for Oliver after he vanished from the family home in Plymouth . Mechanics scoured the campervan for faults before failing its MOT because of an exhaust problem. Nearly two years old: The family took in Oliver as a young kitten from a rescue centre in Devon . But despite changing the oil and cleaning the engine filters, missing tabby Oliver was able to avoid detection as they worked on the vehicle for several hours. The family took in Oliver as a young kitten from a rescue centre close to their gated mews home. Oliver, nearly two years old, managed to creep out when a stone got caught in a security door, leaving it slightly ajar overnight. Mrs Waterfield, her husband Brian, 69, and Tara and Jorge, noticed he had gone on May 11. Mrs Waterfield said: ‘We walked up and down the streets searching for him. I rang the vets, the RPSCA, everyone I could think of. Oliver is a member of the family. He's my daughter's cat so she was particularly upset. The campervan was parked in the street outside. I did have a look underneath but I couldn't see him.’ Semi-retired motor dealer Mr Waterfield was due, meanwhile, to take the campervan to a local garage for a service and MOT test. He broke off from the search on May 12 to deliver the vehicle before picking it up several hours later. A day later Mrs Waterfield and Tara resumed the hunt, this time taking along ten-month-old Benji in the hope he could help find his missing feline pal. Explanation: Oliver's owners think he probably crept out of the engine area while the mechanics worked on the car and hid in a different part of the undercarriage, possibly next to the vehicle's water tank . Mrs Waterfield said: ‘I saw Tara at the gate with Benji in her hands and said, “put him back, I don't want to lose another cat”. But Tara thought Benji could help us in the search so I let her bring him along. Reunited: Mrs Waterfield, 49, said her beloved tabby Oliver was 'a member of the family' ‘A little later Benji started meowing and I realised I could hear a second meow coming from somewhere. I looked up and down the street and at the houses before I realised it was coming from the campervan. I shouted at Brian to get the keys and we looked under the bonnet. ‘All I could see at first was some fir then a head suddenly pooped out. He was right at the front, tucked up beside the radiator, and we had a real job coaxing him out with some food. ‘He smelt a bit oily but he was otherwise fine. We gave him two packets of cat food and a bowl of milk which he finished in one gulp - he hadn't eaten for days.’ Mr and Mrs Waterfield think Oliver probably crept out of the engine area while the mechanics worked on the car and hid in a different part of the undercarriage, possibly next to the vehicle's water tank. Mrs Waterfield added: ‘He's quite timid but he likes the campervan and he's familiar with it. There are several little hidey-holes underneath. He probably went back to the engine afterwards because it's snug and warm.’ Her husband added: ‘The guys at the garage did a thorough job. He probably wasn't in the engine when they opened it up. ‘Ironically, it failed the MOT because of the exhaust pipe and had to go back in. They wouldn't have had any reason to check all the nooks and crannies underneath.’","Tabby called Oliver was snuggled inside Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 316 .

"By . Martin Robinson . A bogus Good Samaritan who comforted a terrified betting shop worker after she was robbed by a man wielding an axe has been jailed for six years because he had planned the attack. Alexander Millar received a £100 'public spirit' reward from Ladbrokes for calling the police and caring for the female manager during the raid at the shop in Ann’s Terrace, Darlington. But detectives later discovered the 21-year-old was 'up to his neck in' the plot with housemate Shane Lowther, 23, who burst in wearing a balaclava and waving a weapon on September 16 last year. Duplicitous: Alexander Millar, 21, left, received a £100 voucher from Ladbrokes for comforting the female manager after a robbery - but it emerged he planned it with his friend Shane Lowther, 23, right . Both men were jailed for the robbery at Teesside Crown Court yesterday with Recorder James Brown telling the pair he held them equally responsible. Adrian Dent, prosecuting, said Millar 'gave the appearance of being a customer - he regularly frequented betting shops. 'All of a sudden Lowther came into the premises wearing a balaclava, wielding an axe and carrying a bag. 'He told the manager to put the money in the bag - she was extremely frightened.' The manager believed Millar was there to place a bet and asked him not to leave her as she filled the bag with cash totalling £475 and gave it to Lowther. As she pressed the panic button, Lowther shouted to Millar to hold the shop door to stop it from locking shut automatically. Mr Dent said Millar stayed with the manager and called the police for her before giving his name and address to officers. He later returned to the shop that night to claim £134 he had won on a gaming machine before the robbery. Scam: Lowther rushed into this bookies in Darlington with his face covered and wielding an axe - but his friend was already waiting and pretended to be a customer afterwards . The court heard how he was later given £100 in vouchers by Ladbrokes for being 'so public spirited'. Lowther was arrested after he confessed to family members and they reported him. Millar claimed he was not involved, but he was convicted after a jury heard the men shared a house in Gladstone Street, Darlington. The court heard how both men have numerous previous convictions. In 2010, Millar was sent to a young offenders’ institution for 18 months for his part in a failed brothel scam. The defendant and a female accomplice planned to rob a punter who had replied to an advert in a national newspaper. But Millar was left bloodied and in tears when the man they tried to trick turned out to be a burly soldier. John Turner, defending Millar, said his client had largely addressed a drugs problem but still had a gambling problem which had left him with large debts. Sentencing: The two men were jailed for a total of ten years at Teesside Crown Court as they were equally responsible, the judge said . Stephen Andrews, defending Lowther, said the defendant had written a letter of apology to the shop manager. Mr Andrews said: 'He knows exactly what he did - the seriousness of the situation is not lost on him.' Millar was sentenced to six years in prison while Lowther, who was given credit for his guilty plea, was jailed for four years. Recorder James Brown told Millar: 'It was particularly disgraceful that you pretended to be a good Samaritan when in reality you were fully involved and up to your neck in the scheme yourself.' Speaking to both men Recorder Brown said: 'You can be under no illusion that this was a very serious offence committed against a vulnerable target.'","Alexander Millar, 21, rewarded for his 'public spirit' after the violent robbery .

"By . Jill Reilly . Smiling widely as he bounces a child on his knee Kim Jong-Un poses during a photo call as it is revealed he is finding it 'difficult' to sleep following the collapse of a 23-storey tower block in North Korea. The release of a series of images from a hospital visit coincidence with the publication of photos showing relatives crying as a North Korean official apologies for the building's collapse in Pyongyang at the weekend - an unusual move from the secretive state. The undated pictures were released by North Korean's official news agency and show the 31-year-old accompanied by his wife Ri Sol-Ju meeting with children at a baby home and orphanage as he visits the Taesongsan General Hospital in Pyongyang. In many of the photos the leader is wearing a white doctor's coat as she grins for the camera. At one point two little boys even pull on his arms as he walks down a corridor in the newly-built hospital. Scroll down for video . Smiling widely as he bounces a child on his knee Kim Jong-Un poses during a photo call as it is revealed he is finding it 'difficult' to sleep following the collapse of a 23-storey tower block in North Korea . Kim Jong-Un, accompanied by his wife Ri Sol-Ju meets with children at a baby home and orphanage as he visits the Taesongsan General Hospital in Pyongyang . In one image a toddler, who is wearing pink, looks entertained by the visit as she clutches on to the dictator, although a nurse and another little girl behind the leader look less enamored with his presence. The timely release of the photos could be an attempt to steer public attention away from the accident - scores, if not . hundreds, of people are feared dead or seriously injured after the building collapsed in what officials . surprisingly conceded was an 'unimaginable accident'. The word of the collapse in the secretive nation's capital was reported Sunday morning by the North's official Korean Central News Agency, which gave no death toll but said that the accident was 'serious' and upset North Korea's leader. The report said it occurred in the . capital's Phyongchon district on Tuesday 'as the construction of an . apartment house was not done properly and officials supervised and . controlled it in an irresponsible manner.' The photos were released today and one of them shows the children trying to get closer to Kim Jong-Un during the visit . A toddler looks entertained by the visit as she clutches on to the dictator who is kitted out in a white coat, although a nurse and another little girl behind the leader look less enamored with his presence . Kim-Jogn-Un previously visited Taesongsan General Hospital when it was being built by the People's Army last year. KCNA says the hospital covers a total plot of more than 100,000 square meters . At certain points the dictator had a white coat draped over his clothing as he met with patients in the wards with his wife standing alongside . During the visit the leader was seen giving instructions to officials who accompanied him during the visit . In Seoul, a South Korean government official speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the information said the apartment building that collapsed was presumed to have housed 92 families. That could mean the casualties could be in the hundreds because a typical North Korean family has four members. However, it was not clear whether all the residents were inside at the time of the collapse, or that four people lived in each apartment. It is not unusual for people to start living in apartments before the construction is complete. The official said he did not have any figure for the actual death toll. According to the KCNA report, the rescue operation ended Saturday and officials apologised to bereaved families and district residents. On the streets of Pyongyang on Sunday, residents expressed outrage over the incident. A construction division officer apologises to residents after the collapse of a tower block in Pyongyang left a large number of people dead . North Korean officials offered a rare public apology for the collapse of the apartment building under construction in Pyongyang, which a South Korean official said was believed to have caused considerable casualties that could mean hundreds might have died . 'This accident happened because they broke the rules and methods of construction,' resident Pak Chol told The Associated Press. 'After this accident, we must make sure that this kind of terrible accident never happens again, by sticking to the proper method of building.' Another resident, Hong Nam Hyok, said that 'everyone in Pyongyang is now sharing the sorrow of the victims and the bereaved families.' The KCNA report cited one official as saying Kim Jong Un 'sat up all night, feeling painful after being told about the accident.' North Korea's highly controlled state media rarely report news that might be considered negative, and an admission of fault by the government is unusual. The word of the collapse in the secretive nation's capital was reported by the North's official Korean Central News Agency, which gave no death toll but said that the accident was 'serious' and upset North Korea's leader . Families of victims of an accident at an apartment construction site in Pyongyang grieve during a gathering in the capital . High rise city: The block of flats was under construction but it is believed that many families had moved in before the block was completed . The country regularly blames South Korea for starting the 1950-53 Korean War, although outside historians say that the North attacked first. North Korea also denies responsibility for an attack on a South Korean warship that killed 46 people in 2010, despite a South Korean-led international investigation that blamed a Pyongyang torpedo. Sometimes, however, the country owns up to failures. Many were surprised when the North admitted in 2012 that a high-profile rocket launch fizzled soon after takeoff - an acknowledgement that followed Pyongyang's claiming of success for other such launches that foreign governments said had been failures. The building collapse came at a time when the South Korean government has received near daily criticism from its citizens as well as regular bashing by North Korean media for its handling of last month's ferry sinking that left more than 300 people dead or missing.","The undated picture was released by .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A Spanish cyclist was saddled with acute embarrassment after he passionately celebrated winning a Tour of California stage – without realizing he had one lap to go. Eloy Teruel screamed and pumped his fists in the air as he crossed what he thought was the finishing line of the prestigious event’s penultimate seventh stage in Pasadena. But his unbridled joy quickly turned to humiliation as it became apparent that Saturday’s race wasn’t over. There was another lap of a 3.1mile (five kilometre) circuit left to pedal around. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Oops: Eloy Teruel mistakenly raises his arms, thinking he had won the seventh stage of the Tour of California in Pasadena on Saturday . However, the Spaniard saw the funny side, and tweeted: ‘I wanted to win, luckily no one has seen. Hahahahaha.’ He joins a long list of sports stars who've celebrated prematurely, which includes Alex Cujavante coasting towards the finishing line during the 2010 Roller Speed Skating Championships in Colombia with his arms raised in victory, only to be overtaken in the final few yards and Lindsey Jacobellis indulging in a victory 'tail-grab' in the 2006 Winter Olympics snowboard cross - only to fall over before the finishing line.

"A HIV+ nurse was sentenced  to three years in jail today for criminal negligence after she pricked herself with a needle before injecting a child. Rosemary Namubiru, 64, was convicted for using a intravenous needle on the child after pricking herself - a decision slammed as 'deeply flawed' by HIV/AIDS campaigners. Throughout her trial, the nurse maintained she was not acting in malice and the incident was an accident. Two tests have shown the child was not infected with HIV, according to court records. Ugandan nurse Rosemary Namubiru sits at the dock at the Buganda Road Magistrates Court today where she was sentenced to three years in jail for criminal negligence . Scores of international activist groups . rallied around the nurse - saying she was the victim of stigma and . discrimination because of her HIV status and should not face trial. Despite their support, she was found guilty of criminal negligence for allegedly in court today and sentenced to three years behind bars. In November last year all direct aid was cut following a corruption scandal in the country. However, it will still receive £97.9million in aid from the UK this year, The Department for International Development said. A DFID spokesperson said: 'We ended direct payments to the Ugandan government last year.' According to the Overseas Development Institute, the country received $1.6bn (£960m) in total from western countries in 2011, making it the world's 20th largest aid recipient. Following the incident in January this year, the nurse was later denied bail in a controversial decision by a magistrate who ruled that she posed a danger to the public. International activists rallied behind the nurse - claiming she was charged and convicted because she had HIV . The nurse was charged under a colonial-era law against negligence that . spreads a deadly disease. However, since she was charged Ugandan lawmakers have passed a law . specifically criminalizing the intentional transmission of HIV as part . of the government's efforts to stem the growing rate of HIV in this East . African country. That measure also has been criticised by groups that . say such a law will be difficult to enforce and may also be used to . violate the rights of people living with HIV. Some organisations said her trial was unwarranted and she should only have faced disciplinary action from the local nurses' association. Asia Russell from the Global Access Project said: 'The . deeply flawed ruling shows that stigma and discrimination against . people with HIV is alive and well in Uganda. 'Because of her HIV . status, Rosemary's trial was plagued from the beginning with bias. Rosemary never had the presumption of innocence the Constitution . guarantees.' Many Ugandans, however, see her case as a shocking example of malice or negligence by a trusted medical worker. Namubiru's arrest was widely covered in the Ugandan press, with some dubbing her the 'killer nurse' - a description that some activists said violated her right to a fair trial. According to the most recent survey by Uganda's Ministry of Health, 7.3 percent of the Ugandan population has HIV - up from about 6 percent a decade ago. At least 60 countries criminalize the transmission of HIV or the failure to disclose one's HIV status to sex partners, according to AIDS-Free World.","Rosemary Namubiru, 64, sentenced to three years in jail in Ugandan court .

The world's most complete mammoth will go on show at London's Natural History Museum at the end of this week. Here, the ancient animal is in her custom case being transported to the museum .

Lyuba is named after Yuri's wife and her name means love in Russian. Her . body was so well preserved because it was buried in wet clay and mud, . which froze, preventing oxygen from decomposing her remains. It's as if she is sleeping: The baby mammoth (pictured) was plucked from the Siberian permafrost where she has hidden for 42,000 years . The remains were found by reindeer Yuri Khudi and his sons, left, while they were gathering firewood.

Real tusks and teeth from the woolly giants will also go on show . Lyuba is one of a number of the animals to have been found close to the north-west Siberian river in recent years. Members of the public will be able to see her pristinely preserved body when it forms the centrepiece of an exhibition called Mammoths: Ice Age Giant, which opens on 23 May.

It has been buried for 40,000 years in a vacuum, which has meant that oxygen has not decomposed the remains . Lyuba the baby mammoth (pictured) measures 33inches (85cm) tall and 51 inches (130cm) long - a little larger than a dog . The little mammoth was discovered near the Yuribei River (marked) in Siberia, Russia in May 2007 . Lyuba has previously been on show at the Shemanovsky Museum in Russia and at exhibitions in Chicago and Hong Kong before that. Professor Adrian Lister, a mammoth researcher at the Natural History Museum, said: 'It's an honour to be showcasing the world's best preserved mammoth for the first time in western Europe. 'Lyuba is hugely important for helping us to understand the lives of ice age animals. This exhibition is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to meet this amazing creature from more than 40,000 years ago.' The discovery by Lyuba Yuri Khudi and his sons, one of whom is pictured with the mammoth, was a complete accident . The discovery in 2007 caused excitement in the scientific community because of Lyuba's completeness. Here, scientists make observations in Siberia where the body was found . Scientists said in March that they have taken a step towards cloning the extinct woolly mammoth and there is a 'high chance' it will happen. Experts expect to extract ‘high quality DNA’ from a 43,000 year old carcass found in Siberia. Woolly mammoths finally died out in eastern Siberia around 4,000 years ago. Radik Khayrullin, vice president of the Russian Association of Medical Anthropologists, said: ‘The data we are about to receive will give us a high chance to clone the mammoth.’ But he called for responsibility in bringing the ancient beast back to life, urging that competing teams seeking to win a race to clone the mammoth, not to play God for the sake of it. ‘We must have a reason to do this, as it is one thing to clone it for scientific purpose and another to clone for the sake of curiosity,’ he said. A cloning attempt would involve a female elephant – the closest living relative of the mammoth - acting as a surrogate mother.","Lyuba was discovered in Siberia in 2007 by a reindeer herder and his sons .

"By . Lydia Warren . Josh Powell starved one of his sons to the point of malnutrition and possibly poisoned his wife with homemade drinks before she vanished, according to a new book. The startling claims have been made by Susan Powell's friends more than four years after the 29-year-old mother-of-two disappeared from her Utah home. While her body has never been found, her husband Josh was long suspected of having a role in her disappearance. Then in February 2012, he attacked his sons, aged five and seven, with a hatchet and blew them - and himself - up in his Washington state home. Speaking to authors Gregg Olsen and Rebecca Morris for their book, 'If I Can't Have You', which is released on Tuesday, the friends have given a terrifying insight into the Powell household. Where is she? Susan Powell, pictured with her sons Braden and Charlie, vanished in 2009 and in the months ahead of her disappearance, her husband might have been poisoning her, friends have said . They claim that Josh Powell, who was unemployed, controlled the family's finances - ordering his broker wife only to buy the cheapest groceries and refusing to feed the children three meals a day. 'Susan had to research what was on sale at what store,' Michele Oreno told the authors. 'Then she had to come home and put it into the computer, what she spent on every item. '[Josh] was really ticked off because the week before she had spent two cents more on a can of peas than he found at another store... It got so he wouldn’t give her money for food or anything.' Susan even called friends to ask if she could sneak hot dogs from them because the boys were so hungry, friends said. Then, when Charlie Powell was a year old, a doctor diagnosed him with malnutrition, the book said. Troubled: Her husband, Josh Powell, pictured, also withheld food from his young sons, friends said . Tragic: He killed himself and his sons in 2012 by striking them with a hatchet and blowing up the house . 'He gets one meal a day at day care. That's all he needs,' Josh told Susan, according to friend Rachel Marini. 'You’re not wasting my food on him because he’s just going to poop it out!' Friends added that they started to suspect him of poisoning his wife in October 2009, two months before she vanished. She began to feel nauseous so wondered if she was pregnant before miscarrying, friends said. 'He made a . lot of organic products for her to drink, a lot of thick yogurt stuff . and fermented drinks with kefir,' friend Amber Hardman explained. The book . suggests that there is also a possibility that Braden, the couple's . youngest son, was molested by Josh's father Steve, who was later charged . with voyeurism for taking pictures of young girls who lived next door . to him. What did he know? Powell, pictured after his wife vanished, reportedly ordered his wife around in their home . Theories: The new insights were shared by friends in a book out Tuesday, left. It also suggests that one of the sons may have been sexually assaulted by Josh's father Steve, pictured in court, right . When the boys were taken from the custody of their father, Braden was diagnosed with a fungal skin . infection; one way to contract this infection is through sexual contact, the authors said. Susan's body was never found, although the search still continues. Josh has claimed that his wife was at home when he took his sons, Charlie and Braden, on a winter camping trip in Utah's West Desert. In February 2012, 36-year-old Josh Powell took his two sons into his home from a state supervisor, attacked them with a hatchet and then blew up the family home, killing all three. Police documents from May 2012 reveal that Utah officials believe that Josh killed his wife and that his brother Michael helped dispose of her body. Michael killed himself in February 2013.","Friends have spoken to the authors of a new book, out on Tuesday .

"Former SAS sniper Danny Nightingale has lost his latest battle against conviction for illegally possessing a 9mm Glock pistol and 300 rounds of ammunition. Last July the special forces soldier was sentenced to two years’ military detention, suspended for 12 months, by a military court in Bulford, Wiltshire, after he was convicted for the second time. Today, three . judges sitting at the Court Martial Appeal Court in London rejected an . application by Sergeant Nightingale, 39, from Crewe, Cheshire for permission to appeal against the conviction. He was found guilty of having a 9mm Glock pistol and more than 300 rounds of ammunition - kept as a trophy from his days in Iraq - in the bedroom of his shared Army house. Former SAS sniper Danny Nightingale has lost his latest battle against conviction for illegally possessing a 9mm Glock pistol and 300 rounds of ammunition . Last July the special forces soldier was sentenced to two years¿ military detention, suspended for 12 months, by a military court in Bulford, Wiltshire, after he was convicted for the second time . The pistol was found in his wardrobe and ammunition was under his bed in a plastic . box in September, 2011. He was originally ordered to serve 18 months in military detention after pleading guilty in November 2012. He was then released after the Court of Appeal cut and suspended his sentence to 12-months. He was found guilty of having a 9mm Glock pistol and more than 300 rounds of ammunition in the bedroom of his shared Army house. The pistol was found in his wardrobe and ammunition was under his bed in a plastic box in September, 2011 . His conviction was then entirely overturned on appeal in March 2013, on the basis that he had been placed under ‘improper pressure’ to plead guilty - and in May, a judge ordered a retrial. In July, the special forces soldier was sentenced to two years’ military detention, suspended for 12 months, by a military court in Bulford, Wiltshire. During . a military career starting in 1995 he served in the former Yugoslavia, . Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. He received a medical discharge, . remaining in the Army until it commenced in February this year. Police found the arsenal at the home he shared with an SAS comrade – identified only as Soldier N – after a tip-off. Sgt Nightingale, a veteran of 18 years, told detectives he was given the Glock as a war trophy by Iraqi troops he trained in the warzone in 2007. He said the ammunition was left over from his job as a range instructor. But at his six-day trial last year the soldier changed his story, insisting he had made a ‘false confession’. The married father-of-two blamed his confusion on memory loss caused by a brain injury suffered when he collapsed during a charity run in the Brazilian jungle in 2009. He said he had no recollection of receiving the weapon and explained he filled in gaps in his memory with stories other people had told him – a medical condition known as ‘confabulation’. He argued that Soldier N, serving two years in prison after admitting possessing another Glock, brought both pistols back from Iraq and planted one in his bedroom to avoid a tougher sentence. But the board rejected his story and found him guilty, concluding he had put the public at risk by storing the cache in his rented house in Hereford. Rejecting Nightingale's renewed application for permission to appeal, Lord Thomas, sitting with Mr Justice Hickinbottom and Mr Justice Jeremy Baker, said there was a 'considerable amount' of evidence before the court martial which 'supported' the conviction. Lord Thomas said the appeal court could not see 'in any way' how his proposed grounds of appeal - the principal one relating to expert evidence - would 'affect the conviction'. Dismissing his application for permission to appeal today, Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas ruled that there was nothing in the grounds he wished to argue which affected the safety of his conviction. 1995: Nightingale joins the 1st Battalion, the Queen's Lancashire Regiment . 2001: The soldier transfers to the SAS . 2007: Completes a tour of duty in Iraq -  where he claimed he was given the pistol  by Iraqi troops he trained in the warzone .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Ed Miliband’s leadership has reached a ‘crunch point’, senior Labour figures have warned after slipped behind the Tories in several polls. The Labour leader will have dinner with his new US election guru David Axelrod in a bid to get his campaign back on track, as economic optimism surged to record levels. It comes as Ed Balls issued a warning that Labour will not win as an ‘anti-business party’ and frontbenchers urged the leadership to address issues which concern ordinary people. Labour leader Ed Miliband has reached a 'crunch point', colleagues say as Ed Balls (left) warns the party cannot win by being anti-business . Unease in Labour ranks has been heightened by the evaporation of the party’s lead in the polls. There are also concerns that the popularity of individual policies is not matched by enthusiasm for the idea of Mr Miliband becoming Prime Minister. One shadow cabinet minister said: ‘A month ago we were more confident. Now we are at a crunch point. ‘Over the next few months we need to start setting out the results of the policy review and decide what we are focussing on.’ Another frontbencher added: ‘When I see Ed on TV I think “who is that?” It’s not the Ed I know in private. ‘Voters don’t see someone who is authentic. I don’t know how you address that, but it needs to be addressed soon.’ Attacks on energy firms, banks and landlords have also raised fears that the party is anti-business. In an apparent swipe at the leader’s strident attacks, shadow chancellor Ed Balls told the FT: ‘I don’t think Labour will win the next election as an anti-business party.’ Yesterday former Labour trade minister Lord Digby Jones warned: ‘The Labour leadership is one of the least business-friendly leaders of political parties I’ve seen for years.’ 53 per cent of people think the UK economy will improve over the next year, according to Ipsos MORI while just 18 per cent think it will get worse . Polls at the weekend showed two-thirds of people backed Labour's policies on freezing energy bills, state-run railways and increasing rent controls, but only 23 per cent think Mr Miliband is up to the job of being Prime Minister. Mr Axelrod, Barack Obama's election guru, is meeting Labour's top brass for two days of intensive discussions, including dinner with leader Mr Miliband tonight. Mr Axelrod was hired last month on a reported six-figure salary to provide advice as the party goes into what is expected to be a fiercely fought campaign for the May 2015 general election. Labour has said he will be an integral part of their team, working closely with campaign co-ordinator Douglas Alexander and the party's senior pollster Stan Greenberg. He is expected to take part in regular strategic discussions with Mr Miliband. However there are growing tensions at the top of the party about which issues it should focus on at the election. Conflicting camps are pushing for social care, child care, energy bills, the NHS, the cost of living, reversing the bedroom tax and taxing the rich to be put centre stage. Party strategists have struggled with how to respond to the dramatic pace of the economic recovery. David Cameron today celebrated a record surge in employment figures to 30.4million as the Bank of England upgraded its growth forecasts, predicting 3.4% growth this year and 2.9 per cent next year, up from 2.7 per cent. Fewer than a quarter of voters think Mr Miliband is up to the job of being Prime Minister . Polls suggest voters support Labour policies, but are unconvinced that they will be delivered . Labour’s Rachel Reeves said the jobs figures were ‘welcome’ but referred to the ‘so-called recovery’. It comes as Ipsos MORI said economic optimism is at its highest ever point in its 36-year history. Overall 53 per cent of people think the UK economy will improve over the next year. Just 18 per cent think it will get worse, while 25 per cent think it will stay the same. Four in ten Labour (41 per cent) predict the econmy will get better. Support for Labour is also down three points this month on 34 per cent, with the Conservatives unchanged on 31 per cent, the Lib Dems on 9 per cent and Ukip down four points to 11 per cent. Gideon Skinner, Head of Political Research at Ipsos MORI said: ‘With a year to go - and only a few weeks to the local and European elections - neither of the main parties will be feeling comfortable. ‘Labour’s average share this year is down four points from their 2012 average, but the Conservatives are also staying stubbornly in the low 30s, despite the best economic optimism we’ve seen in 36 years of asking the question.’","Jitters in Labour ranks after Tories secured a lead in several polls .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . This is the moment a moped gang attacked a terrified businessman with a hammer outside his £2million home before making off with his rare £60,000 Ferrari watch. The man, who is in his 50s, was sweeping outside his home in Hampstead, north London, when the gang of four pulled up outside the property on two mopeds. Sensing they were dangerous, the unidentified man attempted to defend himself with his broom. Scroll down to see video. CCTV footage shows a gang of four attacking a businessman as he was sweeping outside his £2million home. Pictured is the moment one of the gang grabs the man's broom from him before beating him with it . One of the men hits the victim, a man in his 50s, with the broom while another tries to take his £60,000 Ferrari watch from his arm. In the background, a third man watches on . One of the men lunges towards the man (out of shot) with a claw hammer in terrifying footage . However, one of the gang then grabbed the broom and hit him with it - pushing the man out towards the road. A third member then launched at the businessman with a hammer while the first robber hits the man with his broom - driving him back towards his house. Seconds later, a fourth drove onto the man's driveway in the shocking footage. At one point, one of the men took the victim's rare £60,000 watch from his arm. One of the men also took a gold chain from around his neck and his wedding ring. Eventually, the businessman managed to get to his house following the brutal attack on April 11  - closing the security gate behind him. Footage provided courtesy of London Evening Standard and London Live . After pushing the man back on to his driveway from the street, one of the gang takes the man's watch . A fourth gang member arrives on the scene on another moped - speeding in to the man's driveway . The gang then mounted their mopeds and drove off. The whole incident lasted just over a minute. The terrifying attack is the latest in a stream of similar incidents in the Hampstead area in the past few months. However, this is the first time the gang have been caught on CCTV. The traumatised man is now planning on fleeing the country as he is terrified the men will return. He told the Evening Standard: 'It isn’t a question of ‘if’ they come back. They will come back. I have been driven out of my own house and the country.' The victim told the newspaper he thinks he was attacked by the gang as he parks a sports car in the driveway of his £2 million home. Eventually, the men make off on their mopeds - leaving the businessman scared and shaken. The attack follows several similar incidents in the area - including one on footballer Alexander Merkel . Watford player Alexander Merkel had to fight off a four-strong gang of robbers at his home earlier this month . The Metropolitan Police have been contacted by MailOnline - who have said they will release a statement following clarification from an officer. This attack took place just three weeks before Watford transfer Alexander Merkel’s house was also raided by a moped gang - who attempted to break down his door. Speaking after the attack, the footballer said: 'I heard a commotion outside and went to have a look. Two mopeds with four people on the back were outside a neighbour's front door. 'One of the guys tried to kick it in but bounced off in a rather comical fashion. They then tried to ram it with their scooters.' The gang is believed to have struck in another street nearby an hour earlier. Detective Constable Andy Palmer, from Camden Police, said at the time: 'I am sure this gang is known to certain members of the community so I would urge them to contact police before someone is seriously hurt.' He said the two main suspects were aged between 18 and 25. One was 6ft tall, of slim build and with an Irish accent. The other was 6ft 2in and of medium build.","Resident in his 50s was sweeping outside his Hampstead, London, home .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Alexander Thomas, 30, faces jail after he was convicted of five counts of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity while in a position of trust . A pervert school teacher is facing jail after he was convicted of sexually abusing four teenage girls over Facebook. Alexander Thomas, 30, from Swindon, Wiltshire, used the social network site to groom the sixth form students - asking them to send him semi-naked photographs, a court heard. The PE and Business Studies teacher was convicted by a jury at Swindon Crown Court of five counts of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity while in a position of trust. He was bailed for sentencing on June 13. Judge Mousley told him: 'You will be bailed between now and then and that will be unconditional. 'You must not take that as an indication there will not be a prison . sentence. 'A custodial sentence is a probability at least in this case and may well be a certainty.' Thomas was arrested in October 2012 after teachers at his school became aware of rumours circulating between pupils. In a police interview, he admitted being in contact with four girls, aged between 16 and 17, but denied any sexual contact. He admitted having a topless picture of one of the girls. Prosecutors said Thomas asked them to send him photographs of themselves in their underwear. They also said he asked them to meet up with him for the purpose of sexual activity. A jury cleared him of directly engaging in sexual activity with two of the girls - but convicted him over his use of Facebook between August 2010 and October 2012. Judge Tim Mousley QC told the teacher he was likely to be sent to prison when he returns to the dock for sentencing on June 13. Swindon Crown Court, pictured, heard how the teacher would ask the pupils, aged between 16 and 17, to send him pictures of themselves in their underwear. He was cleared of any direct sexual activity with the girls between August 2010 and October 2012 . Speaking outside court Wiltshire Police’s child abuse investigator Detective Constable Angela Spray said: 'Thomas worked as a secondary school teacher in Wiltshire where he systematically abused the position of trust he was in to prey on vulnerable, underage children for his own sexual gratification. 'Thomas groomed his victims and encouraged them to engage in sexual acts after gaining their confidence and trust. 'He has refused to take any responsibility for his actions and has forced his victims to relieve their suffering and give evidence in court.'","Alexander Thomas, 30, used site to contact four sixth form students .

"By . Sam Webb . A woman has admitted neglecting a foal which has since been re-homed by Olympic dressage star Charlotte Dujardin. Lisa Fletcher, 47, was banned for keeping horses in October last year, after pleading guilty to three counts of neglecting a grey Arab stallion. But despite the ban, Fletcher, of Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, secretly kept two young horses in squalid conditions at another yard nearby. Olympic dressage champion Charlotte Dujardin with her rescued pony Santa, who was being kept in squalid conditions by Lisa Fletcher . A seven-month-old black foal and a bay colt - were severely emaciated when found by the RSPCA. Lisa Fletcher, (right)  leaves South Gloucestershire Magistrates Court in Stroud. She could be imprisoned for 18 weeks . Stroud Magistrates' Court heard Fletcher's deception was uncovered when the RSPCA were alerted to the horses by a member of the public. Both horses - a seven-month-old black foal and a bay colt estimated to be about two years old - were severely emaciated. Fletcher today admitted two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to two horses and one count of breaching a disqualification order banning her from keeping the animals. A police officer says Santa has 'gone from rags to riches' after being rescued . Julia Hurrel, chair of the bench, told Fletcher the offences fell into the most serious category, level three, and required a minimum 18 week prison sentence. 'It comes into the third level and that's because of the length of the neglect and the fact that these horses were hidden from the RSPCA and your previous sentence,' Ms Hurrel said. Fletcher was banned from keeping horses for five years and sentenced to a community order at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court on October 1 last year. While that case was under investigation, Fletcher acquired further horses, including the bay colt and black foal, which is now in the care of Ms Dujardin. On December 3, RSPCA inspector Suzi Smith was called to the DIY livery yard - where Fletcher was responsible for the full care of her horses - after the landlord raised concerns. Prosecuting, Rafe Turner said Ms Smith, who attended with a vet, found the horses stood in a yard with dirty water and an empty bucket by them. 'The foal was so emaciated that the body condition score was 0.5, not even one, where one is emaciated and five is obese. The colt had a body score of 1.5,' Mr Turner said. The animals were immediately seized and vets began intensive treatment to save them - with the foal requiring antibiotic injections twice a day for a severe lung infection. 'The period of suffering commenced within a very, very short space of time of the order actually being imposed by the court,' Mr Turner added. 'It is the most obvious and flagrant disregard of a court order in a very short space of time.' Mr Turner said the horses had little straw in their stables, which were strewn with faeces, and dirty water. In interview, Fletcher claimed she fed the horses a bale of hay every day from a local farmer but could not afford to give them more. Fletcher today admitted two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to two horses and one count of breaching a disqualification order banning her from keeping the animals . 'When asked about the condition of the black foal on December 3, she replied ""probably a bit ribby"",' Mr Turner said. 'That's entirely understating it.' Representing Fletcher, Nicola Colwill said her client, who lives with her father and brother, had tried to re-home the horses after the court order. 'She said she advertised, she asked around but couldn't find homes for them,' Ms Colwill said. 'She was desperately frightened of the situation coming to light because she knew she was in deep trouble when it did.' Speaking after the hearing, Inspector Smith said the black foal had experienced a 'rags to riches' story after being adopted by Ms Dujardin.

Big kiss: RSPCA inspector Suzi Smith with Santa, who is now thriving . 'The foal was very, very thin,' she said. 'The vet discovered he had a severe lung infection and was riddled with worms. I don't think he would have survived the week if we hadn't got the veterinary care he needed. 'Luckily he pulled through and has gone from rags to riches as he's been adopted by Olympic gold medallist Charlotte Dujardin who has named him Santa.' The other horse, called Frank, has since recovered and looking for a new home. Fletcher, who was released on unconditional bail, will be sentenced at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court on June 9.","Charlotte Dujardin behind 'rags to riches' transformation of foal .

"By . Amanda Williams . A pair of identical twin brothers who were caught fighting in a barbaric street brawl have both been given the same jail sentence - because police can’t tell them apart. Ryan and Grant Seymour, 19, were caught on CCTV - both naked from the waist up - taking part in mass violence, in Biddulph, Staffordshire, on July 6 last year. A court heard the siblings were seen pelting missiles including a portable television at members of a 'rival' family. Identical twin brothers Ryan and Grant Seymour were caught fighting in a barbaric street brawl and have both been given the same jail sentence - because police can't tell them apart . A court heard the twins also hurled vases and bottles at their victims  - with one brother attacking a group of men with a spanner. But because the brothers are almost impossible to tell apart it was 'unclear who did what' as both were naked from the waist up and wearing blue shorts. They have both sentenced to nine months' detention at a young offenders institute after officers could not work out which one had been involved in more of the violence. Jailing the pair at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court, Judge Paul Glenn said: 'Your conduct has been described by witnesses as mayhem, barbaric and vile. 'You were not the only people to behave disgracefully. 'There was undoubted provocation. 'A group of other men visited the house to cause trouble. Pictured is Ryan Seymour.  He and his twin were caught on CCTV  - both naked from the waist up - taking part in mass violence, in Biddulph, Staffordshire, on July 6 last year . A court heard the siblings were seen pelting missiles including a portable television at members of a 'rival' family. Pictured is Grant Seymour . 'That was the catalyst for what followed. 'The trouble started in the house and spilled out onto the street. We can see from the CCTV how close this was to the centre of Biddulph.' The court heard the vicious attack was sparked when members of the Yoxall family banged on the door of the twins’ friend Daniel Tatters’s home. Prosecuting Oliver Woolhouse, said: 'A witness living in South View described hearing a disturbance in the street. 'He could see from his living room window four men go into a house. 'A short time later a man was heard hammering on the door, it was opened and he went inside, followed by six others. 'A Peugeot 306 car and a van appeared and the occupants of the car got out and stood by the front door. 'A man then appeared, he was bleeding heavily from his head and was followed by the rest of the men. 'They were shouting at each other and there was something of a stand-off. The twins also hurled missiles at their victims  - with one brother attacking a group of men with a spanner. But because the brothers (left Ryan and right Grant) are impossible to tell apart it was 'unclear who did what' Probably the most famous twins in criminal history were Ronnie and Reggie Kray from Bethnal Green in east London. It was reported that early on in their careers, both twins were arrested for a particularly vicious assault but the police did not prosecute because they could not identify which twin was the assailant. Since identical twins - also known as monozygotic twins - come from the same fertilised egg, it was believed that they have the same DNA. However, a new test is being developed which would enable twins' DNA to be told apart by scientists in Germany. They have found a subtle genetic difference which means there is now a definitive test to learn which twin was at the scene of a crime. This breakthrough will stop the current procedure whereby one twin might escape justice because of the inability of the authorities to tell them apart. 'The witness says one of the twins had a small portable TV that was thrown through the car window. 'Glass bottles and vases were also thrown at the vehicle before the driver of the car attempted to drive away. 'One of the twins then attacked the vehicle with a large metal spanner. His arm was bleeding.' The pair both admitted one count of affray and Ryan was also caged for a further 15 months to run consecutively for an unrelated affray for an earlier incident. Jason Holt, defending Ryan, said: 'It is accepted that the other family came to the house of Daniel Tatters and that’s what caused this incident in the first place. 'They even blocked both ends of the road with a car and a van. 'Mr Seymour has matured since this incident, he is no longer the angry man he once was. 'He even apologises to the people of South View who saw this going on.' Robert Smith, defending Grant, added: 'Since this offence in July last year there has not been any further incident involving Grant. 'He is now a roofer and has stuck at it. He has reduced his drinking and now has a stable life. He has been out of trouble.' Co-accused, Daniel Tatters, 29, and Peter Holland, 36, both from Biddulph, were each handed a 12-month community order, with supervision for 12 months, and ordered to carry out 100 hours unpaid work.","Ryan and Grant Seymour, 19, caught brawling in street on CCTV .

"By . Martin Robinson . Extraordinary: A Tube driver who put a poster of the Queen (pictured yesterday) up at work has been suspended from his office . A Tube driver who put up a poster of the Queen at work has been suspended after a colleague accused him of creating a 'hostile' environment. London Underground has removed the framed A4 image and another picture on a desk from an Essex depot while they investigate the complaint, it has been revealed today. The suspended driver's union today criticised the 'bizarre' suspension and want it reversed. But the Central Line worker who complained said the issue was also about wider allegations of bullying and intimidation. The A4 picture of the Queen and a smaller portrait were removed on Friday, after a year on display. It is understood that the two drivers had repeatedly clashed over the images because they had 'vastly differing political allegiances', a source told the Evening Standard. They are also members of rival unions, the suspended driver is an Aslef member while the complainant is a RMT member. The latter has said the stress of the case has forced him to take sick leave. 'I’ve had a lot of time off work with stress with threats made against my family and my home. It’s been rumbling on for a couple of years but the London Underground have said I can’t say anything,' he told the Standard. The suspended staff member's union organiser, Finn Brennan said today the driver denied all allegations of harrassment. 'It is extraordinary that a public corporation under the control of Boris Johnson is instructing staff to remove photographs of the Queen. We have written to the company to ask them for an immediate investigation and for this bizarre decision to be reversed,' he told the Standard. Row: The two men at the centre of the 'extraordinary' case are based at the Central Line depot in Loughton, Essex (pictured) London Underground suspended him as they investigated the poster and also messages on social media. Peter McNaught, Operations Director of the Central line, said: 'Following a dispute between two members of staff on the Central line, a full investigation is being carried out by senior managers and a member of staff has been suspended pending the outcome. 'We take all claims of bullying and harassment extremely seriously and do not tolerate such behaviour in the workplace.'","London Underground has removed poster and desk portrait from depot .

"By . Darren Boyle . A veterinary nurse has received a suspended jail sentence after abandoning her starving dog on a Birmingham street, before it was later put down. A court heard Ann Marie Nash’s emaciated five-year-old bulldog, Martha, had suffered for a 'prolonged' period. Nash, 38, from Erdington, Birmingham was sentenced to 12 weeks imprisonment, suspended for a year, after previously admitting animal cruelty. Former veterinary nurse Anne Marie Nash received a suspended jail sentence at Birmingham Magistrates Court after admitting animal cruelty . Nash left her starving and emaciated bulldog Martha in the gutter after putting out the rubbish . She was also ordered to do 100 hours unpaid work, pay £200 costs and was banned from keeping any animal for five years. Julia Kettle, prosecuting for Birmingham City Council, said the bulldog was found collapsed in St Thomas Road, Erdington, on July 10 last year by a dog warden, who had been called out by a concerned member of the public. She was found to be extremely emaciated and had a swollen stomach and ingrowing nails. The dog was later examined by a veterinary surgeon who discovered a 'football size' lump in its stomach, which was believed to be a tumour. Miss Kettle said a medical examination indicated the animal had been suffering for about two weeks. After the dog was put down, a post mortem examination revealed it had a blockage of bones in its stomach. Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard that Nash could no longer afford to care for Martha after losing her job and had to rely on food banks to feed herself . Attempts to find the owner led to a rescue centre and then to Nash. When quizzed the defendant claimed she had given Martha away two weeks previously. Joanne Outhwaite, defending, said Nash, who had completed her veterinary nurse training 14 years ago, was extremely remorseful for what had happened. She said she started to suffer from depression seven years ago following the death of her father, had lost her job and found it difficult to cope. Under stress Nash had taken out the rubbish, Martha had followed her and she had then shut the door on the dog. She had hoped someone would take her in, her solicitor claimed. Investigators from Birmingham City Council were able to track down Nash as Martha had been micro-chipped. Ms Outhwaite told Birmingham Magistrates' Court that her client had been caring for the dog in an appropriate manner until she had lost her job. 'Miss Nash is extremely remorseful and will remember what has happened for a long time to come. 'She took the dog on because of her position fostering animals. Things started to come to a head when she lost her job and she started suffering from depression. 'She was forced to rely on food banks, was facing eviction and was struggling to maintain her own health. 'She accepts that she should have sought assistance and she sincerely regrets that she was not in a right frame of mind to do so. Nash, pictured, qualified as a veterinarian nurse 14 years ago but lost her job after the death of her father . Jacqui Kennedy, director of regulation and enforcement for Birmingham City Council, said: 'This sad case highlights how important it is for people to look after their pets and they owe them a duty of care. 'While many pet owners love their animals and take good care of them, ensuring they are well fed and maintained, there are some who do not understand their responsibility, and unfortunately our dog wardens are seeing more of these kinds of cases. 'This is why it’s so important to highlight what can happen to the owner, as well as their pet, if they are neglected or disowned, and the judge was very clear that Miss Nash will go to prison if she breaks the terms of her sentence.'","Ann Marie Nash trained as a veterinary nurse 14 years ago but lost her job .

"By . Dale O'donnell . and David Tyrer . and Peter Wood . and Steven Allweis . After one Premier League, four FA Cups, a League Cup and the Champions League, Ashley Cole looks to have played his last game for Chelsea. The left-back has tweeted he's weighing up his options for next season and he doesn't believe the west Londoners will be one of them. But where will he end up? Many would argue the 33-year-old would improve the first teams of Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City. So, we decided to ask the fan websites of those teams - even former club Arsenal - whether they would like to sign the recently-retired England international. LIVERPOOL . David Tyrer: Live4Liverpool . If you were to ask any Liverpool fan whether they'd take Cole, even on a free transfer, the resounding answer would be 'no!' There's something eminently unlikeable about Cole. But given some time, you can see the sense in it: he's vastly experienced, won it all (many times) and his game doesn't rely on speed or pace so, at 33, you'd get two or three more years out of him. And, given his recent retirement from England duty, he'd be fully focused on the job. We may not like it, but he'd be a quality acquisition and save us a fortune. Follow Live4Liverpool on Twitter at @live4liverpool . On his way? Chelsea's Ashley Cole has tweeted that he expects to leave Stamford Bridge this summer . MANCHESTER UNITED . Dale O'Donnell: Stretty News . The transformation of full-backs in the last 10-15 years has seen their job description change from not only being able to defend well, but to get forward effectively too. Cole was one of the pioneers of attacking full-back play, but after eight successful years at Chelsea, he is now in search of a new club. It will most likely be his last. The 33-year-old is a fine example of a modern day full-back, but his best days are long gone. Which is why Manchester United are looking increasingly likely to sign Luke Shaw, who is without doubt the most promising full-back England has seen since Cole broke onto the scene at Arsenal. There are also ongoing discussions to keep Patrice Evra at the club for another year. The former French captain is a better role model, on and off the pitch, for Shaw to learn under. Follow Stretty News on Twitter @StrettyNews . Trophies: Cole won the Premier League, four FA Cups, one League Cup and Champions League at Chelsea . MANCHESTER CITY . Steven Allweis: View From a Blue . In the final stages of last season, Cole demonstrated that he still retains the competitive edge and defensive instinct to compete at a decent level. But the reality is that if he weren’t English, there would be no rumours linking him with City. However, such is our need to adhere to the quotas, there has been the odd mention about his possible arrival. Will it happen? I very much doubt it. Would I like it to happen? Again, probably not. He has his uses and I’m sure he’ll be a good short-term signing for someone, but he’s no better going forward than Aleks Kolarov, whose place in the squad he would likely take. Left-back is not City’s strongest position, but I’m far from convinced a 33-year-old Ashley Cole is the answer. Follow View from a Blue on Twitter @viewfromablue . Veteran: Cole retired from international football earlier this month after winning 107 caps for England . ARSENAL . Peter Wood: Le Grove . Ashley Cole back to Arsenal? On the face of it, it’s a no. The man is an odious blight on the memory of most Arsenal fans. But then I think about why he might be leaving Chelsea. Jose Mourinho, out of the Premier League game for six years has come back and he’s proved he is now the 'specialist in failure'. Cole wants to win trophies on the back nine of his career. Mourinho hasn’t won anything for two years, he’s upsetting players, selling his best names, looking and sounding like a bit of a nutter, choking with an incredible squad… Ashley probably wants to move London’s most trophy-laden club this season. I’d take him back as a reserve, providing he promised not to crash his Bentley when he sees the pay-as-you-play contract I’d have on offer.
