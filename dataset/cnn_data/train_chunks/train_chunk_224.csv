"(CNN) -- Much like President Obama, the Occupy movement is alive and well and entering its second term, thank you very much. It's no longer about squatting in public parks, getting on the news, or -- in some cases -- getting arrested. No, instead this decentralized, bottom-up, anti-Wall Street effort is taking aim at your medical, student and other loans: It aims to relieve your debt. Just as Obama appears to have left the lofty rhetoric of ""being the change"" behind him as he confronts the more practical realities of working a financial plan through an intransigent Congress, the occupiers have given up on winning media mindshare or public support and have turned instead to direct action that helps real people. In its Act 2, Occupy is just occupying the space where it's needed. Remember, Occupy does not have leaders, an administration or some central office. It's not a single body with a mission control that makes particular decisions. It began as a one-day demonstration in New York, ""Occupy Wall Street,"" spawned by an announcement from the anti-corporate Adbusters magazine, and then mushroomed into similar encampments around the United States and in other parts of the world. Although police eventually shut down these demonstrations, the social and Internet infrastructure of the movement remained intact. People met one another over the course of the demonstrations, forged relationships online and continued working in their own ways. Different members in different places have chosen to concern themselves with particular problems. Those that resonate with others in the loose collective end up getting support from the various websites and Facebook pages already associated with the Occupy movement. While there is no ""official"" Occupy movement, when an effort gains support from enough of the trusted Occupy networks, it can be considered a de facto Occupy action. Most recently, the movement came to the rescue of hurricane victims with Occupy Sandy - a bottom-up, people-driven recovery effort that rivaled FEMA for its ability to bring aid to the people who needed it. The Occupy brand credibility, so to speak, as well as its existing networking infrastructure gave activists a great head start in connecting donors, organizers and providers to victims in the worst-hit areas. Now, a growing contingent within the greater movement is refocusing on Occupy's original victims, the hundreds of thousands of people burdened with all sorts of debt. Many of the debtors owe many times the original amounts they charged up on their credit cards, medical bills or student loans. Such debt is bought and sold on a debt market for pennies on the dollar by debt collection agencies and others capable of pressuring the debtors most effectively. (The reason debt is sold for such a small fraction of its acute value is that most collectors will not be able to recoup the money. They might buy $10,000 of credit card company from a bank or reseller, but most likely only be able to collect a tiny portion of it from the debtors, who either go bankrupt or simply broke.) In the belief that much of this debt is comprised of unjustified fees, inappropriate credit products or even outright fraud, an offshoot of Occupy called Strike Debt is working to erase it all...by purchasing it, and then forgiving it. Yes, seems it's that easy: Buy debt for a tiny fraction of its face value in the same way that credit agencies buy debt. But then, instead of attempting to collect that money, simply erase it. Families struggling to pay for the compound interest on their 1990s medical bills, for example, simply find out that it's been relieved. The whole debt-rolling operation, known as Rolling Jubilee, begins on November 15, with a variety show and telethon in New York City entitled The People's Bailout. Occupy-friendly celebrities from comedian Janeane Garofalo and Daily Show writer Lizz Winstead to music legends such as Sonic Youth's Lee Ranaldo and Fugazi's Guy Picciotto will perform for a live and -- of course -- streaming audience while the website accepts donations. According to their estimates, every $25 will abolish an estimated $500 worth of debt. According to David Rees, one of the founders of Strike Debt and a leading voice in the Rolling Jubillee, ""As a test run, we spent $500, which bought $14,000 of distressed debt. We then ERASED THAT DEBT."" Of course, in a perfect world, debtors would have the opportunity to erase their own debt at this rate. Or, at the very least, on hearing that their debt has been relieved, the rescued debtors would want to pay back the movement so that more debt could be relieved. Currently, legal restrictions and privacy policies prevent this sort of traction from developing. But if you're in a tight debt situation and learn that it has been mysteriously and anonymously forgiven, you might want to consider doing the same for someone else by contributing. I understand why people might object to this scheme and can already envision the comments forming below this piece as I write. Isn't this moral hazard? Didn't those people get in their own debt? Why should we bail out people who have gotten into trouble like this? The best answer, of course, is that we already bailed out the banks and creditors -- with tax money. Why not bail out the actual people? And the Occupiers are not focusing on home loans taken out by aggressive real estate speculators, but the personal debt that has already been well documented to be ripe for abuse and fraud by lending institutions and their agents. (The easier answer is that if you don't like this idea, simply do not take part. If you find your debt occupied and relieved, you can surely find banks and credit agencies willing to accept your payments.) More significant, at least from my perspective, is how actions such as Occupy Sandy and Strike Debt reflect a movement coming of age. True to form, Occupy is making no demands of government, of banks or of anyone else. The occupiers did not involve themselves in the recent elections -- as if electoral politics were just too many steps removed from getting anything done. Instead, they simply occupy the space around those in the greatest need and fill in for what's missing. The opinion expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Douglas Rushkoff: The Occupy movement, in its second term, aims to relieve your debt .
He says Occupy involved itself on the ground with Superstorm Sandy, providing needed relief .

"(CNN) -- Pending final approval from the Centers for Disease Control, Princeton University is preparing to provide a vaccine targeting a strain of meningitis in the wake of a campus outbreak, the school said Monday. The CDC was preparing to recommend that all Princeton undergraduates and graduate students living in dormitories receive the vaccine, the Ivy League school said in a statement. Other members of the university community should be vaccinated if they have conditions where the spleen is compromised or immune system disorders, the statement said. The recommendations are still pending the review of the CDC's Independent Review Board, the CDC said Monday. ""Pending final CDC approval, the university is prepared to accept these recommendations and make arrangements to provide access to this vaccine as soon as possible,"" the Princeton statement said. Princeton has seen seven cases of meningitis, a potentially fatal illness, since March. Only one vaccine exists to target meningococcal bacteria known as type B, the strain that appears responsible for the outbreak. This vaccine is called Bexsero and is made by Novartis. It has not been licensed for use in the United States, but it was approved this year in Europe and Australia. The Princeton situation is the first outbreak of this strain since the vaccine was licensed in those countries. The necessary doses would need one to two months to get to Princeton, according to Novartis spokeswoman Julie Masow. Bexsero is manufactured in Italy, Masow said. The university would cover the cost of the vaccine for all students who receive it. Two doses are required to protect individuals against this rare disease. Princeton hopes to make the first two doses of the vaccine available in early December, and the second in February. The meningococcal vaccines already available in the United States to college students would not protect them against this serogroup B bacteria. The university, the New Jersey Department of Health and the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are discussing options to control the outbreak, CDC spokeswoman Sharon Hoskins said Monday. Before the news of the possible CDC recommendation on Monday afternoon, Princeton's board of trustees had met over the weekend to consider whether to offer students the vaccine on a voluntary basis. Princeton sophomore Joshua Zuckerman, a politics major, said in an e-mail he hasn't seen a lot of serious worry or obsessive hygiene among his classmates, but he has observed ""an abundance of caution when it comes to sharing drinks and food."" Since media coverage began, the meningitis outbreak has been a hot topic of conversation, said Lauren Morera, a junior majoring in operations research and financial engineering. Morera and Zuckerman both said they would take the vaccine if it becomes available. ""If the vaccine is offered, I see no reason not to take it,"" Zuckerman said. ""If the Europeans and Australians have claimed it is safe, I have no doubt it is so."" Steps to get the vaccine . More decisions must be made before vaccinations can begin, said Barbara Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration told the CDC it would allow for the importation of the vaccine for this limited use, the center said. ""We have been allowed to have the option to import the vaccine, but the decision to vaccinate has not been made,"" Reynolds said. ""We're in discussions."" The final decision, which would come in concert with medical staff and university administrators, could be made sometime this week, Reynolds said. If the university gives a nod to the vaccine, another set of decisions will need to be made about how and when vaccinations will take place, Reynolds said. Informed consent forms would also need to be approved before the vaccine could be offered to students, she said. The CDC is asking the FDA how quickly the vaccine can be imported into the United States and whether it will require label changes, Reynolds said. What is meningitis group B? There are two forms of meningitis: bacterial and viral. The bacterial form is rare in the United States, and the group B bacterial strains are even more rare. Symptoms can include stiff neck, headache, fever, vomiting, rashes, sensitivity to light and confusion. Untreated, the disease can lead to complications such as hearing impairment, brain damage, limb amputations and death. Antibiotic treatment of the most common types of bacterial meningitis ""should reduce the risk of dying from meningitis to below 15%, although the risk remains higher among young infants and the elderly,"" according to the CDC. Meningitis is an infection of the membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord, known as the meninges. In 2012, there were 480 cases of bacterial meningitis in the United States, according to the CDC. Of those, 160 were group B. ""Usually, when you see this kind of meningitis on the campus, it's meningitis C,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University, in a telephone interview with CNN. ""This is very, very unusual."" Schaffner added that, in the United States, group B meningitis typically strikes infants and only rarely adolescents and young adults. Though the mechanism needed for health officials to administer an unapproved vaccine in the United States is ""very elaborate,"" it would be justified in this case, Schaffner said. ""If I were around the table with the board of trustees, I would be gently encouraging them to do this."" No common link among cases . The first reported case at Princeton developed in a student who had returned to the campus after spring recess in March, according to the state health department. Two months later, after several other students and one visitor had contracted the disease, an outbreak was declared. All have recovered except for the most recent case, a student who began experiencing symptoms November 8 and was taken to a hospital two days later, officials said. No common link has been identified among the cases, New Jersey health officials said. But five cases have the same strain, according to the department, and a sixth case is similar. Test results on the seventh and most recent case were not yet available. The disease is not wholly understood. Cases of meningococcal disease, including Group B, have dropped in recent years to the lowest levels since the 1930s. ""Nobody knows why,"" Schaffner said. And cases sometimes occur more frequently in Oregon. ""We've never understood that, either."" The New Jersey outbreak is also puzzling. ""Why this is occurring is not clear, but the trick everybody is working on is how to stop it, how to prevent further cases,"" he said. If the Princeton board approves, as many as 8,000 undergraduate and graduate students at the school could be offered the vaccine. Meningitis can spread via the exchange of saliva and other respiratory secretions through kissing, coughing, sharing drinks and living in close quarters, such as in dormitories, according to the health department. The bacteria can reside for months in the back of the throat before causing symptoms, Schaffner said. Princeton's latest health advisory on the situation tells the university community that ""increasing hygienic practices, and not sharing drinking glasses, eating utensils, smoking materials and other items"" can help prevent the spread of the disease. In the meantime, classes are continuing, and so are football games. Per a tradition dating back to the late 1800s, Princeton will celebrate this season's football victories over Harvard and Yale with a bonfire. CNN's Miriam Falco, Alexandra Field, Chris Welch, Tom Watkins and Haley Draznin contributed to this report.","CDC preparing to recommend students get meningitis B vaccine .

"Washington (CNN) -- Texas Republican Congressman Roger Williams was especially stunned as he sat in school on November 22, 1963, and heard President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. Earlier that morning, he stood outside the Fort Worth Hotel with his mother and shook the President's hand right before he got on a plane and flew to Dallas. ""I literally was the last person to shake his hand as he left the hotel,"" Williams told CNN. He was 14 years old at the time. Now a 64-year-old freshman member of the House of Representatives, Williams sat in his Capitol Hill office on Wednesday and recounted in vivid detail the day he said he would never forget, and a moment that would later spark his own interest in public service. Boy who witnessed JFK assassination recalls the day . ""It was pouring rain, it was cold on November 22nd,"" Williams said, describing the morning he headed to a breakfast for the President and the first lady at the Fort Worth Hotel. Williams and his mother sat inside the ballroom with 1,000 others. He told CNN he recalls seeing Mrs. Kennedy's ""bright pink suit"" and listening to the President talk about the economy, the need for a strong military, and his idea for a man to reach the moon. His father, Jack Williams, an owner of car dealerships, was asked by his friend Jim Wright, the Democratic congressman from the area, to supply several cars for the President's motorcade for his visit to Fort Worth. In return for his help, Williams' father asked Wright if his wife and son could meet the President. After the speech, he and his mother were approached by someone and ushered to the front of the hotel where Jacqueline Kennedy emerged . ""She came around the corner in that pink dress and she shook my mother's hand and shook my hand and stood right next to me."" Williams said. But then the ""moment:"" Williams says the President appeared, took a puff of his cigar, discarded it, and then grasped his mother's hand and turned to him. ""He came to me and shook my hand and did not let it go, and looked back at my mother and said 'It was a pleasure to meet your son.' "" Kennedy then left for Dallas. 50 years on, the enduring lessons of JFK's presidency . Williams remembers wanting to know what kind of shoes the President of the United States would wear, and inspected them that morning, describing them as ""black cat toe shoes."" After he met Kennedy, his mother took him to school. Later as he sat in Latin class, the principal handed his teacher a note, and Williams watched as his teacher's head fell to his desk and he wept. ""I couldn't fathom it frankly because I had just seen him an hour and half ago,"" Williams said. The Texas Republican said after Kennedy was killed ""the world changed."" His generation was never the same and the country shifted from a ""happy society"" to one that experienced a series of events like the shootings at Kent State and the assassination of Robert Kennedy. An emotional Williams told CNN, ""John Kennedy -- he touched my heart and soul."" JFK assassination a collective memory for American children . Though he's now an ideological opposite of the Democratic president he praised and admired, Williams said meeting Kennedy was part of his journey to run for office. ""It eventually empowered me to do something for my country, like he did,"" recalling Kennedy's famous line from his inauguration speech, ""Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country."" Williams played baseball for the Atlanta Braves after college. But after an injury, he followed his father into the car business, running a string of dealerships in Texas. He became involved in politics when George W. Bush served as governor of Texas. He later served as Texas secretary of state under Gov. Rick Perry. 5 things you might not know about JFK's assassination . He admits his conservative leanings differ from JFK's, but Williams believes he has a lot in common politically with things Kennedy pushed in office, citing tax cuts, a strong military, and a message that the U.S. is the dominant world power. Kennedy's great nephew, Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Joe Kennedy III, was elected in the same class as Williams. The Congressman told CNN he's talked to Kennedy about other experiences but never what it was like to meet his great uncle that day 50 years ago. After telling his story of November 22, 1963, he said, ""I think I'm going to reach out to him and just kind of let him know my story.""","'I literally was the last person to shake his hand as he left the hotel,"" Texas congressman recalls .

"London (CNN) -- Keepers at London Zoo are ""distraught"" after a newborn tiger cub -- the first Sumatran tiger born there for 17 years -- drowned in a pool at its enclosure. The animal was born to five-year-old first-time-mom Melati just three weeks ago, and its arrival was greeted with huge excitement and celebration at the zoo, where experts were ""over-the-moon"" about the birth. But on Saturday, keepers raised the alarm when they could no longer see the young tiger on cameras inside its den; a search of the enclosure revealed the animal's body. It is thought Melati carried the cub out into the paddock area of the zoo's ""Tiger Territory,"" where it fell into the pond and drowned. ""We're heartbroken by what's happened,"" said London Zoo's Malcolm Fitzpatrick. Melati is said to be a very nervous tiger who prefers routine, and experts at the zoo had opted to allow her full access to the whole enclosure fearing that any changes to her environment might cause her to injure or abandon her cub. ""At the time we thought it was in the best interests of Melati and her cub to allow her continued access to the full enclosure as normal,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""We didn't want to put her on edge by changing her surroundings or routines, in case she abandoned or attacked the cub."" London Zoo is to carry out a full review of the circumstances which led to the cub's death. ""We would do anything to turn back the clock, and nobody could be more upset about what's happened than the keepers who work with the tigers every day,"" said Fitzpatrick. They are devoted to those tigers and are distraught."" The zoo had kept Melati's pregnancy a secret for about 105 days before her cub was born on September 22. Hidden cameras were installed in her enclosure to keep watch over her throughout, and the speedy birth, which lasted just six minutes, was also caught on video.","Keepers ""heartbroken"" as tiger cub found dead in enclosure at London Zoo .

"(CNN) -- As an athlete, I enjoy competition -- but there is a battle happening off the field that is more important: the fight to end polio. This fight is personal to me. I grew up in Nigeria, where I contracted polio at the age of 3. It was tough being the only kid on the playground in a wheelchair. For years I watched the other kids play, and when I tried to participate, they moved away from me. Thanks to the encouragement of my father, I persevered. After a lot of hard work and practice, I eventually regained full mobility in my right leg and have gone on to compete in track and field in the Paralympics. No child should have to go through what I did, especially when we have a vaccine to prevent it. Yet today, polio continues to cripple children in some parts of the world. There is good news. Polio is more than 99% eliminated worldwide, and there are fewer cases than ever before. In 1988, 125 countries were fighting polio, and more than 350,000 children contracted the disease each year. Today, we have fewer than 200 cases, and polio remains endemic in just three countries: Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan. As we commemorate World Polio Day on Wednesday, eradication is within reach. Why polio hasn't gone away yet . This progress did not happen by accident. It happened because the global community launched an unprecedented effort called the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, a partnership that includes the World Health Organization, Rotary International, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UNICEF and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Thanks to this initiative and the work of many others, we are closer than ever to shutting the door on polio. But we can't stop now. The last percent is always the toughest, and if we don't finish the job, polio could return with a vengeance. According to WHO, if we don't end polio now, more than 10 million children under the age of 5 could be paralyzed by the disease in the next 40 years. That's a risk too big to take. We owe it to our own children -- and to all children -- to seize this moment and end this disabling disease. Polio anywhere is a threat to children everywhere. Our progress to date shows that when the world acts, we can achieve big things. That's why world leaders came together last month at the United Nations to reaffirm their commitment to ending polio and to issue an urgent call to fill a funding gap that threatens to undo the progress that has been made. The United Nations Foundation's Shot@Life campaign is carrying this message forward and empowering individual Americans to join the fight against polio. Through Shot@Life, Americans can raise awareness and funds to help the United Nations immunize children in developing countries against polio and other diseases. UNICEF and others are doing amazing work delivering polio immunizations, including in hard-to-reach places where the fight against polio will be won or lost. They need our support. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make history and finally eradicate polio from our planet. Each of us can make a difference this World Polio Day. To this very day, my mother gets tears in her eyes when she describes the moment she found out that I was paralyzed. Together, we can wipe out polio and ensure that one day no parent has to share that same fate. Opinion: Don't fall at the finish line in the race to eradicate polio . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dennis Ogbe.","Paralympian Dennis Ogbe contracted polio at age 3 in his native Nigeria .

"(CNN) -- Three Maryland teenagers were arrested on Sunday in Baltimore after authorities found they possessed 70 boxes of ammunition belonging to the U.S. Air Marshals . The surprising discovery started early Sunday morning with patrol officers checking a parked black Chevy that appeared to have hit a curb. The vehicle had its lights off, and the three suspects were sitting inside, police said. The officers found 70 boxes of ammunition that are for law enforcement use only, according to a police report. None of the suspects could justify their possession of the ammunition, the report said, adding that the driver -- 18-year-old Brandon Michael Shreve of Linthicum, Maryland -- gave the police consent to the vehicle search. Officers also found bolt cutters, flashlights, latex gloves and other auto parts inside the vehicle, according to the report. Police said that Shreve later admitted he had broken into a trailer. Both the trailer and the recovered ammunition belong to the U.S. Air Marshals, police added. Shreve also admitted to breaking into a Ford Mustang vehicle, according to the police. All three suspects -- including two others ages 15 and 16 -- have been charged, police said. Under most circumstances, CNN's policy is not to name juveniles accused of crimes.","70 boxes of ammunition are discovered in an early Sunday morning search .

"(CNN) -- In the wake of an online video in which soldiers returning from Afghanistan complained that Delta Air Lines charged their unit more than $2,800 in bag-check fees, two rival carriers on Thursday said they will loosen their checked-bag restrictions for active-duty military members. American Airlines announced it will allow military personnel to check an extra two bags with no out-of-pocket expense, and AirTran Airways said later Thursday it will waive baggage charges for ""members of the military who are traveling on active duty orders."" The airline's policy is identical to that of Southwest Airlines, which acquired AirTran in a merger last September, AirTran spokesman Christopher White told CNN. American Airlines airline will have policy fully implemented ""in the next few days,"" spokeswoman Dori Robau Alvarez said in a statement released Thursday. The airlines were the latest of the major U.S. carriers to change their policies. Delta and Continental/United announced Wednesday they were loosening their checked-bag policies for military personnel. Previously, American Airlines allowed three bags to be checked free, ""with full government reimbursement to military personnel on any bags above that number,"" but the carrier decided to increase the free-bag limit to five, ""given the potential confusion with different military units carrying different amounts of bags depending on their mission,"" according to the statement. The statement continued: ""Both our revised 5-bag policy as well as the previous policy allowed active military personnel traveling either on orders or on personal travel to utilize our military bag policy. In addition, American also allows military personnel traveling on orders to have one of their free bags weigh up to 100 pounds and (to be) 126 linear inches in size without penalty. ... This greatly helps with the typical, large military duffel bags."" Its limits on other bags are 50 pounds and 62 linear inches, it said. AirTran's fee waiver also comes with some size and weight restrictions: ""As long as each piece of baggage does not exceed 100 pounds in weight and 80 inches in size (length plus width plus height), you will be exempt from baggage charges, and will not be subject to excess, oversized, or overweight baggage charges,"" White said in an e-mail to CNN . The Delta incident got instant notoriety after servicemen spoke out about their experience in a video posted on YouTube. In the clip, which the men say was recorded on board a Delta flight from Baltimore to Atlanta on Tuesday, a day after they returned from Afghanistan, the soldiers explain they had ""a little issue with the bags."" CNN affiliate WXIA in Atlanta identified the soldiers as U.S. Army Staff Sgts. Fred Hilliker and Robert O'Hair. The men, who were bound for Fort Polk, Louisiana, said their military travel orders allowed them to carry up to four bags, but when they arrived at the airport in Baltimore, Delta told them it allowed military personnel to check only three bags for free. Members of the unit who were traveling with four bags ended up paying out of pocket for their extra luggage, the soldiers said in the video. They were charged $200 per extra bag, so the 34-member unit ended up paying more than $2,800 in bag fees, the soldiers said. Any extra bag fees charged by an airline will be reimbursed by the government, a military spokeswoman told CNN affiliate WGCL in Atlanta. One of the soldiers in the video said the bag he had to pay for was a weapons case that contained ""the tools that I used to protect myself and Afghan citizens while I was deployed in the country."" The other man then looked into the camera, exasperated. ""Good business model, Delta,"" he said sarcastically. ""Not happy. Not happy at all,"" he added, shaking his head. On Wednesday, Delta changed its policy: Effective immediately, U.S. military personnel traveling on orders are now allowed to check up to four bags for free in coach and five bags in first class and business class. Delta spokeswoman Susan Elliot on Thursday said the airline will reimburse the complaining soldiers for any fourth-bag fees that the military will not cover, and is giving them travel vouchers good for future trips. United/Continental also announced Wednesday it will allow more bags. ""United and Continental are waiving the fourth checked bag fee for military personnel traveling on orders in recognition of their sacrifice and service to our country,"" Christen David, a spokeswoman for United/Continental Airlines, said in an e-mail. The two airlines closed a merger deal in October. Delta said it deeply respects and admires men and women in uniform and added that it has worked hard to ensure that U.S. military personnel get ""additional flexibility"" when they travel on the carrier. The carrier said it's ""continuing to work with the soldiers individually to make this situation right for each of them."" The soldiers may have been misinformed about how many bags traveling active duty military personnel can check for free, according to Stars and Stripes, the independent news organization focusing on the military. CNN's A. Pawlowski and Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.","NEW:AirTran Airways waives bag fees for active-duty military .

"(CNN) -- A day after Miriam Carey ran a barricade and led police on a high-velocity chase through the middle of the nation's capital, authorities were searching for clues to explain the bizarre chain of events that led to her death. Although Carey was shot while driving with her baby, the child was uninjured. Many questions surrounding those facts remain. Related: Was the shooting justified? Here's what we know about Carey, a 34-year-old who reportedly had worked as a dental hygienist in Connecticut. Boyfriend: She thought the president was monitoring her . A law enforcement source involved in the investigation said Thursday that Carey's boyfriend had told police last winter that she appeared to be delusional. The boyfriend said she claimed President Barack Obama had placed Stamford, Connecticut, where she lived, under lockdown and that her house was under electronic surveillance, the source said. He told police that she was suffering from postpartum depression, was having trouble sleeping and was on medication. Carey underwent a mental health evaluation, the source said. Related: What is postpartum psychosis? Authorities have not officially linked the incident to mental illness or any other factor. Postpartum psychosis . A few months after her daughter was born, Miriam Carey was diagnosed with postpartum depression with psychosis, her sister told CNN's AC360. Postpartum psychosis can cause delusions and paranoia, according to medical experts. ""There wasn't a pattern. It was something that occurred suddenly,"" Amy Carey-Jones said. ""She seemed overwhelmed. There was a lot of stress. ""There was not moments of her walking around with delusions. That was not what was going on."" But her sister was making progress with the help of counseling and medications. Carey-Jones said her sister recently told her that the doctors told her she didn't need the medication anymore. ""They tapered her off the medications, and she said she felt fine,"" Carey-Jones said. She declined to discuss what medication Miriam Carey had taken. Her home . Carey lived in an apartment that authorities searched Friday. Medication . During the search, authorities found discharge papers from a 2012 mental health evaluation that listed prescriptions for medications to treat depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder -- a law enforcement source briefed on the investigation said Friday. Earlier, sources said investigators found medications, but that proved later not to be accurate. Authorities found a laptop computer, a flash drive and three non-working cell phones, the source said. A letter . The source told CNN that Carey left a letter addressed to the boyfriend at her apartment and that it appeared to contain white powder. The letter was being tested for hazardous substances. The baby girl . After surviving a high-speed police chase with Carey at the wheel, authorities placed the girl with a foster family, a spokesperson for Washington's Child and Family Services Agency told CNN. During the chase, no shots were fired from the Infinity, CNN's Deborah Feyerick reported. All shots were from law enforcement directed at the passenger side of the car. New York relatives . In Brooklyn in New York City, where Carey's mother and one of her four sisters live, a neighbor reported seeing the suspect Tuesday picking up her daughter. When federal agents arrived to conduct questioning, no one at the apartment answered the door. Carey's Facebook page includes a map pinpointing Stamford and New York. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Carol Cratty, Deborah Feyerick, and Joe Johns contributed to this report.","NEW: Miriam Carey was diagnosed with postpartum psychosis, her sister says .

"(CNN) -- Which came first, the troubles or the fame? After the suicide of a former contestant on Gordon Ramsay's ""Kitchen Nightmares,"" the spotlight shined bright on the issues of reality TV stars. New Jersey restaurant owner Joseph Cerniglia plunged into New York's Hudson River in September 2010, and the New York City medical examiner ruled the death a suicide. Cerniglia had appeared on the first season of the Fox reality show hosted by famed chef Ramsay. At the time the episode was taped in 2007, Cerniglia was facing financial issues stemming from his then-struggling restaurant. Ramsay offered advice on how to turn his business around, telling the chef, ""Your business is about to f**king swim down the Hudson."" Ramsay released a statement following Cerniglia's death. ""I was fortunate to spend time with Joe during the first season of 'Kitchen Nightmares,' "" Ramsay said. ""Joe was a brilliant chef, and our thoughts go out to his family, friends and staff."" Cerniglia's death once again raised the specter of suicide in connection with reality television. ""I absolutely don't feel that everyone who appears on a reality show is a damaged person,"" said Sharon Waxman, founder of entertainment site The Wrap, which in 2009 examined the suicides of 11 people connected to reality shows. ""I'm just saying that there's probably a higher percentage than in the normal population who are attracted to that and who might have some vulnerabilities that will be exploited by being on television."" There have been several cases, including Najai Turpin, a boxer who killed himself in 2005 after participating in the reality show ""The Contender,"" hosted by Sylvester Stallone and Sugar Ray Leonard. In 2008, a one-time ""American Idol"" auditioner, Paula Goodspeed, was found dead of an overdose near the home of one of the show's judges, Paula Abdul. Abdul later said that Goodspeed had been obsessed with her for several years and that she had begged producers not to allow Goodspeed to audition. The Fox network declined to comment on Goodspeed's death, but former ""Idol"" producer Nigel Lythgoe told People magazine he had no recollection of Abdul requesting that Goodspeed not be allowed on the show. Rachel Brown, a 2006 contestant on ""Hell's Kitchen,"" which is also hosted by Ramsay, was found dead of a gunshot wound in her Dallas home in 2007. A representative of the Tarrant County medical examiner's office confirmed to CNN that Brown's death was ruled a suicide. Princess Banton-Lofters is a development producer who has worked on casting several reality shows, including ""The Real Housewives of Atlanta."" She said she has seen the process morph over the years. ""I know that when I am casting, I am looking for that person who is going to shine,"" Banton-Lofters said. ""That could be shining in personality, shining in lifestyle or shining in just their story. But I think it's definitely changed in that (casting professionals) are probably now looking for a little bit more of the crazy."" But with so many people these days pursing the limelight via reality shows, is the number of troubled contestants just an expected statistic? Celebrity and fame expert Cooper Lawrence said that may be, though she pointed to a 2006 study authored by Dr. Drew Pinsky (host of HLN's Dr. Drew On Call"" and former VH1 reality shows ""Celebrity Rehab"" and ""Sober House"") and S. Mark Young as evidence that reality television attracts a specific type of personality. In the study, published in the Journal of Research in Personality, celebrities including television stars, comedians, musicians and reality stars were given the Narcissistic Personality Inventory. ""The numbers for the reality stars were off the charts,"" Lawrence said. ""It makes sense, because you are not an actor playing a role, you're not a musician hiding behind a guitar, you're you. The level of narcissism for reality stars is documented and goes well beyond the normal population."" And while narcissism isn't an indicator for suicide, Cooper said it can be an indicator of a troubled person who lacks the stability to deal with the dark side of notoriety. ""Reality television has provided an outlet for narcissistic individuals, many with limited abilities, to believe that they can succeed in the entertainment industry,"" the study said. ""This desire to enter the industry may be fueled by the types of fantasy feelings of success, power and glory that narcissists seem to exhibit."" Dr. Paula Clayton, who in 2010 was medical director for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, said that there is no data that definitively link reality television with an increased probability of suicide but that a mental disorder like narcissism could make a person more prone to taking his own life. ""Ninety percent of people who kill themselves have a mental disorder when they kill themselves, the most common one being depression,"" she said. ""There are all of these background factors that are the most important, and these reality shows and whatever happens might be the final straw."" The Wrap's Waxman said their series on reality show suicides sought to examine whether the sometimes brutal nature of appearing on reality shows with all that entails, including public scrutiny, was a cause or whether such shows simply attract troubled individuals. Waxman said the debate rages on. ""I think the experts will tell you that both are factors,"" she said. ""To some degree, there are people who are needy in some way who are looking for fame for some particular reason to fill some need that they have which makes them particularly vulnerable."" ""But also the experience of being on television exposed in that way and often seeing themselves on television being 'Franken-edited' or what they call 'Franken-bytes,' where they edit a sequence together just to heighten the drama of every scene, is sometimes really mortifying for people, and they're really not prepared for that."" Blogger Kath Skerry, who runs GiveMeMyRemote.com, said she worries that those who are focused on the fame that reality TV brings may not be mentally or emotionally prepared for the downside. ""If you fail on reality TV, you're failing in a very big way,"" she said. ""In a way that is seen by millions and millions of people, and to have that level of vulnerability exposed can raise the dramatic stakes of your situation."" For help please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline or call 1-800-273-8255 and they will put you in touch with someone in your area.","The suicide of ""MasterChef"" runner-up is the latest involving reality TV .

"(CNN) -- The Indian city of Mumbai exploded into chaos early Thursday morning as gunmen launched a series of attacks across the country's commercial capital, killing scores of people and taking hostages in two luxury hotels frequented by Westerners. Deepak Chopra says extremists could be reacting to Barack Obama's gestures toward Muslims. CNN's Larry King spoke with author Deepak Chopra about the situation. Larry King: Let's go to Dr. Deepak Chopra, the physician, philosopher. His new book is ""Jesus: A Story of Enlightenment."" Where were you born in India, Deepak? Deepak Chopra: I was born in Delhi, but I have been in these hotels many, many times. I have stayed there, so I know the scene; I know the restaurants. I have been trying to get in touch with my friends and relatives, some of whom I have spoken to, some of whom I can't speak to. The lines are jammed. We're texting each other. A friend of mine from Egypt was in the restaurant at the Taj hotel when the firing started, and somehow she managed to avoid the fray, hid in a basement and is now holed up in a room which is right next to the Taj hotel and is waiting to be told what to do. The situation is complex, Larry, because it could inflame to proportions that we cannot even imagine. It has to be contained. We now recognize that this is a global problem, with only a global effort can solve this. And you know, one of the things that I think is happening is that these militant terrorist groups are actually terrified that [President-elect Barack] Obama's gestures to the rest of the Muslim world may actually overturn the tables on them by alienating them from the rest of the Muslim world, so they're reacting to this. You know, this is Obama's opportunity to actually harness the help of the Muslims. You know, there's 1.8 billion Muslims in the world. That's 25 percent of the population of the world. It's the fastest-growing religion in the world. We cannot, if we do not appease and actually recruit the help of this Muslim world, we're going to have a problem on our hands. And we cannot go after the wrong people, as we did after 9/11, because then the whole collateral damage that occurs actually aggravates the situation. In India, this is particularly inflammatory, because there's a rise of Hindu fundamentalism. We saw what that did in Gujarat, where, you know, Muslims were scorched and they were killed, and there was almost a genocide of the Muslims. India has 150 million Muslims. That's more Muslims in India than in Pakistan. So this is an opportunity right now for India and Pakistan to recognize this is their common problem. It's not a Muslim problem right now; it's a global problem. ... King: Do you think that this is just the beginning, that there's a potential impact, or more? Chopra: There is a potential impact of a lot more carnage. But it can be contained. And right now, one of the questions, you know, after I heard Barbara Starr talking about how coordinated this is, that there are militant groups that cross international boundaries, is who is financing this? Where is the money coming from? We have to ask very serious, honest questions. What role do we have in this? Are our petrodollars funding both sides of this war on terrorism? Why are we not asking the Saudis where that money is going that we give them? Is it going through this supply chain to Pakistan? It's not enough for Pakistan to condemn it. Pakistan should cooperate with India in uprooting this. They should be part of the surgery that is going to happen. It's not enough for Indians to blame Pakistanis. Indians should actually ask the Pakistanis to help them. And it's not enough for us to worry about Westerners being killed and Americans being killed. Every life is precious over there. We have got to get rid of this idea that this is an American problem or a Western problem. It's a global problem, and we need a global solution, and we need the help of all the Muslims, 25 percent of the world's population, to help us uproot this problem. King: What does India immediately do? Chopra: India at this moment has to contain any reactive violence from the fundamentalist Hindus, which is very likely and possible. So India has to condemn that by not blaming local Muslims. They have to identify the exact groups. And the world has to be very careful that they don't go after the wrong people. Because if you go after the wrong people, you convert moderates into extremists. It happens every time, and retribution against innocent people just because they have the same religion actually aggravates and perpetuates the problem. King: Are you pessimistic? Chopra: I think Mr. Obama has a real opportunity here, but a challenging opportunity, a creative opportunity. Get rid of the phrase ""war on terrorism."" Ask for a creative solution in which we all participate. King: Is it because the war on terrorism really can never be won because the terrorists (inaudible)? Chopra: Because it's an oxymoron. It's an oxymoron, Larry, a war on war, a war on terrorism. You know, terrorists call mechanized death from 35,000 feet above sea level with a press of a button also terror. We don't call it that, because our soldiers are wearing uniforms. They don't see what is happening, and innocent people are being killed. So, you know, terror is a term that you apply to the other. King: Thanks, Deepak Chopra, as always, extraordinarily enlightening.","""This is a global problem,"" author Deepak Chopra says .
Barack Obama must use chance to get Muslims' help, he says .
Officials must not go after the wrong people, Chopra says ."
"(CNN) -- A nationwide sweep by federal agents targeting the violent MS-13 street gang has resulted in hundreds of arrests, including 263 gang members, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency announced Friday. Those arrested in the July and early August sweep include suspects wanted on murder, assault, sexual assault, robbery and kidnapping charges, among other offenses, ICE said in a news release. Among those charged are 158 members and associates of MS-13, with 105 others allegedly belonging to other gangs. Authorities arrested 84 non-gang members wanted on criminal charges and 14 people on immigration violations as part of the same sweep, according to the federal agency. Murder suspect who is a member of MS-13 arrested . Special agents with ICE's Homeland Security Investigations unit also seized 28 firearms, 10 kilograms of marijuana, 123 grams of cocaine, over 770 grams of heroin and about $22,400 in cash. Agency officials describe MS-13 -- also known by the name Mara Salvatrucha -- as ""one of the most dangerous transnational criminal gangs in the world today."" Salvadoran immigrants fleeing that nation's civil war started MS-13 some years ago in Los Angeles. MS-13 leader gets 76 years . Since then, the group has grown to about 10,000 members -- most of them Central and South American immigrants -- operating in largely independent chapters across 42 states, according to the FBI. Authorities allege MS-13 members engage in various criminal activities, including drug trafficking, murder, rape, robbery and other crimes. And MS-13 extends well beyond the United States, which is why many efforts to combat it have spanned borders. In 2005, for instance, a two-day operation involving more than 6,400 government agents in the United States, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico led to 660 arrests. Some 237 of those arrests were in El Salvador, with 73 in the United States. Massive international sting nets 660 . And last October, President Barack Obama's administration named the organization a transnational criminal enterprise, with the goal of freezing millions of dollars in profits from drug and sex trafficking operations.

"(CNN) -- Over the past few weeks almost a third of all Americans headed back to classrooms -- from early learning centers to universities, as students and as teachers -- accompanied by the usual seasonal mix of joys and jitters. Or perhaps not. Lately it seems we've been inundated with bad news: The nation's report card is crummy; schools are broke and failing; graduates can't find jobs. And with competition for resources putting increased pressure on standardized test scores, cheating scandals have become practically ho-hum. Among all these headlines resides a more quietly sobering fact: This year's high school graduates will be the first educated entirely under the No Child Left Behind Act. In other words, a whole generation of kids who've grown up with an emphasis on multiple choice testing, who've been taught that knowing the one right answer is more important than the process of inquiry, who've learned that admitting ""I don't know"" is a crime. But the problem isn't simply with a narrowly conceived educational policy. Pressure to know the right answer (or, more precisely, to appear to know) isn't limited to the classroom. It's pervasive throughout our culture -- a reality at once daunting and hopeful. Daunting because it means real reform will require more widespread change. Hopeful because it means there's something every one of us can do about it. Maybe even starting today. I'm talking about breaking the habit of faking knowledge in order to save face. For most of us, the fear of not knowing -- of looking dumb -- gets ingrained when we're small and reinforced throughout life in ways both subtle and overt. For every time someone reassured us, ""There's no such thing as a stupid question,"" weren't there ample experiences -- on the playground, at the dinner table, and yes, in the classroom -- that convinced us otherwise? Anyone who's ever been reprimanded or ridiculed for revealing ignorance knows all too well: The taste of shame is bitter and lingering. We'll go to great lengths to avoid it, often without deliberate thought. How many times have I found myself nodding in feigned recognition when someone makes reference to a person or book they assume I know? How many times have I been guilty of unwittingly inflicting similar discomfort on others? In some walks of life, presenting a knowing demeanor is practically a job requirement. One financial adviser recalls how, early in his career, he was so anxious to impress upon his clients that he knew was he was doing, he'd use meetings to ""information dump"" -- only subsequently learning that they'd been too embarrassed to speak up and confess they had no idea what he was talking about. A surgeon tells about the time when, as a new intern, afraid to admit unfamiliarity with a procedure and ask questions, she plunged in confidently -- and made an incision four times longer than the patient had been told the scar would be. Politicians routinely face shame if they confess to not knowing. Remember Rick Perry's memory lapse during the 2011 Republican primary debate? It seems we'll forgive our elected officials just about any breach of ethics, but let them admit to anything less than invulnerable certainty and they can kiss our vote goodbye. For the past several years, I've made a conscious effort to be candid about the limits of my own knowledge. As a college teacher, I've discussed this intention explicitly with students and colleagues. Guess what? I'm mortified to report: Despite my public resolution to practice this most essential form of academic integrity, I still catch myself engaging in a kind of knee-jerk, face-saving, passive dissimulation on a semi-regular basis. Based on what I hear from others, I'm not alone. Such behavior is apparently endemic. So what are we to do? For starters, talk about it. Own up to instances when we faked knowledge. Initiate conversations about what makes us more or less susceptible to this behavior. You're likely to hear some funny stories, and the experience of shared vulnerability is humanizing and makes for closer connections. Best of all, it creates an environment in which all stand to grow. My friend Lori, during her years as a high school history teacher, constantly encouraged her students to play in the wide-open spaces of uncertainty. One way she did this was by sharing her own gaps in knowledge. She'd model not just her comfort with not having figured everything out, but her delight in it. This, she seemed to convey, was where real intellectual pleasure lay: in the adventure of exploring the unknown. Often she'd assign Shakespeare as a way of getting students to think about power and status. She'd have them read one of the plays, then ask: ""Who's more powerful in this scene?"" Her students, anxious to deliver the ""right"" answer, would demand clarification. ""What do you mean? Powerful how?"" Lori would shrug and unfurl her fingers: Nothing up my sleeves. This isn't a trick. If her students protested, she'd say simply, ""That's all I know."" And so they'd be forced to grapple not only with the answer to her question, but with the meaning of her question, with the definition of power in the first place, which she, the authority figure, had just handed over to them: You guys figure it out. You decide. In this way, they were learning about history and drama but also about shifts in power, and who may wield it, and how classrooms can work and how societies can work, and about the very nature of ""right"" answers as opposed to the illimitable richness of interrogating the questions. This is what excites me when I think of heading back to school this fall: the prospect of bringing such generous, generative energy into the classroom. Perhaps filling in the ovals with number two pencils is important for helping us understand how far we are from achieving equity in schools across the nation. That is a vital project, deserving urgent attention. But we won't ever achieve equity -- let alone excellence -- if we don't also work to make our schools places where we all feel safe saying ""I don't know."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Leah Hager Cohen.","This year's high school grads will have been entirely taught under No Child Left Behind .
Leah Cohen: There's too much emphasis on memorizing the right answer rather than encouraging inquiry .
She says people are deathly afraid of admitting that they don't know something .
Cohen: Our fear of ignorance keeps us from learning as much as we should ."
"London (CNN) -- It is a guilty pleasure of anyone supposed to be working, and a time-waster that has kept millions of us up far too late at night. Viral videos -- from pop videos to advertising, parodies to accidental hits -- have been entertaining, and occasionally informing, us like never before in 2012. Here is CNN's selection of some of the top viral videos this year. Most watched viral video of all time: Psy: 'Gangnam Style' YouTube views at time of writing: 826 million . Published: July .

Best Gangnam parody: Mitt Romney Style . YouTube views at time of writing: 23.8 million . Published: October . What's the big deal: ""Gangnam Style"" has been copied and parodied so many times that we felt the tributes were worth a category in their own right. The parodies range from a ""The Lord of the Rings""-themed ""Gandalf Style"" to ""London Style"" to ""Kim Jong Style"" parodying North Korea's leader. Our favorite is ""Mitt Romney Style,"" by New York-based CollegeHumor.com, making fun of the Republican governor and failed presidential candidate's wealth and swagger. Best advertisement: A Dramatic Surprise on a Quiet Square . YouTube views at time of writing: 38.8 million . Published: April . What's the big deal: In this advertisement for the launch of the television channel TNT in Belgium, the company placed a big red button in the main square of a small Belgian town with a sign saying ""Push to add drama."" The ensuing chain of events -- and the crowds' reaction -- when a passing cyclist presses the button, makes compelling viewing. CNN and TNT are both Time Warner companies. Most-watched documentary: KONY 2012 . YouTube views at time of writing: 94 million . Published: March . What's the big deal: Rarely has a campaign video gained such a reaction. This video by the San Diego-based campaign group Invisible Children about the African warlord Joseph Kony gained 74 million views within a week of its release in March. More: Violent warlord video goes viral . Kony has operated in central Africa for two decades and is wanted for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court.

Best marriage proposal: Isaac's Live Lip-Dub Proposal . YouTube views at time of writing: 16.3 million views . Published: May . What's the big deal: This makes a change from the schmaltz you might expect from a public marriage proposal, as actor Isaac Lamb organized this intricately choreographed live performance with 60 friends miming to the Bruno Mars song ""Marry You."" As Lamb wrote in the YouTube blurb: ""I told my girlfriend to meet me at my parent's house for dinner. ""When she arrived I had stationed my brother to sit her in the back of an open Honda CRV and give her some headphones. He 'wanted to play her a song' ... What she got instead was the world's first Live Lip-Dub Proposal."" Best mis-hap: Catch the Ice Dude . YouTube views at time of writing: 21.3 million . Published: September .

Published: October . What's the big deal: A woman who has become known as Donna the Deer Lady calls a local radio station in Fargo, North Dakota, complaining that deer crossings are encouraging deer to cross busy roads. ""Why are we encouraging deer to cross at the interstate?"" she asks. The presenter makes a brief attempt to explain that deer crossing signs are to warn motorists of areas with large deer population, rather than for the benefit of the deer, before giving up and agreeing to publicize her concerns. Best public service broadcast: Dumb Ways to Die . YouTube views at time of writing: 25.3 million . Published: November . What's the big deal: This was created by the Melbourne Metro as a reminder that getting hit by a train is the dumbest way to die.

Best corporate comebac: Bodyform Responds: The Truth . YouTube views at time of writing: 3.4 million . Published: October . What's the big deal: This video came after a man called Richard Neill posted an amusing rant on the Facebook page of sanitary towel manufacturer Bodyform complaining that their advertisements showing happy women taking part in extreme sports during their periods were misleading. The company responded with a mock contrite apology video, supposedly from its managing director (although actually an actress) that they had lied to him about periods. The technology site Mashable wrote of Bodyform's video: ""This may be the best response ever to a Facebook rant -- period.""","""Gangnam Style"" became the most watched YouTube video of all time, overtaking Justin Bieber .
The rap -- named after a neighborhood of Seoul -- spawned countless parodies .

"(CNN) -- IFA, one of Europe's largest consumer electronics exhibitions kicked off this week in Berlin. With manufacturing giants such as Samsung, Sony and LG all rumored to be launching new products at the show, CNN asked Stephen Graves, online editor at Stuff magazine, to select five of his favorite gadgets from the exhibition floor. Sony Xperia Z1 . Sony's new flagship smartphone features an amazing 20.7MP camera, plus an even tougher and more water-resistant frame than its predecessor the Xperia Z. Inside, the Xperia Z1 has a more powerful quad-core processor and a whopping 3000mAh battery -- and with a razor-sharp 5in full HD screen, it's shaping up to be yet another top class Android phone. Stuff's Will Dunn says: ""Although it's not a comprehensive overhaul of Sony's flagship phone, the Xperia Z1 does offer several incremental improvements."" Read more: Xperia Z1 review . Panasonic Toughpad 4K UT-MB5 . Panasonic has managed a world first with this 4K-compatible tablet, which features an incredibly sharp 3840 x 2560 pixel screen. At 20 inches in size, it's around four times bigger than an iPad and manages only two hours of battery life, so portable it isn't -- but this Windows 8-powered beast is certainly something to behold. Don't expect to spot many in the wild though -- the â‚¬4,500 price tag will be hard for even the most ardent early adopter to stomach. Samsung Galaxy Gear and Galaxy Note 3 . Samsung put on a huge press conference to announce a handful of new products, but the Korean giant is clearly banking on them being blockbuster hits. The Galaxy Note 3 is the third-generation of the Note ""phablet"" (bigger than a smartphone, smaller than a tablet). With a 1920 x 1080 5.7in screen, eight-core processor, 13MP camera with 3x optical zoom and a swanky stitched leather back panel, it's looking set to be one of the most powerful, versatile mobile devices on the market. Read more: Galaxy Note 3 review . The Galaxy Gear is something entirely new for Samsung. It's an Android-powered smartwatch that maintains a link to your Samsung Galaxy phone to deliver notifications, control music playback and access apps. Read more: Samsung Galaxy Gear review . 3Doodler . A 3D printer that you hold in your hand like a pen, the Kickstarter-funded 3Doodler is undoubtedly one of the coolest breakout oddities of IFA 2013. The size of a Cuban cigar, it extrudes hot, quick-setting plastic from its nozzle nib, allowing you to ""sketch"" out small 3D models in minutes. It's much faster than using a traditional 3D printer -- and doesn't require any software to boot. Read more: 3Doodler review .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- An Indian court in the western state of Gujarat has convicted 31 of the 94 people charged with conspiracy and murder for setting fire to a passenger train in 2002 which triggered widespread religious violence, resulting in the death of more than 1,000 people. Sixty-three of the accused, including one of the main conspirators, were acquitted Tuesday due to lack of evidence, prosecutors said. A suspected Muslim mob attacked the Sabarmati Express near the town of Godhra on 27 February, 2002, killing more than 50 people, most of whom were Hindu pilgrims. The Hindu pilgrims were returning from the north Indian town of Ayodhya where they had been demanding that the government build a temple on the ruins of a 16th century mosque. The train fire sparked days of rioting in which more than a thousand people, mostly Muslims, were killed. The cause of the train fire has long been disputed. Special security arrangements were made throughout the state ahead of the sensitive verdict to maintain peace. Indian authorities have also imposed restrictions on broadcasting video or photographs of the original carnage on the day of the verdict. So far, no violence has been reported following the verdict.","63 others are acquitted because of lack of evidence .

"(CNN) -- The board of Jamaica's Anti-Doping Commission (JADCO) resigned after several of the Caribbean nation's sprinters were caught cheating earlier this year and a former head of the body highlighted a lack of testing. Jamaica's minister responsible for sport, Natalie Neita Headley, announced the news while also saying her country vowed to step up the fight against drug cheats. The resignations take effect at the end of 2013. ""Quite recently, JADCO's commissioners met and acknowledged that there is a public perception of the existence of conflicts of interests among some of the members of the commission,"" Headley said in a statement posted on the website of the Office of the Prime Minister. Even though Jamaicans Usain Bolt and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce were named male and female athletes of the year, respectively, by track and field's governing body last week, ex world-record holder Asafa Powell and Sherone Simpson made the wrong type of headlines when they admitted to testing positive for banned substances in July. Three-time Olympic gold medalist Veronica Campbell-Brown tested positive, too, although she was cleared to return by officials in Jamaica who deemed she didn't intend to enhance performance through taking a banned diuretic. Members of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) examined JADCO's operations last month and Headley said Jamaica would give its ""full support"" to stiffer revisions to the WADA code expected to come into play in 2015. In August, Renee Anne Shirley -- the former executive director of JADCO -- told Sports Illustrated that JADCO conducted a mere one out-of-competition test from March to July 2012, the months leading into the summer Olympics in London. ""At no time has WADA ever deemed Jamaica or JADCO to be non-compliant,"" Headley said. ""At no time has WADA threatened to bar Jamaica or Jamaican athletes from participating in any international event â€” Olympic Games, World Championship or the like. ""As we continue to build on this rich sporting legacy, the Government of Jamaica will continue to do whatever it can to protect our good name and reputation and in the maintenance of a doping-free sporting environment.""","The entire board of the under-fire Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission resigns .

"(CNN) -- Juventus were left searching for answers after their unbeaten run was shattered by Fiorentina. The home side staged a renaissance in Florence that the city's medieval residents would have been proud of as they turned a 2-0 half time deficit into a 4-2 triumph. It was the first loss of the season for Italy's Serie A champions, Juventus. ""We lost a game that we dominated for 70 minutes,"" Juve manager Antonio Conte said on the club's website. ""We were home and dry and had more than one opportunity to score the third goal. ""Suddenly something strange happened, if I could explain why it would be simple."" Juventus defender Andrea Barzagli was equally baffled: ""I honestly don't know how to explain what just happened. ""We dominated the game, going close to scoring a third goal, and before we know it we find ourselves 3-2 down. There weren't even signs of a potential Fiorentina comeback."" A first half penalty for Carlos Tevez, who had been brought down by fellow Argentine Gonzalo Rodriguez, and a Paul Pogba strike had given Juventus the lead. Fiorentina's revival began in the 66th minute when Giuseppe Rossi slotted in a penalty. The American born striker found the back of the net 10 minutes later as he drove the ball beyond Juventus keeper Gianluigi Buffon. Joaquin caught the away side on the break to add a third for Fiorentina before Rossi wrapped up his hat trick in a stunning 14-minute spell. Fiorentina coach Vincenzo Montella said: ""This is the best result ever. It's difficult to score against Juve so putting four past them gives us immense satisfaction."" The result saw Juventus drop to third in the table behind Roma and Napoli while Fiorentina are sixth behind Inter Milan. The Milan side were held to a 3-3 draw by Torino in a dramatic match which saw goalkeeper Samir Handanovic sent off after just six minutes. Handanovic was shown the red card after he was judged to have brought down Torino striker Alessio Cerci. Inter were playing their first match since Indonesian tycoon Erick Thohir bought a 70% share in the club. A win looked to be on the cards only for Torino's Nicola Bellomo to curl a free kick into the net in the dying moments of the match. Monaco held by Sochaux . In France, Monaco also threw away a 2-0 lead to settle for a 2-2 draw away at Sochaux. Belgian Yannick Ferreira Carrasco had fired the Principality side into the lead inside the opening 10 minutes. But Sochaux refused to give up and second half goals from Cedric Bakambu and Joseph Loppy rescued a share of the points. ""I spoke a lot this week about the psychological aspect and after ten minutes I was thinking that was all for nothing,"" said Sochaux manager Herve Renard. ""But in football you should never give up, and it was a great reaction."" Monaco coach Claudio Ranieri said his side ""left our concentration in the dressing room"" at the break. The result saw Monaco fall two points behind league leaders Paris Saint-Germain. The French champions had beaten Bastia 4-0 Saturday, a result that included a dazzling back heel from Zlatan Ibrahimovic that has been dubbed a ""scorpion"" strike.","Juventus stunned by 4-2 defeat at Fiorentina .

"(CNN) -- Months after sexting revelations dashed Anthony Weiner's hopes of election in New York, a mayor on the other side of the world is battling for political survival following a lurid sex scandal that has electrified the usually sleepy world of local politics. The crisis engulfing Len Brown, the recently re-elected mayor of Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, involves sex in the mayoral chambers, a former mistress who says she also shared a bed with an adviser to his rival, intrigue as to whether the mayor was victim of a political smear campaign, and a hunt for the sender of a mystery text message that triggered the revelations. The scandal, broken by a blogger and virtually unprecedented in New Zealand politics in its sleaziness, has raised fears it could herald a grubby new era in which the sex lives of politicians, traditionally seen as beyond the purview of the media, become fair game. ""In the past, it was the case that sexuality and what politicians did in their own private lives was deemed to be non-political, and not generally reported upon,"" said Bryce Edwards, political scientist at the University of Otago. ""That has definitely changed. I think this story will shift the goalposts more than any other to give the green light to political insiders to think you can air the dirty laundry of politicians."" The scandal has left Brown, a 57-year-old married father-of-three, publicly humiliated, facing a council inquiry as to whether he breached codes of conduct, and weathering mounting calls for him to resign the mayoralty to which he was re-elected only days before the scandal broke. For her part, the former mistress who exposed his infidelity -- Bevan Chuang, who sat on a council advisory panel and was an unsuccessful local board candidate at the recent elections -- says she now regrets her actions in outing the center-left mayor, and has turned on those she claims pressured her into doing so. Neither Brown and Chuang responded to repeated requests from CNN for comment. However, in a post on her Facebook page, the 32 year old fired shots at the blogger who published her account, and at Luigi Wewege, an adviser to Brown's main rival for the mayoralty, with whom she says she also had an intimate relationship. ""I have been foolish, but I feel used, abused and manipulated by people I thought were friends who have been taking snippets of what I have said to advance their own political agendas and muck-raking,"" she wrote. While the Facebook post has been taken down, Chuang expressed similar sentiments in an interview she gave to the New Zealand Herald newspaper. Wewege, for his part, has denied that he was romantically involved with Chuang. ""Nobody's come out of this with any credit,"" said Dick Quax, an Auckland city councilor who is a long-time rival of Brown's. ""But the person who has come out with the least is the mayor."" The scandal broke Tuesday when right-leaning political blog Whale Oil, run by Cameron Slater, published an anonymous account of a woman who said she had had a two-year affair with the mayor after he had pursued her following a council function. Newspapers followed the story, soon identifying Chuang as the woman in the account, which included salacious claims that the pair had liaisons on council time and council premises, including once being caught in flagrante by a security guard in the town hall. Slater subsequently confirmed that Chuang was the woman in the story. Brown appeared on the television show Campbell Live to confirm he had had an affair, requesting privacy to resolve issues with his family. He said he had no intention to resign, and that the exposure of the affair reflected a ""clear will or determination to try and force a resignation, to try and in effect destroy me."" Pressure mounted further on the mayor after the Herald reported -- and the mayor's office later confirmed -- that Brown had written a reference that helped secure his lover a job at the city art gallery, a council subsidiary. The council then announced that it was opening an inquiry into the matter to determine whether Brown used council funds in the relationship and whether any aspect of his behavior contravened the council's code of ethics. Brown had stated in his Campbell Live interview that no inappropriate spending of council funds took place. But the story took a turn after Chuang, having denied her revelations were politically motivated, told the Herald that she had been pressured into speaking to the blogger by Wewege, with whom she said she had had an intimate relationship. Saying her world had begun ""falling apart"" after she missed out on a board seat in the elections, she told the newspaper she regretted going public and now wanted to apologize to the mayor. The newspaper published social media exchanges provided by Chuang that appeared to back up her claims of a relationship between her and Wewege, and of his encouragement for her to gather evidence on Brown. CNN was unable to independently confirm the authenticity of those exchanges. Wewege had been an advisor to John Palino, the center-right mayoral candidate who had polled second in the election; John Slater, father of blogger Cameron, had also been a key adviser to his campaign. Wewege denied to the New Zealand Herald that he had been in a relationship with Chuang, while Palino denied any previous knowledge of a relationship between his staffer and Chuang to the newspaper. Neither Wewege nor Palino responded to CNN's requests for comment. Speaking to CNN, the blogger Cameron Slater said he was not part of an organized center-right push to smear the mayor, and denied exploiting his source. The story had only come about after he was approached by Wewege and Chuang with texts that they said would embarrass the mayor. He said Chuang initially had cold feet about going through with the article, but decided to proceed after receiving a text message from an anonymous number, warning her not to proceed. The identity of the sender is now a key question at the heart of the affair. ""Whoever sent that text message brought the whole thing to a head,"" he said. Slater said he had chosen to proceed with the story as the issues of ethics, integrity and potential abuse of power it raised made it a ""clear public interest issue."" ""It's not about presenting the lurid details of an affair,"" he said. ""You've got the second most powerful politician in NZ... controlling the largest city, billions of dollars in ratepayers' money and answerable to no one except the public."" He was happy if blogging about the private lives of politicians helped bring about greater integrity, he said. ""In the UK these things are reported as a matter of course. It happens in Australia and the U.S. as well -- look at the Weiner case. New Zealand for too long has sat in a cozy arrangement because the politicians and the media are too close. There has been a mutually assured destruction mentality that doesn't provide well for democracy."" He believed the traditional media would have broken the story too if it had the scoop. ""Everyone's being sanctimonious and pointing the finger at this nasty blogger who has breached all these protocols. Well you know what? Those protocols don't actually exist. There's no rules,"" he said. ""The evidence they would have done it, is that the next day the largest daily in the country splashed five pages on this scandal."" Academic Bryce Edwards said it was hard to assess whether the story was a case of legitimate ""public interest or just something the public have an interest in."" ""It's pretty hard to see which category it falls into. At the start it did seem more prurient, but each revelation seems to shift the story more into the political sphere."" Local politics was traditionally viewed as low-stakes and boring, but the 2010 amalgamation of Auckland's seven existing city and district councils into one ""super city"" had given the new ""super mayor"" unprecedented powers that made him a more attractive scalp for his enemies. With unscientific polls in New Zealand media roughly split between those who believed the mayor should stay and those who said he should go, it was hard to call what the politician's fate would be. ""At this stage it's looking more likely than not that he's going to have to do something -- either resign or put himself up for re-election,"" he said.","Observers fear a sex scandal in New Zealand local politics could usher in a new era of sleaze .

"Bristol, Rhode Island (CNN) -- The Willcox family has long been accustomed to prolonged absences from their seafaring patriarch. In fact, run-ins with the law were not unusual, given the fact that Peter Willcox had spent decades working for the environmental activist group Greenpeace, which is well-known for its provocative, headline-grabbing protests. But no one expected the 60-year-old mariner to end up languishing in a Russian jail in the Arctic, facing up to 15 years in prison on charges of piracy. ""The situation he's in now is just way too extreme,"" said his wife, Maggy. She and other members of the Willcox family spoke to CNN in their first media interviews since Russian authorities arrested 30 passengers and crew members aboard the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise last month. ""The activists have found themselves embroiled in something that has larger implications,"" added Maggy Willcox. She married Willcox, the captain of the Arctic Sunrise, in February after the two had been friends for decades. ""He's a very sweet, sweet man, and yet he's this stalwart person in the face of any kind of crisis like what's going on now,"" said the newlywed. Willcox, a native of Norwalk, Connecticut, is the sole American citizen in a group of activists Greenpeace is now calling the ""Arctic 30."" The 30 detainees include volunteers and crew members from South America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand as well as a Russian freelance photographer and ship cooks from Turkey and Ukraine. What happened in the Arctic Ocean . On September 18, two Greenpeace activists from the Arctic Sunrise attempted to scale an oil rig operated by the Russian energy Gazprom. They were planning to protest against Gazprom's plans to drill for oil in the Arctic Ocean. The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation later released an unedited video showing the tense stand-off that ensued. Two inflatable rafts operated by mask-wearing Russian security forces approached the platform. One Russian officer seized the rope an activist was using to try to climb the looming walls of the platform. Two other inflatable rafts from Greenpeace bobbed near by, periodically being drenched by water cannons fired from the oil platform. Greenpeace disputes Russia's claim it found drugs on ship . At one point, someone from above fired a series of shots into the water that struck perilously close to Greenpeace boats and Russian security rafts. Greenpeace activists could be seen holding their hands up in the air as a Russian officer aimed his pistol at them. Russian security forces initially detained the two activists who had climbed onto the oil rig. Later, they commandeered the Arctic Sunrise and towed it to the Russian port of Murmansk. There, Russian prosecutors pressed charges against all 30 of the detainees. Willcox's 18-year-old daughter, Natasha, learned about her father's arrest during her first weeks as a student at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island. ""I would ask [the Russians] to open a dictionary and read the definition of piracy,"" she said. ""They tried to board an oil rig. They didn't try to hurt anyone. They didn't have weapons,"" she added. According to the International Convention on the Law of the Sea, the definition of piracy is ""any illegal acts of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for private ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft."" Russia's president seems to agree that the charges of piracy don't match the crime. Speaking to journalists at an international summit on the Arctic last month, Vladimir Putin said ""it is absolutely evident that they are, of course, not pirates."" But, he added, ""formally they were trying to seize that platform."" A court in Murmansk has denied bail to the Arctic 30. On Thursday, 11 Nobel Peace Prize winners wrote a letter to Putin, calling on the Kremlin to ""reaffirm the right to nonviolent protest"" and drop the ""excessive charges of piracy"" against the activists. A legacy of peaceful protesting . Peaceful protest has long been a way of life in the Willcox family. Willcox's 91-year old father, Roger, campaigned against discrimination against Jewish students while studying at Harvard University. In 1949, the senior Willcox founded an interracial housing cooperative in Norwalk, aimed at creating a community with ""no discrimination because of race, color, creed or politics."" The younger Willcox was only 12 when his father brought him from Connecticut to the Deep South to participate in civil rights marches. Peter ""often said that if he wasn't arrested by the time he was 21, he'd be a great disappointment to his family,"" recalled Maggy Willcox. By the time he was a teenager, Willcox was working as a crew member aboard the Clearwater, a sailing ship from which the folk singer Pete Seeger campaigned against pollution on the Hudson River. ""The logical next move was Greenpeace,"" Roger Willcox said. In 1985, Peter was the captain of the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior when two explosions ripped through its hull while it was anchored in the port of Auckland in New Zealand. The ship sank, killing one passenger on board, Dutch photographer Fernando Pereira. A subsequent investigation by New Zealand authorities revealed French intelligence agents planted bombs on the ship. The deadly act of sabotage was apparently aimed at preventing Greenpeace from protesting against French nuclear tests in French Polynesia. Natasha Willcox said her father believed ""there's a lot of people out there that kind of need to be woken up and given a little push ... 'Hey, this is what's really happening and this is what we need to do to slow it down.' "" But his wife said Willcox showed some uncharacteristic reluctance before departing for the latest Greenpeace mission in the Arctic. By the time he was in the region, however, that hesitation appeared to have faded. The last postcard he sent to Maggy Willcox during a short stopover in Norway included an ominous final sentence: ""It will be a pretty cool action if the Russians have a sence [sic] of humor. Love you tons, P."" Greenpeace vigil for 'Arctic 30' held in Russia .","Peter Willcox is one of 30 Greenpeace activists being held in Russia .

"(CNN) -- The United States isn't leaving anything to chance. While it pursues a diplomatic solution to the Syria crisis by sending Secretary of State John Kerry to meet with his Russian counterpart in Geneva, Switzerland, on Thursday, it has also started arming the rebels. Two rebel groups, though, say the arms have yet to reach them. Meanwhile, a Vladimir Putin-penned editorial in The New York Times has at least one White House official saying it's an indication the Russian president is ""now fully invested in Syria's chemical disarmament."" And a U.N. report says that both sides -- the regime and the rebels -- have committed war crimes in Syria's bloody 2-year-old civil war. Here are the five things to pay attention to today. 1. Giving peace a chance . As the diplomatic focus shifts to Geneva, the talks get down to the nuts and bolts of how to identify, verify and ultimately destroy the Syrian regime's chemical weapons stockpile, a senior State Department official told CNN. Expect the sessions to last two or three days. A final deal may take much longer, but the State Department says the United States is looking for a ""credible and authentic way forward"" that is ""verifiable and that can happen expeditiously."" Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov have talked nine times since an August 21 chemical weapons attack in Syria that prompted the U.S. to urge military action against the regime. U.S., British and French diplomats also are hashing over similar matters in New York. A senior State Department official says the Syrian opposition is not pleased about recent developments. ""They're upset,"" the official says ""They don't trust this at all."" These are complicated matters with competing interests. Expect any final deal to go to the U.N. Security Council to be put into a formal resolution. And to add to the intrigue, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius says the U.N. report on last month's attack will probably be published Monday. And there will ""certainly be indications"" that the attack originated with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime, he said in a radio interview Thursday. Looming over the talks is the military strike card that President Barack Obama continues to hold. He asked Congress this week to put the authorization on hold, but the card isn't going back in the deck just yet. ""This is the way that diplomacy works,"" said former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who was America's top diplomat in the Clinton administration. ""You use the threat of the use of force to get some action in diplomacy, and then diplomacy just to figure out what you do about the threat of the use of force."" Still, some say it doesn't give the White House a lot of wiggle room. ""If diplomacy fails, he's painted himself into a corner,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina. ""The leader of the free world can't say all these things at the end of the day and do nothing."" 2. Rebels and their guns . These things don't happen quickly. It was back in June that officials familiar with the matter told CNN that the United States planned to send small arms, ammunition and, potentially, anti-tank weapons to Syria's rebels. Concerns about who the White House could trust kept the process on the slow track. But no more. Funded and organized by the CIA, the weapons began reaching moderate Syrian rebels two weeks ago, a U.S. official tells CNN. ""A coordinated effort is being made among the many supporters of the moderate opposition to get them the assistance they need,"" Kerry said during a Google+ Hangout discussion this week. Not so, opposition groups said Thursday. The Syrian National Coalition and the Free Syrian Army deny they have received weapons. ""We have some promises from the U.S. administration of shipment of weapons in a short period of time, but until now we have not received any,"" said Louay al-Mokdad, the Free Syrian Army political and media coordinator. We're waiting to see what the White House has to say about that. 3. Other government business . Obamacare. Government funding. An energy efficiency bill. Relieved of an impending vote on whether to give the president the authorization to attack Syria, Congress is moving on to other matters. Yet, Syria continues to bubble under the surface. ""Congress will be watching these negotiations very closely,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid warns. ""If there is any indication they're not serious or they're being used as a ploy to delay, then Congress stands ready to return"" to a resolution that would authorize a military strike on Syria. Whether the votes are there to approve such a resolution is another matter. But for now, there's a different deadline looming over Congress. If there's no spending plan by early October, there could be a government shutdown. 4. Pointing fingers . Finger-pointing is a popular pastime when the topic is Syria. The government blames the rebels. The rebels blame the government. The United Nations blames both. A U.N. report, released Wednesday, says that both sides have committed grave crimes in violation of international law. The U.N. Human Rights Council says government forces are committing crimes against humanity by attacking civilian populations. War crimes like murder, torture and hostage-taking are the charges against the opposition. ""There is no military solution to this conflict,"" the report says. ""Those who supply arms create but an illusion of victory."" Denials and more finger-pointing are likely from both sides. 5. Putin's turn . Obama got his say Tuesday. On Wednesday night, Putin took a stab at winning friends and influencing people in a piece published by The New York Times. In the op-ed, Putin says it's time ""to speak directly to the American people and their political leaders."" He challenges Obama across the board. He says striking Syria would kill innocent people, spread violence across the region and cloud other Middle East peace efforts. It would also ""unleash a new wave of terrorism."" He said skipping the United Nations to go it alone ""would constitute an act of aggression."" The sarin gas attack? That's in there too. While Obama squarely puts the blame for the alleged sarin attack on the Assad regime, Putin writes, ""There is every reason to believe it was used not by the Syrian army, but by opposition forces to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons, who would be siding with the fundamentalists."" Not a lot of middle ground as talks start in Geneva. Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey said the piece made him almost want to throw up. Putin ended with a swipe at Obama, with a reference to the Tuesday night address in which the president said that while America can't be a global cop, it ought to act in certain situations. ""That's what makes us exceptional,"" Obama said. ""With humility, but with resolve, let us never lose sight of that essential truth."" Putin's answer to that? ""It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation,"" he wrote. ""We are all different,"" the Russian leader concluded, ""but when we ask for the Lord's blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal."" The Internet responded with variations on ""Oh no, he didn't!"" But the administration's reaction was to brush it off. A senior White House official says it's ""all irrelevant,"" suggesting that Putin is already all in when it comes to forcing Syria to give up its chemical weapons. Putin ""now owns this,"" the official added of the Russian plan to have Syria's leadership give up its chemical weapons. ""He has fully asserted ownership of it, and he needs to deliver."" Let's see if he does. CNN's Barbara Starr, Steve Brusk, Jamie Crawford, Jake Tapper, Elise Labott, Barbara Starr, John King, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash contributed to this report.","Talks between the United States and Russia begin Thursday in Geneva .

"(CNN) -- ""Eat, Pray, Love"" author Elizabeth Gilbert returns to her roots with her latest foray into fiction. Literally. In ""The Signature of All Things,"" Gilbert focuses on a 19th-century female botanist who specializes in moss. She says it took more than three years to research and write the novel, which spans generations and continents. In her free time, Gilbert stays loyal to the passions she immortalized in her best-selling memoir: yoga, travel and her husband, played memorably by Javier Bardem in the movie version of ""Eat, Pray, Love."" The 2006 book about her journey through Italy, India and Indonesia brought her fame and fortune. She followed it up with ""Committed,"" an exploration of the institution of marriage, inspired by her decision to wed the man she met during her travels, after a contentious divorce and swearing off matrimony. She spoke to CNN about her new book, and its famous predecessor, in her familiar voice. Below is an edited transcript. CNN: How does it feel as a writer to have your books compared when they're so completely different? Elizabeth Gilbert:  It's inevitable that readers who came to know me, and who know my passions and my interests, will see aspects of me. If they're looking for it, they'll find me in there. They'll find some familiar themes. It's about a woman's journey of discovery. It's about a woman who's passionate about her work. It's about a woman who's passionate about the world. All that stuff will be familiar to readers of ""Eat, Pray, Love."" It doesn't bother me. I'm not offended by it, because I'm not writing this book to try to get away from ""Eat, Pray, Love."" I'm writing this book to try to do something entertaining for myself and for my readers. It's OK. It's cool. CNN: How did you decide to go back to your roots as a fiction writer? Gilbert: To a large extent, what I did writing ""Eat, Pray, Love,"" and certainly a bit with ""Committed"" as well, all of that was so that I could do this. My life had gotten so messed up in my early 30s, after my divorce and this period of depression that I went through, that the idea of being the creative writer that I always wanted to be just fled from me. I think the simplest way to describe it is that you can't invent drama when you're living drama. One of the things that I wanted to do by getting my life in order was to return myself to a place of calmness and stability, where I could do something like take on a book of this scope. So in many ways, this book is kind of a celebration of the result of ""Eat, Pray, Love"": the result of finding a good relationship and getting out of my own way and clearing out all that space so that I could be the writer I've always wanted to be. CNN: How did you go about doing all the research on the places and the time? Gilbert: I just got so lucky after ""Eat, Pray, Love,"" I had all these resources and all this freedom to be able to fund whatever I wanted to do with my life. And so I was able to throw myself into three years of study about 19th-century botany. For me, that's joyful and exciting and interesting. And it felt like a real tribute to the freedom that I had to be able to do that. And it was intimidating, because I didn't really know that much about the period, and I didn't really that much about the plant adventures of that day. But on the other hand, I'm such a geek. I just got to really full-on geek out about learning all that stuff, which was very exciting. CNN: Did the joy in this writing process come from your personal life? Gilbert:  I'm getting smarter as I get older. I'm enjoying my 40s so much more than I enjoyed any other period in my life. I had a friend who told that me your 40s are such a wonderful time because you start to get out of your own way and get over yourself. And that has certainly been the case for me. I don't have much nostalgia for my 20s and 30s. It's just a really nice time. I'm in a really supportive marriage. My husband is a great champion of me and my work. This book was also probably one of the sweetest intimacies of our marriage, because I wrote it in several months in a big burst, and every night, he would come into my office and sit down with a glass of wine, and I would read to him what I had written that day. I felt his excitement, and that compelled me to write faster. And it became this lovely private thing that we were doing together. And I think his influence shaped the book as well.

"(CNN) -- With the Emmy Awards this weekend, it's time for the predictions. Who will defend their crown? Who will take home a statuette for the first time? Who should win? And who will win? Here are our prognostications. Tell us yours in the comments section below. Outstanding drama series . Although ""Mad Men"" has the most victories in the drama series category and ""Game of Thrones"" leads with 16 nominations, neither of these two shows is a sure thing. (""Mad Men"" was shut out last year, and if the Creative Arts Emmys this year are any indication, ""Game of Thrones"" won't sweep). The real race is between defending champion ""Homeland,"" which won last year for its freshman season, and ""Breaking Bad,"" which has better odds to triumph given that the critically acclaimed show's fifth season is its last. As a four-time nominee, voters might feel like giving ""Bad"" a hug goodbye, so the show will likely win. Photos: 'Breaking Bad's' most memorable scenes . But as far as creative ambition and strength of storytelling, the epic ""Game of Thrones"" pulls off the bigger feat and should win. (Unfortunately, historically Emmy voters tend not to favor fantasy shows, save for ""Lost"" before its supernatural elements became prominent). Outstanding comedy series . A sentimental choice might also rule the comedy series category. Just as ""Breaking Bad"" is the favorite to win the drama race in its last season, so could ""30 Rock"" take the comedy crown. If Facebook could predict the Emmy winners ... However, ""30 Rock"" has won three times (2007, 2008 and 2009), so it doesn't provide the same element of righting a wrong to give it one last Emmy, and the show has been shut out ever since ""Modern Family"" stole its winning streak. Last season of ""Modern Family,"" however, wasn't a laugh riot, and voter fatigue could be an issue here -- how many times can this show continue to win? A newcomer to the ballot, ""Louie"" has a singular vision and has influenced other shows in its category (i.e. ""Girls""), which might help break the comedy category from the ensemble-oriented tunnel vision. Unlike ""Girls,"" ""Louie"" doesn't have a backlash problem -- and the show has nods for writing, directing, acting and editing, a total package. ""Modern Family"" might win again, ""30 Rock"" might even get some love, but ""Louie"" should score. Photos: What we'll miss most from '30 Rock' Outstanding TV movie/miniseries . ""Game Change"" was a clear favorite in the TV movie/miniseries category last year, and this year, it's Steven Soderbergh's ""Behind the Candelabra,"" starring Michael Douglas as Liberace and Matt Damon as his lover, Scott Thorson, with 15 nominations. Photos: 'Behind the Candelabra' ""Candelabra"" will dominate, but would it be crazy if ""American Horror Story: Asylum"" took the prize? With 17 nominations and the most out-there topics -- Nazi experiments, demonic possessions, alien abductions and serial killers -- the show still managed to be as poignant as it was camp. No easy feat. Outstanding lead actor in a comedy series . Of course, all of these shows depend on the strength of their actors. Stand-up comics, however, rarely win acting Emmys, but this might be the year that changes that trend, if Louis C.K. can take home an award. (He looks poised to do so, after his recent win at the Critics' Choice Television Awards and Television Critics Association Awards). Coming up on his heels are last year's winner, Don Cheadle, for ""House of Lies,"" crowd favorite Jim Parsons for ""Big Bang Theory,"" Alec Baldwin, who took home the Emmy in 2008 and 2009 but is on his last chance for ""30 Rock,"" and Jason Bateman, the sole nominee from ""Arrested Development."" Cheadle didn't submit a showcase episode, so there's room for an upset here. Louis C.K. can and should win. Outstanding lead actress in a comedy series . As for comedy actresses, Tina Fey, Edie Falco and Julia Louis-Dreyfus have all won Emmys for their respective roles on ""30 Rock,"" ""Nurse Jackie"" and ""Veep."" Fey might get the sentimental vote for being the show's creator and the show having its last season, but it's also time for her pal Amy Poehler to get a win for ""Parks and Recreation."" (And if either one wins, they could do a speech together! Hilarity would ensue.) Outstanding leads in a drama series . In the Emmy race for drama actor and actress, ""Homeland"" hopes for a repeat of its sweep. This year, Claire Danes is the only former Emmy winner in her field, which includes Elisabeth Moss (""Mad Men""), Michelle Dockery (""Downton Abbey""), Vera Farmiga (""Bates Motel""), Kerry Washington (""Scandal"") and Robin Wright (""House of Cards""). While Danes has the more flamboyant role, she has a rival in Washington, who is also a favorite and might become the first African-American actress to win best actress in this category. Kerry Washington: Emmys 'it girl' But previous Oscar nominee Farmiga should win. As the mother of a teenage Norman Bates, she plays a role that is at turns neurotic, obsessive and sympathetic, creating a character who might be even more dangerous in some ways than her serial killer son. (Though Moss would be shut out -- again -- she's really more deserving for best actress for her movie/miniseries ""Top of the Lake,"" even if Jessica Lange is the favorite in that category). Bryan Cranston: Emmys man of the moment . Meanwhile, Bryan Cranston lost out to Damian Lewis last year, but Cranston is the favorite to win this year, what with the series finale of ""Breaking Bad"" airing just a week after the Emmys. If Cranston wins, this would be his fourth Emmy, and he would tie with ""NYPD Blue"" star Dennis Franz for most wins in this category. Even though his competition includes two-time Oscar winner Kevin Spacey for ""House of Cards"" and always-a-nominee, never-a-winner Jon Hamm for ""Mad Men,"" Cranston will and should win. Say his name, Emmy voters!","How will ""Breaking Bad"" fare as it wraps up its final season?

"Berlin (CNN) -- Chancellor Angela Merkel's popularity will not be enough to ensure a continuation of the government she would like to lead after Germans go to the polls - and a newcomer on the political scene could throw a wrench in the gears of her plans for the nation. Despite standing 20 points higher in the ratings than challenger Peer Steinbrueck of the SPD, Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) are unlikely to secure enough votes for an absolute majority. It is actually the Chancellor's own camp in the political spectrum of the right that threatens the current government, made up of the Christian Democrats and their junior partner, the liberal democratic FDP. The upstart Alternative for Germany (AfD) party could deliver payback to Europe's paymaster, because of Chancellor Merkel's ad hoc reactions to financial instability in the Eurozone. With a populist platform cloaked in its profile as the ""party of professors,"" the nascent AfD touts an anti-euro platform, and is channelling supporters away from the right and enticing protest voters. Together, they could be enough to help the AfD garner the five per cent of the vote they need to gain seats in Germany's parliament, the Bundestag. The party currently scores between 2% and 4% in the polls. Read more: Germany playing beggar-my-neighbor with eurozone? If they succeed, it could then be difficult for the current government to muster a majority. Just as suddenly as the AfD party appeared on the scene earlier this year, consensus on Germany's role in Europe may disintegrate in Berlin, since there is now a conservative political voice breaking the taboo on questioning Germany's integration within the European Union. Neither the political parties nor the German electorate has mobilized around any burning issues this campaign season, but the AfD has tapped into an undercurrent of frustration about the euro and unease about Germany's economic resilience. Merkel has steered Europe's biggest economy well during the global economic crisis: today, unemployment is under 7% and Germany's export engine is the envy of many countries. Two decades after reunification, the nation seems to have reached the zenith in economic indicators, but looming in the background are structural factors such as a demographic decline and income disparity which, coupled with aiding Eurozone countries in the periphery, creates unease among this nation of savers. According to the 2013 Transatlantic Trends Survey, a majority of Germans would like to see each EU member state maintain authority over its own economic and budgetary policies. Read more: It's the economy Dummkopf - CNN debate highights key issue . The AfD may only have 20,000 party members, but about a third of the country's 50 million voters are believed to be undecided. As a result, there is ample recruiting ground for parties like the AfD to generate a critical mass. Even if it doesn't enter the Bundestag this time around, its mere existence could create more political fragmentation and upend Merkel's current center-right coalition. Just as election campaigning swung into gear at the end of the summer, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble predicted another bailout for Greece. This was the moment for Merkel to outline a plan for the European project in order to neutralize the opposition complaining about her lack of a plan and calm the euroskeptics in her midst, reinforcing her credibility as a measured leader in times of crisis. Instead she is riding on Germans' current sense of prosperity to usher in a third term as Chancellor. But as long as the AfD remains a potential player in Berlin, Germans will always be reminded of the solidity of the Deutschmark, and Merkel may soon see the conservatives splinter, just as the German left has done over the past decade. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sudha David-Wilp.","Germans go to the polls Sunday; Chancellor Angela Merkel up for re-election .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy left South Korea in ""good shape"" after finishing joint second at the Kolon Korean Open. The former world No.1 is still searching for an elusive first title of 2013 -- something his tennis star girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki finally managed to achieve on Sunday. The 24-year-old golfer was left wondering what might have been as he finished just one stroke behind champion Kang Sung-Hoon after carding a four under round of 67 Sunday. McIlroy sunk an eagle, four birdies and a bogey at the Woo Jeong Hills Country Club in Cheonan near Seoul. ""I could have shot anything, absolutely anything,"" said McIlroy. ""I only missed two greens and had so many chances, but it was like the story of yesterday -- I just didn't hole enough putts. ""I created so many more chances that it could have been 61, 62. It just wasn't to be. ""A little frustrating, but I'm happy with how I hit it. I hit the ball really well off the tee and my iron play was very solid as well. ""I feel like my game is in good shape going into the next few weeks, and that's a good thing."" Kang said he felt ""horrible"" after winning the title at the expense of his good friend and overnight leader Kim Hyung-Tae. Kim had a four stroke lead going into the final day but received a two stroke penalty for grounding his club in a hazard at the 13th. Kim and Kang, playing partners on Sunday, spent two hours reviewing TV footage with officials before Kim was persuaded to sign for a six by the Korean Golf Association rules committee. ""I'm a really good friend of him so at the moment it doesn't feel great,"" said Kang. ""Even though I won the tournament, I just feel really sorry for him. I was actually out there to celebrate for him, but ... I don't know ... I don't know what to say. It's horrible.

"(CNN) -- Voters in Germany vote Sunday for the first time since the eurozone crisis left the single currency -- and much of the continent -- teetering on the brink of chaos. While the campaign hasn't exactly set the world on fire -- voter apathy could prove a major issue -- what happens in ballot boxes across the nation has the potential to change the future of the euro, and of Europe. Polls opened at 8 a.m. (2 a.m. ET) and will close at 6 p.m. (12 p.m. ET). Early results are expected shortly afterward -- but we will have to wait for a few days for final results. Who's in the running? Angela Merkel, the country's current chancellor, is campaigning for a third term in office. Were she to win, she would be on course to overtake Margaret Thatcher as Europe's longest-serving female political leader. Merkel, a physicist-turned-politician from the former East Germany, came to power in 2005 as leader of the Christian Democrats (CDU), a center-right conservative party. Initially she served as Chancellor in a ""grand coalition"" of politicians from both sides of the political spectrum; in 2009 she won re-election at the head of a conservative coalition with the Free Democrats. Read more: Angela Merkel: Europe's Mrs. Nein . Her steady stewardship of the country through the eurozone crisis -- and her no-nonsense attitude to struggling members of the currency union -- has earned her both commendations and criticism abroad. And while she does have detractors at home, she remains Germany's most popular politician by a long way -- according to the latest Transatlantic Trends report by the German Marshall Fund of the United States, two thirds of Germans approve of her handling of the eurozone crisis. Who is she up against? Her major opponent is Social Democrat Peer Steinbrueck. Steinbrueck served as finance minister in Merkel's first government, a grand coalition between the CDU and the left-leaning SPD, from 2005 to 2009, overseeing the country's bank rescue plan. Gaffe-prone Steinbrueck caused the biggest controversy of the 2013 campaign when a photograph of him gesturing with his middle finger graced the cover of a popular magazine. Merkel's current coalition partners, the conservative Free Democrats (FDP), are struggling to connect with voters -- polls suggest they may even fall below the 5% minimum vote threshold and lose their place in Germany's parliament, the Bundestag. Read more: Peer Steinbrueck stirring up German politics . The other parties seeking electors' votes include The Left (Die Linke), headed by the charismatic Gregor Gysi and tipped to do well in the states of the former East Germany, and the Greens, who are ranking third in the latest opinion poll. Are there any newcomers on the scene? Sunday will mark the national election debut of two new parties looking to shake up the German political scene: the Pirates Party and the Alternative for Germany (AfD). All eyes will be on the ballot boxes to see whether they can secure the votes they need to win seats in the Bundestag. The AfD, founded in April 2013, is made up of so-called ""euroskeptics,"" opposed to the single European currency and to Germany's role in the bailouts of several struggling eurozone nations, which they see as a waste of money the country can ill afford. Seen by many as a ""party of professors"" the AfD currently has between 2% and 4% support, just short of the 5% it would require to take up seats in parliament. However, political commentators have warned it could damage Merkel's re-election hopes by splitting the conservative vote. Read more: Could euroskeptics spoil Merkel's party? The Pirates Party, inspired by a similar internet freedom movement in Sweden, was the surprise success story in last year's regional elections in Berlin, securing almost 9% of the vote; however, polls suggest the party is unlikely to repeat its success in the capital on a federal level. With up to a third of German voters ""undecided"" there are plenty of ballots still up for grabs. What are the big issues? There's just one, and to misquote Bill Clinton's campaign strategists: It's the economy, Dummkopf. Compared to many of its neighbours, Germany as a whole has continued to thrive throughout the eurozone crisis: it is the biggest economy in Europe, with a healthy manufacturing industry and the continent's second lowest unemployment rate. However, not all of Germany's citizens are feeling the benefit: large numbers of people are reliant on low-paid ""mini-jobs"" which leave them struggling to make ends meet. The Social Democrats are calling for a national minimum wage to combat the problem of the ""working poor."" The SPD has also called for tax increases -- a proposal rejected by Merkel. Read more: Germany playing beggar-my-neighbor with eurozone? How does voting work in Germany? Germans get two votes, one for a local candidate, and one for a party. The Bundestag's 622 seats are divided between the two, with 299 going to local candidates (under a first-past-the-post system), and the remainder allotted to politicians from party lists, on a proportional representation basis. To enter parliament, each party must secure a minimum of 5% of the vote to win seats in parliament. Votes given to parties that do not meet this threshold are redistributed amongst those who do. German politics is all about forging coalitions and alliances; no single party has governed the nation alone since reunification. Who will win? Until recently, the election looked like a slam-dunk for the popular Merkel and her allies. However, the Free Democrats' dip in the polls puts the current coalition at risk. Should the FDP lose its place in the Bundestag -- a possibility if the fledgling AfD splinters the conservative vote -- Merkel would have to cement fresh alliances in order to remain chancellor. Read more: Is Merkel the most powerful female politician? The CDU has ruled out linking up with the AfD -- despite their mutual conservatism, the AfD's resolutely anti-euro stance contradicts the Christian Democrats' policies. Instead Merkel could return to the ""grand coalition"" days of 2005-2009, working with the Social Democrats -- and Steinbrueck -- once more. Alternatively, should they perform well at the polls, the Social Democrats could seek to oust Merkel by forming a left-wing coalition with the Greens and The Left. Why should those outside Germany care? Germany is Europe's largest economy and its government has the leading voice in governing the Eurozone. If German voters decide to replace conservative Merkel with left-leaning Steinbrueck, the whole currency union could be affected. Steinbrueck is skeptical of Merkel's austerity-focused policies and has said he would do more to encourage growth and investment. Although they disagree on economic policies, Steinbrueck has made it very clear that should he win the election, he would follow in Merkel's footsteps by demanding all eurozone countries stick to ""sound fiscal discipline.""

"(CNN) -- A developmentally delayed teen girl was found Thursday with a person of interest in Rhode Island, three days after she disappeared from a public library in Massachusetts, police said. ""I want to emphasize the fact that she is safe, she is unharmed, she is OK,"" Medfield Police Chief Robert Meaney said Thursday morning. Police say Brittany Thompson, 17, of Medfield was last seen Monday leaving the Medfield Public Library with a man. ""Medfield Police Department received a call at approximately 7:30 this morning from the Coventry, Rhode Island, Police Department that Brittany and a male person of interest, that we were starting to look at as part of our conversation, had been located walking down a road in Coventry, Rhode Island,"" Meaney said Thursday morning. The man with her was as an adult, older than Thompson, with an address in Missouri, Meaney said. ""I don't believe the parents know who this individual was,"" he added. The person she was seen leaving with Monday was a heavyset man, wearing a ""Sons of Anarchy"" T-shirt and slicked-back hair, according to a Massachusetts State Police statement released this week. ""I do not know if the person she was found with was the person on the surveillance video ... that's one of the things we are trying to make sure of,"" Meaney said. ""In the videotape, she looks like she walks out of the library voluntarily,"" he told CNN on Wednesday. Meaney said Thompson's family headed to Coventry and were probably reunited with Thompson early Thursday. No charges have been filed, but an investigation is ongoing. Police are not releasing the name of the man considered a person of interest. ""There's a lot of pieces to the puzzle that we have not yet put together,"" Meaney said.

"(CNN) -- Silhouettes, vintage oil portraits, one-of-a-kind finds, bird imagery, lots and lots of patina -- sounds like a ""Country Living"" cover of flea market finds and Etsy artwork, right? It absolutely is, said Sara Morrow, the features director for the magazine -- but it's also the modern way to decorate for Halloween. ""That elegant look, with, like, a slightly creepy factor,"" she said, is dramatic -- maybe a little more than plastic spiders and faux-cobwebs. ""The cabinet of curiosities, the ravens, the silhouettes,"" she said, ""even without Halloween, I feel like that Victorian look has become a huge trend in decorating, almost year-round."" ""You might hang a bunch of these oil portraits on a gallery wall in your home. You don't know who they are, you don't have any connection with them, but they're this window to what came before,"" she said. ""And some of those portraits can be downright creepy, too."" Halloween provides adventurous decorators with the perfect opportunity to tinker with trends. Halloween decorations like raven figurines, candelabras, Edwardian-portrait zombie holograms or even feathered wreaths are part of the larger movement toward decorative items that feel more genuine, more authentic, more personal, she said. ""A lot of shops, like Michael's and Target, are selling products, especially holiday decor, that hark back to the early 1900s,"" Morrow said. ""People want to feel connected to the past that way."" Eschewing creepy green witch hands in candy bowls or gigantic plastic skeletons for something elegant and glitter-free doesn't necessarily mean Halloween decor has lost it's scream factor, Morrow said. The holiday has simply grown up a bit, and donned a more classic look. ""Halloween has always been a huge holiday for us at Country Living,"" she said, ""but it seems over the years it's become more of an adult holiday than it ever has before. People aren't just looking for cutesy, cartoon decorations and costumes."" So what is hot these days? Skulls of any sort, Morrow said, birds --the creepier the better -- bat silhouettes, wreaths and black lace. Even the humble, snaggle-toothed jack-o'-lantern is getting a makeover. ""It's amazing the things you can do with pumpkins when you think beyond carving,"" Morrow said. ""In the past couple of years for Halloween, we've explored all sorts of different no-carve ideas. We're huge fans of painting pumpkins."" ""We've done everything from painting a pumpkin a really beautiful sagey-green fall color and using a stencil to paint your door number on the pumpkin and putting it on your porch,"" she said, to decoupaging pumpkins with fall leaves.

"(CNN) -- Singer Amy Winehouse, infamous for erratic public behavior, arrests and drug problems, was found dead at her apartment in London Saturday, police and her publicist confirmed. She was 27. Her death came less than two months after her latest release from a rehabilitation program and weeks following a disastrous performance where she was booed off a Belgrade, Serbia, stage by disappointed fans. Winehouse died at the same age as four other music legends. Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison each died of drug overdoses when they were 27. Kurt Cobain was 27 when he committed suicide, soon after his release from rehab. London Police Superintendent Raj Kohli said at this ""early stage"" of the investigation the death remained ""unexplained."" ""I am aware of reports suggesting this death is the result of a suspected drugs overdose, but I would like to re-emphasise that no post-mortem examination has yet taken place and it would be inappropriate to speculate on the cause of death,"" Kohli said. Police were called to her Camden Square apartment just after 4 p.m. Saturday in response to report of ""a woman found deceased,"" he said. ""On arrival officers found the body of a 27-year-old female who was pronounced dead at the scene,"" he said. She was later identified as Winehouse. Winehouse spokesman Chris Goodman confirmed her death for CNN Saturday. ""Everyone who is involved with Amy is shocked and devastated,"" Goodman said. ""Our thoughts are with her family and friends. The family will issue a statement when ready."" The ""Rehab"" singer had a history of battling drugs and alcohol and recently left a British rehab program that a representative said was intended to prepare her for scheduled European concerts. But she cut short the European concert tour last month following a concert in Belgrade, where she staggered around the stage and stumbled through several songs. Audience members booed Winehouse off the stage that night just a few songs into the concert, the first of the tour. Winehouse spokeswoman Tracey Miller told CNN at the time that the singer ""agreed with management that she cannot perform to the best of her ability and will return home."" ""Everyone involved wishes to do everything they can to help her return to her best and she will be given as long as it takes for this to happen,"" representative Chris Goodman said in a statement in May. A new, but almost identical, similar statement appeared on her website Saturday, saying ""Amy Winehouse is withdrawing from all scheduled performances."" None of her representatives immediately responded to CNN requests for comment. Winehouse's soulful, throaty vocals brought the British musician stardom in 2007, but her off-stage life gained her notoriety. The lyrics of her songs, especially the hit ""Rehab,"" chronicled her troubled life. The song, in which she sang ""They tried to make me go to rehab, I said no, no, no,"" helped form the public's view of Winehouse. ""I don't care enough about what people think of me to conform to anything,"" she said in a 2007 CNN interview. Winehouse, born in London in 1983, became a picture of a tattooed teenage rebel after she was expelled from a prestigious performing arts school. Her first album, ""Frank,"" debuted in 2003, when the singer-songwriter was 19. International success came with her 2007 album ""Back To Black,"" which included the single ""Rehab."" She dominated the 2008 Grammys, winning five awards that night and delivering, via satellite from London, a strong performance of ""Rehab."" Winehouse's volatile marriage to Blake Fielder-Civil took a toll on the singer's career. The couple divorced in 2009 after a stormy two years filled by drug addiction and arrests. Winehouse's parents went public with their efforts to help their daughter, telling the London Telegraph in 2009 that she was on the road to recovery. ""A gradual recovery, which is good,"" Winehouse's father, Mitch, told the Telegraph. ""With slight backward steps -- not drug backward steps, more drink backward steps if you follow my drift. I think that will be the pattern of recovery."" Her father got word of his daughter's death Saturday while in New York preparing for a Monday night show with his band at the Blue Note club, his publicist said. He immediately canceled the performance and caught a flight back to London, the publicist said. The organization that awards the Grammys issued a statement Saturday calling Winehouse ""a dynamic performer and musician who seamlessly blended rock, jazz, pop, and soul and created a sound all her own."" ""Her rich, soulful and unique voice reflected her honest songwriting and earned her a devoted fan following, critical acclaim, and the genuine respect and admiration of her musical peers,"" the Recording Academy statement said. ""She will forever be remembered for her immense talent, and her music will live on for generations to come. Our deepest sympathies go out to her family, friends, and fans during this difficult time."" CNN's Bharati Naik and Denise Quan contributed to this report.","It's too soon to know if Winehouse died of a drug overdose, a police official says .

No sooner were the stars of the forthcoming film adaptation of the wildly successful erotic novel announced than the Internet roared its disapproval. No, no, no some fans cried to the casting of Charlie Hunnam and Dakota Johnson as Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele respectively. The front-runners for the gig appear to be ""White Collar"" star Matt Bomer and Alexis Bledel, who is best known from the hit TV show ""Gilmore Girls."" There is even a Change.org petition demanding that the roles be recast and given to that pair. Wow. As we learned with the drama that became ""Batfleck"" (yes, that's henceforth the term for the madness that went down when it was announced that Ben Affleck would be playing Batman) people take very seriously these casting decisions -- especially when it's a pair of characters they have been fantasizing about.

I used to get a quarter!'"" says Shannan Boyer, 32, a publicist. They settled on $5, only to find their son in hysterics the next morning last December. ""He flipped his lid! He's like, 'I thought the Tooth Fairy only gave quarters! I'm going to be rich!'"" she says. ""So then we had to backpedal. We said, 'Well, um, she probably does normally give just a quarter, but this was because it was your first tooth."" Call it the Tooth Fairy conundrum. When a child puts a tooth under her pillow, there's a good chance her parents are in the next room scrounging through their wallets and scratching their heads. And for divorced parents, Mom and Dad run the risk of doubling up or making each other look stingy. Pre-emptive negotiation is key, says New York book editor Joshua Kendall, 32, father of 6-year-old Sophie. ""When the first tooth came out, my ex-wife was out of town, but I called her husband so we could decide together how much to pay for each tooth,"" says Kendall. ""We decided it'll depend on tooth size."" A quarter doesn't cut It . At a time when it's common for middle-class kids to receive pricey video game consoles and MP3 players as gifts, some families worry that a few quarters or even a dollar just won't be special enough to match their child's excitement over that gap in his mouth. They also fear too much money could teach children that, in life, making bank is as easy as losing a tooth. Tiffany Bass Bukow, founder of MsMoney.com, likes the idea of using the experience to introduce the concepts of money and value. Parents, she says, can use the loot from that first visit to show a child how to divide up money for spending, saving and charity. But she cautions against giving too much. ""In general, I think people are overspending on their children, and that's part of the reason why the generation coming up doesn't have a great work ethic."" According to a 2006 survey of 150 mothers conducted by eBeanstalk.com, an online toy store, the Tooth Fairy is giving an average of $2.64, with 60 percent of respondents reporting that they give less than $3 per tooth. Stray too far above the average and you're bound to frustrate some other parents on the block. ""If one kid gets $20 and tells the kids at school, then other kids go home and are upset they got less,"" says Dr. Rhea Haugseth, a pediatric dentist in Marietta, Georgia. She tries to keep the peace on the playground by dropping hints for parents during routine visits: ""When a kid says they've gotten $20, I'll say, 'Wow, you must've been the only kid to lose a tooth that night, because usually she only brings one dollar.'"" However, those who stray too far below the average -- or, at least, below their child's expectations -- might find they have some explaining to do. Valuable lessons . When his youngest son asked why he got $2 when some other kids at his Los Angeles school got $20, branding specialist Rob Frankel decided to make it a business lesson. ""I told him it was actually a franchise, and that we were in a $2 territory. My wife did all she could to keep a straight face,"" says Frankel, 50. ""I was like, 'Do you know what a franchise is? Well, McDonald's doesn't actually own each McDonald's ...'"" Gerald Kimber White, 39, a publicist in Norton, Massachusetts, also turned the event into a kind of Finance 101. Two years ago, his son Henry, then 6, announced that he wanted the cash the Tooth Fairy would give him for his first tooth, but he wasn't ready to part with the pearly gem. ""So I said I'd buy the tooth for him for $1 and would keep in a drawer so he could visit it,"" says Kimber White. ""But it turns out that the conventional wisdom among first-graders was that the Tooth Fairy gives $2. So he had to figure out what the value of the tooth was to him. Was it worth an extra dollar if it meant losing access to the tooth? Or was it better to have a little bit of money and visiting rights?"" In the end, Henry went with the latter option. ""I liked his decision process,"" Kimber White says. ""And I like that I'm getting a better rate than the Tooth Fairy."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Poof. Gone. That's what will happen to many of the vacation days workers don't use by December 31. Americans are expected to subject two days to this unfortunate fate in 2012, according to a study released Thursday. What's more, that sacrifice comes from a smaller overall pool of days. In 2012, Americans reported receiving 12 days of vacation, compared with 14 days last year. Of those 12, they're expected to take only 10 this year, according to Expedia's annual Vacation Deprivation study. Even so, American workers still take more vacation than their Asian counterparts, the study shows. The Japanese are expected to take only five of 13 allotted days. South Koreans will likely take seven out of 10. Asian workers also work the longest weeks, about 44 hours, according to the study. Average Americans work a 40-hour week, the most common, while the Dutch have the lightest work week of the 22 nations surveyed, putting in just 35 hours. 5 cheaper times to travel . The survey was conducted online by Harris Interactive and included responses from 8,687 employed adults in 22 countries. Europeans are still the champions of making the most out of a relative boatload of vacation -- typically 25 to 30 days off in addition to holidays. In France and Spain, workers tend to take the full 30 days, while Germans take 28 of their 30 days. British, Swedish and Norwegian workers don't waste a single day, taking all 25 of their vacation days. ""Studies consistently show that an ideal work-life balance leads to happier and more productive employees,"" John Morrey, general manager of Expedia.com, said in a statement. ""Your vacation days are not a gift, not a luxury. They're yours to use."" Overall, workers cited difficulty coordinating time off with family and friends and the possibility of rolling the days over into the next year as the biggest reasons they don't take their days. Workers in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Japan and Ireland cited money concerns as the biggest hurdle to taking their vacation time. Bosses in Norway, Sweden and Brazil are the most supportive of employees taking vacation time, the survey said, while more than half of bosses in Italy and South Korea were not so keen on the idea of workers getting away. 7 breathtaking clifftop hotels . Beach vacations ranked as the most popular escape, with 35 percent of respondents flocking to the water. So head to the shore, or lounge around in your living room.

"(CNN) -- Think you have the landlord from hell? Think again. Did they steal your stuff? Lock you out? Threaten you with a gun? Unless they did, they're not even in contention for the title. Husband and wife, Kip and Nicole Macy, pleaded guilty to felony charges of residential burglary, stalking and attempted grand theft this week, after terrorizing tenants for years, the San Francisco District Attorney's Office said Wednesday. ""The actions of these defendants are so outlandish and brazen that it sounds like the plot line of a horror movie,"" District Attorney George Gascon said. How bad did it get? Kip and Nicole Macy so badly wanted to evict tenants from their apartment building in the South of Market district starting in 2006, court documents say, that they cut holes in the floor of one victim's living room with a power saw while he was inside his apartment. ""He actually saw the saw coming up and trying to saw through,"" Assistant District Attorney Kelly Burke told CNN affiliate KTVU. The Macys also cut out sections of the floor joists. Before making the cuts, Nicole Macy took the time to consult with a city building inspector to make sure she knew which beam to cut to make the building structurally unsound. ""They want to make it collapse,"" Ricardo Cartagena, a former property manager for the Macys, told affiliate KGO. Kip Macy later bought a semiautomatic handgun and threatened to shoot Cartagena after he refused to cut the joists himself. The couple eventually changed the locks to Cartagena's apartment, removed all of his belongings and destroyed them, court records show. Not done yet . Nicole Macy also created a couple of fraudulent e-mails accounts to stir up trouble. In one, pretending to be one of the victims, she fired the attorney who was representing the victim in a civil case against the Macys. From another e-mail account, Macy sent a message to her and her husband's civil attorneys, threatening to kidnap and dismember their children. In the e-mail, she pretended to be one of victims. Still not done . Over the course of two years, the Macys cut the victims' telephone lines and shut off their electricity, gas and water, court documents say. Nicole Macy told workers to board up one victim's windows from the outside while he still lived there and falsely reported trespassers in the victim's apartment, causing him and a friend to be held at gunpoint by a police. They also broke into the units of three tenants, removing nearly all of their belongings. In a separate incident, the Macys soaked their beds, clothes and electronics with ammonia. Side trip to Italy . After being indicted by a grand jury in early 2009, the couple fled the country. More than three years later, Italian special agents apprehended them in May 2012 and returned them to the United States last month. They will be formally sentenced in August in a plea deal that will send them to prison for four years and four months. Cartagena said he was happy to hear that the couple would be going to prison.

"Aboard the Italian air craft carrier Cavour, Mediterranean Sea (CNN) -- The top brass from the NATO military alliance roared in aboard five marine helicopters flying in tight formation, evoking memories of Francis Ford Coppola's famous ""Flight of the Valkyries"" scene from the film ""Apocalypse Now."" They landed on the windswept deck of an Italian aircraft carrier to inspect an armada of warships. Twenty-three ships -- including two submarines -- as well as thousands of sailors and airmen from a dozen countries assembled here off the coast of Sardinia to perform a series of joint naval exercises. But before ships, helicopters and fighter jets performed their maneuvers, commanders made the case to policy-makers for why European governments should maintain expensive navies in an era of economic austerity. NATO's military commander, U.S. General Philip Breedlove, spoke of cost efficiency when he addressed a hanger full of fellow officers and diplomats from the 28-nation alliance. Warships, Breedlove argued, gave NATO the ability to practice ""engagement without embroilment."" The implication was that war weary members of the alliance could use their navies to strike enemies without necessarily placing ground troops in harm's way. NATO forces have spent the last decade fighting Taliban militants in the arid mountains and deserts of Afghanistan. NATO's deputy secretary general conceded that these were tough times to maintain costly fleets of warships. ""What we're hoping to see as the financial crisis begins to improve is to see members of NATO collaborate more in developing military capabilities, to get more bang for the euro, more bang for the buck,"" said Alexander Vershbow. Vershbow noted that the total number of ships in national navies -- including the U.S. Navy -- was shrinking. But he argued that retrenchment was due in part to efforts to modernize fleets in the 64-year-old alliance. The key, he and other NATO officials said, was to make warships ""multi-mission"" vessels. The hosts of the exercises were keen to promote their aircraft carrier Cavour as an example of this versatility. The carrier first went out to sea in 2009. It was designed to be dual purpose, able to function as a weapon of war the could be converted into a floating hospital. The Cavour fulfilled that humanitarian function in January 2010, when it was dispatched to Haiti to treat victims of the earthquake that shattered Port-au-Prince. On a brilliant autumnal day in the Mediterranean Sea, however, it was combat capabilities that were on display. Harrier fighter jets demonstrated their abilities to vertically take off and land on the carrier. A team of Spanish special forces troops rappelled down a rope of off a hovering helicopter onto the deck of a ship simulating the rescue of hijacked merchant vessel. The Turkish frigate Salihrais lobbed shells from the cannon on its bow into the sea hundreds of meters away. Deterrence 'necessary' In addition to operations in Afghanistan and missions to stop Somali piracy in the Indian Ocean, NATO forces led the bombing campaign to overthrow Moammar Gadhafi in Libya in 2011. Two years later, the alliance clearly does not have the political will to intervene directly in the most urgent crisis threatening the region, the civil war in Syria. ""The situation in Syria has not generated the same kind of consensus that we saw in Libya two years ago in favor of international intervention,"" said deputy secretary general Vershbow. Thus far, NATO has confined its efforts to deploying Patriot missile battalions from the Netherlands, Germany and the U.S. to member country Turkey. Since last January, the battalions have been poised near the Syrian border with the mission of protecting Turkish cities from the possible threat of Syrian ballistic missile attacks. But Vershbow and other military commanders insisted that the West's military deterrent is what ultimately forced the Syrian government to announce it would give up its stockpile of chemical weapons. ""Deterrence was necessary to force what we hope is a small solution to the problem,"" said Italy's chief of defense, Luigi Binelli Mantelli. More than 30 years after the end of the Cold War, Italy's top defense official argued ""today's challenges call for a new role of military deterrence.""","23 warships from NATO countries conducted an exercise in Italy this week .

"(CNN) -- At first glance, my 11-year-old son seems like your everyday, all-American kid. He loves baseball and basketball, plays Xbox with his friends when they come over, and posts innocuous pictures of the family dog on his Instagram feed. Given these mundane facts about the boy, you can imagine my surprise when, while watching the news (again, seemingly from out of nowhere) he asked me, ""If pot is so bad, why are they trying to legalize it?"" And, just like that, the long and involved talk my wife and I had given our children about drugs was tossed out the window. We had explained the harmful effects of marijuana. Like cigarettes, smoking marijuana introduces tar, carbon monoxide and cancer-causing agents into your body. Americans agree: Marijuana shouldn't be criminalized . Neither my wife nor I anticipated that our son would be stopped on the street by unscrupulous potheads petitioning outside of the local grocery store and being fed a line of rhetoric that went against what we were trying to teach him. It turns out that potheads weren't exactly the problem; they were the symptom. Let me tell you why. If you have a fever and you go to the doctor and he tells you that you have pneumonia, do you ask him to treat the fever, or do you ask him to treat the pneumonia? Most of us would ask him to treat the pneumonia because the pneumonia is the problem; the fever is the symptom. It's the same way with the argument about the legalization of marijuana. I'm not interested in focusing on the symptom; I want to eradicate the problem. And the problem is that we're even considering legalizing marijuana at all. Let's take a look at the medical marijuana issue in Los Angeles (where I live) and we can see where legalization takes us. It has been my experience that anyone can get a medical marijuana card in L.A.; all you need is $25-$100 and the ability to lie about needing it. You just make an appointment with some company, walk in and state your problem(s) and why you need a card (with no proof of medical conditions whatsoever) and you will be prescribed a card that is good for one year. It's a toothless system that isn't well-regulated. Why are some of the people who petition for legalizing marijuana so passionate about it? Because when you smoke pot, you get loaded. You fry your brain. That's why the patients I see in my treatment center call it ""getting baked."" Pot is all about getting really high. Now, I have nothing against people who smoke pot. In fact, I believe it is a crime to put someone in prison for smoking pot. Honestly, do we really need some idiot frat boy to get picked up during Mardi Gras for smoking pot and find himself locked in a cage with a monster for six months? Kevin Sabet, a former senior adviser to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy poses a terrific point when he says that criminal processing for possession of marijuana needs improvement, but legalization is a step too far. Marijuana supporters like to argue that marijuana is similar to alcohol. While alcohol is legal, it also accounts for tens of thousands of deaths every year in car accidents or other drinking-related misfortunes. But we can't turn the clock back on that one because it's too embedded in our society. Opinion: Why I changed my mind on weed . Supporters of marijuana say that marijuana should be legalized because old people and women and children who have ailments like glaucoma or cancer or intractable seizures need it. It is painful to watch people suffer. I am not against helping people. In a perfect world, a woman suffering from cancer should be able to get a prescription from her doctor, go to a pharmacy, acquire her medical marijuana, go home and recuperate from her last round of chemotherapy. But we don't live in a perfect world, and you don't need a Ph.D. to see that the spirit of that argument is being exploited by people who aren't using the marijuana for medical reasons at all; they are using it to get high. Introducing legalized marijuana into our culture would be like using gasoline to put out a fire, because it stunts growth. Do you know why we don't see potheads out in public? It's because they're sitting at home smoking weed and staring at their television sets or playing video games all day. Do you have any idea how many marijuana addicts I encounter at my rehab on a daily basis? They talk about wanting to be productive. But what pot does is it kills their motivation -- it destroys people's ability to go out and work and to have a career. It makes them want to do nothing but lie around all day. Is that what you want for your children? Is that what you want for your loved ones? And how do you market marijuana? We have only just now moved into an era where cigarette smoking is commonly known to be harmful, but now advertisers have a new product to sell. Who do you think they're going to market their product to? Not you or me, because we're not stupid enough to believe the lie; we know too much. They're going to follow in the footsteps of the cigarette companies in the 1980s and market this stuff to young people. The very idea of that sickens me. I know what marijuana does to the human mind because I started smoking weed when I was 15 years old. It literally robbed me of my motivation to participate in my own life. I was absolutely OK with sitting around all day eating cookies and watching television and getting high with my friends. But, to go out and earn a living and do something with my life? That was all stuff that I was going to do later after I came down off of the marijuana. But, then I'd smoke some more and think, ""Why bother?"" . . . and, eventually, I started shooting heroin. If my family had not intervened and sought professional help, I would probably still be wandering aimlessly through the streets today; searching for that elusive ""perfect high."" Melissa Etheridge: Pot got me through . Even if you only stay with marijuana in your repertoire of illicit drugs to abuse, it will never yield positive results. Ever. And, I posit this to marijuana abusers everywhere: Are you really that weak? Are you really that uncomfortable in your own skin that you can't handle living your life or having real experiences without being high? Is it really impossible for you to live life without a drug? Because, if it is, it breaks my heart and I feel sorry for you. Because that's no way to live. And my kid, he's going to know the truth about you. He's going to know that every time you approach him arguing for the legalization of marijuana, what you're really doing is asking him to vote to make it OK for you to spend the rest of your life half-baked on your sofa, too stoned to go out and play with your own kids or do the things you've always dreamed of doing. To my kid, I'm going to say that this means one less competitor on his road to a successful and fulfilling life. And, to the potheads who are so passionate about being allowed to smoke their lives away, I have only one thing to say: Dream On. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard C. Samuels.","Howard Samuels: Supporters of pot say that it helps those who have health problems .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A tunnel from Gaza into Israel was discovered by the Israeli military last week, the Israel Defense Forces said Sunday. In response, Israel said it was halting supplies for concrete and construction materials going into Gaza. The tunnel is roughly 18 meters (59 feet) underground and stretches for some 1.7 kilometers (1.06 miles). In video that Israel's Channel 10 aired, the tunnel appeared to be wired for electricity and was high enough for a man to stand, walk or run though. An Israeli reporter who was inside the tunnel reported seeing markings and dates indicating the tunnel had been completed in July. The Israeli military said the most likely use for such a tunnel would be to kidnap soldiers or civilians and take them back into Gaza to trade for Palestinian prisoners. A similar tunnel was used to kidnap soldier Gilad Shalit in June 2006. His capture ended five years later after Israel released more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners. The new tunnel increases concerns on the Israeli side for its sheer size and sophistication. It is the third such tunnel found along the Gaza-Israel security fence in the past year, according to the military.

"(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton's trip to Myanmar -- the first visit by a U.S. Secretary of State in half a century -- is poised to produce a breakthrough moment in U.S.-Burma relations. Some worry that such a high-level visit is premature. Given that government's long history of authoritarian rule and systematic violations of human rights, vigilance is in order. But, to its credit, the Obama administration understands that this is not the time to stand on the sidelines and wait for change to happen. How this transition plays out in Myanmar, historically known as Burma, is a story that hasn't been written yet. The United States should actively test the new government's credibility and commitment to reform and do all that it can to encourage, prod, and push for positive change. The pace of change in Myanmar over recent months has stunned even the most skeptical observers. Following deeply flawed elections one year ago, the shift from a ruling junta to a nominally civilian government has led to democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's release from house arrest and the official return of her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), to the political scene. Her meetings with President Thein Sein represent a welcome signal that Myanmar's new government is reaching out to its opponents. The NLD recently announced that Suu Kyi would likely run for Parliament. Other ""flickers of progress,"" as President Barack Obama put it, are also under way. The government has created a nominally independent human rights body, invited the International Monetary Fund to engage in dialogue on currency reforms, called on armed ethnic groups to hold peace talks and lifted some restrictions on the media. While the recent release of 200 or so activists falls far short of the estimated 2,100 political prisoners believed to be languishing in Burmese jails, it's a movement that should be further pushed. So far, the U.S. government has responded by lifting travel restrictions on some officials -- including Wunna Maung Lwin, Myanmar's foreign minister, who met with U.S. officials in Washington and New York in September and on the margins of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Hawaii earlier in November. Derek Mitchell, the U.S. special envoy to Myanmar, has visited the Southeast Asian nation twice during the past two months . Clinton's visit represents the clearest signal yet that the Obama administration is ready to begin a new era in U.S.-Myanmar relations. The visit is also a strong signal to China that the United States is seeking to contain Beijing's influence in Myanmar. While the U.S. sanctioned itself out of playing a role in resource-rich Myanmar over the past few decades, China has been aggressively pursuing its commercial interests, and today China is the country's main trading partner and arms supplier. But Myanmar's recent decision to suspend the construction of the controversial Myitsone Dam project, which was to provide electricity to China, is a strong indication that the government is ready to say no to China when it is in its interest to do so. Clinton's visit to Myanmar, which comes on the heels of Obama's recent Asian tour that culminated at the East Asia Summit in Indonesia, also represents a reassertion of American leadership in the wider Asia-Pacific region. While in Asia, Obama shored up trade, diplomatic and military interests in the region, announced plans to station U.S. troops in Australia and pursued a multilateral approach to resolving territorial and energy disputes in the South China Sea -- a set of issues that Beijing prefers to deal with bilaterally. Re-engaging Myanmar is part of this strategic reorientation. U.S.-Myanmar re-engagement could open the way to clarifying the military's nuclear ambitions, which have become all the more disturbing in light of U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar's recent disclosure that he received information several years ago that Myanmar's government planned to develop nuclear weapons with North Korea's assistance. While in Myanmar, Clinton should vigorously press leaders to allow the visit of an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) fact-finding team to investigate any questions related to nuclear cooperation from Pyongyang and sign on to the voluntary Additional Protocol, a safeguards agreement that would provide IAEA greater rights of access. An expansion in official U.S.-Myanmar ties also could help to address a range of issues beyond Myanmar's internal situation. The nation is the source of a number of transnational concerns related to instability and conflict along its borders as a result of military efforts to rein in insurgent groups, as well as the continuing export of disease and refugees. Myanmar's porous borders, combined with its status as the second-largest opium poppy grower in the world after Afghanistan, have allowed for rampant drug smuggling throughout and beyond Asia. The recent endorsement by the Association of South East Asian Nations of Myanmar's bid to assume the chairmanship of the regional grouping in 2014 offers a significant point of leverage. The United States would be well-served to coordinate its policies toward Myanmar with ASEAN governments to ensure that leaders in the capital of Naypyidaw enact meaningful reforms that bring about national reconciliation and improve the everyday lives of the Burmese people. With a per capita gross domestic product (GDP) between $1 to $3 a day, the conditions in Myanmar are among the most dire of any country. This moment of change is an opportunity to help move Myanmar away from authoritarian rule and into the world community. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Suzanne DiMaggio.","Hillary Clinton's trip to Myanmar could be a breakthrough, says Suzanne DiMaggio .

"Rome (CNN) -- Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke, who was serving a life sentence for his role in the massacre of hundreds at Italy's Ardeatine Caves in 1944, has died, his lawyer said Friday. Priebke, 100, spent the last years of his life under house arrest in Rome. He left behind a video interview, lawyer Paolo Giachini said, though its contents were not immediately available. Priebke was sentenced to life in prison by an Italian court in 1998 for helping organize the March 24, 1944, execution of 335 men and boys in retaliation for partisan attacks on German troops. Among those said to have been killed were members of the Italian resistance movement, resistance sympathizers and Jews. After the war, he managed to flee to Argentina, where he lived as a free man for half a century before being extradited to face trial in Italy. Dubbed the ""butcher of the Ardeatine Caves"" after his extradition, Priebke long maintained he was only following orders that came directly from Berlin. Because of his age at the time of his conviction, Priebke was allowed to serve his time under house arrest, and was even able to leave home each day to work at the office of a lawyer. Giachini, the attorney, said there were plans for Priebke to be buried near his late wife at an undisclosed location in Argentina. But Argentina's Foreign Ministry said Friday it will will not accept the remains. ""Foreign Minister Hector Timerman has given orders to not accept any process that will permit the body of Nazi criminal Erich Priebke access to our country,"" the ministry said in a post on its Twitter account. ""The Argentines will not accept this type of affront to human dignity."" CNN's Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- Four former Blackwater private security contractors faced new federal charges on Thursday, the latest chapter in a controversial political and diplomatic case over a deadly 2007 Iraqi War incident. The men were re-indicted by a federal grand jury in Washington on various manslaughter charges related to a shooting that left 17 unarmed Iraqi civilians dead and at least 18 others wounded at Nisur Square in Baghdad. The indictment alleges the men ""unlawfully and intentionally, upon a sudden quarrel and heat of passion, did commit voluntary manslaughter."" The defendants have denied all charges and said they acted in self-defense when fired upon initially by militants. A federal judge in 2008 dismissed the original case, finding the Justice Department withheld key evidence, and violated the guards' rights. But a federal appeals court later reversed that decision, leading the government to seek a fresh indictment. The incident prompted international outrage at the time, and the criminal prosecution in the United States has dragged on for years. 2011: Blackwater founder enters video game business . The killings led Iraq's government to slap limits on security contractors hired by various firms, including Virginia-based Blackwater-- now under new management and known as Academi. ""The vast majority of the U.S. contractors who served in Iraq did so with honor and integrity, but, as alleged today, these defendants abused their power through a relentless attack on unarmed civilians that recklessly exceeded any possible justification,"" said U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. ""This prosecution demonstrates our commitment to upholding the rule of law even in times of war and to bringing justice to the memories of those innocent men, women, and children who were gunned down in Baghdad more than six years ago,"" he said.

Unless you're a fan of the show, you may not have been aware of Wever or her smart turn as nurse Zoey Barkow on the Showtime series. But thanks to what host Neil Patrick Harris called the ""best speech ever,"" plenty of people are now talking about Wever. After receiving the first award of the evening, Wever took to the stage and hastily said, ""Thank you so very much. Um, I gotta go, bye."" Take note future winners of any awards show: Sometimes less is more. 2013 Emmys: And the award for best acceptance speech goes to ... 2) Neil Patrick Harris, we wanted to love you more. It was his second go-round as Emmys host, and yet it just didn't feel like the NPH we were expecting. From the lackluster opening -- which featured the actor ""binge watching"" some of the past year's television shows -- to his song-and-dance numbers, it felt less than overwhelming. ""He didn't tarnish the winners' evening, but he did nothing to burnish it, either,"" USA Today said of Harris. Amy Poehler and Tina Fey heckled him from the audience during the opening monologue, making us yet again sound the alarm for that pair to host every awards show, always. Past Emmys hosts show up to help Neil Patrick Harris . 3) Michael Douglas loves innuendo. The actor scored a best actor in a movie or miniseries Emmy for his role as Liberace in the HBO movie ""Behind the Candelabra,"" and he used the moment as an opportunity to tease co-star Matt Damon, who played Liberace's lover. Calling his Emmy statue a ""two-hander,"" Douglas quipped, ""And Matt, you're only as good as your other hand. ... You were magnificent, and the only reason I'm standing here is because of you. So you really deserve half of this. Do you want the bottom or the top?"" Cue Damon laughing. 4) The show was kind of sad -- and it made some mad. Yes, we lost some stars this year, and the decision to pay homage to some of them -- including James Gandolfini and Cory Monteith -- seemed like a lovely idea. But the personal tributes from their friends and co-stars definitely brought the energy way down for some viewers and also led to the issue of some stars being left out. ""I really felt like Larry Hagman should have been honored in that group of five actors that passed this year that were honored in a very heartfelt and moving way,"" Hagman's ""Dallas"" co-star Jesse Metcalfe told CNN. ""I thought he deserved to be singled out as well."" 5) Will Ferrell and his kids are way funnier than most of Hollywood. Ferrell presented the last two awards of the evening -- best comedy and best drama -- with an assist from his three sons: Magnus, 9, Mattias, 6, and Axel, 3. Dressed more like they were headed to a sporting match than the Emmy stage, the four had the audience rolling. ""Unfortunately Helen Mirren and Maggie Smith dropped out at the last second, and they called me literally 45 minutes ago and I couldn't find child care, OK,"" Ferrell explained. ""We had a soccer game; there was a neighbor's birthday party, a nut allergy, I didn't have time to do my hair. It doesn't matter, it's great to be here."" CNN's Nischelle Turner contributed to this report.","""Nurse Jackie's"" Merritt Wever keeps it brief but to the point .

"(CNN) -- The arrest of a Connecticut town's finance director -- who is accused of embezzling $2.3 million while financially supporting his mistress in Florida -- has left the small community in financial crisis. Henry L. Centrella Jr., 59, was arrested in August on five counts of first-degree larceny after several months of investigation found more than $2 million of misappropriated funds from January 2008 through November 2012, according to his arrest warrant. Centrella had served as the finance director for the town of Winchester since 1982 and had unrestricted access to the town's assets and finances for more than 30 years. He was fired in January, the warrant said. A private auditing firm discovered an irregularity in the town's finances, which led to criminal allegations, Connecticut State Attorney David Shepack told CNN. Centrella, who lived in neighboring Winsted according to the arrest warrant, allegedly gathered the large sum of money by using various schemes such as filing inflated tax information and misappropriating town funds. According to sworn statements written by members of his staff, Centrella never allowed anyone to assist him with depositing the town's money in the bank, even if he was on vacation, insisting that money be kept in a drawer for him until his return. The financial consequences for the small Connecticut town of Winchester have been ""wide-ranging and deep,"" according to Kevin Nelligan, the town's attorney. The town has had to lay off police officers and other government workers because of the financial strain, he said. Unable to pay bills on time, repair public roads and facing the possibility of schools missing payroll, Nelligan expressed it might take years for the town to recover. The state investigation also claims that Centrella had a mistress in Florida whom he met in 2000 at a casino he frequented. In 2008, he told the woman his divorce was finalized and the two became romantically involved. Centrella and the woman were engaged from 2009 until December of 2012, when she discovered he was still married to his wife, Gregg Centrella. During their relationship, Centrella convinced the woman to quit her job and move south. He supported the woman financially, even buying her a wedding dress, the warrant says. She told investigators he made plans to purchase a home with her, and told her he would soon move to Florida to be with her. Centrella paid for all of these expenses in cash. He reportedly told his mistress he acquired his money from selling 88 acres of land to Disney World and by investing in Google stock, according to the warrant. Based on Centrella's alleged activities, there is approximately $7 million in cash that was not used for intended purposed, leading to a cash flow problem for the town, said Town Manager Dale Martin. The town is now seeking $2 million in private loans from local banks, Martin told CNN. The money will be used for pending payments until the town collects the remaining tax for the year. The man responsible for the town's financial turbulence was once respected and trusted by the tightknit community, said Martin. Centrella is being held at the New Haven Correctional Facility on $100,000 cash bail. With a civil suit pending against Centrella and his wife, all of their assets have been frozen, said Nelligan. Gregg Centrella reportedly told investigators that although they still reside together, she had not spoken to her husband in months. She claims the only knowledge she had of her husband's activities were from what she read in the newspaper, the warrant says. The investigation is still ongoing, but Nelligan said he is confident that the amount of money that has been embezzled will increase as the case unfolds. Centrella's attorney, Robert Dwyer, did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. Winchester is in northwestern Connecticut and has a population of about 11,500, according to the town's website.","Henry L.

"(CNN) -- Rita Moreno is one of the rare performers to have won an Oscar, Emmy, Tony and Grammy award. But it took her nearly a lifetime to feel comfortable playing herself. The 81-year-old Puerto Rican legend, who will be awarded a Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award in January, credits her ability to adapt quickly as key to her survival in life and the limelight. She was 5 years old when she and her mother braved a perilous ocean voyage from Puerto Rico to New York, before boarding a bus to the Bronx to stay with relatives. ""My mami, Rosa Maria Marcano Alverio, was looking for a new start, a new husband,"" Moreno wrote in her memoir. ""She was seeking love and fortune. ..."" Her mother's girlfriend suggested putting little Rosita into dance classes, and soon, she was learning Spanish dance from Rita Hayworth's uncle, who was also her dance teacher. Moreno found a home on the stage, and as her talent grew, she was able to contribute to her own, and her mother's dreams. In her memoir, now available in Spanish, she shares her journey. Moreno went from dancing in bars to performing for bar mitzvahs and independent movies. She was invited to a fateful ""go-see"" with Louis B. Mayer of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio. The 16-year-old did her best to dress as her inspiration to impress the studio head. It worked. ""'She looks like a Spanish Elizabeth Taylor!'"" Moreno recalls Mayer saying at their meeting. ""'How does a seven-year contract sound to you, young lady?'"" Rosita Dolores Alverio was born in Juncos, Puerto Rico, but Rita Moreno was hatched in Hollywood, California. An MGM studio executive christened her in honor of Hayworth. ""Your name has to go,"" he told her. ""Too Italian."" Over a decades-long run, she survived a contentious affair with Marlon Brando, a suicide attempt and unpredictable employment to build one of the most storied careers in entertainment. Now, as she prepares to play a grandmother on NBC's ""Welcome to the Family,"" Moreno shared with CNN the struggle to find her own identity, when she stopped trying to be her idols and why she rejected playing George Lopez's mother on his hit TV show. An edited transcript of the conversation is below. CNN: What incredible accomplishments: an Oscar, a Tony, an Emmy, a Grammy, and now the SAG Award. How does all that fit with how you perceive yourself? Moreno: I don't know how to answer that question -- it's all pretty fabulous. You know I'm 81 now. I'm going to be 82 in December and I stand here absolutely astonished at what's happened! Inevitably, when something very prestigious and meaningful like the SAG awards happens, I immediately go back to Puerto Rico and my little hometown and I see this little girl and I go back to being that little girl! And I'm saying, ""Is it really possible?"" ""Is this really happening?"" I can't tell you how stunned I am. I'm thrilled to pieces. Really thrilled. CNN: One of the things you describe in the book is playing the role of the ""spitfire"" and various stereotypical roles of people of color in your desire to work, but you describe your personality as being very different: ""quite prudent and conservative"" when you first came to Los Angeles. Moreno: You know, I spent a good part of my life looking for an identity that was safe. And, in retrospect, we all know that that is simply not possible, it's not feasible. It doesn't work. I didn't want to be this ""Latina girl."" I didn't want to be this ""sexpot."" I had no role models, so I chose one: Elizabeth Taylor. But that doesn't work. And what happens as a result is you live a very muddled life with respect to identity. And when you try to do that, you lose something extremely valuable and important: and that is, self-respect. And the struggle was very painful. CNN: When do you feel like you stopped ""trying to be Elizabeth Taylor"" and began embracing Rita Moreno? Moreno: Well, you know it really didn't happen until ""West Side Story."" It took, unhappily, a very long time. That happened with the Oscar, and then of course I also got the Golden Globe (for best supporting actress in ""West Side Story""), which was pretty fabulous. I said to myself ""I must be worth something. This is pretty terrific."" And then I had the heartbreak of my life, practically, because I didn't do a movie again for seven years. I was offered a couple of gang-type movies, and you know I wasn't going to do that anymore. Once I had that little gold man under my arm, I said to myself: ""That's it. That day is over."" CNN: So ""West Side Story"" really affirmed your talents and you, personally. For you as an actress, what determines what roles are stereotypical and which ones are true to life? Moreno: Well, gee, that's not a hard question to answer. I mean it's the way it's written. You're either a coffee pourer, or you play someone that's real. (Before the George Lopez) show went on the air, (Lopez) wanted me desperately to play his mother and I just kept saying that is the most disrespectful Hispanic woman I have ever seen and I can't do that. I mean, he really courted me, he sent me bottles of wine and stuff, ""I'm here because of you,"" that kind of thing. And, I know he meant it, he was very sincere and respectful but I just thought that she gave all of us a very bad name. I know she was funny, but I just couldn't see myself doing that part, it really bothered me. And you know, by the way, the lady who played it was wonderful! And what a darling woman. God, what a neat gal she was. But I couldn't do that. I had been there and I had done that, in a manner of speaking, and I just couldn't do that again. CNN: Has there been a difference in how audiences have responded to your memoir in Spanish versus English? Moreno: It's surprising to the (English) speaking people and Hispanic people because both of them have always seen me as a very strong personality. You know the Latinos (have seen me as) el orgullo de Puerto Rico (the pride of Puerto Rico). El orgullo de los Latinos, de la comunidad Latina. And Americans have always seen me that way, too. So (my) struggle is a huge surprise to everybody. They just think you got this way overnight. And I keep telling them, you know what? It took me 81 years to reach this Rita Moreno!","Actress Rita Moreno's new memoir is out in Spanish .

"Buenos Aires (CNN) -- Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner was released from a Buenos Aires hospital Sunday, days after undergoing surgery there, state media reported. Doctors operated on Fernandez on Tuesday to remove a blood clot on the surface of her brain. ""The president is in very good spirits and due to her excellent recovery she will be released from the hospital,"" government spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro told reporters. The state-run Telam news agency reported that Fernandez left the hospital Sunday afternoon. Last weekend, doctors diagnosed Fernandez, 60, with a subdural hematoma and said she needed to take a month off of work. On Sunday, doctors said she must follow strict rest for 30 days and avoid air travel. A subdural hematoma is a blood clot on the brain's surface beneath its outer covering, called the dura. Often, in people over 60, a brain trauma can cause the blood vessels in the brain to tear and blood to clot. According to Argentina's constitution, the vice president assumes the presidency temporarily in the president's absence. CNN's Jose Manuel Rodriguez reported from Buenos Aires. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta.","Spokesman: ""Due to her excellent recovery she will be released from the hospital""

"Washington (CNN) -- As e-book readers and tablet computers become more common, one prominent tech mogul says that physical books could disappear sooner than expected. In an interview with CNN's Howard Kurtz on ""Reliable Sources,"" author Nicholas Negroponte, founder of One Laptop per Child, said the physical book's days are numbered. ""It will be in five years,"" said Negroponte. ""The physical medium cannot be distributed to enough people. When you go to Africa, half a million people want books ... you can't send the physical thing."" Negroponte emphasized the efficiency of being able to put hundreds of books on the laptops his organization sends to villages. ""We put 100 books on a laptop, but we also send 100 laptops. That village now has 10,000 books,"" he said. CNN iReport: Have you replaced books with an e-reader? Share your story. When it comes to making e-books standard, Negroponte thinks that developing countries may actually be faster than developed countries. ""That's what cell phones did,"" Negroponte said. ""Cell phones were more popular in Cambodia and Uganda because they didn't have phones. We had phones in this country, and we were very late to the table. They're going to adopt e-books much faster than we do."" Negroponte founded One Laptop per Child in 2005 with the goal of providing one internet-connected laptop to every school-age child in the world. Through the help of industry insiders, the organization created the XO, a lightweight and durable laptop.

"(CNN) -- The search for Avonte Oquendo, a 14-year-old autistic boy who ran out of his school two weeks ago, focused Friday on the Sunnyside East Rail Yard, a large railroad yard for passenger cars, in Long Island City, Queens, according to a source close to the investigation. The teenager is fascinated by trains, his family has said. The source also gave CNN new details about the widespread search for Avonte, who was last seen on surveillance video running out of Center Boulevard School in Long Island City on the afternoon of October 4. Three hours after Avonte went missing, bloodhounds traced his scent to a marshy area near his school, but then lost the trail near the water, the source said. One hour after that, the bloodhounds picked up Avonte's scent again, this time at a subway station nearby, the source said. Searches of train stations, tracks and tunnels are being conducted at the start of every shift by the Metropolitan Transit Authority, New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said, adding that 50 NYPD officers and a task force of detectives are working the case. Transportation officials in New York suspended overnight track maintenance on the city's transit system last weekend as workers combed the underground network. All 468 New York City subway stations have been searched, and aviation, harbor and canine officers are mobilized and deployed periodically, the NYPD said. The previous notion that Avonte did not like water may not be correct, according to the source, who said Avonte apparently recently attended a class trip on a Circle Line Sightseeing cruise and was fascinated by the water. The NYPD had six divers in nearby water on Thursday using sonar, the source said. For the first time in the extensive search, police have brought in the assistance of cadaver dogs, the source said. The clothing company Old Navy also is now working with the NYPD and a federal agency, providing them with a shirt matching the one Avonte was wearing at the time of his disappearance. The source said officials will put that shirt into their database to scan video cameras for recognition, similar to facial recognition. The Department of Environmental Protection brought in special cameras extended on poles to search the sewer system in and around the area Avonte went missing, the source said. NYPD is also working in conjunction with the food delivery company Fresh Direct to examine its trucks. The source said there is a truck depot nearby and Avonte possibly could have gone into a truck without a driver knowing and left the area. New York police patrol cars and search vehicles have been playing a recording of Avonte's mother calling for him into the streets, Keith Brooks, director of operations for CityWide Disaster Service, said Thursday. ""Avonte, this is your mother. You are safe. Walk toward the lights,"" the message repeats. The hope is the teen, who is unable to communicate verbally, will hear the sound of his mother's voice and approach the emergency vehicles. The extended efforts of the NYPD have led to increased awareness among New York residents, with posters and fliers filling the streets, subway alerts and city papers all spreading the same message: Have you seen Avonte Oquendo? ""I heard the day he first went missing on the news,"" said Alex Toroslar, a student at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ""Since then I've seen posters at Port Authority and heard announcements there."" Another New Yorker, Rachel Gilbert, said she has seen pleas to help Avonte in newspapers and on the subway. ""I was quite surprised by the individual announcement,"" Gilbert said, noting that she couldn't remember ever hearing a similar announcement for a missing child. ""I think the NYPD will eventually find him,"" Toroslar said. ""It's just a matter of time because everyone in the city is aware of it."" Retta (who wished to not be identified by her last name) agreed with Toroslar but was unsure if the same intense search technique should be used in the future. ""I wonder if it were more frequent we would become more immune to it,"" Retta said, suggesting that New Yorkers are aware of Avonte because the search efforts have been so publicized. The reward for the safe return of Avonte grew this week to $77,500, as divers joined an ever growing number of police and rescue officers from several states who have been searching for him nonstop for more than a week. Avonte's mother, Vanessa Fontaine, told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live"" on Thursday that she believes her son is still alive and that someone is probably holding him. ""My message to my son is that I love him and we're going to find him. You'll come home to your family. And for anyone who has him, please be kind and to let him go,"" she said. Kelly said he is not holding the school safety officer who was on duty when the teen ran out of the Queens high school responsible for the boy's disappearance. When Avonte approached the front door of his school the day he disappeared, the safety agent told him to go back upstairs, Kelly said at a news conference on Wednesday. Surveillance video then showed Avonte turning and going down another hallway, and exiting the building from a side door, he said. Surveillance video provided by the police department shows that no supervisor or monitor stopped the 14-year-old when he ran out. ""Even though he's 14, it shouldn't matter. No one should be, you know, allowed to run around the hallways in school. And that security guard should have questioned him,"" Fontaine said. David Perecman, the Oquendo family's attorney, said it took school officials at least 45 minutes to call police after Avonte left. ""I don't understand how this happens to a special needs child unless there is something in there that failed the family,"" he told ""Piers Morgan Live"" on Thursday. The New York City Department of Education issued a statement saying it is working closely with police. The school is not commenting. The Oquendo family filed a ""notice of claim"" on October 9, said Perecman, marking the first step of a lawsuit against the city of New York. He declined to give further information about the claim. Police said Avonte was last seen wearing a gray striped shirt, black jeans and black sneakers. He is 5 feet, 3 inches tall and weighs 125 pounds. Anyone with information about Avonte is asked to contact the NYPD's Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS. The public can also submit tips at the Crime Stoppers website,nypdcrimestoppers.com or can text to 274637 (CRIMES), then enter TIP577.

"(CNN) -- Lebanon could have no more fitting symbol of its tumultuous history than its national flag. Emblazoned with a green cedar tree against a white background, framed between two red bands, an official account states the white represents peace, the red, the blood that has been spilled in the name of liberation and the tree, survival. Situated on the eastern-most lip of the Mediterranean basin -- in a region once known as the Levant -- Lebanon stands at the gateway between Christian Europe and the Arab Middle East and North Africa. Throughout its history it has been the scene of bitter struggles. As far back as 332BC, Alexander the Great -- realizing its importance as a strategic gateway to the Mediterranean -- led a seven-month siege at Tyre, modern Lebanon's fourth largest city. Originally an island city, Alexander spared no effort in taking the Phoenician city state, constructing a 1km-long causeway to connect the island with the mainland as part of his invasion plan. Part of the Ottoman Empire from the early 16th century, Lebanon became a French mandate after World War I and achieved independence in 1943. In the 20th century, it suffered violent shifts in its fortunes. Once known as the ""Paris of the East"" because of its cosmopolitan nature, Beirut proudly boasted that it was the only city in the world where you could swim in the Mediterranean in the morning and then drive to the mountains to go skiing in the afternoon. Others compared it with Switzerland as its reputation grew as a financial center in the 1960s. Until the mid-1970s the country prospered, but conflict between the Christian and Muslim communities, the influx of Palestinian refugees, and repeated wars in the region destabilized the country. Civil war erupted in 1975 and did not end until 1990. The first general elections in 20 years were held in 1992. The civil war broadly pitted Palestinian and pro-Palestinian Muslim militias against Lebanon's Christian militias, devastating the country in the process. An estimated 150,000 people were killed and thousands fled the country. The Lebanese diaspora is thought to be around 14 million, according to the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), with the majority in Brazil and the United States. The country had an estimated 4,125,247 people in July 2010, according to figures from the CIA Factbook, although no official census has been taken since 1932 because of the sensitive political balance between Lebanon's various religious groups. The country is known to have a ""confessional democracy"" and refers to a system of government whereby political and institutional power is distributed proportionally among religious communities. The presidency is reserved for a Maronite Christian, the prime minister is a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of parliament a Shia Muslim. According to the FCO, Lebanon is home to 18 separate religious sects and several different ethnic groups. Key to understanding Lebanon is its fractious and often bloody relationship with its neighbors, Israel and Syria. With the formation of Israel in 1948, thousands of Palestinian refugees flooded into Lebanon altering the country's finely balanced demographic. According to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), the international body set up to ensure the welfare of Palestinian refugees, there are about 400,000 officially registered Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, or approximately 10% of the population. Just under half of the refugees continue to live in camps. In 1982, Israel launched a full-scale invasion of Lebanon to counter the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). That year the Shia militia group Hezbollah was formed with the purpose of ridding Lebanon of Israeli influence. Most Israeli troops were withdrawn by 1985, although Israel remained in the south until 2000 when it dismantled a 12-mile security buffer zone it had maintained inside Lebanese territory since 1978. Lebanon's eastern neighbor Syria has also been influential in the country's affairs and internal politics. Syrian troops arrived in 1976 shortly after the civil war started and did not leave until 2005. Their withdrawal was precipitated by the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Many anti-Syrian elements within Lebanon blamed the assassination on the Syrian government and the pro-Bashar al-Assad Hezbollah, claims they denied. Even with ongoing political tensions and spasms of violence, since 2005, Lebanon has worked hard to emerge from this bitter legacy, reinventing itself as trendy tourist destination. Thanks to the rejuvenation of war-torn central Beirut, one of the largest and most ambitious urban redevelopment projects in the region, Beirut is once more laying claim to its as title of the ""Paris of the East."" But even as the nightspots and cafes begin to repopulate a battered Beirut, the country remains a hostage to its geopolitical position. According to the U.N. refugee agency, as of August this year, Lebanon had received more than 30,000 refugees from Syria as conflict there rages, once again testing the resilience of its people.

"(CNN) -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Friday said he'd accept a medical marijuana bill that would expand options for patients -- including allowing qualified children to consume edible forms -- but only if certain changes are made. Christie told the Legislature that he would sign the bill if it stipulated that edible forms of marijuana would be dispensed only to minors, not to patients of all ages. Another condition: Christie wants to delete a provision that would have let children qualify for the program with only a doctor's approval. Current law requires that children receive approval by at least a pediatrician and a psychiatrist. The bill, S2842, would add edible marijuana to the current dry-leaf and lozenge options for all qualified patients. Christie wants the bill to allow edible marijuana for qualified children only -- a move that would please parents concerned that the other options posed choking and other health concerns. The bill also would eliminate a limit on the number of marijuana strains that the state's dispensaries can cultivate -- ostensibly making it more likely that they would carry versions that certain patients seek. Christie did not ask for changes to this provision. Christie previously worried about going ""down the slippery slope of broadening a program and making it easier to get marijuana that wouldn't necessarily go to other people""â€”and these modifications are perhaps a strategic compromise to not slide down the ""slippery slope."" ""Today, I am making commonsense recommendations to this legislation to ensure sick children receive the treatment their parents prefer, while maintaining appropriate safeguards,"" Christie said in a statement released Friday. ""I am calling on the Legislature to reconvene quickly and address these issues so that children in need can get the treatment they need."" ""As I have repeatedly noted, I believe that parents, and not government regulators, are best suited to decide how to care for their children,"" Christie continued. But some of the bill's sponsors preferred the original language, which would open up the number of marijuana strains and ingestible forms to a wider range of patients, as well as an easier application process. ""I think it is ironic that Governor Christie believes that parents and government regulators should make the decision. This might be the most regulated law in the state,"" state Sen. Joseph Vitale, one of the primary sponsors of the bill, told CNN Friday. ""The last thing we want is to delay it for the kids, so we want to pass it as soon as possible,"" Vitale continued. ""It still requires too many unnecessary hurdles with physicians, but I don't think we should hold it up anymore."" Assemblyman Reed Gusciora said older residents who can't ingest marijuana smoke should have access to an edible form. But he, too, prefers prompt action on the bill. Girl's father pressed for changes . Christie's decision came under pressure from an epileptic girl's father, who contends the bill would make it easier for her to get a version of the drug that might help her. Brian Wilson's 2-year-old daughter, Vivian, suffers a version of epilepsy called Dravet syndrome. Normal epilepsy medications have so far failed to work for Vivian, and her family believes a certain type of medical marijuana -- one with high levels of cannabidiol, or CBD -- may be able to help. High-CBD strains of marijuana have helped other patients with Dravet Syndrome. Vivian is cleared to receive medical marijuana, but the state's sole operating dispensary, currently limited by law to offering only three strains, does not offer the high-CBD marijuana her family seeks. Trying to get an answer on the bill but unable to get a meeting with the governor, Wilson and members of his family on Wednesday crashed a small Christie campaign stop at a local diner in Scotch Plains. ""I was wondering what the holdup was; it's been like two months now,"" Wilson said to Christie. Christie responded that while the decision may be simple for Wilson, it's not as easy for the Republican governor. Christie is thought to be a major contender for his party's 2016 nomination for president. Marijuana stops child's severe seizures . ""These are complicated issues,"" Christie told Wilson. ""I know you think it's simple and it's not."" Governor has been cautious on the issue . Christie has in the past expressed trepidation about marijuana. ""I am not going to turn New Jersey into Colorado and California. I'm not legalizing marijuana in New Jersey,"" he said in July. As for children, Christie said he was ""very reluctant."" Of Christie's call to modify the bill, Brian Wilson told CNN's Jake Tapper: ""While it is a small victory ... it really just maintains the idea of making (New Jersey) one of the worst medical marijuana programs in the country. So it's a small victory but it's kind of ludicrous in a lot of ways."" Christie wants the state to keep the existing requirement of approval by at least a pediatrician and a psychiatrist for a child to be part of the medical marijuana program. ""The psychiatrist is just a roadblock,"" Wilson said. ""There's no rhyme or reason to have a psychiatrist be part of this decision. You're talking about sick kids who aren't even mentally necessarily capable of talking. Vivian can't even talk."" While pleased that more forms of marijuana would be available under the bill, Wilson said edible forms of the drug should be available to patients of all ages. Regardless of whether Christie the bill is approved, it appears Vivian may soon have access to high-CBD marijuana. A dispensary expected to offer a high-CBD version is scheduled to open in New Jersey later this year, according to the New Jersey Department of Health. Vivian's family also supported the bill because they prefer the edible form to lozenges -- which they say is a choking hazard and contains sugar, which is inadvisable for her condition -- and smoking. The Wilson family and their supporters have a website called Letters for Vivian at which they urge people to write Christie and asked him to support the measure. The letter says that the type of medical marijuana they want for Vivian has no ""high,"" with far less tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, than in recreational marijuana. THC is the active ingredient that gets people high. According to the letter, Vivian has been signed up for medical marijuana, but she ""has not received any medication due to New Jersey's overreaching and unsafe restrictions"" on the medical marijuana program. Opinions on the use of marijuana, particularly for medical purposes, have shifted in the United States in recent years, with a growing chorus that it should be made available by prescription. ""Protection of our children remains my utmost concern, and my heart goes out to those children and their families who are suffering with serious illnesses,"" Christie said. Are American opinions on marijuana reaching tipping point? CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Gov. Christie recommends two changes to bill before he signs it .
Bill would eliminate limit on strains that dispensaries can offer in New Jersey .
That could give patients access to useful types that otherwise wouldn't be available .

"(CNN)  -- MotoGP is the latest branch of motorsport to be hit by the global economic downturn as Japanese manufacturer Kawasaki ended a week of speculation by withdrawing their team. American John Hopkins rode for Kawasaki in the 2008 season with limited success. Aside from a brief spell in the 1970s, Kawasaki have been mainstays of motorcycling's elite category but will not be supporting a work's line-up in the 2009 season. ""Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd announced today (Friday) that it has decided to suspend its factory MotoGP racing activities from the 2009 season,"" read a statement. ""In a quick-changing business environment, Kawasaki has been promptly taking measures to cope with the situation,"" it added. Kawasaki are following the trend set by Honda announcing last month they were quitting Formula One and Subaru and Suzuki withdrawing from the world rally championship. While the sums of money in MotoGP are much smaller compared to Formula One, it is believed Kawasaki spent upwards of $40 million per year in running a Dutch-based team. American John Hopkins and Italian Marco Melandri were due to ride for Kawasaki next season. Hopkins finished 16th in last year's overall standings while Melandri transferred from Ducati after a difficult season. Kawasaki were founder members when the former 500cc world championship was rebranded as MotoGP in 2002, but have never topped the podium.","Kawasaki quit MotoGP circuit blaming global economic downturn for decision .

"(CNN) -- A bill that would compensate Ariel Castro's three kidnapping victims up to $25,000 for each year they were held captive, plus other benefits, has cleared a committee in the Ohio House of Representatives. The bill is named the ""Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry, and Gina DeJesus Survivors of Abduction Act,"" after the women who survived years of captivity at the hands of Castro, but its provisions would apply to any person who survives such an ordeal. The law would award up to $25,000 per year from the Ohio Court of Claims' crime victims fund to any survivor of abduction who was held for eight years or more; offer free tuition at any state university or college; and seek to provide the survivor with lifetime medical care through a waiver from the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. The bill now goes for a vote in the full state House, and if approved would go on to the Ohio Senate. If the bill passes, the Castro's victims could receive $225,000 to $275,000 each, based on their years of captivity, minus whatever other victim assistance they receive, according to the bill. ""We wanted to make sure we attempt to restore what these women would have received as citizens,"" the bill's sponsor, Democratic Rep. John Barnes, said Thursday, ""They didn't have the chance to go to school, go to the doctor. ... They have been treated worse than prisoners of war."" Barnes added that it is important for the public to remember that this bill isn't just for these women, but all victims like them. He said the bill has bipartisan support, and he has faith the bill will pass when it is called for vote on the House floor sometime in the next couple weeks. Knight, DeJesus and Berry were in their teens or early 20s when Castro abducted them and enslaved them in his Cleveland home for a decade until their dramatic escape and rescue in May. He had pleaded guilty to 937 counts, including murder and kidnapping, in exchange for the death penalty being taken off the table. The charges stem from his kidnapping, rape and assault of Knight, abducted in 2002; DeJesus, abducted in 2004; and Berry; abducted in 2003. Castro is the father of Berry's 6-year-old girl, DNA tests confirmed. At his trial, Knight read a statement to Castro, . ""You took 11 years of my life away,"" she said. ""I spent 11 years in hell. Now, your hell is just beginning."" Castro, 53, was sentenced to life in prison plus 1,000 years but was found hanged in his jail cell last month with his pants and underwear pulled down to his ankles. The coroner has ruled it a suicide.","Ariel Castro's three kidnapping victims would be paid for each year they were held as captives .

"(CNN) -- Celebrities are no strangers to charity work: Bono created his ONE campaign to fight global poverty, Angelina Jolie travels the world as a United Nations good will ambassador, and the recently named ""Sexiest Man Alive"" Bradley Cooper reportedly donated thousands of dollars worth of winter clothing to homeless people in Philadelphia, where he's filming his latest movie. Is this all part of keeping up appearances in image-centric Hollywood, or do most celebrities have a genuine desire to use their star status to help raise money or awareness for certain causes? Todd Krim, who founded Give Back Hollywood -- which helps connect celebrities and charities -- says he thinks there's a true desire by celebrities to get involved. ""Maybe sometimes people might think it's a good idea (for a celebrity's image) ... but most of the time it's a genuine interest,"" Krim said. ""In fact, there (are) a lot of celebrities who do charity work who don't even want cameras around."" Krim spoke to CNN about why he started the organization and whether ""young Hollywood"" has embraced charity and grass roots causes: . CNN: What inspired you to create Give Back Hollywood and what exactly does this organization do? Todd Krim: I really just fell into it. I'm a lawyer and ... in 2003 I met a lot of celebrities and reality stars in social circles who were wanting to give back but didn't know how ... I met Harry (Shum Jr. from ""Glee"") at an event, and I asked him, 'What charities or causes do you support?' (and) he said he didn't have one charity he works closely with. Because he's a dancer, I thought he'd connect with the Andrea Rizzo Foundation (which helps children with cancer through dance therapy). Long story short, he went to Mattel Children's Hospital (in Los Angeles) and participated in a dance therapy session. CNN: Do you think most celebrities get involved with charity as part of marketing their overall image? Or is there more of a genuine desire to use their star status to raise awareness for those in need? Krim: I can honestly say doing this for seven years, 99% of the time it's a genuine interest. Maybe sometimes people might thing it's a good idea (for their image) ... but most of the time it's a genuine interest... in fact, there's a lot of celebrities who do charity work who don't even want cameras around. ... Some examples: Josh Hopkins from ""Cougar Town"" plays basketball at the YMCA or Regina King from ""Southland"" and ""Jerry Maguire"" is a cheerleading squad coach in Pasadena ... she probably never told anyone until I asked. And that's what I love, that shows a true commitment, and genuine interest, not wanting to promote it. But then again, I have just as much respect for those who want to promote it because they set an example for other celebrities. And that's where their greatest strength lies: in using their celebrity status. And that's the main premise of Give Back Hollywood: We love working with grass roots nonprofits. I think it's great, (top celebrities like) Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Angelina Jolie, do amazing work ... but I think it's important to highlight other great things by young Hollywood, Sophia Bush from ""One Tree Hill"" ... Serinda Swan from ""Breakout Kings,"" Ian Somerhalder from the ""Vampire Diaries"" cast ... people might not realize it's not just the A-listers who are philanthropic, it's everyone from young Hollywood. CNN: What's one instance of a small or large deed by a celebrity that has struck you as particularly inspiring? Krim: I would say I think Justin Bieber, I have to say... I took a quick look at this Forbes article that claimed ... his charity quotient wasn't as high as his net worth, but I think that's ridiculous because from a PR and personal perspective, he's very philanthropic: I was at Mattel Children's Hospital where he personally visited patients and surprised them with a screening of ""Never Say Never"" ... and personally visited the bedside of a patient who was dying and a big Justin Bieber fan, even though he was late for his next appointment. He made it a point to visit her and spend time with her. So I know Justin does it from the heart. I think he's setting an example for future generations. CNN: Is there a particular celebrity -- maybe someone with a bad-boy image -- whose generosity has surprised you? Krim: I would say the best example of that might be Soulja Boy, who has gotten a lot of flak (he was recently arrested for gun and drug charges) ... he just came to my Children's Miracle Network event... he loves kids and he's all about giving back. CNN: What's one area where you think Hollywood could do better in teaming up with charitable organizations? Krim: -- I'd like to see more ... of the people behind the scenes get more involved: producers, directors, the talent agencies and the people who support the celebrities ... they have a say in whether a celebrity participates in certain things. Sometimes the celebrity doesn't even hear about (events or charities) ... I'd like to see Hollywood work more as a team, and all come together to support charity. Right now it's sort of splintered. It should just be automatic... and it's something that the whole team from the publicists to the agents ... that should all be their focus. It's a win-win and there' s nothing better than seeing a smile on a kid's face... when you surprise them with their favorite celebrity.","Todd Krim founded ""Give Back Hollywood"" to help link celebrities and causes .

"Peshawar, Pakistan (CNN) -- Seven teachers were kidnapped Thursday from Pakistan's volatile tribal Khyber Agency for having supported a polio vaccination campaign, an official told CNN Saturday. ""They were not the polio workers, but they had been picked up by the unknown kidnappers for allowing polio vaccination in their school, Hira Public School,"" said Nasir Khan, the assistant political agent of Bara Teshil of Khyber Agency. ""They were not directly related to polio vaccination, but had supported the workers as volunteers during the recent vaccination drive, and that's why they had been kidnapped,"" he added. Khidmat Kalaq Foundation, a local charity that runs the school, and a jirga led by a tribal elder were in talks to resolve the issue, he said. The school is in the Sipah area of Bara District in the Federally Administered Tribal Area. According to an official who was not authorized to speak to the media and asked not to be identified, a three-day anti-polio campaign had ended Friday. The World Health Organization's assistant director-general for polio, emergencies and country collaboration said Saturday that the kidnapped teachers did not appear to have been involved in a polio vaccination campaign, as original reports suggested. ""We don't have anything to corroborate that whatsoever,"" Dr. Bruce Aylward told CNN in a telephone interview from Geneva, citing his contacts in the country who have spoken with people in the area where the abductions occurred. ""What we have heard is that that's not the case."" At least 16 cases of polio have been reported this year in Khyber Agency; law and order problems in Bara have left it particularly vulnerable to the disease, which has been declared eradicated from adjacent India. Anti-polio campaigns have been targeted by militants here since U.S. intelligence used a fake vaccination program to help in its hunt for Osama bin Laden in 2011. Under cover of the program, the CIA sought to collect DNA samples from relatives of the al Qaeda leader to verify his presence in a compound in Abbottabad. Since July 2012, at least 22 polio workers have been killed. The polio campaign has a history of controversy in Pakistan. Some mullahs have preached against it, claiming falsely that the oral vaccine leaves Pakistani children sterile. Last year, a Taliban commander in northwest Pakistan announced a ban on polio vaccines for children in the region as long as the United States continues its campaign of drone strikes. Polio, which can cause permanent paralysis in hours, remains endemic only in Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan. After its case count spiked sharply last year, Pakistan stepped up eradication efforts. The numbers fell from 198 in 2011 to 58 in 2012 but that progress has stopped: Pakistan is the only one of the three countries where polio is endemic to see its numbers go up this year, WHO's Aylward said. As of November 19, it has seen 63 cases this year versus 54 cases as of that date last year, he said. A second concern is spread of the infectious viral disease from Pakistan to other parts of the world -- cases diagnosed this year in Afghanistan have been linked directly to virus from Pakistan, he said. CNN's Tom Watkins contributed to this report .","NEW: They were kidnapped for having supported a polio vaccination campaign, official says .

"(CNN) -- It happened in just seconds, by all accounts. A pistol in the hands of a 4-year-old boy went off Saturday, killing Josephine Fanning, the 48-year-old wife of Wilson County Sheriff's Deputy Daniel Fanning. The tragedy has shaken the town of Lebanon, Tennessee, a community just east of Nashville beside itself with grief. Days after the Tennessee shooting, the intersection between children and guns emerged again, this time in Toms River, New Jersey. A 4-year-old boy shot another boy, age 6, in the head with a .22-caliber rifle Monday night. They were playing in a yard, police said. The boy died Tuesday. As the gunplay persists, lawmakers in Washington wrestled this week with the divisive politics of firearms. In Tennessee, the woman died during what had been a lazy, happy day at a home cookout. Deputy Fanning and a relative went into a bedroom to look at some of the lawman's guns, said Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Kristin Helm. Later, Josephine Fanning and the boy -- who was the deputy's 4-year-old nephew -- walked into the room. At some point, the boy picked up a loaded pistol from a bed, Helm said. It was the deputy's personal weapon, not his service pistol, she said. With a single shot, Fanning's wife was dead. The deputy and Josephine had been married only about a year. In an unusual move, Deputy Fanning told his story in an e-mail he sent to CNN affiliate WKRN. He wrote that he had set down his off-duty weapon ""only seconds before the tragedy."" ""I would like the viewers to know that officers of Wilson County do not make a habit of leaving loaded guns simply lying around,"" he wrote. ""The door to the room the accident happened in stays locked unless we were sleeping or we were in it,"" Fanning wrote. ""This was the only loaded gun in the house other than my duty weapon, which was locked away."" Wilson County Sheriff Robert Bryan said Fanning had been showing ""another person that was there at the house some of his weapons he had locked in a secure gun safe,"" reported CNN affiliate WTVF. No one saw the boy enter the room, WTVF quoted Bryan as saying. ""Split second,"" Bryan said. ""We're talking about seconds for that kid to walk in that room unbeknownst to them, grab that gun and it goes off."" ""He took all the precautions, he's a trained law enforcement officer, trains with weapons all the time."" Deputy Fanning also works as a school resource officer at Lebanon's Sam Houston Elementary, reported CNN affiliate WSMV. The state bureau said it has taken all witness statements and its initial investigation is complete, but the bureau's case will remain open until the final autopsy and evidence is analyzed in the crime lab, Helm said. No charges have been filed, said the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, which looks into incidents involving law enforcement officers. ""Nobody is immune to this,"" Bryan told WSMV. ""It doesn't matter if you are a law enforcement officer. These things can happen in seconds."" Opinion: Make guns smart .

"(CNN) -- American Amanda Knox will not return to Italy for a retrial in the 2007 death of her British roommate, a spokesman for the Knox family said. David Marriott said Knox had never agreed to attend, and there's ""no requirement she be there."" Still, there remains the possibility that Italy could request her extradition from the United States. In an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo in May, Knox said she ""didn't know"" whether she'd return. ""It's a really complicated question,"" Knox said. ""I mean, I'm afraid to go back there. I don't want to go back into prison."" Knox: Sometimes I can't stop crying . Knox spent several years behind bars in Italy, after she was convicted in 2009 of murdering 21-year old British exchange student Meredith Kercher. Kercher was found stabbed to death in November 2007 in the villa she rented with Knox, then 20, in the central Italian university town of Perugia. The convictions of Knox and her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were overturned in 2011 for ""lack of evidence."" After her acquittal, Knox returned to her hometown of Seattle, Washington, where she has been living since. Italians ask: Can Americans get away with murder? Italy's Supreme Court decided last year to retry the case, saying the jury that acquitted Knox didn't consider all the evidence, and that discrepancies in testimony needed to be answered. The high court also said evidence could support prosecutors' initial argument -- that Kercher was killed in a twisted sex misadventure game, according to Italian news agency ANSA. Knox says such claims were ""a bombardment of falsehood and fantasy."" Timeline of the murder case . ""No one has ever claimed that I was ever taking part in deviant sexual activity. None of my roommates, none of my friends, none of the people who knew me there. This is simply coming out of the prosecution,"" she told CNN in May. ""I was not strapping on leather and bearing a whip. I have never done that. I have never taken part in an orgy. Ever."" Knox and Sollecito's retrial, which is expected to start this fall, should examine discrepancies in testimony, the high court said. These include differing witness accounts of when screaming could be heard from the home, ANSA reported. Knox may be ordered to return to Italy for the retrial. If she refuses, the Italian government could appeal to the United States for her extradition. But even if it does, it's not clear whether the United States would extradite Knox.

"(CNN) -- [Breaking news update at 12:35 a.m. Friday] . A biker was indicted Thursday night in connection with the clash with a New York SUV driver, according to the Manhattan District Attorney's office. Officials did not release what charges Robert Sims was indicted on. He is the only one of seven charged who has been indicted. [Originial story posted at 10:44 p.m.] . Seventh biker charged in SUV attack . (CNN) -- Another biker was charged Thursday in connection with a September 29 attack on an SUV driver in New York City. James Kuehne, a 31-year-old Brooklyn resident, pleaded not guilty to gang assault, assault and criminal mischief charges. He was released on $200,000 bond. Counting Kuehne, seven people have now been charged in the incident, including an off-duty police officer. Authorities, who have appealed for the public's help in identifying people in photos, haven't ruled out more arrests or charges. The incident was sure to get attention, taking place on one of the busiest roads in one of America's busiest cities. But the story caught on even more after video of the episode went viral. According to Assistant District Attorney Samantha Turino, motorcyclists heading north on Manhattan's West Side Highway ""were driving recklessly, ... obstructing vehicle traffic, running red lights, swerving between lanes"" when one of them, later identified as Christopher Cruz, quickly slowed down in front of SUV driver Alexian Lien. Lien's vehicle bumped Cruz's rear tire, slightly injuring him. The Range Rover then pulled to a stop, at which point angry bikers surrounded his vehicle, hit it and spiked its tires, police said. Lien's vehicle then began moving again, plowing into three more bikers, including Edwin Mieses, whose wife, Dayana Mieses, said earlier this week she has been told there's only a 1% chance he'll walk again. As it moved away, the SUV was chased by motorcyclists, who caught up with it near the George Washington Bridge. Several bikers dismounted and approached the vehicle, with one of them opening its door, before Lien then drove away again. Motorcyclists continued their pursuit, with some speeding ahead of him to help halt traffic. That's where the ordeal ended, with Lien getting dragged out, kicked and hit. He suffered cuts to each eye, his right cheek, the left side of his body, and his lip, in addition to a pair of black eyes and abrasions to his hand, back and shoulder, according to Turino. His wife and 2-year-old daughter were unharmed. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Vivienne Foley and Greg Botelho contributed to this report. Watch Piers Morgan Live weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"(CNN) -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie made headlines when he backed away from his opposition to same-sex marriage in New Jersey. Although he had initially indicated that he would challenge the recent court decision, Christie reversed course and announced that he would follow the law of his state. Most pundits agreed that Christie's decision would enable him to expand his margin of victory in the upcoming gubernatorial election and improve his chances of emerging as the leading Republican presidential candidate for 2016. Yet some commentators think this might cause objections to a Christie candidacy in the Republican primaries from social conservatives who remain firmly against same-sex marriage. In their view, Christie is an outlier, a Republican courting centrist voters who is going against the grain of the party. ""This would suit him a lot better if he were running as a Democrat,"" one Republican told The National Review. But there is a strong likelihood that within a few years, Christie might not be as much of an anomaly as they think. The progress on same-sex marriage has been rapid. While the Defense of Marriage Act defined marriage as only being between a man and woman, many states moved forward in allowing same-sex couples to enter into marriage or civil unions. Prodded by Vice President Joe Biden, President Obama said in May 2012 that he supported the right of same-sex partners to enter into marriage. In June this year, the Supreme Court ruled that DOMA was unconstitutional and that fsame- sex couples had the right to federal benefits that were normally accorded to heterosexual married couples. One of the most important reasons behind the success of this movement has been the decision to join the gay rights cause to a traditional family values issue promoted by the right: marriage. In recent decades, the gay rights movement has turned its attention away from issues of individual sexuality and liberation, and toward the right to marry. The civil right to enter into a partnership that conservatives have extolled for decades has been extremely important politically. In the early 1960s, civil rights leaders like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. won enormous support by connecting the cause of African-American freedom to traditional American values. In August 1963, during the famous March on Washington, King and others delivered their powerful speeches in front of the Lincoln Memorial, a reminder of how desegregationâ€”and then voting rightsâ€”were a fulfillment of the American promise rather than a rejection of traditional values. Unlike abortion after the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, there is much stronger potential for same-sex marriage to become incorporated into the national landscape and removed from mainstream political debate. As the courts and states have moved forward at a rapid pace on this issue, the rest of the nation has not been far behind. Public polls have shown growing support for same-sex marriage throughout the country, including in ""red areas"" of the country. Last March, a poll by ABC News and the Washington Post found that 52% of Republicans and independents who lean Republican under the age of 50 supported same-sex marriage and 81% of people under 30 were in favor. Those trends have only intensified in recent months. We have also seen more frequent images of same-sex marriage in popular culture. In one of the most popular comedy shows of the past few years, ""Modern Family,"" one of the three families that is followed in this pseudo-documentary is a gay couple raising an adopted child. While their sexuality is part of the story, it is remarkable how most of the shows don't center on this issue but instead on the normal ups and downs of family life. This season, the show began with these two characters, Mitch and Cam, becoming engaged in the wake of California's decision to allow same-sex marriage. A growing number of Republicans have already backed away from their opposition to same-sex marriage. Christie is just one of those who have changed the tone of the party on this cultural question -- a group that includes Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Robert Portman and former Vice President Dick Cheney -- in an era when polarization has become stronger on almost every other issue. As Mitt Romney adviser David Kochel said, ""Opposing the freedom to marry is a loser for our party and serves to drive away a growing number of voters who have turned the page."" So, even though Christie is taking a risk through his recent announcement, the odds are that many other Republicans won't be far behind. The gay rights movement has profoundly shifted the debate and advanced the cause of gay rights far beyond what anyone had imagined just a few years ago. By taking one of the most familiar and central conservative arguments of our era, marriage, and embracing it as one of their own, the movement has gained legitimacy for the right of gay Americans to build their own families. There will be huge pressure on Republicans in the coming years to get on the right side of this issue and movement activists have made it easier for leaders in the GOP to come around to their side. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Chris Christie chose not to appeal decision allowing same-sex marriage in New Jersey .

"(CNN) -- The powerful leader of the Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah weighed in on the conflict in Syria on Wednesday and defended the country's embattled president. ""A majority of the Syrian people believe in the regime and support Bashar al-Assad,"" said Hassan Nasrallah, speaking on television in Lebanon. It was the first time Nasrallah has talked about the demonstrations inside Syria publicly. Hundreds of people have died after anti-government protests that began out in mid-March, and in recent weeks, Syrians have fled to Lebanon to escape the clashes between protesters and security personnel. Nasrallah said that the ferment across the Middle East and Syria was a ""doorway for Israel and the United states"" to interfere in Middle Eastern affairs. ""The fall of the Syrian regime is in the interest of America and Israel,"" he said. As a resistance movement, he said, Hezbollah has the responsibility ""to be protective of the security, stability and peace of Syria's regime, people and army."" But at the same time, he asked his fellow Lebanese not to interfere in Syrian affairs. Hezbollah, which is backed by Syria and Iran, is anti-United States and anti-Israel, and the United States has classified the movement as a terrorist organization. Hezbollah is suspected of many attacks over the years, and it fought a war with Israel five years ago. It is a political movement in Lebanon and has a presence in the country's parliament and government.

"(Mental Floss) -- We all know about the Confederate states leaving the Union. But that was far from the only secessionist movement in American history. Here are some rebellious regions you won't find in too many history books. This map shows some rebellious regions that have tried to seceed from the United States. 1. The Kingdom of Beaver Island . Beaver Island, a small island in Lake Michigan, became the home of Mormon leader James Strang and his followers -- called Strangites -- in 1848. Two years later, Strang declared himself king of the church -- complete with crown, scepter, robe, and a harem of 15 wives. However, most of the island's inhabitants were his followers, so he essentially became King of Beaver Island. The power got to his head, and he began forcing his rule onto the non-believers, causing some violence between the two factions. In 1856, the USS Michigan pulled into the harbor and invited Strang aboard. As he was walking towards the ship, he was shot in the back by disgruntled followers, who then ran up the gangplank and escaped. Adding to the mysterious circumstances, the assassins were set ashore on nearby Mackinac Island and never charged for their crime. Shortly after the assassination, angry mobs from surrounding islands eventually forced the Strangites from their homes, thus ending the short-lived Kingdom of Beaver Island. 2. The state of Superior . Concern over a perceived lack of interest from the Michigan state government, the people of the Upper Peninsula (U.P.), affectionately known as ""Yoopers,"" have been trying to secede and form the State of Superior since as far back as 1897. The movement gained momentum after 1957 when a bridge connecting the U.P. region to Lower Michigan made it easier for southern ""Trolls"" (people who live ""below the bridge"") and Yoopers to mingle. This animosity continued into the mid-1980s, when 20,000 signatures were collected and submitted to the state for a secession request. However, the number was shy of the 36,000 required, and the request subsequently denied. The secessionist drive lives on today, as numerous grassroots organizations are trying to muster support for another official attempt at an independent U.P. Until that day comes, though, the Yoopers and Trolls will just have to try to get along. 3. The Great Republic of Rough and Ready . Rough and Ready, California, was a mining town founded in 1849 by the Rough and Ready Company of Wisconsin. As the town's population rapidly exploded to 3,000, lawlessness was on the rise -- and the U.S. government was not much help squelching the rampant crime. Mental Floss: Three controversial maps . Additionally, a new federal tax on mining operations added fuel to the region's civil unrest. Seeing little support from Washington, on April 7, 1850, the townspeople voted to secede from the Union. But just three months later, as the Fourth of July approached, The Great Republic of Rough and Ready wanted to have a celebration (which seems odd considering they were no longer technically Americans). When nearby Nevada City wouldn't sell liquor to ""foreign miners,"" it was decided that maybe America wasn't so bad after all. The townspeople voted themselves back into the Union on the very same day and the party went off as planned. 4. The Conch Republic . In the early-1980s, the U.S. Border Patrol set up a checkpoint at the entrance to the Florida Keys in an effort to stop illegal drugs and immigrants. The time to check everyone's identification at the checkpoint resulted in a 20-mile traffic jam that turned tourists away, thus damaging the economy in the Keys. After numerous legal attempts to have the checkpoint removed, on April 23, 1982, Key West mayor Dennis Wardlow declared the Florida Keys were seceding from the Union. Moments later, now-Prime Minister Wardlow symbolically declared war on the U.S. by breaking a stale piece of Cuban bread over the head of a man dressed in a U.S. Navy uniform. One minute later, Wardlow turned to the Admiral in charge of the U.S. Naval Base at Key West and surrendered, thus ending the Conch Republic's Civil Rebellion. He then immediately asked for $1 billion in federal aid to help rebuild his war-torn nation's economy. While officially the Republic only existed for one minute, the tongue-in-cheek spirit of the rebellion lives on. Today you can buy Conch Republic citizen and diplomatic passports (both of which have been used for international travel, though they are not intended to be official documents) and even an official flag of the republic (complete with the awesome motto, ""We seceded where others failed""). The community has even minted a series of limited edition one-conch dollar coins that can be used as legal tender while in the Keys. 5. The State of Absaroka . Feeling that the Democratic southern half of Wyoming was not working in conjunction with the rest of the state, a secessionist movement was launched by northern Republicans in 1939 to create a new state that would better serve its more conservative population. This state, Absaroka -- so named after the nearby mountain range -- was to be made up of northern Wyoming, southeast Montana, and the western region of South Dakota. While the secessionist movement was never very large or pursued through legal channels, that didn't stop A. R. Swickard, the street commissioner of Sheridan, Wyoming, from appointing himself governor of the ""state."" The movement went so far as to press Absaroka license plates and crown a Miss Absaroka beauty queen. Absaroka could even brag about a visit from a foreign dignitary, King Haakon VII of Norway (though he was officially visiting Wyoming and just happened to be in Absaroka). Despite all of the hoopla, the state never came to be, and now, so many years later, the intent of the secessionist movement is in question. Some believe there was a genuine attempt to create a new state, while others say it was just a fun way for cowboys to distract themselves during tough economic times. 6. The State of Jefferson . Northern California and southern Oregon have been trying to merge since 1852. The attempts have been met with mixed results, though the ""State of Jefferson"" movement of 1941 came closest to making it happen. The region felt it was being ignored by their respective state legislatures, so in response the people created the ""State of Jefferson Citizen's Committee"" to explore the possibilities of secession. The group began stopping cars on Highway 99 to hand out the state's ""Proclamation of Independence,"" a pamphlet outlining the grievances they held and the solutions they proposed. To help rally their cause, they developed a state flag made up of a gold miner's pan with two black X's inside, representing the double-cross they felt the Oregon and California state governments had pulled. Mental Floss: Thomas Jefferson . On December 4, 1941, Judge John Childs was elected governor of Jefferson in the state's temporary capital of Yreka, California. The event was filmed by numerous newsreel companies who were set to air the footage during the week of December 8. History had other plans, as the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor the day before the big premiere. Driven by a sense of national obligation, the Jefferson secession was put aside and never really regained momentum. While the official movement might have died out, the residents of this region still hold the concept in their hearts, with many identifying themselves even today as the population of the great state of Jefferson. 7. The McDonald Territory . Noel, Missouri, located in McDonald County in the far southwest corner of the Show Me State, has been a popular tourist destination for many years. Therefore, when the Missouri State Highway Commission left Noel off their annual ""Family Vacationland"" map in 1961, the region was not happy pleased. To display their dissatisfaction, McDonald County drew up papers of secession and presented them to the state legislature, declaring itself the independent McDonald Territory. The county went so far as to elect officials, form a territorial militia, and even printed up visas that were issued to visitors so they could travel throughout the territory. Perhaps the most lasting impression were the thousands of McDonald Territory stamps that were printed and sold throughout the area. While most agree that the secession was done purely for publicity, the state of Missouri wasn't necessarily happy about the type of publicity it was garnering. So in order to end this mock rebellion, the state declared that state employee retirement pension payments would be suspended for McDonald County, all current state employees would be fired, and all state funding would be withheld. Needless to say, McDonald Territory surrendered and returned to being simply McDonald County, Missouri, once again. And here's one more secessionist movement that's been in the news this year. From 1995 to 2002 (except for a few months in 2000), Alaska's First Dude Todd Palin was a member of the Alaska Independence Party. Fellow Mental Floss writer Jeff Fleischer has the story on the AIP: . 8. Alaska . For decades, a well-organized separatist movement has campaigned to turn America's largest state into its own nation. The bitterness dates back to 1958, when Alaska's citizens were given a simple yes-or-no vote on statehood. Many Alaskans felt they were denied more options on the issue, prompting a land developer named Joe Vogler to organize a re-vote that would offer Alaskans four possibilities -- remain a territory, become a state, take commonwealth status, or become a separate nation. Using the vote as his platform, Vogler ran for governor in 1974 -- and soon made a habit of it. With colorful slogans such as, ""I'm an Alaskan, not an American. I've got no use for America or her damned institutions,"" Vogler spearheaded the Alaskan Independence Party (AIP), and his campaign has twice topped 5 percent of the vote.  Mental Floss: Nine modern-day independence movements . More surprisingly, former U.S. interior secretary Wally Hickel got elected governor on the AIP ticket in 1990. Unfortunately for the party, Hickel only ran on the ticket because he lost the Republican primary. Never a supporter of the plebiscite idea, Hickel left the AIP and rejoined the Republicans in 1994. Today, the AIP continues to draw about 4 percent of voters statewide. And in 2006, Alaska took part in the first-ever North American Secessionist Convention, joining other groups from Vermont, Hawaii, and the South. As for Vogler, he was murdered in 1993 -- reportedly the result of an argument over a business deal. On a brighter note, honoring his wish to never be buried in U.S. soil, Vogler was laid to rest in Canada's Yukon Territory. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"(CNN) -- It has been a busy 10 days for Andros Townsend. The 22-year-old scored on his England debut, signed a new four year contract with Tottenham and then duly rewarded the club by helping them to a 2-0 victory at Aston Villa in Sunday's only Premier League match. The winger pumped in a left footed cross which curled beautifully into the net to put Spurs on their way after 30 minutes. It was a marauding display from the childhood Tottenham fan -- who now finds himself hailed as England's newest star -- as he prowled the right wing and almost doubled his tally on more than one occasion. ""It's been one of the best few weeks of my life,"" Townsend told broadcaster Sky Sports after the match. ""Scoring for my country on my debut is a highlight but the main thing for me now is not to get carried away and keep my feet on my ground."" Aston Villa's prized possession Christian Benteke came off the bench in the second half to try to grab a share of the points for his team. The striker, who has made a quick return from a hip injury, tested Tottenham's defense but he nodded his best effort over the bar. Andreas Weimann had earlier failed to find an elusive equalizer when he drove a fierce shot just wide. Spurs put victory beyond the home side when Roberto Soldado collected Paulinho's pass and chipped past American keeper Brad Guzan in the 69th minute. The away win saw Tottenham move up to fifth in the Premier League table, which is led by north London rivals Arsenal. Defeat saw Villa drop down to 13th. There was a sour note to Tottenham's victory when a flare was thrown from the club's section of traveling fans in response to Townsend's opening goal. The canister hit a linesman on the back of the neck although he was able to carry on with his duties.","Andros Townsend scores opening goal for Tottenham in Aston Villa defeat .

"(CNN) -- Elaine Dang pretended to be dead, and maybe because she did, she is alive to tell her story. She survived last month's terror attack at Nairobi's Westgate mall. At least 67 people were killed during the four-day siege. Amid the chaos, Dang, 26, an American expat, said she managed to keep her wits. ""In my head I was thinking, like there needs to be an answer to this. So for me, it was like, this is not it. I need to keep on thinking and find a way out,"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper during an interview that aired Wednesday night. ""I said, this cannot be it."" Dang was at a children's cooking competition when militants stormed the mall on September 21. She heard screaming and what sounded like distant booms. One of the presenters from the competition told everyone to run to the parking lot. At first, Dang followed, but then she stopped. ""My instinct said, don't go with the crowd, move away from the crowd because the crowd is going to be the most vulnerable place. And so I actually moved away and hid behind one of the silver kitchen counters,"" she said. Kenya identifies mall attackers, including American . Dang fell on top of a woman and then people fell on top of her. The shooting continued. At one point, the woman screamed, ""I've been shot!"" and blood flowed onto the floor. At another point, Dang saw a friend stand up and raise his arms, as if to surrender. She readied herself to do the same. But before Dang could stand up, another woman did. That woman was shot. Dang stayed down. How you can help Elaine's recovery . After a gas canister blew up, she ran to another counter where a couple was hiding. Both the man and his wife had been shot. Dang thought she had been too, though later she found out she was struck by shrapnel. ""I remember her looking at me and saying, 'Are we going to die?' It was actually the first time when I was thinking to myself, I think we are. And I told her, 'I think we are going to,'"" Dang said. Thoughts of her family -- her brother, sister and mother -- raced through her head. She laid still and pretended to be dead. After a while, a man walked by and told Dang that people were going downstairs. She followed them to a lobby area, where the doors were open and people were running out. ""I don't hear gunshots so I'm thinking this is safe. So I start going,"" Dang said. Moments immediately after that were captured by photographers and broadcast around the world. In the images, Dang is seen dazed, holding a phone, with blood streaked across her face. ""I talk about it, like, sometimes like I'm very removed from the situation, but when I see the photograph and other photos of victims or people that I knew, that's when I realize I was there,"" she told Cooper, her voice breaking with emotion. In spite of the attack, Dang said that she still considers Kenya her second home and hopes to go back.

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams became the first woman through to the semifinals of the season-ending WTA Championships on Thursday, winning her third successive match in Istanbul. The world No. 1 trounced former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova 6-2 6-3 in just 72 minutes to secure top spot in the Red Group. The American has now won her past 13 matches at the event, passing Chris Evert to have the second-best unbeaten streak behind Martina Navratilova's 21 in a row from 1983 to 1987. ""I feel pretty good -- I was really aggressive tonight,"" Williams said after extending her career record to 5-0 against the fourth-seeded Czech, firing 27 winners -- with 11 aces -- and making just 13 unforced errors. ""Petra was aggressive too, but I think my serve did really well. I'm just glad to still be alive in the tournament -- I didn't have any expectations coming here, I just wanted to come here and enjoy myself, and that's what I've done. ""It just feels good to not be out of the tournament."" However, Polish third seed Agnieszka Radwanska is out after losing 6-2 6-2 to Angelique Kerber. The German now has a 1-1 record, as does Kvitova, ahead of their winner-take-all clash on Friday. In the White Group, Li Na is ""one foot"" away from making another piece of tennis history. Already the first Chinese player to win a grand slam singles title, and the first to be ranked in the top five, she will now seek to reach the semifinals of the WTA Championships for the first time. Two previous attempts have ended in disappointment, going home with a 1-2 record on each occasion, but the 31-year-old is in touching distance this year after winning her second successive match in Istanbul. ""It was tight, but at least it's better than the last two years, because now I've got one foot in the semis -- but another foot still out of the door, so I have to see how it goes tomorrow,"" she said. Li faces world No. 2 Victoria Azarenka in her final round-robin match, and may still go through even if she loses -- depending on the result of Friday's other White Group clash between Jelena Jankovic and Sara Errani. Li beat Jankovic 6-3 2-6 6-3 on Thursday in the first match this week to go to three sets, leaving Serbia's former world No. 1 with a 1-1 record ahead of her final match against Errani -- who is out of contention following two defeats. Azarenka, who beat Li in January's Australian Open final when she was the top-ranked woman, also has a win and a loss. The Belorussian has won their past five encounters, including at the WTA Championships in 2011 and 2012, but has been in poor form recently with just one win in four matches since losing the U.S. Open final to Williams. Meanwhile, Grigor Dimitrov -- known earlier in his career as ""Baby Federer"" -- will face the real thing in Friday's quarterfinals at the Swiss Indoors event. The Bulgarian, who claimed his first ATP Tour title in Stockholm last weekend, earned a clash with 17-time grand slam winner Roger Federer by beating Alexandr Dolgopolov 6-3 6-2. Defending champion Juan Martin del Potro set up a clash with French qualifier Paul-Henri Mathieu, while Edouard Roger-Vasselin and Daniel Brands also went through to the last eight.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- On a recent day in Los Angeles, hordes of Depeche Mode fans made their way toward the intersection of Hollywood and Vine for a free concert by their heroes on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live."" A smiling (!) Dave Gahan performs in Los Angeles in late April. Most were clad in black T-shirts and black pants -- the uniform of the true Depeche Mode devotee. The three members of Depeche Mode are still partial to wearing black, but their attitude is a lot lighter and brighter than their music and history would suggest. Thirteen years ago, singer Dave Gahan famously died from a drug overdose and was brought back to life by paramedics at the Sunset Marquis hotel down the road. Since then, he's given up drugs and taken up yoga and songwriting, the latter being what used to be the exclusive domain of guitarist Martin Gore (who has since sobered up himself). It's changed the dynamics of the trio, known for such hits as ""Personal Jesus,"" but in a good way, says Depeche Mode keyboardist Andy Fletcher. CNN spoke to the group's members about Depeche Mode's new album, ""Sounds of the Universe,"" their three decades in the business and the effects of heavy drinking. The following is an edited version of the interview.  Watch the band perform, laugh » . CNN: Have you looked outside the window to see the street closures out there, and 10,000 people gathering? Andy Fletcher: (All three members laugh) It can't be happening. It's not anything to do with us. U2 are probably in town. CNN: Closing down the street for a free concert is a big deal in Hollywood. Dave Gahan: When we were first approached to do it, we were kind of in some trepidation about what it was really going to be, and if people were going to show up. CNN: Were you afraid that only two people were going to show up? Gahan: Well, we're always like that -- until we actually go on stage and see the people. CNN: I can't believe it's been almost 30 years since Depeche Mode first formed. Gahan: I think next year is our 30th year. Fletcher: To be honest, I think at first when we found out it was going to be 30 years, I think it was, ""Oh my God, how embarrassing. We're really old!"" But I think now we've really got our heads around it, and I think it's something to be actually proud of. CNN: On your last album, ""Playing the Angel,"" there was a little tension because Martin, for the most part, had written all of the songs -- and Dave wanted to contribute to the writing process. But on the new CD, ""Sounds of the Universe,"" it seems as though everybody was more comfortable sharing songwriting duties. Gahan: When I kind of approached the band with a whole bunch of demos and said, ""I want half the songs on the record,"" of course that didn't go down well (on the last album). I was a little bit overconfident, as well. But to me, it was just the excitement about this new thing, which was writing. There's no way I could go back to not being involved in the writing. Martin Gore: To be honest, I think it's one of the big factors in Depeche Mode being much stronger now, and being better. I think Dave is a great frontman ... Gahan: Thanks, man! Gore: ... and singing someone else's lyrics, he's great. But I think now he really believes he contributes so much more to the band. So I think it's made the band -- the atmosphere between us -- much better, actually. So it's been a good thing. CNN: Martin, you've given up drinking. Gore: Yeah. It's been about three years now. It makes a big difference. Gahan: He is a changed man. There's a different side of Martin that has always been there, but sometimes it gets clouded when the drinking and stuff becomes more important than anything else. I think it got to that phase on the last tour, and Martin was the one that stood up and said, ""You know what? I've got to stop this."" It's sort of one of those cliches, one of those myths, that you have to be really messed up to do something cool artistically. CNN: Did you believe that? Gahan: Yeah, I did for awhile. Yeah. When it's not actually producing anything creative at all, you're in trouble. CNN: So Andy, in the meantime, you've got two sober bandmates over here. Gahan: It's good for me, as well. (Gahan and Gore laugh heartily). Gore: He's cut down to 50 units a week now! Fletcher: I've cut down but -- . Gahan: He's under pressure. Fletcher: These things are happening to make the atmosphere better. So it's got to be good. Gahan: Martin's always worked very hard on his songs, and they've always been great. Fletcher: He also worked very hard on his drinking. (Everyone laughs). You know, when it takes over, it's not funny anymore. But in the studio, when we made this record, Mart was the first there and the last to leave, and worked really, really hard, was really focused -- and that was a joy to be around. It felt great. Gore: I used to put in, like, maybe three hours and then have to go home on the last hour. CNN: Do you feel there's less tolerance for that type of excessive behavior in music these days? Gore: I think being in a band is probably the only job when you're actively encouraged to be out of it most of the time. You know, people like seeing people in bands being messed up. And, you know, people are always buying you drinks. They want to see you like that. CNN: So what do you tell them now? Gore: I just -- I don't go out that much anymore. (Everyone laughs) CNN: You stay and do yoga with Dave, right? Gahan: Not yet. We haven't gotten to that phase yet. That's a bit scary -- to start doing yoga together. CNN: Stranger things have happened after 30 years. Gahan: It takes a lot of hard work, and it takes a lot of discipline as well, to continue doing this. You've got to somehow learn to enjoy doing this. There's different phases over the years of the three decades. When we started out, we were barely out of our teenage years. Of course we had a lot of fun for many, many years -- going out to parties, and clubs and bars. But, you know, there comes a time when you have to draw the line.","Depeche Mode's new album is ""Sounds of the Universe""

"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho's imminent return to Chelsea appears to be the worst-kept secret in world football -- and the English Premier League has already jumped the gun by announcing his reappointment before a deal has been done. The EPL's website published a story on Sunday, dated Monday, with the headline ""Jose Mourinho makes Chelsea return."" Its subheader read: ""Portuguese coach back at Stamford Bridge after signing a XX-year contract."" The story was taken down, and the EPL issued a statement apologizing to Chelsea -- which is searching for a new manager following the departure of interim coach Rafael Benitez. ""It was a publishing error. We took it down as soon as we were notified of it, and we've spoken to and apologized to Chelsea,"" it said. ""We have no prior knowledge of any movement or any announcement."" Chelsea has made no comment. Mourinho's final game in charge of Real Madrid was Saturday's 4-2 win over Osasuna, which left the Spanish club in second place in La Liga -- 15 points behind Barcelona. The 50-year-old did not talk to reporters after the match, though he did an interview with Spanish television in which he denied omitting goalkeeper Iker Casillas and defender Pepe -- with whom he has had public disputes -- and top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo for any other reason than they were not fit enough to play. Last month he described this season as the worst in his career after losing the Spanish Cup final to Atletico Madrid, meaning no trophy for Real in 2012-13. ""I wish everyone associated with Real Madrid much happiness in the future,"" he said in a statement on Friday. ""I appreciate the support of lots of fans and respect the criticism of others. Once again, a lot of happiness to everyone and, above all, good health. Hala Madrid!"" Mourinho officially joined Chelsea on June 2, 2004 -- the EPL website ran an archive feature on Sunday -- and dubbed himself ""the Special One"" after having led Porto to the European title the previous season. He was unable to take Chelsea to the Champions League final, but guided the club to two successive EPL titles -- its first English championship successes since 1955. After falling out with Chelsea's Russian owner Roman Abramovich in 2007, Mourinho joined Inter Milan the following season and won two successive Italian Serie A titles and the Champions League in 2010. He was then courted by Real with the goal of ending the club's long wait for a record-extending 10th European title, but despite winning La Liga in his second season Madrid fell three times at the semifinal stage of the Champions League and his relationship with key Spanish players such as Casillas deteriorated. As in Italy, he had a prickly time with the local press -- who took every opportunity to publish stories about dressing-room unrest at the Santiago Bernabeu.

"Remember the days when a washing machine lasted for decades? If it broke down it could be fixed. But now it seems it is cheaper to discard our broken products and buy new ones. The side effects of our throwaway society are ever-larger waste mountains festering with toxic chemicals and the depletion of natural resources such as rare metals. Europe produced 8.3 to 9.1 millions tons of waste from electrical projects in 2005. Product makers are responding by designing goods that have a reduced carbon footprint at their point of manufacture, but leading thinkers in the field of sustainable design believe that a radical re-think in the way we consume products is required if we want to halt the growing mountain of toxic waste piling up on the world's rubbish dumps. Figures recently announced by the U.N. University suggest the production of electronic and electrical products is running neck-and-neck with their disposal: An estimated 10.3 million tons of electronic products were put on the market in the European Union in 2005, while 8.3 to 9.1 million tons of waste from electrical products found their way into Europe's rubbish bins. Electronic and electrical products account for four percent of Europe's waste and the rate is growing at three times the speed of any other form of waste. What is sustainable design? Sustainable design is a reaction to the global environmental crisis. It aims to produce products, buildings and services, which have a low impact on climate change and the depletion of the world's resources. In industrial design this includes the use of recycled and recyclable materials; reducing pollution through cutting down the need for transportation, such as by using locally-sourced materials; making products which can be taken apart once they are discarded so that their parts that can be used again; and designing goods which use as little energy as possible while they are being made. While many companies are beginning to think of ways in which they can reduce their environmental impact during the manufacture of their products, many sustainable design experts believe that these measures are not enough to reduce the damage the constant manufacture of products is doing to the world's eco-system. A change in culture . ""Daily life is becoming increasingly mediated by electronic artifacts,"" says Jonathan Chapman, editor of Designers, Visionaries and Other Stories, a book which seeks to bring together new thinking on sustainable design. ""These products are great but it seems that as their popularity grows, their impermanence grows with it."" Chapman believes that true sustainability can only be achieved if we moderate our inclination to strive for the newest product, and he argues that the onus is on designers to initiate a shift away from a disposable culture. He proposes a model for consumer behavior based on a service economy -- that products are designed to last longer and to be fixed when they break; brands can make their profits by providing the services to ensure that this can be done. ""It's quite conceivable to make objects that don't necessarily make a profit at the point-of-sale but that, because their life-spans are extended and are punctuated with service and upgrade options, can generate turnover over long periods of time that is greater than making a small profit and having to remanufacture,"" he explains. He believes that consumers would be prepared to pay more for their electronic goods if they knew they would last longer. It is an economic model that would make most manufacturers choke, but it is an unfounded fear, says economist Andrew Charlton, author of Ozonomics: Inside the Myth of Australia's Economic Superheroes. ""The key thing to remember is that human desires know no bounds -- we are never satiated,"" he says. ""If we replace an expensive disposable product with a permanent one, that just frees up income to spend on other things. ""Ballpoint pens last longer than quills, tarred roads last longer than cobblestones -- and the economy moves on. Every time we satisfy one demand, another one comes along to take its place."" ""A quarter-inch hole"" But it's not enough to expect consumers to sign up to a longer-life model just because it is 'green', says Steve Bishop, head of sustainability at design firm IDEO. Consumers concerned with the sustainability of the products they buy still only make up a small fraction of the market and designers must incorporate energy-saving measures into mainstream thinking, with sustainability as a by-product. Marketing a product as environmentally friendly is ""really addressing a niche market,"" he argues. ""It's putting the responsibility on people and it's effectively guilting people into buying these things. It shouldn't be about guilt or sacrifice. It should be about connecting to people's values and what really matters to them."" Often what really matters to people is saving money. He cites as an example of sustainability-achieved-by-stealth some research IDEO made into the effectiveness of hybrid electric cars. They found that the single feature of the cars that maximized their energy-efficiency was not the variable transmission, the regenerative brakes or the electric motor but a small widget on the dashboard that measures fuel consumption and tells you when you are driving the car most efficiently. ""It's not so much that they are trying to be green as much as they are trying to get high score,"" Bishop concludes. Sustainability must understand and adapt to human behavior, not vice versa, is his verdict. ""People don't want a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole,"" Theodore Levitt, former marketing professor at Harvard Business School and author of Marketing Myopia, used to tell his students. Apple's iTunes software, a service which allows music fans to download audio files directly onto their computers, is an example of Levitt's analogy in action. While its main aim was to make listening to music easier, it has inadvertently become a sustainable design model by canceling the need for the compact disc. People still get their end-product -- listening to music -- but without the waste and unnecessary energy consumption that goes into manufacturing a physical item on which to store it. His point is that businesses will have to shift their goal posts and might even have to change the mentality that says that producing more products is the only way to make money. Making a real impact . Environmental issues are becoming increasingly important to the public and manufacturers may have to combine 'green' production techniques with a dramatic change in how consumers relate to the products they buy. ""The real impact happens when you integrate both those things - when you look at the scientific basis and reduce the energy footprint during production but you also look at the psychological and emotional factors during use,"" says Chapman. ""When you start to integrate like that, that's when you start to achieve sustainable design."" E-mail to a friend .","Europeans find it cheaper to throw away rather than fix electrical products .

"(CNN) -- For years, Allan Munroe refused to leave his wife's side. Norma, his bride of more than six decades, was battling stage four lung cancer. As her health declined, Munroe welcomed the distraction of his second love: the Boston Red Sox. He kept his TV tuned to his favorite team's games to keep his mind off losing the woman he describes as the ""better part of himself."" Norma Munroe died in May. Angela McKinnon said that after her grandmother's death she knew she had to get her grandfather to Fenway one last time, if only because of his age and health. ""After everything that happened, it was a horrible ordeal. We were talking about how life is short, and you just kind of have to make things happen,"" she said. Next weekend, Munroe will travel 1,000 miles to see his favorite team play in person for the first time in 50 years. His dream is coming true thanks to the generosity of strangers and a crowd-funding page his granddaughter set up. McKinnon decided to start a GoFundMe page called ""ShipGpaUpToBoston"" (named for the Dropkick Murphy's song ""I'm Shipping Up To Boston,"" a Boston sports team anthem.) ""Now is the time for my grandfather's wish to come true, because no one is guaranteed tomorrow,"" she wrote on the website. Munroe has had a number of medical setbacks in the past few years, including recently breaking his hip and being in the early stages of dementia. The family had no money to get Munroe from his home in Florida to Fenway. McKinnon asked for help, but the donations came in slowly. She then started tweeting her grandfather's story to everyone she could. Eventually, McKinnon's mission to get her grandfather to Boston caught the attention of one very important member of the Red Sox organization: owner John Henry's wife, Linda Pizzuti Henry. Pizzuti Henry e-mailed McKinnon, saying in part: ""Your grandfather sounds like an incredible man. Best of luck with your trip. I will happily provide game tickets, lunch at the game, and a private tour of the ballpark. Let me know the number of tickets needed."" Red Sox spokeswoman Zineb Curran said Pizzuti Henry read about Munroe's story on Twitter and was ""touched by how the Red Sox provided such comfort to him while his wife was sick and how his family was doing what they could to create a special experience to share with him."" McKinnon says the response from friends and strangers has been amazing. With the help of the Red Sox and other Boston-area businesses pitching in for the family's airfare and hotel, any money left over from the donations raised will be donated to the Jimmy Fund, an organization that raises funds for adult and pediatric cancer care. Before the game, the family plans to visit a commemorative brick they bought for Munroe that reads ""Allan Munroe Has 2 Tru loves, Norma & The Sox.""","Allan Munroe, 87, is a lifelong Red Sox fan .

"(CNN) -- Before there was the famous Red Bull, there was Krating Daeng, a sweet energy drink sold in Thailand and a few other countries. Its labels feature two red bulls charging one another. Chaleo Yoovidhya, who with an Austrian entrepreneur transformed his noncarbonated concoction into the global brand Red Bull, died of natural causes Saturday, according to MCOT, Thailand's national news agency. Chaleo was in his 80s. The self-made business mogul was ranked 205th this year in Forbes' list of billionaires, with a net worth estimated at $5 billion. That made him Thailand's third wealthiest person. Chaleo also founded TC Pharmaceuticals. Chaleo and Dietrich Mateschitz adapted the formula to Western tastes in 1984. Krating Daeng translates to Red Bull in English. They each owned 49% of the privately held company, with Chaleo's son holding the balance of 2%. Mateschitz ran the company, according to MCOT. The battling bovines, the slogan ""Red Bull Gives You Wings"" and the berry-flavored drink blended to become a worldwide commercial bonanza. Red Bull, headquartered in Austria, is available in 164 countries worldwide. The company also owns sports and racing teams. Much of Red Bull's marketing and distribution success is due to Mateschitz, who became aware of ""tonic drinks"" in the Far East. Krating Daeng became popular in Asia in the 1970s and 1980s, especially among truck drivers, construction workers and farmers, according to MCOT. On business trips, Mateschitz tried a drink sold in Thai pharmacies as a revitalizing agent. He noticed it put a dent in his jet lag. ""I realized that these little syrups developed in Japan did extremely well all over Asia,"" Mateschitz told Forbes in 2005. The Austrian, after studying the market, and Chaleo decided to co-found Red Bull, each investing $500,000 in their bid to reach the global market, according to Forbes. Since 1987, an estimated 30 billion cans of Red Bull have been consumed, according to the company.","Chaleo Yoovidhya co-founded Red Bull, the energy drink company .

"(CNN) -- A former Ohio doctor was sentenced Tuesday to life in prison for poisoning his wife with cyanide five years ago. A Cleveland jury convicted Yazeed Essa last week of aggravated murder for poisoning Rosemarie Essa, his wife and the mother of his two children, with a cyanide-laced calcium pill. Essa, 41, will be eligible for parole in 20 years, Cuyahoga County prosecutor Bill Mason said. His crime occurred before Ohio sentencing laws were changed to give judges discretion in determining when a convicted murderer is eligible for parole. Dressed in an orange jailhouse jumpsuit, Essa did not betray an emotion as Judge Deena Calabrese lamented that she could not hand down a stiffer sentence . ""I regret that you have the benefit of committing this crime under the old law,"" Calabrese told Essa. ""You took an oath to preserve life and you destroyed your family,"" she said. ""I cannot imagine the evil that you have done to these people, especially your children. It is my great hope and the only that I can think of at this moment that they forget you ... and that whatever legacy you had is wiped away."" The six-week trial included testimony from more than 60 witnesses who told the story of a philandering doctor, his many mistresses and an international manhunt that crossed three continents and ended with his arrest in Cyprus in October 2006, 18 months after his wife's death. ""What do you say to a person that murders the mother of his children, a murdering coward with no heart, no compassion, no remorse?"" Rosemarie Essa's mother, Virginia DiPuccio, said at her son-in-law's sentencing hearing Tuesday. ""All she wanted was children and a husband that loved her back and you took that away. She didn't deserve it,"" DiPuccio said as other relatives sat in the packed courtroom audience, dabbing tears with tissues. Essa fled the United States in March 2005 after police questioned him about his wife's death. He was arrested in Cyprus on October 7, 2006, for using fake travel documents. In January 2009, Essa was extradited to Cuyahoga County, according to the prosecutor's office. Defense attorneys pointed to a lack of physical evidence linking Essa to the tainted supplements and urged jurors not to convict him for his playboy lifestyle. The defense also attempted to cast suspicion on Essa's mistresses. Two of them testified, one saying she never loved Essa and another saying she believed him when he promised to be her soul mate. The 38-year-old mother of two and former nurse was driving to the movies in the family Volvo on February 24, 2005, when she felt ill, passed out and hit another vehicle before stopping against a curb. Before she crashed, she called a friend from her car and told her that she was beginning to feel sick to her stomach and wondered whether a supplement her husband had given her was making her ill. Jurors heard from the friend, Eva Gardner, along with two of Essa's mistresses and his brother, who said Essa admitted to killing his wife. DiPuccio said her daughter made the phone call so he wouldn't get away with murder. ""It didn't go your way,"" she said, as a stone-faced Essa listened. ""She got you, Yaz, and the Essa curse ends here today. We have Rosie in our memory. She's in our hearts and with us always.""","Yazeed Essa was convicted last week of giving wife calcium pills laced with cyanide .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actress Brittany Murphy's death was an accident caused by a combination of pneumonia, an iron deficiency and ""multiple drug intoxication,"" the Los Angeles County coroner said Thursday. The 32-year-old actress was found dead in her Hollywood Hills, California, home December 20. The short statement issued by the coroner's office Thursday did not list the drugs involved, but assistant chief Ed Winter told CNN no illegal drugs were found in Murphy's system. The full autopsy report would be available within two weeks, the coroner's office said. The primary cause of death was ""community acquired pneumonia,"" but drugs found by the toxicology screening were believed to ""play a role in her death,"" said coroner's spokesman Craig Harvey. ""They just were not the primary cause, so they figured into the cause of death, so that's why it's an accidental death."" Murphy's husband, British screenwriter Simon Monjack, has told People magazine the actress had ""laryngitis and flu-like symptoms"" at the time of her death. Monjack said Murphy used Vicoprofen to relieve pain from severe menstrual cramps. ""She was on an antibiotic and was taking cough medicine,"" he said. Murphy was pronounced dead at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, after she was rushed there in the early morning hours of Sunday, December 20. The often bubbly, free-spirited actress appeared in films such as ""Clueless,"" ""8 Mile,"" ""Don't Say a Word"" and ""Girl, Interrupted."" She also lent her voice to animated works, including the movie ""Happy Feet"" -- in which she also sang -- and a regular voice role on the animated TV series ""King of the Hill."" Murphy was best-known for her work in a string of comedies earlier this decade, including playing lead roles in ""Uptown Girls"" alongside fellow Georgia native Dakota Fanning and ""Little Black Book"" with Holly Hunter and Kathy Bates. She is survived by her husband. CNN's Jim Roope and Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.","Actress Brittany Murphy was found dead in her home December 20 .

"(CNN) -- Brian David Mitchell, the homeless street preacher who abducted, raped and kept a 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart captive for nine months, was sentenced to life in prison Wednesday. ""We believe it is an appropriate, just and long overdue result for our community, for the Smart family and of course, most importantly, Elizabeth,"" said Carlie Christensen, U.S. Attorney for Utah. U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball issued the sentence Wednesday. A jury found Mitchell guilty in December of Smart's 2002 kidnapping. ""Mitchell's heinous conduct, the evidence of his propensity to reoffend mandated such a sentence,"" Christensen said. Beaming before a group of reporters gathered outside the federal courthouse, Smart, now 23, said she was ""thrilled"" with the sentence -- the maximum allowable under the law. ""As I said during court, and I'll say it again now, I absolutely 100% believe that Brian David Mitchell knew exactly what he was doing when he kidnapped me, and all the events that followed. ... Today is the ending of a very long chapter, and the beginning of a very beautiful chapter for me,"" she said. Wednesday's sentencing occurred nearly nine years after Smart was abducted. ""This case demonstrates that the road to justice can be painstakingly long and emotional,"" James McTighe, the FBI special agent in charge of the case, said after the sentencing. ""However, this case also demonstrates that justice will be served no matter how many days, months or years it may take."" Smart testified for three days during Mitchell's more than four-week trial. ""I felt that because of what he had done to me, I was marked,"" she said during her testimony. ""I wasn't the same. My personal value had dropped. I was nothing. Another person could never love me."" She testified that she awoke to find a man holding a cold steel blade to her neck on June 5, 2002. She was taken from her bed and marched up a rugged mountain path in her red silk pajamas. When they reached Mitchell's remote camp, Smart testified she was ""sealed"" to her captor in a marriage ceremony, raped and shackled between two trees with a metal cable. She said she was degraded and treated ""like an animal."" Smart said she was raped nearly every day during nine months in captivity and forced to drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes and watch Mitchell have sex with his legal wife, Wanda Barzee. She was forced to wear robes and a veil in public and was not permitted to speak to other people. She said she feared Mitchell would act on his threats to kill her and her family if she did. She said Mitchell told her their marriage was preordained and that she would be by his side as he took seven times seven wives and successfully battled the Antichrist. They would hold exalted positions in God's new kingdom, she was told. Smart told reporters Wednesday that she was determined to dedicate her life to child advocacy, ""to help stop and prevent future kidnapping crimes, sexual crimes against children, against anyone."" She noted that the sentencing also occurred on National Missing Children's Day. Her father, standing beside her, held up posters depicting several children who were recently abducted. ""I think one of the biggest ways to overcome any trial in life, to heal from any kind of experience, is by helping those around you, because by lifting those around you up, you end up lifting yourself up as well,"" Smart said.","NEW: Smart says she is ""thrilled"" and pledges to dedicate her life to advocacy .

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration announced new standards for commercial pilot training Tuesday, with Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx calling it a ""significant advancement for aviation safety and pilot training."" The new rules from DOT and the Federal Aviation Administration will reinforce ground and flight training on aerodynamic stall and ""upset,"" enabling pilots to prevent and recover from potential disaster. The emphasis will be on pilots gaining experience on handling a stall during simulator training. During an aerodynamic stall, the plane loses its lift. If the pilot doesn't correct it, the plane may crash. That is what investigators say led to the 2009 Colgan Air Flight 3407 crash near Buffalo, New York. The pilots did not recognize the plane was slowing down too quickly, investigators said. When confronted with signs that the Colgan Air plane was entering an aerodynamic stall, the pilot pulled on the plane's control column when he should have pushed -- a simple error that led to the death of 50 people, according to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Investigators said the pilots were not adequately trained to handle stalls. The new pilot training standard not only calls for teaching pilots how to react and prevent aerodynamic stalls. It also mandates expanded training on how to handle crosswinds, wind gusts, enhanced runway safety procedures and more effective pilot monitoring. NTSB board members said they were struck by the amount of conversation between the Colgan Air captain and first officer, saying it was ""almost continuous."" By continuously conversing, the crew ""squandered time and their attention"" -- resources that should have been spent gaining awareness of their surroundings and preventing errors, according to the NTSB. The crash prompted Congress to order new rule changes and update regulations. Families of Colgan crash victims pushed hard for lawmakers to act. ""One of my first meetings as transportation secretary was with the Colgan Flight 3407 families, and today, I am proud to announce that with their help, the FAA has now added improved pilot training to its many other efforts to strengthen aviation safety,"" said Foxx. Tuesday's new pilot training rule addresses a congressional mandate in the Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010 to ensure enhanced pilot training. It is the third of significant rulings required by the act, including increased qualification requirements for first officers who fly U.S. passenger and cargo planes issued in July 2013. The FAA mandated that pilots will need more cockpit training to become fully certified first officers for U.S. passenger and cargo airlines. Co-pilots must complete 1,500 hours' total time as a pilot under the new rules, which took effect August 1. Previously, first officers were required to have only a commercial pilot certificate, which requires 250 hours of flight time. The rule also requires first officers to undergo new training and testing specifics to the planes they fly. In December 2011, final rules to prevent pilot fatigue were finalized. The sweeping pilot fatigue rule governs how much time off commercial passenger pilots must have between work shifts, ensuring they have a longer opportunity for rest before they enter the cockpit. It sets a 10-hour minimum rest period prior to a flight duty period, a two-hour increase over the old rules. The new rule also mandates that a pilot must have an opportunity for eight hours of uninterrupted sleep within the 10-hour rest period. FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at Tuesday's announcement this is the first fundamental rewrite of pilot training requirements in two decades. Air carriers will have five years to comply with the rule's new pilot training provisions, which the agencies say will allow time for the necessary software updates to be made in flight simulation technology.

"London (CNN) -- A new TV appeal for information about the disappearance of 3-year-old Madeleine McCann in 2007 has prompted almost 1,000 responses, London's Metropolitan Police said Tuesday. The appeal is based on a new investigation and was aired on the BBC's ""Crimewatch"" program on Monday. For six years, mystery has surrounded Madeleine's disappearance from her family's holiday villa in the resort town of Praia da Luz, in Portugal. Now a review of the evidence by a team from London's Metropolitan Police appears to have raised the prospect of fresh leads. The police have received more than 730 calls and and 212 e-mails since the appeal was broadcast, the case's lead investigator, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, said Tuesday. ""Detectives are now trawling through and prioritizing that material. This will take time,"" he said in a news release. Madeleine McCann case: Two callers name man in new UK police sketches . Callers give name for man in sketch . Police said Monday that two separate people had come up with the same name in response to computer-generated sketches of a man whom they are working to identify in connection with Madeleine's disappearance. The man is described as white, between 20 and 40 years old, with short brown hair and a medium build. He was seen carrying a blond child, who might have been in pajamas and who was estimated to be 3 to 4 years old, around the time Madeleine disappeared, police said. The two sketches, which police believe to be of the same man, are based on descriptions from separate witnesses, investigators said. The same police appeal is to be screened in Holland on Tuesday and Germany on Wednesday in the hope of flushing out new information. The Portuguese resort is popular with people of many different nationalities. Police target 38 'people of interest' in Madeleine McCann's '07 disappearance . The latest revelation is critical in reconstructing what exactly happened on the night of May 3, 2007, when Madeleine disappeared from her family's villa while her parents dined at a nearby restaurant. The girl was just days shy of her fourth birthday. Neither her parents nor the detectives investigating her case have given up on one day finding the little girl from Leicestershire, England. ""There may be an entirely innocent explanation of this man, but we need to establish who he is to assist with our inquiries,"" Redwood said earlier. Additionally, investigators believe they have a better understanding of when Madeleine may have been abducted, Redwood added. ""The timeline we have now established has given new significance to sightings and movements of people in and around Praia da Luz at the time of Madeleine's disappearance."" John Walsh: Madeleine McCann could be alive . More sketches released . As police sift through the evidence, they have also released sketches of a fair-haired man or men seen near the scene on or around May 3, 2007, whom they would like to trace. The detectives are investigating a spike in break-ins in the area in the weeks before Madeleine disappeared, two of them in the same block where her family was staying. Police also said Monday they are looking into four separate sightings of charity collectors on May 3 in Praia da Luz. Two additional sketches were released of men described as Portuguese or Portuguese-looking. The Metropolitan Police Service is offering a reward of up to Â£20,000 ($32,000) for information leading to the identification, arrest and prosecution of whomever is responsible for Madeleine's abduction. Meanwhile, her parents continue to hold on to hope that their daughter will be returned to them, explaining on their website: ""We still worry about her, we miss her as much as we ever did, we remain as determined as ever to find her and to know what has happened.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Despite sweeping reform of food safety laws intended to make what we eat less dangerous, the number of Americans falling ill or dying from contaminated food has increased 44% since last year, according to a report released Wednesday. Tainted cantaloupe, unsafe mangoes, meat and the recent peanut butter recall -- which so far has infected 25 people, mostly children, in 19 states -- has left consumers struggling to keep up with the dizzying list of ever-changing toxic edibles. Approximately 48 million people get sick from eating tainted food each year, the report's authors, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group said, arguing more must be done to protect Americans from unsafe food. The report says there were 718 illnesses directly linked to food recalls in 2011. There were 1,035 illnesses from January to September 2012 -- an increase of 44%. Multistate beef recall tied to potential E. coli contamination . Two years ago, President Barack Obama signed into law the Food Safety Modernization Act, a vast piece of legislation giving the Food and Drug Administration, among other things, more power to be proactive holding food suppliers responsible for foodborne illness outbreaks. But while some parts of the law have been enacted, the vast majority of the law's regulatory framework remains in limbo, sitting in the White House Office of Management and Budget, with no clear timetable for implementation. When asked about the delays, OMB spokeswoman Moira Mack told CNN, ""We have taken key steps, including putting out a food safety rule cracking down on salmonella in eggs and expanding E. coli testing for beef. We are working as expeditiously as possible to implement the food safety legislation we fought so hard for. When it comes to rules with this degree of importance and complexity, it is critical that we get it right."" The report also takes issue with the delayed response and plans in Congress to cut FDA funding. ""In February, the president's budget requested $4.5 billion for the Food and Drug Administration. But budget proposals in both the Senate and the House fall below this target, coming in $600 (million) to $700 million below full funding, which the Office of Management and Budget has called 'harmful' to food safety regulations,"" the Public Interest Research Group says. Kellog's recalls Mini-Wheats . The group's report also says the FDA hasn't been able to keep up with increased demands for inspection of imported foods. Nearly 15% of food consumed in the United States is imported, and the FDA's own data indicates two-thirds of the fruits and vegetables on American's dinner plates are from foreign food suppliers. Yet in 2008 the FDA inspected only 153 of roughly 189,000 registered foreign food facilities. Peanut, nut butter recall expanded . Instead of improving, the problem of foodborne outbreaks is getting worse, the report says. ""When comparing 2010 infection incidences with national health objective targets ... the only incidence rate that meets the target goal was the incidence of infection with E. coli O157,"" the report says. ""The incidence of salmonella was three times the 2010 national health objective target, which is especially alarming, as salmonella causes the majority of hospitalizations and deaths from foodborne disease."" The report argues the FDA needs to be provided with funding, develop concrete and specific standards for inspection at all facilities, perform more unannounced inspections, coordinate with other agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and put more resources toward monitoring the causes of foodborne illness. Popcorn recalled due to possible Listeria contamination . For its part, the FDA told CNN, ""The rule-making process can take time, and we are working diligently to get this right. We are confident the end result will be a solid framework to strengthen and modernize our nation's food safety system."" The Public Interest Research Group's report joins a growing chorus of food safety advocates demanding increased scrutiny of the U.S. food supply and those calling for complete implementation of the Food Safety Modernization Act. The group helped design the framework for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the federal agency created to regulate the banking industry's consumer marketing tactics. Whether Wednesday's scathing report will lead to similar results remains to be seen.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A federal judge in Georgia has been arrested on drug and weapons charges after federal agents say he bought drugs for a stripper with whom he was having an affair. Senior U.S. District Judge Jack Camp Jr. has been charged with possession of cocaine, marijuana and the painkiller roxicodone, according to court documents. He is also charged with possessing a firearm as an unlawful user of controlled substances and with aiding and abetting the possession of drugs by the stripper, who had a prior drug conviction. Camp was arrested Friday after federal agents said he bought drugs from an undercover agent. He made an initial appearance Monday in a federal court in Atlanta and was released on $50,000 bond. The charges allege that Camp had been paying the stripper for sex since the past spring and was fronting money to buy drugs for both of them. Before the sting that led to his arrest, he told her, ""Let me pay him, because you've already got a record,"" the affidavit states. Camp, 67, is the former chief judge for the Northern District of Georgia. He was appointed to the bench by President Ronald Reagan in 1987 and took senior status in 2008. His lead attorney, Bill Morrison, would not discuss the facts of the case but played down his client's public office. ""This is really a case between Judge Camp and his wife,"" Morrison told reporters outside the Atlanta federal courthouse. ""It's not a case of Judge Camp being a judge, it's a case of Judge Camp being a husband."" Tuesday, Morrison stressed his client's case has not been presented to a grand jury. ""If there is an indictment, then the next step after that will be a hearing,"" he said. A Justice Department spokeswoman confirmed the next court appearance in the case has not yet been scheduled. The dancer, who is not identified in court papers, had a prior drug-related federal felony conviction on her record and ""recently began cooperating with the FBI,"" according to the charges -- but she began recording the judge before she became an informant, the affidavit states. The woman has been promised immunity from prosecution, but also had fewer tapes than she originally told agents from other law enforcement agencies, according to a footnote in the court papers. During the deal that led to his arrest, Camp carried at least two pistols, his arrest affidavit states. According to the paperwork, it was one of at least three transactions in which he was armed. ""I'll watch your back anytime 'cause I'm afraid, and I not only have my little pistol, I've got my big pistol,"" the affidavit quotes Camp as telling the woman beforehand. ""So, uh, we'll take care of any problems that come up."" They took separate cars to the meeting, which took place in the parking lot of a suburban Atlanta nightclub. According to the affidavit, Camp pocketed the drugs and told the undercover agent, ""We'll call you again.""","NEW: Attorney and Justice Department official say a court appearance is not set .

"(CNN) -- Neil Armstrong, the American astronaut who made ""one giant leap for mankind"" when he became the first man to walk on the moon, died Saturday. He was 82. ""We are heartbroken to share the news that Neil Armstrong has passed away following complications resulting from cardiovascular procedures,"" Armstrong's family said in a statement. Armstrong underwent heart surgery this month. ""While we mourn the loss of a very good man, we also celebrate his remarkable life and hope that it serves as an example to young people around the world to work hard to make their dreams come true, to be willing to explore and push the limits, and to selflessly serve a cause greater than themselves,"" his family said. Armstrong gives rare interview to Australian accountant . Armstrong died Saturday in Cincinnati, Ohio, according to a NASA spokesman. The agency's administrator put the death in perspective. ""As long as there are history books, Neil Armstrong will be included in them,"" said Charles Bolden. ""As we enter this next era of space exploration, we do so standing on the shoulders of Neil Armstrong. We mourn the passing of a friend, fellow astronaut and true American hero."" Armstrong took two trips into space. He made his first journey in 1966 as commander of the Gemini 8 mission, which nearly ended in disaster. Armstrong kept his cool and brought the spacecraft home safely after a thruster rocket malfunctioned and caused it to spin wildly out of control. During his next space trip in July 1969, Armstrong and fellow astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins blasted off in Apollo 11 on a nearly 250,000-mile journey to the moon that went down in the history books. It took them four days to reach their destination. Time: Life up close with Apollo 11 . The world watched and waited as the lunar module ""Eagle"" separated from the command module and began its descent. Then came the words from Armstrong: ""Tranquility Base here, the Eagle has landed."" About six and a half hours later at 10:56 p.m. ET on July 20, 1969, Armstrong, at age 38, became the first person to set foot on the moon. He uttered the now-famous phrase: ""That's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind."" The quote was originally recorded without the ""a,"" which was picked up by voice recognition software many years later. Armstrong was on the moon's surface for two hours and 32 minutes and Aldrin, who followed him, spent about 15 minutes less than that. The two astronauts set up an American flag, scooped up moon rocks and set up scientific experiments before returning to the main spacecraft. All three returned home to a hero's welcome, and none ever returned to space. The moon landing was a major victory for the United States, which at the height of the Cold War in 1961 committed itself to landing a man on the moon and returning him safely before the decade was out. It was also a defining moment for the world. The launch and landing were broadcast on live TV and countless people watched in amazement as Armstrong walked on the moon. ""I remember very clearly being an 8-year-old kid and watching the TV ... I remember even as a kid thinking, 'Wow, the world just changed,'"" said astronaut Leroy Chiao. ""And then hours later watching Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin take the very first step of any humans on another planetary body. That kind of flipped the switch for me in my head. I said, 'That's what I want to do, I want to be an astronaut.'"" Tributes to Armstrong -- who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969, the highest award offered to a U.S. civilian -- poured in as word of his death spread. The untold story of Apollo 11 . ""Neil was among the greatest of American heroes -- not just of his time, but of all time,"" said President Barack Obama. ""When he and his fellow crew members lifted off aboard Apollo 11 in 1969, they carried with them the aspirations of an entire nation. They set out to show the world that the American spirit can see beyond what seems unimaginable -- that with enough drive and ingenuity, anything is possible."" Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said the former astronaut ""today takes his place in the hall of heroes. With courage unmeasured and unbounded love for his country, he walked where man had never walked before. The moon will miss its first son of earth."" House Speaker John Boehner, from Ohio, said: ""A true hero has returned to the Heavens to which he once flew. Neil Armstrong blazed trails not just for America, but for all of mankind. He inspired generations of boys and girls worldwide not just through his monumental feat, but with the humility and grace with which he carried himself to the end."" Armstrong was born in Wapakoneta, Ohio, on August 5, 1930. He was interested in flying even as a young boy, earning his pilot's license at age 16. Armstrong's one small step resonated for all mankind . Armstrong studied aeronautical engineering and earned degrees from Purdue University and University of Southern California. He served in the Navy, and flew 78 combat missions during the Korean War. ""He was the best, and I will miss him terribly,"" said Collins, the Apollo 11 command module pilot. After his historic mission to the moon, Armstrong worked for NASA, coordinating and managing the administration's research and technology work. In 1971, he resigned from NASA and taught engineering at the University of Cincinnati for nearly a decade. While many people are quick to cash in on their 15 minutes of fame, Armstrong largely avoided the public spotlight and chose to lead a quiet, private life with his wife and children. ""He was really an engineer's engineer -- a modest man who was always uncomfortable in his singular role as the first person to set foot on the moon. He understood and appreciated the historic consequences of it and yet was never fully willing to embrace it. He was modest to the point of reclusive. You could call him the J.D. Salinger of the astronaut corps,"" said Miles O'Brien, an aviation expert with PBS' Newshour, formerly of CNN. ""He was a quiet, engaging, wonderful from the Midwest kind of guy. ... But when it came to the public exposure that was associated with this amazing accomplishment ... he ran from it. And part of it was he felt as if this was an accomplishment of many thousands of people. And it was. He took the lion's share of the credit and he felt uncomfortable with that,"" said O'Brien. But Armstrong always recognized -- in a humble manner -- the importance of what he had accomplished. ""Looking back, we were really very privileged to live in that thin slice of history where we changed how man looks at himself and what he might become and where he might go,"" Armstrong said.

"(CNN) -- Google began an ambitious project in 2004: to scan and index the world's paper books and make them searchable online. Nine years later, the company has overcome a major roadblock in its mission. On Thursday, a judge dismissed a class-action lawsuit against the Google Books project brought by authors who claimed the project violated their copyrights. By sheer numbers, the Google Books project has been a huge success. More than 20 million books and magazines have been scanned using optical character-recognition technology, making each word or phrase searchable, so snippets of text are part of Google search results. It also has been a lightning rod for controversy. Google did not seek approval to scan many books that were still under copyright, nor did it offer to compensate authors or publishers in any way, claiming the scans were fair use. The program doesn't put entire books online for free. If a book is still under copyright, search results will only show the brief section that includes the word or phrase searched for and the page number it appears on, along with details about the book itself. Google compares the system to a card catalog. Books that are out of copyright can be viewed in full and even downloaded, and people can buy books whose authors or publishers are part of Google's Partner Program. ""As we have long said, Google Books is in compliance with copyright law and acts like a card catalog for the digital age, giving users the ability to find books to buy or borrow,"" said a Google spokesperson. Because the company only shows ""snippets"" of the books in search results, it claims the project falls under fair use. Fair use is an exception to copyright law that allows copyrighted work to be sampled or used in certain circumstances, typically by altering or using the original work in a new ""transformative"" way. ""The use of book text to facilitate search through the display of snippets is transformative,"" Judge Denny Chin said in his ruling. He said the Google Books program provided benefits to the public. ""It advances the progress of the arts and sciences, while maintaining respectful consideration for the rights of authors and other creative individuals, and without adversely impacting the rights of copyright holders,"" said Chin. Opinion: Why I took on Google over orgy images . The ruling notes that the majority of the books scanned are out of print, and that Google provided digital copies to the libraries that allowed them to scan their collections. The books scanned are also primarily nonfiction titles, which have less copyright protection than fiction. The Google database is used by researchers, librarians and educators and greatly expands access to books around the world by putting them online. By converting print to digital text, the program has also made it easier to convert titles into more accessible formats, like text-to-speech and Braille. ""This has been a long road and we are absolutely delighted with today's judgment,"" said the Google spokesperson.

"(CNN) -- When it comes to health care, Americans disagree about much, but we do agree that our $2.7-trillion-a-year health care system is broken. Although fixing the system will be difficult, there is one inexpensive, readily available, and highly effective way to prevent illness while drastically reducing skyrocketing health care costs: Let's help each other exercise more. In fact, it's what we evolved to do. The essential role of physical activity in promoting health has deep evolutionary roots. Prior to a few hundred generations ago, our ancestors were hunter-gatherers who trekked at least five miles every day as well as ran, dug, climbed, and did all their work by hand. Although the origin of agriculture transformed our diets, farmers also had to toil long, hard hours. Until recently, all of us were athletes. Today, most Americans seldom, if ever, have to do much physical work. Cars, elevators, escalators, shopping carts, and other labor-saving innovations allow us to exist for days without ever significantly elevating our heart rates or breaking a sweat. Few jobs require physical activity and most of us have little inclination to exercise in our spare time. As a result, a majority of Americans fail to meet the Surgeon General's recommendation to exercise at least 150 minutes per week. Being physically inactive is not only abnormal, it is also pathological, because the old adage ""use it or lose it"" is really true. Our bodies evolved to require the stresses inherent in physical activity to grow and function properly, and our bodies never evolved to cope with persistent inactivity. Moderate exercise is vital for developing a strong and healthy circulatory system, durable bones safe from osteoporosis, a vigorous immune system, a properly functioning brain and more. Almost every organ and body system benefits from regular exercise and is compromised by its absence. How to fix health problems with exercise . No health problem illustrates the benefits of exercise more acutely than heart disease, which afflicts more than 15 million Americans and is our nation's leading cause of death. Yet of all the diseases we face, heart disease is one of the most preventable and treatable through exercise. Men who are unfit but then improve their fitness lower their rate of death from heart disease by about 50%, research shows. Because treating a patient with heart disease costs more than $20,000 extra per year, we could save almost $40 billion a year by getting just 25% more Americans to exercise moderately. Those savings are actually a big underestimate, since studies show physical activity also substantially reduces the prevalence and severity of many other costly diseases, including Alzheimer's, breast cancer and colon cancer. To be sure, exercise is not a panacea. Regular physical activity does not guarantee good health, and it has only limited effects on weight loss. Yet, even though exercise won't solve the obesity epidemic, it confers so many health benefits regardless of one's weight, the question we should ask is not whether more Americans should exercise, but how can we help them do it? Again, the human body's evolutionary story provides useful answers. We evolved to be physically active not because we wanted to but because we were obliged to. Our Stone Age ancestors who struggled to survive had no alternative to being active for many hours a day, but they also benefited from taking it easy whenever possible to avoid wasting scarce energy. Even though cars, elevators and shopping carts are recent inventions, the instincts to use them are ancient and powerful. As a result, we need motivation to exercise. Would you like 2 hours of exercise with that? How can we help each other exercise? In the case of children, exercise needs to be fun, playful, and as much a daily priority as brushing one's teeth and getting enough sleep. It also needs to be mandatory. Just as we mandate car seats for children and prohibit minors from purchasing alcohol and tobacco, we need to implement regular, meaningful levels of fitness-based physical activity in school. By failing to do so adequately, we are robbing millions of children of healthy futures, and we are guaranteeing enormous future medical bills. What about adults? Although adults have the right to be inactive, most of us wish otherwise but we require nudges from friends, families, health care providers, businesses, and other social institutions, including government. On the local level, we need communities to promote non-motorized transportation and to encourage fitness activities like walking, cycling, jogging, and soccer. Businesses, both large and small, need financial incentives to encourage employees to exercise and to build the infrastructure necessary for people to do so safely and conveniently. Doctors, health care providers, and insurers should be rewarded for helping patients become more active. In short, promoting fitness has to become a collective responsibility. Can we do this? If history is any guide, the answer is yes. Through collective action over the last 50 years, we decreased by 50% the number of Americans who smoke, as well as the number of Americans who die in motor vehicle accidents. Have you quit smoking? Share your story . Finally, can we afford not to become more active? Because of many advances, Americans no longer need to be physically active to survive on a day-to-day basis, but our Stone Age bodies still require exercise to thrive as we age. For the sake of our bodies, our economy, and our country, the consequences of inaction are too great to accept. Why Americans are dying earlier than their international peers . See Daniel Lieberman and Dr. Sanjay Gupta show how anyone can run faster and longer with less effort on ""Sanjay Gupta M.D.,"" Saturday at 4:30 p.m. and Sunday at 7:30 a.m.","Exercising for health has deep evolutionary roots .

"(CNN) -- Michigan and federal authorities will coordinate their criminal investigations into a deadly fungal meningitis outbreak that killed 22 people in that state and 64 people total nationwide, the Michigan attorney general and the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts said Monday in Detroit. However, Michigan -- which had the most deaths of any single state in the 2012 outbreak -- will let its own grand jury in the case take a ""temporary pause"" in the probe of the Massachusetts-based New England Compounding Center, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette said. The Michigan grand jury hasn't announced any indictments and its six-month term is set to expire soon, though a judge could call it back, Schuette said. He emphasized his agreement with the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, Carmen Ortiz, saying it will ensure state investigators see the evidence that a federal grand jury in Boston is seeing, and vice versa. ""This will help us reach our mutual goal: to secure justice for victims of fungal meningitis,"" Schuette said. ""... By working together we can ensure our investigative efforts are not duplicated."" The outbreak, thought to be caused by tainted steroid injections from the New England Compounding Center, infected 751 people in 20 states last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. More than 260 of the infected were Michigan citizens, Schuette said. Massachusetts cracks down on compounding pharmacies . The company filed for bankruptcy last December. A state pharmacy board also voted to permanently revoke the company's license to operate as well as the licenses of the company's three principal pharmacists. No one has yet been charged in the case, said Ortiz, who appeared with Schuette at a news conference in Detroit Monday morning. She declined to discuss details of the investigation, but said she is confident in the direction it is going. Symptoms of fungal meningitis can include headache, fever, nausea, stiff neck, new weakness or numbness anywhere in the body, slurred speech, pain or swelling at the injection site and sensitivity to light, according to the CDC. What is a compounding pharmacy? Compounding pharmacists customize medications to fit an individual's needs. Doctors prescribe these custom medications when the manufactured drug won't work -- for example, when a dosage is too large, or a patient has an allergy to a dye or ingredient in the commonly available product. 8th case of meningitis confirmed at Princeton .","NEW: Michigan, Massachusetts investigators will see each other's info in outbreak probe .

"Prague, Czech Republic (CNN)  -- How do you see the popular uprising sweeping the Middle East and North Africa? It's an epoch-making event. We don't know what it will lead to, how it will finish up. But there is one thing I find very interesting -- there are thousands of experts at ministries, at universities, in science institutes, who specialize in the Arab world. Not one of them predicted that this would happen. More than 10 countries are now experiencing this revolt. There are many similarities with the fall of the Iron Curtain in Europe, but also many ""dissimilarities."" There is one thing I would add -- in the countries where it's impossible to do a free poll, it's hard to see what is happening below the surface. I remember that Western journalists were telling us for years: You charter-signers and dissidents are Don Quixotes. You are not supported by the working class or farmers or some serious political power. What kind of sense do you think it makes? I was saying: ""Be careful. Be careful. What do you know about what's happening under the surface of the society?"" Those are the things which someone, especially coming from the free world, would never expect to be happening. And all of a sudden, it explodes somewhere, it's contagious, hitting other countries. And that's similar to what was happening here 20 years ago. How could the experts get it so wrong? For example Gadhafi -- everybody knew he's a fool, a clown, a ridiculous figure. But nobody said he's a madman and a criminal. He had to start murdering his own nation and forbidding the removal of dead bodies from the streets before something which should have been known was finally recognized. Is it because Gadhafi had oil resources? That's another thing which plays an important role, of course. And as long as the economic interests will be superior to human interests and the interests of human rights, the development of this civilization won't be good. But that's generally a problem of civilization. It's not just about Gadhafi. What ignites this human passion for freedom? It's the snowball principle. Totally marginal thing starts rolling, wrapping up many other layers and eventually it leads to something nobody awaited, expected, or predicted. But what is also sleeping under the surface and is invisible is a longing for certain elementary freedoms and that doesn't usually break out just like that, by itself. The snowball is created, it's rolling and rolling and, very often, it turns into an avalanche. But this avalanche doesn't start just by itself. What kind of person should they choose to lead them? There are certainly enough people in all those Arab countries which long for democracy. They are fighting for democracy, for freedom, for human rights, but they still haven't had a chance to express themselves. They will be probably positioning themselves very quickly according to the new situation and there will be partners. Today, it's harder for the free world than during our times because there are no similar dissident organizations or structures, though there are also some hints of that as well in all of those countries. But there are no alternative powers in position, so they have to get in positioned very quickly. So the situation is naturally harder for the Western world, because they don't really know whom to contact or support. The whole [1989] revolutionary movement was made easier thanks to some kinds of alternative structures. It was not just people accidentally passing through Wenceslas Square who went on the balcony there. And a long time before that, many years before that, we were taken as partners, up to a certain degree. That means it was easier than it is now, where the partnerships are forming and taking shape. I think the leaders can't come from the political sphere, because any political opponent was murdered a long time ago, suppressed, chased out of the country and so on. People from other professions must become politicians quickly, overnight. That's something what we have experienced. I believe that the younger generation, students, etc. will offer, will create, and will form such personalities. Five days is enough. In the modern media era, a few days is enough so that a person becomes generally known and viewed as someone who really cares about freeing people, about democracy. What are your concerns for these uprisings now? I was following all those events very closely, especially in Egypt. And I was longing very much for a quick end, because I know that the longer it lasts, the more violence appears. And in Libya, it has been lasting a long time and it turned into a fratricidal war. The faster the process of change, the fewer victims there are. By some political instinct, it's necessary to estimate a certain point when it should culminate and end. To drag it out brings many new dangers. And it's not only a question of numbers, that there are more victims over more days, but it's also becoming worse in other ways. Freed prisoners become a part of it, become thieves [for example]. If the people of the Middle East want real democracy, where must they keep their focus? I wouldn't like to play the role of an advisor to Arab countries. I think it's also important to respect the cultural differences, differences of traditions. But in the Arab world, like in any other civilization, there exist certain basic values, some common, shared, moral and political minimum which is necessary to defend. And it works like this: the world has to go through big shake-ups so it can recover its freedom. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was created after World War II. It could hardly have been created later. It's a question of whether another movement toward deepening human freedoms will demand another such catastrophe or if it will be possible without it. How difficult is it going to be for them to build the institutions of a democracy? First of all, let's realize that these countries haven't actually experienced democracy. They don't have the tradition which the central European countries had had at least a little of. That makes it harder. But of course it requires creation of a whole institutional system. Perhaps more important than whether we have a one or two-chamber parliament, more important than the institutional aspect is the political culture -- a certain spirit of the institutions, I would say. That's a problem still until today, even here, even though it has been 20 years since our big political change. There is a struggle between those who are called spiritualists, who talk about the spirit of institutions, mechanisms, elections and so on, and those who are defenders of legal positivism, formalists, who are betting on the institutions as such. Are the countries that saw revolutionary change in 1989, are some of them backsliding now? I think that the authoritarian elements that we can observe in Russia and in a much worse way in Belarus and now in a certain way in Ukraine are of a different nature than the pure totalitarian system as we remember it. They are different because they are more sophisticated and are motivated by economic interests. It's a dictatorship in gloves. But it is also necessary to come to terms with this. I would say it's a typical post-communist phenomenon. What do you hope is your personal legacy? I would be glad if it was felt that I have done something generally useful. I don't care much about personal fame or popularity. I would be satisfied with the feeling that I had a chance to help with something in general, something good. That history gave me that chance.","Former Czech Vaclav Havel helped lay foundations for democracy in eastern Europe .

"(CNN) -- Irish singer Sinead O'Connor's open letter to Miley Cyrus in which she urged the 20-year-old not to allow herself ""to be pimped"" by the music industry certainly got our attention. It seems to have gotten Cyrus' attention, as well, because the former Disney star, who has dominated the headlines recently following her controversial awards show twerking and nude performance in a music video, took to Twitter to respond. In a tweet, she compared O'Connor to troubled star Amanda Bynes, and she included a Twitter feed of O'Connor's from the past when she wrote about struggling with and seeking help for mental health issues. The Sinead O'Connor and Miley feud isn't over . O'Connor fired back, threatening Cyrus with legal action if the Twitter feed was not removed, accusing her of mocking people with mental health issues and questioning where she's getting her direction. ""Who the (expletive) is advising you?"" O'Connor wrote on her Facebook page. ""Because taking me on is even more (expletive) stupid than behaving like a prostitute and calling it feminism."" Outraged parents: Why Miley Cyrus' performance sets girls, women back . Moving beyond the O'Connor-Cyrus public feud, we wanted to know what women across the country thought about O'Connor's direct message to Cyrus, and whether it might have any impact on the larger conversation about how our girls are sexualized at younger and younger ages. In conversations and in exchanges on Twitter and Facebook, we mainly heard from women who applauded O'Connor, although there were some who thought she missed the mark. We also found widespread agreement that much more needs to be done to battle the early sexualization that has become one of the top concerns for parents today. Gloria Feldt, a bestselling author and feminist leader, said her first reaction was to be non-plussed by O'Connor taking the time to reach out and give advice. ""She certainly has not been a perfect role model, but sometimes that's how you learn, and so when I thought about it again, I thought well, in some respects, who better to give a little voice of experience than someone who has been through that mill,"" said Feldt, who is now co-founder and president of an organization devoted to developing and encouraging women leaders called Take the Lead. ""I think 'Good for Sinead,' really in the end,"" she said. Billy Ray Cyrus on his daughter: 'That's still my Miley' Melissa Atkins Wardy, co-founder of a new advocacy group focusing on the portrayal of girls in media called Brave Girls Alliance, believes O'Connor's letter ""was really needed."" ""I don't think that Miley has people on her team that are guiding her in a way that is in her best interest,"" said Atkins Wardy, whose book, ""Redefining Girly: How Parents Can Fight the Stereotyping and Sexualizing of Girlhood, Birth to Tween,"" will be released in January. ""She can't be Hannah Montana forever, but at the same time ... does an artist bear a responsibility to her fans? I think that's kind of what Sinead was saying, in that, if you prostitute yourself to the music industry, they're just going to eat you up and spit you up and get the next new girl off the train who is five years younger than you and willing to go farther than you,"" she said. Nicole, a single woman who works in advertising and who only wanted to use her first name, said she hopes Cyrus takes O'Connor's advice seriously. Too hot for tweens: Why some parents dread back-to-school shopping . In response to a request for comment on CNN's Facebook page, she said, ""Young women need to know that talent, not our bodies, should carry us through our lives and be the root of our successes and in some cases, our failures ... Women need to be empowered not devalued."" Dannie Cade, also in response to a request for comment on CNN's Facebook page, said, ""I think every woman, and I mean EVERY woman, should read this letter regardless of the strong language that was used ... No matter what industry, career or talents a woman chooses in her life, Sinead's letter applies."" On the other hand, some thought O'Connor was out of line. ""I hate it when women tell other women what to do under the guise of 'Don't let anyone tell you what to do,'"" one tweet said. ""Sinead's of course entitled to her opinion but, from what I've read of Miley's thinking on things, I believe she's quite in control of what she will and will not do and why,"" another reader said on CNN's Facebook page. ""She's in the entertainment business. Business as usual won't get you noticed and will kill a career more certainly than pissing people off."" Feminists like Erin Matson, editor at large for RH Reality Check, a daily publication focusing on sexual and reproductive health and justice issues, believe O'Connor ""missed the point."" ""There was a very good reason for her to write an open letter to Miley Cyrus about what she's doing, but the problem is not that Miley needs to put some clothes on. The problem is she's engaging in this racial power play,"" Matson said. Matson said Cyrus is relying on racial stereotypes and racial appropriation, citing her dancing with brown teddy bears, twerking and saying she wants to make music that ""sounds black."" ""What I object to is the practice of a young white woman taking sexual power by relying on racial stereotypes and racial appropriation,"" Matson said. Countdown for Kendall Jenner turning 18: Gross or fair game? As for the issue of hyper-sexualization of women in the music industry and in entertainment in general, Matson said it's the people behind the scenes who are responsible for it, not entertainers like Cyrus. ""Let's look at the producers, let's look at the advertisers, let's look at music television, let's look at all those people in charge who are by and large men,"" Matson said. ""It seems awfully curious to point our finger at a small number of women in power in the entertainment industry and say they're the problem when it's the people who are controlling the purse strings who are the problem."" Feldt says she has heard the it's-the-media-not-Miley debate, but she disagrees somewhat. She believes there is a role for Cyrus to play. ""How do you change the media if you don't start setting your own boundaries? And, no, you can't expect any one person to change an entire institution, but if each one of us doesn't use our best judgment, we'll never change,"" Feldt said. ""It's not just the responsibility of the individual, but if an individual has an opportunity to make an impact as a Miley Cyrus or a Sinead O'Connor does, she should take it,"" she added. Atkins Wardy's group is launching a campaign next week, renting a billboard in Times Square to showcase tweets on what changes in the media young girls and those who care about them want to see. She says it helps when celebrities like O'Connor lend their voices to the discussion about how girls and women are portrayed. ""So when we have celebrities and media members ... speaking out against this, it helps a little bit to give credibility because sometimes you are labeled as, 'Oh, you are a prude' or 'Oh, you are just a feminist that lacks a sense of humor or something,'"" Wardy said. ""But here are women who are part of the game and are actually saying the game's pretty sick.""

"(CNN) -- Gunmen on a motorbike killed a Russian military instructor and wounded a second Tuesday in Yemen's capital of Sanaa, two senior police officials said. They used silencers and needed only seconds for the attack, eyewitnesses said. ""We only realized when the two Russians were on the floor and a motorcycle was seen escaping the scene,"" said Saleh al-Matari. ""They escaped by using side streets and driving through residential areas."" Security forces arrived 10 minutes later, witnesses said. The wounded man was taken to a hospital, according to police. The two victims were advising Yemen's army as private security contractors, said the police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. They were walking out of their hotel when they were shot. The Russian Embassy would not confirm that the victims were Russian. Last month, a German security expert was shot dead as he walked out of a Sanaa supermarket. Yemen is the most impoverished country in the Middle East and is plagued by two major bloody conflicts. Shiite Houthi rebels have fought a separatist battle for years but recently came to a cease-fire agreement with the government of the majority Sunni nation. Last week, one of their representatives in Yemen's parliament was shot dead by gunmen on a motorcycle in Sanaa. Yemen is also a home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which many analysts believe is the most dangerous wing of the terrorist network. U.S. counterterrorism officials have said that AQAP strives to attack targets outside of Yemen. With the help of drone strikes allegedly carried out by the CIA, Yemen's military put militants in the country's tribal region on retreat last year, but AQAP regularly carries out terrorist attacks on soldiers and officials.","Witnesses said that they used silencers and needed only seconds for the attack .

"(CNN) -- Zhang Xin is an example of true grit success. She rose from the faceless assembly line of a Beijing factory to a property magnate richer than Donald Trump and Oprah. Her company, SOHO China, literally changed the landscape of Beijing and Shanghai over the past two decades. Forbes magazine has listed her family's net worth at $3.6 billion. And she's not stopping there. In a private transaction (not related to her company business), her family and the Safra banking family of Brazil just bought a 40% stake in the iconic GM building in New York City -- the building that houses the flagship Apple store on Fifth Avenue. Zhang recently sat down with CNN's Pauline Chiou to talk about everything from her Beijing childhood to the volatile property market and how her 14-year old son tried to get a job at McDonald's. Failure is part of the puzzle . CNN: Did you come across a lot of bumps in the road and a lot of failures? Zhang Xin: Every day. I mean, I think that's just life. You will always bump into difficulties, challenges and problems. It appears to be that we seem to be doing quite well, but as it is now, we're still having challenges every day. So I think that's just nothing unique. That's just life. Pivot and dribble around politics . CNN: You moved from residential real estate to commercial and now you're focusing on commercial. Why did you do that, especially when we see new home prices still rising? ZX: Residential development has become very political. Government policies ...are against any prices going up because this is a very social issue. The government comes out with policies that deal one day with this side [of the issue] another day with this side [of the issue]. We said, ""Let's get out of this area. Yeah, let's move on to somewhere we can really exercise our skills as a developer."" I think the policies are so distorted. Like someone who's sick, you've taken so much medicine that you've lost the sense of which one works and which one doesn't. That's a little bit like the real estate market in China. Grab the opportunities . CNN: On the Forbes' recent list of 24 self-made female billionaires, there are five women from China, one from Hong Kong. What is it about China and the women of your generation that allows them to achieve that highest level? ZX: Women of our generation went through the Cultural Revolution, went through hardship, went through coming from nowhere. Suddenly, we see China's been given so many amazing opportunities. So women just seized the opportunity. I think in terms of coming from a low base, coming from nowhere, we're all equal. In China, there are a lot of problems but also there are a lot of opportunities. Precisely because there are so many problems, things are not established; therefore, there are opportunities. Have a life outside of work . CNN: You're a mother of two boys. You're a wife. How do you do the work-life balance? ZX: I'm very, very focused on my children. In fact, I'm very religious about having breakfast with them every morning, having dinner with them every evening, and spend all the weekends with them that I don't work. So as long as I'm not traveling, I'm always with them and I go to their soccer and tennis matches. After dinner we'd just sit together and do homework with my children because they need help. I love doing that. It also makes me realize the world is so much wider than just your business world.","Worth $3.6 billion, Zhang Xin is the world's seventh richest self-made woman .

"London (CNN) -- Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has again opened the dispute over sovereignty of the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic, accusing the British government of blatant colonialism. Known to the Argentinians as Las Malvinas, the two countries went to war over the territory in 1982 after the then military government in Argentina landed troops on the islands. In an open letter to British Prime Minister David Cameron and published in British newspapers Thursday, the Argentinian leader said ""Britain, the colonial power, has refused to return the territories to the Argentine Republic, thus preventing it from restoring its territorial integrity."" The British government was swift to respond, insisting that there would be no discussions over sovereignty ""unless and until such as the time as the islanders so wish."" It is the latest in a recent series of incidents that has raised tensions between the two countries. What led to the latest dispute? The Argentinian president has raised the sovereignty issue several times over the last two years, including a claim at the U.N., but the dispute made global headlines when Prince William, second in line to the British throne, was deployed on a military mission to the islands in 2012. The UK also decided to dispatch the new warship HMS Dauntless to the Falklands -- a move that inflamed anger in Argentina which accused Britain of militarizing the South Atlantic. Tensions were raised again in December when the UK renamed a portion of the British Antarctic Territory as Queen Elizabeth Land in honor of the British head of state Queen Elizabeth II. Argentina also has a claim on some of the territory and lodged a protest with the British. Last year also saw a public confrontation between the two countries' leaders when Fernandez tried to hand a letter to Cameron at the G-20 summit -- a letter he refused to accept -- and there was more bad feeling between the nations ahead of the London 2012 Olympics when Argentina released a video boosting its Olympic team that was filmed on the islands. Where are the Falklands and why are they important? Located in the South Atlantic Ocean, about 480 kilometers east of the tip of South America, the windswept Falklands have long been coveted as a strategic shipping stopover and potential wellspring of natural resources. Their remoteness, however, exposed them to neglect and complex wrangling over ownership among British, French, Spanish and Argentinian interests. Argentina's forerunners formally declared possession in 1820, prompting Britain to reclaim a sovereignty it originally declared In 1765. Falklands conflict in photos . Despite regular challenges, notably in 1982, British control has endured and the Falklands' current population of about 3,000 looks to London to safeguard oil, fishing, farming and tourism incomes. What happened in 1982? Documents recently revealed under the UK's 30-year rule show that the British government was surprised by the Argentinian invasion of the islands on April 2, 1982, with the then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher describing it as ""the worst... moment of my life."" In evidence given to the Falkland Islands Review Committee in October 1982, and some months after the war ended, Thatcher said there were no warning signs from Argentina since its 1977 statement saying there would be talks. ""I never, never expected the Argentines to invade the Falklands head-on,"" she told the committee. ""It was such a stupid thing to do, as events happened, such a stupid thing even to contemplate doing."" The files also show that Thatcher's Cabinet was trying to pursue a diplomatic solution to the crisis through the help of then U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig, while also preparing a military response. British naval forces were dispatched after Argentinian President Leopoldo Galtieri's military dictatorship put troops on the Falklands. Soldiers fought land battles on the islands, aircraft were shot down and ships were attacked with significant losses of life -- most notably the Argentinian General Belgrano and Britain's HMS Sheffield, HMS Antelope and RFA Sir Galahad. Britain declared an end to fighting after 74 days and following the surrender of Argentinian troops. Argentina put its death toll at 645. Britain's civil and military losses amounted to 255. How did the United States and other world powers react? President Ronald Reagan's administration declared economic sanctions against Argentina. It also gave its Cold War ally a strategic edge by supplying potent Sidewinder missiles to counter Argentina's Exocets. At the height of the conflict, a meeting of the world's biggest economies -- including the UK, U.S., Germany, Italy, France, Japan and Canada -- backed Britain's position. Why won't the UK give up the islands like it did Hong Kong? Britain acknowledges its claim to the Falklands is disputed, but has made clear it has no intention of discussing the sovereignty issue with Argentina. Professor Clive Schofield, an expert in maritime territorial disputes at Australia's University of Wollongong, said last year that there was no comparison to Hong Kong, which Britain returned to Chinese control after expiry of a set lease in 1997. ""The UK position on the Falklands is that they are under British sovereignty -- they are not leased from anyone,"" he said. What has happened to the islands since the end of the war in 1982? Spurred by the conflict and stung by accusations of neglect, Britain began taking renewed economic interest in the Falklands. It protected fishing rights and asserted control over oil exploration licenses. It also stepped up its military interests, building a new airfield and bolstering naval, army and air force presences. Images of life in the Falklands . Cooperation between Britain and Argentina -- by now an established democracy whose militarist past has left current leaders distrustful of its armed forces -- has improved, but Buenos Aires continued to reject any territorial claim to Las Malvinas other than its own. The Falkland Islanders are due to hold a referendum on their political status on March 10/11, 2013. According to the Falklands legislative assembly, the vote is intended to affirm islanders' desire to remain a self-governing territory of the United Kingdom and to reject claims of ownership by Argentina. So why is the language between London and Buenos Aires so tense now? Analysts have previously pointed to Argentinian politicians seeking to divert voters from the pain caused by inflation and reduced subsidies on oil, gas and electricity. ""The government is being squeezed from lots of different areas, so one way to distract from the economic problems facing the country is to raise the Malvinas issue,"" Professor Mark Jones, an expert in Latin American politics at Rice University in Texas said last year. ""It's one of the few issues outside football that you can get universal consensus on."" In the UK, Cameron -- a successor to Thatcher as leader of the Conservative Party -- must be seen to defend the principles of his predecessor who mobilized troops to reclaim the islands. British Falklands conflict veteran Simon Weston said: ""It's not about asserting a claim, it's about allowing people of the Falklands to have the right to self-determination."" What has Argentina done to bolster its claims? Regional allies were recruited to the cause at the end of 2011, with members of the South American Mercosur trading bloc uniting to ban Falklands-flagged vessels from their ports. This is largely ""diplomatic dressing"" that will do little to isolate the islands, Professor Roett Riordan, who heads the Latin American program at John Hopkins University in Washington D.C, said last year. Is this really all about oil? Partly. There is Argentinian resentment of a British oil exploration project launched off the Falklands in 2010. This has been worsened by Argentina's recent relegation from exporter to net importer of hydrocarbons. Analysts, however, insist this remains a sideshow to the political traction offered by the Malvinas dispute. How much oil is there? Press reports say up to 8.3 billion barrels of undersea oil reserves could lie in the Falklands economic zone -- a radius of 320-kilometers around the islands, but despite successful drilling, this quantity is still speculative. The figures are backed by claims from small oil ventures, including Rockhopper and Borders & Southern Petroleum, which are hoping to raise capital for further exploration in fields licensed by the islands' British-backed government. Attempts to attract investment in the projects has been hampered by the Anglo-Argentinian dispute. Many major oil firms have interests in Argentina and are wary of upsetting Buenos Aires by involving themselves in the Falklands. Also a problem is the considerable cost of extracting deep water reserves from the remote South Atlantic. Professor Alex Kemp, a petroleum economics expert at the University of Aberdeen, described the Falklands oil reserve estimates as ""optimistic,"" adding that even if they are proven, the cost of exploiting them could still be prohibitive. ""It's one thing doing exploration, but when you come to development, we're talking about bigger volumes of materials and to get that there is expensive because at the moment there's nothing there -- just sheep farmers,"" he said. ""It will take a few 100 million barrels to make it worth it, and there's a number of ifs and buts before we get there."" Is conflict likely again? No, say analysts. While there are parallels with the 1980s -- politicians using Anglo-Argentinian tensions to court votes and divert from economic woes at home -- there is little appetite for conflict on either side. Any action is likely to remain in the diplomatic sphere. A former senior British military officer said in early 2012 that UK military cutbacks had left Britain unprepared for another Falklands conflict. Argentina is apparently in a similar state, with a heavily depleted military that experts say would be no match even for Britain's depleted force. ""Even if Argentina wanted to go to war, they have no military capacity,"" Jones said. He said Fernandez's own antipathy towards the military -- a legacy of her political opposition to Argentina's former dictatorship -- meant she would be unlikely to support even a maritime blockade of British vessels.","Several countries have disputed Falklands ownership since first recorded landfall in17th century .

"(CNN) -- Fifty thousand soldiers will patrol the streets of Bogota, Colombia, after violent protests that left at least two people dead and dozens injured, President Juan Manuel Santos announced Friday. Speaking on Colombian national television, the president said he may also send troops to other locations around Colombia that have seen violent clashes between protesters and security forces. Read more on CNN Espanol . CNN affiliate Caracol showed video of violent clashes between riot police and protesters in downtown Bogota, as well as images of other groups of protesters who blocked major highways connecting the Colombian capital with surrounding cities. Vandals have smashed windows at foreign businesses, banks and fast-food restaurants. They also damaged billboards and security cameras at bus stations around the capital. The protests have their roots in a strike that started on August 19. Farmers from around Colombia are demanding government support and credits, saying they can't compete against powerful agricultural businesses that benefit from free trade agreements. Farmers who traveled to the capital to protest were joined by labor unions and student groups in marches and protests throughout Bogota. Santos said those who staged acts of vandalism and attacked businesses are not legitimate farmers voicing their demands, but vandals taking advantage of the situation to loot and steal. ""Unfortunately, several of these protests were infiltrated and taken advantage of by vandals whose sole purpose is to create chaos and destruction and damage public and private property,"" Santos said. ""There's no protest that merits the loss of human life, even if the demands being made are legitimate."" The Colombian president offered a reward equal to $2,600 for information that allows authorities to identify and capture those responsible for the acts of vandalism and attacks against security forces. Ariel Avila, a Colombian political analyst, told CNN that guerrilla groups have tried to infiltrate the protests and have participated in acts of sabotage including burning buses and some other acts seen in recent days. ""But in general, this social movement has not been infiltrated,"" Avila said. ""Here in the country's central region, in the provinces of Cundinamarca"" -- which surrounds Bogota -- ""and Boyaca, there has not been guerrilla activity in at least 15 years, so what the president said is not entirely accurate."" Avila, a former professor at the National University of Colombia and the current director of an organization that monitors armed conflicts in Colombia, said that the farmers strike is causing shortages of food products in the capitals of four provinces, including Bogota. Each city has more than 500,000 inhabitants.","50,000 soldiers will patrol the streets of Bogota, Colombia, after violent protests .

Click on the videos below to follow their powerful stories. Andrew Stevens was in Tacloban when Haiyan hit. It was the first major population center in the region to feel the wrath of the super typhoon. Four days after this town of more than 220,000 people was reduced to rubble, he witnesses the devastation with Tacloban's horrified mayor. Nick Paton Walsh takes a drive through the storm-battered city at night. He says most people are seeking shelter in the wreckage of houses or in what remains of the Church's infrastructure -- with the occasional fire bringing light to this eerily dark town. While fears remain about looters and other security issues, he says the police and military appear in control, on the main roads at least. Paula Hancocks, who is also in Tacloban, has seen the suffering of the local population -- especially young children -- first hand. But from the ashes of disaster, she sees signs of hope, with babies born -- and surviving -- in the most atrocious conditions. Anna Coren, meanwhile, accompanies a Philippines military aid flight as authorities attempt to deliver supplies to those desperately in need. Situated where the Philippines meets the Pacific Ocean, the town of Guiuan had the look and feel of a tropical paradise. Unfortunately, its location on Samar Island's southeastern tip turned out to be a curse. It was cut off from outside communication and many basic necessities until recently, when a C-130 military cargo plane flew over the ravaged area and landed at its small airport. Ivan Watson reports from a military airbase in Cebu City, which has become a key hub in the relief effort. He speaks to a group of young Filipino men who showed up with food they collected to be sent out as aid. They say they were moved to help after seeing aerial pictures of how towns such as Guiuan had been completely cut off after the storm hit. Are you there?

"(CNN) -- Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini bracketed his striker Sergio Aguero with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as one of the ""three best players in the world"" after the Argentine led his side's 6-0 rout of Tottenham Hotspur Sunday. Aguero contributed two goals in an all action display at the Etihad Stadium with Jesus Navas also grabbing a double, including an opener after just 14 seconds. Aguero's strike partner Alvaro Negredo was on target and an own goal from Brazilian international Sandro made for an afternoon of sheer misery for Andre Villas-Boas' visitors. It was a stunning reaffirmation of City's title credentials and lifted them to fourth in the standings, while Tottenham on a poor recent run, dropped to ninth. For Pellegrini it was the ideal antidote to their inexplicable away form, they lost 1-0 at struggling Sunderland in the last match before the international break. ""The problem is away but I repeat: I don't think we play so different away from home,"" he told the official Manchester City website. ""I am absolutely sure that if we continue the way we are we will start to see results away."" At home, last year's runners-up to city rivals Manchester United, are all but invincible, racking up six straight EPL wins and scoring 26 goals, including an earlier 7-0 defeat of Norwich. Tottenham were on the back foot from the moment goalkeeper Hugo Lloris blundered straight from the kick off to hand Navas the chance to score exquisitely from a tight angle. The visitors enjoyed their best spell of the match as they attempted to level, but in the 34th minute Lloris was at fault again with another poor kick. He saved from Aguero, but Negredo followed up and his volley found its way into the net via Sandro. Aguero then converted a low cross from Navas and five minutes into the second half he made it four with Yaya Toure providing the assist. Negredo and Navas added further goals as a Tottenham defense which had conceded just six goals all season disintegrated. ""Everything went wrong for us, it's very hard to find explanations,"" Villas-Boas said. City and Pellegrini's day got better later Sunday as Manchester United were held 2-2 at promoted Cardiff having twice led. Wayne Rooney put the champions ahead before Frazier Campbell leveled for the Welsh side with a superb strike. Patrice Evra headed United ahead from a Rooney corner, but David Moyes' men could not hold their advantage and Campbell nearly equalized only to see his clever chip hit the woodwork. Danny Welbeck might have sealed a precious three points for United, but in the final minute Korean Kim Bo-kyung leveled with an emphatic header of his own for Cardiff. It prevented United from climbing into the top four and they trail leaders Arsenal by seven points after 12 games. In Italy, champions Juventus returned to the top of the Serie A table with a 2-0 away win over Livorno in Tuscany. It took second half strikes from Fernando Llorente and Carlos Tevez to end the promoted home side's resistance. Llorente slammed home a volley just after the hour mark before setting up Argentina's Tevez for the clinching second in the 75th minute. Juve lead Roma by two points, but the early pacesetters can return to the top with a win over Cagliari Monday.","Manchester City rout EPL title rivals Tottenham Hotspur 6-0 .

"(CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Thursday that a recently reached security agreement with the United States should not be signed until after elections in April. His comments in Kabul to thousands of tribal elders at a meeting -- known as a loya jirga, or grand assembly -- are at odds with what U.S. officials want. The loya jirga must decide whether to accept or reject the deal, which lays out a limited support role for American forces beyond next year. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki told reporters in Washington that authorities are ""seeking clarity on the meaning and intention,"" of Karzai's remarks. ""Broadly speaking, when we signed the strategic partnership agreement last year, both countries committed to completing the BSA (bilateral security agreement) within one year. We, of course, know the math. That window is this month, and we believe that signing the BSA sooner rather than later is essential to give Afghans certainty about their future before the upcoming elections, and enable the United States and other partners to plan for U.S. presence after 2014,"" she said. ""We need a timely conclusion of this in order to plan for a -- any potential post-2014 presence -- which means signing it by the end of the year,"" Psaki said. If approved, the agreement would go into effect January 1, 2015, and last ""until the end of 2024 and beyond, unless terminated"" by mutual agreement and with two years notice by either party, according to a copy of the deal posted online by the Afghan government that a U.S. official confirms is authentic. The subject of military raids and strikes has long been a sore point between the two countries, especially given a number of incidents in which noncombatant men, women and children were killed. The proposed deal contains references to respecting ""Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" and adds U.S. forces ""shall not target Afghan civilians, including in their homes."" It does not address past transgressions. ""If you accept and the parliament passes it, the bilateral security agreement would be signed when our election is done -- without any problem and with dignity,"" Karzai said Thursday in Kabul. Elections are scheduled for April. The Afghan president also addressed the subject of trust between his country and the United States. ""My trust with America is not good. I don't trust them, and they don't trust me. The last 10 years have shown that I have fought with them, and they have made propaganda against me,"" he said. U.S. troops first deployed to Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, which were coordinated by al Qaeda leaders then based in the south Asian nation. Since taking office, President Barack Obama has promised -- and, in some cases, acted -- to reduce troop levels there, in addition to stating the goal of ending the U.S. combat mission by the end of 2014. The approval of a security agreement would pave the way for Americans troops to remain on the ground in Afghanistan beyond that.

"(CNN) -- The anti-gay rights activist who recently toured Europe with a male escort has resigned from a group that promotes counseling for people who ""struggle with unwanted homosexuality,"" though the man insists that he is not gay. George Rekers resigned from the board of the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality, the group's website said Tuesday. ""I am immediately resigning my membership in NARTH to allow myself the time necessary to fight the false media reports that have been made against me,"" Rekers said in a statement posted on the group's website. ""With the assistance of a defamation attorney, I will fight these false reports because I have not engaged in any homosexual behavior whatsoever. ""I am not gay and never have been,"" the statement said. The association accepted the resignation, saying on its website Tuesday that it ""would hope that the legal process will sufficiently clarify the questions that have arisen in this unfortunate situation."" The group has scrubbed Rekers' writings from its site, with a page that formerly featured his work now bearing the message, ""Sorry, you've reached a page that doesn't exist."" Rekers, a Baptist minister, has been a prominent and effective foe of gay rights legislation across the country. He is a co-founder of the Family Research Council, one of Washington's most powerful conservative Christian advocacy groups, and has weighed in on anti-gay rights legislation across the country. He received about $120,000 to appear as an expert witness in a 2008 case challenging Florida's ban on gays and lesbians adopting. Rekers has written that gays are a ""deviant segment of society."" Revelations of Rekers' trip to Europe with a male escort surfaced last week, shortly after he returned to the U.S. The male escort who traveled with Rekers -- who goes by the name Lucien, though that is not his given name -- said that he advertises his service exclusively on the website rentboy.com, where visitors can choose from hundreds of male escorts in suggestive and revealing poses. Lucien says Rekers first contacted him through the site. He was hired to give Rekers daily ""sexual massages"" on the trip, which took them to London and Madrid, Lucien says. ""He got excited,"" Lucien said of the massages, adding that Rekers wanted Lucien to touch him, though Lucien said that he didn't have sex with Rekers and that Rekers didn't ask to have sex. According to a contract Lucien showed CNN, he was hired to carry Rekers' bags and to provide at least one hour's worth of massage every day in their shared room, at a cost of $75 a day. The contract also stipulated that Lucien spend at least eight hours a day with Rekers, including sharing two meals. Rekers' website provided a different account of how he met Lucien and of the trip, saying he needed help carrying luggage because of an ""ongoing condition following surgery."" The site said Rekers ""found his recent travel assistant by interviewing different people who might be able to help, and did not even find out about his travel assistant's internet advertisements offering prostitution activity until after the trip was in progress. There was nothing inappropriate with this relationship."" Rekers' site said he ""was not involved in any illegal or sexual behavior with his travel assistant."" Rekers is a distinguished professor emeritus at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine, according to his website. He earned a Ph.D. in psychology from the University of California, Los Angeles, an M.B.A. from Southern Wesleyan University and a Doctor of Theology degree from the University of South Africa, his site says. Lucien says Rekers told him about other boyfriends before the European trip. But Lucien says that in their ongoing conversations, Rekers continues to deny that he is gay. ""I actually asked him over the phone, 'Do you think you're gay?' and he said, 'no',"" Lucien said, adding that Rekers asked him not to share his story with the media. In a statement on its website Tuesday, the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality said it stood by its work promoting therapy for gays who wish to be straight. ""(T)hese personal controversies do not change the scientific data, nor do they detract from the important work of NARTH,"" the statement said. ""NARTH continues to support scientific research, and to value client autonomy, client self-determination and client diversity.""

"(CNN) -- Longtime ABC News personality Barbara Walters will retire from TV journalism in 2014, ABC reported late Sunday, closing a chapter on one of the most storied careers in broadcast journalism history. She is expected to make the announcement Monday on ""The View,"" a daytime talker she created in 1997. Walters, 83, will remain executive producer of that show. ""I am very happy with my decision and look forward to a wonderful and special year ahead both on 'The View' and with ABC News,"" she said. ""I created 'The View' and am delighted it will last beyond my leaving it."" Rumors of Walters' retirement surfaced in March. But she soon squashed them, saying on ""The View"" that ""if and when I might have an announcement to make, I will do it on this program."" Walters had a health scare in January when she suffered a cut on her forehead after falling on a stair while visiting the British ambassador's residence in Washington. She underwent surgery to repair a heart valve three years ago. ""There's only one Barbara Walters,"" said ABC News President Ben Sherwood. ""And we look forward to making her final year on television as remarkable, path-breaking and news-making as Barbara herself."" Walters' national broadcast career began in 1961 as a reporter, writer and panel member on NBC's ""Today"" show. She was promoted to co-host in 1974, but she was hired away by ABC in 1976. At ABC, she began ""The Barbara Walters Specials"" and ""10 Most Fascinating People,"" which has become a regular year-end program. Walters has interviewed every U.S. president and first lady since Richard and Pat Nixon. Starting in 1984, she spent two decades as co-host and correspondent for ABC's news magazine show ""20/20."" She still reports on occasion. Walters was born in Boston and has one daughter. She is expected to retire in the summer of 2014. ""I do not want to appear on another program or climb another mountain,"" Walters said.

"(CNN) -- A Massachusetts teen was convicted Wednesday of homicide as a result of texting while driving and will serve one year in prison. In a landmark case for the state, Aaron Deveau, 18, was found guilty on charges of vehicular homicide, texting while driving and negligent operation of a motor vehicle in a 2011 crash that fatally injured Donald Bowley, 55, of Danville, New Hampshire, and seriously injured a passenger in Bowley's car. ""I made a mistake,"" Deveau said Wednesday after his mother told the district court in Haverhill, Massachusetts he would not intentionally hurt anyone. ""If I could take it back, I would take it back."" Judge Stephen Abany sentenced the teen to two and a half years on the vehicular homicide charge and two years on the texting and causing injury charge. He will serve one year concurrently on both charges and the balance of both charges is suspended for five years. His license will be suspended for 15 years. ""There are no winners today,"" Essex County District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett said in a statement. ""A beloved grandfather is dead. A once active woman can no longer work and is still racked with pain from her injuries and a young man is going to jail. When we get behind the wheel of a car, we are obligated to drive with care. ... As we saw in this case, in a split second, many lives are forever changed."" The risks of texting while driving . In the February 20, 2011, accident, prosecutors said, Deveau's car crossed the center line on a street in Haverhill, which is in northeast Massachusetts near New Hampshire, and hit the vehicle Bowley was driving. Bowley's girlfriend, Luz Roman, 59, was in his car with him and suffered serious injuries. Haverhill Detective Thomas Howell testified the impact left the two ""almost folded into the floorboards."" Bowley died March 10, 2011, after he was taken off life support. ""My brother received such head trauma that ... there was no hope for him,"" Bowley's sister, Donna Burleigh, said in court. Roman talked about the incident's continued impact. ""Loss of sleeping, loss of my boyfriend. So many losses, I can't tell you how many,"" she told the judge. Essex Assistant District Attorney Ashlee Logan argued that Deveau may have erased some of his texts or lied to police after the accident about when he was texting. Deveau said after the crash in a taped interview with police, which was played in court, ""I was tired. I was distracted. When I looked away for one quick second, I came too close to her and I was trying to hit my brakes."" His defense lawyer said authorities set out from the beginning to link texting to the crash, a cause-and-effect relationship that he contends is not valid. Some 38 states ban text messaging for all drivers, while 31 prohibit all cell phone use by ""novice drivers,"" according to the Governor's Highway Safety Association. 2011: NTSB urges ban on use of phones while driving .","Defendant says he wishes he could take back ""mistake""

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Driving in China is dangerous in no small part because many drivers tend to ignore traffic rules. In 2011, China recorded more than 2 million road accidents, which led to more than 62,000 deaths, according to China's transport ministry. Despite steps to punish violators with harsher penalties, many drivers are crying foul. Read more: Holiday starts in gridlock for Chinese travelers . The revised rules took effect nationwide on Tuesday, the start of the new year. They include heavier penalties for drunken driving, talking on the phone while driving, as well as for running red and yellow lights. Each violation incurs the deduction of points from a driver's license, and the deduction of 12 points results in the suspension of a driver's license. To get it back, the driver must undergo a seven-day class of traffic rules and take a test. Many drivers thumb down the tougher rules, especially the one that considers a yellow traffic light the same as a red light. Running through them twice within a year can now result in the suspension of a license. ""I'm among the first victims of the new rule,"" wrote netizen @SunYiXuan on Chinese microblogging website Sina Weibo, ""I hit the car before me this morning when the driver slammed on the brake when the light turned yellow. Slow down when you're 1 km away from the traffic lights. Good luck my friends."" Unlike in some cities, Beijing has not installed traffic lights with numerical countdowns before they change, making it difficult for drivers to slow down or stop in time. ""If yellow light equals red light, we don't even need green lights any more. On and off of one light can do the work,"" @YuJianShouQing posted. A poll on Weibo shows 13,000 users, or 84%, of netizens who responded considered the new rule as ""unacceptable"". Beijing's traffic management bureau says the new regulations will be carried out strictly, even if countdown screens are not installed. According to local newspapers, the first traffic ticket for running a yellow light was issued Tuesday in Chengdu, a city in southwest China. Other cities like Shenzhen do not plan to punish drivers who run yellow lights -- for now. Still, a Chinese official from the Public Security Ministry's traffic control bureau said road accidents in five major cities -- Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Hangzhou and Jinan -- have decreased by 9% to 30% since the new rules took effect.","Many drivers cry foul over harsher penalties for violators of traffic rules .

"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico (CNN) -- A lifelong nature lover, Oscar Aranda studied biology in college and knew he wanted to work somehow with animals at sea. But he didn't find his calling until years later, when he was summoned to a beach and saw a gruesome scene that would change his life. ""I found a turtle chopped in pieces in a bucket, and its heart was still pounding,"" Aranda said. ""[The police] needed my help to decide what to do. ""When you see how the people kill [sea turtles] and how they are just using them for their meat and eggs -- it's sad."" There was nothing Aranda could do to save the turtle that summer night 10 years ago. But ever since then, he has patrolled Puerto Vallarta's beaches as an unofficial keeper of the sea turtle maternity ward. Aranda's conservation group, La Sociedad Ecológica del Occidente, is dedicated to protecting turtles that nest along Mexico's northwest Pacific beaches. From June through December -- prime nesting season -- Aranda and his unpaid volunteers watch over the shorelines where the turtles lay their eggs. ""The turtles are not safe,"" Aranda said. ""[A pregnant turtle] comes out in the dark, and a poacher can be hiding. ""We are not the police, but we just want to take care of [the turtle] and be there when she comes out to lay eggs."" There are seven sea turtle species worldwide, and six of them return to Mexico's shores each year to lay eggs. According to the World Wildlife Fund, all six species are ""currently in danger of extinction."" For Aranda, this reality is daunting. ""The sea turtles have been here since the dinosaurs,"" he said. ""Turtles are basically the link between the land and the ocean, and that movement is very important for many animals. Some species keep the reefs healthy, and there are many animals that depend on [sea] turtles to survive. They continue the life cycle."" iReport: Sea turtles struggle for comeback . Aranda's group, which is also known as Vallarta Rescue, is nonprofit and relies entirely on private donations. To earn a living, Aranda works during the day as an ecotourism boat driver. At sunset, he heads out to what he calls the perfect job in the perfect place. ""We go out to the beach and we wait for the turtles to come,"" he said. ""Sometimes we may see one, sometimes there are 13. It all depends. We might miss a turtle, and then we dig for the nest she left behind. We have to be there all night."" Twenty years ago, the Mexican government outlawed commercial fishing of sea turtles. It started fining people up to $16,000 for killing turtles or trafficking turtle eggs, turtle meat or products manufactured with turtle hides. But Mexico still has one of the highest rates of turtle poaching in the world. ""Very few poachers are caught or arrested each year,"" says marine biologist Wallace J. Nichols, who has been tracking sea turtles' behavioral patterns throughout Latin America, Asia and the United States. ""Poaching remains a big problem in Mexico partly because the people who buy sea turtles are often powerful, and partly because it's not a high priority"" for law enforcement. Aranda believes the poaching business is sustained by cultural curiosity and tradition, not financial profit. A single turtle egg sells for about 50 cents. ""I think it's how the people feel eating something forbidden,"" he said. ""They want to try what is illegal, but [they also] believe the eggs are aphrodisiacs and they want to feel more strong. They have seen their parents and their grandparents eating them, and it's a way of thinking that is very hard to change."" Changing the locals' perspective is part of what drives Aranda to stay awake during his night patrols in Puerto Vallarta. A good night, he says, is any night when a single turtle is spotted and protected from poachers. ""We clear the path for her to dig the hole, [we] wipe her clean of dirt and sand, and after that the babies are left alone and she returns to the ocean."" The team digs for the eggs, collects them and re-plants them in a protected hatchery on the CasaMagna Marriott Resort. The hotel has donated Aranda hatchery space in exchange for offering their guests turtle conservation lessons and participation in a sunset turtle release ceremony. ""As soon as the eggs hatch, we want the people to see them and learn,"" Aranda said. ""To give them an opportunity to be part of releasing a baby turtle [is] something that they will never forget."" Since 2004, when he started his conservation group, Aranda has facilitated the rescue and release of more than half a million baby turtles. The turtles' determination to keep nesting despite natural and manmade threats inspires him to continue -- all night, every night. ""They are endangered because of us,"" Aranda said. ""Against all odds, they continue coming. If I'm healthy, I'll be here. I can't see myself doing anything else."" Want to get involved?

"(LifeWire) -- Madeline Nelson finds a bag of slightly bruised apples and day-old bread left in a supermarket's Dumpster too tempting to pass up. Cindy Rosin rummages through discarded produce in trash bins outside a Manhattan grocery store. ""A lot of perfectly good food is thrown away,"" says Nelson, a spokeswoman for Freegan.info, a New York City group that promotes ""freeganism,"" which eschews conventional commerce in favor of a lifestyle that uses minimal resources. Freegans try not to buy things new -- not even food. Jumping into a garbage bin may sound scary, but Nelson, 52, who lives in Brooklyn, says it's no big deal. Humans, she says, are ""hardwired to be foragers."" For the thousands who search online for free merchandise, pick up roadside castoffs and even dig through Dumpsters, paying for everything they need is yesterday's news. At a time when many Americans are on tighter budgets and worrying about environmental conservation, the practice may get more popular. Roadside treasures . Sometimes opportunities present themselves.

""I'm saving money, but I'm also reducing the amount of stuff that needs to be produced and that eventually may end up in a landfill,"" says May, a founding member of Going Green Family, a Seattle grassroots organization that helps families run environmentally friendly households. New York City resident Christina Salvi, 32, agrees that curbside shopping is the way to go. ""My whole apartment is furnished with discards,"" she says. ""I find really great stuff all the time. Here in New York, it's kind of obscene how much goes into the trash."" Salvi helped launch FreeMeet, a local recycling event where people share their unwanted items. ""Our goal is to have everything find a new home,"" she says. Free commerce . Before hitting the mall, find out whether someone in your city is getting rid of the thing you want, says Deron Beal, 40, founder of Freecycle.org, a Web site built on the premise that ""one person's trash is another's treasure."" Here's how it works: As in the ""free"" section of Craigslist.org, users post what they're giving or seeking, then coordinate the details. On thousands of Freecycle message boards, the dialogue looks like this: OFFERED: Two Pez dispensers. TAKEN: Krups espresso machine. WANTED: Garden hose that works. OFFERED: Adult diapers, size small. It's an eclectic mix, but that means there's something for everyone, says Beal. He launched the nonprofit group four years ago with 20 or 30 friends. Now it has 4.5 million users, he says, with 70,000 newcomers each week helping to reduce the growth of landfills. At the heart of Freecycle.org, Beal says, is a spirit of giving, not getting: People in South Dakota collected prom dresses for teenage girls; a 95-year-old Arizona man looks for old bikes he can fix up and give to disadvantaged children; others have joined together to find clothing and supplies for orphans in Haiti. Beal uses the site, too, but only for giving. ""My wife has made it clear that it's good for purging, not collecting,"" he says. ""But I did get a George Foreman grill once."" The people giving it away turned out to be neighbors he had never met. ""When I picked up the grill, they also gave me a half dozen eggs from their chickens,"" he says. ""It's a beautiful example of community giving."" FreeSwapper.org started last year to provide a similar service, and FreeSharing.org lists hundreds of organizations across the country with the same goals. Dumpster diving . Curious about Dumpster diving? Freegan.info keeps a city-by-city listing of prime Dumpster locations, from bakeries to bookstores. Large chain stores in wealthy neighborhoods are particularly prone to tossing edible foods, Nelson says. If you go, she advises, bring a friend (in case the lid closes on you) and wear gloves to protect your hands from glass and other sharp objects. Ask your local police department first whether it's OK -- some cities have criminalized Dumpster diving. Don't salvage things that need to be refrigerated or show traces of mold, and thoroughly wash any food you've taken from a Dumpster before consuming. It's also a good idea to conduct a smell test of any food you may take; if it smells bad, it probably is spoiled and should be avoided. Nelson says freeganism has nothing to do with income. She says many divers, herself included, have at least moderate incomes: ""It's really about boycotting the consumerist system."" But not everything can be found in a Dumpster. Nelson admits that some things must be acquired the old-fashioned way: at the store. Like cooking oil -- ""You can never find enough of that."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- There is compelling evidence that the economic security of women and their families is more fragile today than ever. Women are one-half of the nation's workforce, yet disparities in pay, the shrinking of the public sector and stagnant wages have left too many women and families on the losing end of our nation's economic recovery. Nearly two-thirds of all minimum wage workers are women. The poverty rate among women is as high as it has been in 17 years. Women are more likely to file for bankruptcy and have less retirement savings. Women have rushed to get more education and training, but student debt has skyrocketed. Five decades after the Equal Pay Act, women still make just 77 cents for every dollar men make for the same job, an average real difference of $11,000 a year. Unmarried women -- single, widowed or divorced -- are the most economically insecure. These disparities persist for many reasons. Too many women face financial pressures simply because of outdated policies and a ""Mad Men"" view of the world that constrain opportunities for women's full participation in our economy. Our country's policies simply do not reflect the way families live today, with both parents in the workforce and more single-parent households than ever. A second income is no longer a luxury; it is a necessity. For far too long, Washington has been silent on these issues. It's time for an agenda that addresses the economic instability of women and their families. This week, House Democrats announced an economic agenda for America's women and families. It recognizes a simple fact: When women succeed, America succeeds. It reflects the same spirit advanced 165 years ago at the first Women's Rights Convention at Seneca Falls, New York, where American women began their quest for equal rights and equal opportunity. House Democrats' agenda -- ""When Women Succeed, America Succeeds: An Economic Agenda for Women and Families"" -- stands on the shoulders of what was accomplished at at Seneca Falls and what was advanced by activists in every generation by addressing the economic challenges facing women and families in our time. Our agenda promotes policies that raise wages and ensure pay equity in the workplace. It allows working parents to support their families, succeed in school and at the office, and care for their children. Achieving good and equal pay for women is essential. We must enact paycheck fairness legislation to ensure women get paid what they deserve and put more money in the pockets of working women and their families. We must expand access to job training and education assistance so that working women can obtain better-paying jobs in the future. We must do more to support women-owned businesses and nurture entrepreneurship by providing more access to capital. Today, women play an expanded role in the workforce, in businesses small and large, and in our homes as primary breadwinners. Given this reality, we need policies that allow a better work and family balance for all workers, not just a select few at the top of the income ladder. The Democrats' agenda increases access to paid sick leave, expanding the Family Medical Leave Act and protecting pregnant workers and new mothers so that they can't be fired or demoted. The high cost of child care is another economic barrier for working families, forcing too many to make a near-impossible choice between low-quality child care or forgoing wages to stay home to care for their children. That's why we must increase access to affordable, quality child care. One key step forward should be to provide all low- and moderate-income 4-year-olds with access to high-quality preschool, as proposed by President Barack Obama. Congress must also take steps to support early Head Start and child care partnerships and expand existing child and child care tax credits. Our pro-family agenda will help strengthen the middle class, grow our economy and provide a brighter future for the next generation. Democrats have long led the way to address the health and economic security of women and families -- from the passage of the Affordable Care Act and the Lilly Ledbetter Act to our continued fight to strengthen and protect Social Security and Medicare. Our women and families economic agenda is the next step in our mission to expand opportunity for all Americans. American women and their families are at an economic crossroads. We want them to succeed, not sink. That is why every chance we get we will call for passage of the policies necessary to meet the economic needs of America's women and families today, to help them succeed so America will succeed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","Nancy Pelosi and Rosa DeLauro: Women and their families are worse off than ever .

"(CNN) -- Al Qaeda fighters in Syria have seized another town on the border with Turkey, consolidating their grip on a swath of northern Syria. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) took control of the town of Atimah at the end of last week, further tilting the balance away from more moderate factions of the Free Syrian Army. If ISIL's record elsewhere is any guide, the people of Atimah can expect the imposition of strict Islamic customs, with women and girls being coerced to dress more conservatively and Sharia, or religious, courts being established to dispense justice. Opposition activists say ISIL has cut down a famous landmark -- an ancient oak tree -- near Atimah. The militants claimed people had been worshipping the tree rather than God, an allegation rejected by locals, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Rebels: Syrian airstrikes kill at least 40 . The loss of Atimah will make it more difficult for brigades of the Free Syrian Army to bring in supplies from Turkey and get wounded fighters across the border to hospitals. It also may worsen the plight of internally displaced Syrians who have swollen the population of this northern corner of the country. Another jihadist group now controls one of Syria's main oilfields, according to the Observatory. It says Jabhat al Nusra (JaN) took over the al Omar field over the weekend, though an industry source said the rebels' lack of technical expertise and damaged infrastructure would make it difficult for them to extract the crude. ISIL and JaN have made substantial gains in Syria in recent months. In an article for the forthcoming edition of Sentinel, the journal of the Combating Terrorism Center, Brian Fishman argues that ISIL and other jihadist groups are more dangerous in Syria than they ever were in Iraq -- ""more likely to sustainably control territory, project power around the region, possibly sponsor global terrorist attacks, and catalyze a new generation of jihadist insurrection."" They ""now include up to 12,000 fighters combined,"" Fishman says. ""The ISIL is also bringing in much larger numbers of foreign fighters, including approximately 900 Europeans, many of whom are learning to use sophisticated weapons and small unit tactics."" He adds: ""Not only are far more foreign fighters entering the conflict, they are playing much more complex roles as fighters and commanders rather than simply as fodder for suicide attacks. Considering that the most important role of a veteran jihadist is as a trainer and motivator, this outflow is worrisome."" ISIL's videos posted online highlight the contribution of foreign fighters from Chechnya, Kosovo and across the Arab world and Europe. Last week, it posted a photograph of a 17-year-old French citizen killed while fighting in its ranks. Its rise to prominence will not upset the Syrian government. President Bashar al Assad has frequently characterized the rebels as terrorists associated with al Qaeda, and infighting among rebel groups, Islamists and Kurdish militia in the north works in the regime's favor. Activists say the group that had previously held Atimah, Suqur al Islam, had spent so much effort battling other FSA factions that it was helpless to defend the town. For the United States and other western governments, ISIL's expansion to north and eastern Syria, especially Idlib and Aleppo provinces, is alarming. Seven years ago, the United States committed tens of thousands of troops and billions of dollars to rolling back al Qaeda in Iraq. The famous 'surge' succeeded in buying time and space for more moderate forces, but the militants -- battered and bloodied -- clung on. Now they have space in Syria, where U.S. Special Forces and military technology are absent. Fishman, who is a fellow at the New America Foundation, says, ""Although the worst fears of Iraq in 2006 were avoided, they have the potential to be realized in Syria,"" not least because jihadist groups benefit from the tolerance or even support of ""close U.S. allies such as Turkey, which has allegedly backed JaN skirmishes against Kurds in Syria, and Qatar."" Syria's brutal war within a war gains momentum . Both ISIL and JaN have been involved in attacks against Kurdish militia in northern Syria, with several vehicle-borne suicide attacks in recent days. But Fishman says Turkey's policy of using jihadist groups as a counterbalance to Kurdish ambitions in Syria is ""inane."" ""Obviously Turkey has had a long fight with Kurdish groups, but toleration of al-Qaeda is always a bad idea,"" he says. ""These groups cannot be controlled, and they contain elements that measure success in completely brutal ways."" ISIL seems supremely confident of its destiny and has even defied the overall leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al Zawahiri, who earlier this year instructed it to confine its operations to Iraq. Rather than cede the lead role in Syria to al Nusra, as Zawahiri ordered, ISIL last week called for ""all jihadist leaders and soldiers and people to accelerate in joining the project of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant."" Its ""project"" is Islamic rule in areas it controls. ISIL has posted videos online showing its members staging games for children and providing social services, but it has also coerced women and girls into wearing the veil and gloves in public. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, it has introduced Islamic dress for schoolchildren and banned men from teaching girls. Fishman says the group has used ""internal discipline and good PR efforts to control the darker aspects of its nature, but that is a temporary fix. The group continues to espouse radical ideological concepts (even by al-Qaeda standards)."" Fishman told CNN that while ISIL and JaN collaborate on the battlefield, they have different aims and ideologies. ""JaN represents the newest breed of al-Qaeda franchises, which tend to blend nationalist and jihadi goals,"" he said. ""ISIL on the other hand is the most direct descendant of Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi and the violence-first, absolutist strain of al-Qaeda. The conflict between these groups is indicative of larger tensions in the al-Qaeda enterprise."" Jabhat al Nusra has joined forces with other Islamist groups both to strengthen itself against ISIL and because it ""wants to win Syria. ISIL wants to win globally and the Syrian borders mean far less to it,"" Fishman told CNN. Within the fractured and increasingly discouraged rebel movement, both jihadist groups are assuming larger roles, with disturbing implications for Syria's future.

"(CNN) -- On the road for 300 days a year, a Cirque du Soleil touring troupe of 175 relies on the same precise planning for its travel arrangements as it does for its acrobatic moves and dare devil routines. ""Right now, we're in London, in the U.K., and we're working on making sure we have documents ready for Spain, for Russia, for France, because we're visiting those countries by the end of the year,"" said GeneviÃ¨ve Deslandes, the manager of the Canadian performing group's traveling show Kooza. To plan for its visit to each city, one of the first orders of business is finding a place to stay. During their time in London earlier this year, the cast and crew stayed in the London Bridge area in 85 apartments. ""For London, it's really nice that we have everyone in the same place, but in Madrid, we're in 24 different places,"" said Jerome Vezina, the travel and lodging coordinator. He says they work on housing for about three cities at the same time. Everyone must pack for all seasons, taking everything they will need all year round. Each of these ultimate road warriors is allowed three suitcases -- two to send ahead and one to travel with. ""We don't live in the present -- sometimes it's sad to say like that -- we really live in the future,"" Deslandes said. More than just a circus, Kooza is a community that includes two physiotherapists and four chefs. Teachers provide schooling for the younger performers. For 15-year-old Mongolian contortionists, it's straight from math class to warm-ups for the next show. But learning on the road has its benefits, according to Thierry DeGagne, one of the teachers. ""My student is reading about Rosetta Stone, and we're going to visit it,"" she said.","Cirque du Soleil's Kooza show is on the road for 300 days a year .

"(Coastal Living) -- Imagine yourself on a ferryboat deck with a latte in one hand, your overnight bag at your feet, and the dazzling Seattle, Washington, skyline filling the horizon behind you. While the boat churns across Elliott Bay, the Space Needle disappears from view and a shoreline materializes in the distance. Bainbridge Island is about 35 minutes from Seattle by ferry. You're bound for Bainbridge Island -- an antidote to Seattle's big-city bustle and an introduction to Puget Sound island life. Here's how to make the most of a 30-hour visit. 9:35 a.m. Skip the commuter rush and take a midmorning ferry from Seattle. The 35-minute ride stops near Winslow, the downtown shopping district, a five-minute walk from the ferry terminal. Have a look around; you'll get the chance to shop tomorrow. Drop your bags at your hotel (see our recommendations under ""10 p.m.""). Now, it's time to explore. Although Bainbridge isn't large, you'll need a car, taxi or bike to reach many areas. 10:30 a.m. In Winslow, you'll find a coffeehouse on every block. Pegasus Coffee House and Gallery serves beverages made from locally roasted beans in a vine-covered waterfront building, while Andante Coffee and Bainbridge Bakers attract loyal followings. Enjoy a cup of joe, then grab some take-out stir-fry from Teriyaki Town or a sandwich from Real Foods Market and Cafe. 12 p.m. Spend your afternoon discovering the island's beauty in pristine woods, state parks and the waterfront. Once a private estate owned by a timber magnate, Bloedel Reserve is now a 150-acre sanctuary of trees, wildlife, ponds and gardens. Open by appointment, the park's paths meander past majestic Douglas firs, hemlocks and cedars. Elsewhere on the island, try IslandWood, a 255-acre outdoor learning center, which offers three-hour walking tours of its breathtaking property. If you still have time, take a boat tour. Back of Beyond Explorations and Exotic Aquatics Scuba & Kayaking both rent kayaks. Prefer pedaling to paddling? Rent a bike from Classic Cycle, which operates from the barn near the ferry terminal in the summer. Or explore by car. The coastal route along the island's south end borders stop-and-stare views and the chance to watch the Bremerton-Seattle ferry travel through Rich Passage. 6 p.m. When it's time for dinner, choose from one of Bainbridge's fine-dining restaurants: Edna's Beach Café, Madoka Pan-Pacific Restaurant, Café Nola and The Four Swallows. Doc's Marina Grill, along the waterfront, serves some of the best fish-and-chips on Puget Sound. Sawatdy Thai Cuisine's dishes stand out despite its location next to a gas station. 7:30 p.m. While several restaurants offer live music, The Harbour Public House and The Living Room, a wine bar, are the island's best adults-only venues. On the first Saturday of each month, The Edge improv troupe grabs the local playhouse stage. Or catch independent films at The Historic Lynwood Theatre, a 1936 movie house on the island's south end. If you haven't already eaten, make a pre-showtime stop at nearby Treehouse Café for the island's best thin-crust pizza. 10 p.m. There's more to see and do tomorrow, so head back to your hotel for some shut-eye: The Eagle Harbor Inn wins praise as Winslow's premier accommodations, with four well-appointed rooms and three luxurious townhomes. Island Country Inn provides traditional motel amenities, and more than a dozen B&Bs and rental homes dot the island. Two of the most exquisite: Waterfall Gardens, a 5-acre retreat with spring-fed ponds, waterfalls and gardens, and Skiff Point Guest House, with a 180-degree view of Puget Sound. 9 a.m. Wake up with traditional morning fare at Richie's 305 Diner or Streamliner Diner. For a lighter option, try Blackbird Bakery. You won't find toast on the bakery's chalkboard menu, but order it anyway. When the thick-cut wheat slices and jam arrive at your table, you'll be glad you did. 10 a.m. There's still time to explore Winslow's compact commercial district, which offers everything from a top-notch travel store to a distinctive candle shop. At Eagle Harbor Book Co., browse titles by some of the island's almost 200 published authors, such as David Guterson, who penned ""Snow Falling on Cedars."" A few doors down, Bainbridge Arts & Crafts represents hundreds of regional artists. Clothes shopping is an upscale affair -- the numerous boutiques include Adam & Eve Clothing Company, which carries more than 100 styles of jeans. When you've had your fill of browsing, get a bite to eat. Then indulge your sweet tooth at either Mora Iced Creamery or Bon Bon Confections. 1 p.m. Before the sun sets on your visit, stop at the Bainbridge Island Historical Society & Museum to uncover a history tied to shipbuilding, strawberry farming, and Japanese internment during World War II. Or stroll the boardwalk that leads from Eagle Harbor to the ferry terminal. 2:55 p.m. Board the ferry, and depart Bainbridge relaxed. Now that you've had a glimpse of island life, Puget style, we know you'll be back. Bainbridge: Why go now? Think Puget Sound and you think green. But from late September through October, maple, native alder and white birch trees splash a rainbow of colors onto the island's evergreen canvas. No matter when you come, expect some rain. Before you go: Make an appointment to explore Bloedel Reserve, 206/842-7631. And book hotel accommodations: The Eagle Harbor Inn, 206/842-1446; Island Country Inn, 800/842-8429; Waterfall Gardens Private Suites, 206/842-1434; Skiff Point Guest House, 206/842-7026.

"(CNN) -- Starting Monday, same-sex couples will be allowed to marry in New Jersey. The New Jersey Supreme Court denied the state's request to temporarily prevent such marriages last week, clearing the way. Some ceremonies already are planned. U.S. Sen.-elect Cory Booker, the current Newark mayor, plans to recognize the marriages of several same-sex couples at 12:01 a.m. The couples will be married at City Hall, according to the Facebook page of gay rights group Garden State Equality. Troy Stevenson, executive director of the group, said last week that the high court's decision means ""the door is open for love, commitment and equality under the law."" ""This is a huge victory for New Jersey's same-sex couples and their families,"" added Hayley Gorenberg, deputy legal director of gay rights group Lambda Legal and the organization's lead attorney on the case. ""Take out the champagne glasses -- wedding bells will soon be ringing in New Jersey!"" That enthusiasm was not shared by everyone. ""It is extremely disappointing that the New Jersey Supreme Court has allowed the ruling of an activist judge to stand pending its appeal through the court system,"" said Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, last week. ""All in all, today's ruling is another sad chapter in watching our courts usurp the rights of voters to determine issues like this for themselves."" Gov. Chris Christie's administration appealed -- and asked the court to delay -- a lower court's September 27 order that the state must allow same-sex couples to marry beginning October 21, rather than give them the label ""civil union."" The appeal will be heard in January. But the state Supreme Court on Friday declined to delay the September order in the meantime, writing that ""the state has not shown a reasonable probability that it will succeed on the merits"" of the appeal. ""When a party presents a clear case of ongoing unequal treatment, and asks the court to vindicate constitutionally protected rights, a court may not sidestep its obligation to rule for an indefinite amount of time,"" the 20-page decision read. ""Under those circumstances, courts do not have the option to defer."" New Jersey has recognized civil unions between same-sex couples since 2007, after the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the state must allow same-sex couples all the rights and benefits of marriage. As far as state rights and benefits went, civil unions and marriages differed only in label. New Jersey is one of four states that offer civil unions, but not marriage, to same-sex couples. The others are Colorado, Hawaii and Illinois. Same-sex marriage is legal in 13 U.S states -- California, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington -- as well as the District of Columbia. Same-sex marriage is banned in every state not mentioned above, except for New Mexico, which has no laws banning or allowing it.","Newark mayor plans to recognize the marriages of several same-sex couples .

"New York (CNN) -- A 29-year-old Zumba instructor was sentenced to 10 months in jail Friday for engaging in prostitution out of her fitness studio in the picturesque town of Kennebunk, Maine. In addition to the time in jail, Alexis Wright must pay more than $57,000 in restitution and $1,000 in fines, according to a sentencing memorandum. Prosecutors dropped more than 80 other counts and downplayed the more serious tax related charges from felonies to misdemeanors, according to the sentencing documents. Wright's lawyer Sarah Churchill told CNN Friday that the outcome was fair and that ""it was also important to be able to close this phase, so that Alexis can move forward and begin to heal from all of this."" In court Friday, Wright said, ""I am a person who knows the difference between right and wrong and for this reason I chose to take the time in jail to take responsibility for my actions."" Wright and her business partner, Mark Strong, sparked uproar in the quiet Maine town last year when a prostitution ring became public and a list of clients was released and spread around town. On the list were lawyers, accountants, a local TV personality and many others, according to Strong's lawyer. Court documents show Wright videotaped intimate encounters with some of her customers in three locations in the small picket-fenced community of 10,000 that is Kennebunk, including the store-front Zumba exercise studio run by Wright. Zumba is, according to the brand's official website, ""an exhilarating, effective, easy-to-follow, Latin-inspired, calorie-burning dance fitness-party that's moving millions of people toward joy and health."" Maine's State Police and the state's Drug Enforcement Administration began investigating the prostitution ring in 2011 after receiving a tip that there was more going on at the studio than a Latin dance fitness-party. In February 2012, Wright's Zumba studio was raided, as well as Strong's offices. According to Strong's sentencing memo, Wright would not engage in a prostitution session unless Strong had ""prior knowledge of the session and was actively watching via the Skype connection."" Over 13,000 Skype video call snapshots were recovered from Strong's computer, according to the memo. Strong was found guilty of promotion of prostitution and conspiracy to promote prostitution in March, according to his court sentencing memo. He was sentenced to 20 days in jail, according to court documents. Through tears on Friday, Wright told the judge that she planned on helping other women who were in similar situations. ""The problem is that a situation like mine is happening every day all over the country and it seems as though everyone would rather turn a blind eye to it rather than see the ugly reality that it is,"" Wright said. ""It is my intention to stand up for what is right and when I get out I am going to pursue helping people fight through situations similar to mine."" CNN's Adam Reiss, Deborah Feyerick and Michael Pearson contributed to this report.","29-year-old Zumba instructor was sentenced to 10 months in jail Friday .

"(CNN) -- How do you dispose of Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles? Call in private industry. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons announced Friday it has invited chemical disposal firms to let the group know if they're interested, but added that it's working on a tight schedule. The request for ""expressions of interest"" comes a week after the organization's executive council asked its director-general to explore ""options for destruction in chemical disposal facilities"" of chemicals that Syria has declared. The document lists 19 chemicals. Most of Syria's declared chemical weapons program includes common industrial chemicals or otherwise chemicals that can safely be rendered harmless or destroyed, the OPCW said. An estimated 1.8 million pounds (800 metric tons), accounting for a major part of Syria's stockpile, is to be disposed of commercially at a cost estimated at $47 million to $54 million, it added. The companies will also destroy the effluent resulting from the ""effective destruction"" of higher-priority chemicals. But hurry. The closing date for receipt of an expression of interest is November 29. A joint OPCW-United Nations team charged with overseeing the destruction of the weapons began inspecting sites in October. The U.N. Security Council resolution that authorized the mission set a deadline of mid-2014 for Syria to destroy its chemical weapons or face consequences. The OPCW said it expected that ""the most critical chemicals"" would be removed from Syria by the end of 2013. The U.N. resolution on Syria's chemical weapons was based on a deal struck between the United States and Russia that averted an American military strike over allegations the Syrian government used sarin nerve gas in an August 21 attack on a Damascus suburb. U.S. officials said at least 1,400 people died in the attack. Syria denied responsibility, blaming rebel forces. In an update last Friday, the OPCW said it had verified that more than 60% of Syria's declared unfilled munitions had been destroyed. Syria has committed to destroy all unfilled warheads and bombs by January 31. It follows its announcement on October 31 that Syria had destroyed all its declared chemical weapons mixing, filling and production facilities and that all of the chemical weapons at inspected sites were under seal. Opposition factions unite . The movement on the chemical weapons front came as six opposition fighting factions announced Friday the formation of a new alliance: the Islamic Front. ""This blessed front has been formed with the will of God to fulfill our countrymen's ambitions in Syria and in accordance with their aspirations and to pave the way for the gradual unification of factions and founding movements,"" Ahmed Issa Alsheikh, an official of the group, said in a video statement on Al Jazeera Arabic. The alliance includes tens of thousands of fighters from some of Syria's most powerful Islamist groups, including Ahrar al-Sham, Suqour al-Sham, the Islamic Army and the Tawhid Brigade. The groups control territory in key areas across Syria and have been fighting forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad along the critical lines of Damascus and Aleppo, among others. ""The Islamic Front will be militarily, politically, and socially independent and its aim will be the complete fall of the Assad regime and the creation of a sovereign Islamic state,"" Abu Firas, a spokesman for the Tawhid Brigade, the largest rebel faction in Aleppo, said in an online statement. The announcement diminishes the stature of the Western-backed Free Syrian Army and its leadership abroad, the Syrian National Coalition, as leaders inside the country seek to distance themselves from a command structure criticized for failing to serve the opposition's needs on the ground. ""This will change and it will increase our numbers and unify our ideology,"" said Capt. Islam Alloush, a spokesman for the Islamic Army, an alliance member, in an interview with CNN. ""We are optimistic that this will make us stronger."" The moves come after the al Qaeda-linked Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant succeeded as the predominant military force in northern Syria, marginalizing and even fighting Syria's more moderate factions. ISIS's largely foreign fighting force poses a threat to cash-strapped rebel groups competing for funding, resources and influence in Syria's more than two-year civil war. The Syrian conflict began in March 2011 after government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring movement and is now a full-blown civil war. The United Nations estimates that more than 100,000 people have died in the conflict. CNN's Susannah Cullinane contributed to this report.","Chemical weapons group requests ""expressions of interest"" from private industry .

"(CNN) -- Violence marred Black Friday shopping in at least seven states, including California, where police say a woman doused fellow shoppers with pepper spray in a bid to snag a discounted video game console. The incident happened Thursday night at a Walmart in the Porter Ranch area of Los Angeles, said Officer Robert Chavira, a police spokesman. Ten people were exposed to the spray. Los Angeles firefighters treated them at the scene and no one required hospitalization, Chavira said. The woman sprayed the crowd as people were grabbing for Xbox video game consoles, Los Angeles Police Detective Gus Villanueva said. The suspect was able to pay for her purchases and leave the store before police arrived, Chavira said. Villanueva described the suspect as a Hispanic woman, 32 to 38 years of age, 5-foot-3, 140 pounds and wearing black pants and a black sweater. Authorities haven't identified the suspect and will be looking at available video, Villanueva said. He said charges such as spraying a caustic compound would be determined later, but the action doesn't appear to have been self-defense. One witness to the incident, Juan Castro, said he and other shoppers were hunting for ""deals,"" when a woman began using pepper spray. He was trying to buy a Wii video game at $20, marked down from a typical $60, he said. ""I don't know if she felt threatened or she felt she had to do that to get what she wanted,"" Castro told CNN. ""I didn't see her personally, but I sure got the scent of the mace. I got it in my throat. It was burning. I saw people around me, they got it really bad. As you see in the video, some woman was crying 'my eyes, my eyes,'"" Castro said. ""I tried to get away as quickly as possible because I didn't think it was worth it. No deal's worth that,"" he said. Incidents also occurred in South Carolina, North Carolina, Florida, New York, Alabama and Connecticut, with most of the reported incidents happening at or near Walmart stores. Despite the reports, Walmart said the day's shopping frenzy had been remarkably safe for shoppers at its thousands of stores nationwide. ""There were a few unfortunate incidents but overall we have received very positive feedback from our customers,"" Walmart spokesman Greg Rossiter said. In 2008, crowds of frantic Black Friday shoppers trampled a Walmart employee in New York as he and other workers tried to unlock the door at 5 a.m. While no deaths were reported in this year's shopping, authorities said they handled fights, shootings and other incidents through the morning. Psychologist Jeff Gardere, in an appearance Friday on CNN, put some of the blame on retailers for staging sales that encourage hyper-competitive behavior among shoppers who may be desperate because of the poor economy. ""They shouldn't be psyching them up so much and using all sorts of psychological tactics to get them to feed into this desperation and competitive spirit,"" he said. ""I think people are whipped into a frenzy, physically, psychologically,"" he said. In San Leandro, California, police had one man in custody and another was hospitalized after a 1:45 a.m. shooting in a Walmart parking lot. ""It was a robbery gone bad,"" police Sgt. Mike Sobek told reporters. ""The victim's family fought with the robbers. They were able to detain one suspect. We are not sure if that suspect is the shooter, but we do have one person in custody right now."" In Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, police said two people suffered injuries in an apparent armed robbery attempt after they left a Walmart store around 1 a.m. Friday, CNN affiliate WMBF reported. Would-be robbers struck a man on the head and shot a woman in the leg before another shopper displayed a gun and the assailants fled, the station said, citing Myrtle Beach Police Capt. Kevin Heins. The woman was taken to a hospital for treatment, he said. Sheriff's deputies in Fayetteville, North Carolina, were looking for two men after shots were fired about 2 a.m. at a shopping mall. And in Kinston, North Carolina, an off-duty officer working security at a Walmart sprayed shoppers with pepper spray in an effort to stop a disturbance there, WITN reported, citing police Sgt. Roland Davis. Customer Angel Bunting told the station it happened while people were waiting to buy discount cell phones and a man fell into a display. She said she thought security believed there was a fight, according to WITN. Police arrested a man in a Kissimmee, Florida, Walmart on a resisting arrest charge after an early morning altercation at the jewelry counter, according to the police department. In Rome, New York, a brawl broke out in the electronics department at a Walmart moments after midnight, CNN affiliate WSTM reported, citing the Oneida County Sheriff's Office. Two people were taken to the hospital for treatment of minor injuries, the station reported. Police in Florence, Alabama, said they had to use a stun gun -- twice -- on a Walmart customer, CNN affiliate WAFF reported. The 22-year-old man was charged with public intoxication, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest around 11 p.m. Thursday, an hour after the store opened its doors for Black Friday, WAFF reported, citing police. A picture of the incident distributed on Twitter shows the man lying face down in an aisle, the officer atop him with a knee on his back. And in Southington, Connecticut, iReporter Ryan Casale said he witnessed police using a stun gun on a man at the Walmart store where he was shopping. He said he wasn't sure what was happening or why, but said the event left an impression on him. ""This was my first Black Friday shopping experience, and I'll never forget what I saw,"" he said. ""You see sides of people that they, themselves didn't even know existed.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The faithful walk past a Charlie Chaplin who twirls his cane, a Marilyn who shows off her cleavage while blowing kisses and a ranting, Jheri-curled Samuel Jackson (a la ""Pulp Fiction"") who flashes his Bad Mother F**ker wallet. They didn't come here to ogle the impersonators on Hollywood Boulevard. Nor did they come to snatch up tickets to meet Madame Tussaud's wax figures. Yawn. And they certainly didn't arrive to hop on the Crime Scene Tour bus. No, they take their seats on a cement wall around the corner, in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre, where they wait in anticipation for something bigger. ""I'd like to see the toilet where George Michael got busted"" for a lewd act with an undercover cop, says an Aussie. ""Anything Britney, I'll be happy with,"" says the Aussie's partner, his camera at the ready. ""We'd like to see Lindsay drunk, facedown somewhere. That would be awesome,"" a woman gushes, her friend nodding beside her. Welcome to the TMZ Tour, where for the special reduced price of $49, an adult can board a bus and take a two-hour unashamed dip into the celebrity gossip sleaze pool. Children are welcome to dive in for $39. ""We were going to do the movie stars' homes, but that seemed so boring,"" says Mark Green, 33, of Newcastle, Australia, who flew into Los Angeles just hours earlier and rushed here, jet lag be damned. ""This was the newest, hippest thing to do."" Beckoned by the ticket taker, the assembled crowd moves toward the bus. ""You guys excited?"" yells the escort, who leads the way through a maze of corridors. First they let out a collective scream, and then the fist-pumping chants begin: ""T-M-Z! T-M-Z! T-M-Z!"" There's nowhere Karen Morin of Long Beach, California, would rather be. ""Our main source of news is TMZ,"" boasts Morin, who's come here to celebrate her 47th birthday. On this tour in late August, a couple dozen enthusiasts file onto the open-sided TMZ-emblazoned bus. A young girl, too innocent to know about sex tapes, bounces on board, her TMZ stocking cap slightly askew. Nabbing a spot in the front row is a Canadian sporting a made-for-the-occasion black T-shirt that reads, ""I'm a Lawyer!"" -- the sign-off for Harvey Levin's ""TMZ on TV"" gossip news show. Keith Jordan, an actor who'd rather keep his age to himself, takes a seat facing the excited crowd. ""We don't have culture in LA,"" he announces, sliding into his tour guide role. ""We have the Kardashians!"" He promises to show the group where celebrities eat, party and ""buy their kids really creepy-ass dolls."" What he delivers over the next couple of hours is so much more than dining and drinking destinations, and tips on where to buy ""creepy-ass dolls"" (that would be American Girl, at the Grove, for those who are wondering). We drive along famous streets, including Sunset Boulevard, all the while scouring the landscape for real-life stars. Celebrities have been known to hop on the bus for a quick visit -- or so says our guide. We pass the Roosevelt Hotel, ""where JFK would allegedly sneak through the laundry room to hook up with Marilyn Monroe,"" says the announcer on a mounted TV. We cruise down Hollywood Boulevard, ""where celebrities pay $30,000 to have their own stars so homeless people can pee on them,"" our guide says. We turn onto Sunset Boulevard and see the fast-food joint El Pollo Loco, where Brad Pitt got his Hollywood start dressed as a chicken. The journey is a deluge of must-know smut that washes over tourists, taking with it the worries of the world. U.S. troops abroad? Libya? The struggling economy? Pshaw. There are strip clubs to uncover, including the Seventh Veil, where Jordan says Motley Crue shot its ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" video.

"Blacksburg,Va. (CNN) -- A 15-person ad hoc committee at Virginian Tech this week recommended against cutting down a portion of the ""stadium woods,"" a densely wooded area behind the football stadium, to build a new state-of-the-art indoor sports practice facility. The controversy came to a head when environmentalists realized early this year officials planned to chop down the wooded area containing some rare old-growth trees. The Virginia Tech Hokies have the third-longest college bowl game streak in the country, and have sold out every game since 1998. However, they have yet to win a national championship. The athletics department hopes a state-of-the-art facility nearer to the football stadium could help change that. Blueprint plans that have been in the works for over a decade would require chopping down at least 60 trees over the age of 150. Six of the trees have been found to be more than 300 years old. ""The forest is in fact an endangered species in the United States. An old growth forest is,"" Virginia Tech Forestry Professor John Seiler explained, ""It's literally the rarest type of forest structure left in the United States."" However, the University Athletics Department still preferred the plan to cut down about three acres of the woods to make room for the facility, forcing University President Charles W. Steger to appoint the committee to hear arguments and eventually make their recommendation on whether the facility should be built as planned or at an alternate location. ""We'll see what the report has to say and at the end of the day we'll do the right thing,"" Steger told CNN in an interview in May. Committee chair John Randolph told the Board of Visitors Monday it was ""in the university's best interest"" to build the facility in a different location. ""The determining factor in the committee's deliberations and recommendations was the demonstrated social importance of the Stadium Woods,"" Randolph said. Signs urging ""Save Stadium Woods"" were placed in yards throughout Blacksburg and a group called Friends of Stadium Woods created an online petition which has now been signed by more than 10,500 people across the country. The committee suggested that the new state-of-the-art facility instead be built in a location where tennis courts and a roller hockey rink currently stand. According to the committee, over 450 people signed another online petition; this time requesting the courts and rink be replaced before the current ones are built on. ""Alternative sites for the courts and rink have been identified,"" Randolph said. Randolph acknowledges additional cost and design issues may be incurred with the preferred location -- including having to build 20% of the facility underground. So several additional options were presented during Monday's meeting -- some that would still force a small portion of the old growth forest to be cut down. Professor John Seiler hopes the ""no woods impact"" option is the one ultimately chosen by school administrators. ""This is a very, very easy decision,"" Seiler said, ""To athletics, it's just ... slightly less perfect for them. It isn't absolutely right adjacent to the practice fields, its one minute further up the hill."" Included with their recommendations, the committee also suggested the Stadium woods be designated for permanent protection and that a program would be developed to ""enhance its ecological value and benefit"" to the community. They also suggested a review of procedures for future updates to the university master plan to ""safeguard against future controversies of this sort."" It is now up to school administrators, who will review the committee recommendations, then come back to the Board of Visitors with a final plan they will ultimately vote on. There is no set timeline at this point for when that will happen.","Virginia Tech wants to build a new, $20 million indoor sports facility .

"(CNN) -- Every college applicant knows about the ""hardship essay,"" which asks a teenager to write about overcoming an obstacle. Here's a suggested approach: . ""Being a high school senior unnerved by college applications was tough enough until I tried to fill out the Common Application and the site froze, then refused to accept my writing and rejected my teachers' recommendations."" That's right. College application season turned into a nightmare this month as the Common App site crashed just as hundreds of thousands of early applicants got to work. This debacle could have been avoided. More important, it underscores the problems of using a single site to apply to a dozen or more colleges. The Common App, which started in 1975, has been a great tool for students who want to apply efficiently to several colleges. But like everything on the high end of college admissions, it's gotten way out of hand. And now the Great Crash of '13. Guidance counselors talked of students almost in tears. Tech-savvy parents said they jumped in to struggle with clickable images that couldn't be clicked, uploads that wouldn't upload and paragraph breaks that were broken. The nonprofit Common Application organization, which serves more than 500 colleges, blames the problems on a software upgrade (maybe created by the same folks who gave us the software for America's new health insurance?). This excuse, in a business that revolves around unforgiving deadlines, is akin to high school kids stating that the dog ate their homework. Surely the Common App executives tested this software? Surely they knew they were dealing with stressed-out students who get nervous when the system simply slows down a bit? The Common App gurus didn't do themselves any favors with their tweets in the past few days: . -- ""Aware some users are experiencing problems with the PDF previews."" (Duh, as many students would say.) -- ""We are aware of the login issues users are experiencing. Taking steps to address the problem as quickly as possible."" (Thanks for this October 14 message, but some campuses had October 15 deadlines for early apps.) -- ""We've implemented changes to clarify processes surrounding print preview ..."" (Please use Google Translator to put this in English.) As someone who taught high school English, then spent years coaching applicants, I can't believe that sentence comes from one of the most prominent organizations in higher ed. I drill my students to write clearly. Implemented changes to clarify processes? I grade that ""F."" Georgia Tech, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and several other colleges with October 15 deadlines gave students an extra week, and those with November 1 deadlines are talking about extending them, too. Others are trying an alternative, the Universal College Application. Applicants pass around tips: You can upload better from a Mac than a PC. You can insert paragraph breaks into an essay, but it takes several steps. While researching ""Acceptance,"" a book about a wonderful guidance counselor named Gwyeth Smith Jr. (or Smitty), I saw plenty of unnecessary angst in the college process. In too many communities, someone seems to have decided there are 40 or so acceptable campuses. Going anywhere else is seen as losing the education lottery. Smitty, who now works as an independent consultant for applicants, says last week he had a student who was determined to apply to 23 schools. Smitty told the student that was too many, but the parents overruled him. Besides ensuring this student will have to write more than 30 or 40 essays, that means nearly $2,000 in application fees. And for the past few weeks, even those students who did their work ahead of time have been encountering one problem after another. ""Kids are overwhelmingly stressed to begin with, and finding a Common App that won't accept their essays is devastating,"" Smitty told me in between his appointments with frustrated high school seniors on Long Island, New York. He was surprised last month when he attended an admissions conference in Toronto and heard that the Common App folks conceded their program couldn't count words in essays that were uploaded. ""An essay has to be a cut-and-paste to have a word count?"" Smitty said. ""I find that hard to believe in 2013."" There might be an upside to this storm. It's forcing parents and students to have a conversation about the pressure to get into the ""right"" college, and even the more basic pressure to get into college. For several years, I've given speeches at high schools, churches and synagogues. (Here's a sign of the stress in the Northeast: I was even asked to speak at an elementary school. About college admissions.) I urge 12th-graders to consider a gap year, combining working, going to community college and doing public service. Grow up, I say, and take a year to find your passions and to give back to the taxpayers who have done a lot for you. Parents in high-pressure communities usually dismiss that idea. I'm secretly hoping for more delays with the Common App. If kids can't apply to college now, they can't go next year. And that means they'll be forced to take a gap year, which likely will be the best preparation for college of which anyone can dream. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Marcus.","Dave Marcus: The Common App site crashed, leaving students and parents frantic .

"(CNN) -- For not-so-intrepid travelers, cruises are perfect. Outside of getting yourself to the departure port, you don't need to plan anything to have a successful trip. To make that ocean-going vacation as effortless as possible, we've assembled a list of the cushiest cruises departing from the United States. Linblad Expeditions, Alaska cruise . With 340,000 miles of some of the Western Hemisphere's most awe-inspiring coastline, you'll realize why the U.S. government dished out $7.2 million to take Alaska off Russia's hands. True, the scenery had little to do with the controversial purchase then known as ""Seward's Folly,"" but it's now one of the country's greatest assets. One of the most engaging ways to explore this national treasure is with Lindblad Expeditions and its partner, National Geographic. Experts in marine biology, geology and botany take travelers out into the ocean on smaller crafts and provide an intimate look at glaciers, grizzly and marine life. An underwater hydrophone allows guests to listen to the songs of whales, orcas and dolphins. Linblad Expeditions; +1 800 397 3348; starts at $5,990 . Celebrity Cruises, Immersive Wine Cruise . If you want to do the wild West Coast without walking on an ice floe, Celebrity's Immersive Wine Cruises take you to British Columbia, Seattle, San Francisco, Monterey and San Diego, and visit some of the finest wineries in the Pacific Northwest. The tasting doesn't end when cruisers leave dry land -- sommeliers are available to help passengers choose from about 500 selections of wine on board. Celebrity Cruises; +1 888 245 4254; starts at $800 . Azamara Club Cruises, Panama Canal Cruise . Azamara Club Cruises offers a trip that departs from one U.S. coast and arrives on the other, by passing through the Panama Canal. Along the way, the ship hits 26 ports in 12 countries, including Costa Rica, Belize, Mexico, Colombia and Jamaica. At each destination, Azamara provides longer, more immersive excursions than most other cruise lines. The most memorable part of the trip is coasting through 58 miles of waterway that wouldn't exist if tens of thousands of workers hadn't risked or given their lives to build it. Azamara Club Cruises; +1 877 999 9553, call for pricing . Cunard, Queen Mary 2, transatlantic cruise . In 2004, the Queen Mary 2 became the first transatlantic passenger liner built in 35 years. Its classic design and decoration embody an adoration of world travel that predates even her predecessor, the half-sized Queen Elizabeth 2, which reigned from 1969 to 2008. While the eastbound cruise departing from New York City only makes a stop at Southampton, UK, before arriving at Hamburg, Germany, the majestic ship's spa, theater, library, ballroom and planetarium keep you stuffed with things to eat, see and do throughout the nine-day cruise. Cunard; +1 800 728 6273; from $1,600 . American Queen Steamboat Company Mississippi River Cruise . You don't even have to leave the country for some of the world's most luxurious boating excursions.

"(CNN) -- Farmers in Tanzania are helping to conserve threatened forests by cultivating an unlikely crop: butterflies. The Amani Butterly Project is one of the schemes using butterfly farming to help locals supplement their incomes and protect the environment at the same time. The brainchild of American biologist Theron Morgan-Brown, it's based in Tanzania's East Usambara Mountains -- a region known for its biodiversity, but where forests are being cleared to produce charcoal and to open up farmland. ""The main objective was to find an alternative income for the local community in the surrounding village and forest, and also relieve the pressure on the forest of people cutting timber,"" says project manager Amiri Saidi. The butterfly rearing process starts with farmers catching a few female butterflies and transferring them to an enclosure where they can lay eggs on host plants. The farmers then collect the eggs and when they hatch, the caterpillars that emerge are placed on new plants, which must be regularly replaced to satisfy their voracious appetites. The caterpillars continue to feed until they pupate, and are ready to be transported. Green in vogue at Nigeria Fashion Week . The Amani project has been selling pupae to live butterfly exhibits in the United States and Europe for between $1 and $2.50 each. Of that sum, 65% goes directly to the farmers, while another 7% goes to a community development fund that contributes to projects such as building schools and hospitals. Because most tropical butterflies don't live for long, exhibits usually order new pupae every two to three weeks. Farmers keep some pupae from each generation, so they rarely need to catch more female butterflies from the wild, although they sometimes catch new male butterflies to maintain genetic diversity in their farms. The project now uses 250 butterfly farmers, more than half of them women, says Saidi. He says the project's own studies show that because butterfly farmers rely on forests near their communities to provide host plants for their butterfly farms, many farmers now support forest conservation. ""Because butterfly farmers get tangible benefits, they get money, people involved in butterfly farming conserve the area,"" says Saidi. ""They have their own forest area and use the money they are getting for replanting and other activities."" As well as training its own farmers the Amani project has helped train farmers for a butterfly project on the Tanzanian archipelago of Zanzibar. The Zanzibar Butterfly Centre consists of a netted tropical garden that's home to hundreds of butterflies, all bred by local farmers. It was created as a tourist attraction, funded by admission fees, and like the Amani project the aim is to help protect the environment. Congo's erupting volcano boosts tourism . ""A lot of forest is being destroyed in Zanzibar,"" says project manager Rosa Santilli. ""Local people cut down trees to make charcoal to sell. People need it for fuel because gas and electricity is very expensive, so people cook with charcoal. ""The center was set up to stop local people cutting the forest down, and to provide an alternative for them to earn money from."" Santili says the center has trained 17 local farmers to rear the pupae that provide all the center's butterflies. It's not a solution to deforestation, but it is helping, says Santili. ""The butterfly farmers don't make charcoal anymore, so it has stopped that small sector of the community cutting down trees,"" she says. Like the Amani project, the Zanzibar center funds a village development association, which is improving the local water supply. It is also trying to get local people to produce crafts and honey to be sold as souvenirs at the center. But there is a cloud on the horizon. Both the Amani and Zanzibar schemes rely on couriers to transport their pupae to overseas buyers, and they say they have been hit by courier DHL's decision to stop transporting their pupae. Saidi says Amani has been hit especially badly. It now has to transport pupae by air cargo, which dramatically increases their cost to buyers. He says that until the end of 2010 the Amani project was selling a total of 50,000 pupae a year to 13 buyers, but now the project has lost all but one buyer. But DHL says it will be now discussing transport options with both projects, and hopes to find a solution that will let it resume pupae deliveries. The Zanzibar center sees exporting pupae as key to getting more locals trained as butterfly farmers. Santilli says: ""We are hoping to expand to get more farmers involved. We need butterflies for our garden and also to export. If the farmers can export to Europe then the sky's the limit.""","Tanzanian projects training people to farm butterflies .

"(CNN) -- Is baseball hothead David Price right? Are the millions of us who never pitched beyond Little League just a bunch of starstruck wannabes? During the American League Divisional Series, the Tampa Bay Rays star lashed out at the media after giving up seven earned runs in seven innings. ""Nice questions, nerds!"" he hissed at reporters. Then Price got mean. On Twitter, he called Sports Illustrated scribe Tom Verducci a nerd who ""wasn't even a water boy in high school."" He stopped there, passing up the temptation to mock Verducci's prom date or how much he can bench press. Price's snotty attitude exists for one reason. Many of my fellow baseball nuts DO think players are cooler than the rest of us. The fact is, no matter how successful we may be in our professional lives, many of us would instantly trade in our careers for a (your team here) uniform. As my beloved Red Sox battle the Cardinals in the World Series this week, spotting my favorite players outside their natural habitat remains a thrill for me, even though I am old enough to be rookie Xander Bogaerts' dad. Still, I'll appear stoic and resist the urge to ask for a picture or autograph. My inner child is disappointed but my dignity is intact. During a recent business trip to Tampa, my celebrity-seeking was put to the ultimate test. I was staying at the same hotel as the visiting Red Sox; my hunt began the moment I stepped off the plane: . Day One. 1:45 p.m. Tampa International Airport --My friend and I are wearing Sox shirts, prompting our shuttle driver to mention he just took ""a bunch of players with beards"" on a deep sea fishing trip. One of the beards, he says, used to play for the Rays, and he ""couldn't stand up straight"" when it was time to pick them up. Jonny Gomes! I am sitting on the same sweaty seat as Jonny Gomes, the Sox party animal who pulls off the Army helmet look much better than Mike Dukakis. This is the guy who celebrates victory by punting beer cans to the crowd. Day One. 2:30 p.m. Vinoy Renaissance Hotel -- We check in at the front desk and again our Sox shirts spark conversation. The clerk giddily tells us she once worked at an ice cream stand where she'd scooped for ex-Sox outfielder Josh Reddick. I am intrigued, explaining that Reddick is now a 30-home run guy whom the Sox never should have traded to the A's. A few minutes later, as we're walking past a seafood restaurant, an off-duty waitress rushes up to us. ""You'll NEVER guess who I just saw!"" she gushes. It was slugger David Ortiz--not surprisingly, a fabulous tipper. He was my first guess because he is a larger-than-life caricature who can't hide behind sunglasses. I had been in Florida for only an hour and already three strangers felt compelled to share their Sox sightings with anyone pretending to care. I do care. I care about Reddick's favorite ice cream flavor and whether Big Papi ordered the swordfish or sea bass. And now I want some sightings of my own. Being able to identify players in their civilian clothes, without the help of baseball cards, is an intoxicating game. So far, all I've got is footprints. My hotel is the red carpet for Sox sightings, but also a forbidden zone. No Autographs/No Photography signs are posted everywhere to ""protect the safety and privacy of all our resort guests."" Night One. 11:30 p.m. Hotel Lobby -- I spot a diminutive bearded guy briskly walking toward me. It's second baseman Dustin Pedroia, the 2008 AL MVP. ""Hey, good game tonight!"" I say. Dustin is wearing headphones and could have pretended to be absorbed by the music. But he turns back, stares at me with the same intensity he reserves for Justin Verlander, and says ""Thanks."" It was ""thanks"" with a period, not an exclamation point. But it was a long day and he certainly didn't lack any enthusiasm on the field. And then, just like in ""Field of Dreams,"" he vanishes. There's an inherent awkwardness in fan-player meetings for both parties. We feel like we ""know"" them and briefly suspend the reality that we're strangers. Only Ortiz and Pedroia don't have posters of us on their bedroom walls. If the opportunity existed for them to sit on the couch and watch a live video of us at work, they'd be bored. The goal is to avoid becoming comedian Chris Farley's obsessed fanboy character from ""Saturday Night Live."" Farley meeting Paul McCartney: . Farley: You remember when you were with the Beatles? McCartney: Yes. (Awkward Pause) Farley: That was awesome! Day Two. 2 p.m. Hotel Lobby -- Near the front desk's complimentary jellybean bar, I see the greatest Red Sox pitcher of all time, the retired Pedro Martinez, blankly staring in my direction. I give him a friendly nod, the kind guys silently exchange in the halls at work or at the gym. He doesn't pick up on the signal, so I don't bother to tell him that the jellybeans are free. Free! Then, just like a regular person, Pedro checks into his room. I never saw Pedro again. Rest assured, I don't need any self-esteem counseling about my failure to make the Major Leagues. I buy into the ""Field of Dreams"" Moonlight Graham message that there are far more important things in life than baseball. But as I watch the World Series, forgive me if I temporarily transform into a Chris Farley fanboy. And if I'm lucky enough to score tickets, I know exactly what to yell to Dustin Pedroia during batting practice: ""Hey Dusty, remember when we met late at night in that hotel lobby and I said, 'Great game!' and you said 'thanks'? That was awesome!"" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Darren Garnick.","Pitcher David Price mocked reporters as ""'nerds."" Darren Garnick says: guilty as charged .

"(CNN) -- A high-profile defector from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime fled the country because he is outraged over the government's brutality, an activist told CNN. Omar al Muqdad, a Syrian journalist and opposition activist, said he spoke to Brig. Gen. Manaf Tlas on Thursday night during an interview on Skype. Tlas is a Republican Guard military commander, the son of a former defense minister and possibly the most senior Sunni in a power structure dominated by the Alawite minority. He escaped from the Syrian city of Rastan to Turkey with the help of the Maher Noaimi Brigade of the rebel Free Syrian Army, al Muqdad said. But his whereabouts at present are not known, said al Muqdad, who once worked as a translator and journalist for CNN. A Western diplomat who reported the defection said Tlas has been estranged from the regime over the killing of Sunnis. Al Muqdad said Tlas passed on similar sentiments, calling the regime brutal and al-Assad a dictator. He said Tlas said he left the regime because he doesn't want to be involved in any actions that would harm Syrians. Tlas said he's not going to join the opposition now, al Muqdad said. But a U.S. official who is not authorized to speak on the record said if Tlas did join the insurgency, it would be ""significant."" Reports of Tlas' defection first surfaced Thursday, and Western officials are saying he is on his way to Paris. His father, former Defense Minister Mustafa Tlas, and the rest of his family are in Paris, the official said. Syria has been engulfed in nearly 16 months of unrest, resulting in thousands of deaths. Manaf Tlas' defection comes as government assaults against protesters led to a nationwide uprising. His departure is regarded as a stunning blow to the embattled regime. ""He's an inside confidant of Assad. So it counts that even an insider thinks it's time to go,"" said one Western official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Pentagon spokesman Capt. John Kirby said the ""crack in the inner circle"" is ""significant"" because of Tlas' position and ties with the Assad family. ""We don't believe this defection should be taken lightly,"" he said. Andrew Tabler, Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said it's ""by far the biggest defection."" ""This is a good-sized step in the right direction,"" he said The Tlas family knows ""how the place is wired."" Rafif Jouejati, spokeswoman for the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria, called the development ""quite significant."" ""It signals that the domino effect of defections is speeding up as longtime regime supporters and collaborators realize that Assad's ship is sinking fast. Expect more defections in the coming days as the regime accelerates its scorched-earth policy in a desperate attempt to destroy as much as possible before falling apart,"" she told CNN. Jeffrey White, a defense fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said the defection ""raises questions about the cohesions of his brigade and division."" White recently wrote an essay describing the mounting pressures on the Syrian military, including the growing opposition clout and defections. He told CNN on Friday that the ""defection process is accelerating somewhat and that we are getting more reports of higher-ranking officers leaving."" Tlas had been ""the commander of an important regime protection unit, a component of the Republican Guard Division, whose main responsibility in the current conflict has been the defense of Damascus,"" White said. The defection reflects two important trends, he said. One is that many of the higher-ranking defectors are staff officers and medical officers. Tlas, in contrast, is from a combat unit. ""If we start seeing more defections from the higher ranks of combat units that will be significant,"" White said. The move also might indicate that the regime ""cannot count on the Sunnis it has so far kept in the fold."" ""It will create suspicions within the regime about 'loyalist' Sunnis and 'loyalist' Sunnis will be wondering what the regime has in store for them. Some will likely split, if they can find a safe path for themselves and their families. Manaf's defection will undoubtedly heighten the awareness of the regime's security personnel."" Ted Kattouf, a former U.S. ambassador to Syria, said the defection was ""psychologically"" important, ""but it's not going to bring down the regime."" He said a ""much bigger blow"" would be the defection of an Alawite senior officer. Joshua Landis, a Syria expert at the University of Oklahoma, said Thursday in a post on his blog Syria Comment that if Tlas has indeed fled the country, ""the regime will be thrown back on its heels."" Tlas ""was a close confidant of Bashar from his earliest days and part of his inner circle,"" Landis said. And he ""supported a policy of negotiation, flexibility and compromise"" but ""was overruled by the military leadership and has since looked for a way out."" For example, Tlas had been ordered to solve problems in the restive Damascus suburban towns of Harasta and Douma, Landis said. ""He did a good job by negotiating with the opposition leaders in both suburbs, agreeing that both government forces and opposition would pull back,"" Landis said. But, Landis said, the ""Alawi leadership said 'no, that is not how we are going to do this.' They pushed him aside and came down like a ton of bricks on the opposition in both neighborhoods, in an effort to assert state authority and crush the uprising through military means."" Tlas is ""perhaps the most senior Sunni in the regime because he was a close friend of Bashar,"" Landis wrote. ""For 16 months the opposition has been complaining that elite Sunnis have not defected. That complaint can now, officially, be put to rest if the stories of Manaf's flight prove to be true. In March it was rumored that he had led with his father and brother, but those stories were false,"" he wrote. Tlas exudes charisma, and Landis describes him as ""smart, dashing and cunning."" ""Manaf is as handsome as a movie star and carried a lot of authority. He was a true military guy and had spent his entire life in the military, unlike Bashar. People close to him say that when he walked into a room, all eyes turned to him. Not only did women find him attractive, but men did as well. He carried himself with an air of self-confidence and authority,"" Landis said. The Tlas family has been part of the Syrian power structure during the tenure of Bashar and his father, Hafez Assad. ""When foreign statesmen or Syrians thought of a Sunni who could possibly take power, Manaf had to be at the top of the list or very close to the top,"" he said. ""Manaf is respected by Bashar's generation and a military leader."" There has been a lot of buzz about the development on the streets of Damascus and the pages of Facebook. One man wrote it's important because the Tlas family wasn't just pro-regime, ""they are the regime."" Another activist said, ""You idiots, defect before it's too late. Tlas saved himself at the very last moment."" While opposition voices welcome the move, they voiced suspicion and scorn. ""Should we work with him? No, never,"" said one. Another said, ""(H)e and his father and brother should return the money they stole from the Syrian people first."" This comment is an apparent reference to Manaf Tlas' brother Firas, a businessman. Firas Tlas has been in favor of reform in Syria. He told reporters in 2005 there was a ""huge expectation"" from Syrians of economic change. CNN's Barbara Starr, Pam Benson and journalist Shiyar Sayed Mohamad contributed to this report.","NEW: Activist says Brig. Gen. Manaf Tlas doesn't plan to join the opposition at present .

"(CNN) -- A major missing piece threatens to hold up a security deal between Afghanistan and the United States: President Hamid Karzai's signature. The Afghan President told U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice Monday that he isn't ready to approve the Bilateral Security Agreement yet and ""outlined new conditions for signing the agreement,"" according to a statement released by the White House. Rice told Karzai that delaying the deal -- which would allow for the presence of a limited number of U.S. troops beyond next year -- until after Afghanistan's 2014 elections ""is not viable,"" the White House said. ""It would not provide the United States and NATO allies the clarity necessary to plan for a potential post-2014 military presence,"" the statement said. ""Nor would it provide Afghans with the certainty they deserve regarding their future, in the critical months preceding elections."" So what happens if Karzai doesn't sign it soon? U.S. and NATO troops could pull out of Afghanistan earlier than expected. ""The U.S. would have no choice but to initiate planning for a post-2014 future in which there would be no U.S. or NATO troop presence in Afghanistan,"" the White House said. On Sunday a vast majority of 2,500 Afghan elders voted to recommend the joint security agreement with the United States and urged Karzai to sign it before the end of the year. Karzai had said he would follow their recommendation under one condition -- that U.S. forces do not conduct house raids. ""If U.S. military forces conduct military operations on Afghan homes even one more time, then there will be no BSA and we won't sign it,"" Karzai said on Sunday. ""They should give assurance about this to us before I sign it."" But then he moved the goal posts, refusing to sign until after the presidential election next spring. His last-minute decision to delay signing the pact was both classic Karzai -- a tricky negotiator to the last -- and a breakaway move that provides political cover for any U.S. officials who prefer the so-called zero option of leaving no U.S. troops in Afghanistan. It's a decision that could also have political implications for Karzai in Afghanistan, shoring up his anti-American credentials ahead of next year's presidential election. Karzai himself cannot stand again for president under the current constitution, but he remains highly influential in Afghan politics, whose entire cast he has helped shape since the U.S. invasion in 2001. Abdullah Abdullah, who ran against Karzai in 2009 before dropping out of the race amid allegations of election fraud, told CNN's ""Amanpour"" on Monday that political motivations are clouding Karzai's approach. ""These negotiations between Afghanistan and the United States are being delayed not because of the content of the Bilateral Security Agreement,"" Abdullah said, ""but primarily because of the personal feelings or personal interests of President Karzai."" CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, Christiane Amanpour and Masoud Popolzai contributed to this report.","President Hamid Karzai says he won't sign a security deal until after elections .

"(CNN) -- The United States -- in partnership with its ally Canada -- spied during a pair of major 2010 summits of world leaders in Toronto, CBC reported, citing top secret documents obtained from whistleblower Edward Snowden. Both the G8 and G20 summits were held in June 2010 in Canada's most populated city. And both times, America's National Security Agency conducted widespread surveillance that was ""closely coordinated with the Canadian partner,"" according to CBC's account of a briefing note from the U.S. spy agency. The multi-day spying operation focused at making sure meeting sites were safe, protecting against terrorist threats and ""providing support to policymakers,"" a NSA briefing document states, according to the Canadian news outlet. The National Security Agency and the office of Director of National Intelligence, President Barack Obama's top intelligence adviser, did not respond Thursday to CNN requests for comment on the CBC report. Ottawa's Communications Security Establishment Canada, or CSEC, did not comment to the CBC, according to that news outlet. When similar reports have surfaced in the past. U.S. government officials have pointed to the Obama-ordered review of America's intelligence gathering -- which gained steam after reports that German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been spied on -- but refused to comment on specific claims. But they also have not backed away from the idea that the U.S. spies, just like other nations do. ""As we have made clear, ... the United States gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations,"" said NSA spokeswoman Caitlin Haden in October, when the Merkel reports stirred tensions between traditional allies in Germany and the United States. The new CBC reporting does not specify which world leaders, if any, were targeted during the G8 and G20 summits, or what specific information may have been obtained. Nor does the Canadian news outlet's account of the NSA documents spell out what role, if any, the CSEC had in it. If that Canadian agency had been complicit in snooping on anyone -- be they Canadians or foreign nationals -- without a warrant, it could violate that North American nation's laws, the CBC reports. G8 summits are meetings of world leaders from the Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, the European Union and the United States. G20 summits incorporate a larger group, traditionally taking place once or twice each year. During these meetings, leaders traditionally discuss a wide range of important and sometimes hot-button issues. At the end of 2010's G8 summit in Toronto, for example, the group issued a final statement focusing on recovery from a global economic crisis while also criticizing Iran and North Korea. The fact that Snowden is linked to the CBC's report isn't a big surprise. The now 30-year-old worked as an information technology contractor for the U.S. government. He collected information on his native country's spy programs, then exposed them to media outlets such as the Guardian and the Washington Post. Some of the reported leaks -- like that the National Security Agency mined phone and Internet metadata from thousands of people inside and outside of the United States -- put the Obama administration on the defensive, trying to justify its spying programs while assuring Americans of their privacy. Others, like the claims that Merkel was spied on for years, forced Washington to do damage control with leaders of countries overseas. U.S. authorities have charged Snowden with espionage and theft of government property. But they haven't arrested him: Instead, he is in Russia, which on August 1 granted him asylum for one year. This isn't the first time that documents from Snowden have been linked to G20 spying. Britain's electronic intelligence agency monitored G20 delegates' phones and tried to capture their passwords during a summit held there in 2009, the Guardian newspaper reported, citing documents obtained from Snowden.","CBC says it obtained a top secret NSA document from Edward Snowden .

"(CNN) -- It's hard to believe it's been 30 years since E.T. and Elliott took a ride across the moon. As Henry Thomas, who played Elliott in the movie ""E.T.,"" said, ""ironically enough, even with today's technology and knowledge of movie magic, people still ask me how they made the bike fly. They used a blue screen and rear projection. It's an old trick."" Steven Spielberg's ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"" was the biggest blockbuster of 1982, winning four Academy Awards. It remains the fourth most-successful movie of all time in the U.S. ""E.T."" even surpassed ""Star Wars"" as the highest-grossing film of all time and wasn't beat until another Spielberg film came along: 1993's ""Jurassic Park."" One of the reasons ""E.T."" remains timeless is because it wasn't supposed to be an effects-heavy film. Memorable visuals, like the bicycle scene, were seamlessly woven in. Spielberg didn't want audiences ""ooohing"" and ""aaahing"" over special effects. He simply wanted it to look like he'd shot a perfect night moon, because he did just that. That was the real moon. The visual effects team spent several nights charting the moon and scouting locations for the perfect spot in the forest at the perfect time. Thomas, who was 10 years old when he made ""E.T.,"" said he'll never forget the distinct smell of the Culver City soundstage. ""Soundstages have a very particular smell,"" he explained, ""and to this day whenever I have that, it takes me back to those days, because those are pretty much the first memories I have of working on a set."" Thomas, now 41, described the smell as ""a combination of new lumber, cigarette smoke and fog machines. They used a lot of atmospheric fog."" He also recalled eating Reese's Pieces by the fistful. In the film, Elliott lures E.T. into his house by leaving a trail of the candy. ""I made myself sick from eating them because we always had those 2-pound bags lying around,"" Thomas said. ""They were set dressing in Elliott's room, so in between takes, I was constantly eating those things. In fact, when I saw Steven -- we did an interview together earlier this year -- and when I saw him, I said something about how I ate too many of those things, and he said, 'Oh, yeah, I know you did. You were eating those way too much.' "" Producers originally wanted to use M&Ms, but parent company Mars Inc. passed. On a more sentimental note, Thomas believes that the reason ""E.T."" still resonates with audiences today is because ""people respond to the message of compassion and friendship. It's a simple, very human thing."" Actress Dee Wallace, who played Elliott's mother, Mary, said, ""it's our 'Wizard of Oz,' and it's something that every generation wants to pass down to the next generation and share with it and tell the stories about."" Wallace said she believes ""E.T."" remains a global cultural phenomenon because ""it's all about love and keeping your heart open. And when you do that, even the little alien from outer space can be your best friend."" In a recent interview featured on the new 30th anniversary ""E.T."" Blu-ray/DVD, Spielberg said that the idea for ""E.T."" came to him when he was directing 1977's ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" He thought of doing a scenario where the alien didn't return to the mothership. He'd also wanted to make a film exploring how divorce impacts pre-teens. (The director himself endured his own parents' divorce when he was 15.) So in collaboration with screenwriter Melissa Mathison, Spielberg combined those two ideas to create ""E.T.'s"" sweet story about a lonesome boy rescued -- by an alien -- from the sadness of his parents' divorce. Referring to ""E.T."" as ""the most personal thing I'd done as a director,"" Spielberg stated that his intention all along was to tell the tale from the kids' points of view. Except for Wallace's character, ""all the other adults are either silhouetted, shot at a long distance or from the waist down,"" said Spielberg, ""until the critical moment where E.T. is dying, and then for the first time, we see the character of Keys."" Spielberg also noted that working with Thomas, a then-6-year-old Drew Barrymore (Gertie) and 15-year-old Robert McNaughton (Michael) made him want to be a father. The director recalled viewing a number of early concept sketches before committing to E.T.'s look. He was adamant that the little alien not resemble a monster. Interestingly enough, the director envisioned a combination of Albert Einstein, Ernest Hemingway and Carl Sandberg, because he wanted E.T.'s oversized eyes to look ""as wizened and as sad as those icons."" E.T. began shooting in September 1981 and wrapped that December. It was filmed under the code name ""A Boy's Life"" because Spielberg feared plagiarism of the plot. Actors were instructed to read the script behind closed doors; everyone on-set had to wear an ID card. Most of E.T.'s voice work was performed by an elderly woman named Pat Welsh, whose two-pack a day smoking habit gave her voice the deep quality Spielberg had envisioned. However, there were 18 contributors to E.T.'s voice in total. To create sounds ranging from E.T. talking and breathing to snorting and drunkenly burping, the contributors included Spielberg himself, sound effects creator Ben Burtt's sleeping wife who had a cold, a burp from a University of Southern California film professor, raccoons, sea otters, horses and actress Debra Winger's signature husky voice. (You can't make this stuff up.) Winger also has a cameo in ""E.T."" during the trick-or-treating scene. She's dressed as a doctor wearing a monster mask carrying a poodle in a clown costume. (You really can't make this stuff up.) Spielberg gave Winger the ""E.T."" script and had her record every single one of E.T.'s lines into a tape recorder. In the scene where government agents have taken over Elliott's home, real doctors from USC Medical Center were recruited to play the doctors who try to save E.T., because Spielberg felt that actors talking about technical medical matters didn't seem natural. In addition, Spielberg cut a scene featuring Harrison Ford as the headmaster at Elliott's school. Spielberg recalled receiving ""stacks"" of congratulatory telegrams upon ""E.T.'s"" premiere during the Cannes Film Festival in June 1982, but the most treasured one came from Francois Truffaut, who said, ""You belong here more than me."" At a White House screening, Spielberg sat next to President Reagan and noted that ""the president's face became very childlike. His mouth was open, his eyes were wide, and I suddenly saw a 10-year-old boy."" Thomas added that he is ""pleasantly surprised"" by the film's resonating success. ""I never really thought when we were filming that it would ever be a success. It literally took until about 10 years ago for me to realize, 'Wow! This ""E.T."" thing isn't going away.' ""","Steven Spielberg's ""E.T."" is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Colombia's FARC guerrilla group has released an American hostage who spent more than four months in captivity, officials said Sunday. The leftist rebels captured Kevin Scott Sutay on June 20, when he was backpacking through Colombia. He was released to representatives from the Red Cross, Cuba and Norway in a rural area of southeastern Colombia, then handed over to U.S. officials Sunday morning at Bogota's airport, the governments of Cuba and Norway said in a statement. Sutay's case drew attention from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who pushed for his release during a trip last month to Cuba. Sutay served in the U.S. Army from November 2009 to March 2013, including a year-long tour in Afghanistan, according to the U.S. Defense Department. He is from Willow Spring, North Carolina, and has won a number of awards, including an Army Commendation Medal and a National Defense Service Medal. The Pentagon lists his rank as private. ""The United States is profoundly grateful to the Government of Colombia and commends its tireless efforts to secure his release,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement Sunday. ""We offer special thanks to President Juan Manuel Santos for his assistance. We also appreciate the contributions of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the Governments of Norway and Cuba in securing Mr. Sutay's freedom."" The FARC, Latin America's oldest guerrilla force, is currently engaged in peace talks with the Colombian government. In July, the group said it would release Sutay in a ""gesture"" to advance the talks. Norway and Cuba are helping to mediate the talks, which are taking place in Havana. The FARC, whose name in Spanish means the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, began fighting Colombia's government in the 1960s. There have been sporadic peace talks between the rebels and the government since the 1980s. The last attempt failed in 2002. Kidnapping government forces and civilians has been a key strategy of the rebel group. Last year, the rebels said they would release government prisoners and stop kidnapping civilians for money. The rebels did not address the fate of its civilian captives then, nor did it renounce kidnapping for political purposes. Dramatic rescues, escapes and hostage handovers have revealed harsh conditions in jungle camps, including stories of prisoners chained to trees, grueling marches between hideouts, torrential rain and blistering sun. After taking Sutay hostage, the FARC described him as a mercenary. But despite Sutay's military background, Jackson said last month that the Army veteran had peaceful motives for visiting Colombia. ""The fact is, he is a tourist,"" Jackson said. On Sunday, an International Committee of the Red Cross doctor said Sutay was in good physical condition to travel. Officials said he would reunite with his family soon. Freed Colombian hostages carry pets tamed in the jungle . CNN's Patrick Oppmann reported from Havana. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta. CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.","NEW: Red Cross: Kevin Scott Sutay is in good physical condition to travel .

"(CNN) -- Even as gaming begins to challenge television as a leading mass entertainment medium, the industry continues to struggle with the serialized model that's made broadcast programming a nightly must-see for many. But a new breed of episodic games, designed to be enjoyed in short, sequential spurts, is looking to make its mark on home entertainment -- one bite-sized, downloadable installment at a time. Phoenix Online Studios' ""The Silver Lining,"" a free, fan-made tribute to Sierra's classic ""King's Quest"" fantasy adventures, kicks off July 10 for the PC. The classically styled ""point-and click"" puzzle-solving tale offers players the first chance to revisit with hero King Graham since 1998's middling ""Mask of Eternity."" Future episodes will also be complimentary and are due for release throughout 2010. But beyond the fact it's a homebrew labor of love that single-handedly resurrects a dormant cult classic, the title is also significant for several reasons. It points to growing signs of life for the once-popular adventure genre, which fell on hard times during the mid-'90s, following the rise of first-person shooters and action-oriented outings. Debuting with the approval of license holder Activision, the game also illustrates the potential ability of homebrew titles to rekindle public interest in even the hoariest old series. But most importantly, following other successful running properties such as ""Sam & Max"" and ""Tales of Monkey Island"" (other classic adventures enjoying an unexpected resurrection), it points to episodic games' growing viability in a digital world. ""All platforms are now moving towards episodic content -- we're seeing it on the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live, WiiWare and even the iPhone and iPad,"" says Cesar Bittar, producer/designer on ""The Silver Lining."" ""Just like a TV show, it keeps you coming back. We feature a new setting in every episode, with new characters, new puzzles and new adventures, while at the same time moving forward the underlying plot that ties it all together."" It also makes good business sense, explains Bjorn Larsson, CEO of Legendo Entertainment, whose episodic arcade air combat series ""Pearl Harbor Trilogy"" debuts for $7 on WiiWare as of July 5. ""The episodic model allows us to charge less, focus on higher quality per title and better respond to player feedback between releases,"" he says. ""With boxed products, it's either go big or go home -- there's no room for risk. Episodic lowers barriers to entry for both developers and customers, and lets game makers take more chances."" But outside of a few breakout success stories such as ""Half-Life 2: Episode 1,"" the field of episodic game publishing largely remains an unknown quantity. Several prominent earlier releases, including ""American McGee's Grimm"" and ""Majestic,"" failed to attract a significant audience despite backing from Turner Broadcasting and Electronic Arts, respectively. But I'd argue that these titles predate streaming game delivery's rise to mainstream prominence and the economic downturn, which has forced value-minded shoppers to turn online for smaller, more affordable gaming experiences. With marquee outings such as ""Sonic the Hedgehog 4"" due for release in multiple chunks, and massive multiplayer online games already wooing fans with episodic updates, this approach may yet persevere. ""Even blockbuster games are becoming more episodic in nature,"" says Larsson. ""It just so happens that we call updates for titles like 'Grand Theft Auto IV' and 'Alan Wake' downloadable content (DLC) instead.""","""The Silver Lining"" is a free, fan-made tribute to Sierra's ""King's Quest""

"(CNN) -- More than a week after a video showing what appears to be a Saudi man beating a migrant worker was posted on the Internet, a government official questioned its authenticity. ""There is no proof this is real yet,"" said Maj. Gen. Mansour Al-Turki, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, in a telephone interview on Tuesday. ""The police are still investigating and trying to verify the video clip."" The video, which was posted October 27 to YouTube, had received more than 127,000 views by Tuesday. In a telephone interview with CNN, Al-Turki called on anyone with knowledge of the video to contact authorities. ""Nobody has actually reported this incident to the police yet,"" he said. ""And nobody has come to police claiming to be a victim of the abuse."" In addition, he said, no evidence has emerged to indicate that the incident occurred in Saudi Arabia or involved a Saudi. ""Just because it may seem to be a Saudi man in the clip doesn't mean that it actually is a Saudi,"" he said. In the one-minute and 53-second video, a man wearing an orange jumpsuit, his right eye swollen, appears seated on the floor of a room as another man -- dressed in white -- yells at him, initially striking him in the head with his open hand. A shaky video shot by someone out of camera view documents the incident. Government officials told CNN last week they believed the aggressor was a Saudi man who was angry because he thought the man in orange -- perhaps a worker -- had spoken to his wife. ""Why did you come here when she was here?"" he asks in what sounds like Saudi-accented Arabic. ""I swear I didn't mean it,"" pleads the man, whose clothes and accent appear to be those of a migrant laborer, adding, ""I swear to God I didn't know."" As the questioning continues, the man in white -- slapping his victim -- demands to know why he would dare contact his wife. The slapping then grows in ferocity to include kicks and blows to the head and body with what appears to be a leather strap or belt. ""Sit down! Kneel down!"" yells the man as the flogging continues. He then asks the victim if he wants to die. ""No!"" the man screams. Officials said they did not know where the incident took place, but were investigating. Women who defied Saudi driving ban fear repercussions . The Saudi government-backed Human Rights Commission has condemned the incident. ""We are taking this very seriously and are looking into it with Saudi security,"" said the commission's Mohammed Al-Madi. ""We are doing our utmost to ensure the accused abuser is arrested and tried. We are also doing everything we can to find the abused man, so that we can help him in any way."" Another Saudi government-backed human rights group, the National Society for Human Rights, is also investigating. ""We don't know where it took place, but it is under investigation and we'll release details in a few days' time,"" said Mifleh Al-Qahtani, president of the society, last week. The incident is not unique. Global human rights groups have documented widespread abuse of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia. According to Human Rights Watch, more than 9 million migrants work in Saudi Arabia, making up more than half the work force. ""Many suffer multiple abuses and labor exploitation, sometimes amounting to slavery-like conditions,"" the rights group said in July. ""The kafala, or sponsorship, system ties migrant workers' residency permits to 'sponsoring' employers, whose written consent is required for workers to change employers or leave the country,"" the rights group said. ""Employers often abuse this power in violation of Saudi law to confiscate passports, withhold wages and force migrants to work against their will or on exploitative terms."" Human Rights Watch Saudi researcher Adam Coogle said that ""Saudi Arabia needs to get serious about protecting migrant workers by providing adequate avenues to justice and mechanisms of redress."" Saudi preacher sentenced to 8 years, 600 lashes for killing 5-year-old daughter . Migrant laborers elsewhere in the Middle East face similar problems. ""Nobody can come into the Arab states or in the Middle East without a sponsor,"" says Azfar Khan, with the International Labor Organization. Migrant workers are routinely asked to surrender their passports, which can leave them vulnerable to abuse, he said. ""When the employer has that kind of power, then they can dictate the working conditions,"" Khan said. ""Whether it's a question of the wage rates, whether it's a question of the work time."" Rights activists say the problem is getting worse.","""There is no proof this is real yet,"" says Saudi Interior Ministry spokesman .

"(CNN) -- The growth of e-commerce in China has outpaced that of western countries during the past five years. This is largely due to the rapid growth of Internet users, improved online payments, increasing coverage and improving services. Such a trend will continue in the next five years with sales volume predicted to remain at 27% cost of goods sold. Among all the e-commerce business models, business-to-consumer e-commerce is outgrowing others due to its credibility, scale, and services variety and scope. By 2017, business-to-consumer e-commerce in China is predicted to double its share and reach 46% of the total online sale, according to the China Internet Network Information Center. Yihaodian's fast growth illustrates this trend. In the five years since its launch in July 2008, Yihaodian has increased its selection from 3,000 stock-keeping units to over 2 million, fulfillment centers from one in Shanghai to 17 in seven cities, revenue from 4 million yuan to over 6 billion yuan, and employees from 40 people to over 9,000. Yihaodian, which started as an online supermarket by offering mostly fast-moving consumer products, now boasts categories ranging from consumer electronics, apparel, books to mom and baby products. China, in its current state, lends itself perfectly to e-commerce. The rising incomes of its massive population pave the foundation for a growing user base and this population's density and residential infrastructure allow for efficient logistics. And that's only the beginning. China's Internet user penetration is barely 43% compared to the United States, which is near 80%, and its online shopping penetration is less than 40% of its Internet user base, about half of the U.S. If these statistics reach the U.S. levels, e-commerce in China will triple its scale. 1. Characteristics of Chinese e-commerce . China's e-commerce industry has many unique characteristics, some a result of its nascent state and some a result of China's intrinsic cultural behaviors. Yihaodian exemplifies several of these characteristics. Cash on delivery (COD) is still a popular means of payment due to lack of trust in both online payment systems and the e-commerce providers themselves. However, when people start to gain trust through trial purchases, they shift towards online payment. When we launched Yihaodian in 2008, we had more than 70% of orders paying COD, but now it is less than 20%. Last mile delivery is mostly done on mopeds and motorcycles due to dense city traffic and the high cost of delivery by trucks. The logistics industry is very fragmented in China, with the likes of UPS and Fedex in China still unable to provide nationwide coverage and quality service. Many large e-commerce companies have chosen to build their own last mile delivery capabilities to ensure a better customer experience and to facilitate faster growth. In 2011, Yihaodian started our own last mile delivery alongside 30 third party logistics partnerships, allowing us to cover the entire nation. Such a decision was based on the fact that more than 60% of our customers' complaints were centered around delivery services. Very soon, our own last mile delivery services started to bear fruit with a significantly improved customer experience and a 10% improvement in our CSAT (customer satisfaction) score. As our order density increases over time, our delivery cost also declines. In 2012, we launched the Service by Yihaodian (SBY) model to provide our merchants with logistics, marketing, platform, and data services. Through SBY, our last mile delivery fleet not only serves our own customers, but also merchants who sell through their own website or through other marketplace platforms. This has further helped us reduce our last mile delivery costs. Chinese shoppers' behavior is quite different from western countries. For example, online shoppers in the U.S. are used to opening one window at a time and flipping back and forth via navigation buttons, but Chinese online shoppers prefer that each click opens a new window allowing them to navigate a site by jumping between several windows. The user interface of e-commerce websites in the U.S. are usually very simple and clean with plenty of images, but Chinese shoppers favor crowded websites with information and links all packed into one page providing the impression of a high-energy shopping atmosphere. Yihaodian's first homepage was simple and clean mimicking that of such model websites in the western countries, but after receiving our users' feedback, we quickly made changes. In general, Chinese consumers are very price sensitive and right now, Chinese e-commerce is primarily a promotion driven business. Shoppers do not yet value the concept of ""time is money."" Whereas, in the western countries, shoppers are willing to pay considerable fees for expedited delivery, this behavior in China is rare. 2. Challenges faced by multi-national companies . Not many successes for multi-national Internet companies (not only e-commerce companies) can be found in China. Failed or struggling examples include eBay, Google, Yahoo and Groupon. Reasons include: a) Insufficient understanding of Chinese consumers' shopping behavior, simply copying global business models to fit China's market; b) Management is not localized, not adapting for local competition; c) Higher operational cost than local companies due to compliance and operational overhead; d) Improper organizational structure, resulting in low decision efficiency. E-commerce is a fiercely competitive field, needing much faster and dynamic decisions and local management teams need to be more empowered to respond to the dynamics of the local market. Yihaodian received an investment by Walmart in 2011, establishing our strategic partnership. We share resources in sourcing, logistics, e-commerce technology, and private label products. This partnership has helped Yihaodian to provide Chinese consumers with more choices, better service and even better prices. It is more beneficial for multi-national companies and brands to conduct e-commerce in China through strategic partnerships or through an e-commerce solution provider to ensure a higher success rate. 3. Trends in e-commerce in China . China's e-commerce industry is experiencing a transition from online shopping as more of a niche market towards online shopping becoming a lifestyle. It is evolving from tasting new, special, and hard-to-find products to buying daily consumption needs such as food, drinks, toothpastes and shampoos. Mobile commerce is growing at an even faster rate. Consumers using mobile apps exhibit different buying behavior from those using personal computers. For example, Yihaodian's traffic on personal computers and on mobile apps peak at different hours of the day and different days of the week. Our mobile traffic peaks in the evenings and weekends while personal computer traffic peaks in the early afternoons and during weekdays. Orders on apps are usually smaller, but with a higher frequency and people using both devices are more loyal and sticky. E-commerce in China is also rapidly penetrating third and fourth tier cities, predominantly due to growing Internet penetration, a local shortage of shopping malls and supermarkets, and an overall lack of available products. Social commerce is also starting to blossom in China. People trust their friends, opinion leaders and fellow consumers. The advancement of Weibo and social networking sites has accelerated this. Yihaodian started social commerce five years ago by embedding our website into a well-know social networking site Tianya. Yihaodian's official Sina Weibo site has attracted over 2 million fans and some of this site's marketing events have resulted in over one million message forwards. There is also a trend of integration in the Internet world in China. In the past, we have independent portals: search sites, navigation sites, game sites, social networks, and e-commerce, but many are being integrated to provide customers with one-stop service. On November 11, 2012, China's e-commerce industry single handedly created a nationwide promotions holiday which we referred to as ""Single's Day."" Online sales reached 30% of total national retail, a number that will no doubt become the norm in the near future. We are fortunate to witness this change and proud to be a part of making this happen.","By 2017, business-to-consumer e-commerce in China is predicted to double its share .

"(CNN) -- The man extradited to Florida for writing, publishing and selling a controversial book considered a ""how-to"" for pedophiles pleaded no contest to criminal charges in exchange for two years' probation, authorities said Thursday. Phillip Greaves was arrested in his home state of Colorado in December and extradited to Polk County, Florida. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said at the time his detectives were able to establish jurisdiction in the case by conducting an undercover operation, buying a copy of the book ""The Pedophile's Guide to Love and Pleasure: A Child-Lover's Code of Conduct,"" through the mail. Greaves even autographed it. Police paid $50 for the book, which they received on December 8. Greaves and his book gained national attention last year after Amazon.com defended selling the book on its website despite angry comments and threats of boycotts from thousands of people. The book was removed from the website in early November. Officials said the book talks about safe sex and avoiding injury to children, grooming and preparing children for sex and teaching children how to lie to their parents. Judd said last year Greaves' book outlines a ""code of ethics"" that shows pedophiles how to look for the most vulnerable children. Greaves told reporters after his arrest the book could be used as a guide to rehabilitating pedophiles and instead of teaching them how to avoid arrest, teaches them to avoid illegal actions. Asked if he is a pedophile, Greaves said, ""I only have sex with grown-ups."" He said he has no children and ""I don't keep children around my house."" On Thursday, as he was leaving jail, Greaves told CNN affiliate WESH he still supports the sale of the book. ""I don't think I did anything wrong,"" he said. ""It backfired on me."" According to the pre-arranged plea deal announced in court Wednesday, Greaves agreed to plead no contest as charged and will serve two years' probation. While the plea does not require Greaves to register as a sex offender, he is required to continue mental health counseling, said Chip Thullbery, spokesman for the prosecutor's office. ""We believe this agreement accomplishes our objectives: to see he does not do it again and give a warning to others who may want to create such materials,"" Thullbery said. ""If he publishes this book again or sells it further, he would be subject to re-arrest."" If that occurs, Greaves could be sentenced to the maximum for the charge: five years in prison. However, while the probationary terms apply to Florida, Thullbery did not know what action, if any, Florida prosecutors could take if Greaves sells the controversial book in another state where it could be considered legal. ""We'll have to address that issue at that time,"" Thullbery said. Greaves will be allowed to serve the probationary term in Colorado. Judd has previously publicly said his office's investigation into Greaves and his subsequent arrest was prompted by media reports on the book, including one by CNN's ""AC360,"" and the public outcry.","Phillip Greaves was arrested in December .

"(CNN)  -- Imagine a tiny boat afloat on a thrashing sea, water pouring through a gaping hole in the hull. A sailor is frantically bailing dark, angry water, but no matter how much he scoops, the water line never seems to recede -- more waves just pummel him in the face like a particularly insecure middle-school bully. That, my friends, is our metaphor for the average worker's e-mail inbox. Yeah, we know, there are tons of new communication technologies out there, but e-mail still reigns supreme in the worker realm: A recent study even shows that e-mail eats up the most mobile time among Americans. Which is why we think it's high time to outline some of the most annoying practices when it comes to business e-mails -- practices that might make your compatriots drown themselves in frustration. Read on to avoid making these 10 mistakes: . 1) ""YELLING"" Ever get an e-mail like this? Subject line: MY CLIENT URGENTLY NEEDS TO SPEAK WITH YOU! Hot tip: When you type in all caps, you're basically likening yourself to those crazy dudes who yell about the End Times on the subway (who are perhaps a bit subdued at present). Yeah, no one wants to talk to you. 2) Going all kindergarten with your fonts . Remember when LeBron James spurned the Cleveland Cavaliers and joined forces with the Miami Heat, prompting Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert to pen a long letter on the team website tearing into James? Remember what font Gilbert used? That's right, Comic Sans -- aka ""The Great Underminer."" Stick to Helvetica, folks, and people will remember your sentiment instead of your poor choice of typeface. (To say nothing of pink fonts and Word Art-like signatures splashed across floral graphics.) 3) Misnomers . Unless you are supremely stupid, senile or illiterate, there is no real excuse for getting a business contact's name wrong, because it's right there in his/her e-mail address. Consider this cautionary tale. If you're prone to typos, well, then, that's what copy-paste is for. 4) Emoticons . As we have stated in the past -- back when we called for a brief break from the smiley -- emoticons have reached ""STD-like proportions since their inception, spreading from one person to another like particularly expressive herpes."" OK, we can see the necessity of using a placating ""smiley"" in an e-mail to a contact who might need a spoonful of sugar to make the ""your idea sucks"" medicine go down. But nix emoticons from any initial e-mails with new contacts. 5) Overly informal greetings . ""Helloz Sar-Sar! Imma tell you about a super rad product that, let's face it, all of us gurlz should totally peep if you have a burnin' hot love life but want to avoid burnin' hot other things (you know what I'm talkin' about!)."" No one has a strong enough stomach to deal with epistles of this sort on a daily basis. Save the LOLCat speech for when you're old and gray and shooting off adorable, kitten-packed e-mails to your grumbling grandkids. They can't fire you for being obnoxious. 6) Rambling . Allow me to narrate the internal dialogue of the average desk-bound minion: ""Spreadsheets sure have a lot of lines... I'm hungry... I hope no one notices this hickey that Joe from accounting gave me after Happy Hour last night.... I'm hungry... Look! There's a blue bird outside and it cocked its head at me!"" Get to the point. You have approximately three sentences to cut through said desk worker's mental clutter before she -- Oh, someone sent me a video of a dog hugging a turtle! 7) Unclear subject lines . Do you have important news? Then, by all means, say so in your subject line. Hiding a vital correspondence behind a ""Subject Line: Hey"" is not doing anyone any favors -- except for your competition. 8) Sending too many e-mails in a row . You probably spend, oh, 20 hours per day glued to some form of computer-esque device (soon the machines will destroy us all), which means that when you don't receive an immediate response to your e-mail, it's possible to, well overreact -- much like a clingy lover waiting for an answer on that ""Dinner tonight, then a different kind of spooning?"" text. Don't be a desperate loser. Wait at least 24 hours before sending a follow-up e-mail, unless it's an emergency, in which case there's this handy thing called the phone or, you know, the five-second walk over to your co-worker's desk. Yeah, we know, real life communications are hard. 9) Clip art . I imagine most of you are intelligent enough to figure out why this is not OK. 10) Not using the right method of contact . Never message a business contact on Facebook. Seriously. Why? Because Facebook is where you go to look at pictures of people from high school when you're drunk -- there's even a plug-in to prevent you from ruining your social media life whilst whiskey-soaked. Sending a business-oriented message via Facebook is like wandering into a debauched party and expecting everyone to listen to you when you start talking about sales figures. If you're having issues finding someone's professional contact info, sure, send him/her a message on Facebook or Twitter asking them for that info, but don't carry on a whole convo right then and there. Unless you're looking for dirt on said contact, in which case be sure to send the ol' message at around 4 a.m., when his defenses are down.","Stick to Helvetica and people will remember your sentiment instead of your typeface .
Don't ramble -- you have about three sentences to get a co-worker's attention .
Do you have important news? Then say so in your subject line .
Don't conduct business over Facebook, which is for play time ."
"(CNN) -- A mortar landed near the Russian Embassy in the Syrian capital of Damascus on Thursday, killing a Syrian civilian and injuring nine Syrian security personnel who work for the diplomatic post, Russia's foreign ministry said. No Russians were hurt in the attack, according to the ministry, which said it was trying to determine who launched the shell. The United States condemned the shelling. ""The United States continues to emphasize that those responsible for atrocities on all sides must be held accountable,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement. The death was one of dozens reported Thursday throughout Syria, plagued by civil war. State-run media reported that the regime's army recaptured the city of Deir Attiya from opposition militants on Thursday. The army killed an unspecified number of militants who earlier this month had taken the city, about 50 miles northeast of Damascus, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. The opposition group Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported at least 55 people were killed Thursday, including 20 in Damascus and its suburbs and 10 in Raqqa. Raqqa, in northern Syria, is where a regime-fired Scud missile hit a market a day earlier, killing about 35 people and wounding dozens of others, according to the main opposition umbrella group, the Syrian National Coalition. The Syrian conflict began in March 2011 after government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring movement. It is now a full-blown civil war. The United Nations estimates that more than 100,000 people have died in the conflict, and 9 million have been displaced. Syria plans to send a delegation to Switzerland early next year to participate in peace talks, but the opposition Free Syrian Army says it will pass. The United Nations announced that the often-delayed Geneva II conference aimed at ending the Syrian civil war starts January 22 in Geneva. Geneva II is a successor to Geneva I, a June 2012 meeting in which international parties laid out a peace plan for Syria that calls for a transitional governing body. It left open the question of whether President Bashar al-Assad must leave power. The United States and Russia announced in May that they would try to bring the warring parties to a second conference in Geneva to implement the plan. But the second Geneva conference has been delayed several times.","NEW: U.S. condemns attack .

"(CNN) -- A Yemeni government aircraft mistakenly bombed its own troops, killing 29 soldiers, a security official told CNN on Sunday. The incident occurred Saturday night in southern Abyan province, where Yemeni forces have been battling Islamic militants, said the Yemeni security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""The attack was an accident, and many lives were lost,"" said the official, who was not authorized to speak to the media. State-run Saba News Agency denies an attack took place against soldiers in Abyan. The soldiers were using a school on the outskirts of Zinjibar, the capital of the Abyan province, as a launching pad to strike at militants in the area when they were bombed, the official said. Militants have been fighting government forces since May, when they announced the province was an Islamic emirate.","Official: ""The attack was an accident and many lives were lost""

"London (CNN) -- As western countries remain mired in financial turmoil, business people are looking to get a foothold in China, hoping to tap its growth and expanding middle class. Solid economic expansion, coupled with a rapid market transformation and a series of government reforms, mean China -- the world's second-largest economy -- is no longer just a country for low-cost manufacturing. It is also an increasingly attractive destination to do business. Several western companies -- including global giants such as Starbucks, Volkswagen, Boeing and Procter & Gamble -- have established a presence in the country. But despite China's increasing influence, challenges remain for those looking to do business in the country. Intense competition, corruption, business etiquette and language are some of the barriers that can be faced. Here are five things you should know before doing business in China. A mosaic of markets . China is the world's most populous nation, with its sprawling 1.3 billion people making up a highly diverse market. ""There is no such thing as the Chinese market,"" says Martin Roll, a business and brand strategist who provides advisory to global and Asian brands on China. ""You have to look at China more like a mosaic of cultures,"" he adds. There is no single consumer profile, and analysts suggest companies remain flexible and innovative, while understanding how their company would fit in each specific market. ""You need people who've been in the market, you talk to trade associations, you talk to trade promotion bodies, you talk to people and bit by bit you get to understand the dynamics,"" says Stephen Perry, president of the 48 Group Club, an independent business network promoting business relations between China and the UK. ""There's no simple answer in China -- it depends so much upon the specific market and upon the specific characteristic of your own company,"" he adds. Business culture and etiquette . Operating in a country with a history of thousands of years -- and ways of doing business that go back as far -- it is valuable to develop insight into China's business culture and social etiquette to avoid misunderstandings that could scuttle deals and harm working relationships. One key aspect of Chinese culture is the concept of ""face."" In ""China Uncovered: What you need to know to do business in China,"" professor Jonathan Story describes face as a mix of public perception, social role and self-esteem than has the potential to either destroy or help build relationships. Story says that a foreign CEO can give face by attending meetings, accepting invitations, providing suitable expensive gifts and showing sensitivity to Chinese culture. In contrast, entrepreneurs can lose face by insulting someone in public, refusing invitations and gifts or by behaving inappropriately, like losing their temper or crying -- acts that are seen as lack of self-control and weakness. Business outsiders can impress with their knowledge of local customs, acknowledging hierarchy, offering gifts, addressing people by their designation -- especially when dealing with state representatives -- and appreciating the food. Such awareness of cultural nuances illustrate respect and sincere interest, says Roll. On the flip side, Chinese business people generally respect cultural differences and won't expect westerners to be fully customized to their tradition, analysts say. ""At the end of the day, the Chinese are very pragmatic,"" says Perry. ""If you have something they want, they'll do business with you no matter whether you can hold chopsticks or not."" Jack Perkowski, a Wall Street veteran who's often referred to as ""Mr China"" for his entrepreneurship in the Asian country since 1993, says developing mutual trust is key to success in doing business in China. ""The most important thing is, whoever you're meeting with or whoever you're dealing with, to treat them with respect,"" he says. Taking a market-based approach . Western businesses looking to tap the Chinese market should be aware of local preferences, and adapt accordingly. For example, Starbucks started serving green tea lattes in a bid to get a traditionally tea-drinking nation hooked on coffee; McDonald's adapted its menu to include items like spicy chicken wings and chicken burgers in an effort to appeal to local tastes. ""No matter how good you think your product is, no matter how well it sells in the UK, the United States or anywhere else, you need to really look at that product in the context of China and say is that the right product, is it too high-priced, do we need to do something different, do we need to adapt?"" says Perkowski. Procedures in China take time, patience and money . Western companies looking to tap China also need to show a long-term approach that will prove that they're in the country to stay, analysts say. ""It's very important when a western company tries to go to China they have to realize that success in China takes time, it requires patience and it costs a lot of resources,"" says Roll. Perry says that people have got to be very open-minded about anticipating what China is going to be in the coming decades. ""(China) is growing in the field of consumer goods and it will grow fast so people have got to find a way to match the future impact of China with the current characteristics of China,"" he says. Build a strong local team . Newcomers wanting to crack China will need to move, get someone from their organization to relocate or find an experienced group to represent them, says Perkowski, who's also the author of ""Managing the Dragon: How I'm Building a Billion Dollar Business in China."" ""When you're just starting, you've got to recognize there's going to be a limit to what you can do travelling back and forth to China,"" he adds. ""You'll never going to get a deal done [without basing yourself there]."" Surrounding yourself with local talent can help you break deals, understand the culture and the complexities of the market as well as compensate for the language barrier for those who don't speak Mandarin, analysts say. ""The only way you are going to ultimately be successful is by putting together a good team,"" says Perkowski.","China is home to a growing middle class with a big appetite for consumer goods .
Western firms looking to tap China should be innovative and flexible, analysts say .
They also need to adopt a long-term approach and build a strong local team .
Competition, corruption, business etiquette and language are some of the hurdles ."
"(CNN) -- The government shutdown is in its second week, and the public debate in the United States is centered around how the crisis will be resolved and who is to blame. What do the polls say? What are the implications for the Republican Party, for House Speaker John Boehner and President Barack Obama? Not many are talking about the international implications. But they could be significant. Many in the international community have argued the U.S. government is dysfunctional or even broken. Friends are questioning whether America can be relied on or whether partisan politics will prevent it from acting when called upon. And with this comes some fear. America's adversaries may come to believe that they can act without consequence -- that America will, in the end, trip over itself. These perceptions are extremely dangerous, both for the United States and the rest of the world. They will limit American deterrence and weaken America's partnerships as friends and allies start to wonder whether the United States has their back. America has long been critiqued internationally both for doing too much and too little. In a study Chatham House is conducting on elite perceptions of the United States, many in Europe cast aspersions on the United States for its actions in Iraq and Afghanistan (wars into which the U.S. pulled others) or its use of drones. They also condemn America's perceived lack of leadership in Syria. They want Washington to act but cannot agree how. It is a no-win situation for America. One thing they are clear on: Europeans (and others, particularly in Asia) want a strong United States. One that provides moral leadership and enforces global norms. One that can be called upon to act, particularly in tough situations. Instead, events in recent weeks have only reinforced the international perception that America is in decline. The ""declinist"" debate has been raging for years, driven in large part by America's diminishing percentage of global gross domestic product (as against China's rise in particular). However, with the recent economic recovery, such views were wavering, and the strength of U.S. innovation, entrepreneurship and technology, coming on top of the energy revolution, were persuading some that the United States was once again on the rise. In recent weeks however, these arguments have been overcome by the pictures of gridlock and weakness in Washington. First it was the story that Obama was ""saved"" by Russian President Vladimir Putin from an embarrassing loss in a congressional vote to attack Syria over its suspected use of chemical weapons. Then came the shutdown. And, for those in the private sector in particular, a developing fear that, come October 17, when the United States needs to raise its debt ceiling, it will instead drive itself and the world's economy off a cliff. The idea of America as a secure, stable, predictable state, where investment cannot fail to be reimbursed, would suffer a significant blow. Holders of Treasury bonds would no longer be assured of their returns. Chinese efforts to weaken the position of the dollar as the only reserve currency would get a boost. Investors would no longer have the gold-standard U.S. guarantee. But while perceptions are extremely important, they are not reality. As Sunday's anti-terrorist operations in Somalia and Libya show, America will act when it wants to. While the U.S. Treasury bond may seem less secure, it is still far stronger and better guaranteed than that of any other large economy. A nation moves when its interests, capabilities and will are engaged. America's interests have not changed. Its capabilities are still vastly superior to those of most other nations. The only question is America's will. Many internationally will continue to question U.S. power and influence. Its adversaries will surely continue to test these. America's allies and friends will be made nervous over its perceived decline. But while the Washington gridlock and partisan politics make action tougher and more costly -- make it harder for America to rally friends and share burdens, and to deter and dissuade opponents -- it would nevertheless be dangerous to underestimate the United States. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Xenia Dormandy.","Xenia Dormandy: Shutdown, default threat have global implications and world is worried .
She says perception that America is broken makes allies doubt support, hurts deterrence .

"(CNN) -- A second lawsuit has been filed accusing Kevin Clash, the puppeteer who provided the voice of Elmo on ""Sesame Street,"" of engaging in a sexual relationship with a minor. In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in New York, a Florida man referred to as John Doe says Clash lured him into a sexual relationship in 2000, when the then-16-year-old came to the New York area from Florida to pursue modeling opportunities. Clash's lawyer said the federal cases against his client are without merit. ""The cases and Mr. Clash's reputation will be defended vigorously,"" attorney Michael Berger said in a written statement. Clash made contact with the teen through a gay chat line, posing as a 30-year-old named Craig, the second lawsuit alleges. After a couple of phone conversations, Clash invited the teen, who had been staying with relatives in New Jersey during his modeling visit, to spend time with Clash at his Manhattan apartment. It was there that the sexual contact occurred after Clash supplied the boy with alcohol, the lawsuit says. Clash kept in contact with the teen until the boy graduated from high school, turned 18 and moved to New York City to pursue his modeling career, the suit says. The pair had a sexual relationship at that time, the suit says. The suit alleges that the plaintiff suffered psychological and emotional injuries from his sexual relationship with Clash as a teenager and asks for damages from Clash. The plaintiff is asking for a jury trial. It's the second lawsuit to be filed against Clash this month. In a suit filed November 20, Cecil Singleton alleges that Clash ""persuaded, induced, coerced or enticed"" him to meet for sexual encounters when he was 15 years old. That suit seeks $5 million in damages from Clash, alleging that Singleton ""suffered severe injuries, including but not limited to mental, psychological and emotional trauma."" Singleton has said the case is not about the money. ""In fact, I'd like to make him (Clash) an offer. If he would acknowledge the relationship we had when I was 15 years old, as well as apologize to any prospective victim out there, and agree to never work around minors, as well as pay my attorneys' fees, I drop the $5 million lawsuit,"" Singleton told HLN's Dr. Drew Pinsky. Singleton and the latest plaintiff are being represented by attorney Jeff Herman, whose practice is limited to sexual abuse cases. Speaking to CNN, Herman said the latest plaintiff ""felt he had a duty to come forward"" to ""shed a light on the truth."" Clash, 52, resigned from his job on ""Sesame Street"" after the first lawsuit was filed. ""I am resigning from Sesame Workshop with a very heavy heart,"" Clash said in a written statement at the time. ""I have loved every day of my 28 years working for this exceptional organization. Personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work Sesame Street is doing and I cannot allow it to go on any longer. I am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately."" Despite his stepping down, Clash's voice will be used for Elmo through 2014, as the next season of ""Sesame Street"" has already been filmed. Season 44 will begin airing September 2013 and air for the year, according to a show representative. Earlier in November, another man who had accused Clash of engaging in a sexual relationship with him as a teenager recanted that claim, issuing a statement saying that it was ""an adult consensual relationship."" When the first accusation emerged, Clash acknowledged a relationship between ""two consenting adults"" but said the man otherwise was making a ""false and defamatory allegation."" ""I am a gay man,"" Clash said in a statement. ""I have never been ashamed of this or tried to hide it, but felt it was a personal and private matter."" Clash was the high-pitched voice of the iconic furry red Elmo, whom he played since 1984, winning Emmy Awards along the way. He was the third Muppeteer to take on the role.

"(CNN) -- The wait is over for Caroline Wozniacki. The Dane has collected her first title of 2013 in Luxembourg. The 23-year-old eased to a 6-2 6-2 win over German Annika Beck to notch up her 21st career win. Her boyfriend Rory McIlroy, who had finished his day joint second at golf's Korea Open, posted his congratulations on Twitter. But in Luxembourg, Wozniacki had a special thank you reserved for her four legged friend. ""Thank you to all the fans who came out all week,"" the world No. 9 said. ""This is a great event - we all love playing here. ""I also want to thank my dad, and my mom who's back at the hotel with little Bruno, who's my dog!"" Wozniacki now heads to the season ending championship in Istanbul as the first reserve. She and American Sloane Stephens, who is the second alternate, can expect to be called up if any of the eight qualified players pull out of the tournament. For now, the former world No. 1 was pleased to notch up her first win in a season where she has struggled to find consistent form. ""Twenty-first title, it's great,"" Wozniacki added. ""I'm still young - I have a few more years to go - so to be at 21 already is just great. This is what you practice for, so to win is an amazing feeling."" Debut win for Dimitrov . There was a breakthrough win for Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov at the Stockholm Open. The 22-year-old, who dates four time grand slam winner Maria Sharapova, came back from one set down to stun world No.3 David Ferrer and wrap up a 2-6 6-3 6-4 win. ""It's one of my biggest wins,"" said Dimitrov as he celebrated his first ATP World Tour title. ""To beat a top guy in a final, it's a great feeling and it's good for your mental state. ""You know you can hang with these guys and the next time you play against them, especially in the grand slams, you will be better prepared."" The Stockholm title also earned Dimitrov $131,000 and saw him rise to a career high ranking of 22. Race to London . In Austria, Tommy Haas saw off his namesake Robin Haase 6-3 4-6 6-4 to lift the Erste Bank Open trophy. It was the 35-year-old German's 15th career and comes 12 years after he won his first title in Vienna. Haas, the world No.12, has a very slim chance of reaching next month's season-ending finale in London. Only the top eight singles players will compete for the World Tour title, although with Andy Murray out of the running because of back surgery there is an extra place up for grabs. Richard Gasquet put himself in the hot seat as victory in Moscow moved the Frenchman to No.9 in the race to London. Gasquet defeated Kazakhstan's Mikhail Kukushkin 4-6 6-4 6-4 in the Kremlin Cup final. ""I'll try my best to qualify,"" said Gasquet, who has not played in the season finale since 2007. ""Two big tournaments are coming up. I'll try my best. I was close to losing today. But I fought a lot. ""It's important for me to qualify but the title here is important for me because my opponent played very well.""","Caroline Wozniacki wins her first title of the year at the Luxembourg Open .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Sonny Bill Williams, the code-hopping rugby player who is perhaps the most talked-about athlete in Australasian sport, will make himself available to the New Zealand rugby league team in an attempt to win World Cups in two sports, says his manager. Williams' manager, Khoder Nasser, told CNN of his client's decision Tuesday, hours after New Zealand selectors named a squad without the 28-year-old star to contest the Rugby League World Cup, which will be held in England and Wales in October and November. Speculation about whether Williams would play in the World Cup has been a hot topic in rugby union and league since he helped propel his Sydney Roosters club to victory in Australia's National Rugby League grand final Sunday, amid talk it would be his last game in the sport. Williams has been tipped to return to the 15-a-side game of rugby union in 2014 to play for New Zealand's All Blacks, with whom he won the sport's World Cup in 2011. Williams was initially not named in the New Zealand rugby league World Cup squad, having told selectors he was unavailable, but Nasser told CNN that the lure of lifting a World Cup in another sport had prompted a change of heart. ""He's in a position where he could win two World Cups in two different sports,"" said Nasser. ""He doesn't want to regret anything. He's a softie. (It's) a hard sport, but he's a softie."" As for the timing of the decision, coming after the 24-man squad had been named? ""We're very spontaneous,"" he said. Since controversially leaving the 13-man game of rugby league for rugby union in 2008, walking out on his club mid-season, Williams has proved himself one of world sport's most versatile athletes -- and one of the most talked about public figures in Australia and New Zealand. After a stint learning the game of rugby union in France, he returned to New Zealand with the stated ambition of making the All Blacks and winning the World Cup. He did so in 2011, winning the Super Rugby international club championship with New Zealand-based franchise the Chiefs the following year. He then declared he wanted to return to the Australian rugby league competition where he had initially made his name. Williams has also expanded his repertoire to boxing, winning six heavily publicized bouts to become New Zealand's reigning heavyweight champion. Now that he has achieved his goal of winning Australian club rugby league's top prize -- for the second time, having been part of a victorious Bulldogs team in his debut season -- questions are being asked as to whether he will return to the All Blacks next year or remain in rugby league. Nasser would only say to expect to see him at the rugby league World Cup -- where he is expected to be one of the tournament's main drawcards -- and that another professional boxing bout was planned for the off-season. The New Zealand Rugby League did not respond to a request for comment.

"London (CNN) -- Royal watchers eagerly await the arrival of a child that will be heir to the British throne. Here's what you need to know and the latest developments: . • Queen Elizabeth II is among those keen for the new baby to greet the world. On a visit to northern England Wednesday, she was asked by a little girl whether she wants her great-grandchild to be a boy or a girl. The queen replied: ""I don't think I mind. I would very much like it to arrive. I'm going on holiday."" • The Duchess of Cambridge is now overdue. A royal source tells CNN that her due date was July 13. She and Prince William announced at the start of the year that the baby was due in July, but did not announce the date. • Prince Charles' wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, said Monday that the family was on tenterhooks for the baby's arrival -- and suggested it could be very soon. ""We're all waiting at the end of a telephone,"" she said, in an exchange filmed by ITV. ""I hope by the end of the week, he or she will be there."" • The baby will have the title His or Her Royal Highness Prince or Princess (the baby's name) of Cambridge, St. James's Palace said this month. However, it could be as long as 10 days before the baby's name is announced. • Speculation on what that name will be is rife -- and betting is going strong. Bookies' favorites include Alexandra, Elizabeth or Charlotte for a girl, and George or James for a boy. • Anyone born in Britain on the same day as William and Catherine's baby will receive a special coin from the Royal Mint: a silver penny, dated 2013, that will come in a blue pouch for a boy or a pink one for a girl. • Catherine is expected to give birth at the private Lindo wing of St. Mary's Hospital, next to Paddington Station in London. It's where William was born. Catherine's mother, Carole Middleton, is likely to be on hand at the hospital. • The first indication that the baby is on its way will be an announcement in the media that the duchess has been admitted to the hospital in the early stages of labor, royal sources tell CNN. The next public announcement is expected to be that of the birth. It will be made in the form of a formal bulletin, signed by medical staff and rushed in a car with a police escort to Buckingham Palace. There, the notice will be placed in a gilt frame positioned on an easel -- the same one used to announce William's birth -- and placed in the palace forecourt for all to see. • The first to know about the royal baby will be Queen Elizabeth II, Prime Minister David Cameron and the governors general of each of the commonwealth nations, along with the rest of the royal and Middleton families. If the baby arrives in the middle of the night, it's unlikely the queen will be awoken, so there is a chance in that instance that an official announcement will not be made until the following morning. • Celebratory gun salutes will be sounded by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery in Green Park (41 rounds) and the Honorable Artillery Company at the Tower of London (62 rounds) after the baby is born. • William and Catherine did not want to know the sex of their baby beforehand, royal sources say. There has been speculation it is a girl, however, especially after a member of the public said in March that the duchess almost uttered ""daughter"" while at a public event in Grimsby. The woman said the duchess was given a teddy bear and replied, ""Thank you, I will take that for my d--"" but then stopped herself. • The baby will be third in line to the throne after Prince Charles and Prince William, regardless of gender. A rule change in 2011 ended centuries of male primogeniture, which decreed that the crown passed to the eldest son and was bestowed on a daughter only when there were no sons. It means that if the next royal baby is a girl, she will eventually become queen; previously, a younger male sibling would have taken precedence. • The queen's cousin, Margaret Rhodes, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour she hoped the child would have a normal childhood. ""I imagine and hope that its early life, until it's at least in its teens, will be just a jolly, happy, ordinary child's life,"" she said. • It's not known where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge plan to spend the days and weeks following the birth. William is expected to be given the usual paternity leave of two weeks by the Ministry of Defence, royal sources say. He will then return to his job as a helicopter search and rescue pilot. • The revelation that Catherine was pregnant came after she was admitted to a London hospital in December for acute morning sickness.","NEW: The queen doesn't mind if the baby's a boy or a girl -- she just wants it to arrive soon .

"(CNN) -- A Beijing man who snatched a baby from a pram and hurled it to its death in an argument over a parking space was Wednesday sentenced to death by a Beijing court, according to court documents. Han Lei, 39, was charged with intentional homicide over the death of the two-year-old girl who died in hospital from brain damage 50 hours after being dashed to the pavement in the Daxing District of Beijing on July 23. The court sentenced his friend Li Ming, who helped Han escape after the incident, to five years' jail. The Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court heard how Han and Li decided to drive to a karaoke bar after a dinner with several other people. Unable to find a parking space, they attempted to park at a bus stop where a woman, also surnamed Li, was waiting with the 2-year, 10-month-old baby who was named as Sun in court documents. An altercation began when Han accused the mother of blocking the car's path with the pushchair. The court heard how Han hit the mother and then proceeded to hurl the baby out of its pram. The court rejected his defense that he had been intoxicated at the time of the attack, saying that his mental condition had been ""stable"" despite earlier drinking at dinner. Prosecutors recommended that Han, who committed the crime within a year of being released from prison, be given the death sentence. ""I smacked her in the face. She hit back, too. People started to gather around us. I just wanted to smash the trolley,"" Han reportedly said in a statement to police. The girl's mother told police that Han had earlier threatened to kill the child and had acted before she was able to take measures to protect her. Han fled the scene with Li Ming, who was charged with harboring a criminal, but was arrested by police the next day. Li turned himself in to police on July 25. Relatives of the child asked for a total of 2.73 million yuan ($443,513) in civil compensation during the court hearing, according to state-run Xinhua. The case drew a strong response on Chinese social media site Weibo where posters mostly applauded the death sentence: ""He deserves to be shot 100 times,"" said poster Xiongwoxi while another, named as Wujiayounvchuzhangcheng, said the death sentence was not strong enough. ""Dying once is leniency,"" he said. Despite this, there were some calls to end capital punishment in China. ""Although he deserves the death, shouldn't we give him another chance? Do we must have people die one after another?"" said poster Linxidaxuesonglianli.","Beijing man sentenced to death after hurling a baby from its pram .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkish authorities have brought the chief suspect in the murder of an American woman slain in Turkey to Istanbul after he was apprehended at a border crossing between Turkey and Syria on Sunday. The man suspected of killing Sarai Sierra, an American tourist who went missing on January 22, was caught in the border province of Hatay, according to a statement by the Hatay governorate. The suspect, called ""Z.T."" and also known as ""Laz Ziya,"" was caught ""in the Reyhanli District of our province by security forces,"" the statement said. Sierra, a mother and amateur photographer from Staten Island, New York, was found slain by a blow to the head on February 2 near the old city walls of Istanbul. After an investigation involving the interrogation of more than 20 suspects and the collection of blood samples from last known contacts, police identified Ziya as the primary suspect in the slaying. Turkish television showed video of police marching Ziya to an armored personnel carrier. After he was apprehended in Hatay, he was flown to Istanbul for processing late Sunday. In a strange twist to a mystery that has been front-page news for weeks in Turkey, it appears the suspect fled to neighboring Syria in an attempt to escape Turkish authorities. A purported videotaped confession made by the suspect before he was handed over to Turkish authorities has been distributed by the Turkish Internet news portal TimeTurk. In the statement, Ziya tells the camera he is speaking in Syria. The editor of TimeTurk says the video was taken near the Syrian city of Idlib 30 minutes before Ziya was handed over to Turkish authorities. It is not clear whether the confession can be legally admitted as evidence in court, because it is possible the suspect made the video under pressure or threats from his captors in Syria. ""I lost myself. I can't really remember how it happened,"" Ziya said in the video. ""I must have hit her on the head with a heavy object,"" he said, adding that he was under the influence of an ""extreme amount"" of paint thinner. ""When I came to, she was dead. I covered her up,"" he said. ""And for nine days, I walked around in the same area. When on the 10th day the police found the body, I had to escape to Syria. And now I have been caught in Syria. And I am being handed back to Turkey today,"" Ziya added. In the video, the suspect said he first fled to Karabuk, his hometown in the Black Sea region of Turkey, then to the border and into Syria. This is not the first time suspects wanted in Turkey have been handed over. Last week, Syria handed over at least five suspects in a deadly car bombing of a busy Turkey-Syria border gate. The February bombing killed at least 14 people and wounded nearly 30. Turkey has close ties with Syrian rebel groups that control large amounts of territory in northern Syria. Turkey has provided medical care for wounded Syrian fighters, while also hosting more than 100,000 Syrian refugees in refugee camps. This week, Syrian opposition groups are gathering in the commercial capital of Istanbul to choose the leader of a proposed interim government. The delivery of suspects in Syria wanted by Turkish authorities twice in less than two weeks suggests armed groups inside Syria are cooperating closely with Turkish security forces.","He was captured in Turkey's Hatay province and flown to Istanbul, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- Kenya remains a safe place to visit despite an attack on a Nairobi shopping mall over the weekend in which at least 68 people, including foreigners, died, the country's tourism minister said Monday. The siege by suspected Islamist militants at the upscale Westgate Mall represents another potential blow to tourism in Kenya, whose tourist numbers have increased in recent years but which has also suffered a series of violent incidents affecting foreigners. The mall, normally a calm refuge in an often turbulent city, is itself a tourist draw in the Kenyan capital, and suspected Islamist militants may have targeted it partly for that reason. ""It's a really international place,"" Isha Saini, a Nairobi interior designer, told CNN. ""Lots of expats and other foreigners go there on the weekend for lunch. ""This is definitely going to have a big impact on tourism."" Foreigners among dead . Among those killed in the mall siege were three British citizens, two French nationals and two Canadians, their governments said. Several American citizens were among the wounded. The attack is the latest of several incidents in the past few years to have hurt the country's tourism image. In late 2011, a British man, David Tebbutt, was killed and his wife held hostage for 192 days in an attack by Somali pirates on the couple's luxury resort near Kenya's Lamu Island. In October of the same year, an elderly French expatriate was kidnapped from her home on Manda island, in the Lamu archipelago, and died shortly afterwards owing to her fragile health. In March this year, the month of national elections, tourists were warned to stay away from Kenya over fears of a repeat of the violence that followed the country's last such poll, in 2007, when more than 1,200 people died. In the event, the elections passed off peacefully. A few months later, in early August this year, a huge fire destroyed large parts of Nairobi's Kenyatta International Airport, a major African transport hub. ""Despicable act"" In a statement on the Nairobi mall attack -- which latest reports suggest authorities are close to resolving -- Kenya's tourism and commerce secretary, Phyllis Kandie, condemned what she called ""a despicable act of cowardice intended to instill fear among Kenyans and our visitors."" Tourist facilities throughout the country were ""operating normally,"" she said, and the government had ""scaled up security"" in these and other ""social places."" Two tourism conferences -- one on hotel investment and another on eco-tourism -- were due to go ahead in Nairobi this week, Kandie said. She also noted that the British government had not changed its official travel advice on Kenya. At the time of writing, the U.S. state department's advice also remained unchanged. Tourism boost . Kenya has made strides in recent years to boost tourism, one of its major industries and its main source of foreign exchange. The industry had been hit hard in the past by events such as the 1998 bombing of the US embassy in Nairobi and the negative travel advice from foreign governments that followed. Yet from 2008 to 20011 tourist arrivals in Kenya climbed from approximately 1.2 million to 1.8 million, according to Kenyan government figures -- a 50% increase. Tourism revenue doubled over the period from 53 billion Kenyan shillings ($600 million) to 98 billion shillings. Safaris top attraction . For decades, wildlife safaris have been Kenya's top tourism draw. Tsavo National Park is one of Africa's best places to see elephants, lions and leopards, as well as to witness the continent's famed wildebeest migration. Also on CNN: Ten things you probably didn't know you could do in Kenya . Kenya's Indian Ocean beach resorts are another big attraction, as is the dramatic landscape of cliffs and gorges in Hell's Gate National Park. Despite the weekend attack and the city's generally edgy reputation, the cafes and nightlife of Nairobi also offer one of the liveliest slices of urban existence in Africa. Risk of robbery . In general advice, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office warns against the risk of robbery in Nairobi and other large Kenyan cities, although it says foreigners aren't usually targeted. Tourists should nonetheless avoid carrying large amounts of cash and wearing expensive jewelry, the FCO says. The British government additionally advises against all but essential travel to within 60 kilometers of the Kenya-Somali border and to other pockets within Nairobi and Kenya more widely.","Mall attack may have targeted tourists .

"(CNN) -- There was no feeling in Matthias Lanzinger's leg when he regained consciousness in hospital after his skiing accident. As he blinked and opened his eyes, his first question to his wife, who was sitting at his bedside, was whether he would have to spend his life in a wheelchair. ""She said 'no you don't,'"" Lanzinger told CNN. ""'Everything is OK, you can get on with your life but they had to amputate your leg. Our life is going to go on."" He has absolutely no memory of the day five years ago when his life changed forever. On Sunday March 2, 2008 he was competing in a World Cup Super-G race -- in Kvitfjell, Norway -- and crashed into a gate, falling down the mountainside, breaking his leg in the process. ""I just don't remember anything from the accident, it's nothing. I know until the gate and crashing, then nothing. I think it's good for me that way right now."" Lanzinger was once the rising star of Austrian alpine skiing. A junior world champion, he had won the Europa Cup and picked up a podium finish in a World Cup Super-G in 2005. But his horrific accident brutally halted his career's rising trajectory. The resulting damage to his blood circulation in his leg meant the doctors had to amputate below the left knee -- had they not done so, he could have died. ""I know that maybe things could have been done differently,"" Lanzinger says wistfully. ""But what is the point of thinking about it? The fact is I can't change my amputation. When I think about it or I'm angry about it, it doesn't matter as the reality is that would not change a thing. So what's the point? ""The fact is I have an amputation and I look forward not back. I like to live life in a positive way."" Most immediately, he is looking forward to the 2014 Winter Olympics, his skiing career continuing but merely realigned after his life changing accident. Where once he had aspired to compete in both Vancouver and Sochi alongside able bodied athletes, he will instead take part at the Paralympics in the Russian city, and he has modest ambitions. Despite winning gold, silver and bronze at this season's World Championships, he has one, simple target. ""When I get to Sochi, a medal is the goal,"" he says, ""and obviously gold would be nice. But more important than that is the way to Sochi. ""The years have been very tough, so this journey is still the most important. ""For me, the pleasure will just be to start in Sochi. If I could then get a medal -- even maybe a gold -- that would be the dream coming true. That is the reason why I did my comeback."" Lure of the slopes . After the amputation, Lanzinger had opted not to return to the slopes and test his skiing prowess once more. With a new job with the ski manufacturer Salomon, he felt his life had moved on but gradually his view shifted, and the lure of the slopes returned. ""I never wanted to come back to the sport,"" he admits. ""I wanted to do my new life. I studied in business administration and then onto my work as marketing manager for Salomon. ""Everything was fine in my new life, with many other things other than skiing. ""But then I started to think how I would feel in 30 or 40 years if I did not try it competitively again. So I wanted to answer that question."" For his first competitive run, he admitted he was awash with nerves, unsure how well he had adapted in training to skiing on a prosthetic leg and of the different technique required to tackle the gates on the course. ""After that first run, the feeling was back,"" he says. ""It was the feeling of my last race, like it was a few months ago and not three years ago. Since then, I like racing, maybe even more than before the accident because now I do it for fun, the pressure is gone. This is enjoyment."" Lanzinger has not watched his accident back, although he is slowly coming round to the idea that one day he will. ""Maybe in the future I'll watch to find out what happened,"" he says. ""But right now, I don't see any benefits at all. His training for Sochi is currently in full swing and, for now, his stump is in good order, although he has had problems in the past. Severe inflammation in previous seasons meant he had to undergo further surgery -- ""the pressure on the stump when skiing is so much"" -- but he is now on top of the problem, getting the right balance of neither too much nor too little exercise on it. Guiding him to Sochi is his coach Manuel Hujara, who has worked with Lanzinger since his decision to return to competitive skiing. Hujara says he has not had to work on his pupil's mental demons returning to a sport that cost him a leg. ""To be able to come to the team, you have to be able to have worked through that first,"" says Hujara. ""Matthias has done that. If not, you can't do the sport at the highest level."" He has a chance to medal in every discipline. He's a special guy, with coming back from that bad World Cup accident."" Both Hujara and Lanzinger are pushing to improve the backing and profile for disabled skiing in Austria. Hujara describes it as ""really bad"" while Lanzinger says ""things are getting better"" but that it is a painfully slow process. Should Lanzinger, named Austria's disabled athlete of the year in 2012, win gold in Sochi, that will only help the cause. As for what is in store for him after his Russian adventure, he genuinely has no idea. ""I've not thought about it,"" he says of life after Sochi. ""Let's see what I do there first."" A gold around his neck would surely be the perfect outcome to an often long and tortuous journey.","Matthias Lanzinger underwent leg amputation after crashing heavily on the World Cup circuit .

"(CNN) -- A friend said Monday that ""something happened"" to the man police accused of killing four homeless people in California, after he came back from serving in the U.S. military in Iraq. ""He was a little bit more serious, it seemed like there was something on his mind,"" Brian, who lived a few doors down from Itzcoatl Ocampo and asked to be identified only by his first name, told CNN. ""He seemed really depressed and down, and things in his life weren't looking that well."" The 23-year-old Ocampo was arrested Friday night after he allegedly stabbed a transient to death in Orange County, Anaheim Police Sgt. Bob Dunn said Sunday. The suspect has not been arraigned in relation to that or the three other killings, and police have not detailed evidence behind their accusation. His father, Refugio Ocampo, who lost his home in 2008 and now lives in the cab of a semi-trailer parked in Fullerton, California, said it was hard to believe his son could be involved in the killings. ""I saw him so many times giving the last money he had in his pocket ... to the homeless, to the people that (are) asking for some help. ... My son's always been a role model,"" Ocampo said in a video interview posted on the Orange County Register's website. Ocampo, 50, told the Register that his son, worried about his father's safety, had recently pointed out an FBI warning about homeless men being killed in the area. Refugio Ocampo said his son was a Marine in Iraq, and returned a changed man. He started talking about things that ""didn't make any sense,"" like the end of the world. U.S. military officials didn't immediately respond Monday to CNN requests for information about Itzcoatl Ocampo's military service. ""They killed the person he was,"" he told the Orange County Register. ""And that's the only possibility I can think of that he would do something like that."" Brian, the neighbor, described Itzcoatl Ocampo as a ""fun, ... ordinary kid"" when they grew up together in southern California, adding ""he was really looking forward to the service"" after graduating from high school. ""When you were around him, you had fun,"" the suspect's high school classmate said. But like Ocampo's father, Brian said he noticed some recent changes in the young man, including when the two met up a few times last summer. ""I knew he wanted to see (combat) action, and I knew he enjoyed it,"" said Brian, noting he'd lent his friend a self-help book. ""Then something happened, and I just don't know what."" Brian added that he had a hard time reckoning that his friend possibly could be responsible for the killings. ""I would never have guessed this,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Ukrainians angry at their government's last-minute decision to suspend talks with the EU clashed for a second day with police in the capital Kiev on Monday. A day earlier, tens of thousands of protesters tried to break through a cordon around government buildings. On both occasions, police responded with batons and tear gas to disperse them. At the heart of the protests is Ukraine's about-turn after a year of insisting that it was intent on signing a historic political and trade agreement with the European Union, . On Thursday, however, the government decided to suspend talks with the EU. Ukraine's president, Viktor Yanukovych, is in a tight spot. Under severe economic pressure from Ukraine's giant neighbor, Russia, not to join the EU, he also was facing a key EU demand that he was unwilling to meet: free former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, his bitter political opponent. Two years ago, she was found guilty of abuse of office in a Russian gas deal and sentenced to seven years in prison in a case widely seen as politically motivated. Her supporters say she needs to travel abroad for medical treatment. ""Yanukovych has decided it's more important to keep Tymoshenko in prison than to integrate Ukraine closer toward Europe,"" said David Kramer of Freedom House, a U.S.-based nongovernmental organization. ""He has left his country vulnerable to Vladimir Putin's threats and pressure. That will be Yanukovych's legacy if he doesn't reverse course."" The deal, the EU's ""Eastern Partnership,"" was aimed at creating closer political and economic ties and fostering economic growth among the nations of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, including Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Belarus. The agreement was expected to be signed this week at a summit in in Vilnius, Lithuania. CNN's Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","Police respond with batons and tear gas .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama has done the right thing by asking Congress to authorize the use of force against Syria to punish President Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons on his own people. I say that even as someone who has been a sharp critic of the administration's Syria policy and an outspoken advocate of intervening in various ways to try to protect the millions of innocent Syrians whose lives are at risk, prevent the conflict from destabilizing the region and support members of the Syrian opposition who share our values. The president, as he announced in May, is trying to steer this nation back to a world in which we are not permanently at war and we do not turn to our military as the weapon of first resort in any international crisis. The Framers of our Constitution wanted to ensure that the decision to send our young men and women into battle could not be taken lightly. Both Democratic and Republican presidents have steadily chafed at those restraints over the course of the decades since World War II as traditional wars and formal declarations of war have faded away. George W. Bush's proclamation of a ""war on terror,"" authorized by Congress, put this nation in a state of permanent emergency in which the commander in chief has had extraordinary powers. Opinion: GOP shouldn't bail out Obama's floundering foreign policy . That is unhealthy and dangerous for a democracy. A former constitutional law professor, Obama understands that although he has a limited reserve of power that could allow him to act alone, his power will be far greater with Congress. The constitutional framework is designed be a check in the best sense -- to require our leaders to make their case to the American people, to act on the basis of reasoned arguments about the nature of American interests that will stand up far beyond the White House Situation Room. And the American people should back him on this decision, for three reasons. First, we are protecting ourselves and our allies. We cannot afford to live in a world in which nations can use chemical weapons with impunity. The taboo against chemical weapons is particularly strong, for good reason. Dying by the breath we need to live holds a particular terror. The parents of the children whose shrouds we see could not protect them even with their own bodies, like human shields from a bullet or a bomb. The United States stood by when Iraq used chemical weapons first against Iran and later against its own people, to our shame. But we must not make that mistake again. Chemical weapons are the weapons of the weak against the strong, which is why al-Assad, has been driven to use them repeatedly, according to U.S. intelligence, when his back is against the wall, as it is now in Damascus. Should chemical weapons proliferate, they will be the weapons of choice for terrorists. Opinion: Obama, ignore the polls on Syria . Second, striking Syria now will be a strike to protect the Syrian people, even if partial and belated. It will not end the massacres carried out with conventional weapons. But weapons of mass destruction are just that: weapons of mass destruction. A chemical attack that kills 1,000 today can kill 10,000 tomorrow and 100,000 the day after that. Third, the president is asking us to do, as a nation, what a leader has to do. In his 2008 inaugural address, Obama called for a new era of responsibility in this country, ""a recognition ... that we have duties to ourselves, our nation and the world."" We have those duties not because the United States has some unique role or mission in the world, but because we are the world's most powerful nation. Other nations take their cues from our action or inaction, whether we want them to or not. If we do not act, we are signaling that the world has suddenly become a far more permissive and dangerous place, that taboos can be broken, and that despite the pious words of the international community, leaders can do whatever they like within their own borders. If we lead, other nations that take their responsibilities seriously as great powers will join us. A Russian veto may prevent the U.N. Security Council from authorizing our action in advance, but a majority of the members of the council will not vote to condemn the strikes after the fact. It is now time for Congress to step up to its responsibility. The bargaining has already begun. But the use of force after the use of chemical weapons, with the world watching, is no place for partisan politics as usual. Opinion: Obama's irony, McCain's agony . Unless a clear majority of Congress opposes any action, it is incumbent on all those members who favor some use of force to craft a compromise that gives Obama the power to use both force and diplomacy as president and commander in chief to restore the chemical taboo and do whatever he can to reach a political settlement in Syria. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anne-Marie Slaughter.","Anne-Marie Slaughter: Obama right to go to Congress about using force in Syria .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court offered its tentative endorsement of so-called ""organizing agreements"" between unions and for-profit companies, with some justices saying on Wednesday the longstanding practice can encourage good labor relations. At issue is whether the particulars of such an agreement between Unite Here Local 355 and the Mardi Gras casino in Florida violates a federal law that prohibits companies from giving labor unions-- seeking to represent workers-- anything ""of value."" Worker rights experts and business groups have called this one of the most significant labor relations cases in decades, and a high court ruling could have major implications for the future of the union movement in the United States. The gaming union entered into a ""neutrality"" agreement with the company, agreeing to work together to pass a ballot initiative legalizing slot machines in Dade and Broward Counties, a deal that ostensibly would benefit both sides. Unite Here independently spent more than $100,000 in an ad campaign supporting the measure. It also agreed not to strike or boycott. The casino in return allowed union members onto the premises, gave them employee contact information, and agreed to remain neutral in the organizing campaign. The high court debated in oral arguments whether this particular agreement violated the letter and spirit of the broader law, designed to prevent bribery, corruption and extortion in negotiations and organizing. A lower federal appeals court said ""if the $100,000 bought the peaceful recognition provisions, then that's corrupt, and that is outside the exemptions that the law provides,"" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor. ""Tell me how I deal with that niggling problem I have about the $100,000, because it does feel like a bribe to the employer."" But Justice Elena Kagan said, ""I would have thought that the premise and the policies of the labor laws are to encourage a wide variety of employer/employee agreements,"" she said. ""The idea is to get these parties together to reach agreements on a wide variety of things that matter to them, regardless whether the labor law specifically refers to that."" The lawsuit was brought by Martin Mulhall, an employee of Hollywood Greyhound Track Inc., who opposed the union's efforts to get him to join. Backed by the National Right to Work Foundation, his lawyers said ""backroom deals"" between company and union management undercut his right of association and free choice. Section 302 of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 makes it a crime for an employer to ""pay, lend or deliver ... any money or other thing of value"" to a union that wants to represent its workforce. ""That's the danger that 302 exists to take care of, not that it's necessarily wrongful per se for a union to have lists of (employee) information or the use of property, but what will it do in return?"" attorney William Messenger told the high court in an intense hour of oral augments. ""And unions have compromised employee interests in exchange for this type of assistance. They certainly have extorted employers."" Several justices suggested the casino and the union were engaged in a quid pro quo, but were not sure that amounted to an exchange of something of ""value."" ""I mean, the union wouldn't promise that for nothing,"" said Justice Antonin Scalia. ""It would get something in exchange such as, in this case, the right to go on the employer's property to recruit union members or some other thing of value from the employer, right?"" But Richard McCracken, Unite Here's lawyer, said this neutrality agreement and the $1000,000 ad campaign were like so many others, including the pending deal to build a massive oil pipeline through the middle section of the United States. ""The union, like so many construction unions that we know, is advocating in Congress for the passage of laws like the Keystone Pipeline Law. Why did they do that? They do it because they want the jobs,"" he said. ""That is a combination of interests funneled through the First Amendment's protection for mutual effort."" Justice Anthony Kennedy seemed to agree, telling Messenger that his client's views run ""contrary to years of settled practices and understandings."" Unite Here represents about 265,000 active members in the United States and Canada, mainly in the hospitality, food service and manufacturing industries. The case is Unite Here Local 355 v. Mulhall (12-99). A ruling is expected by the spring.","Case involves agreement between union and Florida casino .

"(CNN) -- Ireland reached the quarterfinals of the rugby World Cup Sunday with an emphatic 36-6 victory over Italy at the Otago Stadium. Ireland topped Pool C ahead of second-placed Australia, and now play Wales in the knockout phase in Wellington next Saturday. They were 12-6 up as the second half began but put the game out of reach for Italy with two tries. Captain Brian O'Driscoll scored in the 47th minute after taking a well-timed pass from Tommy Bowe. Four minutes later left-wing Keith Earls marked his birthday by finishing a sweeping move with a try in the far corner after good work by center Gordon D'Arcy and blindside flanker Stephen Ferris. Ronan O'Gara, who landed six out of seven placekicks for a match haul of 16 points before being replaced by rival fly-half Jonathan Sexton, a less reliable goalkicker, duly landed the conversion. Ireland's traveling support virtually turned the match into a home game with most of the stadium bathed in green. Before the match Italy coach Nick Mallett had claimed his team boasted a better front row and would prove it. All Black star Carter ruled out of World Cup . But that dominance failed to materialize and neither side ever took full control. Earlier, Wales were in superb form as they thrashed Fiji 66-0 tn Hamilton. Jamie Roberts with two tries, Scott Williams, George North, Sam Warburton, Lloyd Burns, Leigh Halfpenny, Lloyd Williams and Jonathan Davies crossed in the rout. Hosts New Zealand also shrugged off the loss of star fly half Dan Carter to round off their Pool A campaign with a 75-19 victory over Canada. They ran in 12 tries with Zac Guildford leading the way with four. Colin Slade, the replacement for Carter, kicked four conversions and a penalty. The All Blacks will play Argentina in the quarterfinals next Sunday after the Pumas confirmed their qualification for the knockout stages ahead of Scotland with a 25-7 win over Georgia.","Ireland reach quarter-finals of rugby World Cup with emphatic 36-6 victory over Italy .

"(CNN) -- A JetBlue pilot isn't happy with his employer after being stuck on the tarmac of a Connecticut airport for some eight hours on Saturday. Neither are many of his passengers. Flights from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Newark, New Jersey, are usually uneventful -- two-plus hours of flight and then taxi to the gate -- but throw in a freak October snowstorm and it's a different story. JetBlue Flight 504 departed Fort Lauderdale at 10:07 a.m. ET Saturday -- 32 minutes late. The flight made it to Newark -- just not to the runway, thanks to the weather and was diverted to Bradley International Airport near Hartford, Connecticut. It landed at 1:07 p.m. What came next was an eight-hour ordeal for passengers -- and crew -- as the plane sat stuck on the tarmac with little food or water. ""I got a problem here on the airplane. I'm going to need to have the cops onboard,"" a flight crew member told the tower in a conversation posted on LiveATC.net, a website that monitors air traffic control conversations. ""I need some air stairs brought over here and the cops brought onboard the airplane."" Passenger Roseann Kozma explained the situation in a phone interview with CNN affiliate WTIC-TV from the plane. ""A couple passengers are fighting and there's a baby on here that's been crying the whole time,"" she said. ""We cannot go to the bathrooms anymore. There's no running water,"" said Todd Bailey, another passenger. ""They tell us that we're going to be going in soon, going in soon, going in soon -- and it just never happens."" Adding to the frustration and tension were passengers with medical conditions. ""I have a paraplegic that needs to come off,"" the pilot said. ""I have a diabetic here that's got an issue ... I've just got to get some help."" But the plane was still not at a gate, further frustrating the pilot. ""Look, you know, we can't seem to get any help from our own company,"" the pilot told the tower. ""I apologize for this, but if there is any way you can get a tug and a tow bar out here to us and get us towed somewhere to a gate or something. I don't care, take us anywhere."" The pilot, though frustrated, offered thanks to Bradley International officials. ""Listen, I just want to put in my two cents worth in for whatever it worth. Thank you very much,"" he said. ""It's Capt. Thompson over here on (Flight) 504 ... I think we've got more help from you guys than our own people."" The passengers broke into applause when the door finally opened, saying ""Let us out! Let us out! Let us out!"" JetBlue apologized for the situation and blamed it on a ""confluence of events,"" including intermittent power outages that complicated matters. ""We worked with the airport to secure services, but our flights were six of the 23 reported diversions into Hartford, including international flights (picture big jets carrying hundreds of people), the airline said on its website. ""Getting all the flights deplaned at the same time in a small airport is not unlike trying to get an elephant into a smart car; it's not an easy fit.""

"(CNN) -- Fifty years after President John F. Kennedy's assassination, there are very few down-the-line defenders of the Warren Commission to be found. The investigation into JFK's murder was inadequate, rushed and manipulated by powerful officials. Just consider a few of the commission's flaws. -- President Lyndon Johnson and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover had all but decided what the report would say -- that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman with no conspiracy -- within 48 hours of the shooting. -- The report was issued on a political timetable. LBJ wanted it out well before his election in November 1964. -- The FBI was less interested in the full truth and more determined to avoid blame for misreading Oswald's violent character. Hoover later admitted: ""We failed in carrying through some of the most salient aspects of the Oswald investigation. It ought to be a lesson to all."" -- Far worse was the behavior of the CIA, which coached some witnesses, hid others and withheld important information. The agency never told the commission it had been keeping tabs on Oswald or why. To this day, the CIA says it did not have a relationship with Oswald and that it is not withholding anything important about the assassination from the public. -- Even more suspiciously, the CIA maintained its subterfuge and continued to lie to yet another official JFK investigation in the 1970s, this one run by the U.S. House of Representatives. It was a chance to come clean, with lesser consequences, and the CIA didn't take it. The director of that study, Robert Blakey, now denounces the CIA and says he doesn't believe anything the agency told him and his panel. -- Both the CIA and the FBI failed to inform the commission about their various arrangements with the Mafia, another prime suspect in Kennedy's killing. They considerably underplayed Oswald killer Jack Ruby's organized crime ties. ""The evidence does not establish a significant link,"" the commission asserted, but in fact, Ruby was in frequent contact with mobsters. -- A surprising number of first-hand, close-in witnesses from Dealey Plaza on November 22 were never interviewed by the commission. These people had useful information to impart. I interviewed some of them, still living after the passage of five decades, and to this day they cannot understand why the commission was uninterested. -- The commission dismissed or ignored some compelling testimony that contradicted its preferred findings. Thus, the Warren Commission failed to find the full truth when the trail was hot, and when most Americans would have welcomed the most thorough possible investigation, even if the process was lengthy and costly. We can never recapture that moment, or reel in the cynicism that has developed because of its inadequacies. If we could go back in time, maybe it would be possible to figure out why the CIA was so interested in Oswald or why the FBI was so responsive when Oswald demanded to see its agents while he was in a New Orleans jail in August 1963. (Ask yourself whether the FBI would come running if you summoned it while incarcerated on a minor charge.) It would also be useful to know what really happened when Oswald visited the Cuban and Soviet embassies in Mexico City just two months before the assassination. With this extensive a list of shortfalls, is it any wonder the Warren Commission is widely derided? So, it may come as a surprise that, despite everything, a large part of the commission's basic conclusion turns out to be correct. Lee Harvey Oswald almost certainly was the man who killed President Kennedy. Under an alias, he had mail-ordered an Italian rifle from Chicago. The Dallas police found photos of Oswald holding a rifle, taken by his wife. Contrary to theories that float on the Internet, the pictures were not doctored. Oswald had demonstrated violent tendencies by attempting to kill Major Gen. Edwin Walker in April 1963. Oswald's wife has recalled that he had also made a veiled threat against former vice president Richard Nixon. Oswald's rifle was found, and his palm print was identified on a box inside the sniper's nest on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. The trajectory of the bullets fired from the open window essentially matches the wounds suffered by both President Kennedy and Texas Gov. John Connally, who was sitting a few inches lower and to the left of JFK in the jump seat in front of the president. After Oswald's first bullet missed the car entirely, the so-called ""magic bullet"" that struck JFK in the back was perfectly aligned to do substantial damage to Connally's body. And the final bullet that hit JFK in the head came from up and behind him, not the front. There is a reasonable physiological explanation for the actions of the president's body in the car once his skull was blown apart. Two Dallas reporters in the motorcade saw a rifle protruding from the window (though not Oswald himself, who was shielded). A depository employee watching the motorcade from the fifth floor window below the one with the gun testified that he heard the sound of a fast-moving bolt action rifle and brass cartridges falling on the floorboards just above his head. A homemade paper bag was left on the sixth floor, and the employee who gave Oswald a ride to the depository on the morning of November 22 testified that Oswald was carrying a parcel wrapped in brown paper that Oswald claimed was ""curtain rods,"" but which just as easily could have been a disassembled rifle. Oswald was the only employee found missing from the depository a short while after the assassination. Most of the ballistics and eyewitness evidence suggests that Oswald shot Officer J.D. Tippit later that afternoon -- hardly the deed of an innocent person. Oswald tried to shoot another officer at the Texas Theatre when he was captured a little while later, shouting, ""It's all over now."" Oswald was a deeply troubled man, a castaway who never fit well anywhere and could get along with few. He was someone yearning to be great but without the wherewithal to achieve it. At the end of his rope on November 22, 1963, Oswald had left his wedding ring and most of his money behind for his wife Marina and his two young daughters. He grabbed his rifle and planned to go out in a blaze of history-making glory by striking out at the ultimate symbol of power and success, a president who by pure chance would be passing by his place of low-level employment. Had Oswald not been killed by Jack Ruby, we probably would have learned as much in a few weeks or months. Yet the story doesn't necessarily end with Oswald. There is no question that many powerful individuals and groups, some with whom Oswald had personal association, possessed the means, motive and opportunity to kill President Kennedy. Was Oswald encouraged or manipulated in any way? Did anyone overtly or covertly aid him? After the assassination, were the FBI and especially the CIA simply trying to cover up for their incompetence in missing Oswald's nature and intent, or were there more sinister motives? So much time has passed that we may never know, but our one chance to discover more is in the release of thousands of additional pages of memos relating to the assassination, including hundreds of items from the CIA. After 50 years, it is absurd that anything is still hidden. Supposedly, the documents will be made public in a few years, but there is no guarantee. The Assassination Records Collection Act, signed by President George H.W. Bush in 1992, requires that all remaining documents about the Kennedy assassination be released by October 26, 2017. The next president will rule on any requests from the CIA and other agencies that materials be withheld or redacted after 2017. Under the law, the president can do so only if there is identifiable harm to our national security that outweighs the public interest in disclosure. But it's possible the CIA could succeed in having some memos held back and others substantially redacted. The right time came long ago for complete disclosure. Transparency cannot bring President Kennedy back, but at long last it can help America to come to terms fully with November 22, 1963 -- and perhaps to prevent similar events in our future.

Brian Holloway, a former offensive tackle for the New England Patriots, was in Tampa, Florida, during the holiday weekend when his son told him he was receiving tweets about a party at their home in Stephentown, New York, Holloway said. ""I thought it was a joke,"" he told CNN. According to a news release, the six suspects, who range in age from 17 to 21, turned themselves at the Rensselaer County Sheriff's office. A 19-year-old was arrested for ""organizing, advertising, and providing alcohol for the party,"" the police statement said. He faces two felony charges, including third-degree burglary, and two misdemeanors. Three of those arrested are accused of stealing a granite eagle statue and are facing felony grand larceny charges. Two others among the six arrested are accused of trespassing and providing alcohol to children. The party made national news after the homeowner, a former offensive tackle for the New England Patriots, reposted pictures and tweets from the party online. Brian Holloway said the 300 teens at the party did more than $20,000 damage to his home. He said some of the kids had been to other parties at his house.

"(CNN) -- Detectives on Saturday arrested the 12-year-old brother of Leila Fowler on a homicide charge in connection with his 8-year-old sister's death, Calaveras County, California, Sheriff Gary Kuntz said. The brother -- who Kuntz did not name, but did speak publicly after his sister's death -- was arrested at 5:10 p.m. (8:10 p.m. ET) at a county sheriff's office substation in his hometown of Valley Springs, according to the sheriff. ""Citizens of Calaveras County can sleep a little better tonight,"" Kuntz said. Leila Fowler and her brother were said to be alone on Saturday, April 27, in their family's northern California home when she was found dead. The 12-year-old told police that he'd seen an intruder leaving the home, then found his sister suffering from stab wounds. The 8-year-old died minutes after arriving at a hospital, authorities said. After the incident, police offered a sketchy description of the suspect as a 6-foot-tall white or Hispanic male with a muscular build. Hundreds flock to vigil for slain girl . They also interviewed registered sex offenders in the area, ran down leads and searched in attics, storage sheds and more in the rural, mountainous community located about 60 miles southeast of Sacramento. Authorities also combed the Fowler's home and neighborhood looking for evidence. ""We did collect fingerprints during that search,"" Calaveras County Sheriff's Capt. Jim Macedo said days after the attack, ""and we did collect what we believe to be DNA."" Kuntz said law enforcement officers ""put over 2000 hours into this investigation to provide Leila Fowler's family with answers in her death."" He declined to answer questions after giving his statement, including on the exact charges against the brother, where he is being held or when he will appear in court. The death of young Leila, known for her bubbly personality, shook the small town of Valley Springs, where purple ribbons, Leila's favorite color, were tied to stop signs.

"(CNN) -- It's hard to believe it's been five years since Mumbai was rocked by terror attacks. Life goes on, the city continues its chaotic beat. The next news story replaces the last one, the cycle of life goes on. The date 26/11 is now a somber anniversary the city marks. But for many, it's something much more personal. The newspapers here today are full of pictures of smiling couples and entire families who lost their lives during the attacks. They accompany messages of remembrance in ads placed their by surviving family members who miss them and grieve for them. Ten Pakistani men associated with the terror group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba stormed buildings and killed 164 people. Nine of the gunmen were killed during the attacks, one survived. Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the lone surviving gunman, was executed in India last year . One of the pictures I saw in a newspaper today that froze me was of a broken blue wall inside Chabad House, the building where Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife Rivka were killed. Their baby son, Moshe survived. My colleague, Sanjiv Talreja and I were the first journalists allowed inside Chabad House a few weeks after the carnage. It was the hardest assignment I have ever had. The place hadn't been cleaned. Walls and windows were blown out, only half of the floors and ceilings remained. Blood stains splashed across the wall, grenade shells and bullets littered the crumbling floor. One thing that stopped me in my tracks though was a broken blue wall. It was in the room that baby Moshe occupied. His mother Rivka had marked his height on the wall, with the enthusiasm of any young mother watching her baby grow. Several little pencil lines marked every inch or two this young boy grew. I remember standing by this blue wall in 2008, overcome with emotion, unable to get the cries of Moshe wailing for his mother out of my head. I had seen and heard him at a service at a synagogue a few days earlier. Moshe was saved by his Indian nanny, Sandra Samuel, who carried the boy through the gunfire and smoke to safety. Nanny credited with tot's daring rescue . Moshe is with his grandparents and his nanny in Israel. I think of this young boy often and I think of the families who lost loved ones during the attacks. My thoughts are with those who suffered bullet wounds, burns, trauma and injuries during the siege. Nanny who saved Israeli boy during Mumbai attack honored in Israel . Mumbai continues to throb.

"Washington (CNN) -- Mitt Romney's solid debate performance Wednesday night gives him the type of energy and momentum that President Barack Obama now will have to work overtime to undo. ""The thing that this debate did is it gave people reasons to think about (a) President Romney,"" said John Geer, chairman of Vanderbilt University's political science department. ""This often happens with challengers in the first debate. Now Obama needs to reconnect with the American public and (make the case of) why he should be re-elected."" According to a CNN/ORC International survey conducted immediately after the debate, 67% of registered voters who watched the debate said that the Republican nominee won, with one in four saying that President Barack Obama was victorious. Before the debate, however, another CNN/ORC national poll of likely voters showed that 56% felt Obama would win. What a difference a night makes. But poor initial debate performances rarely shift the tide of an election, experts say. Romney wasn't stellar, but Obama fell short . ""Obama can afford to lose this one,"" said Melissa Wade, a debate professor at Emory University in Atlanta. Historically, losing the first debate has the least impact on an incumbent president, she said. According to an analysis by Gallup, televised debates have affected the outcome of only two elections in the past half century -- Nixon-Kennedy in 1960 and Bush-Gore in 2000. Still, the stakes for Romney to pull off a good performance were high and, according to post-debate polls and commentators, he dominated the president. ""Romney has a message and he was finally able to deliver it. He stopped playing small ball,"" Geer said. ""Romney gets to play offense for a while. He can stress the message 'we can't afford another four years of this.' Talk about how (he's) going to get command of the economy. He has facts. The guy is smart."" 5 things we learned from the presidential debate . Obama now faces the task of recovering from his debate stumble. ""He was terrible last night and I don't understand why,"" Geer said. ""Obama didn't seem like he wanted to be there. He needs to be much more aggressive. He let Romney get away with stuff he shouldn't have."" Obama must work to slow Romney's traction. ""Romney gains a little bit of momentum. The big question in this is whether or not he can sustain it,"" said Andra Gillespie, associate professor of political science at Emory. ""At this stage in the game, with this race being as close as it is, you don't want to make unforced errors. Obama made unforced errors. That can't happen again."" Inside the campaign, there already appears to be activity around retooling its approach. ""Obviously, moving forward we will take hard look at this and make judgments where to draw lines in debates and how to use our time,"" said senior Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod Thursday in a conference call with reporters, adding that Obama is ""eager"" for the next debate. Obama and Romney returned Thursday to the campaign trail in battleground states. Obama wasted no time going back on the attack, accusing Romney of dishonesty over tax policy and other issues. ""If you want to be president, you owe the American people the truth,"" Obama said during a campaign stop in Denver. Romney's supporters, meanwhile, crowed about his performance, saying it reshaped a race that the former Massachusetts governor had appeared in danger of losing. ""He did exactly what he had to do for the undecided voter in Ohio or around the country,"" said Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who played the role of Obama in debate rehearsals for Romney. Body language: 'Romney was able to out Obama Obama' Campaign experts say the turnaround comes not a moment too soon. The Romney campaign spent much of September trying to recover from a series of gaffes ranging from his assertion that 47% of people were entitlement-dependent supporters of Obama to his politically-charged response to the violent attacks on U.S. embassies in Egypt and Libya. ""Romney did a good job of redeeming himself of all the gaffes of September. He gave a clear case of why he didn't think Obama deserved a second term,"" Gillespie said. But, with just a few weeks before the general election, Romney has to do a lot more than say Obama doesn't deserve a second chance, she said. ""You have to convince voters your vision is better,"" she said. ""It has to be consistent from here on out, or last night's performance was an anomaly."" Democrats tried to downplay the impact of Romney's debate win. ""I think that Governor Romney is certainly a skilled debater. And last night he was able to elevate his level of performance. But he did not change the fundamental dynamics of this race, nor did he change some of the policies that actually got us into the economic mess that we have,"" Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, a top surrogate for Obama, told CNN. Obama accuses Romney of dishonesty in debate . Both candidates have their work cut out for them heading into the next presidential debate October 16 in New York at Hofstra University. The town hall format is one that could easily trip both candidates, debate experts say. In town halls, Obama tends to sound too professorial and Romney runs the risk of coming off as stiff, Wade said. The unpredictable nature of the questions also sometimes throws candidates, she said.

"(CNN) -- We had a process. Congress proposed, and the president disposed with his signature. A law then went on the books. Courts might be asked to test its constitutionality, but by surviving legal challenges, a measure became the settled law of the land, which was the case with Obamacare. The American legislative system was, in spite of the disturbing influence of big money, actually quite elegant. But now it is broken. We have entered into an era of gunpoint government. Americans have discovered that a tiny, radical minority can immobilize their entire country and hold it as still as a robbery victim staring at the barrel of a pointed gun. And regardless of how this might anger the majority, they must live with the fact that it can happen again. And it likely will. Political accommodation for the common good is not even a consideration. Shutting the country down is the only objective, with no purpose beyond political destruction and personal ambition. Any argument that the temporary closing of the U.S. federal government did not accomplish anything, in this scheme, therefore, is wrong. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and his acolytes of extremism have cracked the Republican Party into two dissimilar parts. The corpus of the moderate version survives with frailties and reduced numbers that make its national leadership improbable in the foreseeable future, while the tea party offspring of the GOP remain vital, as they have felt the blood rush of being a bully. But neither part of the Republican Party won a thing. Except for the disdain of most Americans, and, possibly, much of the world. Global leaders undoubtedly wonder why the United States thinks exporting its version of democracy is sane. Political recalcitrance over the American debt ceiling threatened to toss international markets into chaos simply because a small cabal of conservatives did not like a new law to provide health care to millions of people who cannot otherwise afford premiums. Politics or petulance? The anger of the few in the minority was never supposed to be able to stop the will of the majority. The founders would be confounded. Exasperation, however, has to be tempered by the painful knowledge that we the people elected these people. Cruz of Texas, who has become the de facto leader of the national GOP and appears to be shepherding his party into a burning building, won office by defeating his state's lieutenant governor in a July runoff. The Texas tea party is made joyful by Cruz's exhortations, and in the obscure runoff 15 months ago, during the 100-plus-degree-burn of summer, they voted for him in big numbers, while moderates were hesitant to venture outdoors to even buy cold beer--or vote. The defeated David Dewhurst, his rival, who is still in office, clearly envies the network TV lights cast upon the neophyte Texas senator and has begun a rank imitation with calls for the President's impeachment. A reason hardly seems to matter. The inflammatory quote is what counts. But if we live in a democracy, don't we deserve what we have? Politics now is the art of screaming louder than the other person and claiming principles that are so profound they are more important than the preservation of the union. The streak of anarchy that runs through the politics of Cruz and the tea party ought to frighten sober Americans. His ideological strain thrives on the notion that government should do little more than protect the borders, pave the roads and then get the hell out of our way. Cruz is wrong, of course, and the obligations of liberty are considerably more complex. We might die to preserve our nation's principles but most of us won't kill our country to win an argument. If Cruz knew from the outset he was in an unwinnable fight, what was he really doing? What did he want? The obvious conclusion was that he lusted for attention to build a reputation among the tea party activists, whom he wants to begin thinking of him as their presidential candidate for 2016. They voted in disproportionate numbers to get him into the U.S. Senate and he hopes to animate that political base across the country and ride their cheers to the GOP nomination. Whether that happens is of considerably less importance to note than the fact that he was willing to jeopardize the lives and incomes of millions of Americans, along with global economies, simply to get cameras pointed in his direction. Is there any other conclusion? Cruz thinks he can speak directly to the voters and rise without the help of the political infrastructure of his party. Such an unconventional strategy may be his only hope, because there are few left in the GOP who will offer him any respect. The public has watched in abject horror as one office holder has pressed history's greatest democracy into a sausage grinder. And what has come out the other end is not immediately recognizable. Our deliberative government was not designed to be hijacked by a few dissidents. But fanatics have found a way to pry open the cockpit door and demand course corrections that put everyone on board at risk. Because of this, we may have no choice but to rethink the very mechanics of how we create law and run the nation. Cruz has at least done us the benefit of showing us that our system functions best as a platform for campaigning and getting re-elected and not for conducting the people's business; not even the disgraced Richard Nixon created such jeopardy with his betrayal. But it's our fault. We cast the ballots and gave office to Cruz and his compatriots. The politically craven have taken up arms to stop the peoples' business and the attention is intoxicating. They have no reason to put down their weapons. They like this game because now it only takes one person to storm the battlements that protect American democracy. Teddy got his gun . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Moore.","James Moore: Once elegant U.S. democracy now in era of gunpoint government .

"(CNN) -- On a clear dry day, driving 55 mph, it takes long-haul trucker Camille Pask the length of three football fields to stop her fully loaded rig. ""Just because we have more wheels doesn't mean we can stop faster,"" said Pask, whose truck can weigh as much as 80,000 pounds when packed. This is the busy season for Pask, who will be working through the Thanksgiving holiday to deliver goods for the Christmas shopping season. It's also the busiest travel period of the year for Americans, when travel veterans and amateurs converge en route to turkey dinners -- or just another day on the job. About 43.6 million people are expected to travel at least 50 miles from home between November 21 and November 25 for the holiday, an increase of 0.7% over last year. More Americans expected to hit the road for Thanksgiving . Everyone wants a safe, happy holiday, so we asked workers on the front lines of the Thanksgiving crush for their hard-earned tips for smooth travels. As Thursday rolls closer and the roads get more crowded with impatient drivers, Pask would like them to stay clear of larger trucks. Knowing that 80,000 pounds is barreling along in the lane beside you, why would you ever cut off a semi? Another tip: If you can't see her mirrors, she can't see you. And she can't ever see any cars that ride in tandem with her on the right side. ""That's one of our major blind spots for small vehicles passing us on the right,"" she said. ""It's a really dangerous spot to be."" Semi-truck driver rolls out big rig cuisine . Leave enough time for traffic jams . With about 39 million drivers hitting the road this holiday, travelers need to leave enough time for unexpected delays. A minor traffic accident can back up traffic for hours on some of the nation's highways. During the holidays, ""there are an awful lot of accidents,"" said Fran Ehret, a toll collector on the New Jersey Turnpike for 26 years and now president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers Local 194, which represents the turnpike toll collectors. Eatocracy: Sort out your Thanksgiving menu here . ""Leave enough time to get where you're going so you're not having to drive too fast,"" she said. If you don't regularly use toll booths and don't have an electronic pass to pay the toll, pay close attention to the signs directing drivers to cashier-staffed booths. ""You don't want to pull into an E-ZPass lane if you're paying cash,"" said Ehret. You could cause traffic delays, and ""you'll get a bill with a fee attached to it."" And please don't yell or curse out your toll collector or your fellow drivers because traffic is heavy or lanes are merging into the toll plaza. Pay your toll and drive on! ""People's personalities change when they get behind the wheel of their cars. You meet them in their personal lives and they wouldn't act like that,"" Ehret said. Research air travel security rules . There is no getting around it: All 3 million travelers flying to their destinations during the Thanksgiving holiday will have to pass through Transportation Security Administration checkpoints. Some of them will be traveling with food for the feast. The TSA has posted special guidance online for travelers toting culinary creations. More air travel means more airplane maintenance . TSA officers Jackie Fitzpatrick and Charles Link promise they don't want to take away your pies. Really. ""We know there's pressure to make that plane or you're traveling with family or bringing special foods you don't want to get squished,"" said Fitzpatrick. ""It's all about the pies at the holidays,"" added Link. ""Apple, coconut. Testing will be done, but (pies) are allowed."" Fitzpatrick and Link, who supervise security checkpoints at New York City's LaGuardia Airport, are going Italian on Thanksgiving Day and will be making pasta salad and baked ziti, respectively, for staff potlucks. For travelers working their way toward a friend or family's table with a tasty contribution, just do a little advance research at the TSA website to know what you can bring and how much you can bring. In the case of your specially made foods, they might need a little extra security, and they can't violate the agency's 3-ounce liquid rules. The agency also has a mobile app that provides information on checkpoint wait times, prohibited items and airport status. Video games fall under the laptop rule and must be placed in a separate bin as they go through security machines. And snow globes can't be larger than a tennis ball. If you're getting a head start on Christmas, don't wrap presents beforehand. The TSA may have to unwrap gifts, which could be sad if your child sees the light saber that Santa is bringing him. And no toy guns or weapons, please. They won't be allowed to pass through security. It doesn't matter that they're not real weapons. Security officials won't allow anything weapon-like because it might scare your fellow passengers or the crew. People with medical issues should call TSA Cares (855-787-2227) before they travel to see if they need to take any extra steps or if they qualify for extra assistance to clear security. What's your commute's toll on your health? Don't overpack . Southwest Airlines flight attendant Barb Pool can spot the travelers who have overpacked and rushed to get to the airport in time. Pool advises travelers to pack in advance, check as much baggage as possible, research TSA rules about what you can bring, and leave behind contingency supplies that will be available at your destination. (Southwest allows two free checked bags, JetBlue allows one, and some airlines let frequent fliers and airline credit card holders check a bag for free.) ""Do whatever it takes to not stress,"" said Pool, who often celebrates the holidays in advance with her family. ""People get on a plane and are stuck for so many hours. It's not a fun journey if you're stressed."" Pool tends to find joy in many of her flights, whether it's holding a baby as nervous parents stow their bags, talking to military personnel heading home on leave, or helping people with disabilities get settled. ""Most of the time they're preoccupied, but every once in a while they'll offer to take you home for Thanksgiving,"" she said. ""Elderly people especially realize you're not going to be with your family."" She also knows that something larger might be stressing out her customers. ""Everyone's not always traveling for happy events,"" she said. ""They might be fighting tears. It could be their first year without a spouse or they're going to a funeral. Everyone's not going to Grandma's for dinner. I try to be extra sensitive to it.""","More than 43 million Americans are expected to travel over the holiday, 39 million by car .

"Washington (CNN) -- Rep. Peter King's goal is to thwart Muslim radicalization, but some people fear his hearings could have exactly the opposite effect. Some counterterrorism experts believe shining a harsh spotlight on the Muslim community could play into the jihadist narrative that the West is at war with Islam and encourage more people to participate in terrorist activity. Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, says King is unfair if he blames the entire Muslim community for the actions of a few. ""I think his approach is going to radicalize young people,"" says Awad. King -- a New York Republican -- says he is holding the hearings because the Muslim community has not cooperated sufficiently with law enforcement. On Wednesday, Attorney General Eric Holder contradicted that. ""Tips we have received, information that has been shared has been critical to our efforts to disrupting plots."" But King disagrees. He characterizes New York as the ""epicenter"" of terrorist activity and says he is unaware of any good information coming from the Muslim community to police in the city or surrounding counties. A recent study from the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security said tips from the Muslim community thwarted 48 out of 120 terrorism cases involving Muslim Americans, though some experts say the data may not be complete. Law enforcement officials say the Muslim community is key to finding and disrupting terrorist plots, but the degree of cooperation varies from community to community and mosque to mosque. Asked whether King's hearings might have a negative impact on the outreach efforts of the FBI and other law enforcement, Holder responded indirectly, saying, ""We don't want to stigmatize. We don't want to alienate entire communities."" ""We need to focus on individuals or groups of individuals who might band together and who would try to harm Americans' interests or American citizens. That's what this department is doing."" King's retort: ""I don't want to demonize anyone, either. But talk to [Deputy National Security Director Dennis] McDonough. He said al Qaeda is attempting to radicalize the American Muslim community. So if we are going to look for radicalization from al Qaeda, where else would we look?"" Some Muslims said they believe King's approach could backfire and diminish cooperation. ""I don't know if Representative King realizes it, but that's the real danger to all of this,"" says Robert Marro. Marro, a Muslim convert, worships at the All Dulles Area Muslim Society in northern Virginia. The imam at the mosque said he has made a video that attempts to counter the jihadist message, and he has cooperated with the FBI and local police. Imam Mohamed Magid says the upcoming hearing will not change his stance. ""Human life is sacred, no matter who that person is. And therefore committing an act of terrorism or taking innocent life is a sin. Absolutely a sin."" Magid says King is wrong to say the Muslim community has not done enough to counter radicalization, and he fears the hearings could result in further isolation. That worries 25-year old Yasmin Shafiq as well. She worships at the mosque. ""I can certainly see Muslims becoming more introverted, and you definitely don't want introversion when it comes to issues of radicalization. You want people to be communicative and receptive and open to opinions and ideas,"" she says. There is no easy way to spot someone who has been radicalized. The Muslims who have been arrested in connection with domestic terror plots have varied in age, education and sex. Some are converts, others are lifelong Muslims. Some were born overseas, others in the U.S. There is no one path to radicalization that would allow for easy detection. Charles Kurzman of the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security has looked at individuals who have been radicalized and says some of them were ideologically committed and were looking for opportunities to engage in violence. Kurzman says other individuals simply may have fallen into terrorist activities by accident. He adds, ""then there were others who seem to have been hangers-on, for lack of a better word."" Frank Cilluffo of George Washington University has studied radicalization. He says one of the most important things the King hearings could produce is a commitment to better understand how radicalization occurs, who is susceptible and how the jihadist message can be neutralized. ""We don't have a full honest-to-goodness, methodological approach that is empirically sound yet,"" Cilluffo says. Cilluffo is not alone in thinking the hearings could have a positive impact. Other experts agree they have to the potential to build understanding. But, they warn, the tone as well as the substance will be key.","Some experts worry that a harsh spotlight could encourage terrorist activity .

"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- Quincy Jones moved to Seattle as a child and discovered a passion for music that would bring him global success as a musician, composer and producer. He talks to CNN about music, working with Michael Jackson, and the city he grew up in. Quincy Jones: ""You have to believe and trust yourself."" CNN: How would you describe Seattle? Quincy Jones: Seattle is like a global gumbo, a melting pot with all kinds of people -- the rich, the poor, white people, some Chinese, Filipino, Jewish and black people -- they're all here. CNN: What was it like when you first arrived in the city? Quincy Jones: It was diametrically opposite to where I'd come from. I was born into a black ghetto in Chicago, during the depression. Where we came from, there were machine guns, there were gangsters everywhere. At 11 years old we broke into a building to get some lemon meringue pie. As we were leaving, I spotted a splendid piano in the corner. I put my hands on the piano and somehow every cell in the body, everything in me knew that's what I would be doing for the rest of my life. It's just astounding. That moment changed my life. CNN: Why is revisiting your old high school in Seattle important to you? Quincy Jones: It's easier to get to where you think you want to go if you know where you come from. The diversity here in the 1940s was awesome. As a kid, education is what provides you with a foundation. This is one of the greatest high schools America has ever seen. Garfield [High School] makes my heart and soul smile. It's astounding the people that came out of this place --Jimi Hendrix and Bruce Lee went to school here. Everyone keeps saying, ""What's in the water?"" CNN: Your remarkable career started here in Seattle... Quincy Jones: I always wanted to be a trumpet player. By the time I got to Garfield [High School] I was starting to be pretty good. I was in all the bands at the school -- concert bands, dance bands, the gospel bands. Back then, Ray Charles and I used to pretend we were older than we were so that we could sneak into the jazz clubs around the city. Later we started playing in nightclubs; it was brilliant. See photos of Quincy in Seattle » . CNN: You are, arguably, best known for producing Michael Jackson. How did that come about? Quincy Jones: When I was a musical director we were working together on a film project. He asked me to help him find a producer for his first solo album. Watching him was incredible. He would learn everybody else's parts -- the dialogues, the songs, the dance steps -- and I saw something in him. I saw a part of him that had never been exposed before. We went all the way to Michael's soul at that time and it was am amazing experience. CNN: You're also credited with discovering the talk-show host Oprah Winfrey for the film ""The Color Purple"", which you co-produced with Steven Spielberg. Quincy Jones: I was watching television one morning and I saw this lady on a Chicago station. I thought that if she could sing and act then she is who we're looking for. One thing led to another and Oprah came in for a screen test. You know the rest. She's a lady who is touched by God -- such an incredible woman. Whoopi (Goldberg) is the same. It was a great experience, as a producer, doing my first film with Spielberg. I was glad that I had all of that wonderful family to work with. CNN: Tell us about recording the song ""We are the World"" in 1985 to raise money for the famine in Ethiopia. Quincy Jones: Lionel Richie (who co-wrote the song with Michael Jackson) called and asked me to be involved in a project to help Africa. I guess they wanted somebody who was crazy enough to work with lots of different people. Everybody flocked to record this song, including Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, Dan Aykroyd, Bob Geldof... CNN: You've often said that music gave you your freedom, how is that? Quincy Jones: Music to me, at that time became a passion. It was even deeper than that because we had a strange family background. My mother was in the mental institution since I was seven, with dementia. Things weren't working out in the family sense. I didn't know my mother so I made a pact with my soul and said if I don't have one I don't need one, and I made music my mother. Watch Quincy Jones on My City_My Life » . Probably if I had a great family I would have been a pitiful musician, you never know. Music became my mother and it was a passion -- a total passion. CNN: What's your approach to life? Quincy Jones: I'm always prepared and I mix science with the soul. You do whatever it takes to get that balance. You have to turn all of your drunken dreams into sober realizations. I think I was blessed with the ability to see things and make them happen before everybody else saw them -- whether it's with Oprah or Michael or Will Smith, who I also discovered (for the television program ""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air""). You have to believe and trust yourself. CNN: You have achieved remarkable success, yet you are very humble. What will your legacy be? Quincy Jones: I hope that on my tombstone it says ""Born 1933, died 2043"". I hope that's my legacy.","Musician, composer and record producer Quincy Jones grew up in Seattle .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Convulsions of violence followed the fierce clashes that killed dozens of people Sunday in Egypt, when Muslim Brotherhood supporters clashed with their opponents and security forces. By Tuesday, the death toll from Sunday's violence climbed to 55. That number could continue to rise, as some of the 250 injured could succumb to their wounds. On top of that, six Egyptian soldiers have died in attacks since Sunday. In the city of Port Said, a group of attackers shot and killed an Egyptian soldier on Tuesday, according to state-run media. And on Monday, Islamist militants in the Sinai killed five Egyptian soldiers in the town of Ismailia, state media said. In the village of Al-Tor, they set off a car bomb that killed two people and wounded 48, state media reported. Jihadists have stepped up their assaults since Egypt's military forcibly removed former President Mohamed Morsy from office in July. Elsewhere in the country, his supporters continue vent their anger in the streets despite the muscle government security forces have applied to suppress and disperse them. Sunday's violence . Early Sunday, Muslim Brotherhood protesters marched in different neighborhoods in Cairo and across the country. In Egypt's capital, people swam across the Nile River to escape arrest as military armored personnel carriers supported police clearing the streets of protesters. Tear gas filled the air, and security forces with batons beat some of the protesters they detained. It was another powerful sign that Egypt's military-backed interim government will go to almost any measure to shut down the Muslim Brotherhood's protests. But in nearby Tahrir Square, the scene was drastically different; throngs of people celebrated Egypt Armed Forces Day at a festive event that included dancing and fireworks. As thousands of Muslim Brotherhood protesters marched along the Nile from Old Cairo toward Tahrir, security forces blocked their path and quickly dispersed the crowd. Quelling the Muslim Brotherhood . In a statement, the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party decried what it called ""crimes of violence and murder committed today against peaceful protesters."" The group also said it holds the leaders of the coup that ousted Morsy responsible. Egypt's Interior Ministry said it had arrested 423 ""rioters"" on Sunday. In September, an Egyptian court banned all activities of the Muslim Brotherhood and froze its finances, drawing complaints from the international community. At the United Nations General Assembly, Egypt's interim foreign minister sought to quell these concerns. Nabil Fahmy said Egypt will hold elections in the spring. He also argued that the political process is open to all ""as long as they are committed to the renunciation of violence and terrorism and acts of incitement to them."" On Sunday, protesters from the Muslim Brotherhood said they would accept nothing less than the reinstatement of the government led by Morsy. But supporters of the military in Tahrir Square remained adamant that that shouldn't happen. Neither side appeared willing to compromise. Violent clashes after relative calm .

"(CNN) -- Michael Hoey held off a last-round charge from U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy to claim the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship at St Andrews Sunday. Hoey, who like McIlroy hails from Northern Ireland, carded a final round 68 to beat his illustrious compatriot by two shots on 22-under 266. McIlroy, looking for his first win since claiming his first major in such emphatic style at Congressional, carded a seven-under 65 at the home of golf but came up just short as overnight leader Hoey kept his nerve on the closing holes. Graeme McDowell completed the domination of players from Northern Ireland by claiming joint third on 18-under with George Murray of Scotland after a 69. South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen, playing his first tournament at St Andrews since his British Open victory on the famous links in 2010, was in a three-strong group a shot further back with Marc Warren and joint halfway leader Tommy Fleetwood. World No.1 Luke Donald could not build on his nine-under third round 63 and finished in a tie for ninth as he bids to top the money list on the European and PGA Tours. But it was Hoey who eventually upstaged the big names, leading after his third successive 66 going into the final day and then maintaining his composure as McIlroy went to the turn in just 30 to mount his expected challenge. He came to the last with a one-shot lead over McIlroy and after a big drive needed just a deft chip and a putt to close with a birdie to seal his triumph. The 32-year-old was claiming his second victory of the year after struggling for so long to break into the big time. ""It hasn't sunk in yet and it won't for a while,"" Hoey told the European Tour website. ""It's taken a long time but I supposed in a weird way you enjoy it more because you have struggled through six goes at the qualifying school,"" he added. McIlroy, who was seven-under for his first 11 holes on the final day, was disappointed to miss out on victory. ""I've been very consistent, which is a good thing, but I want to get wins and that's the most important thing. ""It's good to be one, two, three and see all of us boys up there, I'm just obviously disappointed that it wasn't me lifting the trophy.""

"(CNN) -- Riyo Mori is a classically trained ballet dancer who won the 2007 Miss Universe beauty pageant. She talks to CNN about Tokyo, dancing and baseball. Trained ballet dancer Riyo Mori was crowned Miss Universe in 2007. CNN: What made you decide to enter the Miss Universe competition? Riyo Mori: My Grandmother. Japan, 50 or 60 years ago, was very conservative. Women had to stand behind men and never talk, never give an opinion -- and my grandma was different. I love her so much. She found out that there was Miss Universe Japan and that's how everything started. She said, ""Riyo, you're young, you can dance, you can teach dancing, you love it, it's good -- but maybe you should see a different world. Just go for it."" And I said, 'OK' and now I'm here. CNN: What's it like for you to be back in Shizuoka? Riyo Mori: It's so nice to be back home. I can relax, I can sleep. This is my first vacation, I think -- just having fun with my family, my friends, and talking to my friend in a café. That was my normal life before and since I became Miss Universe it suddenly stopped. I always have to be in the mood, and I have to be Miss Universe, so this is just perfect for me to be in my hometown of Shizuoka. CNN: How would you describe your relationship with Tokyo? Riyo Mori: I love Tokyo, like I love New York; I love big cities. The first time I came to Tokyo was even before becoming a finalist for Miss Universe Japan. I was so excited. Also I was scared too, because people look so fashionable and people look so confident here and I was just a tourist from the countryside. I was very nervous. People from all over the world come to see Tokyo, and so that's why you can see very unique people here. People speak Spanish, French, German, English, and Japanese; there's a very mixed culture here . CNN: How would you define Tokyoites? Riyo Mori: I feel like people are so energetic here, so different from Shizuoka. People keep moving -- they never stop. Tokyo never sleeps. Tokyo people are so busy all the time. I wouldn't say they are cold, they're just busy; they don't have time to talk to others. I need a balance, I have to be in Shizuoka for maybe 50 percent of the year and I have to be in Tokyo too, because I need this energy. CNN: How did you become a dancer? Riyo Mori: I started to learn dance in mother's dance school. My mom is my best friend, of course, my mother and teacher. So we have very unique relationship. We are not just mom and daughter, we're also teacher and student. My mom teaches jazz dance, tap dance, modern dance, but she doesn't teach ballet. I thought I should learn how to teach ballet, so I can have different class than she has. So I went to Canada when I was 16. I went to high school and professional ballet school in Canada. It was very, very tough, but it was worth it now that I can teach ballet. Now I want to teach young people, through dancing, how to be positive, patient and happy. These three things are very important to me. Dancing means a lot to me, because dancing is my life, part of my life. I have been dancing for a long time -- maybe 17 years. Dancing is great because this is how I express myself; this is where I learned how to be confident. CNN: What was your mum's reaction to you winning Miss Universe? Riyo Mori: She was very happy when I won Miss Universe --'my daughter can travel the world and see people' -- see the culture that she couldn't. So she was very happy. CNN: Outside dancing, what else do you enjoy? Riyo Mori: I'm a huge fan of baseball. Baseball fans here in Japan are very supportive and crazy. They can go crazy too, but that's a good part of Japanese people -- if you like something, you're very into it and support it. CNN: What else do you love about the city?

"(CNN) -- ""One of the biggest things that I suffered with initially was sickness, especially on the ovals, getting dizzy ... you get out of the car after 10, 15, maybe 20 laps and you couldn't walk straight. I found it very difficult."" Of all the sensations you'd want to feel when driving a car at over 200 mph in front of thousands of spectators, and with the rest of the grid bearing down on your rear wing, it's fair to assume dizziness is not one of them. Even if you're Nigel Mansell, one of the most successful drivers in motorsport history, and especially not when -- like the Formula One star did when he switched to IndyCar racing in 1993 -- you're plunged into a completely alien environment. For the Englishman, a rookie acclimatizing to the pressures of racing in one of America's most popular track events, it was the kind of experience where you crave a supportive word or two from a veteran of the scene. Mansell recalls: ""A.J. Foyt was very funny, he said: 'You're in a foreign country, boy, don't turn right -- you'll eat concrete.' And I thought, 'What? Thanks!' A.J. was really fun, lots of very useful tips ..."" Foyt, in 1977, became the first driver to win the Indy 500 four times, and ran his own team after retiring -- but the Texan couldn't match Mansell's unique feat. Only four men have managed to win titles in both IndyCar and F1, such is the challenge posed by the jump between the two disciplines. Only one has reigned as champion in both at the same time. Despite his dizziness, Mansell pulled off a remarkable achievement. Driving the all-conquering Williams FW14B, he was crowned world champion for the first and only time in 1992, having been runner-up the year before -- after coming agonizingly close to the title in 1986 and '87. However, his glorious 13th season in Formula One ended in his retirement following a dispute with Williams, and he headed across the Atlantic in search of a new challenge. Mansell accepted an offer by the Newman-Haas team to drive in the CART series. His aggressive driving style, plus the steely resolve forged by his earlier F1 setbacks, helped him take America by storm. After notching up five wins he took the title and, for three precious weeks, held two of world motorsport's most coveted prizes. ""Winning the IndyCar championship was something incredibly special, it helped to convert the Americans,"" the 60-year-old told CNN's The Circuit ahead of this weekend's United States Grand Prix. ""I remember, I think it was an NBC television broadcast in Indianapolis the first year I was there, they were really knocking me on television saying, 'Has anyone told this rookie he can't overtake on the outside?' ""And then just as the commentator said it, the other commentator said: 'Well, he's just done it so I guess no-one's told him!"" Mansell, talking at his new museum on the island of Jersey, which sits in the English Channel, has fond memories of his time across the Atlantic -- which was followed by a brief return to F1 with McLaren and a similarly unsuccessful stint in touring cars. ""There were 90,000 fans wishing me happy birthday for my 40th birthday on the race track in New Hampshire,"" he said. ""We converted a lot of people who wouldn't believe in grand prix drivers in America, and I had a blast and it was fantastic. We've got so many good friends over there, and I think all the sponsors, everybody who looked after us over there, were such great people."" Mansell, who will be one of the race stewards on Sunday in Austin, believes no current F1 driver ""is crazy enough"" to attempt the switch to IndyCar. He feels many of them have their talents masked by the technical and tactical nature of the current F1 setup, which has been dominated for the past four years by Sebastian Vettel. ""This is the misunderstanding now, because with the tires they have underneath them, they're not able to 'gorilla' the tires. And now this is a misconception of Vettel and Red Bull,"" said the former Ferrari driver. ""Vettel is able to set his car in a very, very neutral way and he looks after his tires better than any other car. Predominantly, that's because ... he's a class act. He's four-time world champion, I mean, that's an amazing feat!"" High praise from a man who sold his house to get his first drive, suffered chemical burns in his first race for Lotus and broke his neck and vertebrae in his back in pursuit of his sole F1 title. ""Life and death was almost, well, certainly a monthly thing. Back in the 1960s and '70s, when we started, and then obviously late '70s and early '80s and all through '80s and early '90s, people regularly got seriously hurt and unfortunately died too. So, it was part of the scene. ""What's amazing for me -- if you look at the footage even in the 1990s -- the drivers get out the car half dead, wringing wet, completely expelled of all energy. At Monaco this year, you saw them get out of the car and you think they've just come from the hairdressers!"" Times may have changed but experience like that of Mansell's is seen as a valuable commodity by teams such as Mercedes, which benefits from the wisdom of three-time world champion Niki Lauda -- who is non-executive chairman of the German marque. ""I don't think anybody can afford me, that's the problem,"" Mansell replied when asked if he could play a similar role. However, his desire to race still burns strongly. ""As you get old, your body tells you that you can't be there anymore. Although I have to say, with the Red Bull and the British Grand Prix this year, I did put my hat in the ring for the drive,"" Mansell revealed. ""There'd be certain races I'd definitely be very competitive to win. For a bit of fun I said, 'Please consider me. I'm not over the hill yet,' but I didn't get the call back!""","Nigel Mansell is the only driver to hold F1 and IndyCar titles at the same time .

"Virginia Beach, Virginia (CNN) -- Emergency calls highlight the confusion in a Virginia Beach, Virginia, neighborhood after a Navy fighter jet crashed last week, with one woman reporting that a pilot was on her patio awaiting medical aid. Authorities released recordings of the calls on Monday, three days after the F/A-18 Hornet slammed into an apartment complex about two miles from the naval air station where it took off. ""Nobody's here, and I keep calling and there's no ambulance,"" one woman told a 911 dispatcher from her condominium a few blocks from the crash site. She said one of two fliers who ejected from the stricken warplane was outside, that he was conscious and that she had already called for help. ""He's still on my patio, but they told me to evacuate, and there's other guys there helping him,"" the unidentified woman says. ""My neighbor's there helping him."" Seven people, including the two-person crew of the Hornet, were injured when the aircraft crashed into a Virginia Beach apartment complex on Friday. But there were no fatalities, a fact that Adm. John Harvey called a ""miracle"" over the weekend. ""A Navy plane just went down on 24th Street,"" a man says in another call to dispatchers. ""It hit an apartment complex and I saw the, um, the pilot bail out. The pilot did bail out -- I saw it -- but it hit the apartment complex."" The aircraft experienced a ""catastrophic mechanical malfunction"" during takeoff from Naval Air Station Oceana on Friday, raining jet fuel over Virginia Beach before plunging to the ground, according to residents and Navy officials. It landed upright and in flames in the middle of the courtyard of the Mayfair Mews apartment complex, setting five surrounding buildings on fire. ""There's a terrible fire at the Mayfair Mews apartment building. ... Oh my God! It's like something keeps exploding or something,"" another woman tells dispatchers. The jet carried a student pilot in the front seat and an experienced instructor behind him, and the leakage of jet fuel was ""one of the indications that there was a mechanical malfunction,"" Navy Capt. Mark Weisgerber told reporters. The plane was part of a training squadron at Oceana and was not carrying live ordnance. The Navy said Monday that investigators have recovered the flight recorder from the Hornet. The device, which records flight data but not cockpit voices, has been sent to a Navy air base at Patuxent River, Maryland, for analysis, Navy officials said in a written statement Monday afternoon. The wing and part of the fuselage of the plane were being moved to Oceana for further study, but the remains of the jet's twin engines will remain at the crash site for now as investigators study them, the U.S. Atlantic fleet's aviation arm reported. The Navy expects to finish removing most aircraft debris by the end of the week as part of its investigation. And the service will soon begin cutting compensation checks to the people who lost their homes in the crash, said Rear Adm. Tim Alexander, commander of the Navy's Mid-Atlantic region. ""We are committed to doing the right thing to address the needs of these families, who through no fault of their own have endured an incredible hardship,"" Alexander said. ""We owe it to everyone affected by Friday's accident to help them get their life back together."" Initial payments will begin at $2,300 per person to cover immediate needs, such as housing, meals and clothing. The amount will increase for additional family members. Counseling and legal services also will be available, Alexander said. Residents who completed claims by Saturday could receive payments by Monday. CNN's Barbara Starr and Sandra Endo contributed to this report.","NEW: ""A Navy plane just went down on 24th Street,"" a caller told dispatchers .

"(CNN) -- A year ago, Kate Upton was a pretty young woman. Perhaps not typically model-pretty as The New York Times has noted, but certainly fetching. In the old days, to go from, well, hot to famous, Upton would have needed not just looks but a truckload of luck, for fame was something bestowed by capricious media out to sell their next movie or magazine. But in the Age of the Internet, all it took was a YouTube video of Upton doing ""the Dougie"" at a Los Angeles Clippers game. It went viral, and now Upton is on the cover of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. Fame isn't what it used to be. In the old days, fame was controlled not by the famous and certainly not by the audience, but by the owners of the media. It was so foreign and artificial a construct that we thought that fame made you special. The rules didn't apply to you. You had a certain ethereal glow. A glow of fame. Now that the Internet has pulled fame inside out, you don't need to be blessed by the mass media to become famous. To paraphrase Andy Warhol, on the Internet, everyone will be famous to 15 people. In fact, everything important about fame has changed. To begin with, it used to be that the famous were foisted on us. If they wanted to make ""Rosie the Waitress"" famous for mopping up spills with a paper towel, they could. If they wanted to make talentless dream boys famous, they did. Now fame is something we do -- we the audience, we the people on the Web. There's nothing very complicated about how we do it: We create links, and we pass them around. That is the most basic and natural thing to do with a Web like ours. So, if you happen to come across a video of a fan-made Harry Potter musical spoof, in which you are struck by the presence of a young man named Joe Moses playing Snape, of course you'll tell your friends using your social media of choice: You tweet, you post on Facebook or you might go old-fashioned and send out some e-mails. Some of your friends will share your enthusiasm, so they retweet, repost, resend. With astonishing rapidity, the Harry Potter musical accumulated more than 3 million views on YouTube, and young Moses has 41,651 followers on Twitter. Moses, a bartender in Brooklyn, is famous on the Internet. After winning the Internet, Kate Upton takes SI's swimsuit cover . This is possible because the basic idea of media has been transformed. In the days of broadcast, a medium was a channel through which messages were passed, connecting the publisher with the audience. Not on the Internet. On the Web, the medium isn't the message. The medium is the audience. So, when someone becomes famous on the Internet, it's because We the Medium decided to move that person's message along. And this gives rise to two odd Web phenomena. First, on the Web we sometimes make people famous for inexplicable reasons. For example, one of the first Web-famous people was Mahir Cagri, a Turkish photographer whose home page (remember them?) welcomed viewers with a big ""I KISS YOU!!!!!"" message. Mahir's page was the opposite of slick, and his enthusiastic explanation of his interests was in less than perfect English. There was absolutely no reason in 1999 for his page (which had been slightly ""enhanced"" by hackers) to go viral. But it did. Certainly some who passed around the link did so to make mean-spirited fun of a man who turned out to be something of a sweetheart. But many who shared the link to Cagri's page did so in part because it asserted that we the audience could make an obscure person famous overnight. It was ""sticking it to the old media"" that had for so many years rammed commercial nonentities into our brains. And it's happened countless times. That we can now can make people famous also explains the deglamorization of fame on the Internet. The people we make famous and sometimes rich are usually people like us. They're flawed. They make spelling errors when they tweet from their mobile phones. They treat us with a rough but real respect. They are people such as comedian Louis CK, who used the Web's power to bypass the standard marketing machinery and offer his standup video for download on his own site (he made $1 million in 12 days). He is loved by his fans not despite his flaws, but because those flaws show that he is one of us. And don't even ask about what happens when a celebrity ventures onto the Web thinking fame makes him not one of us. (Amirite, Woody Harrelson?) Now, all of this is complicated because we are in a hybrid culture that is shaped both by the broadcast media and by the Internet. Internet celebrities cross over into the mainstream, and the traditional mainstream star-making machinery still works. Just look at the Web's complex relationship with Justin Bieber and Rebecca Black. Nothing is simple, especially fame, now that the audience is the medium and fame is of, by, and for us.

"(CNN) -- Before the October 1 rollout of Healthcare.gov, a key concern was whether the Affordable Care Act system would create a ""death spiral"" for insurers. That crisis could be precipitated by an unenthusiastic response from younger, healthier Americans. These are the people whose high premiums and low demand for services are necessary for the risk pools to assume the costs of covering pre-existing conditions at community-pricing rates, as well as buffering the premiums of older and needier Americans. Instead, the emerging ""death spiral"" crisis is one of the credibility for the White House and the idea that big government-program interventions work better than the private sector those interventions seek to reform. The Department of Health and Human Services had 42 months and $400 million to create an operational Web portal that connects Americans who now are required by law to buy coverage from insurers, while connecting to the IRS to qualify people for federal subsidies in the exchanges. For the last several months, HHS and the White House assured everyone that the system development was on track for an October 1 launch. Democrats fought a pitched battle against Republicans over the last month to keep the GOP from forcing a delay of the rollout. Now, suddenly, the idea of a delay has moved from the ramblings of ""anarchists,"" as Harry Reid described Obamacare opponents, to mainstream Democratic thought. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from deep-blue Connecticut, told a panel on MSNBC on Thursday that the mandate needs to be delayed, depending on ""how soon these glitches are going to be solved."" That will depend, Blumenthal said, on ""leveling with the American people."" That honesty has been in short supply. More than two weeks into the crisis, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told CNN's Sanjay Gupta that President Barack Obama had no inkling of the failure until he read about it in the papers, which follows a pattern of denials at the White House. Sebelius also implied that the failure took her by surprise too, even though the ACA was her agency's highest priority over the last 42 months, and the system failed a light-load test days before the launch. Sebelius must have also missed the August report from the HHS Inspector General pointing out major flaws in the system and its testing, even though Reuters managed to notice it. Even former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs called the notion that the White House didn't know about the Healthcare.gove problems ""unbelievable,"" while National Journal's Ron Fournier called it ""either a lie ... or an unfathomable lack of oversight."" It could also be both, which is the possibility that now has Democrats doing a 180 and suggesting or demanding delays in the rollout. Constituents fear dealing with IRS penalties for failure to buy insurance through a system they can't access and HHS can't fix, or even predict when it will be fixed. Even those who have managed to buy insurance through the site now have to wonder whether their insurers have their correct data. Meanwhile, Obama and Sebelius now want to reassure Americans that they have a grip on the problem ... by bringing in the private sector to fix what the government failed to execute. Rarely have we seen such a confluence of incompetence, irresponsibility, and prevarication all at the same time. The death spiral of White House credibility won't just damage Democrats in the short run, but it will damage the agenda of advocates of activist government for years.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Two U.S. Air Force F-15s escorted two Russian Bear long-range bombers out of an air exclusion zone off the coast of Alaska, U.S. military officials said Wednesday. Two U.S. Air Force F-15s were dispatched to meet the Russian bombers. U.S. radar picked up the Russian turbo-prop Tupolev-95 planes about 500 miles off the Alaska coast. The U.S. fighters from Elmendorf Air Force Base were dispatched to meet the bombers and escorted them out of the area without incident, the officials said. The United States maintains the air exclusion zone off the coast of Alaska, barring unidentified aircraft or aircraft that don't file flight plans inside that area. The last case of Russian aircraft approaching the U.S. coastline or ships in the Pacific was in February. Then, four Bear bombers flew near the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz, with one of them flying about 2,000 feet from the Nimitz's deck. Russia's Defense Ministry said at the time there was no violation of flight regulations during the incident. A ministry official described the flights as standard operating procedure for air force training. Meanwhile, U.S. military officials say the incidents are not a concern. They say it's the Russian military flexing its ability and presence. E-mail to a friend .","U.S. radar picks up the Russian planes about 500 miles off the Alaska coast .

"(CNN) -- The video calling service Skype recently made a change to how it routes calls. Yawn, right? But here's where it get a little juicier: Hackers and bloggers are saying the changes, which push some of the video calling process onto Skype's own computers instead of onto random machines on the Internet, could help the app spy on users' calls, presumably at the request of a court or government. ""Reportedly, Microsoft is re-engineering these supernodes to make it easier for law enforcement to monitor calls by allowing the supernodes to not only make the introduction but to actually route the voice data of the calls as well,"" Tim Verry, from the website ExtremeTech, wrote last week. (Supernodes are third-party computers that act as a sort of directory service for routing calls.) ""In this way, the actual voice data would pass through the monitored servers and the call is no longer secure. It is essentially a man-in-the-middle attack, and it is made all the easier because Microsoft -- who owns Skype and knows the keys used for the service's encryption -- is helping."" Other news outlets, including Forbes and Slate, picked up on the discussion. Forbes says there is ""tremendous buzz"" in the hacker community on this topic. The problem? It's unclear what exactly changed, and a Skype spokesman contacted by CNN for clarification would not release more than a pre-written statement. Chaim Haas, the spokesman, would not say, for instance, if the update actually enabled the company to tap into and record Skype calls. He also would not answer questions about when the update took place or whether wiretapping was a motive. ""As part of our ongoing commitment to continually improve the Skype user experience, we developed supernodes, which can be located on dedicated servers within secure datacenters,"" the statement from Skype says. ""This has not changed the underlying nature of Skype's peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture, in which supernodes simply allow users to find one another (calls do not pass through supernodes). ""We believe this approach has immediate performance, scalability and availability benefits for the hundreds of millions of users that make up the Skype community."" Skype, which grew out of the peer-to-peer downloading network Kazaa and how has 254 million ""connected"" users per month, has a long reputation for guarding the privacy of its callers. Skype calls usually are routed from one caller to another, rather than through a middleman. ""Historically, Skype has been a major barrier to law enforcement agencies,"" writes Ryan Gallagher at Slate. ""Using strong encryption and complex peer-to-peer network connections, Skype was considered by most to be virtually impossible to intercept."" For technical reasons, this meant that Skype actually could not comply with an order to wiretap a particular Skype user's conversations, a spokeswoman told the tech news site CNET in 2008. ""We have not received any subpoenas or court orders asking us to perform a live interception or wiretap of Skype-to-Skype communications,"" the spokeswoman said. ""In any event, because of Skype's peer-to-peer architecture and encryption techniques, Skype would not be able to comply with such a request."" But after the recent change, some insiders are speculating that such digital eavesdropping may indeed be possible. The difference involves the third-party ""supernode"" computers. Until recently, those supernodes were other Skype users who had fast Internet connections and could handle the work. Now, according to Skype's statement, those supernodes have moved onto computers owned by Skype, which is owned by Microsoft. That has some people concerned. Haas, Skype's spokesman, wrote that ""it is also important to note that Skype calls DO NOT (emphasis his) pass through supernodes -- they act in a directory function only."" He added: ""As was true before the Microsoft acquisition, Skype cooperates with law enforcement agencies as is legally required and technically feasible."" This seems to mean that Skype can't intercept calls just because it owns the supernodes now. The spokesman, however, declined to answer follow-up questions on this point. Others are unsure what it means. ""I'm a little bit surprised and slightly skeptical about that statement"" about how calls ""do not pass through supernodes,"" said Peter Eckersley, technology projects director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Maybe in most cases calls would not actually pass through a supernode in a way that they could be tracked, Eckersley said, but, for technical reasons, some types of computer connections may require a call to route though a supernode. If you are really truly geek fluent, Eckersley's question for Skype may interest you: . ""If two Skype users are firewalled so that they can only make outbound TCP connections and cannot make UDP connections, how do you route a call between those two users?"" Eckersley said he can't think of an answer, aside from pushing a call through a supernode, which now would be on a Skype- or Microsoft-owned computer. In any event, Eckersley said, this update may not be all that significant in the big picture. His group already does not recommend that people who live in authoritarian regimes use Skype, because of the relative likelihood that communications could be tapped. In dangerous places like Iran and Syria, using a service like Gmail is safer, he said. ""As of 2012 we don't believe the Skype architecture is secure,"" he said. ""There are a lot of people out there, a lot of governments out there, that have the means to break Skype, and this remains true regardless of whatever Microsoft just changed."" More from CNN Tech: .

"(EW.com) -- Remaking a landmark film ought to be a perfectly respectable proposition. After all, we see new versions of Shakespeare or Tennessee Williams all the time (whether on stage or screen). What's wrong with doing an updated version of a beloved Hollywood movie? In theory, nothing, yet in practice, it seldom works out well. There's something about how movies, with their singularity of mood and density of detail, imprint themselves on our imaginations that places the prospect of a remake somewhere between a rock and a hard place. Think about it: If you follow the original too closely, duplicating signature shots or lines of dialogue or acting flourishes, then you're stuck in a mode of mindless imitation — and what's the point of that? People might as well just watch the great version they already know (or, for new generations, have yet to discover). But if you seriously update the movie in question, making a lot of eyebrow-raising changes, then you risk violating the essence of the original — or leaving out too much of what everyone loved about it in the first place. When you get down to it, a ''new'' version of a classic is a contradiction in terms. Carrie, the rapturous and terrifying 1976 Brian De Palma thriller based on Stephen King's first novel, is a movie that has earned its place as a quirky horror milestone without, perhaps, ever having quite attained the status of a masterpiece. Yet I personally think it's a great film. There's nothing that compares to its glittery fusion of dreaminess and dread — of Cinderella-at-the-prom fantasy and blood-bucket horror, all mixed up with elements of '70s teensploitation comedy and primally entangled mother-daughter tragedy. And what acting! Sissy Spacek, as the squashed-nerd telekinetic high school wallflower Carrie, and Piper Laurie, as her ragingly repressed Evangelical mom, achieved a tremulous power together. And De Palma, a prankish virtuoso, perched the whole thing on the knife's edge between sincerity and satire. Carrie is a timeless movie because it's both one of the most passionate and most scandalously funny horror films ever made. So what does one do for a remake encore? Kimberly Peirce, the gifted director of the new Carrie, has gone down what seems, on the surface, to be a savvy road. She follows De Palma's version quite faithfully, evoking everything from his camera angles to his lighting to his flying-object F/X to his gleeful staging of mean-girl antics. At the same time, she offers just enough tweaks and updated details to present the material in a new way. The fabled shower-room scene, in which the naïve, sheltered Carrie White (Chloë Grace Moretz) gets her first period and is shocked into thinking that she's dying, now has an added fillip of cruelty: Chris, the most hateful of the girls, doesn't just pelt Carrie with tampons and shout ''Plug it up!'' She records the whole ordeal on her smartphone and then posts the video. In a neat reversal, Chris and her best friend, the popular but far more empathetic Sue (who feels so guilty about what happened that she gets her boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom), are both portrayed against type: Nice-girl Sue is played by Gabriella Wilde, who looks like a vintage snooty princess, whereas the awful Chris is made into a pensive bohemian punk by Portia Doubleday. And Carrie's mother (Julianne Moore), a fundamentalist fanatic who tries to cut Carrie off from the world, is now herself a cutter who pinpricks her own flesh in secret. Moore makes her fierce, guilt-tripping, and scary — but not, in the way that Laurie did, almost religiously possessed. Despite being 40 years old now, the Carrie story lives quite comfortably in the 21st century. Here's the problem, though. The original film had King's ingenious plot, with its fusion of innocence and cruelty and that subliminal wink of demonic takeover, but it also had De Palma's voluptuous operatic style, which gave the story the quality of a daydream-turned-nightmare. When you take away that style and serve up the plot fairly straight, as Peirce does here, we seem to be watching a Carrie that's been flattened, robbed of its over-the-top emotional extravagance. Given the challenge of revamping Spacek's brilliant shivery-nerd-turned-avenger performance, Chloë Grace Moretz does a creditable job. In stiff hair and lumpish clothing, she's very much the geek outsider (though today there's a much greater context for geeks as heroines), and the emotions seem to bleed through her ghostly, lunar-pale skin. Yet the way Peirce has updated Carrie White, without making any overt changes to the character, is to portray her as a little less clueless, a little less pathetic, a little more defiant. She's now a cute, bright, painfully shy girl who sees herself (wrongly) as a loser. Before, she was a total walking blob of misery and dysfunction. That slight tonal shift robs the story of its masochistic edge. Of course, Carrie isn't merely a fable of adolescent agony. It's all about Carrie's revenge, once she's subjected to the most diabolical practical ''joke'' in movie history. Carrie's telekinetic powers, driven by the rage she represses, allowed De Palma to orchestrate a senior-prom apocalypse that was pure filmmaking mastery. Peirce stages the prom as a prosaic rerun, without a lot of gaudy inspiration. And it's here that the real problem with redoing a classic reveals itself. Sure, a lot of famous movies are timeless, yet they're also rooted in their time. In the original Carrie, Spacek's character seemed to be channeling something creepy and larger-than-life — maybe it was even the underworld. But now we're a lot more accustomed to seeing movie characters mold their destiny through special effects, and since Peirce films the climax in a rather depersonalized, shoot-the-works way, Carrie comes close to seeming like an especially alienated member of the X-Men team. She blows stuff up real good, in a way that would make the devil — or Bruce Willis — proud. Grade: B-- . See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- At least 14 people, including 10 students, were killed when a Syrian fighter jet bombed a high school in northern Syria, opposition activists said.

"(CNN) -- Angola's ruling party was declared the winner of weekend elections Sunday after taking nearly three-quarters of the vote. With about 85% of the boxes counted, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) had 73% of the nearly 4.9 valid votes cast, according to figures from the country's National Electoral Commission. The MPLA's nearest rival, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), trailed far behind with 18%. Seven other parties split up the rest of the vote. The win means a new term for President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who has held power since 1979, the state-run Angola News Agency reported. Under the terms of a constitution approved in 2010, the leader of the party that won Friday's parliamentary vote automatically becomes Angola's president. Friday's election was only Angola's third since it gained independence from Portugal in 1975. The country was wracked by civil war for the next 27 years, and the vote was widely viewed as an indicator of the country's progress after a decade of peace. Elections in 1992 were abandoned midway and led to an outbreak of further violence. The MPLA won a 2008 parliamentary vote with a landslide 82%, with UNITA, its former civil war enemy, the leading opposition in the 220-seat National Assembly. UNITA saw its share of the vote nearly double from the 10% share it won in 2008. The movement has alleged fraud in previous elections and voiced concerns about apparent irregularities in election campaigning this time around. But on Saturday, UNITA spokesman Alcides Sakala said his party would recognize the election results, the ANA reported. They include the scheduling of the vote only three days after a public holiday for the president's birthday, questions about voter rolls, and ""what seems like a concerted effort by certain security forces to tell people in rural areas that if they do not vote for the ruling party, the country will be back to war,"" said Domingos Jardo Muekalia, UNITA's deputy secretary for external relations, speaking at the Chatham House think tank in London. In 1992 and 2008, there were ""substantial irregularities -- some intentional such as manipulation, fraud and intimidation and others resulting from inexperience,"" he said. Human Rights Watch also accused the government of ""numerous incidents of political violence, intimidation of protesters, and crackdowns on peaceful demonstrations,"" in a report issued on August 1. ""The human rights environment in Angola is not conducive for free, fair and peaceful elections,"" said Leslie Lefkow, deputy Africa director for the rights monitoring group. ""The Angolan government needs to stop trying to stifle peaceful protests, gag the independent press or use the state media for partisan purposes if these elections are to be meaningful,"" Lefkow said. Angola, sub-Saharan Africa's second-largest oil producer, pumps out more than 1.9 million barrels per day and boasts an expanding investment portfolio in its former colonial power, Portugal, and in other parts of Africa. But despite big spending on infrastructure and social programs since the end of its brutal civil war in 2002, corruption, poor governance and economic inequality remain serious issues for much of the country's population of about 18 million. Angola ranked 168th out of 183 countries on Transparency International's 2011 Corruption Perceptions Index, and was 148th out of 187 countries in the U.N.'s Human Development Index. A number of small but consistent demonstrations have taken place in Angola since last year, revealing a growing frustration with the economic hardship that many still face in the country. Over the last few months, civil war veterans have taken to the streets to demand overdue subsidy payments, and disgruntled youths and civil rights activists have staged rallies to voice their concerns about the lack of jobs and opportunities. The protracted civil war killed up to 1.5 million people, according to the CIA World Factbook. About 4 million people were internally displaced, more than half of them children, the United Nations said. After peace was established, the country faced the challenge of reestablishing civil institutions, rebuilding damaged infrastructure, clearing land mines and demobilizing large numbers of former fighters.

"(CNN) -- South Korean fisherman Jeon Wook-pyo set out on a boat in the Yellow Sea more than 40 years ago -- and didn't get home till Friday. Jeon's return to his family in Seoul from North Korea raises more questions than answers, and underscores the larger issue of alleged abductions by North Korea. Jeon, now 68, escaped last month from North Korea to a country which has not been identified publicly, where he wrote a letter to South Korean President Park Geun-hye, appealing for help to return to Seoul. Is Dennis Rodman smart on North Korea? ""I took a chance to escape the North because I had a growing wish to spend the rest of my life with my relatives and brothers at home,"" he wrote Park, according to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency. Jeon reunited with his family in the South Korean capital on Friday after undergoing questioning by South Korean officials, a Unification Ministry official told CNN. North Korea: Reality vs. the world according to Dennis Rodman . Jeon and two dozen other fishermen were abducted from two boats off South Korea's western coast on December 28, 1972; none of the others has returned, Yonhap said. South Korea was not aware that Jeon had been abducted by North Korea until 2005, when a photograph from 1974 surfaced showing him at an indoctrination camp in North Korea with several other abducted South Korean fishermen, according to South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper. Abductions have long been a source of conflict between the Koreas, who have maintained tense relations since their 1950-53 conflict. The Korean war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty, meaning the two sides are still technically at war. Obama marks 'forgotten war' in Korea . South Korea has accused North Korea of abducting its citizens for intelligence-gathering or propaganda purposes. Pyongyang has denied holding any South Koreans against their will. Just how many South Koreans may have been abducted is unclear, said Ron Redmond, a spokesman for the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea. ""It's a difficult thing to assess, because lots of times, these cases don't turn up for a year,"" he said from Geneva. ""Nobody knows what happens; they disappear."" The South Korean government said that, since the armistice, about 3,500 of its citizens have been abducted by North Korea, most of them at sea during the 1960s and 1970s, Redmond said. Though most have been freed, the government says that the whereabouts of about 500 are unknown, he said. Other countries, including Japan, have also accused North Korea of abductions. Tokyo has cited 17 cases of Japanese nationals abducted by Pyongyang, according to Giuseppe Calandruccio, also with the U.N. commission. ""There are many other cases where there are suspicions, but nobody can prove it,"" he said. Last month, more than 40 witnesses -- some of them recently arrived from North Korea -- testified before representatives from the U.N. inquiry commission in Seoul, and they detailed horrific abuse at the hands of their captors.  A report from the commission is due in March. One of those who testified was Jeong Kwang Il, a North Korean defector once worked for a North Korean trading company that he said dealt with China and South Korea. That ended abruptly in 1999, when he was arrested by government security agents, he said. ""These people were beating me with clubs, and they said I should confess that I am a spy. But I told them. 'I'm not a spy.' But they kept beating me -- for two weeks."" After undergoing ""pigeon torture,"" in which he was hung upside down with his hands cuffed behind his back, he confessed to what he told the commission he had never done. ""I could not endure this any more so I confessed that I was given a spy's job from South Korea,"" he said. ""I had given up."" Jeong said he was then taken to a political camp, where he spent three years before he was released to discover that his home was no longer where it had been, and he could not find his family. ""I felt betrayed,"" he said. ""I decided that I was done in North Korea."" After a year-long escape route that took him through China, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand, Jeong arrived in South Korea in 2004, where he has started a new life, but not forgotten the old one. ""Even if they give me a lot of money, I will not go back to that country,"" he vowed. The U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea was established in March by the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate ""systematic, widespread and grave violations of human rights in North Korea.""

"(EW.com) -- ""Modern Family creator"" Steve Levitan said Sunday night's Emmys were a buzz-kill due to producers over-stuffing the ceremony with tributes to fallen celebrities. The telecast featured the usual ""In Memoriam"" slideshow, plus five break-out tributes scattered throughout the evening honoring talents such as James Gandolfini, Jonathan Winters and â€” most controversially â€” Glee co-star Cory Monteith. Plus, there was a ""power of television"" segment touching on John F. Kennedy's assassination. With all those black suits in the audience, one could have easily mistaken the Emmys for a funeral. Levitan first made a reference to the ceremony being the ""saddest Emmys of all time"" while on stage to pick up his award for Modern Family winning best comedy series. Later he told EW the endless tributes dragged down the emotional flow of the show â€” particularly for host Neil Patrick Harris. ""Listen, nobody is more respectful of those who have come and gone and made a mark in this business, but I believe the Emmys should be a celebration about all that is exciting and wonderful about television,"" Levitan said. ""All those people are very deserving, and other people are deserving too. I thought it was too sad.

"(CNN) -- A growing religion in southern Africa is posing a threat to the survival of wild leopards. For the Nazareth Baptist Church, also known as the Shembe, leopards are seen as a symbol of pride, beauty and wealth, while their skins are viewed as essential attire for church elders who wear them around their necks during traditional ceremonies. A mixture of Christianity and Zulu culture, the Shembe is one of the biggest traditional religious groups in South Africa with around 5 million members. There are fears from conservationists that as the church grows, Africa's leopards, already listed as ""near threatened"" by the International Union Conservation of Nature (IUCN), will be pushed towards extinction. ""From visiting a few of these (church) gatherings, you realize that it's not 92 or 100 or 200 (leopard skins). We are talking about thousands of leopard skins,"" said Tristan Dickerson, a conservationist at the Phinda Game Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal province. Dickerson first found out about the Shembe in the course of helping with a police investigation, after a pile of at least 92 leopard skins was uncovered during a village raid. Many of those skins had been tailored into clothing meant for the church group. Besides being killed by farmers trying to protect their livestock, 150 leopards are legally targeted by trophy hunters each year. But increasingly poachers kill them to profit from their use in traditional medicine and ceremonial dress. ""What we are finding is that they are actually being targeted, instead of it being by-catch from the illegal bush meat trade,"" Dickerson said. ""They are actually putting poisons out to target leopards because there is such a high demand for leopard skins now."" The feline species is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, or CITES, and the sale or possession of its parts is illegal in South Africa. Those who wear it as traditional gear, including Zulu royalty and high-profile individuals like President Jacob Zuma, are required to have permits issued by the state. But at Shembe church gatherings, trade in skins is done openly with no law enforcement. Dickerson's attempt to solve this conflict of tradition and conservation has taken him to China where he has been trying to find a suitable fake fur alternative for church members. ""I went to Beijing and spent a week there, meeting with factory representatives to try and develop this fur into the level that was needed and the quality that was needed,"" Dickerson said. And the quality is crucial, because while the church's leadership has warmed to the concept of fake leopard skins, they still have to approve of the product. Dickerson says the church's followers will only be converted to fake items if the leaders say it is acceptable. On a recent trip to Ekuphakameni, South Africa, where the church was founded, Dickerson visited a church gathering and showed his fur samples to a senior preacher. ""It's beautiful, but it's not the real thing,"" said the preacher, Mhlanubanzi Mjadu. ""It's like a blanket. After some time, it will wear out. Real leopard skin can last for more than 20 years."" Mjadu said he had no idea trade in leopard parts was illegal, and he did not know that the leopard was a threatened species. He said that as an elder he could not wear a fake costume, but he could see a place for fake fur in the church as membership continued to swell and the prices of leopard skin seemed to be rising. ""It will help the congregation and protect the leopard from extinction,"" he said. Dickerson is also hoping that church followers who cannot afford the real thing would find the cheaper version an enticing alternative, but so far they have not shown enthusiasm. At the gathering in Ekuphakameni real skins were being sold for $440 each. ""We are improving the product as we speak,"" Dickerson said. ""If we can get one of the leaders to wear one of these things and say to the people, 'This is accepted from now on, we do not wear real leopard skins anymore, we have an alternative,' that statement... would be the pinnacle of this whole project.""","Followers of the Shembe religion in southern Africa strive to wear leopard skins during church gatherings .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Kenyan and English police officers are conducting an ""active search"" for an English tourist kidnapped from a remote Kenyan resort, a local police spokesman said Friday. ""We cannot stop the search,"" Kenya police spokesman Charles Owino. ""We do not take security lightly in Kenya."" Owino told CNN that the search was focused on the border regions of Kenya and Somalia and through a ""significant network"" of contacts across the border. An English couple staying at a remote safari lodge on the coast, near the border with Somalia were attacked early Sunday. David Tebbut was shot dead and his wife, Judith Tebbut, was abducted, police said. The couple had arrived at the hotel Saturday afternoon after spending a week in the Masai Mara game reserve in southwestern Kenya. They were the sole guests in the hotel, which has cloth doors. ""From what we can be able to gather, he resisted, and that's why he was shot dead,"" Kenyan Police Commissioner Mathew Iteere said Sunday. ""Maybe they wanted to take the two, but he resisted and that's why he was shot dead."" Kenya's economy depends heavily on tourism and Kenyan officials publicly and privately worry that the case will affect the industry, which took years to recover after the bloody post-election violence in 2008. ""We are putting in a lot of effort because this really affects our nation. We want to believe that God willing, that we find her,"" said Owino. He said that two suspects have been interrogated in the case and hinted that the kidnapping at a luxury resort could have been an inside job. ""There are strong indications that someone at the resort was acting maliciously,"" said Owino. ""We are looking at those leads very strongly."" There is speculation as to who attacked the resort and kidnapped Tebbut, but very few solid facts have emerged as to who carried out the kidnapping and where the victim was taken. A maritime security source aware of the situation said Sunday that Islamic militants probably took Judith Tebbut by boat toward Ras Kamboni in Somalia. Iteere said the motive was not known. ""We are treating it just as a bandit attack,"" he said.","Judith Tebbut was abducted, her husband was killed .

Barcelona were back in the game three minutes after the break when Joel Veltman was shown a red card for bringing down Neymar inside the penalty area. Xavi converting the spot kick but the home side held on for a vital win. ""We played a good match,"" Ajax coach Frank de Boer said afterwards. ""They are not used to being under so much pressure as we created in the first-half, nor a team that builds from the back,"" he added. ""We deserved to be 2-0 ahead at half-time. The (penalty) decision was key because it is a red card and a goal, but we fought hard."" Barcelona had already qualified for the knockout stages but will need a win in their final match against Celtic at the Nou Camp to guarantee top spot in the group. In the other Group H match, Scottish champions Celtic had a disappointing night at Celtic Park going down 3-0 to AC Milan. Goals from Kaka, Cristian Zapata and Mario Balotelli means that Milan remain in second with nine points but Ajax are now one point behind on eight and will qualify if they can beat the Rossoneri at the San Siro in the final round of Group H matches on December 11. In Group F, Arsenal took a big step towards the knockout stages with a 2-0 win over Marseille at the Emirates Stadium. Two goals from Jack Wilshere in the first minute and 65th minute mean the current English Premier League leaders are on 12 points and only need to draw their final group match against Napoli to qualify top of the group. Last year's beaten finalists Borussia Dortmund kept their hopes of qualification alive with a 3-1 win against Napoli at Signal Iduna Park. Jurgen Klopp's team, who are now level on nine points with Rafa Benitez's side, will travel to Marseille in their final qualifying match. Meanwhile in Group E, Basel have a 100% record against Chelsea in Group E after snatching a late winner at St Jakob Park. Mohamed Salah's 87th minute strike means the Swiss champions leapfrog Schalke into second with eight points, one point behind Chelsea who, despite the loss, have qualified for the knockout stages. Schalke's 0-0 draw with Steaua Bucharest on Tuesday leaves them on seven points meaning that the German side need to beat Basel in their final match to qualify for the last 16. In Group G, Atletico Madrid and Zenit St Petersburg drew 1-1. The Spanish side, who had a 100% record in the group before Tuesday's tie at the Petrovsky Stadium, took the lead with an Adrian Lopez goal in the 54th minute but a goalkeeping error by Thibaut Courtois 20 minutes later proved costly. The Belgian keeper misjudged a deflected cross from Igor Smolnikov which looped into the net to hand Zenit a vital point in their quest to qualify second in the group. Porto could only draw 1-1 with Austria Wien. The result leaves the Portuguese champions in third with five points and means they will have to get something out of their trip to Atletico on December 11 to stand any chance of qualifying.","Barcelona slump to first defeat under Gerardo Martino against 10-man Ajax .

"(CNN) -- A former campaign staffer for San Diego Mayor Bob Filner became the second woman to publicly accuse him of sexual harassment, saying Tuesday that the then-congressman patted her ""posterior"" while at a fundraising event. Laura Fink, who now runs a political consulting firm, told KPBS-TV that it happened in 2005 when she was working as Filner's deputy campaign manager. Fink said she didn't go public with the incident at the time because she was trying to build her political career. But she said she now feels emboldened to tell her story after Filner's former spokeswoman, Irene McCormack Jackson, sued him for sexual harassment Monday. Jackson said Filner subjected her and other women to ""crude and disgusting"" comments and inappropriate touching. She said she resigned as Filner's communications director in June after deciding the mayor would not change his behavior. ""I had to work and do my job in an atmosphere where women were viewed by Mayor Filner as sexual objects or stupid idiots,"" Jackson said. She said Filner asked her to work without underwear and made repeated sexual advances toward her. ""He is not fit to be mayor of our great city. He is not fit to hold any public office. A man who lacks character makes a mockery of his ideas,"" she said. Fink told KPBS on Tuesday that the incident happened as she was escorting Filner from table to table at a fundraising dinner. At one point, she said, someone at the event told Filner that Fink had ""worked her ass off"" for him. ""He turned to me and he said, 'Turn around,' "" Fink said Tuesday. ""And as a staffer, I know it sounds silly to just do it, but you just do it. And so I turned around and he proceeded to take his hand and pat me on my posterior and laugh and say, 'No, it's still there.' "" Fink gave the station a copy of an e-mail she sent to Filner in which she asked for an apology. A few days later, KPBS reported, Filner mumbled ""I'm sorry"" but told her she didn't understand what happened. Filner has been battling allegations of sexual harassment for several weeks, but none of the women leveling those claims came forward before Jackson filed her suit in state court. Her lawyer, Gloria Allred, called on Filner to resign, telling reporters, ""Apologies alone will not take care of this injustice."" In a statement issued Monday evening, Filner said he was ""saddened"" by the accusations, but ""I remain committed to the people of San Diego and the work that needs to be done."" ""Once due process is allowed to unfold, I am certain there will be a better understanding of this situation,"" he said, adding, ""I humbly ask that through this vicious storm of controversy, people take a moment and temper their rush to judgment."" Filner said last week that he believes he will be vindicated by ""a full presentation of the facts."" But he has also acknowledged, ""I need help,"" and added, ""I'm clearly doing something wrong."" ""I am embarrassed to admit that I have failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me, and that at times I have intimidated them,"" Filner said in a statement earlier this month. ""It's a good thing that behavior that would have been tolerated in the past is being called out in this generation for what it is: inappropriate and wrong."" The 70-year-old Filner served five terms in Congress before being elected mayor in 2012. He says he will not resign. Jackson said she decided to resign after Filner's deputy chief of staff resigned in June. Filner ""refused to listen to someone he had known for 35 years, and who told him explicitly, during a senior staff meeting, that his behavior with women was terrible and possibly illegal. Filner ""laughed it off,"" she said. She said Filner challenged her to provide one example of improper behavior; when she brought up his comments about wearing underwear, ""he had no comeback,"" she said.

"(RealSimple.com) -- Statistics say you'll catch two to four colds this winter. Here's help to stave them off. Sleep . How it helps: Sleep regulates the release of the hormone cortisol, which stimulates cells that boost the immune system, says Dr. William Ellert, chief medical officer of the Phoenix Baptist Hospital. And a well-tuned immune system is crucial for defending against the cold virus. Getting at least seven hours of shut-eye is the easiest way to steer clear of the common cold. In fact, a recent study indicates that people who fall short are nearly three times as likely to catch a cold. To make bedtime even more healthful, try using a protective pillow cover, which can help prevent a stuffy, runny nose. Good to know: If you have trouble falling asleep, try a mind-calming exercise.

How it helps: Research has shown that moderate exercise -- 30 to 90 minutes most days of the week -- increases immune function and reduces your chances of catching a cold. Key word: moderate. Prolonged high-intensity exercise can actually make you more susceptible to sickness, according to research from Appalachian State University, in Boone, North Carolina. Good to know: Don't swear off workouts if you do get a simple head cold. A 2009 study at the University of Illinois found that moderate exercise can also help you recover from a cold more quickly than normal. RealSimple.com: Cold and flu prevention . A hot -- and cold -- shower . How it helps: Temperature fluctuations jump-start your immune system, says Donielle Wilson, a naturopathic doctor in New York City. At the end of a shower, stand under the hottest stream you can take for 30 seconds, then turn the temperature to cold for 10 seconds. Repeat three times, finishing with cold. Good to know: A steamy shower helps keep nasal passages clear and can prevent cold-causing bugs from taking up residence in your nose. RealSimple.com: What causes a cold or the flu? Oysters . How they help: These mollusks contain more of the mineral zinc than any other food, and zinc has been proven to support and enhance the immune system. Eating just a single oyster will give you a whopping 13 milligrams of zinc. That said, since it may be difficult to work them into your diet regularly (oyster sandwich for lunch?), look to zinc-fortified breakfast cereals, baked beans, and pumpkin seeds to help you get the recommended eight milligrams a day. Good to know: Zinc is also effective when taken at the first signs of a cold. Oral lozenges that contain the mineral, like those made by Cold-Eeze and Zicam, have been shown to decrease the duration of colds. Vitamin D . How it helps: According to a 2009 study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, people with low levels of this vitamin, which helps to regulate the immune system, are more susceptible to catching colds. (The vitamin has also been shown to increase calcium absorption and reduce inflammation.) Multivitamins typically contain 400 international units (IU) of vitamin D, which falls within the current recommended daily allowance (RDA) of 200 to 600 IU. However, experts now suggest taking a 1,000-IU supplement on top of a multivitamin, as strong evidence indicates that the current RDA is too low. Good to know: If you drink a lot of milk; frequently eat fatty fish, like salmon; or live in a sunny climate, you are probably getting an adequate amount, says Ellert, since these all increase your body's stores of vitamin D. RealSimple.com: The Vitamin D debate . Nasal Rinse . How it helps: Neti pots and irrigators cleanse the nasal passages with a saltwater solution. ""A daily saline rinse helps sweep bacteria, viruses, and irritants from the respiratory tract,"" says Ellert. With a classic neti pot, the solution is poured into one nostril, travels into the sinuses, then drains from the other nostril. Today a battery-powered irrigator can be easier and more comfortable to use (try the Waterpik Water Pulsator; $40, waterpiksinusense.com). A saline nasal spray, like Simply Saline ($6, drugstore.com), offers similar benefits. Good to know: Clean your irrigator or neti pot with soap and water after every use. ""Without good hygiene, these can be vehicles for transmitting viruses and bacteria from person to person,"" says Ellert. Get a FREE TRIAL issue of Real Simple - CLICK HERE!

"(CNN) -- Ten skydivers and the pilot of a small private plane died Saturday when their aircraft crashed in a rural area southeast of Belgium's capital, a local municipality said. Emergency dispatch teams were dispatched to the crash site in Namur, a community about 70 kilometers (43 miles) southeast of Brussels, Belgian Fire Service spokesman Eric Lambert told CNN. They were joined later by Belgium's King Philippe, Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo and Interior Minister Joelle Milquet, the city of Namur said in a statement. An investigation being conducted by the Namur prosecutor's office is underway to determine why the plane went down, according to the city.

"(CNN) -- Wildlife photographer David ""Baz"" Jenkins seems to have a knack for photographing great white sharks. His website is filled with pictures of the fearsome predators leaping from the sea and devouring seals. But a photo Jenkins took during a July shark-watching cruise in South Africa is garnering the Irish photographer so much attention that his website was having trouble keeping up Wednesday after numerous media outlets published his shots. One photo shows a seal seemingly balanced on the tip of the rising shark's mouth, moments away from becoming a meal. Later photos in the series show the seal twisting away and escaping as the giant shark's jaws snap shut. ""This seal was one lucky pup,"" Jenkins told Caters News Agency. The seal was among a group returning to Seal Island off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa, after feeding when the shark struck, he said.

"(CNN) -- All future singers of the national anthem should pay close attention to James Taylor's performance at Game 2 of the World Series on October 24. If you're going to make a mistake, this is the way to make it. On Thursday, the musician was at Fenway Park in Boston to lead the stadium in a rendition of ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" But when he opened his mouth to sing, the words of ""America the Beautiful"" started pouring out. Rather than ""Oh, say can you see,"" Taylor kicked off the song with, ""Oh, beautiful ..."" But the singer quickly -- and rather smoothly -- recovered, going straight into the correct lyrics without missing a beat. While other singers have caught major flak for messing up the words to the national anthem at such events, Taylor did have an excuse: he was also performing ""America the Beautiful"" that same night during the seventh inning stretch. He was joined by several survivos of April's Boston Marathon attack.","James Taylor messed up his national anthem performance .

"(CNN) -- Senate Republicans on Thursday blocked a Democrat-backed bill that would have extended tax cuts to small businesses. Both sides indicated the vote was political one -- Democrats said Republicans blocked the bill to cost President Barack Obama political points.

"(CNN) -- Missed it by that much! In a year that forecasters said there would be a few more hurricanes than normal, Humberto on Wednesday fell just a few hours short of setting a record for the latest first hurricane to form in the Atlantic Ocean. Normally, three hurricanes would have formed in the area by this time in hurricane season. All that it had to do was wait until after 8 a.m. ET, but alas, no. Three hours ahead of that mark, the National Hurricane Center in Miami dubbed it a legitimate storm with sustained winds of a 75 mph, the threshold for a hurricane. But it's not likely to cause much of a fuss. Early Wednesday, it was about 310 miles west-northwest of the Cape Verde Islands, off Africa's coast. It's expected to fizzle into a tropical storm over the weekend. Back in May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center said higher-than-average water temperatures were expected to help yield a few more Atlantic hurricanes than usual. NOAA predicts above-normal Atlantic hurricane season . Between 13 and 20 named storms and seven to 11 hurricanes were predicted. Humberto is the eighth named storm of the year and, again, just the first hurricane. For the Atlantic Ocean, a normal season would produce 12 named storms, including six hurricanes and three major ones. There's still time, if you're rooting for more hurricanes. Hurricane season, which began on June 1, runs until November 30. CNN's Sean Morris contributed to this report.","2013 was almost a record-setter for latest first hurricane formation .

"(CNN) -- A rash of sexual assaults in the armed forces undermines Americans' confidence in the military, President Barack Obama told newly commissioned officers at the U.S. Naval Academy Friday. ""Those who commit sexual assault are not only committing a crime, they threaten the trust and discipline that makes our military strong,"" Obama told the graduates, who were commissioned as Naval ensigns and Marine Corps second lieutenants. ""That's why we have to be determined to stop these crimes. Because they have no place in the greatest military on Earth,"" Obama continued. The president's remarks came amid mounting outrage over sexual abuse cases in the armed forces. Figures show the rate of assaults in the armed forced increasing, and some top officers are under fire for condoning such acts. At least two officers responsible for preventing sexual assault are under investigation for allegedly committing the types of act they were tasked with stopping. Those factors have led to calls for major changes in how the armed forces handle sexual assaults. Obama has demanded his top military brass ""leave no stone overturned"" in their quest to prevent abuse, and members of Congress have introduced legislation that would make it easier for victims to get justice. In his commencement address Friday, Obama characterized the U.S. military as one of the few institutions Americans still trust, but said incidents like sexual assaults, as well as other delinquency by servicemen in the field, could erode that faith. ""Even in our military, we've seen how the misconduct of some can have effects that ripple far and wide. In our digital age, a single image from the battlefield of troops falling short of their standards can go viral and endanger our forces and undermine our efforts to achieve security and peace,"" Obama told the Naval Academy graduates, 206 of whom were women. Earlier this month, the Department of Defense released figures estimating 26,000 cases of unwanted sexual contact occurred in 2012, a 35% jump from 2010. Those cases ranged from groping to rape. The vast majority of those incidents went unreported as crimes, the study showed. Meanwhile, officers at bases across the country are under investigation for allegedly committing sexual assaults. An Army sergeant first class assigned to the sexual assault prevention unit at Fort Hood, Texas, came under investigation in early May for alleged sexual assault, pandering, abusive sexual contact and maltreatment of subordinates. The military said he's been relieved of duty while investigators look in to the allegations. Also in May, an Air Force officer who managed an assault prevention unit was charged with sexual battery and removed from duty. He is accused of grabbing a woman and groping her buttocks and breasts in an Arlington County parking lot not far from his Washington office. And this week, the Army said it had suspended Brig. Gen. Bryan Roberts, the top general at Fort Jackson in South Carolina, due to allegations of adultery and assault. Fort Jackson is where most new Army recruits go through basic training, which includes training about sexual assault prevention. The president traditionally delivers the commencement address at one of the military service academies every year. In 2012 he spoke at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. The last time he delivered the commencement in Annapolis was 2009. Vice President Joe Biden spoke last weekend at the Coast Guard Academy in Connecticut. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel will speak Saturday at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and also will address sexual assaults, according to a U.S. official. Obama's remarks came the day after a much-anticipated speech in which the president spelled out a new phase of America's war on terror. He told the new officers Friday they are entering a military vastly changed from four years ago. ""Just as you have changed in the past four years, so too have the challenges facing our military,"" he said, noting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were still being engaged when Friday's graduates entered the academy. ""Even as we move beyond deploying our large ground armies abroad, we need to conduct precise targeted strikes against terrorists before they kill our citizens,"" Obama said. ""Even as we stay vigilant in the face of terrorism, and stay true to our Constitution and values, we need to stay ready for the full range of threats."" CNN's Jim Acosta contributed to this report.","Obama says military assaults threaten what ""makes our military strong,""

"(CNN) -- A Texas white hat has crossed through the pearly gates. ""Bum"" Phillips, the former NFL football coach who led the Houston Oilers to glory and struggled with the New Orleans Saints, died Friday at age 90. ""Bum is gone to Heaven-loved and will be missed by all -great Dad, Coach, and Christian,"" tweeted his son Wade Phillips, himself defensive coordinator for the Houston Texans. Phillips' white Stetson cowboy hat was hard to miss, though he didn't wear it in domed stadiums -- his mother had told him never to wear his hat indoors. His nickname stuck out like a sore thumb, especially whenever his team's stakes were down and fans weren't being nice about it. He was born Oail Andrew Phillips in 1923, but his older sister stuttered and couldn't say ""brother."" It came out wrong, and the affectionate nickname was born, according to an official biography. It was an term of endearment that had no derogatory meaning. Bumisms . But Phillips' true trademark were the deadpan sayings he regularly dropped, fully original and spiced with humor and gritty truisms. They got him laughed at sometimes and admired at other times for their grains of truth. They were coined ""Bumisms."" His most famous one: ""There's two kinds of coaches, them that's fired and them that's gonna be fired."" He once told sportscaster Bob Costas that he took his wife on away games ""because she's too ugly to kiss goodbye,"" the NFL said. Phillips started his career in the 1950s as a high school coach, according to the NFL. He joined the Oilers in 1974 as defensive coordinator, when they were defeated and down, then advanced to head coach and in the late 1970s turned them into a winning team. The Oilers are now the Tennessee Titans and Houston's team is now the Texans. He had a reputation for being an affectionate motivator. The NFL ranked him among the 10 most motivational coaches in professional football history. Saints struggle . In 1981, Phillips -- wearing cowboy boots -- moved to New Orleans and tightened up the Saints' defense. Two years later, he led them to their second-ever non-losing season -- an 8-8 record, but he didn't have the same level of success that he had enjoyed in Houston. In 1985, he resigned to dedicate himself to ranching, his family and Christian charities, and didn't seem to miss football too much. ""I still love football,"" he told the NFL. ""You can't do something for 50 years and not love it, but I love it where it's at, and I love where I'm at"" -- his ranch in Goliad, Texas. According to local news reports, that's where he died. ""He meant a great deal to this franchise, the NFL and the city of Houston, and he was instrumental to the Oilers during the 'Luv Ya Blue' era,"" said Titans owner K.S. ""Bud"" Adams Jr., in a statement, referring to the late 1970s movement by Oilers' fans. ""Growing up in Texas and working his way up through the Texas football ranks, he was a natural match for our team. Those were such magical years, and his leadership and personality helped our team rise to the top. He became an iconic figure on our sideline.""

"(CNN) -- To help keep the peace with her in-laws during holidays, Julia Smith adopted a rule several years ago about talking politics: Don't do it, and don't take the bait if anyone starts in. Her relationship with her father-in-law in particular had always been fraught with tension, said Smith, who asked that her name be changed to preserve family relations. She was the ""screaming liberal from New York"" who'd corrupted his Texas-bred son into moving to ""Taxachusetts"" and voting Democrat. As far as she was concerned, he was a good ol' boy who didn't like to talk politics as much as preach his views. Her resolve was put to the test three years ago at Thanksgiving dinner, right after Barack Obama was elected president. She was picking at her turkey when, she says, her father-in-law suggested an act of violence toward Obama. She attempted to keep cool by gathering her children and leaving the table. But then he repeated it at dessert. ""I finally said to him, 'you can't use that language in front my children.' Then he told me, 'you can't tell me what I can say in my home.' That led to a tirade with all kinds of four-letter words and him storming out,"" she said. ""Before this, I just tried to ignore him, change the topic or walk away. But this comment ... it couldn't be ignored,"" she said. Unfortunately, things haven't been the same since, she says. They haven't spoken in more than two years, and he refuses to visit her family, though her mother-in-law visits regularly. Smith's case represents an extreme example of a Thanksgiving horror story, but most of us have one. The holidays tend to bring out the best and worst in people, especially among those we love. But as election season heats up, politics becomes an increasingly common topic around the dinner table ... as if we needed more stress when visiting family. ""Politics is dangerous because people identify so closely with their beliefs. For my father-in-law, it wasn't just who he would vote for but a part of who he was, and if you disagreed with his political beliefs, it was like it was a rejection of him,"" Smith said. ""For some people, political beliefs become too much a part of their personality, who they are, and they can't separate them from a person. That's where we ran into trouble, because I truly wanted to get along with this man, even though I didn't agree with him on most fronts. I still wanted to have a loving relationship for the sake of our family."" Politics may not be an easy topic for families with diverging viewpoints, but that doesn't mean it's off-limits, said etiquette expert Anna Post of the Emily Post Institute. In fact, people don't need to agree as long as they're capable of respectful back-and-forth, as opposed to testy debate. ""When people are willing to listen, which means not dominating the conversation and allowing yourself to be open to another idea, it can work,"" she said. ""You may already know what the other person's going to say, but letting their voice say it is where respect comes in."" Avoiding anger in your tone is another way to keep things healthy and family-functional, she said. ""It's about respect, not making judgments and not using words that carry judgments. Given what a big deal the political conversation is, I think it's one worth making an effort over."" With some, a respectful conversation just isn't in the cards, and we usually know who those people are, Post said. Identify the people who are your triggers, and be proactive in your conversation choices: Set the agenda and the tone, and don't let it be politics if you already know that a lively conversation won't come out of it. Another key consideration is what you hope to achieve by engaging in such a discussion. Are you there to change their mind or talk about what's going on in the news? If it's the former, you're probably barking up the wrong tree, and you may damage the relationship in the meantime, she said. It goes both ways, of course. If it becomes clear that someone is not just listening but trying to convert you, have some exit phrases on hand to end the conversation or lead it elsewhere, she said. Something like ""we'll have to agree to disagree"" or ""I'll consider what you said"" are good ways to get someone to let go and move on, Post said. If the conversation proceeds, choosing your words wisely could mean the difference between a lively back-and-forth and an uncomfortable standoff, she said. ""Don't assume other people believe what you believe. People will casually mention something about a candidate or a position or a piece of news and mention it in a way that clearly states a position and assumes everyone agrees with it. That can be deeply uncomfortable and, depending on the position, leave someone stifled in a conversation,"" Post said. In other words, leave the punditry to the pundits and focus on positions you can defend with facts instead of catchphrases. ""In your own language with politics, cleansing it of idioms can make it more about facts and not opinions,"" she said. ""The goal is to avoid polarizing language. For example, ask someone what they think about health care rather than 'Obamacare.' Talk about the facts you know as opposed to 'I can't believe those guys are always pulling that stuff.' It makes a big difference."" Not everyone goes by the same facts in the digital age, so even assuming that your facts are the ones everybody agrees on can land you in risky territory, said Jodi R.R. Smith, author of ""From Clueless to Class Act: Manners for the Modern Woman."" As much as you can prepare for the ones you love, a few variables inevitably pop up, such as the new significant other, the exchange student or the friend without a place to go. ""If someone brings home a new love interest, I'm going to hold back a little bit and say, 'what do you think of the debates so far?' so I will be able to gauge the new person's political leanings,"" she said. ""If we agree, that's great. I can launch into personal philosophies. If we don't agree, I will ask a couple of innocuous follow-up questions to see if this is someone who can have civilized political discourse. Maybe they can educate me, and it won't sway my vote, but it will make me a more well-rounded human being. If person gets red in the face and voice starts to rise, I will say, 'that's interesting.

"(CNN)  -- The United States and other Western powers have ""exacerbated Somalia's downward spiral"" and must revise their policies in the east African country, a Human Rights Watch report has warned. Recent image of Islamist fighters at a camp in the northern outskirts of Mogadishu . The report, released Monday, blames the policies under President George W. Bush for ""breeding the very extremism that it is supposed to defeat."" ""The new administration of U.S. President Barack Obama should urgently review U.S. policy in Somalia and the broader Horn of Africa and break with the failed approach of his predecessor,"" the report said. It also cites key European governments for failing ""to address the human rights dimensions of the crisis, with many officials hoping that somehow unfettered support to abusive TFG (Somali transitional government) forces will improve stability."" Somalia's weak transitional government, backed by Ethiopian forces, continues to battle Islamic militias with the fighting concentrated in the capital, Mogadishu. Ethiopian forces have not withdrawn from the country, as required under a recent cease-fire agreement. Ethiopia invaded Somalia two years ago and successfully routed the Islamic militia that seized control of the capital. The HRW report states that the United States ""directly backed Ethiopia's intervention."" Since the 2006 overthrow of the Islamic Courts Union, Somalia has suffered from ""unconstrained warfare and violent rights abuses"" by all warring parties. ""All sides have used indiscriminate force as a matter of routine, and in 2008 violence has taken on a new dimension with the targeted murders of aid workers and civil society activists,"" the report states. ""The human rights and humanitarian catastrophe facing Somalia today threatens the lives and livelihoods of millions of Somalis on a scale not witnessed since the early 1990s."" Heavy fighting in Mogadishu and across Somalia has driven more than a million people from their homes. The lawlessness has also spilled onto the seas off the Horn of Africa, where international vessels are routinely hijacked by suspected Somali pirates who demand large ransoms. Human Rights Watch offers specific recommendations to the Somali and Ethiopian governments, the main militias, and the international community to address the human rights abuses. It calls on the West to ""insist upon an end to the impunity that has fueled the worst abuses - and the right place to start is by moving the U.N. Security Council to establish a Commission of Inquiry to document abuses and lay the groundwork for accountability.""

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- The Cuban government announced Tuesday it plans to end the country's dual-currency system. Presently, most Cubans are paid in the Cuban peso, or CUP, while the vast majority of goods on the island are available only with the hard currency convertible peso, or CUC. Convertible pesos are pegged to the U.S. dollar, while the Cuban pesos are worth only about 4 cents each. Neither peso is accepted as currency outside of Cuba, where, according to government statistics, most Cubans make about $20 a month from their official salaries. The dual system came into being after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when Cuba introduced the U.S. dollar as the country's second currency. In 2004, the government replaced the dollar with the convertible peso. The dual-currency system is unpopular with many Cubans, who complain that the Cuban pesos they received their salaries in are not accepted in stores that carry sought-after imported goods. The announcement in the Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma said the change is to be a gradual process, but gave no timetable. ""The currency unification isn't a measure that will resolve on its own the current problems of the economy. But its adoption is vital to restoring value to the Cuban peso,"" the announcement in Granma read. For months, Cuban officials have said ending the two-currency system was a priority but the move would have a major impact on the government's gradual attempts to move from a centralized, communist-style economy. The announcement Tuesday said the Cuban central bank will continue to back both currencies and give Cubans time to convert their savings.","Cuba has two currencies: the Cuban peso, CUP, and the hard currency convertible peso, CUC .

"(CNN) -- Carly and her mom are friends on Facebook, but that doesn't mean they share everything. The 17-year-old from Marin County, California, has refined her Facebook privacy settings so that her mother can't see all the posts that fill her Timeline. Her father, meanwhile, never checks the social network. ""Right now, my mom can only see things that I post. She can't see anything I'm tagged in or anything that my friends say to me on my profile,"" said Carly, a high school senior who asked to be identified only by her first name. ""She doesn't know that, though. I'm like, 80% sure that every other teenager has done that too."" With teen-agers and their parents (grandparents, even) increasingly active on social networks, both generations are joined in a delicate dance over privacy, safety and freedom of expression online. Interviews with a handful of teens and adults suggest that some teens seek out corners of social media where they can communicate with their friends and peers away from the watchful eye, or embarrassing comments, of their parents. Parents, meanwhile, are grappling with how to monitor their kids' online activity and keep them safe without being stifling or intrusive. And both are seeking ways to coexist peacefully on the few social networks they do share. Reputation is everything . Today's teenagers are social media natives. They've grown up putting their personal information online and are comfortable sharing photos and videos of themselves, updating relationship statuses and checking into locations. What they don't share their parents' level of concern about privacy and worries about companies or the government abusing their data. According to a recent study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, only 9% of teens reported being ""very concerned"" about third parties accessing their data. That doesn't mean they're reckless with their personal information, according to Pew research. Most teens exert careful control over what information is seen by whom, but more because they are acutely aware of how each nugget of posted information, even the number of likes it can get, shapes how they are perceived by peers. Pew found that teens have developed a variety of ways to control their privacy. They are comfortable navigating Facebook's notoriously complicated privacy settings, and only 14% have public-facing Facebook profiles. They also edit what appears on their profile, deleting posts, comments and unwanted tags. For teens looking to hide social-media activity from adults, elaborate privacy settings can sometimes be unnecessary. Fifty-eight percent of teens said they posted updates that were inside jokes or coded messages that only certain friends would understand. Seeking out new online homes . Many teens are learning how to compartmentalize the different parts of their lives online. Facebook is the most popular site for both teens and parents, according to Pew, but teens reported ""waning enthusiasm"" in the site in Pew focus groups. They cited the colonization of the site by adults and excessive amounts of ""drama."" Some teens use Facebook for public posts but message each other on lesser-known social platforms that their parents aren't aware of or haven't signed up for. Many teens are also on Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Vine and Pinterest -- sites where they report feeling less social pressure and more freedom to express themselves. Twitter has seen rapid growth among young users, while Vine, with its looping six-second videos, is a creative form of messaging for a visually oriented generation. Even straight-laced LinkedIn is courting teenagers. Earlier this month the social media site for professionals lowered its minimum age to 14 from 18 and announced special new pages for universities, hoping to edge into the college-selection process. If teenagers really don't want something to be seen, they'll retreat to more private messaging tools such as Kik, WhatsApp or Snapchat, which can be used to send private messages to groups of friends. SnapChat is a mobile app which lets users share photos or videos that disappear after a few seconds. For that reason, it's gained a reputation for promoting the exchange of risquÃ© images. ""On Snapchat ... anything goes!"" said Carly, the Bay Area teen. ""Snapchat gets a little crazier because it's supposed to be 'erased' after 10 seconds or less. Not sure if that's actually true, but there's definitely a different sense of security with Snapchat than Facebook or Instagram."" Making peace with parents . Some kids and parents say they have worked out ways to share social networks harmoniously. According to the recent Pew study, only 5% of teens reported setting up filters for their parents, and the majority (70%) are friends with their parents on Facebook. Julie LaRue and her 16-year-old daughter are both mainly on Facebook, but the two have agreed on some boundaries. ""Her ground rule for me is to not comment on her friends' comments unless they are directed to me, and not to tag her in photos without her consent,"" said LaRue, who lives in Baldwinsville, New York. LaRue also stays off of her daughter's other social networks, including Tumblr, Twitter and DeviantArt. In exchange, her daughter is heeding her warnings against sharing personal information online and has promised not to post any photos she wouldn't be comfortable showing her parents. Along the same lines, Carly's mom will tag her daughter in photos and like her posts, but she doesn't comment much because she knows it's embarrassing to her daughter. Carly, for her part, tries to keep it clean. ""I really try to not have any pictures of me from any parties or any captions/comments with swear words ... but it's hard to be 100% clean when your entire life is online,"" she said.","Teens and their parents are grappling with how to navigate shared online spaces like Facebook .

Bill Young was surrounded by family when he died at 6:50 p.m. at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. ""The cause of death was complications related to a chronic injury,"" Glenn said. News of Young's death came two days after his family said in a statement that he was ""gravely ill."" The 22-term representative wasn't on the House floor for the vote on reopening the government and raising the debt ceiling. Just last week, he announced that he wouldn't run for another term. ""It's my time,"" the 82-year-old told the Tampa Bay Times in a phone interview. As to why he was retiring, Young said, ""I don't know that I would pick out one thing. It's a lot of things."" Among them, Young said, was his frustration with congressional gridlock. ""I'm a little disappointed. It seems there's too much politics. It's a different Congress,"" he told the Times. Young was first elected to the House in November 1970. After serving 10 years in the Florida State Senate and 43 years in the U.S. House, Young spent more than half a century in elected office.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Jenni Hunt is an attractive, talented and ambitious professional from Portland, Oregon. She runs her own Internet business, selling on online auction site eBay and advising others how to navigate the site to gain maximum profits. Carrie Stevens says working online means she can spend more time with her daughter Amie. Jenni, 36, is also a full-time mother who home-schools her kids. Superwoman? Perhaps. But Jenni is one of an increasing number of stay-at-home moms who are using the Internet to have it all. Jenni was a high-tech Silicon Valley marketing executive when, in 1999, she gave up work to look after her baby boy. She had her second child in 2002, and it was then that she discovered eBay. ""I had bought a stroller for $15 and a couple of months later realized it wasn't fitting my needs, so I decided to sell it on eBay,"" she told CNN. ""I made over $100! I was hooked."" Jenni, a self-confessed bargain-hunter, quickly realized that she could use the Internet to plump up her family's finances. ""We couldn't survive on my husband's income, so it was necessary for me to contribute somehow,"" she said. ""I just couldn't bring myself to leave my children -- and I knew I had skills that would allow me to freelance or create my own business."" Jenni began to sell regularly on eBay, specializing in children's items. After a while, it struck her that her experience could be valuable to others, and so she set up HuntedTreasure.com, a Web site that offers advice to other eBay sellers specializing in children's goods. Jenni's subscription newsletters, downloadable e-books, auction templates and online mentoring now help her add to the family's budget. Vancouver mother-of-two Alice Seba says the Internet offers a sense of community. Jenni's not alone as a stay-at-home mom and Internet entrepreneur. Alice Seba, a 35-year-old Vancouver mother of two, runs Internetbasedmoms.com, a site with resources for parents who run their own Internet businesses. She told CNN that the Internet offers stay-at-home parents the chance to earn an income from home. ""Whether it's extra spending money or to build a fully-fledged business, it's up to them,"" she said. And Alice sees the Internet as offering valuable support to mothers who can sometimes start to feel isolated. ""The Internet makes it easier to connect with other moms while the kids are asleep, or when mom gets a free moment,"" she told CNN. ""They're all in the same boat, so theirs is an instant understanding and connection."" While many of the people Alice has met online don't live close to her geographically, she says the Internet can offer an enormous sense of community and support. ""I've seen moms on the brink of leaving their husbands receive the most incredible advice that makes them turn things around,"" she confided. ""I'm definitely not saying the Internet saves marriages, but without that connection and support, a stay-at-home mom may have made a completely different decision."" Alice says the Internet can give moms a big boost in confidence. In a family where the husband is the main breadwinner, working from home can increase a wife's self-worth -- both psychologically and literally. Alice told CNN, ""In addition to the monetary gain, [mothers] can feel a sense of accomplishment and eliminate some of the guilt of not contributing to the family finances."" She continued, ""Of course, there's no shame in 'just being a stay-at-home mom.' It's one of the most important jobs in the world, but moms can feel guilty about it."" The benefits that mothers can bring to their own businesses are starting to be appreciated by workplaces, too. Carrie Stevens, 29, is a Chicago-based witty, dynamic Internet early adopter. She's been surfing, chatting and blogging for some years, so when she and her husband Jason had daughter Amie in 2004, it seemed natural to her to seek work online. Carrie was snapped up by LiveJournal.com, a San Francisco-based blogging site owned by Internet company Six Apart. She works full-time supervising their volunteer-run support center, which gives LiveJournal users technical help and advice. Carrie told CNN, ""I clock about seven to eight hours a day. This is intertwined with Amie's needs. I'm lucky that she's mostly independent with an active imagination and is content to play by herself for periods of time."" Carrie's job is flexible enough to fit around the interruptions that motherhood brings. She says, ""Last week I was in the middle of a serious business discussion that I had to place on hold for two minutes so I could 'fly over' to where Amie was playing Baby Bird in the laundry basket and 'feed' her."" And Carrie's work colleagues don't mind her dual status as mother and co-worker. She says, ""They think it's cute. I'm glad I have such a flexible workplace and a supervisor who understands that I'll get everything done at the end of the day although my work concentration might get broken up from time to time with cleaning up spilled cereal, reading a story that she just has to hear, and cuddling if she has a gloomy day."" Carrie's supervisor, Denise Paolucci, believes home workers can bring companies great benefits. She told CNN, ""It's a great combination for both the employees and the company. The staff gets the flexibility necessary to run their home lives and their work lives at the same time, and the company gets employees who are more committed to a company that's willing to allow that sort of flexibility."" Denise, whose department is composed entirely of home workers, also believes that working from home isn't just an advantage for her team. ""We as a company benefit considerably from flex time and other setups that benefit caregivers working from home, because of the international and 24/7 nature of our business,"" she told CNN. ""By having staff who are looking for flexibility in their schedules, we expand our times of coverage considerably."" And she feels that it gives her a larger pool of prospective employees to choose from when recruiting. ""By allowing for remote telecommuting, we're not limited simply to candidates based around our offices,"" she said. ""We can find the absolute right candidate, whether that person is living in New Hampshire or New Zealand."" Carrie admits that working from home isn't without its challenges. She told CNN that at times she feels a little isolated from her colleagues. ""Sometimes I feel a bit left out of those spontaneous meetings, the ones coworkers can have easily in an office when they're passing by each others' desks,"" she said. And teleconferencing isn't always ideal: as she explained, ""If I'm on a conference call, it's often hard to get a word in edgewise -- everyone else can see each other but they can't see my non-verbal cues that I have something to say."" Carrie adds that sometimes it's hard to walk away from work at the end of the day. She said, ""Sometimes work is a bit too convenient, especially because I'm used to work and family being so intertwined anyway. Since my office is my dining room table, it's always right there."" Jenni Hunt backs this up. She told CNN, ""It's important to me to have set times when I'm working and set times when I'm not. If I don't do this, I could work all day."" And it cuts both ways: family can distract from work, too. Jenni says, ""The distractions of home provide the biggest downside. There are dishes to be done, dinner to prepare, homework to help with -- and children who just want to play."" But the benefits of working from home -- flexibility, more family time, support and independence -- outweigh the downsides. Jenni says, ""Being successful with my home business has allowed me to dream bigger. I could easily do this full-time -- but I do it because I want to be home with my kids. I am able to homeschool and participate in my children's lives in ways I couldn't if I had to go to a J.O.B. I'm reminded of this every time they interrupt me while I'm working on my laptop in the family room while they play."" Carrie also values the opportunity she has to combine work and time with her daughter. She told CNN, ""I really feel like I have the best of both worlds in this situation. If Amie went to child care every day, I'd miss the chance to play games with her and read to her."" ""We can take lunch breaks at the park or walk to a nearby coffee shop for sandwiches if it's a nice day,"" she continued. ""If I were working at an office, this wouldn't be possible."" .................................. Are you an Internet mom? Would you like to work from home and spend more time with your kids?

"(CNN) -- It's not over in Steubenville, Ohio. Although a judge has found two Steubenville teenagers guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl in a case that showcased jaw-dropping examples of teenage alcohol use and tawdry text messaging -- all wrapped in allegations of a cover-up -- Ohio's attorney general said Monday it's now time for a grand jury to look at whether anyone else should be charged. ""I think the Steubenville community needs really two things. One is to get this over with,"" Attorney General Mike DeWine said in a nod to frustration the continued investigation is likely to cause in the city -- a small, down-on-its-luck Ohio River mill town that's been the focus of intense criticism and media coverage for months. ""But the other is to believe that justice has been done, that we have left no stone unturned and that anyone who is criminally liable has been brought to justice,"" he said. Healing process after rape never ends . The victim's mother told CNN that the verdicts are ""the start of a new beginning for my daughter."" But she added, ""We need to stress the importance of helping those in need and to stand up for what is right."" ""We hope that from this something good can arise,"" she said. ""I feel I have an opportunity to bring an awareness to others, possibly change the mentality of a youth or help a parent to have more of an awareness to where their children are and what they are doing. The adults need to take responsibility and guide these children."" But the emotions inflamed by the case echoed past Sunday's verdict, with sheriff's deputies and state investigators arresting two teenage girls Monday for threatening the victim over Twitter. The girls -- one 15, one 16, both from Steubenville -- were in a juvenile lockup Monday night, awaiting an appearance before a judge Tuesday morning, Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla said. Grand jury . DeWine said state investigators have examined tens of thousands of text messages, images and videos and talked to 56 witnesses -- from teenagers who attended the parties to assistant football coaches and the high school principal. But 16 people who may know something about what happened that August night have refused to talk, he said. ""I have reached the conclusion that this investigation cannot be completed -- that we cannot bring finality to this matter -- without the convening of a grand jury,"" he said in a statement Sunday. Opinion: Steubenville case shows how the rules have changed . The grand jury will begin meeting around April 15 and could take ""a number of days"" to complete its work, DeWine said. ""And I should point out that the convening of a grand jury, of course, does not necessarily mean that indictments will be returned or that charges will be filed,"" he said. ""A grand jury is an investigative tool that is uniquely suited to ensure fairness and to complete this investigation,"" DeWine said in the Sunday statement. ""And this community needs assurance that no stone has been left unturned in our search for the truth."" Guilty verdicts . DeWine's announcement of the grand jury came shortly after Judge Thomas Lipps found Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, guilty of rape. Lipps, who was hearing the case without a jury, also found Mays guilty of disseminating a nude photo of a minor. Authorities accused Mays and Richmond of putting their fingers in the girl's vagina while she was too drunk to consent, an act that constitutes rape under Ohio law. The incident took place during a series of alcohol-fueled end-of-summer parties in August. Some of the abuse was documented in photographs shown in court and in texts read aloud during testimony, including one text in which a state forensics investigator testified Mays wrote, ""I should have raped since everyone thinks I did."" Trial focuses on text messages . Lipps sentenced Mays to a minimum of two years in a juvenile correctional facility. Richmond received a minimum of one year. Juvenile authorities could decide to keep both in custody until they turn 21. Richmond's father, Nathaniel Richmond, said he still believed his son was innocent ""even though he apologized in the courtroom."" ""The evidence they had against Ma'lik was minimal,"" he told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" ""Ma'lik was just at the wrong place at the wrong time. I know my son is not a rapist, even though he has been convicted of rape."" Both Mays and Richmond must undergo treatment and will have to register as sex offenders, Lipps ruled. Richmond's attorney, Walter Madison, said his client would appeal in an attempt to avoid that designation. Meanwhile, the victim and her family remain under guard after the threats were posted online, Abdalla told CNN. ""She continues to be a victim and be victimized ... over and over,"" he said. ""And that's what's sad."" One of the tweets that led to Monday's arrests warned that if the poster saw the victim, ""it's gone be a homicide."" Another threatened a beating. The girl accused of tweeting the death threat turned herself in after learning that investigators were looking for her, the sheriff said. Nevertheless, ""They're going to have to answer to it,"" he said. ""We're dealing with kids, again,"" Abdalla said. ""But the attorney general had just left the building -- the judge was still in the building -- when I received messages that there's death threats already against the victim."" No charges had been announced against the suspects Monday night, but ""There's no question they're going to prosecute."" ""I hope this sends a warning,"" he said. ""And I can assure you, we've been monitoring Twitter for 24 hours and continue to. If there's anybody else there crosses a line and makes a death threat, they're going to have to face the consequences."" Internet outrage . The case received widespread attention after a blogger who once lived in Steubenville uncovered some of the materials posted to social media sites. The blogger, Alexandria Goddard, wrote pointedly about the possibility that the teenagers had been given preferential treatment because they played on the town's highly regarded football team. Police have denied that claim. Later, the loosely organized hacker group Anonymous got involved, posting a lengthy video in which another teenager -- who has not been charged -- made joking references to the rape. The ensuing ire over the case brought national attention and criticism to the city from around the country, leaving city officials struggling to defend the community and residents weary of the media spotlight. Teen rape trial shines unwelcome spotlight on Ohio town . Broader problem . Acknowledging the town's frustration, DeWine said Monday that it would be a mistake to focus on one small Ohio community, to think something unique in its culture is behind the incident. ""I'm afraid people are going to walk away and say this was all about Steubenville,"" DeWine said. ""It's not. It's a cultural problem."" ""I'll guarantee that there are crimes very similar to this that occur every Friday night and every Saturday night in communities across this country where you have people, particularly young people, who are drinking too much and a girl is taken advantage of, and a girl is raped,"" he said. Such incidents stem from a larger social problem -- a rampant lack of respect and human decency, he said. ""One of the lessons of life is we have to take care of each other, and we have to try to help people and we have to do what's right."" DeWine said. ""And there were precious few people that night that were doing what was right."" Teens treated girl 'like a toy,' prosecutor says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Officials are hopeful that the chamber containing the Lincoln statue at the Lincoln Memorial, which was vandalized overnight, can be reopened sometime Friday, National Park Service spokeswoman Carol Johnson told reporters. The memorial's portico -- the columned area outside the chamber -- should be reopen before that, in the late morning, she said. Workers are cleaning the paint that had been splashed onto part of the marble statue, she said. Watch: Obama surprises visitors at the Lincoln Memorial . Vandals splashed green paint on the base of the statue overnight, prompting officials to temporarily close the marble fixture on Washington's National Mall, authorities said. Police were alerted just before 1:30 a.m. and found paint splattered on the leg and base of the 19-foot-tall statue of Abraham Lincoln, U.S. Park Police Capt. Steven Booker told CNN on Friday. There were no discernible letters or markings. The memorial will be closed until it is cleaned up, Booker said. The memorial, one of the more iconic features of Washington, honors the 16th U.S. president. The marble statue of a seated Lincoln resides in nearly 100-foot-high columned marble building facing the U.S. Capitol and the Washington Monument. More than 6 million people visited the Lincoln Memorial in 2012, the National Park Service says. Dedicated in 1922, it has been the site of a number of protests and gatherings, including the 1963 March on Washington, during which Martin Luther King Jr. gave his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech from the steps of the memorial.

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods has not held golf's No. 1 ranking since October 2010, but he is now within touching distance of adding to his record 623 weeks at the top. The 14-time major champion can topple Luke Donald by winning the World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational tournament for the eighth time as long as the Englishman finishes no higher than third come Sunday. ""It would be nice to get back there because obviously it meant that as far as I had dropped, to build my way back up to this point, I've had some wins, I've had some very high finishes, I've been consistent,"" said Woods, who dropped as low as 58th following his well-publicized divorce and injury problems. ""That's how you get to be one of the top players in the world. To be ranked as low as I did and then come all the way back to, as of right now, No. 2, that's pretty good.""

""This year I've taken the steps headed in the right direction and shot better scores and been more consistent.

"(CNN) -- The Israeli military calculated the number of calories residents of Gaza needed to avoid malnutrition during Israel's embargo from 2007 to 2010, according to a document released Wednesday under court order. A spokesman for the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories said the document was a draft that was never implemented. ""No action was ever carried out based on the paper,"" a written statement said. Gisha, an Israeli human rights group, said it acquired two versions of the study from 2008. The document concluded that 106 trucks per day could bring the appropriate amount of food, medicine, hygiene items and agricultural ""inputs."" The group said that was in contrast to the more than 400 trucks that entered Gaza before June 2007. ""How can Israel claim that it is not responsible for civilian life in Gaza when it controls even the type and quantity of food that Palestinian residents of Gaza are permitted to consume?"" said Sari Bashi, executive director of Gisha. Gisha said the 106-truck standard was the model for what Israel Deputy Defense Minister Matan Vilnai approved, and it demanded Israel allow the free passage of goods. Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas spokesman, said: ""This is good evidence against Israel. We will use this report against Israel to show its crimes against humanity."" Israel had enacted a ban on the import of many goods after the Hamas takeover of Gaza in 2007. Israel, the United States and the European Union consider the Islamist group a terrorist organization. Israel is concerned that Hamas will use some materials for the purpose of attacking its territory. Israel eased its food embargo in 2010.

"(CNN) -- Cool, calm and collected, Mario Monti could not be more different from Italy's flamboyant former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The former European commissioner on Sunday was nominated to succeed Berlusconi. Italian President Giorgio Napolitano announced Wednesday that he had nominated Monti as a ""senator for life,"" a title bestowed on those who have held distinguished roles, heightening speculation about his candidacy. If he becomes prime minister, Monti could be expected to bring a distinctly different approach to governing than Italy has experienced over the past three years. While the hot-blooded Berlusconi was for many years a master of forming political alliances, Monti is known for his achievements as a ""Eurocrat,"" at the heart of Europe's institutions. Dubbed Super Mario for his work in international finance, he served as a leading European Commission member for a decade -- including as commissioner for its financial services, market and taxation committee between 1995 and 1999 and as head of its competition committee from 1999 to 2004. In the latter role, Monti gained prominence for his part in blocking a merger between U.S. firms Honeywell International and General Electric, thought to be a move that highlighted Europe's newfound regulatory clout. He also tangled with U.S. computing giant Microsoft, ruling in 2004 that it had broken EU competition law by having ""abused its virtual monopoly power over the PC desktop in Europe."" Microsoft was hit with a huge fine and ordered to share key information with its rivals. While such moves made headlines, Monti's interactions in business are still a stark contrast to that of Berlusconi. Besides being active in politics, the outgoing prime minister is also a business personality as the owner of media and financial companies, as well as the legendary football club A.C. Milan. But beyond advisory roles with investment firm Goldman Sachs and Coca-Cola, Monti's resume suggests he's as much a creature of academics and policy-making as business. Born in 1943 in the town of Varese in northern Italy's Lombardy region, Monti earned an economics and business degree from Milan's Bocconi University. He then did his post-graduate studies at Yale University, before returning to Europe. In 2005, shortly after leaving the European Commission, according to a bio on that international organization's website, Monti launched Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank focused on economic issues. The next few years saw Monti remain busy in international affairs. That includes being appointed by French President Nicolas Sarkozy to a panel to look at promoting French economic growth, as well as helping broker a 2008 electricity-sharing agreement between France and Spain. All the while, he has appeared to remain closely linked to his alma mater, Bocconi. Holding the position rector from 1989 to 1994, the university notes that Monti is president of the school. CNN's Nina Dos Santos contributed to this report.","Mario Monti has been nominated to succeed Silvio Berlusconi as prime minister .

"New York (CNN) -- Barneys' internal review of accusations of racial bias toward customers absolves employees of racial profiling and places the blame on the police. The review states that ""Barneys employees did not request, require, nor initiate the actions of the New York Police Department"" in stopping and detaining the two African-American customers who were wrongly accused of credit card fraud. The report by the retailer reviewed two incidents earlier this year -- one involving Kayla Phillips, 21, who was stopped after making a purchase at Barneys, and Trayon Christian, 19, who was detained for questioning after a purchase. Both shoppers claimed they were targeted by Barney's employees and NYPD officers because of their race. The report also claims to have found no Barneys policy, written or unwritten, directing employees of the Loss Prevention department to engage in racial profiling and points out the department has a formal policy against racial profiling. Barneys is not the only major retailer facing accusations of racial profiling. Jenny Mendez, a former New York Police Department officer who lost her job after a shoplifting, has filed lawsuit seeking $40 million in damages from Macy's. Mendez was tried and found not guilty of shoplifting. At the trial, a Macy's detective admitted to lying on internal paperwork, saying Mendez admitted guilt when she had not, according to court transcripts. Mendez and her attorney claim she was stopped because she is Hispanic. Mendez and her mother were shopping at a Macy's store in New York City on November 23, 2012, when she was detained. Her lawsuit, filed on November 13, 2013, is independent of the class-action lawsuit against Macy's and the NYPD filed by ""Treme"" actor Rob Brown, said Mendez's attorney, Philip Karasyk. Brown's suit claims he was racially profiled while shopping at a Macy's store in June. NY attorney general investigating racial profiling claims . In the Barneys case, Michael Yaki, who serves on the U.S. Commission of Civil Rights, conducted the review of the high-end retailer's actions and policies after public allegations of racial profiling, according to the retailer. Michael Bartholomew Palillo, an attorney representing Christian in a civil suit against the department store, disputed the findings and said the report is self-serving. ""I can see how they're trying to do damage control,"" he said, ""but it's not like police officers are just hanging out in stores waiting for people to commit crimes. They're in stores because people call them."" The NYPD did not return requests for comment Wednesday.
